{"text":"I ended up in this restaurant by accident. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because their nachos were not enough for 2 people, they had to refill our basket twice since we were munching on them like they were the last snack on earth. As soon as we walked into this place I felt I was eating at an upscale museum, the décor is simply beautiful and refreshing and I even told my friend I feel I am not in Arizona, feels like we are somewhere in Mexico. I ordered their lemon salmon with veggies and rice, again food is very flavorful but to me the rice was too small not enough, the salmon was a good portion but rice and veggies to me didn't fill the plate cause I wanted more. I would definitely come back with friends and try something new on the menu or maybe order the same salmon again since I wanted more, it was very tasty with the lemon butter on top. The waitress was sweet and helpful, our order didn't take too longer to come to our table. I was a  happy customer."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!!! Absolutely fabulous food. Very very friendly service. Great atmosphere. Three different types of salsa. There is a fourth very hot salsa you have to ask for. Plus now they have a new Rewards card."}
{"text":"wouldnt you agree that a key part of enjoying the dining experience in part depends upon the company you are dining with?!  having said that, the times i have dined at abuelos have been with my fellow co-workers, all female, and yes, we all get along!  needless to say, we had totally fun & memorable experiences, filled with great conversations, great food and good prices.  their corn chips are fresh and lite, their salsa comes in different levels of heat.  i usually request the hot salsa.  i'm partial to their chicken enchilada.  portions are just right, one is plenty for me, usually served with rice.  in all fairness, believe i need to sample other dishes, before i could rate it any higher.  found another great restaurant in chandler, az!  top3 reasons why...1- great tasting dish 2- good value  3- atmosphere (location, service, ambience)"}
{"text":"This place is like a mexican Ceasar's Palace - the food is awesome!! You have to have the papas con chile - it is wonderful and makes for a change from the standard rice and bean side dishes.  The salsa is fabulous and my hubby likes the was salsa, you have to ask for it specifically.  The plates are generous and the service is outstanding.  This is one of our favorite places to go!  Lunch specials go until 4pm including Sat and Sunday.   MMMmmm MMMMMmmmm MMMMMmmmm!!"}
{"text":"Great food, service and atmosphere!  Our server Timothy checked on us regularly and kept out drinks full and cup basket full.  We had a very enjoyable dinner and we will come back."}
{"text":"Our server was great. The food was good, we ordered the bacon shrimps and it was average for the price. The mojito drink was good. We will go back! And the fact that they have games on their iPad for kids for $2 was pretty clever."}
{"text":"I went with my family to celebrate father's day. 

I will start with the positives. delicious food, great decor, friendly servers, tasty drinks, quick service, yadda yadda yadda.

My only complaint would be the hostesses. They were both polite enough with the \"Welcome to abuelos\" \"thanks for coming\" but paired with the least enthusiastic manner. They lacked personality. The girls both looked like they were not thrilled to be there. 

If the hostesses made me feel like they were glad to have me then I would've given the restaurant five stars! I would recommend eating here. Hostesses will not ruin your meal."}
{"text":"I was not happy with what I ate. I ordered the 3 variety fajitas. I had to send it back due to the steak being so raw.  The rice was cold and the beans were dry. Now, I'm not sure if I want to go back. Quite frankly I've had better Mexican food elsewhere."}
{"text":"My love and I went here on our date night this week. We were served by Gabriel. He was awesome! He was very attentive and pleasant. We only ordered drinks and an appetizer- Queso Flameado Supremo. It was gross, and I'm saying that politely. It looked like it came straight out of the can. Yuck. Gabriel offered us  four different styles of salsa with our complimentary chips before ordering. All of them scrumptious. Joe and I have both been here before. Although we don't frequent this restaurant I wanted to enjoy the courtyard and good conversation If you request to sit in the \"courtyard\" with its beautiful blue skies. It reminds me of the shopping district in Vegas."}
{"text":"Bland and overly processed food. Weak margaritas.  Good service, but overall disappointing experience food wise."}
{"text":"This reminded me of the upscale restaurants of hotels in Mexico during my time working there.  To the uninitiated it may seem too Americanized, but trust me; the portions, quality and environment compares well to those in Mexico.

Mostly enchiladas and fajitas, but a nice variety.  Free chips and salsa, with many interesting appetizers to chose to order.

This trip I didn't have a chance to experiment, but my wife and I shared the Triple Flavor Fajitas and still took a box of leftovers home for later.  If you leave hungry you forgot to eat.

We will surely return.  I'll let you know more then"}
{"text":"Average Mexican food served in a Vegas style setting.

We have been eating here for years during baseball Spring Training and other sporting trips. The food is REALLY average and pricey. The place is usually filled with seniors since it is quiet unlike some of the more rowdy margarita bar places (Camarone's, El Torito, etc...). The ambiance is pleasant enough with a Cesar's Palace fake sky ceiling, but at best is a \"safe\" place to eat with no real endearing qualities for food or service. If you're not inclined to be adventurous, it is safe, but that's about it."}
{"text":"Have been here to dine a few times. and went for happy hour on a friday night.  Very decent prices and the food is great. The place was busy but we are able to belly up to the bar. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Not vegan/vegetarian friendly at all. The beans have bacon in them. The server was able to hook it up with some veggie fajitas, off the menu, but still not exactly the kind of thing I would really want to pay money for.

Felt a bit sick after words, so my assumption is that either the food was tainted or that I accidentally ate some sort of animal protein that my body is not able to digest well.

The only reason why I'm not giving Abuelo's is because my server was super helpful in finding me something to eat."}
{"text":"A corporate type of place, reminded me of Bravos decor... The Margarita was good and the food (Fajitas) was excellent. Not a large portion but it was good for lunch. Service was great and friendly."}
{"text":"Awesome environment here, I will definitely come back! The food was very reasonable and I felt like the portions were big enough for 2 people which is great! Manager came over to thank us and ask how the restaurant  experience was for us. Very class act. I will highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place, but it just didn't quite make the grade.   The décor was wonderful, almost Vegas-like.  Very busy.  The service was really good, but the food.... well, it was just kind of bland and not very exciting.  My girlfriend and I both noted that it was nothing special, just sort of run of the mill.  And, to top it off, they got her meat in her meal wrong.  I doubt we will go back."}
{"text":"Pretty good food, fairly traditional American Mexican food. But good service and nice interior.

Our food took a bit long to arrive, maybe about 40 minutes, and the manager came out, apologized, and gave it to us for free without us having to say a word. Certainly above what I would have expected."}
{"text":"Pretty much the as all other valley mexican. Food decent but overpriced, you know it mexican food, half the plate is rice and beans, costs .40 cents but your bill is 13-14 dollars plus tip."}
{"text":"The seared tuna is spiced so well, and the accompanying dipping sauce is delicious. The Monterrey provides a delicious variety of enchiladas, with a relleno and taco. 

After I found a piece of a thin plastic bag in my spinach enchilada, the manager apologized and not only replaced my enchilada, but offered dessert on the house. Apart from that, service was decent, and it makes for a classy and family-friendly date spot."}
{"text":"I have always been fond of Abuelos. Our go to place for any colleagues birthday or celebration. I like the place  for its ambiance, food and chips/salsa.

This location has been a little underwhelming. The staff was good, but the service was really slow. It took a lot of time for the food to arrive and the food was OK. Not the taste that I am used to though..

May be back some time later.."}
{"text":"Great food. Decent service. The waitress we had gave the wrong change back and when we pointed it out, she was very flippant. Otherwise everything was good."}
{"text":"What's good about this  place? Is it the bagged tortilla chips with chemical salsa, the Chi-Chi's feel, or the overpriced, bland food? I went here with low expectations and left wondering if I've ever felt worse about forty dollars being spent."}
{"text":"THEY MUST REALLY HATE WISCONSIN
Okay, so why, when the largest population of immigrants to the U.S. is mexican, did I go to a chain restaurant in the middle of a suburb when you could go to a smaller, less expensive place with better food and eat there?  And who hates Wisconsin?

First, it was late (2:30PM), and we didn't want to go too far.  We were staying near the Green-something Mall. 

Second, if there were any mexicans working in the kitchen of Abuelo's (meaning \"grandfather\" in spanish) they must really hate Wisconsin or have originally migrated there from Sweden, 'cause the food was just passable as mexican.  Ah, I see now that in Mexico, our \"grandfather\" never cooks.  I should have looked for a restaurant called Abuela's.

This place has the potential to be filled all the time because the food is too good to pass up.  It has the atmosphere of a beautiful mexican estate (not farm or ranch), and plenty of room to accomodate people.  I have never been there at night, so I have no idea.

Chips - stale, already a bad sign because we were not drunk to not notice.  We were starving, though, so we ate them.

Appetizers - Queso and guacamole - Guacamole was great.  Queso is a preference, but it was little thin and lacked, and I am surprised to say it in Wisconsin of all places, a CHEESE flavor.  Maybe it was too much milk in the mix.  A hint of red pepper and a thicker consistency is needed.

Drinks - Big, quick and good.  Nice presentation, no issue.

Fajita tacos - steak meat was nicely served and passable to okay.  It may have been overmarinated, but the plate should be hot and sizzling.  Check my review of Uncle Julio's Hacienda - much better in Chicago.

Fixings - about two lbs of grilled onion, two rings of green pepper, no tomato or japapeno.  Mexican beans were great, guacamole, cheese, cilantro were all fresh.

Salsa - thin and bitter, meaning they used stems or it was a bit too old.  It could have been the last of the batch (again due to the late arrival).

Guacamole - the only shining light; it was flavorful, fresh and perfectly seasoned.  

Service - passable, but I only got one refill on my ice tea at 2:30PM (1 of 5 tables in this 5000 sq ft place).

We were the hot, tired, starving people with moola looking to spend  some bucks on amazing food - not spicy, not piled high, not super high quality, but well executed, hot (or properly cold), inviting, simple dishes that people will order by the HUNDREDS and have a line at any time of the day.  At the time we went, I felt this place really needs to work on the execution at any time of the day.  If their lunch or dinner is great, which I expect it would be with all the turnover at that time, then they have to do well at ANY time of the day.  

I think they could really be the BEST upscale mexican place in the entire Madison area and crush everyone if they stick to a couple of things:
- Fresh
- Hot when hot, cold when cold
- Execute the simple perfectly (i.e. salsa, chips)
- Anytime and everytime"}
{"text":"Me and my family eat there for lunch on Tuesday 7/26/16 my two kids had stomach problems after and the next day had to take my little one to the Dr. I never write reviews this is the first one."}
{"text":"As a vegan I am pretty good at finding great food on menus at non vegan restaurants.  I was super disappointed last night when ordering the vegetable fajitas to find out you use butter to grill your vegetables and you put milk in your tortillas.  The waitress, who was super at her job, was only able to offer me a salad.  She said there wasn't any vegetable based oil in the kitchen to grill my vegetables.  Super frustrated for myself but the rest of the party really loved their non vegan choices and they will definitely be back.  Me, not so much."}
{"text":"Nice scenery inside, very spacious, and clean. My meals are always good here, We will go back."}
{"text":"I would give this restaurant a 5 star rating however the only down side that prevents that are the front greeting (hostess) staff. The first time there my wife and I wanted to sit near the bar. The front greeting gal told us to sit at a dirty table and wait. No way!! Second time around another greeting gal wanted to sit us at the patio and we didn't even request outdoor seating. I have to say they are kinda dumb. As we were leaving we notice a lot of empty tables, a full waiting area and the greeting gals fooling around, giggling and not seating anyone. Food is great but service is meh.. Don't think we will return unless management fires the front greeting gals!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is really nice, but that is it.  Our server took forever, I don't know if she had to many tables, but service was very slow.  The food was very bland and overall tasteless.  There are so many better alternatives in the Phoenix area, don't waste your time here."}
{"text":"Abuelo's is an expensive tex-mex chain restaurant in an area surrounded by other expensive chain restaurants.  For the price you pay, you would expect great food, right?  Wrong.  The food at Abuelo's is passable, but doesn't hold a candle to any of the other comparable restaurants in the Madison area.

The meat in my enchiladas wasn't the highest quality, but from what I saw from my companion's dishes, the quality of the ingredients didn't seem to be a problem.  It all tastes fine but is way over-priced.  The menu isn't very interesting, either.  There are a few (maybe two or three) interesting dishes but overall the menu is catered to those with unadventurous tastes.  Although you can get enchiladas filled with spinach or avocado, which is a nice touch for vegetarian diners.

The service is fine but could be better.  The last time we visited, the waiter was a young kid (probably still in high school) and he wasn't that friendly, although he was familiar with the menu and answered all of our questions.  He was attentive as well.

One final thing that irks me is the name of this place.  \"Abuelo's Mexican Food Embassy\"?  Are you kidding me?  \"Food Embassy?\"  Talk about pretentious.  Maybe if the food wasn't so lackluster, it wouldn't annoy me so much.

Abuelo's is okay but is definitely not a place you should seek out.  Even if you're in the area and looking desperately for a place to grab a bite, there are plenty of other restaurants to choose from.  Middleton has something around sixty restaurants; you shouldn't have to settle for this one.  However, if your friends are big fans of Pedro's and you want to slowly ease them up to finer Mexican cuisine, this might be your first step."}
{"text":"Abuelos is a very accommodating restaurant to families and big groups. They have amazing chimichangas and margaritas. The service is top tier."}
{"text":"Love Abuelos! Best Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Stopped in before the holidays for lunch.  It's exactly what it's supposed to be - a good chain restaurant.   Food was good and service was above average."}
{"text":"Hostess was great food was mediocre server was more content to twirl his server booklet than to fill empty drinks or get food. As soon as the bill was presented he disappeared never to reappear."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the ambiance and decor at Abuelo's! Being Hispanic, it truly reminds me of childhood memories and it feels wonderful to be in such a place. I know some people have been disappointed but each time I've been there, the food has been great and the service is also good! 

I'm not giving them 5 stars because while the food is good it's not absolutely authentic and mouth-watering. If you are looking for a nice place to take the family or your date, I would definitely recommend Abuelos! **Also their happy hour is awesome! $5 fajitas! $2 Coronas! $3 layered dip! Can't be beat!**"}
{"text":"I enjoy this place because they have happy hour 7 days a week. Great home made salsas. Every entre I have tried so far has been great. Their servers in the bar area are top notch. I would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Me and my husband decided to try the restaurant. He wanted to sit at the bar. We barely found a spot to sit due to dirty dishes being every where from previous customers. I thought maybe their really busy.  However after we ate, we saw the bartender print our check and put it in a dirty glass from a previous customer and sit it in front of us. I kept thinking that can't be our check so I asked and sure enough she confirmed that it was. I couldn't believe it.  Then I looked around and all the dirty dishes were still on the bar from all the customers that had ate their now it included ours. She was so unclean I couldn't believe it. She also was rude to other patrons in the restaurant that told her they werent happy with the drinks she made.  The food was good but I can't go back."}
{"text":"I think Abuelos is very good for a chain Mexican food restaurant. They are pretty consistent with nice servers and decent food. I remember a time when there were huge lines out the door and hour long waits, but maybe that was in spring training season because the last time I visited, we got right in with a party of 6. I will go there again with out of town guests because they seem to love it but i prefer to frequent local establishments if I can."}
{"text":"We were looking for a tex mex restaurant as we were here for vacation. None of the reviews mentioned that this is a chain similar to chilis. Our server who was very nice did not know what the special was nor what many of the items on the menu were. Food was fine but not authentic. Good for kids"}
{"text":"Friday night was a beautiful night so we wanted to go to a place with outdoor seating.  Had been to Abuelo's several times before but this was the first time we tried the outdoor seating.  WRONG!  A loud band and singer were playing in the small outdoor space that made what could have been a lovely eating experience into - let's get out of here, can't talk anyway!!!!  Why they would have a band in that small of a place so that talking was almost impossible.  Even the waiter agreed they were too loud.  Don't even remember whether the food was good or bad.  All I know is that the experience was bad!!!!

Tainted my feelings about Abuelo's."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Chandler, bar none.  I've been going since they opened and have seen their service just get better and better.  It's not the cheapest around, but I never feel like I haven't gotten a good value for my money when we visit."}
{"text":"Best Happy Hour and service..one of my fave restaurants in Az, solely based on customer service!!"}
{"text":"We were there on a busy Friday night. The atmosphere is very nice with a fun decor and good spacing of tables. After 15 minutes, husband still didn't have his margarita. The waiter said the runner must have forgotten it. Waiter ran and got it. It came in a tall, unsalted glass. This is certainly not typical of any margarita we had seen. The waiter said he would not charge us for the margarita. I only had water to drink. Sadly, the water pitcher they continually used to refill my glass had NO ice in it. It's 106 degrees outside. Ice would have been nice. Employee after employee walked by our table and ignored our empty chip basket without offering more. The waiter was sat a huge party and had three other tables at once. He just couldn't do it all. He promised more chips, more salsa, extra sides, etc. but it always took forever. Not a single dish or plate was removed from our table until we left. Our table was piled high with \"crap\" and I had to juggle the mess to get to my extra tortillas for our fajitas. We were literally out of room and plates and dishes were STACKED on top of each other. 
As waiters came by with food for other tables, they would hold the huge trays over their heads. As they walked by us, these trays would be carried over OUR HEADS. I could hear sizzling fajitas zoom over me. I was NOT happy about this. One slip up and food and sizzling hot items would have been all over us. 
Sadly, the food was great but the lack of awareness to our needs brought this experience from a five star to a two or three star. 
It was baffling as to why all of these workers were oblivious to what was obviously going on around them.    This included servers, bussers, hostesses, and what looked like management. I should have taken a picture of our table - wait you couldn't have seen any part of the table because it was BURIED in junk!!"}
{"text":"This is a restaurant we have visited several times in the past year.  This review however is in regards to last night's dining experience.  We waited a long time until our server attended to us on a busy Friday night.  But what saved the experience for us was the amazing team work they exhibited.  Two neighboring waiters took our drink order and brought us the chips and the three salsa before our waiter actually attended to us.  Our server was courteous and apologized for the wait and when he brought the check he told us that he had comped our lemonades due to the wait.  The food was consistent and it was wonderful to see the wonderful team work displayed on a hectic Friday night."}
{"text":"I think Abuelo's has a great potential to be an excellent restaurant and they just haven't figured it out how yet and I really don't know if they will someday.

It is a shame because Abuelo's is a beautiful restaurant and it has a great ambiance with that open space, high arcs, nice music, private booths and colorful decoration. They just need to work harder on their food PLEASE, I had not been there in a long time and nothing has changed, I really was expecting more. 

I always get their sautéed chicken zucchini and the last two times I had been there it has been kind of salty, today I tried a chicken enchilada with a green chile salsa and it also tasted salty, both dishes really needed a pick me up ingredient and that was acidity, I put some tomatillo salsa on them and they tasted better. They really need to make some deep reflections and make a twist on their dishes. I had a piña colada and that was nice. Service was good too."}
{"text":"Giving three starts because of the nice atmosphere with great food!  Held our office christmas party there and unfortunately, the waitress was a little off. There was about 13 of us at the table, so I guess she could be forgiven...although we're all pretty laid back. Had to flag down two other wait staff so we could get to-go boxes.  Got mine and my co-workers items mixed up when she brought the plates out, bills and change.  Laughable."}
{"text":"I'm new in town and went to celebrate my birthday dinner with my boyfriend. The micheladas were nothing special. I had some shrimp, quesadillas and poppers.  Shrimp was good but rice was stale. It was hard even after she brought a different plate. The food is bland and I wouldn't pay to eat food like this. the food is definitely over priced compared to how good it is. I'm surprised this place has good reviews and they are still in business. Sorry abuelos two thumbs way down!"}
{"text":"As I looked for a close place eat I checked to see what was on Yelp. This place had some good reviews. Other places like 5 Guys, BW, Olive Garden and Chipotle are every where back home. We went in on Sunday evening and the place was busy, but not that busy. The staff greeted us at the door and we were seat right away. The young waiter named,Robert(?), introduced himself and explained the menu plus the three sauces for the chips. He checked on us three times during the meal and kept the glasses full. As someone who waited tables all through college I understand when a waiter is on their game. 
  We have never been to Abuelo's and it was a hit with my family. One person had fajitas that came out hot and with all the trimmings. Another person had a new dish called Mi Abuelo's Majara? It was very good and cilantro lime rice was good too.  With all this said the next time we are in the area we will stop in for a bite."}
{"text":"Another wonderful meal at Abuelo's in Peoria.   Had the Monterey  (4 different enchiladas,  chili rellano,  a taco, and the house papas...potatoes ).  Add a Margherita  and a great waitress named Emily and it's the perfect meal."}
{"text":"Love their chips and salsa's, sangria swirl margaritas are delicious too! Great happy hour and service!"}
{"text":"I LOVED this restaurant - I was looking for some great Mexican before heading back East and I was so happy I chose Abuelo's!  I sat at the bar and Spike was awesome and very helpful in making recommendations.  I was there before Happy Hour ended and had a large beer and guac that was fabulous.  Then the chips are scrumptious with the three salsas....loved the chipotle fire roasted tomato - perfect kick of heat! Then the fajitas were so good I didn't want to stop eating!  The bacon wrapped shrimp and pineapple pork was amazing.  I was a happy girl at the end of the evening!!!! Upon my return to Chandler I will definitely be back!!!! YUM!!!"}
{"text":"I'd give it 5 stars but I honestly thing 5 stars and perfect scores should be reserved for a place that has achieved serious perfection. Although I do not believe Abuelos needs any improving. 
I've eaten here numerous times and love the atmosphere. I usually eat in the bar and watch a game that's on. I eat here every couple weeks, every staff member is friendly and attentive, even if they are not waitstaff they always smile back at me and say hello. 
The food has been absolutely delicious every time. 
I have read a lot of reviews about Abuelos and even though some people are claiming they have had Mexican food and understand the flavor I really do not think they do. I grew up eating Mexican food home-cooked by friends of the family that I spent summers with. Hand making corn tortillas and tamales.  Eating at Abuelos is like eating the food Mrs. Artiaga made for me growing up. It makes me feel home again. There's nothing better than that. 

I've also never been anywhere in Wisconsin that cooks shrimp as perfectly as Abuelos. Wisconsin doesn't know seafood like my old homes of Maine and Seattle, Washington.  The steak I had in my fajitas was cooked and seasoned perfectly too. 
Pork tacos are delicious.  
My favorite drink is the hand shaken margarita. Seriously the best I've ever had, and I got a lot more that I expected. 
This is in my top 3 favorite restaurants in Wisconsin... And I'm astounded it's a chain. 
Haters gunna hate. That's just what they do. 
But I love Abuelos."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night and overall it was poor. Let me some it up this way:
1. Had to move booths because the first booth and seats were so spread apart we had to literally sit at the edge of  our seats to reach the table.
2. Decor/ style was over indulgent for a Mexican restaurant and reminded me of a cheap version of the Venetian hotel in Vegas. Very tacky.
3. If you are looking for a cool, hip restaurant this isn't it. 
4. Margarita was good but gone after just a few drinks.  For $10 I expected a bit more grande than what I got.
5. Jalapeño fritters were the best thing I ate. They we're served warm. Asked server if I could get hot ones and he replied somewhat annoyed and confused \" do you want me to throw them back in the fryer?\"  Enough said there. (The manager did return with hot ones and did not charge us for the item.)
6. Yes, they have 3 types of salsa....and that's about it.  The green one is just plain offensive. Not sure how that one found its way into a so called authentic Mexican restaurant. It was also very challenging to scoop out salsa from the small tin bowls when they come about a 1/4 full.
7. Ordered fajitas. Let's see...flavorless and waaaay overlooked. Just plain bad! 
Not sure what people like so much about this food. I'd rather go to Chipotle."}
{"text":"Chips are thin. Food is expensive and not much. Asked for no tomato, onions, mushrooms- got tomato and peppers( not listed on menu) won't return. Husband complained of not many fixings. On to another restaurant"}
{"text":"Service was great. Food was good, but for the same thing I can pay half the price at filibertos."}
{"text":"First of all the salsa dip trays are a total joke. They are baby size. Hardly any room for salsa. To add to that, the chips are super thin and lack salt & flavor. Okay so I was looking at the menu and I decided to order a classic chimichanga Mexican dish. It looked good because generally the pictures are to display the quality of the food. I was totally wrong! When I received my chimichanga it was so small! I asked for beef which usually comes shredded, but it came out in chunk sizes and it tasted smoked and uncooked. Lastly, they used nacho cheese instead of regular sprinkled cheese to go along with the beef. Very disappointed in such a fancy looking place :("}
{"text":"Awesome food, for decent price. Went with my wife an kids. Server was nice . Host tho seem to hate there life's an jobs  when she seated are family she didn't offer my kids buster chairs more asked me if I needed a highchair as I stood there with a one year old."}
{"text":"I don't like leaving bad reviews, but this place is getting one. 

I'd see this place along Chandler Blvd, I was told by a coworker it was her \"favorite place to go - best Mexican she ever had\". She may have been an idiot and I may have had high expectations, but I expected SOMETHING edible. 

The chips & salsa were mediocre at  best, probably not even that. 

Beer was ok I guess - got a pitcher. 

But the food was horrendous. 

The tasteless things we got were just a joke - NOTHING seemed to have much flavor or quality. 

Our server was relatively hapless.. I'd NEVER go back. 

Even Arriba further down Chandler Blvd is much better than this. 

Skip it."}
{"text":"The food, service, and hospitality were all top-notch. I had the rib-eye and enchiladas dinner and am really close to slipping into a [glorious] food coma. Ask for José as your server, he's found the elusive medium of being extremely attentive without being overbearing.

Update: Best flan I've ever had in my life!"}
{"text":"We arrived around 7 PM on a very busy Saturday night with our visiting granddaughters and were seated in about twenty minutes.  I told the hostess we would take the first available table and we were seated on the enclosed patio.  I would not do that again as the atmosphere is not pleasant, harsh lighting and no decor.  The food was very good and the portions were very large.  Our server was very attentive and friendly.  A good place to take out of town visitors."}
{"text":"It's hard for me to believe this, but finding a good Mexican restaurant in Arizona isn't as easy as I thought it would be when I moved here.   Abuelo's is one of the best places I have eaten Mexican at.   It is a little more expensive but I find it to be reasonable for the amount of food you get as well as the selection and taste.   They have a very good sized menu and offer a number of variations."}
{"text":"More than decent \"upscale\" Mexican restaurant in Peoria. Definitely the best of the lot in the neighborhood--compared to Cheesecake Factory and PF Changs. 

Miss C just got back in town so we were doing a girls catch up +1. 

Decor: Open indoor courtyard makes you feel like you're in someone's hacienda. Didn't feel like Peoria at all. 

Food: We all really liked that we multiple baskets of chips and salsa for the table. The chips were warm, light, and crisp. The salsa was fresh and not too chunky or saucy. I had the fajita beef salad, Miss C had the chile con queso, E had another salad, P had the shrimp fajitas, and L had some kind of grilled beef. Everyone enjoyed their meals, I thought the honey lime dressing for the salad was particularly yummy especially during the summer. P thought his shrimp were overseasoned. 

Service: !Que terrible!  I actually regret tipping that waiter. First of all, he was not attentive and although we were waiting for another person to show up, did not ask us if we wanted to go ahead an order or suggest any type of appetizer. In addition, L can only eat gluten-free foods so we asked him if there were any menu times that came gluten-free.  He said that she would have to choose a protein based dish and pick out the food with glutens!! He was very insensitive and unresponsive to this very specific and very important request.  Little did we know that L had called Abuelo's directly and spoke to the manager about her diet. The mgr replied that the restaurant has a gluten-free menu!  We asked the waiter to bring the mgr over so she could give him her order. The waiter was such an ASS."}
{"text":"I always enjoy this restaurant and the food is great!  It comes out fresh, hot, and plentiful.  The review related to sitting in the bar area is correct - do not sit there as the service is horrible.  It appears they prefer to sit small parties in that section but just decline it and you will be seated in the regular dining area.  Every time I go, the servers are polite and friendly, including the table cleaners.  Nacho is one of them that always has a smile and enjoys the interaction with Customers.  Friday and Saturday nights are extremely busy and waits can be long."}
{"text":"Our favorite Mexican restaurant. Very good food and the service is always excellent. There always seems to be a manager on the floor walking around asking all the tables if everything is good which I rarely see in any other establishment. The interior of the building is beautiful as well."}
{"text":"It's good. Their portions are a little small, and their service is ok. They are very slow in getting your waters and chips. If you want a refill, you have to ask. We like the food, but the service could be better."}
{"text":"Such a shame!!!  We have been dining at Abuelos for over 3 years now and the service and food has always been incredible.  My wife and I frequented Abuelos a few years ago for the great happy hour and incredible service by one of the bartenders i believe his name was john.  We would walk in and instantly he would have our drinks and greet us with a smile and small talk.  Unfortunately he's been gone for some time now and since leaving, the bar service is less than average.  We are very low maintenance and simple to please but for some reason it feels like we're a burden on the staff now.  Occasionally we will ask where John went and the guy that worked with him for years will shrug and say he doesn't know but his reaction is always strange.  We used to love Abuelos but now we are simply displeased with the service and the lack of friendly comfort we used to feel.  They should find john and bring him back if they want to succeed!"}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed ,service was slow and food was pretty much flavorless. The building however is impressive."}
{"text":"Wahrscheinlich wird man mit der Zeit kritischer. Aber dieses Restaurant ist dann doch Durchschnitt. Schmeckt, aber wird nicht in Erinnerung bleiben. Sieht von außen toll aus, innen kann der Eindruck nicht mehr ganz mithalten. Einheitslook. Die Karte auch. Aber es hat geschmeckt. Kann man also hingehen, macht nichts falsch aber das gilt für die anderen Restaurants in der Umgebung wohl auch."}
{"text":"Horrible service and food. Don't waste your time and money. There are better mexican restaurants to try. Our waiter was unattentive and barely visted the table. We resorted to using the service button on the monitor since our waiter couldn't see our gestures to wave him down. The food was terrible and lacked flavor and texture! Don't order the avocado or spinach enchiladas. Unless you are okay with a thin crepe-like texture stuffed with guacamole or spinach paste! Not once did I chew my food! Unfortunately, I was unable to finish my food. This is coming from someone who dislikes wasting food. 
The hosts at the front need to be further trained in customer service and greeting incoming/outgoing customers."}
{"text":"Ate there with the wife last night. Everything tasted to us like it was straight out of a can and came to the table cold. Server was nice, but the everything home made speech is a crock. Just because it was put in a pot, then from a pot to a plate does not mean it should be called homemade or hand made."}
{"text":"Very disappointing experience.    Place was empty on a Saturday night at 8 pm.  Chips and salsas were very good.  Drinks were nothing special and the house margarita was quite sweet. Decor was dusty and dirty in the bar.  Our dinners were exceptionally salty on all fronts.  The grilled pork was inedible due to over salting.   The beef was well cooked but also very salty.    Disappointed and we will not be coming back here. The video games at the table are a distraction and should be done away with.  Our server was very nice and did a good job waiting on us.  This place is trying to be the Olive Garden of Mexican food and it shows."}
{"text":"I went in with a friend for lunch. As soon as we sat down, the server immediately came to greet us and asked for drink orders. Once we ordered our food, the meals got to our table extremely fast! We both got the chicken zucchini lunch plate, which was pretty good. Our server checked in on us often, and never let our drinks get more than half way empty before refilling them. 

In summary, great service, decent food, I would go back."}
{"text":"Free tortilla chips and salsa are the best part. The margaritas are about average and the enchilladas are ok. The price is right and the decor is good but I've had better."}
{"text":"One of the best Mexican places I have had! I got the 3 choice enchiladas- the pork, chicken, and avocado were awesome. Bonus- their mashed potatoes are bomb too. Our service was incredible which made it 100x better. Juan was such a great server & was on top of his A game- attentiveness to us without hovering. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Great food, excellent service,& the flan is really smooth & creamy. The Los Muheras is awesome. Very happy customers!"}
{"text":"The jalapeño cheese fritters are a tasty start! Try the sautéed chicken and zucchini for dinner. It's delicious and doesn't leave you feeling overly stuffed."}
{"text":"As a general rule, I steer clear of chain restaurants across from shopping malls, but I must admit, this place has got some seriously delicious seafood. I recommend the Pescado Guerrero - a wood-grilled tender mahi-mahi steak with fresh shrimp, scallops, mushrooms, spinach, roasted peppers and sliced avocado in a white wine sauce. Yes, I totally stole that description from their website, although I did remove the word 'delicious', since I'd already used it in the previous sentence. Thought it might sound a little too repetitive if I left it in, two deliciouses so close together. Not that this dish doesn't deserve 'em both, it's just that I'm not one to repeat things unnecessarily. Omit needless words, that's what Strunk & White would say. Sharp guys. Not big Yelpers, from what I understand, but still good advice nevertheless... Although, used correctly, repetition can be an excellent rhetorical strategy for producing emphasis, clarity, amplification, even emotional effect. I guess Joe Walsh was right, there are two side to every story.

Oh, and I'd stay away from the Fundido del Mar appetizer. A little too much fondue and not enough shrimp & scallops."}
{"text":"We liked the chips and salsa. There was 6 of us for dinner and it was good. Service is good and very helpful. Our favorite is the enchiladas since the choices are plentiful and delicious. We definitely will come back here."}
{"text":"I recently went to Abuelos with my wife for a date night before hitting the movies across the street. We were seated promptly. 

I enjoyed my 4 enchilada plate. I've never had an avocado enchilada before.  I mixed up the other enchiladas with pork and beef with various sauces on top. The beans and rice were good and reminded me of what I'm used to in certain place ins California. 

My wife had steak/shrimp fajitas. She enjoyed her meal. The only complain was the small amount of cheese, sour cream, etc that comes with the plate.  The steak was juice and tender and the shrimp was cooked nicely.

Our food came out quickly, as we ordered and hot.

The server was attentive.to our need, refills and also returned the check in a timely manner 

Was this the best mexican fare I've had, no, but I definitely think the food is above average.

The inside wasn't what I normally think of at a Mexican place. Had a nice ambiance and atmosphere that I've grown accustomed to at most mexican places I've gone to throughout the US.

Overall, I was happy with the meal and experience and will be back again."}
{"text":"Went back for another visit with my in laws. Even less impressed this time. Don't waste your time at this dump."}
{"text":"Great ambiance! Sky painted high ceiling, great decor, music etc. I ordered beaf Chimichangas but they messed the order and brought in something else (still have no clue what it was). Waiter and manager apologized and I ordered again. After a while I got my meal and it was absolutely delicious - tender beef, spices just right, great veggies etc. The only thing my husband had already finished his meal. Besides the tip, we didn't need to pay for any of our meals.  Thank you for great customer service!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour! Great food ! Great drinks! Only one complaint.... They had the air on too high! But all in all a great experience!
Our waitress was great and I'm sure if I would have mentioned the air being too high, they would have lowered it. We will definitely return!!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding! Again! Loved the drink, the appetizers, food and drink! My enchiladas were great, the combo is the way to go! Our server Jose did a great job with a large party with lots of substitutions. Only wish there was one closer."}
{"text":"I moved to the area from Texas where there was an Abuelo's. I was happy to find out there was a location near me here in Arizona. Everything tastes the same compared to back home and great!"}
{"text":"Delicious and fresh ingredients from the chips and salsa, to the margarita's as well as the main course! If the tastes of Mexico are on your mind the. There is only one choice! My new favorite Mexican Restaurant!"}
{"text":"The most horrible restaurant I've been to!  Tyson chicken fingers for kids food, boxed taco shells for tacos, bad service....I might as well have gone to a fast food restaurant and paid less! At least I'd known what to expect!"}
{"text":"Oh my heavens!!! I cannot believe i have been passing this place on the 101 for years now and have only just discovered how delicious it is! I had the Hidalgo special. It was a chili relleno and enchilada with beans and papas. So. So. Yummy!! Each thing i ate blew my mind! You've got to love a place that serves free chips and salsa while you wait. I cannot wait to return!"}
{"text":"Incredible food - never disappointed. Drinks are pricy - and service was pushy about ordering more drinks - but the food is well worth every penny"}
{"text":"The food here is delicious and the Sangria swirls are a must. My husband and I don't mind the drive from Scottsdale because it never disappoints. My favorite is there red sauce enchiladas and their papas..yummmyyyy :)"}
{"text":"Horrible!!!!  Not even worth one star!  Wanted a shredded beef chimi but they do not have one on the menu.  Placed my order, the waitress departed, so figured it was an easy solution to ask them to \"lightly fry\" the shredded beef burro...they must have the ability since other entrees are \"lightly fried\".  Couldn't help but see the manager coming towards our table as she seemed quite on a mission.  It was no surprise, as she braced herself against the back of my seat in the booth, and quipped....\"I understand you can't find what you want on our menu\".   Harsh...very harsh.   I explained what I wanted.  She said they couldn't do it.  Appalled at the Manager-with-an-attitude who is definitely in the wrong job....rude, abrupt.  I had no other choice as she towered over waiting for me to make a selection, to order the ground beef and cheese burrito which was lightly fried.  When my dinner arrived at the table, it was a pathetic 4\" by 4\" heavily fried 1/2\" thick (flat) something with MAYBE two tablespoons of ground beef in it.  Don't go there....too many other places nearby that offer quality, choices, pleasant staff, and value."}
{"text":"My second time here and I have to say its one of my favorites. Had the ribeye and enchiladas everything was delicious, perfect dinner."}
{"text":"No good if it wasn't for our waiter being so nice I would of walked out!! Food was not good and not sure even close to mexican food!! Won't be going there ever again!!!!"}
{"text":"Have to say their service was great. No complaints there but the food on the other had was not Mexican and authentic like they so describe it. This is what you call Tex-Mex \"Americanized\" Mexican food. I was hoping some good authentic spicy salsas and some tasty mole and sadly they disappointed. Wouldnt come back. This is like that once place you see all time and go just to experience it once but not come back again."}
{"text":"This place is over priced and not very good. Why would you pay those prices for pretentious Mexican food? Filburto's is better tasting and better priced. The decor is nice, but I prefer good food."}
{"text":"Minus the complimentary salsa trio (quartet, if you count the hot sauce), I'd probably knock Abuelo's down half a star, but I LOVED all of the salsas and our waiter was fantastic. We took a lonnng lunch and ordered the appetizer sampler of dips (all of which were fantastic) and shared a steak and shrimp fajitas for ONE. When the food came to the table I was shocked that the entree portion was truly intended for ONE. Needless to say, we stuffed ourselves, enjoyed a couple adult bevs and still left with two boxes of leftovers. 

If we weren't sharing, I think the food would be a bit overpriced (especially for lunch), but it was a nice change and I'll be back."}
{"text":"We had an awesome meal at Abuelo's last week thanks to Larry and Rachel Ott, dear friends who gave us a certificate. They say it is their own favorite. I loved mi chimichanga but the only change I will make next time is to ask them not to cut it. All very flavorful and fresh.
Will definitely return"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is nice but everything else was subpar.  Guacamole tasted like it came out a bag, even though they claim it's made fresh. It was terrible! Gross"}
{"text":"I have been going here since they opened in Chandler.  I used to love this restaurant specifically for their grilled chicken salad.  Over the years this particular salad has gone downhill.  I even asked the manager if they changed the recipe and he said no. It used to be filled with wonderful ingredients and now it looks like they opened a bag of pre-cut lettuce and dumped it on a plate with hardly any other veggies.  I also enjoyed the salsa they used to serve a while ago.  Now they have 3 different salsas brought out and none of them match the quality of the original salsa."}
{"text":"Great Gringo Mexican food, very good for taking Midwestern visitors. Not too spicy for them."}
{"text":"We just finished eating lunch,  and we really enjoyed every thing that we ordered.  We had one of the best waiters in any local restaurant.  Kyle did a fantastic job and was very polite and professional! We haven't been here in a couple of years, and we will be making this restaurant one on our regular places to dine."}
{"text":"I'm sitting at the bar in Firebirds enjoying dinner because I couldn't get any service at the bar at Aubelo's.  Sat at Aubelo's bar for over five minutes, never even being acknowledged by bartender.  Dirty dishes and payment receipts littered the bar in front of me.  What is so hard about saying, \"I'll be with you in a moment, sir,\"???  Geez"}
{"text":"Good overall experience overall.  Unlike other comments, our services were excellent and food was above average.  Excellent margaritas!"}
{"text":"Just came back from my first dining experience here, and it could not have been better.  Jon was our server and he was about as friendly and attentive as he could be.  My eldest son has always shied away from Mexican food, but he agreed to go tonight.  He ordered the chicken fajitas and gave it a thumbs up.  Thumbs up from him and me on the margaritas as well.  My youngest and I both had the Grande Burrito and we loved it.  We will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing. We have much better Mexican food in Seattle.  I felt like I was in an old refurbished El Torito's (was I?) that is now the Cheesecake factory of Mexican food with the huge portions.  Did like the pico de gallo and fajitas were fine..  I will likely give this place another try because I want to find out more about their specialty dishes.  I wanted to like this place more. Just disappointed."}
{"text":"Stopped in at abuelos after working up a serious appetite shopping at arrowhead mall. What a work out carrying all these bags. I started off with a shrimp cocktail then my entree was the Monterey, that plate was a beast. From the chips and salsa to the entree I couldn't have happier. Our Server Jose was also attentive and made dining there a pleasure. The enchiladas and taco were delicious, I liked the different enchiladas that were served. Variety is always nice. The chips were light and crispy and the salsas were flavorful as well as spicy. We'll definitely come back to the place."}
{"text":"My husband and I went on a date night and we wanted to try this restaurant because we have heard its really good. We got there, we waited about 20 minutes for a table. Our \"server\" comes around, asked us what we want to drink and brings our drinks to table. He didn't introduced himself, not an hello, he didn't mention what specials they have, absolutely nothing. We said, we have never been here before and we have no idea what's good. He said \"look over the menu and if you have questions let me know\". By the time the word question came out of his mouth, he turned around and left from our table. My husband and I looked at each other and didn't know what to do. We got up and left, we didn't want our date night to be ruined by someone that has a bad attitude or doesn't care about the customer. I'm not rating the food, because I didn't get to experience that but I'm rating the server. Bad impression."}
{"text":"Abuelo's the Applebees of mexican fare!

Somebody on here said \"The best mexican restaurant I have ever been to\".  I'm guessing he was stoned when he ate here.. First off it is a chain.  The location is in an area of Cleveland that is getting more \"diverse\" by the day. The majority of the food is microwaved or cooked hours before service.  As a fellow reviewer has already stated the chips are so thin trying to dip them in salsa is near impossible due to breaking.
  
When Abeulos first opened it did have some potential. All of  the good servers have moved on and a new breed of lazy,dirty, and sweaty inmates have moved in.  Not trying to be mean, but the last server was sweating so much it grossed our table out.  Want some extra hot sauce?  Ill just drip sweat in your food!  Just dont go here."}
{"text":"Been coming here for a couple of years. The stuffed chile rellenos and papas are awesome. We totally dig the happy hour as well. Dos XX amber on draft, chilled mugs, good eats---until 7:00!"}
{"text":"Really cool looking place, but all of the creativity is in the design of the building and it doesn't seem like any is put into the food.  Hit a street taco vendor instead."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Abuelos several times and I've enjoyed their food everytime. The first thing that I like about Abuelos is that it doesn't look like your typical Mexican Restaurant. I hate it when they over exaggerate the Mexican theme. Abuelos does it right with a courtyard feel ambiance. 

The food is amazing. They have one of the best beef fajitas I have ever tasted. They also have various flavors of enchiladas that are very good.

Depending on time of day, you will experience a wait time to get a table which means there will be a wait time for your food. Don't worry, they provide chips and salsa and they are good. The food is definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"Hands down one of mine and my family's favorite places! We visit often, and every time the staff is amazing! Very friendly. I would come here just for the spinach enchiladas and the Espinaca casserole alone, if you like spinach, these are a must!"}
{"text":"The website on google and yelp both showed that the restaurant was open until 11pm. My husband and I drove from Akron to come to this restaurant and meet friends. When we arrived (~945) we discovered that the restaurant was already closed. I called the restaurant and they stated that they were aware of the google and yelp time error and said that the websites have been incorrect for about a year."}
{"text":"Man! I use to love this place!!!! Tonight was the worst service I've ever had here- almost felt forgotten about! Server didn't hear part of my order and I ended up getting my soup after my meal. The main dish was satisfactory...  While waiting for my bill, my teenage son fell asleep- that's how long we waited! 
There are many other restaurants in the area- go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Food is excellent.  A wide option to choose from.  Our waitress Kelly was the best waitress you could ask for.  The hostesses were very nice.  I will return here again and again"}
{"text":"Enjoy the atmosphere here and the delicious authentic food. It's quiet and we get excellent service.  But this time our service was very poor. They forgot our appetizer. They brought me a dish I didn't order. So this trip was a disappointment."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went out for date night here recently and really enjoyed the food and service. I have a difficult time paying high dollar for Mexican food because there is such an abundance of authentic Mexican restaurants around the valley, but this place is a bit more upscale and the drink selection is extensive. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Did not have a pleasant experience.  They were not even busy and it took about 45 minutes to get our dinner.  When we did receive our dinners one of them was wrong.  Took another 15 minutes to receive the correct dinner.  The food itself was excellent.  Service was absolutely lousy."}
{"text":"Great happy hour and great staff. Nina made us feel like family with our 1 yr old daughter. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"We love Mexican Food... and this place never disappoints. Particularly, the margarita's are the best if all Mexican restaurants in the East Valley area¡"}
{"text":"First off, i've never met a person, let alone hostess, so depressing, rude, and not helping.  We politely said hello and asked for a booth, she looked at us like we were from Mars, and didn't say a word.  Whispered something to another girl, who sat us, without a word.

The only reason this restaurant is getting 1 star, is because of the delicious cheesecake dessert and cup of coffee, awesome! Also, the ambiance is fantastic, fabulous idea with the cloud ceiling.

Our server, Brittany, was rude, impatient, short, and the least bit helpful.  The only reason I know her name is because I heard her greet another table next to ours.  She didn't check on us more than once, the very polite busser lady took better care of us!  

The food was NOT traditional, completely chainy, heavy, and full of oil.  I guess i'm just spoiled with good Mexican food from where I live...

The salsa tasted, (and looked), like tomato paste.  The chips were light and delicious though.  

Basically, there is a reason the other Abuelo's have closed."}
{"text":"This place was disgusting. I had one of the \"feasts\" and I have been gagging ever since we left. This is the first review I have done because I want to save people from going here. I would literally rather put something from my trash can in my mouth before paying 70 bucks for the microwaved food they served us. If I could have put zero stars I would have but Yelp wouldn't let me."}
{"text":"The boyfriend was in the mood for Mexican and really wanted to eat here since I always  adamantly say no. I've eaten at the one in Scottsdale a few times (years ago) and wasn't impressed, so I had no desire to try this location. However it was his turn to choose so Abuelo's it was. 

We arrived and approached the empty hostess counter. The sign said please wait to be seated. So we waited, and waited. Peaked our head's around and saw servers attending tables and waitresses chatting up the bartender. We started to peruse the menu and after a while the bartender came over and took us to a booth. I could see him also craning his neck looking for the missing hostess. 

Our waitress was very nice and kept our glasses refilled. She brought a trio of salsas and chips to the table. They were fine. Jarred salsa. Except the green one. I think it had pineapple juice in it. I instantly wanted to gag and shoved it to the far end of the table. We ordered the chicken and spinach mini chimis as an appetizer. When they arrived I was rather confused as to why there was tomatoes and corn in it. The cilantro aioli was orange and I couldn't find any cilantro. I know the server keyed in the correct item as it showed on the bill, however I would never have ordered them had I known that chicken and spinach meant chicken and corn salsa. 

For an entree I ordered the new green chili pork burrito with refried beans and the mashed potatoes. My boyfriend ordered the Juarez which is a beef taco, beef tamale, chicken enchilada, and a cheese enchilada also with beans and potatoes. 

At the end of our meal the only thing to disappear from our plates was the potatoes. The refried beans are apparently cooked in bacon grease. Neither of us ate them. Other than the cheese enchilada everything was really dry and flavorless. It's pretty embarrassing I would think to run a Mexican restaurant and your best menu item is mashed potatoes. The only reason I'm giving one star is for our friendly waitress. 

Abuelo's you have forever been crossed off the list."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the food, should have went to chipotle across the street. The salsa dishes are thimble size."}
{"text":"Great Service, great food.  Definitely my favorite Mexican restaurant in the valley"}
{"text":"1st visit in quite a while and I wonder why we haven't been there recently - food was awesome - loved the chips - not heavy at all - salsas were great - 3 types.  I had the grande burrito and my husband had 3 enchiladas - carnitas, shredded beef and chicken - came with beans and rice.  Plenty of food and reasonable price.  Server was great - attentive without hovering.  My glass was always refilled before I had finished it.  Brought us additional chips and salsa - again without asking.  All in all a wonderful visit - will return soon :-)"}
{"text":"Went there for my neices graduation last week. There were twelve of us and everyone had something different. The chicken fajitas were great and I heard no complaints from anyone. The sangria and margaritas went down pretty easy as well."}
{"text":"Food was basic at best. Queso was not my favorite and the margarita was much too sugary.Service was slow. Happy hour specials weren't all that great. On the plus side, we had the balcony to ourselves and they turned on the curtain of cool for us."}
{"text":"The decor here is pretty neat...I like that a lot. 

I would describe the service as attentive. I felt bad for our waiter, though....I think he was new. he brought us our chips/dip and then 5 minutes later brought another one. He saw the one on our table, and commented on how someone must've beaten him to it (he was being serious). haha!! He had a few other issues too....but a really nice person and very attentive - he tried hard.

The reason for the 3 stars is the food - it was average at best. I thought the relleno was okay, but the enchiladas and tamales were bland. We had cabernet - it was not very good... You know your taste buds are in for a treat when you order a wine that is served in a bottle with a screw top, right?.... their wine menu could use an overhaul, in my opinion.

BUT... i recognize that it is a Mexican restaurant and wine is not the specialty.

We probably won't go back...there are much tastier places in the same area."}
{"text":"excellent service, very nice décor, Tex-Mex"}
{"text":"Abuelo's has no need to apologize for being a chain.  So what?  

From beginning to end, Abuelo's has quality ingredients and preparation.  

The drink menu has every variation on a theme you could desire, and the bar action is lively and bright. The trio of complimentary salsas are superb.  The menu is varied and goes beyond the typical Tex-Mex or just Mex offerings.  All four of us enjoyed our entrees and the chocolate dessert.

We prefer sitting in the bar area; the lighting is better and you don't have the creepy murals staring you in the face.  

A nice stop on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"We had been to Abuelos tonight to enjoy family time and a nice meal.  Sadly my son accidently burned his hand on the fajitas plate right after it was set down on the table.  We ended up having to get the food to go as he couldn't stop crying and we needed to get to a pharmacy. I want to personally thank Rodolfo the server and Jessica the manager, for bending over backwards to try to make sure our son was as comfortable as possible.  It truly set you apart tonight and we won't forget your kindness.  We will come back,  and be more careful .  Thank you Abuelos."}
{"text":"Pulled in at 6:40 pm to a nearly full parking lot...Walked into no one waiting to get a table, but almost every seat in the restaurant and bar filled. We looked over to find two seats available at the bar, and quickly said we'll take them. We were immediately welcomed, even as we were still putting our coats down, and offered drinks, chips and salsa from the bartender. For the rest of our dinner, we were perfectly attended to and chatted up by the two bartenders managing the bar and restaurant orders that evening. I'd never been to Abuelo's before and asked our female bartender more questions than I usually do at any restaurant, (not sure why on this one night) and she was exceedingly helpful, cheerful and didn't appear agitated as I inquired about all their different sauce options I could layer on top of my burrito. She ended up bringing me two sides, and I decided I loved the chile con queso...When I was low on that...she brought an add'l serving. Happy hour is until 7...so we made it under the wire, they had $3 off most of their signature margaritas - many with hand squeezed fresh lime juice. Even though we sat directly at the bar, the seating adjacent to the bar looked like comfortable spots for two to enjoy the scene and were strategically lit with direct lighting from above I noticed, so people could easily read their menus."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to go to Abuelo's for dinner on our first wedding anniversary this past weekend, because we wanted Mexican food in a classy setting. For this purpose, Abuelo's was a good pick. Even though we had been there before to watch a football game in the bar area, there is good separation between the bar and the dining room. The dining room itself is classy, with great artwork and Mexican architecture. In many of the Mexican restaurants I've visited, the feeling is a bit more cave-like; Abuelo's, however, has a very open feel with good lighting and a vaulted ceiling. 

Service was extremely friendly. We loved our server, Patience, who gave us plenty of time to enjoy ourselves and our meal. Food came quick and was delicious. 

The price was surprisingly affordable. Our meal included two drinks, appetizer, main dish, and dessert for a total of $43. We were shocked, but pleased! Of course, we tipped Patience bigtime. She deserved it.

If you want an authentic Mexican restaurant feel, Abuelo's is probably NOT the place. Overall, a good spot. I'm sure we'll go back many more times."}
{"text":"I have never, ever had a bad experience here....the food is fabulous (I'm partial to the Avocado Enchiladas) and the margaitas are the best.  I've never had anything less than excellent service.  I wish they were closer to me!!!"}
{"text":"I have been to this place twice. The first time I went I got a pasta dish that was just okay, and my husband berated me because I got an Italian dish at a Mexican restaurant. We were invited to go back, and I kept my options open and decided to try the lunch meal 1/2 chicken quesadilla with rice and beans. For one, it was hardly a quesadilla... it had no cheese in it but the cheese was melted on top of the tortilla. I took 4 bites and on my fourth bite I got 3 hard pieces in my mouth, and found out after spitting it out, that they were chicken bones. I was thoroughly disgusted. The food is terrible, and it's overpriced. Definitely won't waste my money there again."}
{"text":"At first appearance the place looks awesome.
Quick and prompt service.  Our salsa bowls were constantly refilled by the server assistants.
Then came the food....We were thereforSunday lunch and ordered off the lunch menu.  I ordered the enchilada and tostada which was quite the deal.  My wife ordered the lunch fajitas.  The flavor was good and enjoyable.   We will be back for happy hour!"}
{"text":"What a disappointment.....hostess at front seemed to be in a bad mood and didn't even smile. Server was great. I tried one of the featured margaritas on menu and it was terrible, it did not even resemble the picture. My girlfriend ordered the shredded beef tacos, I could not even look at her plate because it reminded me of canned dog food. She said it tasted like beef stew in a tortilla...and the \"papas\" that came with it were we think mashed potatoes with cheese on top. I ordered a enchilada and a relleno...sauce tasted like taco bell and the relleno was a was bland even covered with salsa and stuffed with processed cheese product...it was a waste of $50!"}
{"text":"Not your average Mexican.  This has a variety of dishes you wouldn't find elsewhere.  Absolutely delicious.  Service is outstanding and very accommodating.  I'm there at least 3x's/week."}
{"text":"Our meal was awesome we discover this great place about 4 years ago and keep coming back the food is great the people are fantastic willing to do what ever it takes to have you enjoy your meal. We had the fajitas and the tortilla soup it was a great."}
{"text":"It's painful for me to read all these reviews because in the fifty times I have been to Abuelo's (in three different states, actually), I have NEVER had an experience like the one they describe.  The employees have always been friendly, and even though we have lots of special requests (little ice, tons of refills, specific numbers of different salsas, customized orders), they always comply with a good attitude.  If we ever have any problems, they quickly and cheerfully fix them (even if it was my fault) and never seem put out at all. I also enjoy the upbeat ambiance of the place.

The chips are the super thin kind, and are deliciously crispy and crunchy.. my absolute favorite restaurant chips of all time.  The salsas are great as well.  The traditional red salsa is the best, and the super spicy one (it comes in a smaller cup on the side) has the best flavor, which makes it hard to eat in moderation!  Be sure you have water handy to cool it down.  As for the entrees, the enchilada meals are always fantastic.  My parents have never gotten anything else, as they enjoy them so much every time.  Try as many combinations as possible; I have never been disappointed.  As for me, I am in love with the chile rellenos, chimichangas, tacos, and most recently, the fajitas.  As for sides, the refried beans are amazing, and the rice is always good.  The papas con chile (mashed potatoes) are fantastic (definitely try those!) and the spinach casserole-type side is creamy and yummy too!  The charro beans are cooked with bacon and have a wonderful savory flavor as well.  Something that I've noticed in other Abuelo's reviews was a complaint about a \"film over the refried beans\".  This is because the kitchen prepares the food, then puts the whole plate into the oven to finish, so the plate and food are both steaming hot, which I love.

The portions are huge and you will never leave hungry.  To finish off the meal, you get some delicious butter mints.  While I agree it is rather expensive, if you join the e-club, you do get some pretty good coupons, and are alerted of any upcoming deals.  I'm not sure if the Cleveland Costco has this deal, but back in Wisconsin, they sell $100 Abuelo's gift cards for $80 (a 20% saving), which we would always purchase ahead of time and save some money right there!

Like I said, I love it.  We go there for every special occasion, hands down, and it is my absolute favorite."}
{"text":"This place as just ok... I expected far too much from this place.  Guacomole should NEVER contain mostly sour cream... such an easy thing to make.  Calling it a dip does not excuse this!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! I love to sit at the bar and order nachos or enchiladas and hang out with my husband. The service and food are good."}
{"text":"I certainly cannot weave a tale like Nick.  However we have been coming here for some time so I thought I should write something.  

Service

First, never had bad service...never...That's difficult to pull off.  Yes it is a chain, but you really wouldn't know it.  

Today, we had an exceptionally great server Emily (don't know if that's how she spells it).  But she answered all of our questions and actually had opinions on what she liked and why.  

Food
Yes, the food here can be sporadic.  But it is never bad.  It is not always consistent. For example, sometimes you get a lot of chicken in your enchilada and sometimes you have to hunt for it.  

Today, as usual we both had enchilada combos.  Don't judge, we like them.  Wife and I tried two new enchiladas.  

I had the spinach enchilada.  I will be getting them again...and probably again.  Wife had the avocado enchilada.  We both liked the spinach (yes we shared) and she liked the avocado.  I hated it.  But I hate guacamole so it made sense I wouldn't like it. 

Wife also tried the pork enchiladas.  I think she liked them because I never saw one of them. 

If you like cheesy mashed potatoes and don't care about calories and fat because you are eating out, then you would be remiss not to enjoy their greatness.  

And of course...charro beans please. 

Summary
We like it here, warm friendly atmosphere.  They wait to make fun of you until you leave when you put a greedy amount of mints located at the front desk in your bag."}
{"text":"This is a great family restaurant. If you are looking for flavorful food and excellent service this is the place for you! This is our second time at this location and we had such an excellent experience that I had to write about it. We were sat in Jose's section . Now only did this guy know his menu but his service was amazing .. notified us of the specialists throughout the week . Delivered our food and drinks in a timely fashion which is key since we had our busy body toddler with us. Will be recommending this place to our friends and family and will tell them to ask for Jose's section."}
{"text":"My husband and I had lunch here last weekend. We were both very impressed. Our waiter went out of his way to suggest options that we both loved. The food was very good - not your typical AZ Mexican food, but a little more modern. We will definitely return - we loved the ambiance!"}
{"text":"FOOD/DRINKS - good!

Appetizer - Nachos Classic ( ~$7)
Originally ordered the Nachos Grande, but received the Nachos Classic instead.  The manager somehow knew we received the wrong dish, offered to re-make the correct dish, and took it off the bill. Since my date and I were first-timers here, we had no idea that we received the wrong dish, but we stuck with the Nachos Classic. It was very nice of her to take it off our bill. The nachos classic tasted very good, however, so no complaints. Portions were huge! The Nacho chips were about the size of my little hand.


Warning: Entrees came out searingly hot! We had to wait awhile to let our dishes cool down.

The Monterrey ($15 - $16)
Portions were immense! I'm not very familiar with Mexican food, but this dish seemed to have a bit of everything on it! My favorite part of this dish is the papas con chile - mashed potatoes basically - I couldn't get enough of it! In general, this dish contained 5 different enchiladas, a taco, the mashed potatoes, a dollop of guacamole, and beans. Overall, it's bursting with flavors and great for people with huge appetites.

Fajita Chimichangas ($11 - $12)
Very spicy~! Two huge chimichangas served with a dollop of guacamole and either papas con chile or brown rice. Boyfriend was very satisfied.

Pina Coloda ($7.75!)
Tasted good, but way too expensive for the portions. I can get a tastier and cheaper pina coloda served in bigger portions at Red Lobster's.


ATMOSPHERE - loved!

- big and clean
- Very nicely decorated
- Fun, lively Spanish music played in the background 
- Even though the place was busy, it didn't feel crowded or stuffy because the place is so spacious 
- Good for huge parties and families 


SERVICE

Decent. He could've been a bit more friendly. He seemed slightly nervous. Our entrees came out way too quickly, however.  We were still working on our appetizer when our entrees came out in a very short time period, and as mentioned earlier, our plates were hot! It was difficult to eat without burning ourselves."}
{"text":"Just ok. Decor was good but food was not good. Nothing was tasty. Not even the cocktails"}
{"text":"Terrible.

I agree with another reviewer here, the best part was the tasty after dinner mints, I had two.

I had immediate concerns when I was greeted by two unsmiling, unfriendly hostesses, who seated us in the bar and didn't even ask if we would mind sitting in there.  I was also a little weary that there was not one person of Hispanic descent to be seen, not a good sign for a Mexican restaurant in Cleveland. 
 
Chips were okay, salsa was smoky and very mild.  Queso was melted cheese, tasteless- was supposed to have poblano and anaheim chiles, but only saw a few bits.

After ordering fajita tacos and enchiladas with green chile sauce was informed that there was no green chile.  Fajita tacos were a little less tasty than Taco Bells; Enchiladas were tiny and bland. All this for about 10-12 bucks a plate, not exactly cheap; Charo beans were pretty good though.

So, bottom line, if you are craving good Mexican food in an enjoyable atmosphere, skip this place."}
{"text":"The food was great.  A little skimpy on the sour cream and fixins for fajitas.  Bacon wrapped shrimp was awesome.  Service was pretty good.  Server was quick on the refills and made sure the food was up to par.

My only complaint is the drunk guys seated behind our table.  Very vulgar and rude.  Personally i do not think they should have not been served any more margaritas.  It really ruined the meal due to the content of their drinken conversation.  Other than that decent place"}
{"text":"This place is consistently delicious! The price is a few dollars more than some other restaurants but if you want to enjoy everything, it is worth it. I haven't tried the prime rib yet but that is on my agenda."}
{"text":"This is a nice gem in the sandpit known as Arizona. An Awesome interior that really puts you in a Mexican villa with room for plenty. The drinks seem to be straight from bottle mixers but nobody seems to mind as the margaritas flow like the wine of Aspen. The cool tablet at each table has the ability to play trivia games with of tables... awesome!"}
{"text":"Came in for dinner. The chicken fajita salad was as bland as it could possibly be. Literally just chicken, lettuce, and a choice of dressing. No peppers, nothing to make it \"fajita\". Just bland chicken"}
{"text":"This was the second time I have eaten here. The first time I would give this restaurant 4 stars. This time was a different story. I'm not sure if the wait staff and kitchen was short handed, or if the crowd from a nearby ball park overloaded them. We arrived at 4:30 a party of 6. We were served part of our meals and had to remind the waiter twice that we did not get everything we ordered and one person in our party did not receive her meal for 15 minuets after we got the first part of our orders. When it came time to pay the bill the waiter was nice enough to split our checks I paid by credit card and he returned the bill for me to sign but my credit card was missing. He did find it but it took another 5 minuets. Bottom line I will go somewhere else if they look to busy. Their food is good but by the time we got everything that was supposed come with our fajitas our main dish was getting cold."}
{"text":"Got the combo fajitas lunch for 2, it was great!  Me and my friend couldn't not finish it.  Great price and the service was great as well!  Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Showed up at 940 the other night. The place closed at 10 You would have thought I shot the Hostesses dog. She informed us that they close in 20 minutes and we better be prepared to eat fast.  We were out of there by 10 20.  Should not let teenagers who want to go home greet customers."}
{"text":"It's been one of my favorite places to eat for years.  I usually have either the Monterrey or the Grande which are both big combos.  If I'm really hungry I can finish them.  For about $13? it's a lot of really tasty food.  My wife has tried a wider variety of the items and she has liked everything she has tried but I think her favorite is the Cozumel which is a seafood dish.

Service has been consistently good and they don't try to rush you out if you have a group that wants to sit and talk after you finish your meal."}
{"text":"Very good tex-mex food.  Our service was excellent and both times I went the manager came over to check on us, and made an excellent wine suggestion!  I had no idea wine went with Mexican food, but it was amazing!  Their veggie fajitas with black beans and lime cilantro rice are an excellent vegan option!  Margaritas are good too!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had a taste for Mexican food today so we stopped for lunch.  After living in California for the first 25 years of my life, I have yet to find a Mexican restaurant that reminds me of home.  This was not it either but will review based on the food only.

We both had a combination of different enchiladas.  My wife had one spinach and one avocado.  I had one shredded pork and one shredded chicken.  My wife loved hers and I thought the pork had lots of flavor.  The chicken was very bland.

The search continues for authentic Mexican food in the Madison area."}
{"text":"I know this place gets a lot of knocks for not being authentic, but the service is good, the food's fine and the decor is interesting.  To me, anyway.  They have this odd mashed potato side-dish thingy that you'll either love or hate.  Chips and salsa are good and plentiful, and I had a superb mojito or twothree here this summer.  

Would I go out of my way to eat there?  Probably not, but if you were paying, I'd say, sure, let's go!"}
{"text":"Visited while on work trip.  Food was yummy.  Service was kinda slow as we only had an hour lunch break and were late back to our conference.  Everyone seemed to enjoy their meals. Guacamole was delicious.  We needed more chips and they were not refilled until after our meals came... overall ok and I would visit again."}
{"text":"My roommate always raved about this place so I thought I'd try it. I wasnt really impressed. I liked the restaurant's looke but the food was just okay. I probably won't choose this place next time I'm craving mexican food but I wont be upset to go back either."}
{"text":"If you are around Chandler this is your place for dinning. We were visiting from LA and tried this place and so liked it that we came the next night too. Chips and salsa which they serve free is really good. We ordered Fajitas for two. It comes with your selection of two sides for each person. Try their special sites which is marked on the menu. We ordered steak and chicken it was also very good. Must try place."}
{"text":"Bland/odd tasting Mexican food for white people. Meh."}
{"text":"Abuelos accomplished a feat I have never experienced at any mexican food restaurant ever. 
I left and I was still hungry. I ordered two chicken enchiladas with rice and beans and while good they might have been the smallest enchiladas I have ever had. I was so hungry afterwards that I ordered another side of rice and beans, both of which came on these tiny plates, and did little to fill me up (when I brought this up to my service who literally seemed out to lunch while I was out to lunch, if that makes sense, he silently just looked at me and then moved on. So weird). My bill for one person was $20 with tip. To put this in perspective, I went to Popo's the following day and spent less than half of that amount of money and got so full that I had leftovers for my dog. I feel welcomed at Popo's. I didn't get that feeling at Abuelos."}
{"text":"I love Mexican food, and this place is always at the top of my list of places to go.  It is costs more than your typical Mexican food restaurant but the quality of food, the impeccable service, and atmosphere definitely make it worth it."}
{"text":"It was gross!
     The salsas where disgusting.
 Our actual food wasn't any better. 
            It was over priced food, that was disgusting. Next time I'll either make it myself or go to a Mexican drive through.  Already know those two options would be better"}
{"text":"Great bacon wrapped pork and enchiladas with sour cream sauce"}
{"text":"Since moving to the east valley in 2011 we haven't found a GOOD mexican restaurant...until now!  We love this place from chips & salsa through dessert.  My wife considers their tres leches cake one of the best desserts she's ever had.  Our server, Spike, recommended fabulous and reasonably priced entrees in addition to the aforementioned dessert.  No more searching for great Mexican food...it's Abuelo's for us from now on."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan.  Have been for years.  Just the IDEA of going to Abuelos can brighten my mood.  I usually order the enchiladas - various kinds, love them all.

A few reviewers have mentioned the service as subpar, but that hasn't ever been my experience at all - it's always been quite good, regardless of the server."}
{"text":"This place has great food and some great Mexican beers on tap. The bartending staff is wonderful and I would definitely recommend trying this place out during their happy hour or for a nice sit down dinner. Five stars."}
{"text":"Please get free WIFI, Abuelo's--have bypassed  stopping here many times for that reason.  Otherwise, consistently above average chain food--fresh and plentiful with prompt 
service and reasonable prices.  The chips are super thin with a variety of complimentary salsas.    I agree with earlier assessment of table game technology--tacky, unclear, and a bit sticky/germy  The decor is lovely and spacious.  The hostess might actually thank you when you leave--have visited many times, and they are generally all cadets--nice, but not focused."}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is very inviting, airy, and open. I was greeted promptly and seated right away. The menu is physically large while being surprisingly limited. The seafood choices are quite small, actually. Fresh chips, very light and not greasy, were served hot and with three different salsas. None of them are hot--the habanero was disappointingly mild, but your tastes may be different.
I ordered the vegetarian fajitas--be warned: the rice that is served with them is cooked in chicken stock so ask for white rice if you are a vegetarian. The fajitas were very undercooked: essentially just absolutely raw veggies on a hot plate. I sent them back for a bit more cooking and the arrived quickly cooked properly. Everyone makes mistakes. The tortillas were fresh and tasted good.
Overall, a good experience."}
{"text":"Just got back after a terrible dinner experience
We had a reservation for 9 and got a nice table assigned to us 
Waitress came by to take our drink orders and main course orders and stood at the head of the table and required us to shout out our orders. No explanation of the specials and no suggestions. Then she brought the main dishes and we are still waiting for the drinks and I had to remind her about this. I asked for some spicy sauce and she said that they ran out of the sauce at 730pm on a Sat night. Food was just ok. We ordered dessert and it was delivered without clearing the dirty main course dishes. I asked for a glass of water that came when I was about to leave
Last time I go here and the 1 star is a generous rating
Adios Abuelos!!"}
{"text":"My family and I had dinner last night (Sunday, 2/26) at Abuelo's.  Our server was Damaris -- she was an outstanding server!  She was prompt, helpful, polite, and very friendly.  Her service was excellent.

Michael M."}
{"text":"Best Mexican restaurant I've been in. Service is always excellent and the food even better."}
{"text":"Found the atmosphere cold and corporate. The food was mediocre at best, ordered the chicken fajita chimichanga, which was no doubt precooked frozen chicken, the sauce and veggies in the chimichanga were also reheated, extremely bland, and the food came out in literally well under 5 minutes, there is no way any meal could be prepared fresh that fast.  

Ordered a local ale on tap and the \"pint\" came in a ridiculously large stemmed glass, probably the most inappropriate way to drink an ale I've ever experienced.

What's with the touch screen terminal at every table? Whoever came up with this idea ought to be fired. 

Leaving 2 stars as the server was actually very good."}
{"text":"9 of us, with reservations arrived and waited maybe 5 minutes.  The ambiance was great - some noise letting you know others were there enjoying themselves, but not overpowering.
Lots of good things on the menu with reasonable pricing.  Great chips, margaritas and sangria.  Wait staff smiling. pleasant and knowledgeable.
The food was Mexican, but with sort of a continental flair without a hot Mexican spicing and cheeses.  All who LOVE Mexican food were happy and people like me - well I had the angel hair pasta, shrimp, peppers etc.
We all would and will go back.
Thank you Abuelos for a good time."}
{"text":"Love Abuelo's!!  Great atmosphere, delicious food, the drinks are great, and OMG the Tres Leches is amazing!!!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service! Our waiter was constantly checking to see if he could get us anything. FOOD IS AWESOME THOUGH! I was really impressed. It isn't cheap but still not that pricey.  I thought it was worth it. The kids enjoyed the green sweet salsa. They give you chips and three kinds of salsa when you sit down. Totally recommend this one!"}
{"text":"I've been to a few Abuello's and this one was ridiculous. My daughter and son have a dairy allergy. So we told our server that at the beginning. She brought out the manager because she honestly didn't know what was in the food nor had any idea about what a dairy allergy entailed. Apparently neither did the manager. He assumed margarine was fine and brought us the GFS sticks to show us. The ingredients clearly had dairy in it and we pointed that out. He advised us on a few dairy free foods on the menu that didn't use the margarine. After getting home both my kids had reactions and he is lucky it didn't send my daughter into anaphylaxis. Never visiting this one again."}
{"text":"Terrible service barely describes this place.  Sat at the bar so I could have a drink and get a quick meal to go.  It was at least ten minutes before anyone came over to offer chips, salsa and take my drink order.   I knew it was going to be a downhill experience when the \"bartender\" asked me how to make a Cosmo.  Seriously?   The drink came after someone else made it for her, about 15 minutes later.   I then asked for a menu.  That didn't come so after about ten minutes I got up to find my own.  A good half hour after the order went in, and my drink was gone, I asked the \"bartender\" to check the meal.  What a surprise!  They skipped over her order.  I suspect it had never been placed.  So over an hour, with no service, no checking to see if I wanted another drink and now no food, I asked them to refund my credit card.  The manager said OK no worries.  Actually no it wasn't okay since it was then creeping up on 8PM and still no dinner.  No apology just a refund.   Besides the lousy service, the place was dirty.  Dirty dishes on the bar and adjoining tables long after the customers took off.  Won't be back again - Go to Chipotle right beside the restaurant.  Your meal there will probably be better."}
{"text":"Went to this place this past weekend. The service was great, but like Crystal N. mentioned the food isn't really all that great. The lighting in there is a bit too dark as well. Seemed like I was eating in a movie theater or something."}
{"text":"So my husband and I went here for Valentine's Day. The wait was reasonable. I ordered the tilapia and a maragrita of course. I thought the food was decent, nothing spectacular. The chips and salsa were good. Not sure if tilapia was their speciality, would consider going again but I would definitly order something different (maybe fajitas)."}
{"text":"I went here by my lonesome self on a Wednesday night, it was quite busy but there was no line.

The interior is really nice, they have murals of Mexican theme on their walls, and the ceiling is like one of those Vegas hotels. Noise level is not so bad either, it's a good place to take a date.

I had better Mexican food that is much cheaper too, but  we have to remember we're paying for ambiance too. I got the rib eye steak with enchiladas and a margarita, there's nothing special about their steak either, ordinary steak that you also get at Denny's. I love their tortilla chips with 4 kinds salsa, the chips are thin and crispy that goes well with the salsas, you just can't stop eating.

Lastly I give their service five stars, my server who's name is Madison is really friendly and attentive but not intrusive, my drink took a little longer to come (which I don't know why since the bar is not that busy) but I didn't mind at all because of her positive attitude. She even gave me extra salsa and chips to go when I told her I really like the chips."}
{"text":"Love their food - and especially love the happy hour.  Cheap apps, and even cheap wine!  Where else can you go and get a fairly large glass of wine for 2 bucks?!?!  Will keep coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Great lunch specials!! Great margaritas! Bar service was wonderful & friendly....cant wait to come back!  Luv AZ"}
{"text":"Fast service. Weston was an awesome waiter. Loved the Chips and Salsa. It had a really pretty ceiling."}
{"text":"I have been here twice for lunch, and both times the food and service have been excellent. I will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat. The ambiance is perfect and the food is wonderful. I would be happy to go there again. 
We got spinach stuffed mushroom and quessadilla al horno as we had to save some space for Tres Leches. All these were really good and had a nice time.
Perfect place for a date."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants, hands down.

Last night's dinner was the \"make your own enchilada combo\" option. Their enchiladas are always a winner with me. The chips are the best I've had at any Mexican restaurant, and they offer a sweet, hot, and mild dipping sauce for them. Topping off the meal were the dessert nachos. This is a plate of eight nachos with chocolate and caramel drizzle with a mini scoop of ice cream on each chip. That is the way to end a dinner on a high note.

Service and ambiance are exceptional every time."}
{"text":"I love this place. Great food and great service every time I come. Drinks keep coming when they become empty and I love the 3 salsa they serve right when you sit down.  I love the chicken zuchinni it's a personal fav and the rice and steamed veggies are delicious as a side. Veggies aren't over cooked and they aren't smothered in grease."}
{"text":"After all of the hype this places seems to have I must say that I didn't really see what all the rave was about.

Quick Service

Great Chips & Salsa

Con's:
Dishes are to big, and quality is lacking.
Servers are not a knowledgeable as they should be

Will we go back? Maybe.........."}
{"text":"Great service in the bar. Quesadilla was just Okay. Had a lot of extra crap in it besides cheese. Mini shrimp cocktail only had 2 pieces of tiny shrimp in it. Bathroom was not clean."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food!  Ask for the really hot salsa it's the best!"}
{"text":"Been here twice and still the same thing . It's an overrated restaurant for mexican food. Not to be negative, but the salsa's for the chips are not a home made salsa. Salsa's are made in a blender so watery . Lemonade , I thought it was a natural made with lemons. Its made from Powder Lemonade .... c'mon ! Iv'e been to Family owned mexican restaurants and very good homemade flavors. Yes , there are some dishes that have good flavor don't get me wrong. But , I been to better places. Place is nice , flashy and spiffy.... the food not to impressive just imitation americanized mexican food. Bit pricey , I'll just stick to appetizers just to say I went to Abuelo's.

PS. Goerge... Im not getting info from nowhere about the Salsa.... I got it from the Waiter just to clear that up..."}
{"text":"The food was excellent and served in large quantities.  The atmosphere was busy and casual and family friendly.  We tend to seek out small family owned places and this was not that type of place.  The food was what won us over.  We will be back."}
{"text":"My wife and I continued our birthday by going to Abuelos. We'd driven by it a few weeks ago and since we love Mexican cuisine we felt we needed to try it. The atmosphere is excellent. They do a nice job of making it feel as if it's a Mexican establishment, but enough of that. My wife ordered chicken fajitas, and my mother ordered a mix of chicken and shrimp. They came to the table sizzling hot as they should have and both my mother and my wife enjoyed them. U ordered the Mexican city tacos with carnitas. The dish can come with either 2 or 3 tacos... my goodness the carnitas were seasoned to perfection. Juicy and flavorful without tasting too salty or spicy. The refried beans and rice that comes with the dish is amazing too. The beans were hot and they had a great peppery taste without being too spicy. (also we received a coupon for free queso with our help check in, and it tasted great). Plenty of menus choices and I'm hoping to return sometime soon."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Went on Sept 20 th and Manny was our server. He was top notch. I had enchiladas topped with a creamy seafood sauce. Delicious!! The desserts were very tasty. The Margarita pie nice and light. The Tres Leches cheesecake was heavenly. Highly recommend Abuelos for special occasions or just because!!"}
{"text":"Ate here again and they don't let you down here! Big servings and delicious food. Also always have a coupon of some sort on yelp. Another tip is if you eat here and you're a Costco member, they sell 4-$25 gift cards for $75! N"}
{"text":"I'm not sure if there is intense Mexican competition in Cleveland or what, but I really liked this place. The other reviews sound like they are describing someplace else.  I actually double checked the address before posting this. 

First, regarding service, we were greeted by someone when we first walked in and sat immediately. The place was fairly busy. The waitress was friendly, came quickly and took our order. When I mentioned the overwhelming size of the menu, she made specific recommendations. Overall service was fantastic. The assistant g.m. was checking on tables and stopped by to see how we liked everything.  The hostess asked how we liked everything on the way out.  The service was as good as it could have been!

The menu is daunting. Plenty of choices. ....I do wonder how they can maintain quality of the food across all those dishes, but we had no complaints!

Started with the Chili con Queso as recommended by people here. It was good. Regarding their home made chips, they are pretty thin and not the best I've had, but they were fine.

The mucho-sized margarita was delicious on the rocks with salt. Yum!

I ordered some type of grilled-chicken, cheese and poblano pepper in a lightly fried tortilla shell, and it was very nice. It was served with canned refried beans (they were so-so) and the Papas con Chile (whipped red potatoes with various cheeses and peppers) were good, but not as good as some others on Yelp thought.

The presentation of the food was fantastic.  The colors, the plating, the slicing on the bias, and so on was really top notch.

I will say that I think that the discussion of whether something is authentic Mexican or not seems counterproductive.  This is a restaurant in suburban Cleveland(Warrensville Heights, Beachwood, Harvard Park area, close by an exit on I-271)  Please don't confuse the food you had while on your apple-vacation-booked Cancun/Cozumel/Puerto Vallarta all-inclusive restaurant with something in the same shopping center with Office Depot and Buy Buy Baby. 

One might argue that your vacation \"Mexican\" food isn't very authentic, either.

Overall, while I'm sure I've had better Mexican someplace else, I simply can't find any substantive fault with the food, ambiance, or service.  I got exactly what I was expecting and was happy with the experience."}

as if they are in a more expensive restaurant.

On the negative side, they play terrible music.
The architecture and decor are wasted on the type
of music they play.  It would be more appropriate
to play some kind of Latin music or something
that fits better with the theme of a Mexican
restaurant."}
{"text":"So good, huge portions, decently priced. If you are looking to be stuffed and satisfied this is the place!"}
{"text":"Sammy was an outstanding waitress, food was great, but salsa needed to be thicker but it was really good albeit too thin! Perfect noise level for conversation!"}
{"text":"Love love love
This place great drinks and my favorite is shredded beef crunchy tacos. Happy hour is the extended version even on weekends . Join the loyalty club and get free meals."}
{"text":"Best margaritas and tomatillo salsa ever! Good enough for 4 stars, cause everything else is just ok."}
{"text":"I was really hoping that this restaurant was going to be great.  The service was great.  Our waiter was very attentive and knowledgable.  The margarita tasted watered down and very sweet.  The enchiladas really didn't sit well.  Very mushy and kinda bland.  The salsa was good"}
{"text":"Came for lunch and received pretty good food and great service! Well worth the money! I ordered the beef enchiladas, which were very tasty. Margarita was good too!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Great ambience, great chips and salsa too.  They even have a glutton free menu.  Love this place.  The food is all good."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant last week while visiting the area, and I love it. Very busy restaurant and great atmosphere. Our waiter was attentive but not hovering, and friendly. We had a pitcher of frozen strawberry margaritas---YUM! Enough for 4 of us to have 2 drinks each. Chips (free) came with 3 different salsas and were all excellent. Entrees were generous and priced well. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Pretty decent place.  Service the last couple of times I have been has been really good (we always sit at the bar).  Yummy sangria and great chips/dips (try the sampler).  Just had the Enchiladas de Cozumel on my last visit and they were very good."}
{"text":"We were excited to visit Abuelo's again since we first visited about a year ago.  We were disappointed.  The first time the food was outstanding but this time very average at best.  The service was good but the quality of the food was just not what we expected."}
{"text":"Meh... It's ok. It's \"white style\" mexican food. I mean don't get me wrong the avocado enchilada is the best. The papas on the side R like mexican mashed potatoe version which R good, nothing to write home about. The flan tasted like it was out of a box. The green salsa w chips for appetizer is the delish. We had team style waiters which would be ideal if the amount of people actually attended to our table. We had to wait until they remembered about  us to ask for stuff. I mean I would eAt there again for someone's bday or gathering but not by choice. It was just ok. The service was ok too."}
{"text":"It's good for your standard Mexican sit down restaurant, but taste wise it is nothing special. It's the usual - sticky menus, sides that taste microwaved, and it is actually overpriced compared to other similar restaurants. Chips and salsa are a 4/10."}
{"text":"Reminds me of a place back in Chicago me and my wife would eat at. Looking forward to the happy hour there, as the deals looked pretty good, and the food was excellent. Really liked it."}
{"text":"Your server will start your dining adventure with a trio of salsas that are all very tasty.  Their chips are light and crisp. We have enjoyed everything we have ever ordered from here, but especially the tacos and enchiladas with a side of papas. I have never had an issue with either the food or service."}
{"text":"Not sure why I put myself to go into this place the food never been good I think I just like the dress leches cake only thing I've ever had that was good here try the enchiladas tacos this time I tried the fajitas not good at all chicken was over salty really dry talk to you cook they're still kind of hard kind of cold even the server was very rude just had an attitude that she did not want to be at work I ordered pretty much everything through their dumb little computer because the server never came around soap to bring me the food they order do that ridiculous hopefully I learned my lesson this time not to go back or at least sit in the bar for some leches cake"}
{"text":"Wife had the enchiladas. They were bland and dry. Hardly any sauce on them. I had the grande burrito. The menu said it was so big you won't need the sides. Well, you will need the sides. Looked more like a crepe than a burrito it was so flat. The margarita/ Sangria swirl was really good. The service was indifferent. Won't be back."}
{"text":"The two stars are nostalgia stars for previous meals I have had in the company of my family here and do not reflect the truly pitiful service I endured on my most recent visit. My husband is a great cook and I can churn out tacos and enchiladas that are as good, or better than, the fare at Abuelos. I go to a restaurant like this to be taken good care of and enjoy good service on a day I am too busy to cook for my family. The fact that no one could be bothered to greet and seat me in a nearly empty restaurant (waitstaff actually looked at me waiting and then looked away rather than acknowledge me) and the fact that I couldn't get any help mopping up a spilled drink when I was the ONLY patron in the whole bar part of the restaurant and the bartender and waitress could not have failed to see me running to the bar to get cocktail (!) napkins (in a futile attempt to clean it up myself) is unforgivable. My advice is to enjoy one of the many other excellent dining options in Madison where service includes acknowledging their customers."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful late lunch, shrimp and carnitas tacos where very tasty, well seasoned, not too spicy, rice and  beans on the side. Chips and three kinds of salsa.  Definitely will be back"}
{"text":"I avoided this place for a long time because I heard it was a chain and immediately decided it would be terrible. I was wrong. 

We decided to give it a chance a few weeks ago. The salsa choices are amazing. I had fabulous fajitas (with far more toppings to choose from than most places) and my boyfriend had fish tacos which looked amazing. And the Sangria Swirl-- yum. 

We were so happy that we literally came back a week later. I had enchiladas (the choose your own trio) and they were all awesome. Try the chicken enchilada w sour cream sauce. 

My birthday is coming up real soon and I'm pretty sure this will be my choice for dinner!  On the pricier side but it's totally worth it."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful dinner at Abuelo's last night and want to thank Theresa, the manager, for being so kind and gracious. We would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone. The food was fantastic"}
{"text":"This was my favorite restaurant from Phoenix!  The chips and salsa were so fresh and flavorful!  I had the fajita salad and added a side of black beans. I tried my friends Chimichanga and it was absolutely delicious.   That says a lot coming from the home of TexMex!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately I have been to this restaurant multiple times and left disappointed. My wife and I enjoy the ambiance of the restaurant but not the food. Recently when we had gone we had been seated at an unstable table and greeted with a dirty salsa bowl and sticky seat then was asked if I wanted to play a game at the tables touchpad for $1.99. When the food came the beans were left under a heating lamp to long had dried them out. To top it off I ordered steak fajita tacos and ended up with steak and chicken mixed tacos that had an odd after taste. At the end I asked the waiter if the food usually looks like that and he replied yes. The only positive thing I can say about the restaurant is the waiters are quick and friendly. I will never come here again and will find another place for our company team builds. I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is where we come to settle my wife's craving for Mexican food, and we also meet friends here who simply love this place.  I am not a fan of Mexican food but a happy wife, right?  I think the prices here are a bit on the high side and we have never come here without having to wait, the shortest being about 10min.  The service is OK the staff always looks busy scurrying around like they have too many tables to deal with.  The food is pretty good and I have to say I don't think I have ever left hungry, good sized portions. I found out that this isn't my daughters favorite spot but she really doesn't eat anything but a bean and cheese burro anyway!  We find ourselves here mainly due to its proximity to us and my wife does like it here as well."}
{"text":"This place is eye candy - beautifully decorated! Every fabric, every piece of furniture, every wall treatment...OTT. The employees are friendly and well dressed, and everything from the food down to the dinnerware and rolled silver seems thoughtfully selected/presented. (the plates are expecially colorful and v. pretty) I ordered the Tilapia with the mixed veggies - both delicious - and I'd order that again...IF there were any Abuelo's where I live (California). *sigh*"}
{"text":"Waited over 10 minutes after being seated for Jose to get out and wait on tables.  Asked other servers and the hostess where our server was.  They had trouble finding him.  Food was OK, but it took over 40 minutes to get the food to our table after we ordered.  Worse service we have ever had at Abuelo's."}
{"text":"First time coming here after moving to AZ and if I could give it more than 5 stars I would. Amazing service and the food was superb. Will definitely come here more often. Well worth the price. The green sauce with the chips was really tasty."}
{"text":"Consistently good service, food never disappoints.  Great place to head when you're craving mexican food."}
{"text":"First visit here and loved the ambiance of the place right off. Very nice inside.
This was a lunch visit and had very prompt and efficient greeting, seating, and service.
  I had a chile relleno/ enchilada combo which was excellent.....beans and rice ----also excellent. Much better fare than macayos or garcias. 
  Also the best flan I've ever had. Definitely would and will return soon."}
{"text":"The service here was absolutely excellent. Food, just blah. Chips were fresh and crisp. Salsa, the variety is a great concept but I really didn't like any of them. Entrees, just not flavorful or enjoyable. I was expecting really fresh, high quality food. Disappointed. My husband enjoyed his meal more than me. I will say that when leaving the restaurant on Friday, there were a lot of people waiting for a table."}
{"text":"Soooo I was checking out my Yelp profile and decided to up my ante with another review... this time, not so great.  

I was starving (what else is new?) on a Friday night so I dragged my boyfriend out for some Mexican fare.  Let's start at the door: the hostess didn't look too excited to greet or seat us.  Our server took our drink order, we received our trusty chips and salsa, and got to work.  

The menu was pretty standard for an \"upscale\" Mexican restaurant, seafood selection and all.  After the server described \"The Monterrey\" plate as one you could fit a turkey on, I was convinced.  This hefty entree consists of four different types of enchiladas, a chile cheese relleno, chicken taco, and guac... how could we possibly go wrong?

The plate arrived ginormous, as promised; I just wasn't particularly impressed by any of it.  As much as I love food, I am a quality over quantity kind of girl, and this entree was not cuttin' it.  I honestly can't point out anything in particular that I did not like about the plate, it just wasn't memorable, finger lickin' good, or (please insert cliche here).  

When dessert was offered, we politely declined.  Our waiter dropped the check fleetingly and muttered a \"Thank You\" or something of that sort as he zipped past our table.  I do give the place props on decor, as the paintings, statues, and lighting throughout the restaurant are impressive and reminiscent of the culture of Mexico."}
{"text":"I use to come here all the time 5 years ago and it was wonderful! Today, I experienced the worst food and service I've ever had. The food tasted like it was a frozen meal, and the beans were as if they had been rosarita refried beans just put in the microwave! Not a single item tasted good, and our server seemed as if he was angry or annoyed with us from the minute we sat down. The hostesses didn't greet us, and sat us down without a word. The weirdest part was that they weren't even busy! The place was practically empty for a Saturday afternoon, so there was no excuse for the poor service. My boyfriend and I are always great tippers, but today was the exception and we only left the minimum 15%. The only reason for one star is that the atmosphere is very nice, and it is the only thing that I enjoyed."}
{"text":"This place has the best bacon wrapped shrimp ...enchiladas and potato papas we eat here every chance we get"}
{"text":"Customer service was lackluster. The food was okay but honestly I would've rather gone to Filiberto's and spend that money. Only reason I went there was because of a gift card. I've had better Mexican food."}
{"text":"Visiting Phoenix and were recommended to Abuelo's. We went at noon on a Friday with a party of 6 and were seated right away. They immediately brought hot tortilla chips (the thin, crispy, delicious kind) and 3 different varieties of salsas (fire roasted, verde, and traditional).  We ordered our drinks and meals and all was delivered timely and in perfect quantities. My husband and I had the steak and chicken fajitas. Others in our party had the chicken enchiladas with varied sauces. They stated that the \"cream sauce with jalapeños was out of this world!\" We got a pitcher of Dos Equis Amber and a carafe of sangria for the table to share. We eventually had 2 more people join us and they were very gracious in accommodating them! Our servers Margarita and Damaris were excellent and very friendly. It's a great restaurant  and I would highly recommend it!!"}
{"text":"Holy lord the sea bass was amazing and I want to give an extra applause for our server Matthew. He was incredibly helpful. He assisted in a mistaken drink order from the bar and uplifted my spirits with the Perfect dinner recommendation.

A delicious meal with great service"}
{"text":"Delicious food! I had a chicken and avocado enchilada. Second best enchiladas I've ever eaten (nothing beats las enchiladas de mi madre). Also, we had virgin raspberry margaritas, MmmmmmmMmmmm! 

If I lived in AZ this would be my go-to Mexican restaurant.

Our service wasn't that great. Our waitress hardly checked on us.... But the food was so good, the service only effected one star."}
{"text":"NOM NOM NOM!!!!!! Higher end, but so worth the price.  Was difficult to decide what to order since it all sounded good. Three salsas served with chips were good. We had the Pescado Guerrero, and Chile Rellenos (found only three seeds!). Both dishes were very tasty.  Did not have dessert. Too full.
Will be back!"}
{"text":"Service-outstanding, decor-nice, sangria-OK, food-mediocre. Nothing terrible, but nothing memorable or \"authentic\" either. Typical chain restaurant :-/"}
{"text":"Chips were good but crushed to little bits. Shrimp cocktail was terrible. Cilantro rice pretty good."}
{"text":"Someone said they had great Mexican food.  I ordered a chili relleno it came with beans and rice.  Nothing special about it at all.  The cheese was weird.  Usually its a white cheese and this was a sharp cheddar just didnt go well together and tasted odd.  The rice was tasteless like they didnt use spices.  It wasnt even worth eating.  Same went for the beans just bland and yuck.  I didnt feel like telling them but the waitress was really nice and she could tell that I didnt like it and she persisted so I let her know yuck.  She took it off bill which was nice but we wont ever be back again.  This experience happened a few months ago I just forgot to post the review."}
{"text":"This is my first time at Abuelo's in years. I have to say that my last time didn't leave a good taste in my mouth years ago. Hence, the reason I hadn't been in so long. Well, yesterday surpassed my expectations.  
When we arrived and decided to sit a high top table in the bar area. We were given water immediately. The chips were fresh, light and crisp. I absolutely loved the flavor of the spicy salsa. The waiter checked in on us often. I ordered the lunch steak fajitas. The steak was moist and tender.  The flavor burst in my mouth with eat bite! The rice and beans were perfect! 
I also had a frozen house margarita that had just enough kick to add to extra lunch giggles. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Simply put, this place is the definition of mediocre. The food was a solid \"meh\", and the three margaritas we had were all extremely weak and may not have had any tequila at all. Our server pushed us to get the Jefe margarita and that it was the best (for like $13). Again, meh. Tasted no tequila and the server had no clue what a reposado tequila was when I tried to upgrade my first margarita from a silver. At the end, I tried to rate the service using the table side electronic device and when he came over and saw I was rating my overall experience poorly, asked me to exit out of the service because the score went against him alone and not on the bar or the kitchen. Overall, it was a pretty uncomfortable experience for both of us and we wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Save your $80 for date night and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"The salsa...can I ever say enough good things about the salsa?  I could eat it with a spoon but instead I much on their thin, crispy chips that compliment the salsa perfectly.  

Their sangria is delicious and my hubby and I split a carafe every time we go there.  My only complaint is that you can't get the happy hour price if you are eating at the restaurant - which is just 5 feet away.

We love their enchiladas and there is a fish dish (whose name escapes me right now) that is amazing.

Service is always friendly and excellent.  By far, one of our favorite restaurants!"}
{"text":"Food is good but not close to great.  Service is very good.  When we are going to do Mexican we usually go somewhere else, for about 10 - 15% less we can get a comparable or better meal elsewhere.  You cant beat the chips and salsa though which why I give it 4 instead of 3 stars."}
{"text":"Nothing too new to add to the reviews of Abuelos... beautiful restaurant with mediocre, watered-down Mexican food. 
On the positive side, at least they have several decent vegetarian options. On the negative side, all of those options are loaded with greasy cheese and have very little seasoning.
The sangria tastes like fruit juice - ick.

Yet another disappointing Mexican restaurant in Phoenix - then again, I should have known better. It is a huge, corporatized chain outside a shopping mall..."}
{"text":"I honestly can't remember the last time we had service this great in any restaurant.  The server even recognized that my daughter was probably vegan when she ordered vegetarian fajitas without sour cream or cheese, so he brought corn tortillas instead of flour b/c the flour tortillas use milk ingredients.  He also explained it to her so she would know to watch for it in the future.

Great atmosphere, great food and great service, wholeheartedly recommend Abuelo's for a family dinner!"}
{"text":"This kind of creepy chain with a very creepy statue that greets you has succeeded in taking all the Mexican and Mexicans out of \"Mexican Food.\" 

While the balance of salt and fat on the large plate was pleasing to the tongue, it seemed pretty clear to me that nothing gets chopped or really prepared here, just reheated.

There was nothing wrong with the food, but I do not know why anyone would seek Abuelo's out. Maybe the pictures on the menu make people feel safe?

They are very generous with the chips and salsa. And the flaky light chips are especially addictive."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Tex Mex restaurant!! I love their queso dip it's so good and salsas are wonderful especially the green one! They have IPA beers so that is a plus! The only thing that is odd is the decor and atmosphere inside , it is in need of an update to make it more current but other than that the food is soooooooo good!! Im so happy I found this place it reminds me of being back home in the south. Tex Mex restaurants are hard to come by in Arizona.  It reminds me of El Chico in the southern states but BETTER!!!  My husband had the brisket tacos and he said it was the best he has EVER eaten!!!! He is very picky and hard to please so that says A LOT! My family eats here one to two times a week! It's that GOOD!! Please open a location near Paradise Valley!!! This is a great place for kids because they have game kiosks on the tables. My daughter loves playing on it! Try the cheese and onion enchilada with queso on top,,, it's so good!! Spike and Alonzo the bartenders are the best servers and bartenders!!! The chimichangas are the best! You must try their side of potatoes they taste like twice baked potatoes, delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Nice restaurant, friendly waitstaff...  Average corporate mexican food."}
{"text":"I stayed in Chandler for 3 weeks for my job and this is by far the best Mexican restaurant I have been to. Decent prices and great chips and salsa"}
{"text":"This is Tex mex food (not authentic Mexican food). But it is a good place. I have been here so many times and my favorite place is the spinach enchiladas con papas. And for dessert I like to get the tres leches cake."}
{"text":"Abuelo's is a good place to have an intimate dinner with family or friends. It is pricey for a poor college student but the portions are really big so you know you'll have left overs for the next day. They also give you chips and three types of salsa so you can just fill up on that too! Ha but all in all everything was pretty tasty! I doubt my nana would ever be able to cook something that intricate up (sorry nana) but they definitely have some crowd favorites that are well put together!"}
{"text":"We visited November 2012. It was a very good experience' the food was excellent as was the service. I can't wait to go back to Phoenix so I can try the other location in Chandler."}
{"text":"Now I remember why I haven't been back since they opened, the food is subpar.
The only reason I gave 2 stars is for service. The service was outstanding, of course we came during an off peak dinner time, so maybe there was an excess of waitstaff. 
I had a chicken fajita chimichanga, not what I expected. Could have been decent if prepared the correct way. There was one large pepper on top of few cubes of chicken, all wrapped in a doughy tortilla. And, quite honestly, it very well could have been pre-made and reheated upon ordering. It was definitely not fresh tasting. The beans tasted like they were straight from a can and the rice was dry and flavorless. Both remained on my plate. My husband and I split an order of nachos, which we actually laughed at when it was delivered to the table. Not quite what we were expecting. It was five pieces of halved corn tortillas with a sprinkle of meat and melted cheese.   When we order nachos, we expect actual nachos; not floppy melted cheese. My margarita was good, but for $10, I expect more than 3 or 4 sips from my glass. Very chintzy.
It was a unanimous vote from our table...we won't be back. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Go to Abuelos all the time...and have never been disappointed.  Amazing food..love the chips and salsas...and they have a great happy hour."}
{"text":"This place is gorgeous inside and very inviting. If you like Americanized Mexican this place is pretty good. I'm more of a traditional Mexican food lover. Service was great and timely. Everything was clean and portions are huge. Margaritas were tasteful and strong. Great place to bring a family."}
{"text":"I went out to this location on Sunday  night and I had Jose as my server end he did an amazing job, the food was excellent, I really recommend this place if you want some mexican flavor this is the place to go and of course Jose is great.."}
{"text":"Consistently good food and service. Thanks for keeping up the quality. There are more and more restaurants I put on my no-fly list but I am happy to come back to Abuelo's , thank you ."}
{"text":"This was my 1st time to this restaurant. We had no problem getting a table and the service was great. They have a wide choice of items to pick from. All the chips you want before and after the meal came. The food came out very hot so you have to be careful when you start eating your meal. Once it cooled down some it was digging in time. Waiter came around often with drinks and just asked us if we needed anything else. Come paying time it was no problem either. I will come back to this restaurant and try something else."}
{"text":"We just had my Mother's 100 birthday party in a private room.  Food was good.  The young servers were so good and went beyond their duties to congratulate and make my Mother feel special.  The manager was great to work with.  Helping to arrange a tv for viewing a tribute my brother put together for mother."}
{"text":"went with a party of six it jwas jfriday night a little busy but not packed our waiter was new? we jrequested more chips and salsa he brought the chips but forgot the salsa we had mostly finished the chips by the time he came back with the salsa then my son wanted a refill and my husband another beer he brought the soda forgot my husbands beer 10 minutes later i flagged him down and requested the beer again finally got it the food was not so great smallest cimichanga ever the beef in tacos and tamale was subpar  the beans were dry and had an off taste will not go back"}
{"text":"Fake Mexican food and expensive. If you like Macayo's,  you'll like this place, but pay more for the ambiance."}
{"text":"I liked the food and got more than I needed for dinner.  Plus, the chips and salsa were delicious - love the multiple options for salsa.  And, the happy hour was going until 7pm, so I got a cheaper margarita (but you have to be in the bar or patio for the deal).

Good service and the food was worth it."}
{"text":"Not great, if you are hoping for real mexican food, this isn't it. I am not sure how they charge as much as they do for this low quality food. The place was packed and I could only think it was for cheaper happy hour drinks because the food was not good. The service was ok but nothing special."}
{"text":"The build is beautiful and looks very expensive...I must say it is amazing and the service was great. My glass never went empty. I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Ate for the first time. Had the Fajitas Chimichanga and margaritas. I'm not a fan of chimi's because they are usually greasy. But this one was really good, lacked spiciness that I enjoy but was good no doubt."}
{"text":"This was really good! I have passed by here a 100 times and never been in. I was missing out! I love the cheesy decor that others have talked about in their reviews. I like it, gives it some charm and family feel for a chain. Almost feels like you are outdoors. 

Lets start with the Sangria. Mmmmm. That was some good stuff! The chips come out with three differnt salsa's. I loved 2 of the 3 and there was nothing wrong with the 3rd, just not my cup of tea. I had a shredded beef burrito smothered in cheese with guacamole. It was really good. Very flavorful and I would get it again in a second. The rice and beans were very good as well but next time I want to try the potatoes with chili. I had a bite of someone elses plate and they were fantastic, I was very jealous! 

Server was very friendly, fast, and kept our water filled and checked on us. Prices were reasonable and they have an email club that you get buy one get one free for your birthday. I will be back to try more menu items soon."}
{"text":"We were in Chandler just for the day and checked yelp for a good place to have Mexican food and saw the review on Abuelo's and chose it.  It was great! We would go there again next time in town, highly recommend it , good service, good food, good price."}
{"text":"GO IN AND REQUEST JOSE AS YOUR WAITER!!!! He is incredible. You can truly tell that he loves his job, and truly makes you enjoy your experience at the restaurant. From the moment he came to our table, he was smiling and very happy!! He took our orders quickly, and confirmed that they were correct, and then told us when he had put them in. He constantly was coming back to fill up our drinks, which was very nice. He never forgot about our table, and I know the next time that I go into this Abuelo's, I will request Jose as my waiter, and you should too!!"}
{"text":"Let's test the authenticity... So the restaurant and bar area were packed.  They offer seating in either the dinning room or the patio, and it took about 45 minutes to get seated.  The Margaritas were great... the food was respectable, not authentic.

The nachos\" tortillas cut in half, cheese melted to the tortilla (think cheese crisp) and a hunk of shredded meat neatly placed on each \"Nacho\".  Don't get me wrong, they tasted great, and they come with pico de gallo, guacamole, sour cream and shredded lettuce.  We also had steak fajitas, ordered the 2 person portion.  It was enough and then some.  They were good... not mind blowing, but very good.

All In All, it was a pleasant experience... the staff is very friendly and attentive, even on such a busy night."}
{"text":"This place is consistently delicious & the service really great also. I have tried quite a few items off both the lunch and dinner menu but my favorite thing that I have tried up to this point are the \"Stuffed Chicken Medallions.\" It's chicken breast stuffed with chorizo, poblano peppers and cheese and breaded then fried. Sooo not the healthiest meal but very tasty! If you are going all out, you have to get the \"Papas con Chile\" (creamy mashed potatoes) they are scrumptious."}
{"text":"Abuelos is one of my favorite Mexican places in town for the food! I've tried a few different dishes & my favorites are the Durango burrito, Chicken enchiladas, & the Spinach enchiladas. The papas con chile & rice are delicious sides which I opt to get every time (instead of the beans).

They have lunch prices for these items which are very affordable & the portions are pretty large too. The dinner prices are only a little bit higher with slightly larger portions, still worth the cost.

If you're really hungry (or going to share a dish), then the fajita options are great because they're really big & super tasty too! Their margaritas are strong and make for the perfect start to the meal. The salsas they offer with the chips are different than they typical ones. There's a light green one that tastes sweet to start off with but definitely has a kick to it. They also have a regular mild salsa & a hotter one.

I will agree with some of the other reviewers that the service is kind of off sometimes. We've gone during lunch time and they've tried to seat us in a corner table when there are much better tables open and it's not even busy. I'll always ask them to seat us in the middle section up-front now, which is sometimes received with a snarky comment but other times, no comment. I've been opting to get things to-go more often now for this reason."}
{"text":"Must try for Mexican food. I always get the Laredo and love the potatoes! The 7 layer dip is awesome too."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was great! Staff was very nice and attentive except for the hostess without the mostess!! She had an attitude that could have ruined the meal but everyone else made up for it. 
Food was very tasty and pleasing. Came out very fast and hot and fresh. For appetizers we had the jalapeño cheese fritters, mini chimmies,quesadillas, and the queso. Wouldn't order chimmies again, they were good but too much like an egg roll. Cheese fritters were pretty good, quesadillas were ok, and the queso was pretty tasty. Appetizers were overall were just ok I would skip except for queso. Chips and salsa was really good. 
For food I got the grande platter. It was amazing. My wife got the pork tenderloin plate that was also very very good. 
I had the platinum margarita, and my wife had the skinny which were both very good. Next time I would skip the appetizers we chose or try something different. But the food was amazing and so were the drinks!"}
{"text":"Fast and kind service. Great food. You can't go wrong here. Gets a little pricey with a big group but other than that it's amazing!"}
{"text":"We went here to celebrate my fathers 77th birthday. My nephew who had just joined the Marines and was being deployed was also with us visiting. So to say this was a special time for us is an understatement. To make a long story short from the reservation on, began a list of things that went wrong. The list did remain short, but I have to say that we were BEYOND IMPRESSED with how they handled our situation. We NEVER expected management to pick up the tab but surprisingly they did.  The food was still incredible as usual, the drinks were incredible as usual and this will remain one of our top 3 favorite restaurants all because of how management decided to right our wrong! Thank you, thank you, thank you. I SERIOUSLY appreciate you turning a positive into a very special and memorable time for me and my family."}
{"text":"This past cinco de mayo, my crew and I went on a hunt for an delicious and elevated meal to satisfy our festive cravings. What we eventually found was probably the most up scale and well managed Tex-mex restaurant I've ever seen, and it certainly didn't disappoint. 

After sitting down at a Mexican restaurant, the first judge of quality for me is always how fast the chips and salsa come, and how fresh they taste. Ultimately, I was thoroughly impressed that they came out right away, and as fresh as can be. We waited a little bit longer for our food than I would have liked, but they were fairly busy being that it was cinco de mayo, and they kept the fresh chips coming. 

While we waited, we ordered a large bowl of guacamole. The guac cost us about $10, and it was enough to keep our table of 6 happy until the food finally came. I was feeling Extra hungry, so I decided to go with the grande combo. I would advise you only get the grande if you're either a giant like me, or you want to take most of it home. You may read the description, see a picture and think it's not so big... NOTHING can prepare you for the meal you're about to encounter. It looked like a plate they would bring for an entire table at a family style restaurant. You could probably fit two turkeys on the steaming hot plate it's served on. Everything on the plate was delicious! I also love how easy it is to pay with the little tablet things they have on each table. 

We'll definitely be coming back here and I'll probably end up stuffing my face with the grande again in the near future."}
{"text":"My wife and mother in law really like this place. Me, not so much but I am not one to jump in the car because I am craving Mexican food. The food on this recent visit was tasty but the service was at best confusing. 

We were taken care of by 4 different people, our server who took the order and brought drinks (started out can I get you something to drink?, which sort of makes me crazy, offer me something specific or tell me your favorite), another that brought our food and I love this, this means they care about getting food out while still hot, so thank you! In the end we were brought our check by another server and when I handed back the bill to him it took a little while to finally get it back...from yet another server. I understand team work but usually it comes along with a little communication. Where did our first server go? No mention if he went on break or dropped into an abyss. 
I have never seen a manager in this restaurant, at least that I can remember. I happen to like when the manager stops by and says hi and asks how the staff is doing on our visit. 
I am sure I will be back because the ladies of the house are fans and I wont have to go kicking and screaming because food is usually good, I just will not expect to be \"wow\"ed by the staff."}
{"text":"My husband and I were out for a movie and dinner Friday night and decided to eat someplace different . Yes, even we get stuck in a rut and we wanted to try our luck here.
For a Friday night we were pleasantly surprised that restaurant wasn't jammed packed and with a lengthy wait but we were seated quickly near the bar.
Our server offered drinks and we got them in a flash with chips and salsa. The green one was refreshing and very yummy.
I had no problem finding vegetarian options, which I find is usually the case when we dine out. I LOVE black beans and was happy these are on the menu.
I ordered the Veggie fajitas, I know so \"typical\" but I was in a playful mood and they sounded so darn good. My other half was perusing the menu and a bit shy to order fish (his favorite by the way) since most places over cook it or serve it plain and dry. Salmon is his to die for food and so it was this evening.
We had about a hour or so before our movie and the food arrived quickly so no worries there!
My husband dug in rather hesitantly into his fish and I into my aromatic sizzling vegetables. I was munching down when I realized there was no sound coming from across the table.
Haha.. he was thoroughly enjoying his fish! He said there was flavor and that the fish was cooked to perfection. Moist and not dry at all. The sauce he said was delicious.
Coming from him that is a Gold Award :)
We had enough time to finish our margaritas and make it on time to our movie without breaking a sweat.
The decor is colorful. There is a central area that reminds you of a courtyard . It was pretty busy there the night we were there and the bar looks very friendly. We see there are lunch specials and the Happy Hour has some tasty looking tapas style offerings so we will definitely be coming back for HH."}
{"text":"Really good food here! The mild salsa was sweet and very flavorful. Ordered the steak and enchilada with a side of mashed potatoes which were all delicious! The steak was really juicy and the chicken enchilada were both superb! Their classic margarita was so-so though. Overall great food at a good price!"}
{"text":"I've visited here before, but we recently had a group of about 12 people for dinner and they accommodated us nicely. Our sever was very friendly and funny, he took great care of us during our dining experience. The food has always been fresh and everyone said they enjoyed their meal. It wasn't too busy, but our food came out within a reasonable amount of time. I normally order their fajita steak tacos and they were very good, like usual. The chips and salsa never ran out and we ordered queso to go with our chips. The portions and pricing are good and many of us had leftovers."}
{"text":"We stopped by for dinner last night. The service was fantastic, we had Anthony as our waiter and he was great! He made recommendations for appetizers, entrees and desserts! He even helped making recommendations for a vegetarian. Our food came out very fast, which is surprising for having 7 people at a pretty busy dinner time. Our food was very hot, fresh and delicious! We haven't been in for years but with such a great visit we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Good food- although some dishes better than others.  Service is hit or miss. Don't go here if you're in a hurry...The fajitas are terrific.  It's a nice atmosphere to go with the family and the kids' menu is great.  My son is a big fan of the cheeseburger taco."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why it took us so long to try this place.  We used to live close to this place, but didn't try it until we left.  Sure this is a chain restaurant, but it knocks it out of the park for me.

The restaurant is very nice on the inside and the food matches.  I always order the chile rellenos and they are stellar! Usually we order the avocado cream dip for an \"appetizer\" to go with the chips that come to the table.  It's probably just avocado with sour cream mixed in, but it is so flipping good."}
{"text":"Wow!  This restaurant would be a blazing success in Bozeman MT!  Having been in the high end food business for many years, I instinctively look for indicators about the quality of the business. Here are some of my observations:  The physical plant presents a wonderful first impression.  It's beautifully designed and executed.  Peeling back the physical impression a bit, it was obvious that the staff was well trained, upbeat and professional.  The menu was extensive, offering a wide array of attractive choices at reasonable prices.  The meals were tasty and artfully presented.  Our server was Jose Mor who was an engaging, professional guy who would make even a bad meal a wonderful experience.  Our dinner was exceptionally well prepared, very nicely complimented with service that was over the top!"}
{"text":"I liked the chips and salsa it was a good side. There meat leaves a little bit to be desired but it cooked while. I think they had good survive tho. There seafood is excellent and would recommend it to a bud."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and don't eat here.  Because my office was located near this restaurant, I was sucked into going here several times.  Each time was worse than the time before.  The only good thing on the menu is the queso dip and how can you really screw up cheese dip?

The service stinks.  I don't have much more to say about it than that.

The food has Mexican ingredients, but is just about it.  I didn't walk in expecting traditional Mexican food, but at least some semblance of it.  Yeah, they have a burrito and a tostada, but you can get better at Taco Bell most days.  

At least when I walk into a Chipotle there is no disguise that you are going to be eating some seriously Americanized Mexican food.  Here, you walk in to a huge building with the appropriate trimmings to be a good Tex-Mex restaurant.  But it falls short on all fronts.  

Oh yeah, never get the margarita.  The mix that they use will burn a hole through your stomach."}
{"text":"Used to eat at Abuelo's pretty regularly when I was working around Lubbock TX.  First time eating at the Chandler location tonight, and it did not disappoint!  Our server Christina was absolutely fantastic!  Very personable, excellent positive attitude, refreshing!  The Sangria Margaritas they serve are very nice, way better than I've had elsewhere!  The food we ordered came out in a very timely manner, another positive mark in my book, especially being a former F&B guy myself.  We ordered Fajitas for two, beef and chicken combo, and they were very good.  The sides Christina suggested were top notch as well, especially the spinach!  This is a big, beautiful restaurant that has stood the test of time!  Glad I finally made it out to this location, will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I have never had a bad experience at Abuelos. We have tried their fish, steak, drinks... You get it. This was one of the first places we ate at in the valley when we moved here 7 years ago. 

My favorite is the Ribeye and enchiladas with The Grande as a close second. My wife loves the Tilapia and the Alhambra de Cameron. The Sangria should be purchased by the carafe, don't waste your time with having to reorder. :) 

So long story short, great food, good for families, visitors and large groups. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"OUR VISIT was during their FIRST several months of operation - and, in all fairness, was still getting their footing with kitchen and staff!
Sorry - a chain restaurant - and very very average to lousy food.
The salsa was weird tasting, the meats tough, the rice and all of the extras were simply bad.
Also - for carry-out, just don't bother.  They will NOT get your order correct - ever!

There are better Mexican restaurants in town that are not a \"chain\" that have excellent kitchens and experienced chefs!!"}
{"text":"They have recently re-printed the menu, as the pricing is a little higher.  But the quality of the food is great, their service is fast, even in \"rush hour\" they still get the food out of the kitchen and on to the table.  I like the 'Sonoran' with it's cheese sauce and the 'Papas con Chile'...   This is Mexican food at it's finest for a chain restaurant.  On the Border needs to learn a few tricks from these guys."}
{"text":"We are here on vacation and amid all the chain restaurants, this one is outstanding. Great chips and 3 salsas to start. Our waiter saw us inhaling the Salsa verde, made with pineapple and lime, so brought us another huge bowl! I had the tilapia Veracruz off the lunch menu even though it was dinner. A huge portion with a definite kick. My husband had the shrimp fajitas and really liked them too. Vegetarians beware the beans do have bacon in them. Wish there was an Abuelos at home."}
{"text":"I just did not care for style of taco shell in a nice dine in restaurant. Too much of a taco bell shell!"}
{"text":"First time dining here and the food is awesome. The fajitas are to die for and the chicken chimichangas are amazing. Definitely get the red sauce and the mashed potatoes, you can't go wrong with. Lizette was our server and she was outstanding. She kept coming back to check on us, gave us great recommendations!! Definitely would come back and having lizette was a bonus."}
{"text":"another ok mexican restaurant...nothing special

We ordered the big enchilada plates where you try out a few different ones...not impressed

Chips and salsa were good!

Probably wont go again."}
{"text":"I could not be more happy with the service and food from Abuelo's. It was not cheap but you get what you pay for. I had the enchiladas; one avocado and one chicken. They were absolutely amazing! Very clean throughout the restaurant and restrooms. Decor and ambiance are also very good. We will be coming back to Abuelo's. Hopefully we get the same waiter (can't remember his name) but he was great."}
{"text":"Outstanding as usual!

We have been enjoying the food at this location for years and have never commented. Well, we have not been disappointed.

The 10oz Ribeye & enchiladas is fantastic. 
Los Mejores de la casa - another favorite!
Stuffed Chicken Medallions are crunchy with a hint of spice!

The sangaria swirl and $3 house wine are also make us smile everytime.

Gets really busy - worth the wait!"}
{"text":"My entire family loves Abuelo's! You can typically find us there once a week during happy hour. Their food has ALWAYS been delicious and the price makes it even more awesome. I've never had to send back food or have ever felt like it was just \"okay.\" It's always hot and they use great quality meat and fish. If you've never been, I would recommend trying their enchiladas which you can basically create the way you like, and their papas fritas(mashed potatoes with a Mexican twist) so good! On top of great food, they have great service and the restaurant/bar and bathrooms are always clean!"}
{"text":"We as a party of 3 were sat before a party of 7 and yet for some reason the party of 7 had their order taken and their food delivered before anyone paid attention to us. We asked for tortillas 3 times before getting them and no communication happened so we then got multiple sets of tortillas, they didn't not taste fresh, food was either cold or Way to hot to eat. Very disappointed with this location."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great bartender, very happy, and have a chance meet my 52 years ago classmates"}
{"text":"Anthony was the best server we've had here! He recognized we are regulars and asked if we wanted the grownup size dip, the meals were all awesome. I've been here over 20 times and this was the best service yet, great teamwork folks!"}
{"text":"Okay food, overpriced kiddy cocktail margarita and bad service. Our night started out at the bar. The \"Platinum Margarita\" was anything but. Watered down and over sugared, I'm not even sure the 1800 was in it. By the way, 1800 is no Patron so let's not kid ourselves with the Platinum designation. From there we were seated in the restaurant. Decent chips with several nice salsas.

We then ordered dinner, and we were served. Okay so far. From there, I hit the \"call server\" button on the cheesy video game controller at our table and watch our server take the order from the table across from us. No biggy he didn't come right over, but zero acknowledgement after he takes their order and he and the next 5-6 servers walk by our table. I pull one to the side and ask for more hot sauce - nada. I grab our guy and he defensively explained to me, on two occasions, that I had to understand he was taking care of another table. Not worth the price and not a place I would recommend. You can do better, Peoria. No bueno."}
{"text":"Just left their happy hour. Food and drink specials are really good but the bar service is definitely in need of an upgrade. It took 10 minutes just to order my first drink and I waited so long for her to come around to ask for my second drink that I just gave up. Bartender seemed to be overwhelmed at times then goofing off with other coworkers instead of checking on people at bar at other times. This would've easily been a 4 or 5 star review with better service."}
{"text":"Pleasant and comfortable atmosphere.  Prompt and happy staff.  Prices were reasonable with larger portions so possibly a few left overs to doggy bag.

My group felt the menu had lots of items to choose from.  Food was fresh but some items lacked that wow punch of flavor.  Others felt the food was outstanding.  So it's variable . Chips and salsa were very good though with several types to choose from.  

Lots of space for big parties, and we would go again or recommend it to others."}
{"text":"I'm sitting at abuelos right now. This place is great, if your looking for a Mexican restaurant inspired by Costco.  No flavor. No ambiance. And no way I'll ever come back."}
{"text":"The setting here is very relaxing. The food is amazing. Yes, the appetizer came out late but Manager Kelsea was very accommodating. The Waiter Manny has done a great job trying to keep up with a busy night. But I digress.....the food.....oh man the food.....the spinach stuffed mushrooms....simply wow. The fiancée had some issues with the spicy food but like I said before Kelsea was on top of everything and assisted my fiancée in getting a good mix of food. Now just waiting for dessert.....heading for flan town."}
{"text":"Good food, great friendly service. Ms. Alex a server was amazing. super sweet. Just a beautiful person. Thanks for the great food and excellent service. Pssss they have tamales if you ask, you can substitute enchiladas for Yummy tamales!!! The chips are thin and freshly baked deliciousness and so is all the salsa. This place is just beautiful, great first experience!
The house margaritas were on point! I only had two, very pleased. It is hard to find a good margarita in my opinion, they hit the nail on the head for me.

The receptionist ladies were also very friendly and helpful.They even helped us take a family picture to celebrate my Mother's birthday so I could be in the picture too! Thanks again ladies!

I can't wait to bring/introduce my husband and others to this lovely establishment. 

Great nice ambiences for a date or a business or family get together. #NewFavoriteSpot! #ArrowheadLocation"}
{"text":"This restaurant is so beautiful! It's big and decorated so nicely. We enjoyed our food and drinks the 3 salsas and chips were so good. Generous portions. The issue we had was service very slow and our server left all surrounding tables with plates from the lunch crowd."}
{"text":"I know it's a chain, it's only semi-authentic, but I don't care!! Let me tell you why I love Abuelo's... CHIPS and SALSA-- ask for their two hotter salsas if you like it spicy. I love the one they serve warm, I think they call is \"salsa brava.\" The chips are so thin and crisp, yum.

I also love their hand-shaken margarita, it's made with premium tequila and lime juice, not mix!!

I also always order the Monterrey platter, it's huge so you can share or take some home. Get the papas!! I don't care so much for their rice and beans.

Uhh I don't know why so many people have been disappointed. I love it!! However, I always order the same thing."}
{"text":"Never been a fan of the food here. Very mediocre. 

That being said, this is one of the nicest Mexican restaurants in terms of decor and ambience. 

On a good note... the salsas are very good and taste fresh."}
{"text":"Frickin' noms!

It's so hard to find decent gluten-free food at a reasonable price and their three taco dinner was both. The only tacos I've had that came close to tasting that good are from this franchise in Chicago that we all know and love down here (but Abuelo's tacos are even better, which is difficult for me to say seeing and how I've been eating at this other place since I was five and have a ferocious attachment to it in my limbic system [the part of your brain that hangs on to memories and emotion]).

The cilantro-lime rice sounds disappointing at first like it is at Chipotle, but when you taste it, you'll be so happy you ordered it as one of your two sides. It's so flavorful and has just the right amount of kick. Oh, and the vegetable medley isn't a tasteless pile of frozen mush that you'll find at other places. You can tell that they were steamed fresh because they're still a bit crisp.

The short, Latina server whose name I can't remember was this little ball of personality. If you wear a pink bow in your hair and remind her of Hello Kitty, she'll adore you for the rest of your life. I seriously want a little version of her that I can keep in my pocket and take out whenever I'm sad. 

Next time I'm in Madison, I'm coming back just for her. And the Tacos. But really for her.

Sidenote: if you like spice but don't like the taste of the roasted salsa, mix it with the tomatillo-pineapple one at a one to three ratio. You'll get the flavor of the salsa verde with the spice of the roasted one. 

And request that tiny spitfire as your server so you can tip the crap out of her! (do eet)"}
{"text":"We always seek out an Abuelos when traveling because we used to live near one and know how good they can be. This visit was regretfully our worst ever. Slow service, overlooked chicken tenders for our toddler, and appetizer came out after entrees."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite Mexican restaurant in the East Valley. I have never had a bad experience here. Consistently great food and service. My favorite meal is the Beef Chimichanga with cheese (dinner portion). I always bring family and friends from out of town here!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Abuelo's is a cool place, lively, colorful and generally pretty fun. The food is hit and miss. For example, I had a combo dish with a relleno, and it was one of the best chile rellenos I've ever had. Cheese enchiladas were so-so, and the taco was just kind of there and not happening. Chips and salsa were really good... They bring you 3 different kinds of salsa, and the tomatillo/pineapple one was relish! I'd go back, but it's a long way from where I live, so I wouldn't be making a special trip just for this place."}
{"text":"The Good - Our server, Emily, was very sweet and fairly attentive considering how many tables she had on a Sunday night.  Their chips and salsa were fantastic.  Their green salsa is out of this world.  It's a really good thing I really liked the chips and salsa and was able to chow down, because dinner...

The Bad - Two things
One - I ran into something at Abuelo's that I've run into at a Chili's and I've learned a couple other chains are starting to do...Applebee's is the one I recall a friend mentioning.  There was a digital screen on our table!  At my Chili's experience, I learned that one thing they do with these screens is make available the specialty menus - vegetarian, gluten-free, vegan, kosher, etc.  Ok, fine.  I didn't ask Emily to pull up a veggie menu on the screen because, frankly, I wanted nothing to do with it!  The first thing we did was put our screen face down on the table.  It was impossible not to see the screens on other tables as they flashed through quizzes, games, information about the restaurant's history, etc.  I can only guess that Abuelo's is trying to get families to all interact with the screen so people all don't all pull out their cell phones while waiting for their food to come out...I HOPE that's their goal, anyway.  The presence of these things just depressed and sickened me.  Do Americans really need this sort of stimulation?  What has happened to the art of dinner conversation and coming together to talk about our days?  Abuelo's, why are you adding in more digitainment to distract those of us actively trying to - for example - teach our children that dinner-time is a time to put AWAY the electronics in order to enjoy one another's company?  Ugh!  Yuck!  Why?


Two - As a vegetarian, I'm used to ending up with black beans and some other rice substituted for the usual rice.  I'm not used to the beans being so salty they can't be eaten.  I also think they would have been better trying for maybe a little salad instead of their \"specialty cilantro rice\".  It was literally white rice cooked with cilantro and I think that was IT.  No seasonings to speak of.  Bland, bland, bland!  I got the avocado and the spinach enchiladas per the server's suggestion.  They were in some sort of crepe wrapping and tasty enough, but honestly...for the price it seemed like they should have doubled the number of enchiladas.  It really wasn't much food once you factor in the rice and beans I couldn't get myself to eat.  (I brought them home to have someone else taste test just to make sure I wasn't being too picky...sorry Abuelo's...it wasn't me!)

Abuelo's was a HUGE disappointment.  Thankfully, I had great company?  Truly, I can see the potential of this place.  It could have fantastic.  They claim to be old-fashioned Mexican food and the presence of lard in the refried beans and the use of chicken stock in the rice backs that claim up!  They've got a HUGE menu.  I think that if a bit more thought were put into vegetarian options and those darn screens went away, my review of this place would improve dramatically.  The whole feel of the place would be different!


Last note about those screens - apparently they can be used to pay for one's bill.  As someone who's lived in Silicon Valley and hung out with many, many, a computer expert...when it comes time to pay your bill, please RUN from these wireless terminals.  Keep your credit card info safe.  Have the restaurant run your card the old-fashioned way!"}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of Abuelos. Last night my husband and I went with my best friend and her parents. I got a glass of sangria. Previously I recall really enjoying their sangria but last night there was an overwhelming taste of cheap alcohol. Upon reviewing the menu I did see they were using Sutter Home which isn't good by any means. My husband enjoyed his beer, particularly because it came in a frosted goblet. I ordered the Monterey which came on a platter big enough to hold a turkey. It was a bunch of enchiladas, a taco and more. I loved the potato concoction as a side, whatever it is called. Service was okay but certainly not the best I've had there. The contraption at the table where you pay is a little odd and impersonal but I guess that's the direction we are going in the world."}
{"text":"I decided to pick a new place for my daughter and I to try on Oct. 30th. Being I'm nervous in public I asked for a booth which they were happy to help with even though it was the busy dinner rush. The waiter was very helpful, he even was nice enough to take a few moments to answer a few questions about the quieter times. From 9pm till 10pm on weekends it tends to be quieter!

Chips were served with 3 different salsas( mild, a green pineapple based and hot)
My daughter and I started with a cup of the tortillas soap which was lovely, the chicken melted in our mouths. We then choose to share 3 cheese enchiladas with ranchro sauce,re-fried beans and Papa con Chile. For an extra special treat we shared a Chocolate Eruption.... When it arrived it was a nice size with vanilla ice cream on one side and a nice dollop of whip cream on the other."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying I'm not a fan of Mexican food.. ok, I really hate most if it to be honest. But that's not why I'm giving 3 stars. 

I went on a date and she has been wanting to go here for a long time, and she didn't know I don't like Mexican food because it was our first date. I can find something on any menu to eat, so it was no big deal for me really, I wanted her to be happy (awwww such a nice guy!). We arrived, waited only a few minutes and were seated.

We were greeted promptly by our server, can't recall his name though but he was rather serious in demeanor. He took our drink order and promptly returned with our drinks. My date had a mango Margarita and she loved it. But then it kind of went south a little from there. When he took our food order, I told him I wanted Prime Rib. His reply was \" we don't have that\". Confused, I reached for the menu because I know I saw it, and it was only then he said Prime Rib was only available on Thursdays. This was a Sunday. Ok, kind of 'short' in his response/approach, but let's move on. He took our orders with less enthusiasm than I've seen on a 2 year old's face in a timeout and then he left.

The food came VERY fast and my date loved hers. Mine was good. We were done for quite a while before the server returned. I asked if they had desserts. He responded by pointing at a menu tent on the table and walked away. That was nothing short of rude in my opinion. He was gone for a while but we were able to get our dessert order in and received it promptly, but then proceeded to sit there for a good 15 minutes after we were done before he came to our table with the bill. He visited the table next to us 3 times in that 15 minute period. We decided to sit and chat for a bit after that, again 1st date and it went GREAT by the way :) The server came back to our table and picked up the signed credit card receipt, just asked if it was ready. I said yes. He took it and walked away. No \"thank you\". No \"come back again\", nothing. He had his money and he was gone!

Overall.. good food, decent atmosphere, greeters were friendly but this server was not. Sorry he had a bad day.. but don't drag down your customers. Customer service really seems to be going downhill in general."}
{"text":"Would recommend this place if your looking for authentic Mexican. They have an extensive menu of options, but if you're looking for \"Tex mex\" you will have less options than you might at another place. 

They offer a number of salsas from mild to spicy automatically at your table, which is fun to sample!  The enchiladas deserve a menu of their own, you can completely customize your filling and sauce and they have options that far surpass run of the mill. 

The interior is beautiful and has a much classier feel than the typical Mexican restaurant. If you're in the mood for nicer MEXICAN Mexican restaurant with healthier options this would be the place to go."}
{"text":"We started with chimis and jalapeño cheese bites as appetizers. The dipping sauce for the chimis was sweet and tangy, a pleasant surprise. The jalapeño cheese bites were not spicy, and were closer to hush puppy consistency than I expected.

We ordered an enchilada sampler and shared it. It included 4 enchiladas (spinach, cheese, avocado, and a meat), a chile relleno, beans, mashed potatoes, and a dollop of guacamole. The meat and spinach were my favorites, but the other two were also good. The beans were thick and hard. Next time, I'll get the rice.

Although it was good, and definitely enough to share, I think I'll stick to their seafood. On another visit, I had the Tilapia Vera Cruz, which was delicious and unique.

Most meals are a bit high (about $18 - $24). The seafood is worth it though. 

The décor is pretty. It reminds me of the casual opulence of the Paris casino in Vegas.

By the way, CostCo members can buy $100 worth of gift cards for Abuelo's for $79.99. The server didn't have any problems accepting it.

In response to the manager's question: I may have tried your margaritas in the past; but it's been too long ago to remember. During our last visit, my boyfriend enjoyed his beer, although I don't remember the brand."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to Abuelo' s in over 3yrs. and sadly it's really gone downhill. The service was great, but the food not so much.

My friend asked if they could make her a bean & cheese chimichanga which is not on the menu, and we figured easy enough to do, but I guess not because our server said it couldn't be done. She got a meat chimi that she wasn't to excited about. 

I ordered my usual that I used to get a few years ago the ground beef enchiladas. The flavor was okay, but not at all what I remembered. The papas were a fave of mine, but today they were bland. The refried beans were so dry. I hardly ate any of my meal it was so disappointing. 

The decor in this place is beautiful, but not worth coming back."}
{"text":"In A Nutshell:

-Abuelo's is a fantastic Mexican restaurant.
-It's very big inside w/ plenty of seating and lot's of great visuals.
-It's also a awesome place to pre-game for drinks/food before you head over to nearby Peoria Sports Complex.
-You can also park in the parking lot and walk to the baseball field.
-The nachos were really different from what I'm used to b/c you are served a big circular nacho w/ cheese on it and sliced like a pizza.
-The drinks were so delicious b/c they come served in thick, ice cold glasses.
-If you order a margarita, you'll get your own margarita glass and a personal shaker w/ ice & margarita inside which you can shake up and pour to your desire.
-The Don Julio 1942 shot was HUGE.
-It was only $22 per shot and the shot was like a triple shot.
-Normally, Don Julio 1942 shots are $30 to $35 for a small shot.
-Finally, the chips & dip were light - the chips can be purchased to take home.

Overall, Abuelo's is now on my rotation, it should be on yours if you live in the area or just visiting."}
{"text":"After our bad service at Don Ruben we came to Abuelos. Service was great and food was great. We got seated right away and server (Austin) arrived right away taking our drink order. Less then a minute later we received the drinks and ordered our appetizers. When we received our appetizers he took our dinner order and shortly after finishing the appetizers the food came. The service was amazing and food here is always great. Cost was a bit more then Don Ruben would have been but we'll worth it since we actually received service here."}
{"text":"A group of us decided we want to give them a shot. All signs said they opened at 11:00 am. We arrived a little early at 10:55 so we waited in the car till 11:00, went and tried the doors, locked. We waited till 11:15 and still locked. Even a couple employees were trying to get in and couldn't. So we waited till 11:20 and gave up. We went to BW3 right next door, great food, great service, and they open when they said they would."}
{"text":"Terrible. I was told it was awesome. I was lied to. I even went back a second time after being told it was good by yet another person. Not by choice really. A couple we were going out with wanted to go there. So the wife and I decided to give it another chance. NOPE. I wouldn't eat here again if they paid me. YUCK! - I cant for the life of my fathom why anyone would recommend this place as good or authentic Mexican food. The food is absolutely anything but either of those. Even the salsa tastes like it came out of a can. Abuelos makes Macayos and Garcias taste gourmet. Anyone who has been to either of those two know they are horrible. I would give this place less stars if it let me. The area would serve us better if it was a hole in the ground."}
{"text":"Definitely Americanized Mexican food but hey, it works! We used to live down the street and have been here a zillion (at least) times. The menu is expansive, mid-price range and full of flavors galore. While you munch on complimentary chips and a trio of salsas, you can look at the many yummo items. 

We like the dip trio app (queso, creamy guac, and chili con queso), fajitas, Laredo & Juarez combo plates, chicken medallions and build your own enchilada plate. The papas are delish, like Mexican cheesy mashed potatoes. The refried beans and rice are really well-seasoned as well. Our picky toddler makes \"mmmmm\" grunting noises whenever he eats the food here. You KNOW it's good. If it's your first time, you can't go wrong with a combo plate, which is awesome when I'm indecisive. 

Margaritas and sangria are great and you always get your money's worth with the booze when you get them on the rocks. I was tipsy after one of the smaller size of the house margarita. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"the food is soooo goooood, at first we werent expecting the burst of flavor b/c we thought it was going to be really americanized but we were wrong. its DELICIOUS. and the place is so beautiful. in summary, food is good, the place is nice and clean, and service is friendly. probably my favorite mexican restaurant so far. OH and portions are HUGE. its a bit pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now and the service is excellent! The margaritas are a great price for what you get. I have had both the taco salad and the enchiladas - both of which were delicious! This may be a go-to! Plus, as sad as it is - I am allergic to cilantro, and they have a salsa I can eat without cilantro! They are always fast about refilling the chips too!"}
{"text":"The service was very good, food didn't taste bad. I am a big believer now that wether you go to a fancy mexican restaurant or a cheap mexican restaurant the food still tastes the same. It has a very nice atmosphere inside."}
{"text":"Olive Garden of Mexican food.  There's something really cheesy about Abuelos.  As for the food, well Espos the little run down taco shop a block away is twice as good as Abuelos.  Abuelos food is not bad but it's definitely not great."}
{"text":"One star is being generous in my opinion and only because the pre-meal chips were fresh and good.. We had a table of 8 there today. First of all my order was incorrect. I ordered a cheese enchilada and a chunky beef burro on the side. The enchilada was very small and had what appeared to be ground beef in the enchilada sauce....quite surprising! There was no lettuce and tomato garnish (which a little was provided upon request) on either item and the burro arrived enchilada style with the same sauce. As I cut into it...hmmm....where's the beef?  It was shredded chicken! The service was acceptable and I was not charged for the incorrect order which was promptly returned. Some of my group received cold beans and some said the rice was not very good either. Sorry Abulos, no return visits from any of our group or from friends and family that we can steer away from your establishment."}
{"text":"My family and I have recently been frequenting  Abuelo's for the last few months. Every time we've done here we have been in the section right next to Ryan. Well today we were lucky enough to get him as our server and from now on we will be requesting him. He is truly the diamond of this restaurant, the server you hope to get! He is funny, knowledgeable, and accommodating! I go here with my 2 kids and he gave us the same service if I was dining with 6 adults! As soon as he came to our table my daughter said \"oh yay! We finally get the funny guy!\" Because he is so entertaining. I've been waiting tables for 20 years and this man is truly remarkable! Keep up the good work Ryan! Abuelo's should truly appreciate you because FOH jobs are dime a dozen and great servers are rare!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican I've had in madison.
We always get the dip sampler and I get enchiladas a lot. Try all their flavors!!"}
{"text":"We're visiting from out of town and wanted some great local Mexican cuisine.  We were extremely disappointed on all levels. 

Cons
-Extremely large and very bright inside. We felt like we were eating in the \"Cheesecake Factory\" of Mexican restaurants. 
-The decor is reminiscent of Ceaser's Palace in Vegas.  Very grand and somewhat over the top. 
-We ordered skinny margaritas.  They arrived quickly and were not skinny and we could tell they use a jigger to measure the tequila. We could not drink these as they were too sugary.  We ordered a second round and voiced our disappointment to the waiter.  The second round was the same as the first minus the limes. 
-I ordered the two chicken enchilada combination. One with green sauce and one with red sauce. I asked the waiter if the sauces were the same that came with the chips and salsas.  He said yes and I indicated which red and green salas I preferred. He said no problem. My dinner arrived shortly and unfortunately, both were covered in red sauce. The red sauce was nothing like the salas.  

Overall, the place is very mainstream and geared towards the masses.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"I've eaten here many times with my family and the food and service has always been great. It's not receiving my restaurant coveted fifth star because I find the food selection to be on the small side. Also, the desert menu has only two deserts on it and if your not a fan of traditional Mexican desserts your out of luck. I usually order 'The Laredo' which is an enchilada dish with beans and rice it's delicious and while it is a sizable portion it's not overwhelming. The atmosphere here is lovely you aren't talking over anyone and the booths are a bit taller so you have some privacy which is a big plus for me. I hate constantly locking eyes with the person in the next booth when I'm having a conversation or chowing down! Give this place a try, I'm pretty confident you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We had a few appetizers & margaritas and it was all good.  The restaurant is open and decorated very nicely.  I would describe it as a typical, upper class Tex-Mex restaurant.  Service was good & Restaurant was clean and inviting."}
{"text":"This was my second visit here at the Madison location. I had the \"chose your own\" enchiladas platter the first time. It was overall decent but nothing special. The enchiladas are drenched in sauce and if you order ones with cheese sauce, it' overwhelming. This was the case this time when I tried the enchiladas de Cozumel. They are listed under the Seafood section but the enchiladas are filled with guacamole and topped with a couple pieces of shrimp, scallops, and drenched with cheese sauce. It really wasn't my thing.

The side vegetables were steamed and delicious. They provided a much needed relief from the cheese sauce. The rice was white rice with some cilantro and also mixed well provided from extra flavor. Overall I was a little disappointed with this dish. My friend had the fajitas tacos and they looked pretty good.

My favorite thing about this restaurant are the chips and salsa. They provide a trio of salsa, a chipotle flavor medium, a green mild, and a hot. All of them taste great with the hot being my favorite. The mild one had a bit too much garlic but was still delicious. The chips are light and crunchy (not the thick ones). I like these better although occasionally you'll break the chip in the salsa.

The service was great and the atmosphere is clean and casual."}
{"text":"Service and atmosphere is good.  Prices are a bit steep but the food is good."}
{"text":"mid-afternoon is definitely different than dinner. still tasted good.

we usually get the layered dip, it's totally messy and not as good as i think it should be, but i like it anyhow.

i get the durango burro and matt gets some combo monstrosity.

service is...meh, average. queso is tasty."}
{"text":"Their \"street tacos\" taste identical to Taco Bell soft tacos. Service wasn't great... waited approximately 15 mins for our drink order (wasn't even that busy, we were seated right away). In my opinion it's just a much more expensive version of Taco Bell - which I'm not a fan of."}
{"text":"The best Mexican restaurant round, service has always been prompt and pleasant. For Jeff's edification the statue is of Grandfather and grandchild hence the Name Abuelos (Grand father).
One of our favorite restaurants, and great Location, right next to the Ballpark"}
{"text":"Alright for a don-pablos like tex-mex restaurant.  Nice interior.  Good for taking the parent's who enjoy the dan pablos-esqe restaurants."}
{"text":"The place is amazing in it's look inside. Like Janet said you could have a wedding here it is so nice. 

The food was average. If they can step up the quality of food I would return and return again. 

The service was good when I went. They were nice and polite."}
{"text":"This was our first time visiting Abuelos, in fact we had never even heard of it. We arrived @7:45 on a Monday evening. There were a number of people waiting to be seated. However, because there were only two of us and we were more than willing to sit at a high-top in the bar area we were seated immediately. Our waitress arrived promptly to take our drink order and deliver a small tray of tortilla chips along with three small salsas. The chips were greasy but also incredibly light. There was a bland chunk tomato salsa, a spicy roasted salsa which I enjoyed, and slightly sweet green salsa.

When the waitress delivered our margaritas, she took our food order and asked if we cared for me chips. We did, so time she brought a larger basket of chips as well as bowls of each of the salsas. The margaritas were good.

For my entree I had the pork tenderloin abragada. It came with papas con chile and charro beans. The beans were good and the papas which were mashed potatoes with peppers and cheese were delicious. The pork was intensely smokey and incredible. My dining companion had enchiladas, refried beans, and mexican rice. Tasty but not exceptional. Because we had so many chips we asked for a box for the leftovers.

For lunch the next day, I heated up the leftovers and I thought the port was even better.

I would be happy to eat here again."}
{"text":"The happy hour is awesome prices and the food on the list are good selections and very good portions. It was good for all of us even my niece who's only 10."}
{"text":"Service and food not too good!   Food not tasteful, server messed up appetizer order and did take it off the bill.   Didn't really feel she cared.  The place is beautiful but the food not good"}
{"text":"This place is better at being a bar than a restaurant. Food is mediocre at best."}
{"text":"We decided to try this restaurant based solely on Yelp reviews. What a treasure!!! Thanks to my fellow Yelpers for their reviews & photos!

The ambiance of this restaurant is terrific! The menu is varied and the food delicious! It is priced a little higher than a Chili's type restaurant, but it is worth it!

The service was friendly, and the also have an elegant bar area.

I would recommend this establishment to family and friends. A solid 5 stars!!!"}
{"text":"Nice place always enjoy the bar area. Great selections of wines and ofcourse great Mexican food. The atmosphere is very nice and everyone is very friendly . Will definitely come back. Would definately recommend this place. 
Thx

{"text":"I'm a person for whom bad service can \"break\" any meal.  In the service category Abuelo's did not disappoint.  On our weekday lunchtime visit we were seated quickly,  our chips and salsa arrived within two minutes, and our server appeared just a moment behind.  Initially my daughter declined appetizers so we could actually eat our lunch, but I couldn't resist - ordering Spring Rolls from the tapas section and a Shrimp Cocktail from the \"regular\" appetizer list.  The Spring Rolls were \"eh,\" (and I wouldn't order them again) but the Shrimp Cocktail was amazing and actually the most tasteful item of those ordered.  It consisted of at least a dozen shrimp, and was served in a huge margarita glass with pita chips on the side.  It was definitely a sharable amount for four people, but the two of us ate it all and were then too full for our \"real\" lunch.  Within 5 minutes of presenting our volcano hot entrees, our server returned asking if we'd like a box for leftovers.  Two full plates came home.  Reheated Mexican food is never good but we made an attempt for dinner...yuck.  Although this is hard to admit, next time I'll do as my daughter says and just order lunch sans appetizers (Daughter = 1 / Mom = 0).  The food looked good, and on our next visit, we'll eat it."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants. Chips & salsa are amazing. We always order some  to go too. Chicken zucchini is very tasty. Great service, large portions and reasonable prices. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Went with the family to Abuelos on Chandler Blvd for dinner. Everyone loved the food. Drinks were powerful. Our server Britani was wonderful. She was knowledgeable of the food, ingredients and the garnishments. I recommend eating the yellow guadito pepper, especially if you like it spicy. From the chips & queso with the sweet green salsa to the Talapia Veracruz, the food was very delightful and satisfying. Portion sizes were comparable to its pricing.
If you're in Chandler, AZ stop in and try it."}
{"text":"The food quality and taste is great. They installed a new service screen at the table were you may order and pay!"}
{"text":"Papas con chile (mashed potatoes with cheese and jalapenos) is not what one expects to find on the menu at an average Mexican restaurant.  But Abuelo's is not average - it's way above.  Lovely rooms filled with paintings and murals.  Between the four of us, we tried carnitas street tacos, chili rellenos with meat, chicken quesadilla, carnitas enchilada with red sauce, and spinich enchilada with cream sauce.  Plus papas con chile, refried beans, and whole beans.  All four of us were very satisfied - and full.  The complimentary chips are very light and crispy and come with a typical red salsa and also a hotter green salsa.  The only reason I give it a 4 instead of a 5 is that I want to come back and try their well-known seafood dishes and see what they are like.  They also have a prime rib special on Thursday nights."}
{"text":"Went there for our first time last month. We were surprised at the sparseness of the people in the restaurant compared to the overflowing parking lot.  We advised the server that we were on a SHORT break and had to get back to the nearby hospital shortly, she indicated that she understood. 
   One of my favorite foods to have at a Mexican restaurant is Tamales.  There were shockingly NONE listed anywhere on the menu!!  When I questioned the server about it, she told me that they had them but they were no it listed on the menu and were made by request only.  Now I know that when we get together to make Tamales, it is NOT a 'quick' thing to make, so I was quite surprised that they were going to make these quickly.  
   My Husband ordered Enchiladas and our friends ordered the chicken mole and a simple salad that was supposed to have avocados and fresh fruit on it!  The salad had none of that when it arrived!!  We had an extensive delay in our food arrival, almost 45 minutes after ordering. Now I had told the waitress that if my ordering Tamales 'off menu' was going to delay our meal, that I needed to reconsider depending on how much extra time it would take. She was quite insistent that there would be no additional delay in our order because of the tamales.  
    Once our food was finally served, it was cool and EVERY person had at least one issue (besides fact food was cold!!) With their meal!!  Mine was dry, no flavor, minimal seasonings and flat tasting beans and rice, bad since I had ordered specialty potatoes and vegetables as my sides. I had to ask THREE times for sour cream and the guacamole that was supposed to come with my meal. By the time it finally arrived my food had gone from cool to flat out right cold!!  My husbands enchiladas were unimaginative and extremely basic. For the money they were charging, I expected more than I could get at a fast food type setting!!  The chicken dinner just had wrong sides, but he said it tasted OK. My friends' salad was supposed to have avocado and fresh fruit on it. No avocados (bad since it was part of the title of the salad!!) and the fruit was shriveled up and dried out, what little there was of it!  There was a lot of iceberg lettuce though! 
   Overall the inexcusable slow service, in an uncrowded restaurant, with multiple errors in getting the correct food and sides all out at the same time and HOT;  with a server having an attitude of \"too bad, so sad\" ruined what should have been a nice and pleasant diversion from a stressful situation (the hospital family member ill).  Then top that off with mediocre quality of food that was worse than many fast food places, we should have just eaten next door at Olive Garden where I know the food and service are at least average to above average. What a waste of $100 (no booze or appetizers!!)!!"}
{"text":"We went to your Chandler, AZ yesterday for Fathers Day at about 5:00PM. I called ahead at 3:30 to check best seating times. We arrived just before 5 and were immediately seated. After sitting for a few minutes we noted that it was a very warm in the restaurant. We were brought our drinks in a timely fashion and ordered. It became even more obvious that there was an AC issue at the restaurant and I asked the waiter who stated that they started having AC issues at about Noon. We went ahead and had our meal which I really don't remember eating because we were all suffering from the heat in the restaurant which must have been 100F. Waiter said yeah, sorry... but you should see how hot the kitchen is. Like we really were concerned with the kitchen. By the time we left the restaurant had filled up and we were leaving drenched in sweat.
          I asked to see the manager at the front desk before we left and she promptly came out. I advised her that all of her customers were miserable and why had she not been seen for the whole time we were there (little over an hour). She stated that she was working on getting the AC fixed.         
          I just wanted to share this and let you know that if I do not receive some kind of positive feedback (which I did not receive at the restaurant) from corporate I will never return or recommend your company again. We've been enjoying your restaurant for over 10 years here. That manager should have been on the floor interfacing with the customers and offering discounts or even refunds. And she definitely should have had the matrode/greeter warning customers at the door (if not closing the doors for new diners).

So what really pissed me off was that I well called well before driving the 30 miles to the restaurant and nobody said a word of warning.

And yes, our son dropped $80 on his first time taking me out for a fathers day meal (with his first pay check), and he felt HE had to apologize to me. 

Horrible, horrible, horrible manager.


We typically had very nice meals at Abuelo's.


UPDATE: I was called very quickly by Abuelos today after sending an email and yelping. The restaurant owns their errors in communications and resoution when they had issues yesterday and are trying to make things right with their customers that suffered through the meal yesterday. Though I can't bring myself to go above 3 Stars, I do bump it up to a 3 Star review from a 1 Star review for their rapid response. Thank you for doing the right thing Chris. We will return :-)

Final Update: Chris came through with some credit to dine here again. We returned recently and enjoyed our experience and will probably return in the not too distant future."}
{"text":"our experience with this restaurant was spectacular. Fajita and taco dishes were all good. Server was very attentive and complimentary chips and salsa were awesome."}
{"text":"Such a good meal! Abuelo's really has hospitality down to a science. Went there for lunch, I am pretty sure I'll go back and try their dinner. Try all of their salsas they are soooo good! Also, I was impressed with their vegetarian menu and all the options they have available to us."}
{"text":"I had high hopes from this place, I really did.  Sadly, my new favorite mexican place is not going to be this one.

We arrived a little after the dinner rush on Sunday and the place was packed.  We were seated almost immediately, which was kind of a surprise, considering how full it looked.  The waiter eventually ventured over and asked for our drinks.  Now, to be honest, we weren't really prepared to order yet, but after dropping off some water, we didn't see the waiter again for at least another 7-10 minutes.  Come on, we weren't ready then, but it doesn't take THAT long to figure out a drink order.  On top of that, the drinks didn't show up until the food was coming out.

Anyway, after that lovely wait for anything beyond a single glass of water, I was pretty thirsty for my drink (their take on a long island, which turned out just to be....a long island [and not a good one, at that]).  My companions food, chicken quesadillas came out looking very pretty.  My chorizo stuffed chicken medallions; far less so.  To start, my plate had other food debris on it.  Apparently wiping off the plates as you hand them out isn't a priority.  Then again, neither is quick turn around because my beans and mashed potato sides had that lovely \"I've been in the window too long and got cooked\" film on them. Yuck.  The chicken itself was overcooked and dry, relying too much on the breading and the oily chorizo stuffing to cover for a terminal lack of taste in the chicken.

Anyway, based on the rave reviews, I'd consider going back if someone had their heart set on it, but I don't think this is a place I'll suggest again."}
{"text":"my dad gave me an old gift card for Abuelos that looked like it'd been around for 100 years. We had never been before so we thought we would give it a shot. My dad really missed out and should have kept his gift card. We had an amazing time and everything was perfect. The manager greeted us at the door, hostess took right to our table, server was quick and very friendly, food was fantastic, and we could not have had a better experience. there is a lot of great Mexican food in the area but Abuelos is definitely a contender."}
{"text":"On the day that a took my daughter there the weather was bad and they were very slow.
We were seated immediately and had our order taken very quickly. We ordered the queso and it was mediocre at best. I can make better queso with Rotel and Velveeta. Our waitress stood at the hostess stand talking to the hostess the entire meal we were her only table so when our drinks ran empty multiple times and stayed empty for 15 minutes I was a little unhappy about that.The fajitas were eh okay and my daughter seemed to enjoy her meal. I will not be returning to eat here again"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!!! Best Mexican food I've had in AZ! Go for happy hour the drinks and food are crazy cheep! Make sure you sit at the bar for the happy hour prices!+ the bartenders Megan and Devin are great!"}
{"text":"The walk in has enough room for a party of 15 or so to congregate and the wood finish throughout the restaurant makes you feel a little cozy.  Since I was just a party of one, I sat at the bar, and was served by a very friendly bartender.  I was able to watch ESPN and keep up on my football talk.  You get corn chips and 3 different salsa types- I tried the green tomatilo which was very tasty a very mild salsa, and the red salsa which had a little bit of heat but I didn't touch the browner looking salsa. For my meal, I got the Yucatan Shrimp Fajitas, it was as sweet savory BBQ shrimp.  I had the lunch special version so my size was smaller.  I didn't mind that but they kept the amount of green pepper and onions at the same amount as the smaller version.  Instead of a tortilla, I used the lettuce wrap which allowed me to have a fresh taste.  I also substituted the beans(rice?) with their Spinach casserole, which was a creamy fabulous mix!  I enjoyed the meal but it was a little pricy.  It was a good treat for me."}
{"text":"Been here many times. The place can be a zoo in the late afternoon/early evening so avoid those times if at all possible. People will literally stand behind your chair in the bar area to grab the seat of a departing customer.
The \"frozen\" house margaritas are the standout of this restaurant, though they can vary in tartness/sweetness from week to week. Either way, they always pack a punch. They're pricey too, but after a few it won't matter much.
Their food is consistently good to very good, but nothing spectacularly delicious. Their pork tenderloin abrigada (medallions) has always been one of my favorites.
Overall, it's a nice place to visit on occasion, especially for a date, but be sure to go either early or really late or you'll be fighting the crowds. And be sure to stuff a couple extra $20s in your wallet for good measure. This place is not exactly cheap."}
{"text":"Good Mexican food. Very nice place to grab a bite to eat. It's located in a great area and close to the Marriott. The staff was very friendly and was quick to refill drinks which is very important to me."}
{"text":"If you enjoy authentic Tex Mex food this is the place for you. Unfortunately it is not as close as we would like to have it, but we do attempt to visit as often as possible. My husband ordered the House Specialty, Los Mejores de la Casa which is the best of the house! Fire-grilled, bacon-wrapped beef tenderloin medallions and bacon-wrapped shrimp stuffed with fresh jalapeño and blended cheeses. All I can say is WOW. The steak was tender having a wonderful seasoning to it. I ordered the the Grande Tex Mex which is three enchiladas - one beef, one cheese and one sour cream chicken - a cheese chile relleno, tamale, crispy beef taco and guacamole. This sounds like a lot of food which it is, but we always order more so we can take these delicious meals home and enjoy them again. Our server Jaime was most pleasant and made certain he was on top of drinks, etc. The décor and atmosphere is absolutely wonderful."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful dinner with great friends Jerry and Maggie. Service was excellent. Looking forward to returning soon. Even ran into our friend Anna Shaw who bought us some bread pudding for her birthday. Great to see you. All in all, a good night."}
{"text":"5 star Margarita ( try Sangria Swirl) 
3 star average food
5 star service at the Bar!!!! I asked for veggie sticks which was not on the menu vs chips and the bartender cut them up for me.  Great Happy Hour menu before 7 pm"}

{"text":"We went to Abuelo's for the first time this evening for a relative's birthday. The food and service was really great! Huge portions. Our server, Heather, was great! She gave us chips with salsa and guacamole to-go at no extra cost! We would definitely like to come back again in the future :)"}
{"text":"This My favorite place to eat everything I like friendly staff always a good time something new different on the menu and the Kia's easy to check in and out of say I want dessert or say I want to drink very convenientAnd appetizer or something different"}
{"text":"First experience. Not real busy, yet service at the bar started slow. It did improve though. Chips and salsa were good. Had shrimp fajita on lettuce wraps rather than tortilla shells. Was really good! Drinks were well made also. Price was pretty much the normal range I would expect for this level of establishment. 
Check got my attn though. Normally it suggests tip amounts for 10,15, and 20%. This check offered suggestions for 15, 20, and 25%. Sorry, but I will never increase my bill by a quarter of its value! That's nuts! Where does it stop? When we pay double? I tipped 15% because service was not perfect, but decent... So tip is decent as well. I will eat here again for sure. 

Update: Mike, I am a business traveler. I stay at Aloft near your location from time to time. Saw the restaurant and looked on yelp at reviews. I am on the road 4-5 days a week, so most meals are at dining establishments. Consider myself a tough critic as I have a lot to compare my experiences to. I love to try local and new places... Not chains and I don't eat fast food. Was very impressed with decor, food, drinks, and for the most part the service. No offense by the tip stuff. Just shocked. Eating it 15-20 meals a week...I had never seen a 25% suggestion... Even art 5 star establishments. I tip well, but rarely 20% unless the experience is flawless. That rarely happens. LOL 
I will be back to see you guys on my next stay at Aloft."}
{"text":"I heart Abuelo's.  I'll just start by saying that I initially thought this was going to be an expensive restaurant so hadn't stepped into it until I went with co-workers.  I ordered (and still do) the kid's bean/cheese burrito - very inexpensive and yummy.  The thing I like is that the beans have a peppery taste to them so it's not bland.  
The one thing that keeps me coming back is the chips and salsa.   It's not unusual for me and my lunch buddies to go through 2 bowls of chips and 2 bowls of salsa EACH before we even give our order to the waiter/waitress. I think they put something in it to make you crave it.  
For the price and atmosphere - I can only comment on my kids menu choice ($6) and the lunch crowd (not too busy)."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like it, but what are they going for here. The salsas weren't good and we tried the Papas con Chile, not good at all. Never going back."}
{"text":"We came here for reverse happy hour and we were told that they don't have reverse happy hour, but their website states that they do."}
{"text":"If I had to choose between Garcia's, Macayo's, La Parilla Suiza (here in Phoenix) and Abuelo's... I'd choose Abuelo's before all the other places. Why? Simply because for a chain establishment, the food offered is quite good, and the prices comparable. 

I tend to go for the seafood choices of Abuelo's I've had the Pescado Guerrero and the Enchiladas de Cozumel. Both entrees are good, the Pescado Guerrero is a mahi-mahi steak with fresh shrimp,
scallops, mushrooms, spinach, roasted peppers and sliced
avocado in a delicious white wine sauce. It's delicious, the mahi-mahi isn't fishy at all, and the accompaniment of the roasted peppers with the sliced avocado balances the dish. As for the Enchiladas de Cozumel, it is crepes filled with fresh guacamole, covered
in a rich white wine sauce with a medley of perfectly seasoned
shrimp, scallops, mushrooms, fresh spinach and roasted peppers, the dish is similar to the Pescado Guerrero hence why I like both. 

Another plus for Abuelo's are its tortilla chips and salsa. The tortilla are so crisp that they're quite addictive, and the salsa is not overtly spicy, and has a thick consistency. Something that I do enjoy. So, if you have a hankering for some Mexican, I suggest you try Abuelo's if there's a location near you, it's worth it and I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!"}
{"text":"This was good when it first opened but is now indistinguishable from the Americanized greasy spoon Mexican fare that you get everywhere else in Phoenix. 

Prices are okay, chips and salsa are included (and the chips are served warm) and the portions are enormous. But the food isn't particularly interesting, relying too heavily on fat and carbs and not enough on interesting flavors.

Every time I go, want Abuelo's to be a classy Mexican restaurant that distinguishes itself through a refined Mexican palate not a substitute for Macayo's."}
{"text":"They start you with tortilla chips that are thin and light, with 3 salsas. The food was very good. I had the Pork Tenderloin Abrigada, the pork tenderloin medallions  (3) wrapped in bacon, very flavorful, with a smokey, grilled taste. It also comes with (2) enchiladas that are covered with a type sauce that will enhance the type enchilada chosen. The service was slow and attention to detail was limited. The food took a bit long to be served, but I would come back to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Yes this is a chain Mexican Restaurant.  But I find it better than South of the Border or other such fare.  It seems a step ahead of the other chains.  

There seems to be a bit more inspiration with the dishes then the typical beef enchilada en red sauce.

For example Spinach enchiladas or bacon wrapped shrimp.  Or even the salsa choices are bit different.  

We went with a party of 6 On Sunday lunch.   No problem getting seated, though they were busy.  I have to admit our waitress while very nice was a bit slow on the take.  would constantly bring me a new iced tea, but never removed the empty glasses.  At one point we bussed our own table to prepare to make room for the entrees.  Oh yeah, one of our entrees did not show up with the rest.  It took about 15 minutes for the kitchen to get that one steak out.  Credit to the manager who took it off our bill.  

We paid with $25 gift cards bought at Costco for $20 each.  Worked very easily.

there is more than enough food per person.  No one even thought of ordering dessert. 

In the past we have had the Margaritas and they were not as sweet as some places sell, which for us was a big plus.  though they tasted just like the Kirkland Costco 'Golden Margaritas\" (which we buy and love).

All in all, for a group with more Conservatives Mexican food tastes, this is a safe bet.  Way too much to choose from, which means everyone will get something they will like.  

As for the wife and I, we continue our quest for more authentic more adventurous Mexican food in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Visited several weeks ago and enjoyed it so we are back at again.  Had the stuffed chicken medallions which is one of my favorites at Abuelo's and always much better with a couple of margarita's."}
{"text":"I came here during happy hour with a few of my coworkers on Monday. We ordered our drinks first thinking we'd get them right away since we sat right by the bar. They ended up bringing our drinks after we got our food. I could also tell that the drinks had been sitting awhile since my frozen margarita had already melted at the bottom. Aside from that incident, the drinks were quite tasty and strong.

As for the food, I ordered the chile con queso dip, happy hour nachos, and jalapeño cheese fritters. The dip turned out to be really good. I was a little hesitant after reading some reviews, but ordered it anyway since it was free. The nachos weren't bad at all. I just wished the toppings were evenly distributed over the nachos and more meat wouldn't hurt either. I'll be ordering double meat, if there is a next time. I was a little disappointed with the jalapeño cheese fritters as they were just too cheesy and salty. Don't get me wrong, I love cheese, but it just over powered the jalapeños. All in all, my tab ended up being $22, not bad.

The service was good. The server disappeared for a short period of time so it took a little longer to get what we needed at first. When she was at our table, she was very accommodating and attentive. I did like the little monitors on each table. It made the process of paying a little easier. I think you could also order from them. Overall, I think Abuelo's is pretty decent. I'd probably only come here for happy hour though since some of their regular items are a bit pricey."}
{"text":"They have the outside and inside of the restaurant decorated lavishly, but that's probably to make up for their less than mediocre food. I ordered a cheese quesadilla, and it left much to be desired. The chips were also nothing special. Nobody else in my party enjoyed their food either."}
{"text":"I love their super thin chips and the salsa is great. The food is good for a chain and the service is terrific.

I love their guacamole cream and their flan and Tres Leche is to die for!"}
{"text":"We specifically come to eat here whenever we are visiting Phoenix as we live out of town. It is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants in the country. The enchiladas are absolutely incredible."}
{"text":"The restaurant is beautifully designed but the food was sadly uninspired. The shrimp chowder was the only item we had that was seasoned as we would have expected. Everything else was ok but lacked seasoning as would be expected of Mexican cuisine. Now of course looking at the much older clientele they had it may not appeal to their tastes and that may be why everything was kind of bland"}
{"text":"FRI-SAT,....PACKED!! PACKED!!
But they can handle it!! Great food, great service, Great atmosphere.
I had Fideo con Pollo and it was good!! Fun place for sure!!"}
{"text":"On Tuesday 1/03/2017, we stopped into our favorite \"Mexican\" restaurant for lunch. The reason why I used \" \" is Mexican restaurants in AZ are Americanized. Abuelo's is one of the best as we dine here often. We arrived before Noon and ordered Guac Appetizer and two orders of Chile Rellenos + soft drinks as it was early in the day. We love their thin and warm chips with Salsa. Service is always great and attentive. The restrooms are always clean and checked often"}
{"text":"Finally gave into my temptation and tried this place for my birthday, with age things get better right? It's a franchise place, nice inside, good for groups, kind of like an Olive Garden feel inside with a Mexican twist. 

We got a free queso dip for checking in on Yelp ! HOLLERRRR. It was so yummy, full of chiles and spices they went perfect together. 

I had the shrimp fajitas,unlimited guac?! I'm soooo in there. They came out steaming hot, with all the dressings fit to make the perfect fajita. Their cilantro lime rice is one of a kind, so flavorful. 

Because it was my bday (princess face) I got a free flan, so rich and creamy, so sweet and succulent. I was impressed.

I gave them 4 stars however because for one the place has NO ventilation so I was legit sweating my face off, and second the waiter was a bit rude, kind of rushed us, and didn't even offer to refill our drinks unless we asked him. 

Overall it was a good dinner, great price, great portions and a nice get away from my usual franchise spots!"}
{"text":"Abuelo's is a unique Mexican restaurant.  

It's not the \"You're the only one speaking English authentic\" type of restaurant.  It's also not a Taco Bell.

It's somewhere in between.  The typical mariachi-band is upgraded to Spanish language contemporary pop music.  The salsa portion of the expected chips and salsa appetizer are upgraded to a mix-your-own mild, sweet, and hot salsas.  I get the feel that it's a Roman-esque type of grandeur, yet it's a typical Mexican restaurant.   

My wife had the fajita tacos.  I had a combo platter that included an enchilada among other typical fare.  

As for the quality, I give Abuelo's credit for making a leap to gourmet type Mexican food.  It's a healthy step above the crummy ingredients and composition you'd find at cheaper places in town.  But it's also not Earth-shattering \"ohmygodthisisthebestplaceihaveeverbeentoever!!\" 

I was very pleased with the service.  Our food and drinks arrives without haste, and our server was on top of the chips and salsa situation.  

Abuelo's is a fine choice if you're in the mood for mexican and not wanting the typical bargain-basement type of mexican fare.  More importantly, the atmosphere and the service is what puts it above other restaurants of it's type."}
{"text":"We had lunch here today and we will be back. The decor is very attractive and our server, Josiah, was great. We're both vegetarians and Josiah was helpful in  making suggestions that fit the bill. 

My wife ordered the avocado enchiladas with Ranchera sauce. She enjoyed her meal, but she did say she would order the crema sauce next time. I ordered the avocado enchiladas with crema sauce and it is a new favorite. Interestingly, the avocado enchiladas aren't made with tortillas. They're actually made using crepes, which made them delicate and light.  The papas are indescribably good and the black beans we substituted were fresh and tasty. Josiah made sure the black beans were vegetarian-friendly, which we really appreciated. 

The meal was capped off with some of the best flan I've ever had. Be sure to leave room for it."}
{"text":"I can't believe I have no review here! We come here a lot, hubby loves the huevos rancheros, don't think I've ever had a bad meal here. The servers are always great, even when they are busy! The manager even helps out! Everything is always hot! More salsa and chips, no problem! Some things on menu can be pricey, but plenty of other good things to choose from! Lunch menu is a good value plus is available to Seniors all day! Nice portion size as well, I recommend you try it for yourself!"}
{"text":"Save room Get the Flan! I would stop for dessert if I could. I chips are my favorite. This is 1st with me, #2 is the salsa, and the green salsa I could drink! that is how yummo it is. Everything is alway great, Abuelos is always my go to place when I want Mexican TexMex. I take out of towner here too."}
{"text":"Really good food,not your typical taco/tostada meal. Service was good,refills plentiful,along with a good happy hour. A bit on the pricey side,but worth it. 

Just left there an hour ago for our anniversary,the food was fabulous,but the best part of our evening was our waiter Jose. What a delightful individual he was. Going to ask for him every time we go back.  Thanks for a wonderful evening"}
{"text":"The only difference between Abuelos food and Taco Bell is the price.  I ordered the bean & cheese burrito and there was no difference in taste or quality of ingredients from TB. Yuck!"}
{"text":"Here are the facts: we were there on a Wednesday, nearby bus boy dropped glass cups twice. One hit my friends foot and another tiny piece of glass flew into my boyfriend's eye. The manager was sweet. He didn't charge us for our entire check because of the mishaps. Random-the plates a burning hot. & Margaritas are great!! Fun margarita mixes!! I would definitely come again for the yummy Mexican food and the beautiful interior design of the restaurant! I would definitely come back for the margaritas!!!"}
{"text":"Abuelo is old favorite for me that started in the Midwest and I am so glad they have location in the Valley! The menu is little different but one thing that is familiar is chips and salsa 

You must try all three.. My favorite is the green one but be cautious of the hot one that's little chunkier. The chips compliment the salsa very well, very thin and light. Chips and salsa are nice nice way to start the meal"}
{"text":"I have been a fan of Abuelo's since I discovered it in Colorado in the late 1990's. Their food is consistently delicious for a chain type American restaurant. I was pleased to find this Chandler location and have come here at least a half a dozen times. The building, decor and dining experience is excellent. The service has always been superb and friendly. The salsa is good and I enjoy the enchiladas. You should come to this restaurant for those reasons. If you want truly \"authentic\" Mexican food then book a US Airways Flight to Puerto Vallarta or dine in a hole in the wall restaurant in South Phoenix but then B.Y.O.G (Bring Your Own Glock)"}
{"text":"Ok...I know we live in Arizona...and have alot of great authentic Mexican restaurants around...that being said....I frequent Abuelos about once every two weeks....be it with co workers or with my wife. I give this place 5 stars.....

I know it's a chain but I think the food is tasty...the ambience is really very nice too. Relatively speaking its cheap too. I think their chips and salsa are pretty good. I usually judge Mexican restaurants based on their chili rellenos they have two kinds one filled with cheese and the other shredded beef...both are delicious. 

They have the standard rice and beans that most Mexican restaurants serve with everything...but they have an option called \"papas con chili\" ...imagine a cheesy mashed potato casserole...I don't think Mexican when I request it with the rice because I'm not a big fan of beans....but I still think it tastes good.

I recommend this place if your looking for a good bite! I've probably been here a total of 15 times or so...and have never had a poor experience."}
{"text":"I have dined in at Abuelo's once and eaten their take-out at least three times.  I have to admit, this restaurant doesn't do much for me. I think this is because I'm a vegetarian and there just isn't much on the menu for me.   Tonight I had their cheese and onion enchiladas, which were perfectly fine...but I wasn't wowed. Why then, you ask, am I giving them a 4-star review? Well, because it seems as though everyone else who has dined with me has really enjoyed their food. I have not heard a single complaint from anyone else who has eaten at Abuelo's. Their chips and salsa are great - the chips are light and airy with the perfect amount of salt and the salsas taste very fresh and, as a person who doesn't love salsa, I think they are pretty awesome.  My friend who was born and raised in Mexico said everything he tried was really flavorful and good - he clearly knows better than I do.  When I dined in, our server was wonderful, a funny young man (that makes me sound really old) who was did a great job with a bunch of half drunk 30-something women. So, while Abuelo's probably wouldn't be MY first pick of a dinner restaurant, it has proven time and time again that it is, overall, a quality restaurant for those who have more choices on the menu."}
{"text":"Great food & plenty of it.  Our waitress Jade was awesome!!!!  Ask for her section."}
{"text":"We came here to enjoy dinner and was very disappointed in the quality of food and service. This place used to be a jewel great food and exceptional quality. Today was the complete opposite. The beans were dry and crusty, it was very apparent that they over microwaved the plate they didn't even bother doing it before the salad was added to the dish the lettuce was shriveled and dry. Don't understand why if you have a good thing they change it . Will definitely not be coming back again. Been a long time customer but no more."}
{"text":"Excellent service by damaris - food was excellent - we had chimichangas, enchiladas, grandpas favorite and pork tenderloin - everything was wonderful - chips and salsa were excellent as well as the queso dip and the bacon wrapped shrimp!  Highly recommend this place for upscale Mexican and tex-mex - great value!  Mucho gracias!!!  P.S make sure you get the potatoes as a side - the best mashed hot potatoes you could ask for!"}
{"text":"Took my mom and friends to Abuelos when they wanted Tex Mex. Thursday's they have drink and a prime rib special ... if it's a party of two, I recommend one person order the prime rib and the other ask for the steak that's wood-fired and not on the menu any more but still serve it if you ask...It's delicious . Steak at a Tex mex joint? Yup!"}
{"text":"This place is a five star for fab food especially tex mex and great wait staff and superior service! Great taste and atmosphere .... Be sure to ask for Nina for your waitress, she gave us great great customer svc!  Tell her Wayne told ya to request her! -cheers! -Wayne ;-)"}
{"text":"The restaurant is nice. Food is good, use to be better. Loved the chicken chimi. However it has changed and not as good. Chips and salsa are always on point. The best thing here that has remained the same...the Flan. Creamy and delicious. If you go make sure you get this. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Expensive and crowded when I went. Slow service, nonexistent refills. 

Damn it. I wanted to like Abuelo's more, since I had gone there years back and remember a great meal with friends. This time, the entire city of Peoria decided to show up there to eat. My girlfriend and I did have to wait a bit before they could find a seat for us. 

Our sever was a nice guy, very focused on all of the tables he had. Unfortunately, this also meant that we would only get drink refills sparsely throughout the night. This included our waters as well, which was disappointing. 

For dinner, my girl had the salmon and rice. I had enchiladas and pork tenderloin. Both of us were impressed with our food. My plate was amazing. But that did come at a price. So with the price and lack of service considered, this was an average experience. 

I'm not mad or anything, I can't say whether or not I would come back. It's a long shot to be honest."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. Very nice decor and ambiance. 

My wife and I took our daughter here for her 7th birthday lunch after going to the mall. They even gave her a free desert. 

Avocado enchiladas were to die for. Not the cheapest prices but well worth it."}
{"text":"We had a great experience dinning here tonight, Mike our server was excellent, he was very attentive in keeping our drinks and chips full. He brought our food very quickly and kept asking us if all was ok. Mike is very personable and he made our dining experience a pleasurable experience. The food was great as usual, I had the prime rib, which is only a Thursday night special, this is the best prime rib I have eaten out here, great taste. My wife had the Grande, the plate was the biggest plate I have ever seen, she has enough for another dinner. We always have a great dining experience here."}
{"text":"Myself and 2 co-workers and another g/f had a holiday lunchon at Abuelos on 12/16/2015 and we had an awesome time.  We stayed in the corner bar for hours.  Food was yummy and the beer cold.  We played the trivia game and that was fun too.  Christopher Lopez the Proprietor is great, understanding patient and helpful.  I lost my receipt for my expense reimbursement and he was nice enough to print one for me today.  Go Chris you rock!"}
{"text":"Took a guest to Abuelo's for dinner. I was very embarrassed. First off, the atmosphere was nice. Very unique! Our service was great but there was not a lot of people there. The chips were good but the salsa tasted like they squirted Macayo's taco sauce into a bowl and called it fresh!( My guest came up with this comparison!)  

My guest had a steak fajita chimi plate that came with rice and beans. The presentation was gorgeous! The cheese sauce on top tasted like the canned Nacho cheese sauce you might get at a state fair. In fact...my guest said that was all he could taste! The refried beans were very bland. No lard for sure! The rice resembled a Chinese fried rice which was just weird!  He hated it so much that he didn't eat much. 

I had the steak Fajita's which were supposed to be marinated.(NOT)! It was over cooked(some spots were even burnt and crunchy) fatty cheap steak. My guess, Flank or Skirt steak! The veggies under it were not Mexican! They consisted of broccoli, zucchini, yellow squash, a few peppers and a lot of onions. It was served with a bowl of pinto beans. They were soupy and tasted like liquid smoke! I didn't eat much of my dinner either! 

I have traveled many places and dined in many exquisite establishments. This in no way resembled Mexican or Spanish cuisine in any way.  Just gross and VERY over priced!

{"text":"The chile con queso sauce was ok not a lot of flavor and I expected there to be meat with the cheese as there is in authentic Mexican restaurants. Ordered the Jalapeño cheese bits the were very good and are served with a creamy ranch dipping sauce. The food was mediocre, the beans were over cooked hard on top."}
{"text":"Customer service and atmosphere were great but the food was tasteless. 

We had enchiladas and something with beans."}
{"text":"I always feel like I'm in the twilight zone when I read reviews about this or the neighboring PF Changs. It's literally only about atmosphere and the drinks. The food is beyond bland in my opinion for the price. I've tried the various meatless enchiladas, bean burrito and vegetable fajitas - the fajitas were OK but everything else was incredibly bland( I don't even know how you can make a cheese enchilada bland but somehow it is.)  So again - Atmosphere, Service and Drinks is what this place is all about."}
{"text":"Great place, Great food!

Try their Shredded Beef Chile Relleno dish."}
{"text":"Pricey for what you get, food nothing out of the ordinary, best part of the meal was great chips and salsas."}
{"text":"Abuelos is out of our way but we go for the flavor as often as possible.  The tacos are made from fajita steak and so tender.  The chips and salsa are divine and the margaritas are always perfectly mixed.  YUM!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here and had their burrito, asked for the potatoes and beans on the side, the meal was very filling and tasty.  The burrito was filled with meat and def cheesy.  
The staff are friendly and you won't leave hungry."}
{"text":"We came here last evening, and just for a moment, we thought we were transported to Las Vegas and The Venetian (minus the gondolas). 

Abuelo's is a Mexican themed restaurant chain out of Texas. That, for the most part, works. The servings are huge... and as they say, everything is bigger in Texas. 

Abuelo's  operates a \"called ahead system\". Where if you are on your way and place your name in, you will be given the next open table after you arrive. Given it was a crowded Saturday night at six, this makes a lot of sense and saved us from sitting for forty minutes or so. Nice!

We sat in the bar area, so I have no pictures of that blue sky ceiling. The service was prompted and the wait time between menu items was small. Happy Hour runs until seven, and you get a drink size upgrade for only $0.25.

We ordered two frozen drinks, along with some water. The Margaritas were worth the trip. And then came the salsa. Hmmm. In a word, all three were pretty bland, with barely any taste. The green was a bitter, vinegary miss, with no tomatillo taste. So we sipped our drinks hoping for something better. 

Next came our three dip sampler. A chili type dip, a queso and some guacamole.  My friend Rohlin in the OC, commented recently that you go out to have something better than you yourself can make at home. Well... each was me'h and we've had better at Chili's. 

The entrées soon arrived and we thought they were pretty good. Not flavorful, just good. The portions were also huge. I purposely placed a fork on my plate to give a sense of size and scale. The plate itself must of been 15\" wide!

So in summary, we would give Abeulo's Three Stars, \"A-Okay\" -- if only for the drinks and Entrées. 

Expect to pay $30, or so each; depending on how thirsty you are. I would skip the appetizers."}
{"text":"Tasteless chips. Blandish street tacos. Beautiful restaurant. Clean. Wish the interior matched decor the flavors of the food. Disappointed. Would not waste time nor money there."}
{"text":"Update:  they changed their salsa, and now it's VERY good.  The fajitas are still great - especially the pork (it's seriously AMAZING!)."}
{"text":"Frankly, one star is even too generous for our visit recently to Abuelos at Arrowhead. What used to be a fun and delicious place to eat has dwindled down to being just an absolute dump. 

The restaurant was filthy. Someone had actually dropped one of their flossers on the floor in the lobby and the hostesses just walked by it over and over again. There was trash in the faux planters and there were actually still Christmas decorations in a couple of random spots in the faux plants surrounding the dining area. There were dirty tables that just sat dirty all around the dining area. Sorry but that's unacceptable. 

The server was friendly...sort-of. He sold us on an appetizer and then didn't bother to put it in! I think he was put out that our party of 3 decided to share the fajita trio rather than ordering 3 seperate dishes. The fajita trio is HUGE and it easily feeds our family. Our drinks were never refilled...our chip bowl sat empty so long it started to get cobwebs on it. 

Overall, this was a grossly disappointing visit to a restaurant that once was respectable, clean, and had pride. There is clearly no pride left in this Abuelos. I think I'll just stick to the dives here in El Mirage....at least they care about their customers and their reputations."}
{"text":"Got to eat here today and I just say I loved it. Everything was perfect.  The chicken fajitas are too die for.   Service was excellent.  Will be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Alfonso is a wonderful bartender.  Food is always absolutely wonderful.  Margaritas fabulous."}
{"text":"Yummy as always. We went for happy hour the bartender is the best I can't think of his name. He makes my michleladas so yummy. He has been our bartender before appreciate it him :)"}
{"text":"We love this place, its as close to Tex Mex as we have found in Phoenix. Absolutely recommend the appetizer dip trio and the fajitas. Atmosphere is awesome, especially on the patio (which is climate controlled but might still be too hot in the summer) or in the bar. The service has always been pretty good; water glasses refilled quickly as well as chips and salsa. If your looking for some decent Mexican food give it a shot. Its in a good area for going to dinner and then going out to the bar."}
{"text":"Steak fajitas were dry and bland, beans were really good. Great ambiance and service. Husband really liked the ribye and pork enchiladas."}
{"text":"Trying to be too fancy. Just because the prices are expensive doesn't mean the food is worth it. Over priced for the decor, don't be fooled."}
{"text":"I love Abuelos! The chips and salsa are very good - thin chips with several types of salsa for traditional, to spicy, to sweet and innovative.

The stuffed chicken medalists are my personal favorite as far as entrees go - white meat chicken stuffed with chorizo and fried crispy and slices.  Get them with the Papas!

Always consistent and we always leave satisfied!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure if I wanted to give 3 or 4 stars...hubby & I sat at the bar & started with a beer & a frozen swirled sangria (so good btw) they brought out chips & 3 different salsas.  We got there a little before 9pm when Happy Hour started so we waited to order the dip trio, they were great! $5 for 3 different dips is an awesome deal in my book, especially when they keep refilling chips for you.  Husband ordered a street taco & it took about 15-20 min for it to come out which was disappointing since the bar area wasn't very busy at all.  Service was a bit slow but we had a great time snacking on chips & cooling off with yummy drinks."}
{"text":"I went here with my boyfriend twice while on vacation. I went here the first day of our trip and then the last day. I loved their food choices they had everything from traditional Mexican cuisine to seafood options they even had vegetarian options so no matter what you like there is something for everyone. Their portions are pretty big, and even their soup is great, I tried the tortilla soup and it was awesome. They also offer drinks which I opted for the margarita but they literally have a full bar so you can have anything you want... The place is very beautiful so you can sit outside, inside, or at the bar. The prices are a lil bit high, dinner for 2 was around 60-80$ average plate of food is 20$ and drinks about 8$. I enjoyed my time here for sure the service was great friendly waiters they check on you often to see if your okay."}
{"text":"Abuelo's restaurant in Peoria has become our favorite in the area.  We've never had a bad meal or poor service.  (Which is pretty remarkable.)

The main reason we love it so much is the food.  Oh my gosh, they have the most delicious Mexican food.  My husband loves the Chili Rellenos they serve.   A Chili Relleno consists of a stuffed, roasted, fresh poblano pepper (a mild chili pepper named after the city of Puebla), and he always gets the rice and beans with it.  

I like a number of items they serve.  My favorite is the bacon-wrapped shrimp, but it is a bit on the expensive side, so I don't order it too often, however, it is soooooo very good.  

We both enjoy the complimentary chips and salsa because they are also fresh, crisp and come with 3 types of salsa.  

I can't say much for the paintings on the walls, except that they are very different.  Have yet to decide if I like or dislike them.  They are eye-catching as the artist painted with a unique perspective.  

Portions of food are large, which my husband loves.  He always ends up eating what I can't finish. 

The food is most likely fattening, but the great taste makes eating there a special occasion.  Like I said, it has become my favorite places to eat out in the Sun City/Peoria/Glendale area."}
{"text":"Traveling through with family and stopped in for salads. What a treat! They were fresh and tasty. We just wish we could bring the restaurant and staff home with us. Everything's homemade, including amazing desserts."}
{"text":"Abuelo's is pretty good. We went there for a birthday party and the service was fantastic. I would give the food a B - good - not fantastic - but good. Atmosphere and interior pleasing too. All in all a good choice for Mexican if you're in Peoria."}
{"text":"Excellent selections on the menu, reasonable prices , and Thursday night Prime Rib melts in your mouth. 
The noise level is somewhat disturbing."}
{"text":"\"Meh. I've experience better\" definitely captures it.  Nothing especially 'wrong' but nothing right either.  

The chips are paper thin.  The fajitas aren't really seasoned and come with tons of onions and not enough peppers.  Tiny plate of toppings.  On the bright side my friend and I recently split an order of these bland fajitas with extra chicken, which was plenty of food and just a few bucks more for the extra chicken.  

We've been here before, so on our way out we were kind of looking around for the yummy buttermints that are normally sitting out in a bowl.  Upon request, we were each given a handful from a huge box hidden behind the host stand.   Why weren't they out - the hostesses didn't want to share??  

The courtyard feel to the restaurant is nice but the food isn't worth it.  And the happy hour ends at six o' clock; lame."}
{"text":"My friend introduced me to Abuelo's last week and I was expecting just another run-of-the-mill Mexican restaurant. The decor told me that this was no ordinary place! It looked a little like the Cheesecake Factory. Before our meals, chips (very light & crispy) and 3 salsas were brought to the table. I love variety so this was right up my alley and all were delicious! My chicken burrito was equally as delicious. My friend got the fajitas and thoroughly enjoyed every bite. I would highly recommend this wonderful restaurant and will definitely return!"}
{"text":"My husband was looking for fish tacos. We were near Abuelos so we stopped for an early lunch. We were greeted and seated promptly. We were so happily surprised by the outstanding service from the waitstaff and the chef/manager. It turns out that there were no fish tacos on the menu. He described what he wanted to the waitress and she said there would be no problem,the chef could do it. He personally came out and checked on the request so he could get it right! And right it was, 3 delicious, huge tacos filled with lettuce, tomatoes, pico, and each one had a large portion of tilapia! The tacos were served with lime rice and steam veggies. This meal was more than worth the cost. My chicken quesedilla,lunch portion was also perfect. What a delightful way to experience a restaurant for the first time. Love it! We will be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoyed our meal (El Grande) We recommend the tres leches cake. Yum! The flavor of the food all had a simmilarity and I think it was cominos or cumin powder. Even the beans were seasoned with it....hmmm. Otherwise, a flavorful experience!"}
{"text":"First time going here in years and this restaurant did not disappoint. We were greeted and shown to our seats with no wait. The mushroom appetizer was delicious and all of our entrées were on point. Our server was around long enough to serve us and stayed on top of our drinks but also allowed us to enjoy our evening uninterupted. He was wonderful. The establishment itself was very nicely appointed and the fining room was beautiful. There is nothing i would change about my experience today. I'm looking forward to a return visit in the future."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised when I arrived at this restaurant.  I usually try to pick 4 star restaurants to eat at when I travel.  This was rated a 3.5 when I went.  I expected a run of the mill average restaurant, but Abuelo's is not that.  This is a a very open high ceiling restaurant with a cloud painted ceiling and a large statue in the center.  It almost reminded me of mini fancy las Vegas casino shopping area.  I was clean and well lit.

The food was great.  The chips and salsa were a step above a normal Mexican restaurant.  The were served with 3 salsa's.  One tasted a little sweet (I think it had kiwi in it).  It is my new favorite.

The enchiladas were good.  The chili relleno was Dynamite.   The portions were huge.

The service was great.  Jyna did a great job!  We were seated quickly, the food was served quick and the server kept our drinks topped off.  

Overall I would highly recommend stopping by this great Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"We have been to Abuelo's a few times now.  I wish I could like it better.  I have held off with a review just to see if there was a consistency to the performance and there is.  The ambiance is great, the service is attentive, but the food is just OK.  They have a Tex-Mex menu and that is a plus, but again, the food is just OK.  Last night I had steak fajitas.  The meat had a good flavor but was was dry and the peppers and onions were barely cooked and completly unseasoned.  Some of the onion was still raw.  No salt on any of it.  They have a really good spinach casserole side and I love the lettuce leaves with the fajitas.  I wanted them to get better, but they haven't.  After this many visits, and no real change to the food, I have to assume medicrity is the norm.  Last night was probably the last vsit."}
{"text":"Went there Friday night, the atmosphere was great.  The drinks were good but the food was extremely salty.  I had the Classic Chicken Fajitas, burro beans, and the fixings.  I thought the chicken was salty until I tasted the beans.  They were so salty that I could not eat but one fork full.  Won't go back there any time soon, don't need the extra salt."}
{"text":"Fairly decent food. By no means authentic Mexican food, but their margaritas are pretty great. Whole place is a little pricy though. Atmosphere is nice, servers are polite and knowledgeable, and there is plenty of room for parking."}
{"text":"Really nice place with great food.  Bar area for cold beers and chips is great. Always clean and a nice staff"}
{"text":"Very disappointing.  Overpriced mediocre food.  Refried beans served with fajitas were so hot that they not only burned my tongue but throat as well."}
{"text":"This one of our favorite restaurants on the west side of Phoenix.  My wife and I eat here at least once per week.  The service is always consistently good and the food is above average and definitely consistently good.  It is well managed and even though we have to wait periodically, this is because the restaurant is so good.  Everything is good; the daily soups, the variety of entrees including shrimp, steak, chicken and mexican food.  A great value!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place tonight with my girl and her best friend and son.  Margarita pitcher to start with and usual chips and salsa.  Wish the margarita was a little stronger but it was good.  I ordered the chicken enchiladas with green chile sauce.  It was yummy but not outstanding.

My girl and her friend ordered some big dishes and they liked it.  her best friend said the Tamale was yucky tho.

Her son ordered the quesadilla with fries and he did not touch the quesadilla.  his mom tried it and knew why, it was nasty so we told the server and she refunded it.

Overall very nice, but I wanna try my mex appetite somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"Excellent service! Our waitress took a little bit to come to the table and the manager, Natalie, came personally to apologize, we had no need to complain, and she made everything right quickly. Would highly recommend and the food is excellent!"}
{"text":"Went with a party of five and had extremely slow kitchen service.  Apparently they were recovering from a very busy rush, but it still took us well over 45 minutes to get our food after ordering.   By the time the food arrived we'd gone through six buckets of chips and salsa.   The server did bring us some guacamole for our trouble and she was very pleasant, but that didn't make up for the slow kitchen.   We finally got our food and one of our guests had fish tacos and the flour tortillas were literally stuck to the plate and couldn't even be scraped off with a fork or knife.   Apparently they'd been sitting in the window for 20 minutes attaching themselves to the plate under heat lamps.   

The server was very apologetic and brought us some fresh fish tacos and even took off 30% of our bill for all the time we had to wait, but I can't give four stars to a Mexican joint that can't pop off a dinner for a table in over 30 minutes.  It's Mexican food.  Just scoop the meat into the shell and ladle on some sauce and send it out!"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible food. Service mediocre. Have eaten here for years and the food has gone down hill 100%. Manager walked away in the middle of a conversation.
No"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I love to come here when I visit from California. This is my third time here and I really enjoy the atmosphere. The food is decent and the service is great if you are a fan of Americanized on the cheap side Mexican food then this is the place for you. It's our tradition to come here and I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"We came for dinner on Friday night and it was really busy. We were told it would be a 45-minute wait for a party of 4, so we sat in the waiting area. The restaurant has some creative artwork and we were impressed with how clean everything looked. Luckily, about 20 minutes later, a table opened up and we were promptly seated. The food was great, but service was a little slow. Our server checked on us enough times to satisfy our needs, though. We would definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"Food and drinks were delicious! We waited for a bit to get our drinks but once our waiter, John, came to the table, he was FANTASTIC!!  John was Super friendly and knowledgeable on the menu. The dip sampler is definitely worth it! The meals are big and filling. I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"My family loves it when we go to Abuelo's.   No matter how many times we have gone, which is mini mini times, we always have a great meal and a great experience. I am particularly fond of the sangria margarita swirl. I would also recommend happy hour in the bar as this is a bargain ."}
{"text":"This place is VERY crowded and seems to be popular as the waits are always long and dining is typically loud. Abuelo's has many meals to choose from. The staff is friendly and was able to get drinks, appetizers, and meals out to my 8 person dinner quickly and efficiently."}
{"text":"I just can't believe this restaurant is rated so poorly!  It is my FAVORITE and I consider myself picky.  I think they have great cocktails and chips and salsa.  I always order the same thing... chili relleno, 2 avocado enchiladas with cream sauce and papas.  Yum!  I could eat here once a week."}
{"text":"Decent food for high prices! The location is beautiful. Very sophisticated and much Spanish vibes. Boyfriend and I shared the Fajitas for two and even took home leftovers. Try the mango lemonade!"}
{"text":"Abuelos ambience is good. The nacho chips are thin and crispy. Three types of salsa are given complimentary and they were good. The queso dip was creamy. The margarita pitcher for $22 was standard as usual loaded with ice. The service is efficient. The seating was immediate on a Saturday evening. The prices are reasonable for the quality of food. The tacos are okay. The Monterey enchilada portion size is huge better eaten if shared with someone and its price is $17.99. Kids menu is available. They are a Mexican chain restaurant on the lines of pf Chang , bahama breeze. There is nothing in the menu that stands out and it appears that I have been to this restaurant 3 times over the last 8 years and nothing has changed much."}
{"text":"Meh....  It looks like a chain. Has service like a chain. It's a chain. 

I have missed Mexican food, since we moved away from Arizona. I knew better than to make my long awaited return, to go explore a chain restaurant, but my parents recommended Abuelo's. 

Nothing was bad, but everything was average. Guacamole had flavor, but texture was like it came straight out of a gallon tin can. I had the chile relleno plate.  Enjoyed the shredded beef relleno, but did not finish my plate. 

I will seek out family run Mexican food joints.  I think Abuelo's will primarily be popular because of 3 words: location, location, location."}
{"text":"No Bueno Abuelos 

My husband and I rarely have date nights...and just had dinner at Abuelos. While the food and drinks were delicious, the service was horrible. We sat in the bar for dinner and Spike was our server. It was like pulling teeth to get a drink menu and he was so inattentive and unfriendly, it was completely uncomfortable. We couldn't wait to leave and even mentioned that to each other when our food was brought out. 
I'm glad we had a gift card and didn't spend any of our money, the experience was less than a pleasure."}
{"text":"What a letdown! I always like samples from Abuelo's at Taste of Madison. The restaurant experience was quite disappointing.

Hostess(es): Two women were seating people when we arrived. I watched them as we waited for our table. I never once saw a smile -- in fact, their facial expressions were complete scowls. 

Server: Our server was friendly. He may have simply been a bad server or overwhelmed, but the actual \"service\" was not there. We left the restaurant quite thirsty since we finished our drinks about halfway through our meal, and our server never refilled them. 

iPad thingy: ***Abuelo's, get the technology off the table!*** I don't want to use a touchscreen device at my table to place my appetizer order and/or \"call server.\" (A button on the screen actually says \"call server.\") If I'm spending a good hour of my night at a sit-down restaurant, I expect prompt and professional service from a competent human being during my dinner -- not a button. (Does this tech rant make me sound old and out of touch? I'm not even 30.)

Atmosphere: Stucco arches mixed with Victorian-style curtains. Top 40 music on the speaker. What is this theme?

If you're in Madison and want Mexican/Tex-Mex, go to Eldorado Grill."}
{"text":"I have been here several times, food is ok, some dishes are better than others. I had the steak and shrimp fajitas, sadly its more onions and hardly any peppers, but the steak was good but the BBQ sauce on the shrimp did not pair well( really bbq sauce on shrimp in a fajita dish????). Service was lacking, we had to stop our server to get our apps ordered and then again to order our entrees. I ran out of water and beer, and I wasn't the only one in our party waiting on drinks. The biggest complaint would be we could not order a shredded beef burro deep fried. Yep, you heard correctly a mexican food place that cant/wont deep fry a burro. Chicken, yes, but not the beef. no explanation from the server, just, \"we don't do that\". We went as a birthday dinner and sadly the bday boy could not get what he wanted.  Lousy experience."}
{"text":"Really like this place. Good food, decent prices. At lunch time I always ask to be seated in Nina's section. She has to be one of the nicest waitresses ever!"}
{"text":"Chips and 7layer dip, delicious! Everything else, not so much. I've been here over a dozen times and every time I wonder why I came. Save this place for chips and a margarita, never come here if you're actually hungry. Service has always been friendly though."}
{"text":"Chile rejenos ... I was very impressed w this restaurant. The decor was impressive and it is obvious that the menu items had been well thought out and professionally prepared. This is not your street corner Mexican restaurant... The food is top-notch!!!"}
{"text":"Abuelo's never disappoints!  Always delicious food and good service!!  Manny did a great job!!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times now. Before I was celiac and after. Prior it was good.  But if you are coming for gluten free food , go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I recently went to Abuelos because it was in the middle of where I live and where the people we were meeting live. I was not particularly impressed. The food was bland and was not very good. The salad was awful - it was basically lettuce smothered in cheese and beans and had a weird taste to it. The tortilla chowder also had a strange taste and I could only eat a few bites. The others at my table said their food was just ok - they ordered burritos and fajitas.

The only redeeming thing about going there was the delicious margaritas! I got the Island - with coconut - it was delightful. Otherwise, I would pass."}
{"text":"Coming from California my husband and I are very particular about Mexican restaurants. Our first time here and I have to say what a great experience we both had, atmosphere was amazing, and such great service. Our server Anthony was amazing, on point, and gave us great recommendations food wise and of course with the drinks. Definitely will be coming back and recommending to everyone in the valley!!!"}
{"text":"From the outside, Abuelo's looks well kept and inviting. When you step through the doors, you find the same thing. That alone goes a long way with me. I don't like walking into a place to eat and find that it's poorly kept or dirty.
Once seated, you are served freshly made chips and three salsas. I can't tell you much about them other than they were freshly made.
For my meal I decided on the Pescado Guerrero, which is Fire-grilled Barramundi topped with shrimp, sea scallops, mushrooms, spinach and roasted peppers, in a white wine sauce. It only took one bite and I realized that I was eating the best Mexican dish I've ever had. Everything was cooked perfectly, seasoned perfectly, and plated perfectly. The portion was more than enough, and I still finished everything.
If all of that weren't enough, they then brought the dessert tray. I can't speak for the rest of the choices, but I strongly recommend the Dulce de Leche Cheesecake. To borrow a line from a novel, it was \"almost too rich to finish, but too rich to leave.\" Translated that means it was some of the best I've eaten. 
All told, I would put my experience at Abuelo's very high in the running for best dining experience to date for me. Just in general I can't think of a better prepared meal I've ever had!
Well done, Abuelo's!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Affordable prices. By far the best mexican food place I have been to in Arizona. Happy hour is awesome
!"}
{"text":"I had the chance to have Abuelo's for lunch today. 

Food, well I ordered the Al Horno Quesadilla, it had chicken, cheese, guacamole, lettuce, tomatoes. The quesadilla was boring, it had little taste and reminded me of something in the Stouffers box in my freezer. 

Service, well we ordered our beverages first, just a coke and ice tea. Nothing special. Our server brought them back within minutes, we ask for just a few minutes to look over the menu some more. About 8 minutes later our server came over and took our order. Seemed a bit long.... Anyways he never did ask if we needed more chips and salsa or drink refills as we waited for our food. Our food finally came out delivered by another server. She asked if we needed anything, I asked her for a refill of our beverages and salsa and chips. Our original server brought back the items requested. Didn't say a word. We continued on with our meals and ate, we were done and no check up from our server, he appeared very busy by the bar (sarcasm). Finally a manager came by an asked how everything was. I advised him of the not so great service, He promptly took our plates and advised he would grab our check. He brought the check back and disappeared. As we were about to leave our original server comes running over and says I hope you guys enjoyed our meal and you come back soon. WTF no apology for your lack of service, a simple sorry about the wait would have fit the bill. I left feeling like they didn't want our business. Sorry but I will stick to the local Mexican restaurants. 

I just want to comment on the interior, it's beautiful with marble floors. Lets improve service and food and we would have ourselves a gem here Middleton."}
{"text":"The Monterey is hands down my favorite!!
Features 5 different types of enchiladas, a crispy chicken taco, guacamole, and the best side dish ever - papas con chile!! 
We've been here several times over the past few years and I've never had a bad experience or bad food.
We love sitting at the bar, catching a game, and having a great local beer on tap.
Service has always been superb, and the chips and salsa (3 salsa's tone exact), are always flowing! The staff doesn't miss a beat."}
{"text":"Very good salsa's which is delivered as a trio of a green, red and a smoked. 

With PF Changs next door and a long wait I chose this for dinner. They have a nice selection for any Tex and Mex taste you might have. 

The wait staff is pleasant and friendly which goes a long way."}
{"text":"I had come to this place a while back and so I referred the place to My family who had come out of town. I called in to make reservations and the girl on the phone said they didn't make reservations anymore, and than we show up to the restaurant and they tell us there was an hour and a half wait so we waited, and than after an hour and half, they tell Me it would be another hour and half, and I ask for the reason and the 4 girls that were standing in the fron just started being rude. So we left and end up going somewhere else. I would of biven this place a -5 if I could too."}
{"text":"Dinner with friends was tasty and made for an enjoyable evening. We all ordered off the \"over 60\" menu (are we really that old?) and it was a good deal & good food. Margaritas were excellent. Ate here a couple of months ago with a larger group and enjoyed that evening. All staff have always been friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Yup, went back on 9/15/14, we should have gone to bahamma breeze. The food is okay, but chips are still lame, and the time it took to get the food was too long for our group."}
{"text":"Great food great service great drinks! Authentic Mexican food always hot and served with a smile! Sometimes there is a wait but well worth it!!! Homemade fresh tortillas and yummy fajitas... Enchiladas to write home about! And get the cheese queso!!! :). don't try and use the Yelp 5 savings here ... they won't honor it! We were disappointed with that..."}
{"text":"the atmosphere was fantastic and the staff was stellar.  i truly enjoyed the enire experience.  the food was hot and i mean HOT lol.  everything we chose to have for dinner was amazing. i will definitely dine here again."}
{"text":"I don't understand all the negative reviews at all.  I've been to Abuelo's twice now and each time was good.  Most recently, we had a server that was outstanding, both in helping me decide on a dish and overall competence!

Their carnitas are delicious.  Also, THIS PLACE IS LISTED AS TEX MEX. If you don't like Tex Mex, then you shouldn't dine here and then give a bad review.

It was a nice dining experience, good food, nice atmosphere.  Thanks Abuelo's!"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time last night.   The restaurant inside/outside is beautiful.  It is very big/spacious, great decorating.  The chips I think are great, they are the very thin ones that you can just eat and eat until you realize you ate the whole basket (oops!)  I got the chicken fajita chimichanga drizzled with rancharo sauce, rice and re fried beans.  The portion was HUGE!!! The taste was great! I loved all of it.  My boyfriend got the fajita combo, chicken and shrimp next time we go there I am def getthing that.  whatever they marinated the chicken and shrimp in was to die for, I could have ate the chicken and shrimp all by itself.  Our waitress was great, extremely friendly!"}
{"text":"I had a great visit as a first timer. I was impressed with the the decor and the service. My family and I were helped quickly even though it was busy on a weekend. Not only that, the food was delicious which is why I would be a returning customer. The menu has different options and I must say that the list goes on. I got the chicken tacos, rice and beans. I stuck with the two chicken tacos because I didn't have a big appetite but one taco made me full. The next time I come, I will bring my appetite and gift card from Costco. Lol."}
{"text":"The Monetary is amazing we love the spinach enchilada"}
{"text":"Excellent Mexican restaurant!  My parents live in AZ, and took my sister and I here over the holidays for the happy hour.  The specials are awesome.  Each couple can order (lunch, I assume) entrees and an appetizer for $18 or something.  The sangria swirl was perfect--and not too pricey!  Cannot wait to get back to AZ just to go to this place.  : )"}
{"text":"I love the food here, we go every other week.  I live in Lake County and drive all the way to warrensville heights to eat.  love their enchiladas trio with rice and beans, desserts are fantastic, love the reloadable chips and trio of sauces that come free with the meals.  when my family came for reunion two years ago, they accommodated 35 people at one time easily :)"}
{"text":"We arrived on Sunday evening for a family dinner. 

Six of us in the party and we were seated right away. 

Restaurant is beautiful and clean. Our sever was Jaime and he was amazing and entertaining. An asset to your business. 

Everyone at our table ordered something different and not a negative thing was said about any of it. 

The food was damn good and I was surprised because I am so picky when it comes to Mexican food. It wasn't greasy or piled high with enchilada sauce and extra cheese to drown out the flavor or lack there of it. 

Only down fall I can say is for our family of 4. Husband, wife and two teenage daughters it was $85.00. Pretty pricey for a family night dinner but think this will be the hubby and I's little spot. 

No alcohol was ordered or anything extras or appetizers."}
{"text":"We had a reservation for 10 and were seated promptly. Our waiter was attentive and got us out our drinks quickly. They have a small computer screen at the table from which you could order drinks which was kind of cool. The food was pretty average however with no one too impressed with their dish. The chips they brought out with 3 different salsas were excellent! Best part of the experience. They did goof up one order that didn't get done. Just so happened to be the birthday boys. Manager was good about it and brought out a complimentary shot of tequila. My biggest gripe was very limited beer selection. I know it's a Mexican restaurant, but their beer on the whole is boring. Get a few local taps installed and correct this please. I did no drink one, but apparently the margaritas were pretty good and not a bad deal by the pitcher."}
{"text":"I am not going to comment on authenticity.  Been to this place a few times. Each time friendly service and good food at a fair price.  One of the better chain Mexican food places"}
{"text":"Bland food.  Staff was nice.  Atmosphere was great.  Won't again though because the food wasn't good."}
{"text":"On 5/19/2013.......Went there for an early dinner, around 2:00 PM The hostess was as pleasant as a wet towel, not a smile or a hello. Just asked...How many?...and sat us down. When we left there were two of the hostesses at the entrance, neither of them said a word as we walked out the door!. Service was a little spotty, and the waiter could have been more attentive, and simply put the check on the table without asking if we wanted desert, which we did! The food was better then average, good flavors! But could have come to the table a little hoter then what it was. Management really needs to do some in house training on the staff!"}
{"text":"I have recently fallen in love with their spinach enchiladas with queso sauce. Seriously, the best spinach enchilada I have ever had. Because of this, I have determined I like Abuelos even more and upped their score to 5 stars. Also, I have never had bad service here and the atmosphere is beautiful."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the food ,service and margaritas. Got there at 4:45 on a Friday night and by 5:30 there was a long waiting line- so go early. Really enjoyed the trio appetizer with the chips. When going to a Coyotes Hockey stop here first!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for 8 years. Food never lets me down. Also have some of the best Margaritas in the Arizona."}
{"text":"I gave it 5 stars  because of our waitress  Megan. She was excellent. Chips and salsa  very good,margarita  good. Food came out quickly, all was good.  Left full,need one closer to the 10 and Estella  parkway.  All was good."}
{"text":"Great happy hour spot. The food is reasonably priced and delicious. Not your typical Sonoran Mexican food so come ready to enjoy some authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"So disappointing. The pros: good service and nice atmosphere. The cons: food quality, quantity, price. Lunch 'specials' are 9.99-12.99 for the most part.  Fajitas came on 3 small saucers. One with a bit of lettuce and cold shredded cheese. One with refried beans. The third with a child's size portion of meat and peppers. Crazy small and I'm not even a large eater. With 1 glass of house wine each, our lunch bill for 2 was $45!!!  Cannot recommend."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Excellent service and the food arrives piping hot. Wish the queso was a bit spicier"}
{"text":"My model wife and I came here looking for some Tex-mex in Phoenix. We had had some excellent Tex mex in San Antonio last week and wanted to see what we could find at home. I searched a bunch of places and settled on abuleos. 

Trio queso dip: excellent. Not as great as the queso we had in San Antonio but come on this is Phoenix not San Antonio. Great for here. 

Free chips and trio salsa: wonderful. The chips were thin and crispy. Very fresh. The salsas ranged from mild to hot and one was pineapple sweet. 

Peasado veracruze: very nice. A light and favorable fish with a wonderful olive caper tomato sauce. Perfectly cooked fish. 

Enchiladas: I had 2. One chicken with green sauce. Good not great. One shredded beef with sour cream sauce. Amazing. Really deep beef flavor. Next time I am just going with shredded beef. :)

Service was 5/5. Food 5/5. This is a great place for casual Mexican Food and I really liked their Tex mex offerings."}
{"text":"Excellent food, Chip,-Salsas! Great ambiance especially in the bar area. Great service and electronic tabletop checkout is great!"}
{"text":"Dinner for five. Walked in about 5PM noticed a half dozen people sitting in the waiting area so was prepared for a wait. Daughter in law goes to give our name - 5 minutes later we were seated at a table.  If that wasn't good enough before we were all seated our waitress was at the table with chips and salsa and handing out menus and taking drink orders. Server was excellent and when she saw my wife trying to get a group photo immediately took her camera and took photos for the entire group. Everything we ordered tasted great. Very prompt on bringing out appetizers, main course, drinks and dessert.  Ambience is excellent. Will definitely recommend and look forward to another visit. Bill for entire group about $130 + tip"}
{"text":"So this place has hand painted walls to ceilings (they kinda remind me of Caesar's Palace in Vegas). The chips and salsa are awesome, ambiance is great, service and the food is very good. Not what I consider authentic Mexican but it's very good food indeed. Must try dish: Pollo con Calabazas (marinated grilled chicken with zucchini and cream sauce with rice and your choice of refried or charro beans...go with charro)"}
{"text":"This restaurant serves really good mexican food at reasonable prices. The location and decor are great and make it look like a really expensive restaurant without the high prices. The service is almost always top-notch and prompt. My pick from the extensive menu would be the enchiladas."}
{"text":"Waitress and atmosphere are good. I got chicken fajita, and it was cold...usually my fajitas sizzle on my plate, it was barely warm to touch. And was very bland and flavorless. Wouldn't come back or recommend it to anyone :/"}
{"text":"Abuelos has been there for a long time but for some reason I have never been there. So I decided to try it. Walking in, I was very impressed with the decor - looked like the Cheesecake Factory - or maybe a casino. Sat at the bar and started with a margarita. It was ok. Tasted a little watered down. I had 2 of them - which usually does the trick for me - these must have been really light on tequila because I did not feel the alcohol. They brought chips and 3 salsas. The salsas tasted out of the can - and chips were out of a bag- not much taste. I had a combo with enchilada, tamale, taco, rice and beams. The taco beef tasted like Taco Bell but it did have nice lettuce and tomato - the shell was crisp. Tamale tasted like out of a can although it was sitting on a husk. Avocado enchilada was smothered in a white cheese- the advocado was out of a can - smooth texture with no flavor. The rice and beans were tasty.  I kept waiting for something to kick in after I finished my 2nd drink - it felt like I had 3/4 of a real drink since they were so watered down. My bill was $31. - after tip I walked out spending $36 for a below average meal. Abuelos probably stays in business from sun lakes residents and people in from out of town that think this is the authentic southwest Mexican food.  Go down to Rositas on Dobson/Guadalupe - not much on decor - but the food, chips/salsa, and drinks blow this place away.  Mexican food should have some flavor - Abuelo's is overall very bland."}
{"text":"I love Abuelo's. It is one of my favorite places to go to in the Cleveland area. Everyone who works here is always very pleasant. Every server I've ever had has been wonderful. I would like to especially acknowledge Robert who, even if I haven't been here in weeks-months, still has my order memorized! I highly recommend Abuelo's!"}
{"text":"The staffs really nice. The inside is very clean and so pretty. The food is ok, but the  chips and salsa are great!"}
{"text":"A 5 normally, but yesterday a 3 due to the following: We have eaten here a few times sitting in each area...choosing the bar this time yesterday because the booth seats they first took us to were way too previously sat-in. The service was quite slow. 40 min. to get food & I received stuffed mushrooms mid-warm & sent them back, salad was delivered w/o dressing...that finally came...w/o asking. No return drink order inquiry...  We made comment to the bar tender-server about our experience as multi-return customers. He wasn't happily responsive immediately, however, he did do the right thing. A manager came to share that the kitchen was experiencing back-up (somebody called in sick at the last minute?), but were catching up (another 1 or 2 kitchen personnel came?)... He shared that he'd take the mushrooms off the bill as well as... \"I'll take care of you\"...  Upon normal check delivery the original bar tender-server announced that our bill has been taken care of completely by his manager. We will return! They knew how to rectify a poor situation."}
{"text":"The food and service at Abuelo's in Chandler is ALWAYS fantastic.  My family , business associates and friends dine there frequently.  Stopped by last Friday for lunch for my wife's birthday.  Lizette was our server .
She was GREAT!! Service at Abuelo's is the best in the East Valley and Lizette went the extra mile to make us feel like family. She topped off  our main course with a yummy dessert. We've dined there many, many times at lunch and dinner.  I believe Abuelo's menu has the most choices of true Mexican dishes in Arizona.  I highly recommend Abuelo's by Chandler Fashion Mall on Chandler Blvd.  You won't be disappointed !!"}
{"text":"Walking into this cavernous place at 4:30 p.m. on a Saturday was like walking into an AARP convention!  This was not our choice of restaurants as we met some (older) friends here.  Came with VERY low expectations. Many patrons were apparently came by for a bite after a day out looking at assisted-living places.  

The crowd did get younger as it got later - and in fact it was mobbed after 6 p.m.  Happy hour daily.  We had a kid waiter who hustled and did a great job for us.  Decent salsas.  The food, though inauthentic, actually was not bad.  I had a barramundi filet covered in a creamy mild red sauce with some rice and steamed veggies for about $20.  Kind of reminded me of a dish I might be served at some large group function in a hotel ballroom.

Frankly I don't understand why this place is so popular - but I must admit it was better than I expected...  While I am not a fan of Macayos - I actually think this place is one step up from them...  A good family option for mexican food for those that don't know what buche, sesos, or tripa are..."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to go to Abuelos for lunch last week since were in that part of town.  The hostess was very nice and seated us immediately.  All seemed well until our server came to out table.  You could just tell he didn't want to be there.  He asked us what we wanted to drink, then tossed out napkins to us.  My napkin slid to the other end of the table.  Then he just walked away.  My husband and I just looked at each other wondering if maybe we were reading something more than it really was into it.  But then he came back and asked if we were ready to order.  We told him we needed a minute and he just turned his back and walked away without saying anything.  I was ready to go.  
My husband suggested we sit at the bar because the bartender was really cool.  We walked over to the hostess and she could tell something was wrong and asked if there was something wrong.  When we told her she seemed genuinely concerned; she apologized and told us she would get the manager.  We sat at one of the table by the bar and the bartender came over immediately and greeted us.  He is a spirited guy!  We felt right at home.  We ordered drinks and our entrees.  
The manager came over to out table to talk to us.  He also apologized for our experience and thanked us for staying.  He gave us the Abuelos dip sampler.  I had never had that before.  It was delicious.  The chili and cheese was my favorite and my husband's was the avocado cream.  I had the steak fajitas and my husband had the fajitas tacos.  They were both really good.
So although we got terrible service from our initial server who shouldn't be a server if he doesn't like being around people, the rest of our experience made up for it.  I always appreciate when the management team shows that they are willing to earn our business back!"}
{"text":"I had the steak and chicken fajitas and they were AMAZING! Huge portion with excellent flavor.  My 3 friends loved their dishes as well."}
{"text":"This was my first time dining at Abuelo's and I found the service, food, and swirls to be fantastic. The restaurant was moderately busy at noon for lunch. Everyone in the area should be here for lunch!  They have great lunch specials and from what I have heard an amazing Thurs night prime rib dinner. If you haven't been to Abuelo's you should dine there."}
{"text":"I love Tex-Mex. Can't beat the steak and enchiladas combo. Ask the waiter about which enchiladas are best. Get a coke to wash it down."}
{"text":"Wow I'm full of amazing food! Did I mention the service? Becca was great and my food with two types of beans and that cheesy sauce on zucchini was delish! Now I just need someone to roll me out of this place"}
{"text":"Okay so it's a huge restaurant. They have some really good food. I can't remember what I have gotten every time but I just know that I've gotten something different. However my first time was with my ex boyfriend back a year ago. I've had the stuffed spinach mushrooms recently. I think I had fish tacos at one point? The last time I was here I was there with my best friends family and our waiter was so nice. Always made sure we had everything we needed and water and stuff. It's a little fancier on the inside and outside. So you can dress up if you like but most people today just don't care lol. I had a mimosa one time from here and it was good. I also had beer. I think I got a Dos Equis. Which is always my favorite but I think it was a different brew than I was used to so I didn't drink as much as I wanted. I love coming here though! They always bring 3 salsas out and some chips."}
{"text":"Had lunch today...food was just ok, the hostess was crying at the hostess stand, serves was very slow...ordered chicken fajitas the presentation was awful no plate was supplied, guacamole was 99c extra...very poor over all.
Not somewhere i would recommend."}
{"text":"Beautiful on the inside.   Food is mediocre and not authentic.  Service was good to start but after that we received our food , our waiter disappeared and we were forced to wait for refills.  We essentially received one refill in  what was a little over an hour."}
{"text":"Just opened this month, the place is set up really well.  The inner part actually has lighting that makes it look like you are sitting in an outdoor plaza.  Right now, I think because they just opened they are incredibly overstaffed, but that isn't a bad thing.  The food was excellent and different from the normal mexican cuisine.  My friend had an avacado enchilada that was amazing...and very different!  My fajita chicken salad with guacamole and zesty lime dressing was perfect, and the latest boytoy had something with an egg on it that he finished completely.  My friend is vegetarian, and there were tons of options.  For dessert we had a dulce de leche cheesecake that was perfect!  The staff was friendly and willing to please, I'll definitely go back! 5 Stars."}
{"text":"The happy hour (which I think runs from 3-7 in the bar) is pretty good and you'll get $s off margaritas and deals on an assortment of appetizer options. The El Jefe margarita is delicious and the verde salsa that comes with the chips is a nice change up.  The restaurant is pretty big so it would be a great place for large groups. There is also plenty of parking and it's easy to find. I ordered the avocado and spinach enchiladas and they were tasty."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a handful of times since moving to the valley in 2003 so was surprised that I hadn't yet reviewed this restaurant.  I hadn't been back until just recently since my last visit three years ago wasn't all that great. My mistake though--I thought the chicken tacos would be a bit more special than something you'd find on a cafeteria lunch tray. Seriously--I'm not joking folks. 

So last Friday my friend and I went to Abuelos for dinner. We were pleasantly surprised we could get seated within 10 minutes of arriving. Although the seating arrangements left a LOT to be desired (we were seated in the middle of the restaurant, at a table, with this horrible daylight lighting) we were too hungry to care. 

After going through a couple baskets of chips and bowls of fresh, delicious salsa, we were ready to order. My friend ordered the three soft chicken tacos and a bowl of their Mexican Chicken Soup. She said the soup was not tasty at all and would not order it again. Her entree however, got rave reviews...although she took more than half of it home. 

I chose the two chicken enchilada entree with rice and beans. One chicken enchilada was covered in the sour cream sauce, the other in the rachera sauce. Both were DELICIOUS. So much so, that I considered getting another order to go! (which by the way is SO not like me but at 9 months pregnant, I'd say ANYTHING goes!) 

Overall we left satisfied and both commented on how, overall, we both enjoyed our meals. We will definitely be back again soon...and I know just what I will be ordering!"}
{"text":"holy crap.  i realized i didn't make a review here, only on Facebook.  let me tell you this place is GROSS. i can't even remember what i ordered because once my ceviche came to the table i realized they didn't know what they were doing in the kitchen and started to cry.  

i can tell you this, my abuelo would be sad if he tasted this meal that was called \"food\".  

DO NOT GO.  EVER."}
{"text":"This is a go-to place for me and my family when I'm in town. The primary reason? Well, the really good quality food, of course. But more than that, this is a place that has quality food for all types of people. My mother is someone who very rarely eats Mexican food because the spice (and really ANY spice at all) is too much for her. I, on the other hand, like things fairly spicy. Others prefer to be sweating heavily into their dishes...so understandably, the wide variety of preference can be hard to cater to. This place has it all, and did I say quality? Quality food here. Just quality...

...And quantity! Pretty big dishes. Others have complained about the severs but I've never had a problem. Drinks stay full, people are nice and are not hovering over your table constantly. Ive never been spoken to rudely or any of that nonsense, just kind of typical average dinner-going experiences all around.

The decor and atmosphere are quite nice. You really get the feeling you're in some fancy casita owned by some drug lord somewhere in Mexico. Was that racist? Whatever. Its inviting, its a little flashy, it gives your eyes somewhere to wander if your date is boring as sin.

They have their own unique spin on things for a restaurant of this type: ie offering potatoes as an option to rice & beans, monstrous combo plates, etc. I like that because it makes it an experience you're really not going to find elsewhere too easily. Keeps me coming back.

Overall, I highly recommend this place. Yeah its gringo mex fare, but its pretty delicious anyway. Great place to have a beer or five with your meal, and I think you'll be coming back often as well."}
{"text":"A great atmosphere with friendly and quick service. But for me the chicken fajitas were pretty boring."}
{"text":"Bravo! It's so hard to find a good Mexican restaurant in the valley that doesn't serve crap for food with a pile of unmelted cheddar cheese on top and a side of wilted lettuce. Nope not this place and thank goodness! This is like the Cheesecake Factory of Mexican restaurants. That means you will order from an expertly crafted menu along with receiving a consistently good experience.

I brought my husband here for his birthday. He's picky! I ordered a Cadillac margarita, which was strong and had the perfect flavor and balance. Our green chile quesadilla appetizer came with a delicious ranch sauce that contained marinated chiles. I ordered the two enchiladas with pork medallions. My enchiladas were shredded beef and carnitas. Home run. The mashed potatoes were fantastic as were the charro beans. The pork was beautifully cooked and smoky. The enchiladas reminded me of the flavors of New Mexico. No Filiberto crap here!

My husband had a three enchilada combo and he loved it! The only disappointment was the chocolate explosion cake. It was dry - another review mentioned that - and there was very little of the fudge sauce. The whipped cream was the kind out of a can and far too sweet, it should have been freshly whipped and unsweetened. I would recommend they rethink this dessert, as you don't want to end someone's meal on a low note.

Four stars from me, but would have been five if the desert worked."}
{"text":"I am absolutely impressed with this place. I came here several years ago and didn't love it, but after coming back tonight with my family I will be back again!  

Our server Jeremy was very professional and knowledgable. I am a vegetarian so eating Mexican can be pretty tricky, but Jeremy was super helpful and patient with me! He also laughed along at my dad's jokes and was very quick witted. Cool guy! 

The food was delicious. The fajitas were served piping hot and my parents said they were amazing. I was so full from the appetizer guacamole and jalepeño fritters that I could barely finish my food. 

The one and only downside was that there is no fried ice cream (sad face). That's not enough to deter us from coming back and hanging with Jeremy though!"}
{"text":"Another visit and tried some new dishes...always great food and attentive service. Our server, Larry was especially helpful today...thank you!  I had the Chili Relleno with shredded beef, a chicken enchilada and the rice and beans and all were perfect.The trio of dips sampler before hand was especially good today. Great place.

Topped everything off with a slice of key lime pie and texture, taste, temperature and presentation were perfect."}
{"text":"We love this place.  We go there so much we have earned two $50 reward gift cards so far with their rewards program.  We have gone here for years.  They even catered our wedding.  That's love!  I LOVE the chips and salsa.  The chips are super thin which most place don't have. I always get the shredded beef enchiladas with queso.  YUMM!  I also love the layered dip but get it with shredded beef (my secret).  The Pescado guerro is amazing as well.  It's all good but those are my favorites."}
{"text":"Wife and I have been going to Abuelos for years, so when we feel like Mexican food there was no other place we considered. We like it so much we drive out of our way to eat there. We frequent Abuelos where ever we find them including but not limited Phoenix, Chandler and Kansas City MO. 

So for my wife and I to give a 1 star should hopefully get the attention of the owners. We were extremely disappointed with the food and lack of service during our last few visits to the Chandler location. I would bet on it that the management were not there yesterday during our visit because there was a lack luster attention to service period. 

We arrived at 330pm, to find 3 seated tables and a bunch of staff some making eye contact with us as we stood there waiting to be seated. As we stood in the lobby waiting to be seated for 10mins, I turned around to walk out before my wife waved down a waiter who noticed us when we first walked in to seat us. The host was no where to be found but did show as the waiter grabbed the menus. Out of the corner of my eye the host gave our waiter a dirty look, yes I did see that rudeness coming from the host with long black hair. I'm kinda glad someone decided to do her job. But after the food and service, I should have went with my gut feeling and walked out. After all, going to eat at the odd hour has its chance of being served leftover dried out food, but I felt Abuelos was a different place to eat, NOT SO.  


The Pasta La Paz my favorite was lacking sauce, the chicken was dried up leftovers from lunch and had been placed under the salamander to heat then left on the counter to cool to less than room temp when served. My wife's fajitas tacos where not fajita stips but chopped up leftover beef from the lunch. 

We pushed out empty drink glasses to the edge of the table for refills which finally got filled after 15mins. We could not wait to get out of there, we are so disappointed since we loved this place so much. 

We started noticing this on the last few visits, when we have ate there during off hours. Sadly,  I won't spend another $40 to find out if they have change, that was our purpose for our recent visit. We enjoyed our multiple monthly visits to Abuelos, but that will not be the case any longer. 

Hope this helps improve on what once was a great experiences for us."}
{"text":"I really love this place. Upon walking in we were promptly greeted and since we made a reservation we were seated almost right away. The place has a Mexican flair in decor and a nice cozy feel. Our service was quick and our server was super attentive. I ordered the bacon wrapped shrimp and I couldn't finish it! Food was hot and fresh. I am not a fan of those computers on the table and was grateful when the server suggested removing it. I will defiantly return since the food is always delish and superb service."}
{"text":"Abuelo's is a chain of Mexican restaurants that would've rivaled Chi-Chi's back in the day though the menu items are fresher and the decor is more light and refreshing. Delicious entrees and a wide variety of combination platters. I get the Laredo which is a beef enchilada, cheese enchilada and crispy beef taco. served with rice and beans. Better yet, try the Grande: Three enchiladas: one beef, one cheese and one sour cream chicken, a cheese chile relleno, tamale, crispy beef taco and guacamole. I also have to mention Papas Con Chili. A blend of whipped potatoes, red and green peppers, four cheeses and sour cream. You absolutely have to try them! Wash it down with a drink from the bar-  with a huge variety of beers and unique mixed drinks and margaritas. The Agave margarita and the Sangria Swirl are really unique. Service is usually very good and the there's hardly ever a wait. They also have daily lunch specials so check them out as well. You will love this place."}
{"text":"I have been here twice, once a few months ago, and then again yesterday. The gap between visits reflects the fact that I don't go out for lunch often- not the quality of the experience.
Anyhow- the prices aren't bad. Lunch entrees are around $10, and a good amount of food. Now- I am a bad judge of Mexican food, because I always like it. I even like it when others don't. Anything fried, with carbs and cheese, and I am happy. So yes I enjoyed my meal (I had the Nachos Grande). :)  
My favorite metric for service at a restaurant is how many refills I get. I LOVE fountain diet cola. Every time my glass got to about 15%, the server showed up with another. At one point, I had 2 full ones because the manager brought one while our server was bringing another. (Yes, I know diet cola is ridiculous when eating bad for you food... but I like the taste. I don't let it in my house, because I drink too much of it, so when I go out, I indulge...) 
Second- the person I was meeting was late. I ate all the complimentary chips and salsa before he arrived. The server brought another. I ate that too. I was halfway through my third basket when my lunch companion arrived. The server brought yet another basket of chips. (I swear, I spend an hour a day at the gym- I take my lunch 19/20 days, but when I go out to eat, I go to town)
Anyhow, I love when restaurants are fast and generous with the refills. 
I would go back for sure."}
{"text":"I almost stroked-out from high sodium levels
No bueno por caca."}
{"text":"I haven't had an issue with cleanliness yet like the other comments I was reading but I have dealt with rude staff. Luckily as soon as my friends became waiters and waitress I got better service. But it's not cool that they are rude to customers.

The other thing that I am not liking is fajita's they changed their recipe for it. It has some type of squash I just want the bell peppers and onion classic fajita's.

The only reason I still keep it at the 4 star is because of the flan. It is amazing and I love it. That is the one reason I keep going back.

I just need to fine a menu item that I like and hopefully they will not change it again."}
{"text":"Conveniently located among a cluster of other midscale dining chains in Arrowhead Fountain Centre, Abuelo's offers an impressive variety of fare, but unfortunately fails to deliver in terms of flavor and quality..

I came in to preview their food, in preparation for my daughter's upcoming graduation. She wanted to find a nice place to go with her grandparents so I was sent on a recon mission. 

When I first walked in, I was struck by the beautiful interior design, every detail trying to replicate the experience of being in the courtyard of an old Spanish villa. Weathered columns. Trees. An odd statue in the middle. The ceiling was painted to simulate a pale blue afternoon sky, white clouds frozen in time. I have to admit - it was rather well-executed. But it did reminded me of the malls of Las Vegas (think the Forum at Caesars or the Venetian) with their simulated marble finishes and mock skies that hope you forget just how fake everything is.

Unfortunately, this lack of authenticity carries over to the food as well.

The first thing I noticed when I sat down was the Ziosk machine on the table. What?! I thought I was at a real restaurant. If you're not familiar with Ziosk machines, they are mini-touch screen computers used for ordering food so you don't have to talk to a waiter, playing games so you don't have to talk to your family, and paying your bill. Thanks Ziosk! These machines are sometimes seen at casual dining restaurants (ex. Chilis) and airports. Actually, those are the only places I've seen them. Thankfully, as soon as I sat down a real person came to greet me. 

The waiter was actually very friendly. He offered me chips with three kinds of salsa. The chips themselves were thin, unsalted corn chips that tasted like they just came out of a huge 5-gallon plastic bag - you know the ones. The salsas were... interesting:

Salsa one  - bland, red sauce. No reason to waste your time with this.
Salsa two - chunkier salsa with a roasted tomato flavor, nice kick and mellow burn.
Salsa three - tomatillo based salsa with a curiously sweet/tart flavor brought to you by pureed pineapple. Interesting, but not something I want on a tortilla chip.

The menu is HUGE. Very extensive. Like Cheesecake Factory extensive. For those of you who came to \"America's Favorite Mexican Restaurant\" but don't want to actually try Mexican food, don't worry  - they have you covered with dishes such as Hickory-smoked Ribeye, Lobster Seafood Pasta, and Prime Rib. 

I went for the Monterrey Plate - a ridiculously huge platter that is probably intended for two people to share. I say that because I could only get through about half of it before I was just plain tired of eating. The Monterrey features:

Chile Relleno - nicely-charred poblano pepper, stuffed with cheese buried under a pile of salsa - Not bad.
Rice - Ok. 
Cheesy Mashed Potato - Ok, but probably unnecessary.
Crispy Chicken Taco - The crunchy shell was a nice change of pace. It seemed like its only purpose was to provide contrasting texture against the platter of mushiness.
Two Chicken Enchiladas -  Quite flavorful. Probably my favorite part of the meal.
Avocado Enchilada - Sounds like a good idea. It is not.
Sour Cream Spinach - more mush
Yes, it is a TON of food. It looks nothing like the pictures because everything seemed to be smothered with sauce or cheese.

All in all, if you are looking for typical chain Mexican fare, then this is typical chain Mexican fare. Right along the same lines as El Torito or Macayos. Rather bland and uninspired. 

Needless to say, we didn't take the grandparents here..."}
{"text":"I really, really love this place.  Have eaten here several times in the past month. Last night,  our server was Andre and he was fabulous and fast.  Get gift cards at Costco for a discount and enjoy. Also,  sign up for their loyalty card!!"}
{"text":"It is as if Paula Deen and her band of merry sons commandeered the kitchen of this place.  I'm not saying it isn't pretty tasty.  How could it not be when all of the standard Mexican recipes have been adulterated with copious amounts of butter, cream, and over fatty additives.  I'd love to see what the calorie count is on these dishes because I'd wager that the vast majority are in 4 digit country."}
{"text":"Good basic Mexican food,  nothing really outstanding or really spicy.  Group of 5 so we had quite a variety of meals. All were good, stick with the Mexican rice and skip the  \"cheesy potatoes \" which seemed more like grits than Mexican food.  Service was slow, we were told the kitchen was slow because of a big group in the rest of the place. We ate chips and salsa almost until we were in danger of needing to skip the meal.  They did bring out lots and kept the drinks filled so it wasn't the wait staff delaying the food."}
{"text":"Had a disappointing meal last night for the first time after eating at the restaurant many, many times. I left feedback on a survey at the table and was contacted today by the GM, Michael Patrone. He was very professional and handled the situation very well. Nice to have a quick, professional response and to know that they care about their customers.  Definitely worth going back ;-)"}
{"text":"Chain Mexican food...that is actually good!?!?! No Way!! But yes! This is one Chain you can't turn your nose up at! 

Whether it is for lunch or dinner, I am never let down with their food or service! Their lunch menu is affordable and good serving sizes, so you don't feel like you are breaking the bank.

Dinner has so many choices, but I will only name the two I rotate between. I am a huge Chile Rellenos fan, I order them every where I go and I am particular about where to get the good ones. Abuelo's has excellent Chile Rellenos!

The next dish that is probably the best one on the menu and they know it, is their LOS MEJORES DE LA CASA, which is 2 small perfectly cooked bacon wrapped beef tenderloin medallions and 2 shrimp with bacon, cheese and jalapenos, mmmmm so so so Good!!! Good along with all its synonyms in the thesaurus!!!

If you haven't tried it yet, go! What are you waiting for!?!?!?"}
{"text":"this was my first time at Abuelo's and our service was very nice. I had three chicken taco and with bean and rice. the food was okay and any body make chicken taco and rice and bean and your Marguerite was to strong for me and I will not be coming back to Abuelo's anymore."}
{"text":"This is a very nice upscale place to sit down with friends and enjoy a real good Mexican food with great service. Our waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu and provided great service.

For starters I had the Mexican Shrimp Cocktail and then ordered enchilada dish that consisted of three enchiladas, two beef, and one chicken along with sides. Overall, a very good experience and would visit them again real soon  

Great menu and service."}
{"text":"What can I say about this place but fabulous. The food and atmosphere are out of this world, along with the service. Each time we have eaten here we take food home, as the portion size is plentiful."}
{"text":"\"I am a way picky Mex eater partially because I had the luxury of growing up with real authentic mex food thanks to my grandparent's. My mother in law has to go here every time she visits AZ which I always am ehhh about Abuelos nothing special about the food just the atmosphere really =-o The chips and salsa are very good thin crispy not greasy, perfect really.So this last time we went was THE last time I go there PERIOD. My MIL even said she remembered the food being better, while it was never a big deal for me.

It was my daughter's b-day. The service was awful! The server was Russian she couldnt understand much of anything. We had 2 toddlers with us and ordered 1 kid's plate for them to share well she brought 2 anyway and when we explained once again only 1 was ordered she was going to take plate #2 back and throw it in the bin, we then told her nevermind we'd keep the plate instead of wasting food for her mistake. We had the seared tuna starter pretty good and unexpected and something you dont see too often at mexican. I had the tortilla soup it was not good I have had 100x better from Red Robin, it didnt have any tortilla in it I asked what the deal was. She said it comes with a side of crunchy tort strips she had forgotten to bring out. I had the Green Chile con Chicken quesadilla - the chicken to be safe. I had a Mojito it was under their signature cocktails, it was the worst I have ever had anywhere\" I sent it back wanting more cool mint taste she took forever but there was no change in my drink I left it untouched. We were a party of 6 no one was too happy with their dinner the kid's loved their chicken nuggets but they are kid's and love mcd's. We got the bill and were still charged for the horrible mojito and 2nd kids plate that was not ordered but would have gone in the bin. They did however concauct some desert for my daughter which she loved and was free maybe because her bday!?!?! Who know's but I won't be going back!"}
{"text":"The first thing I saw when I walked in was a huge, vaguely creepy statue and I noticed that the whole place smelled like bacon and old person.  I chose to eat outside.  The waiter, who was very nice and attentive, asked if I would like the queso with my chips and, like an idiot I said yes.  I got charged $5 for what was basically a dish of sticky Velveeta.  The beans also tasted of bacon and the chicken in the enchilada was very salty.  The quacamole and the rice were quite good.  If you want mexican food, La Hacienda or El Dorado Grill are much better options."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Abuelo's for dinner on a Saturday night.  The wait was not too long.  Unfortunately, we were seated at a partially cleaned table and had a server that was quite oblivious to our presence.  We spoke with the manager, JR, and he was very professional and customer oriented.  He apologized for our experience and made it right.  I was very impressed with his reaction to the complaint & will definitely go back to Abuelo's knowing that their leadership cares about their guests' experiences."}
{"text":"I have been here quite a few times. Some days are really good and others are blah. I guess it's just your preference. The Durango burrito is really good though. I wish I had more to say. The drinks could be better. I feel they are a little weak."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Guacamole tasted ok but a menu partner was Cavalo. This company makes guacamole for a living. Is their guacamole really fresh?  

They sent a mixed message with music, a cross between classic rock and pop in a great Latin atmosphere.  While I know it was Monday night and probably no need for a band, they could have done better with the music selection.

At 7:00 PM parking lot lights between them and PF Changs were completely out - It's fall reset your timers or check your photocell."}
{"text":"Darn good Mexican food.  And the margaritas are fine...obviously a better bartender.  A beautiful setting and fine service.  So it's a solid 4!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place the location is great since it is right across from Chandler Mall.  The building looks cool and the decor is Diego Rivera inspired.  

-Service was good.
-Tables at the booth were a little too high.
-Plates were ridiculously hot.
-Food was well prepared, but for the most part it was VERY BLAND.

I give it 2 stars for lacking flavor."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a really nice ambiance. Colonial like setting. Staff is friendly and courteous 
We were seated promptly.  Our waitress so friendly helpful with the menu and quick to get our drinks

We ordered fajitas, overall it was ok, nothing extraordinary.  chicken had good flavor, but the beans needed salt and the Spanish rice was not impressive. 
We also ordered a chimichanga. It had solid flavor and good presentation
The fajita salad was really marginal. Greens felt like out of a bag. Steak Was under seasoned and cold

Overall a good place to have a nice lunch or dinner. Really good ambiance, but the food is marginal to OK."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's beautifully decorated and the service is excellent. I have been here a few times and each time was consistently great. They are more one the \"fine\" mexican cuisine scale. They make an avocado mousse, that's like guacamole, only better. It's silky and creamy and oh so delicious. Their queso dip was excellent as well. Try their dip sampler it has the two I listed and one other. I've had a taco plate here and a quesodilla, both excellent."}
{"text":"Living on the west side (especially the NW side) of phoenix, you will soon discover the splendors of a suburban, mostly caucasian demographic.  In other words, lots of chain stores and restaurants with most of the food tasting about the same.  That being said Abuelo's is a step above the rest around here.  If you're looking for authentic, high quality mexican food this isn't the place.  You'd be better served going to somewhere in Scottsdale, Phoenix or Tempe.  If you're trying to decide between Macayo's, Abuelo's, salsa blanca, top shelf, and carramba...then this is the place to go.  It can get a bit busy, so come here on the earlier side or expect to wait.  They got a great happy hour menu, and the food is pretty decent tex-mex.  Their salsas are pretty good.  Nothing you eat here will knock your socks off, but you won't be running home with diarrhea either.  If this place were located closer to better mexican options then I'd probably give them 3 stars, but since its the best in the area I'll grant them another one.  

TL;DR: Eat here if you're on the NW side and want tex-mex."}
{"text":"I would like to give this place 3 1/2 stars, but that option isn't really available now is it? 
I really do love the ambiance in spite of being a chain restaurant. The sky overhead with the statue in the middle of the restaurant is a really nice touch and the columns as well. It definitely feels a little different than other chain Mexican restaurants and for the better. 
It probably wasn't the brightest idea to go there yesterday afternoon on Cinco de Mayo, and we had to wait close to an hour for a table around 6pm, but we pretty much expected that. 
The food portions seem huge. My sister-in-law got the \"Nogales\" plate and I ordered the \"Juarez\" plate with a \"Mexican flag\" margarita. Yeah, I am not making that up. They actually called it the Mexican flag margarita...unless I was somehow mistaken, but I swear that's what the waiter said twice. I thought, \"Sure... let's try that one.\" It was pretty good. It tasted like a strawberry daquiri with hints of a margarita on the top. Perhaps, I should've mixed it more? It was awfully sweet though. I'm not sure if the salt on the rim really complimented the sweetness of the drink. Definitely not a drink for a guy though since it was frozen and sweet. 
Back to the Juarez plate. It had a crunchy beef taco with a red sauce, a cheese enchilada, a beef tamale, and chicken enchilada with beans and rice. This plate was off the \"Traditional Mexican\" section. It was pretty good for what it was. I couldn't tell you specific details about the flavor, because nothing really stood out. It was just good. I remember trying the chicken medallions plate at another visit, and that seemed to be more memorable. The fajitas in the past had been extra good too. 
Our waiter was really nice. He was covering so many tables though, and things were chaotic, so he only visited our table about 3-4 times tops the entire time. This meant empty waters and not asking me if I wanted another margarita. 
In summary, food and ambiance 3 1/2 stars. Service... 2-3 stars. I'm basing this solely on Cinco de Mayo afternoon. I'm almost positve service is better on other days (or at least I'm hoping so)!"}
{"text":"Terrible food straight of of a brick of veveeta cheese and porky rinds.... peach margarita was awful will never waste a thought on this place again."}
{"text":"Ouch, we visited in February and I realized  we were here once before but apparently I did not write a review. I know when the food is good because I forget to take pictures, hehe, both times I only had pics of the chips and salsa.
I came visit 2 more times and the food has always been good. Service has been from OK to great. Place is roomy and nice. Great for a business lunch or dinner. They have been flexible with the sides and accommodating for low carb requests."}
{"text":"The food here is bomb.. honestly I think one of the best Mexican spots I've been too.  5 stars! Nothing less."}
{"text":"What fantastic jalapeno poppers!  My sister and I visited here and were impressed with their quick service despite the dinner rush. The dulce de leche cheese cake was phenomenal.  We had it to go and ate it in the middle of the night!  Great service and great food.  My sister loved the avocado enchiladas.  The chile rellenos were very good as well.  They were very responsive and sensitive to food allergies and made sure we had nothing dangerous in our food."}
{"text":"Always have had  good food, great service, but tonight was even better. Doug was our server, good sense of humor , very attentive. Well, since I didn't finish my dinner, I carried it out to the car instead of my handbag. Almost home when I discovered my error, our  table was already taken, the server immediately went and retrieved my handbag. Thank you! Everyone !!"}
{"text":"I've had people take me here a few times but I'm going to have to call it quits after getting an avocado in my burrito. Not guacamole, just a whole unprocessed Avocado."}
{"text":"Good food and good ambiance.   Can get loud at times but still great ambiance."}
{"text":"Abuelo's is OK. There is nothing fantastic about it. I ordered the Juarez. I asked that the cheese enchilada be beef instead. I was told it would be no problem. That did not happen. It came out cheese. I sat at the bar.  The bartender was nice. Run of the mill service. If you come here just know you're walking into a run of the mill Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Just okay..... We had a very good waitress that kinda sorta saved the entire visit.  Salsa they serve here is from a can, but the chips are pretty decent and definitely made fresh in house.  This whole deal was overpriced in my opinion, almost $20 for chicken fajitas and $10 for a margarita.  This was my second time here and nothing has wowed me.  I will say that there was a lot of senior citizens here on both of our visits, maybe they have a secret senior discount menu?  After a small appetizer, a few cocktails and two regular dinners our total bill with tip was almost $100.  I'll go ahead and skip this place next time."}
{"text":"We went to Abuelos' for Mother's Day. I hadn't been there in a couple of years,so I really didn't know what to expect. Everything from the ambience,to the service,to the delicious food was more than I could have asked for. We had reservations at Ruth's Chris,but I am so happy that we stayed close to home. Kudos to Abuelo's for a wonderful experience.

It's now July 16th and had dinner with family at Abuelos. First of all the guacamole was horrible. Unripe avocado mixed with shreds of lettuce. Disgusting!"}
{"text":"I came to Abuelos with two friends on a Saturday evening. The restaurant was packed and I can understand why. The atmosphere is very nice and my friends really liked the faux sky on the ceiling. My server was awesome. I asked her if beef-stuffed sopapillas are available on the menu. She told me no, but she managed to get the chef to make them for me. This was probably the first time in Arizona history that beef-stuffed sopapillas were served in a restaurant. I posted a picture of my meal.

This type of service is extraordinary! Even the manager came by and asked me about the sopapillas. Our chips, salsa, and drinks were also refilled at appropriate times too.

Finally, I didn't think the food was breathtakingly amazing. It's just good Mexican food. I will definitely come back to this place more often."}
{"text":"Service was fine, above average building/decor, maybe that's the attraction, can't be the food.  Fajitas are so bland and I've had frozen dinner enchiladas that were much better.  There queso and salsas are hard to describe, I'm sure they make them fresh, but somehow they managed to make them seem like they came out of a jar, a cheap mass produces brand jar...bland."}
{"text":"Love their happy hour in the bar! They have three different kinds of salsa, the green one is the best. They also have a dip trio but they are very spicy! The margaritas during happy hour are a big fishbowl style and very delicious. The enchiladas plate with a sample of all of them is a lot of food and very flavorful, full enchiladas. A go to for good Mexican food in the west valley!"}
{"text":"Just had dinner here tonight to celebrate my mother in laws 70th birthday, being that is was a big night we called ahead made reservations which I appreciated that they accepted but let me say the service and food are definitely the reason they are receiving my 3 star rating today. We had a very friendly waiter but unfortunately you could see because he had our large party of 7 to attend and another table of 12 or more he could've used a few more hands. Our drink order took a smidge longer than it should have but we can deal with that, as far as the food goes.. tonight they ran out of the warmers to keep the tortillas hot, which seems unusual being you have a full kitchen in back? Not only that I ordered the cilantro lime rice as my side with meal and not just once but twice did they bring it to me almost completely cold or semi warm a 30 sec microwave bake. It was so disgusting that I couldn't bare to even ask for it a third time to be correct. The waiter did have the manager come over after he had already informed her the 1st time that the rice was cold but the 2nd time she just gave the fake is there a different side option I can offer you I feel she was the worst at the customer service at least the waiter genuinely cared when they brought the food out cold twice. She couldn't care less. It's unfortunate you had a staff member going to his supervisor for help and back up on a super busy night for something going wrong in the kitchen and she as the manager handled it wrong, I see this as poor upper management and sometimes the managers need to be evaluated under pressure situations because it's unfair when the waiter does try to correct the situation but your superior does nothing to help you."}
{"text":"The Grande burrito ground beef is big and yummy. I get the charro beans instead of the refried myself.."}
{"text":"Great Atmosphere here!

If you like fine dinning with your Mexican food, you'll love this place!

You'll be greeted by a host or hostess once you walk in. This place has a really nice theme and great style of culture.

You get chips and salsa once you are seated which is really cool. There is three different kinds of salsa with the chips. I really like the green colored one! 

I ordered an ultimate margarita on the rock without salt... The Margaritas here are really good! After about three of the ultimate one, I started to feel really good! Have to love the liquid courage! HAHA

Off the menu you I ordered the mini chimis, the beef ones. The meet was very delicious, and the sides were very nicely arranged. 

My overall experience here was really good! Next time I return here, I think I'll try the beergartita, and the enchiladas."}
{"text":"So haven't been here in probably 8 years and only went because my sister was visiting and wanted too. Was impressed on how nice restaurant has held up. Menu options were pretty amazing. But then the service started BOMB. Edward our waiter needs to find a different occupation SERIOUSLY he really has no clue how to take an order. After ordering drinks 15 minuets and no drink delivery we asked for and received a drink that we watched sit at bar for that time. The food pictured on menu looks nothing like food delivered. Food was mediocre at best. But the service was HORRIBLE. gotta give this place a big thumbs down!!"}
{"text":"When you have to debate between admiring the aesthetic beauty of the presentation of your food and stuffing your face with it, you know that you have a winner!  Such is the experience at Abuelos, without the five-star price tag.

The architecture is nice.  From the indoor sky that makes you feel like your walking through Caesar's Palace to the handmade ceramic plates, the place creates an ambiance that 99.9% of people will like.

Even if you are part of that .01%, I dare you to not enjoy the chips and salsa that are placed before you.  No, I'm not referring to the one salsa that they supply (like most restaurants in the area) which tastes like it's mixed with dirt like it's 1774 Sonoran food.  I'm talking about the green one in particular.  Lime, Tomatillo, Cilantro, and who knows what else is perfectly mixed to make you think that you've entered Heaven.  There is another red salsa to choose from and another is a spicy, Habanero mix.  But, the point is that the green sauce is awesome, and then you can experiment from there.

Now, with the menu before you, don't think too hard because it's hard to go wrong.  The lunch specials will likely stuff your face without breaking your bank (e.g. try the Grande Burrito).  Their happy hour also runs all week from 3-7PM and will definitely come through for you.

So, if you are looking for a Mexican restaurant in Northwest Phoenix which will be sure to deliver, go to Abuelos and thank me later!"}
{"text":"The first time I came here, we were with a party of 8 people. Although we called ahead and put our names on the list, when we arrived, they refused to seat us. They were holding the entire dining room for another party which wasn't going to arrive for another 2 hours. Eventually after some convincing & 45 minutes later, they let us sit down.

They did spill some food & drinks on a member of our party, so we got some free appetizers, well, OK (I would think we would get more than a compimentary trip to the eye wash station and some free apps, but whatever).

The food is pretty good, large portions but the presentation is atrocious. It's meat/veggies in some kind of sauce, just slopped on the plate. Mexican ingredients, so it tastes good, doesn't look good. Portions are huge and we all had leftovers to take home.

I've been here on a few other occasions as the food isn't terrible and they accomdate large groups. But you can do much better (although some coworkers came here one day and the service was so slow, eventually the entire meal was comped. So maybe you will win the poor-service lottery if you eat here!)"}
{"text":"Decided to only review after visiting a place twice. Been here twice. Had fajitas for two, twice. Both times, A-OK and reliably tasty! Chicken was juicy and had just enough flavor, steak was a bit fatty, but typically fajitas have a lower grade of beef anyways. Black beans were fresh and not from a can. Both Green and Red Peppers and onions were plentiful, however both times were warm and Not on a sizzling platter, which is why I dropped a star. It should be steaming.

5 stars that they offer Romaine leaves as a choice to wrap the ingredients instead of just tortillas. Try it; you'll love it, and it's a blast of healthy."}
{"text":"The most amazing margaritas....We have continued to come back for 2 years.  We often compare other Mexican resturants to Abuelos and 9 times out of 10 Abuelo's wins out!  Good food ...Good drinks...And a Good time!"}
{"text":"The bar is high in Arizona for Mexican cuisine, and Abuelos, you may or may not have a shot in Alaska.

This is a corporate chain, which makes it difficult to execute the details and freshness that makes Mexican my favorite. Always on the search for a good chicken fajita (or lobster, but that's another Yelp entirely) should not be a tall order. Give me limes and guacamole and I'm a happy camper. The chicken here is consistently dry whenever I visit Abuelos and bland. A friend we came with ordered a grilled chicken dish that came out fried, though the menu specified grilled. No bueno, mis amigos.

Check out Los Olivos. It's a few miles away, but the food and the donkey are well worth the journey."}
{"text":"Had dinner here while staying at the marriott next door. Great food and staff. The chips and salsa was mighty tasty. some hot some not. I had the tuna and taco's at happy hour. I say stop by.

Visited September 2011"}
{"text":"Lots of glitz and glam, little to back it up.

Food was meh... really expensive too.

Margs were good but I can get the same for cheaper. 
My friend got sick from the food she ate... 

Not impressed... never went back. nuff said"}
{"text":"Solid 3.5 stars. 

The dip trio was tasty. My pineapple infused margarita was great, too bad it's just barely a splash over ice for $8.25. My fajitas were yummy, I was pleased to find a variety of veggies (not just standard onions/green peppers) on my skillet. The portion was just right, enough for 3 tortillas w/no leftovers. Our server was nice/attentive but didn't not hover or ask questions when our mouths were full. 

The interior reminds me of a Vegas type of \"courtyard\"  restaurant enclosed in a hotel. Weird. Anyway, we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great Mexican entrees and restaurant decor.  Excellent service.  The upscale Mexican cuisine has \"Americanized\" the flavor with a few of the entrees.  Overall, great place for lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"We've been here a number of times.  The service is always consistent, the chips and salsa are always fresh, and the food is great.  Last time I was there I got the fajitas - and I subbed the green peppers for jalapenos - and I was pleasantly surprised to find they were fresh rather than jarred.  Very tasty, the only thing that keeps us from going more often is the long wait on weekends."}
{"text":"So we walked in and the place looked nice but it wasn't busy so that was a red flag. Salsa we ordered tasted watered down, like it was frozen and didn't taste good. My boyfriend ordered enchiladas and decided to try cheesy potatoes as a side instead of rice. It was instant potatoes!!!! Like they walked to Walmart next door and bought a ¢50 bag. I buy those myself so I know what it tastes like. Nothing tasted fresh, my shrimp were rubbery, fajitas were mostly onions and bland. Nothing was worth going back for. Plus it was wayyy too expensive. It was like you were paying for the scenery, and not the food. At Valle Luna right now and they're salsa taste so much better."}
{"text":"I wouldn't call it 'authentic'. My favorite for that is Los Dos Molinos, but Abuelo's is my favorite of the chain Mexican restaurants. My favorite is the Nogales which is basically two burros, one chicken and one shredded beef, with different sauces on each.

You should order: Papas con Chile as your side dish. YUM. Also, you can have two fried eggs added on top of your enchiladas, burros, whatever. I love that and not many places offer it."}
{"text":"i liked it.

veggie fajita was good. 'unlimited' gauco n other sides are really very tiny portion :D 

ambiance excellent.. though i didn't like any of the pictures hanging.

service was good"}
{"text":"On of the best chains.  Very big, spacious, high quality and yummy!  Went here with about 10 people. Our service was very slow- they brought out one drink at a time.  We were there for lunch and they knew ahead of time of how many would be attending.

Aside from that, it was really good."}
{"text":"Fantastic mexican food.  Their green salsa is amazing.  Everything I have ordered has been delicious.  You can't go wrong.  Our waitress Lacy was terrific.  She made my day.  When you have a great waiter that is everything."}
{"text":"Always enjoy my meals here. But this visit I had Anthony as my waiter.
So glad!
He pointed out that as my sides I had a choice of ANY of the six or seven options- not just rice and beans!
Wow
He mentioned the spinach casserole was really like spinach dip, and delicious.
I tried it. 
It rocked!
He then provided the best service I've had there- and on par with the best ANYWHERE!

Look at the menu for sides, and try something new. I got the cilantro lime rice and it was moist and yummy.
He also suggested I try the green sauce on my enchilada. Oh yea.... 

A great standby restaurant for very good food!
And Anthony, YOU rock!"}
{"text":"Abuelos is always great. It's super cool looking inside and it's a nice chill atmosphere. We went there for lunch after we watched a movie. We had great service and the food was tasty."}
{"text":"This is a very beautiful and grandly decorated restaurant. The food was ok. Nothing that really had me jumping for joy. I dined and some of the hole in the wall places that had my squealing with every bite. 

I tried their mango salsa and it was ok. It was a little too sweet and I was expecting savory.  The ultimate feast entree was enormous. It was enough to feed three people.  Tasty and overfilling is an understatement. The ambiance was very nice and the service was great. A little pricey. Thank goodness I wasn't paying."}
{"text":"We stopped here for lunch and found a big restaurant that's part of a larger regional chain of 40 locations. They actually started in Lubbock, Texas and moved West.
     Our server Nina was definitely a Keeper. She has a long tenure at this eatery.
The chip and salsa were a bit off. The chips are very thin and came stuck together.
The green salsa with pineapple was tasty but the other two red ones didn't get to first base. 
  The jalapeno cheese puffs were not too special. They were hollow inside with a small amount of jalapeno and a touch of sour cream.
    The main event was where they shine;
The enchilada plate with an avocado with cream enchilada was lights out. The ground beef
with chili was also tasty. The beans and special house mashed potatoes were great.
    The chili Relleno was way up there with a tasty poblano pepper and great picadillo.
The beef enchilada was a winner as was the beans and house potatoes. The fresh, hot, corn tortillas made a complete dinner.
    Having a Pro for our server made this a great experience. I found out that Abuelo's
honors our veterans with a nice discount. I asked because I recently found out that one of my favorite restaurants in San Antonio had been doing this for forty years and I just found out about this year."}
{"text":"Ok been going here for many years and it was always good based on food, service, and facility but last Saturday WHAT a change. Midday lunch not very busy was seated as usual quickly, table was a little messy, ordered our drinks they got to the table in decent time. The waiter on the other hand was slow. Almost to the point of wondering if he was okay to work. We ordered our food and I had to repeat my order as did my hubby both thinking hmmm that doesn't happen here? Before our food arrived we had devoured all of the salsa (which is very good) and asked for more upon our food arriving, well this is where they're losing a fourth star waiter never came back.... several minutes later almost at the end of our meal, he refilled my tea and I said um can we get that salsa we asked for? Without even so much as a sorry for failing to bring it out during our meal he just has a busser drop by with it. We don't speak to our waiter again he just runs by with our bill and keeps moving. Just plain inattentive service and over all the place needs updated.Sometimes the hostesses an be snotty too but they're 18-20 yo so what can you expect. Still giving 3 stars for the food."}
{"text":"Great food , atmosphere and great service. Will definitely go back again. We had the white sea bass, shrimp and scallop dish with rice and vegetables. Split with my wife and it was more than sufficient and very flavorful."}
{"text":"3.5. It's okay and I'm willing to try other items in the menu. Ordered Shrimp wrapped in Bacon Fajita. It was kind of disappointing for the price of 18.99. Sure price of shrimp went up this year, but still, for almost 20 bucks this dish is mediocre. Then, tasted \"The Monterrey\" for around 16-17 bucks I believe, I chose it cos it looked delish in the picture. Again, it was just okay but better than the Shrimp Fajita. Also ordered their Mucho Margarita, and that one was spot on. Will probably go here next time for happy hour and see what they offer. Service was borderline rude. I was with my parents that time, so I assumed I might whip up my ID just in case, and the server said \" I dont need the ID, it's okay\". Then I asked jokingly \"why do I not look you ng anymore?!\" (im 24 lol) and she said \"no not anymore\" with a couple of hahas. Gee, thankssss. But yeah anyway, minus that little situation, ambiance is pretty with fake coconut trees and cloud ceiling. Oh and btw, that skinny girl that's hostessing, don't put her there, she looked annoyed as hell on her job, not a very good start for the customers. But yeah, still Aok. Would go back for the drinks more so."}
{"text":"Yum! After reading several reviews about other Mexican restaurants in the area, I decided to take my friends to Abuelos and I'm so glad I did! We started off with the Dip Sampler which was yummy & hot! The chips were endless and the waitress happily accommodated our requests for a spicier salsa. My friends ordered the Avocado enchiladas and the beef enchiladas with a crunchy chicken taco on the side. Both couldn't stop raving about the fresh ingredients and authentic taste. I ordered the Shrimp Yucatan Fajitas. They came out sizzling and were delicious! 

The waitress was so friendly and helpful, the layout of the restaurant was authentic and kind of gave us a feel of the Venetian in Vegas with the high domed ceiling. I will definitely go back to Abuelos!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, reasonably priced, beautiful interior, awesome service, and conveniently located. Mexican food doesn't get better than this."}
{"text":"My colleague and I are working over in Middleton and thought we'd hit Abuelo's for lunch.

When we walked in, it seemed very much like a chain, and that's okay, but the hostess wasn't that friendly and there were only about 4 parties in the entire restaurant. Peak lunch hour. 12:30pm.

The menu is pretty standard 'Mexican' food with smaller portions on the lunch menu (back page). Everyone gets chips and three salsas (mild, medium, hot) as an appetizer, but for meals my colleague ordered the chicken enchiladas and I ordered the chicken fajitas. The chips were warm and seemed to be homemade, so that was a bonus.

While we were waiting for our food, there was a little computer game with a credit card swiper on it. We tapped a button and it said \"YOU ARE NOW PLAYING...\" however, we never had to swipe a card, so we didn't realize we were paying.

After 2-3 games of trivia, and a basket of chips, our food came. The chips and three salsas were fine and the lunch food was just \"okay\"; I felt underwhelmed. My coworker said his was fine, but we have definitely had better 'Mexican' food. Ah, well, we needed to eat lunch, right? It was fine for 'lunch.'

The bill came and our meals were correct, except...the games were charged to our table! There were our trivia games, right on our bill. This is EXTREMELY misleading because you don't swipe your credit card on the machine and it doesn't say it's being added to your tab. 

We are so disappointed by this and bring it to our server's attention. We explain how it's extremely misleading and there should be note that says games are added to your tab. Seriously, why would we think we would be charged if it didn't make us swipe our card in the machine?

Anyway, the server fixed it, but it was really disappointing, so don't play the games on the little machine. Even if you never swipe your card, you will be charged.

All in all, I wouldn't eat here again, i wasn't super impressed by the food and from the looks of it, neither are others. It just didn't seem all that flavorful and for the price, i'd rather go to Quaker Steak and Lube."}
{"text":"Wouldn't normally go to a place like this, but I was traveling, it was close and I was hungry.  Service was good, but the food was horrible!  Ordered Fajitas and all the vegetables were burnt to a crisp!  Guy next to me had the same thing and had the same issue.  When he complained the manager gave us half off the food."}
{"text":"Awesome food!! I thought everything was really good here.. Chips and salsa were great too and service was very good."}
{"text":"Excellent service!

Prompt, fast and very friendly. Thank you Jose for great experience!"}
{"text":"This is me and my husbands favorite place to eat by far. We love everything we have ever gotten to eat. The food is always fantastic and the drinks are unique and tasty. The service has always been great and the restaurant is clean with a very interesting and creative ambiance. We will continue to go back."}
{"text":"I love Abuelos!  My friend from Texas first told us about this place and we were not dissappointed!  We gladly drive to Peoria for our \"Mexican fix\"!  (We were sad when they closed our nearby Scottsdale location.)  Their salsa is the best and my son loves the extra spicy one.  Chips are always fresh and warm.  My personal favorite is the cheese and chicken enchiladas - with the pappas!  Yum!  My hubby and son love the Pescaro Guerro (Mahi fish dish).  Although we are pretty predictable with our choices, they are always great.  Margaritas are very tasty and there is no skimping on the alcohol.  Highly recommend a visit to this one..."}
{"text":"Enjoy gluten free options but wish they'd add chicken dish. Also wish they'd make gluten free papas. Cilantro rice is good and gf chips. Nice atmosphere.  Patio is great during cooler weather"}
{"text":"My friends and I come here often for the great Happy Hour beverages! Classy, tasty Mexican food without all of the excess grease. Great ambience, with many places to sit. There isn't a bad seat in the place. Whether you're at the counter, in the bar or in the main room, the service is always amazing. One of the servers by the name of Ryan is exceptional! He's quick and attentive and checks in often. He has always been happy to help us and it is greatly appreciated! We love this place and will always be frequent customers."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant of all time! I have been going since I was a kid and it's nothing short of delicious! The location is a little hidden but it's a large beautiful building. 

The restaurant itself is gorgeous. There is a waterfall in the center and the roof is painted with clouds and very bright so it almost feels like your sitting in a outdoor patio. Service is always great.

They start your meal out with a bowl of chips and 3 salsa's. a hot, mild, and refreshing green salsa. The green is amazing! I could drink it. It's a combination of cucumber, pineapple, ect so it's not your typically salsa. Great appetizer I recommend is the jalapeño cheese fritters and for a meal the chicken fajita chimichanga is incredible! Their enchiladas and fajitas are really good too! 

Between great atmosphere, great service and excellent food I highly recommend to go here for your Mexican cravings. I always bring friends and family from out of state and they love it!"}
{"text":"Everything we had was great. Unexpected pineapple in salsa verde, papas, enchiladas and steak chimichanga will definitely have us going back."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch one day with some fellow coworkers and I must say overall I wasn't impressed. The service was incredible however the food itself didn't particularly match up.  I ordered basically a soft beef taco and enchilada which came with rice and fried beans. The soft taco was a bit plain (could get the same quality at a Taco Bell) and the enchilada was ok however it just tasted like melted American cheese covered it. The meat itself in both weren't seasoned well. Not much taste.  I wouldn't get the dish  again and to be honest I don't think I'll visit this restaurant again. There are better Tex Mex and Mexican restaurants around the city I'd check out first prior to coming  here again."}
{"text":"Food is fabulous.  Service is courteous, helpful, and attentive.  Prices are reasonable and portions are good size."}
{"text":"Food was on point and delicious. Will make this place a regular Sunday family spot. Waitress was fast and friendly drink did not go empty always there to refill."}
{"text":"Oh Abuelo's why can't you have a location in Denver?!?! 

We came by here Saturday night and there was a hour wait so we went somewhere else, but came back today before we head home to denver. We visited the Peoria Az location. The reason I give this review 4 stars is because the hostess was a bit rude. Luckily the server, atmosphere and the food made this a short lived issue. 

We are a big family and for lunch they sat us within 5 mins or so. The server was right out and brought drinks and chips and salsa quickly. The small salsa trio dish is a bit weird and small for a Mexican restaurant but really isn't a issue. The dark salsa is really good, minimal heat but has a really good roasted chili flavor to it. We also ordered the queso, this was excellent.

My wife ordered chicken fajita and really enjoyed them but was disappointed there was no sizzle. The excitement is in the sizzle as they bring them to the table but apparently this isn't the deal here. 

I ordered the grande, man what a huge meal. And the flavor was incredible. The enchiladas are incredible. 

Bottom line is if you like Texmex this spot should be your go to. The flavors are rich, the portions are large and atmosphere is pretty cool. We'll definitely be checking out Abuelos again in a few months when we're in Texas."}
{"text":"I have eaten here 6 times over the last 7 years and had good experiences.  My family and I weent early for Mother's Day dinner and I saw a shift in service and food quality.  On the plus side, the the Dip Sampler appetizer was one of the best I had.  But the service was very slow even when our waitress went down to 3 tables.  My wife's drink, ordered when we sat down, took 20 minutes to arrive.  She had a special request for the drink and it was ignored.  I had the Beef & Cheese Chimichanga.  It was VERY BAD.  The ground beef was either old or spoiled and it tasted sour.  I took two bites and stopped.  The waitress looked at me and said, \"You don't like it?  Still deciding, huh?\"  and then walked away.  She came back 15 minutes later and I kindly requested that it be taken off the bill.  She said a manager would come by the table, but he or she never did.  The charge was taken off the bill.  My wife's entree - the Juarez - and my daughter's Child's Beef Taco were fine.  My son's Fajita Tacos looked liked they were literally thrown together with no attempt at presentation.  When my family was finished eating their entrees, the waitress said she would bring the check and didn't ask us if we would like dessert or anything else.  Some may chalk off  my bad experience to it being Mother's Day, but if  restaurant can't give good service and great food when busy, why would you want to go there in the first place?"}
{"text":"I must say I had a very good experience eating here which makes me want to come back. This is an intimate type atmosphere a little loud but still cozy and relaxing. I had the best waiter ever Isreal, he was very attentive very respectful great attitude and just an over nice guy that made my dinning experience great. The food was tasteful a little on the pricey side. They do offer a happy hour I believe 3 to 7 in which their margaritas are 3.00 off and 1.00 off beers. Just remember this is not your ordinary mexican food so have a open mind when eating here. There tortilla soup is really good too."}
{"text":"I love the decor :) we ordered the matamoros and chicken fajita chimi to go. Vic provided excellent service and recommendations at the bar. I definitely want to come back!"}
{"text":"This is a great value for Mexican food. They have recently made some improvements to their food quality. 

The fajita meat is better quality than it used to be, more tender. The dip sampler is a great pair with the chips for an appy. The enchiladas are good and the Manjar (layered flat enchiladas with an egg on the top) is the best.

Service is consistent and friendly. Wish they had Splenda on the table instead of having to ask for it every time. I guess the Sun City crowd must be filling their pockets if they leave it out :-)

It's time to revamp the booths, some of the seating is a bit worn, but overall a nice place to get some Mexican food and a good price with well-trained service.

Tends to get busy near weekends at supper."}
{"text":"This place is just AMAZING !!! Great service , great food (quality food) the portions for the price are very good and the speed of service was extremely good ! I had the alborada pork and enchiladas and YUMMY , my margarita was a bit bitter but I finished it all ( I guess I did like it ) . Please come and try this place - our server was very polite and knowledgeable. Thank you Abuelos"}
{"text":"Came here after a padre spring training game. Made it for happy hour . Decent margarita for $5.99. Great service!!!! Food okay, did enjoy the \"papas\" mashed potatoes instead of rice. Just OK..."}
{"text":"Amazon decor... front looks like a museum and there was such beautiful paintings and murals inside. Our waitress was really on top of her game with a group of 10.

Food was average :
- chips and salsa : best part of the meal... the green pineapple salsa dip was amazing! Would love a jar of this at home.
- enchilada combo #2 : shredded beef topped with queso and green chili cause... eh OK. The tortillas that they were wrapped in was somewhat rubbery. 
- margarita pie : tad too sweet and doesn't taste much different from a standard key lime. 

Decent Mexican place for (business) groups as there is something for everyone... but nothing out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"Was shopping with my son, daughter and her fiancé Sat afternoon and I said I was hungry and daughter said she wanted tamales and I was like no, I'm not getting tamales, I want a burger, so we kept shopping and then I said are you guys up to trying something new, and they said yea, so I said let's try Abuelos, and man are we glad we did! 

When we got their we 1st ordered the Abuelos dip sampler, which had a cheese dip, a bean dip and their avocado cream, which was like a guacamole whipped with air, not my fav, but everyone loved the bean & cheese dip. Also ordered a pineapple infused maragarita, man that was delish!!


I ordered the Nogales, which was beef & chicken rolled into a flour tortilla enchilada style, that my friend was a perfect dish!! Others ordered the Sonora, Tilapia Veracruz, beef and cheese enchilada combo! All the dishes were perfect and delish!! The heat was there I was a happy camper!! Love the spicy food!!! 

Look forward to coming back and trying other items on the menu! 
Oh by the way the daughter that wanted tamales, never ordered them, she went with the enchiladas LOL"}
{"text":"Love the feel and atomphere of the place.  Feels like I am eating in the middle of Casear's Palace with the indoor blue skies.  But the food and service was nothing specatacular.  Service was a little on the slower side.  The food was ok.  

Ordered the beef and cheese chimichanga (I love chimis).  The flavors was just ok.  Nothing popped or made me sing (in my head)."}
{"text":"Last night I met up with my Wife and my In-Law's at Abuelo's to celebrate my Father in Law's birthday, I arrived late to dinner after working late, but My Wife was nice enough to set aside some appetizer nacho's for me. Let me start with the decor, this place is a blend somwhere between a nightclub with large glass doors and ambient light, and a Central Mexico villa, complete with faux sky fresco on the ceiling of the central dining room, all centered around an odd statue of a man in a poncho and a child in dining room.  Confused decor aside let's talk about the food.

the Nacho's I had we're actually very good, they appeared to be hard taco sized tortilla's broken in half with a bit of melted cheese taco meat, lettuce and sour cream on them.  My Wife told me about this greenish hot sauce the waiter put on the table that he said was really hot, and no one else at the table was daring enough to try.  Generally liking spicy food, I gave it a shot, it had a little kick, but nothing like some hot sauces I've tasted, nontheless I doused my nachos with it.

For dinner I ordered the Alambre De Camarones, which was essentially 6 large shrimp wrapped in bacon, stuffed with peppers, served with a queso sauce for dipping.  The dish was also served with rice and broccoli (which I found odd)

The shrimp was very good, dipping bacon wrapped shrimp in cheese may sound a bit decadent, but you might want to try it.  The rice is nothing you can't get anywhere else, but still not bad. The thing that kept this from being a four star review was the choice of Broccoli as a side. I know broccoli isn't unheard of in mexican cooking, I recognize the difference between Tex-Mex and what would be called Mexico City food.
Maybe I'm just being a picky little kid that doesn't want to eat his vegetables (which I did, the cheese helps). It just seemed like an odd pairing to me.

My wife had a an enchilada combo plate with beef and chicken which she let me taste and it was really good, any both her and my Father in Law's meals were served with these tasty papas with cheese and poblano peppers in them.  Which I secretly wish I had instead of the broccoli.

All in all the meal was pretty filling, tasty and our server was attentive, so I can't really complain. and would return to Abuelos"}
{"text":"So I am in the the Middleton, WI area for work.  I am basically in the middle of nowhere.  I find a gem in Abuelo.  

Service: Good
Margarita's: FAB
Allows me to order a la carte: Check

Very enjoyable.  I will definitely return since I will be in the area for a few weeks."}
{"text":"Just so so definitely not worth what I paid for it
Lunch fajitas, dry dry chicken onions and peppers not browned at all
Literally a teaspoon of pick told unlimited puck came with the regular order for 4 more dollars...really???!!!!
So sad you guys are terrible
Beans were still crunchy and yet they wanted to bring me out more , they were not cooked, really I don't want them"}
{"text":"We've been here twice.  The first time I thought it was great.  Chips and salsa were really good.  Waiter asked us if we liked a hotter salsa and brought some out.  Margaritas were good too.  I had the Enchiladas de Cozumel.  Crepes filled with guacamole and topped with a white wine sauce and shrimp, scallops, spinach and roasted red peppers.  OMG....it was so yummy.  Ridiculously fattening and bad for you, but yummy!  Second time we sat on the patio, which is kind of depressing, and we were the only people out there.  The dish I ordered was not great either.

So, one great experience, one average.  I'm sure we'll go back though."}
{"text":"Great food and professional staff. We had a delicious business lunch with very little interruption! Great acoustics so easy to talk while enjoying our food. I will definately be back."}
{"text":"It used to be much better. Shrimp chowder was the best soup there and although it was available, it isn't on the menu. The lunch special was below average in portion compared to nearby Espo's more authentic food just down the street. It's definitely feels nice inside but very \" commercial\" rather than authentic."}
{"text":"Went last Friday and had a 45 minute wait but it was worth it. Food and margaritas were both good. I'd go back."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food. Variety of dishes including seafood, beef & chicken. They have a gluten free menu and you can also get gluten free chips & salsa to start (no charge). Their regular tortilla chips have wheat. 
What sets this place apart is their options for side dishes. They have pinto beans simmered with bacon (so good), a potato side dish with cheese (again so good), cilantro white rice, regular refried beans, etc. 
The kids meal is a good size too. 
Service is always outstanding."}
{"text":"If you are looking for Authentic Mexican Food...Just go to your local Mexican restaurant by your house. The chips and dip are great as well as the drinks. I like how they have variety of different dishes, all which are good. I would not pay $8 for tacos here cause you will be very disappointed. 

Came here with a bridal dinner and was great. Staff caters to the party and has numerous waiters on hand."}
{"text":"Been there a few times and in the past I really enjoyed it but the last two times we have gone the food has been subpar. Today for lunch the queso was gross and just tasted like canned nacho cheese and the rest of the food was bland and not so appetizing. Not sure why the quality has gone down so much."}
{"text":"Abuelo's is probably the best Modern Mexican restaurant in the valley.
We absolutely love that they have happy hour everyday in their bar area! Their appetizers are so good! Drink specials are also great!! And, if you love chips and salsa, they have great chips and three types of salsa served every time! The green salsa is my favorite. We will usually get if you appetizers and then share a meal. Everything from their enchiladas and tacos to their beans and papas (potato) sides are so tasty. The jalapeño fritters are so cheesy and crispy. The guacamole dip is so fresh and is perfect with their chips. We love The Monterrey dinner is huge and we love the variety of enchiladas. 
I will warn you, their portions for dinners are gigantic! Be prepared to have leftovers."}
{"text":"Abuelos was great! Was here with my boyfriend and have enchiladas and queso and they were both amazing! Had the firecracker shrimp and that was the best!!! Felicia was our server and she was awesome! Her suggestions were not only helpful but delicious! Also had the margarita that come in martini glass made with 1800. Best margarita I have ever had! And it comes with a shaker that is equivalent to two full martini glasses!! Definitely coming back!! Sun thru Friday $3 off all drinks too!!"}
{"text":"Went to Abuelos tonight for a birthday dinner. My boyfriend has never been here before but now it's his favorite place for enchiladas.  Had the Monterey dish . He loved it. I liked my dinner also. Good service."}
{"text":"A taste of home (Lubbock) in AZ!  Always a great meal!

Ask for the hotter salsa!"}
{"text":"Great Mexican food restaurant, the portions are huge, so if your on a budget it is easy to split. If I want sit down Mexican this is my first choice by far. Prices are decent, very clean, and people are friendly."}
{"text":"I'm from Texas so Abuelo's is a little taste of home.   I chose this as my Mother's Day dinner and I wasn't disappointed.  The service was excellent.  They were attentive and kept us full of chips and salsa until our meal arrived.  It was all I'd hoped it would be and I was not disappointed."}
{"text":"It's OK, not sure about \"Mexican\" but nice atmosphere and very good service, very clean place."}
{"text":"not super authentic at all, chips are soo good, but salsa is kind of weird but still good. I dont know why but old people love this place! I like the chips with queso dip for apps then chicken enchaladas, classic but really good! Friendly hosts but waiters could know more about the product! over all I think it gets lost in the many mexican restaurants in AZ, and higher prices for the same food."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, and both times I was not at all disappointed. The food is fresh and hot and tastes amazing. Love the inside design as well. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I thought it was okay. The happy hour specials were awesome. I recommend it by far for happy hour. For me I thought the food was okay. I don't think it's really traditional Mexican food. I was very unimpressed."}
{"text":"Our trip to Abuelos Arrowhead was a VERY pleasant surprise. We live in Cave Creek, and were disappointed when the Mayo location closed. So, we trekked out to Arrowhead. The service upon arrival was fast, smooth, excellent. Our server very personable and helpful! George, the manager, went above and beyond the call of duty for our gluten-free daughter. And, he was very personable and professional! What a great lunch experience! Thank you, George!! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place is great!! I've always seen it because we go to Harkins movie theater right next to it, but never went in until Friday!! First of all- the ambiance is pretty cool!! Not what I was expecting but it's very relaxed and welcoming!! Second- the drinks at happy hour are very very good, I recommend the sangria swirl! The chips and dip that they bring you are also very good! It's nice to have 3 different salsas to choose from! Super cool :). Third- the food was magnificent!!! I had the Durango burrito and it was AWEEEESOMEEEE!!! Our waiter was very nice, very prompt. It was just an overall awesome experience! Would definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"We've been coming to Abuelo's for a while. Originally from New Mexico so it's pretty hard finding an actual authentic Mexican restaurant. 

Surprisingly the salsa's offered as soon as you come in range from sweet to spicy which is a good thing if you like hot salsa or mild. 

I always order the enchiladas which never disappoint. 

The service here usually varies. We've had a handful of good servers but there is always an occasional bad server. She must've been having a bad day. 

Overall, great food and environment."}
{"text":"In a word, \"Ew!\"

My honey and I, in a moment of Mexican food desperation, stopped by Abuelo's because we've heard good things. 

People lie.

The chips were thin, which I normally like, but they were so thin they couldn't support the salsa. The salsa left much to be desired. While flavorful, the taste was surprising. And not in a good way. (Kind of like when you order a Coke in the drive-thru and end up with Dr. Pepper instead.)

The margaritas were deceivingly generous. I filled my glass three times, but the alcohol content was very low. Were it not for the calories, I could have had five or six of them and still cleared a breathalyzer.

As for the actual meal, I don't know where to begin. I have had better Mexican food frozen from a box than I was served at Abuelos. The sauce tasted heavy of preservatives and more like something you'd get from a can. The pork and the beef on both of our dishes was chewy, and too, more like something you'd get from a can. Honestly, the whole meal was just ick.

The only possible redeeming aspect of the meal could have been dessert, but, alas, they don't serve your traditional Mexican desserts. Fried ice cream is not to be found anywhere on the menu. Of course, fried ice cream doesn't come in a can, so.. there ya have it.

I would avoid this restaurant. If you're in the mood for Mexican and are in the area, see some of my other reviews."}
{"text":"I had the privilege of visiting the establishment last night because I was in the area and I had a $25 gift card that was given from Christmas last year.  I was quite excited - I get to use my gift card and I don't have to pay for my whole meal!  Score!

So we get to the restaurant and the ambiance and décor remind me of a dim Cheesecake Factory - restaurant was open, nice, and chain-like. We get seated and we order the sangria. Sangria was good and strong - my kind of drink!  Then we get the complimentary chips and salsa - eh, ok.

My bf and I order the Monterrey.  It was a big plate enough for two people: Sour cream chicken enchilada, avocado enchilada, spinach enchilada, chicken ranchera enchilada, cheese chile relleno, crispy chicken taco and guacamole. 

We started chowing down and every bite I took tasted like the last - no matter which part of the plate I was eating. The food was bland and lacked flavor.  I was so disappointed!  Luckily, my sangria was kicking in, so my disappointment did not ruin my happy mood.

The check came and for the two of us, we spent close to $50."}
{"text":"The first time my husband and I went here, the waitress was pretty rude. She didn't smile at us, and was very cold. I thought she was having a bad day, and decided to give her the benefit of the doubt. But I then noticed her smiling and being courteous to other tables, which made us feel unwelcome.. We visited again this weekend and we had a different waitress. She was worse! She didn't smile at all and even had a glum look on her face. She was just not at all happy we walked in. She reluctantly took our drinks order, and then entrees order. When we were done with our meal, a couple walked in but she was friendly with them. One thing we noticed in common with the 2 waitresses was that they were rude in the beginning and throughout, but just as they were clearing our plates and giving us the check they were friendly, just in time for us to give them a good tip. My husband is one of the nicest people I know, and he's known for over tipping. He himself suggested a 10% tip was enough.

I'm not one to ever pull out the race cars but maybe they don't want people of other races in here. The Caucasian/white people (the only race we noticed both times in there) were taken care of well. But they were both rude to us and wouldn't even top off our chips, and the waitress didn't notice this, we requested. Maybe they need to put up a sign outside so we can be warned instead of being insulted.

Abuelo's, you have lost our business. And too bad, we live less than 5 minutes away and frequently eat at PF Chang's. The only reason I gave one star is for your food, which I must say is pretty good."}
{"text":"My family loves Abuelo's! The guacamole is great, lunch specials are awesome, kids meals are perfect, service is always great, chips and salsa are yummy plus you can ask for the spicier salsa which is great, burritos are always good, flour enchilada is good, good margaritas and it's an upscale atmosphere.I am from Chandler so I've tried all mexican places and this is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants in Chandler!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat. The food was great and we enjoyed the atmosphere. Also, prices are very reasonable for what you get. We ordered 3 meals, an appetizer, 2 drinks, 1 adult drink, and desert and the bill was still under $60. The enchiladas there , especially the pork carnitas, were excellent"}
{"text":"Love this place. it's a must when people come visit from out of town. the food is great, and the prices aren't bad.  The staff is hit or miss.  never seen a manager going around before... but if you want to be left alone and EAT.. then your good. nice and clean place. patio is nice if you don't get some family with brats next to you while your on a date night but that's not the resaurant's fault it was that bad mom's. :)"}
{"text":"Very good food.  Nice ambiance.  AND they make a heckuva mojito!"}
{"text":"Decent.

The hostess was MIA for a bit, so everyone was kind of just loitering near the front waiting to be acknowledged and seated. It angered an older couple waiting before me, but I wasn't too worried about it. *shrug*

The server was nice, he happily described the three different sauces to me. (and let's face it, they're all tasty!) The chips were disappointing though. Pretty cold, and they were so thin they broke apart with the dip.
That's not a deal breaker though. so... *shrug* again

I ordered the chicken 'fabulous fajitas'-- comes with unlimited tomatoes, guacamole, sour cream, lettuce, cheese, and two sides. I got mexican rice and smashed potatoes. They were okay. They were very small portions and the rice was almost cold by the time I got to it, but the potatoes were extremely hot. haha, oh well. so another *shrug* once more

So all in all, it's a decent place. However, I spent $16 on a meal that I only found \"decent\". Maybe I'm stingy, but if I'm paying $16 to feed myself/have a dining experience, I don't want to shrug throughout the whole thing.

P.S.
[ Also people think they have to dress fancy when they come here because of the decor. But honestly, I don't think it matters. The food isn't fancy enough for me to dress up for. No sweatpants though. (But that's just anywhere.) ]"}
{"text":"Our server, Chip, was awesome! Very fun, friendly, and helpful. In spite of the \"rush\" of the dinner crowd he gave us attention and did so in a calm and composed manner. 

The food was great! Two of us got \"the Monterey\" and the other got the \"Enchiladas de Cozumel.\" We also got an appetizer of three dips. All was delicious. 

I also liked the wall murals and nifty technology at the tables that allowed us to pay without waiting."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the lunch. Husband had a salad & they put a hot pepper on as garnish without telling him. Rather burned his tongue & lips. Tho other than that the salad was excellent. Took granddaughters and they enjoyed too. First time we ever used a pay at the table machine. Girls had fun paying the bill and reviewing the service. Which was very good."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I came in here a while ago and I am hoping to help someone else from paying for this overpriced, greasy food. No wow factor for me at all. The service was mediocre as well."}
{"text":"OMG! I cannot believe we haven't been here yet after living nearby for over a year. Best Mexican sit down restaurant in Glendale. Drinks were always filled. Chips were refilled. More salsa was brought out too. The Grande Burrito was the best thing ever. Over stuffed and so so good. We will be back. Thank you to Manny (the server) for taking great care of us."}
{"text":"Loved the firecracker tacos! Beautiful presentation of food, great atmosphere, and welcoming staff."}
{"text":"I've eaten here many times but only on Saturdays for lunch.  I think it's a very attractive restaurant, bright and cheerful and the service was always prompt and very pleasant.  The chips and dips always arrived almost immediately.   I decided since I liked it so much to bring my family here on Sunday to celebrate my sons birthday.  We were given a table in a less than attractive section and then the wait started...it took a very long time for the chips and dips to be placed on our table and by that time we had read the menu several times.  
And so we waited until finally a waitress took our orders.   I specifically told her no beans and substituted the mashed potatoes...the dish came with rice.  And then we waited and waited....went through about 6 baskets of chips.   Finally the food arrived and of course mine was wrong..there was that ugly little bowl of beans anon rice,  I told the young man who brought our food to take the beans back.   My son gave me his rice.  The meal otherwise was fine, but after eating so many chips while waiting, it did take the edge off.   For his birthday, my son was offered a choice of desserts...he selected he chocolate lava cake and that was very nice.  A manager came over and apologized for the error with my order and offered another dessert.....my grandchildren also wanted the chocolate lave cake and so we all had a taste.  I'll probably come back with friends for lunch but NEVER on a Sunday."}
{"text":"Always love going to Abuelo's. Food is reasonably priced. Great open atmosphere. The food is always good and consistent. I have never had a bad meal there. Service is always attentive. Nothing bad to say. It may not be amazing (it is very good), but you will never leave disappointed."}
{"text":"Had a late lunch at this place for the first time last month. It was pretty slow at the time we went. I liked how the restaurant looked on the inside, it has a beautiful fountain when you walk in. 
I tried their Watermelon Margarita and was pleasantly surprised. It was not too sweet or too tequila-y. 
The chips and salsa that are brought to the table were so-so, fairly spicy. They had there different types they brought to the table and they  mixed a bit of the three on a plate. 
I ordered a burrito and my coworker had the fajitas, neither of us were impressed. My coworker had been there a few times prior to our visit and she was disappointed in how things tasted. 
Not some place I would go back to again. I'd rather drive all the way to Pedro's or go to pasqual's."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here Monday evening and it was my first time.  We kept avoiding it because my husband went to the one in Indianapolis and said it was bad.  I loved it and my husband did too!  He said he was pleasantly surprised.  We split fajitas and had margaritas which were excellent!  Get them at happy hour and they're huge and inexpensive.  We will definitely being going back again and again!!!"}
{"text":"We happened to pay a visit to this restaurant for our girls lunch and we couldn't have chosen a better place. The ceiling in the center courtyard reminds you of Venetian at Las Vegas. The place is decorated with wall arts and artificial plants around. We didn't see much crowd for a Saturday lunch and were seated in a minute. 

As we sat, we were given freshly made tortilla chips and salsa. The chips were thin and crispy, salsa was ok for my taste. They have a wide menu option and we ordered jalapeño cheese fritters for appetizers. It was more of cheese fritters, there was very slight hint of jalapeño. We further ordered tilapia tacos, firecracker shrimp tacos and vegetarian fajitas. One can chose flour or corn tacos.  The tacos was served with cilantro rice and beans. The rice was one of the best I have had, wasn't impressed with the bean though. Full points for the tacos, right amount of shrimp, veggies and pieces of mango. I loved how it was not filled with lettuce, which made it easier to eat. The fajita qty is a lot for one person with rice and beans along. The taste was alright but not as good as the tacos. 
We finished our meal with caramel flan, the showstopper. The flan was rich, creamy and moist. Loved every bit of it. The price is average and would recommend this place for any Mexican food lover."}
{"text":"The ambiance in this restaurant is really nice, especially for a Mexican restaurant. I immediately felt it was a good choice by the handsome decor and level of cleanliness.

The chips and salsa were delicious. The chips were the very thin, crispy chips that I love and are hard to find at grocery stores. 

I ordered the lunch enchiladas accompanied by rice and beans, both of which were delicious. The food was a tad salty, but was very good.

My husband ordered the tilapia Vera Cruz and enjoyed it but wasn't blown away. Good blend of seasoning and good portion of veggies, but small portion of tilapia compared to the photo on the menu. The fish and shrimp were cooked very well.

In addition our waitress was very professional and answered all of our questions with good knowledge of the restaurant. One other plus, the food came out piping hot which I usually have a hard time with at restaurants.

Would definitely return."}
{"text":"This some really bland Mexican food... Reminds me of a tex mex version of chi chis. The setting is nice..a little upscale - good service - but the food is just 'ehh..'."}
{"text":"They named it Abuelos for a reason! Authentic mexican good straight out of your grandparents kitchen. 

It was wonderful, but the portions are HUGE. Share with your significant other, friend, random person sitting next to you or even that mariachi boy over there singing his heart away. 

Love the decor also.   Estaba buenismo! Gracias por la comida, Abuelos!"}
{"text":"I had never been to this restaurant before & was pleasantly surprised.  The food was excellent, the service was fast & the atmosphere great.  You can pay your bill at a machine at the table which is super cool.  I'd give it a 10!"}
{"text":"When I walked in I was impressed, it's Beautiful, it's has this inside outside kinda feel with the courtyard setting. 

The menu was extensive and everything sounded delicious. I saw food that looked really good being served to other tables.

Unfortunately the food was not as good as it looked and certainly not as good as the restaurants interior would have you believe.

I got a taco and enchilada combo, the taco shell was a generic hard shell like those found at Taco Bell, the chicken inside ( I Kid you not) was the exact same chicken used at Taco Delmar  and the meaty enchilada sauce well, it must have been by  Hormel.

Everything had a different kind of peppery tasting spice that did not work well competing against each other.

It's like the Rainforest Cafe  of Mexican food."}
{"text":"Wow, what a difference a talk made. After I had posted here I had also commented on Abuelo's Website. I was contacted by the Assistant General Manager via E-mail a few days later. She asked if we could talk by phone. So I gave her my phone number and she called me the next day. 
She apologized sincerely about the terrible service and food we received and said she would send me 4 VIP Vouchers for free meals.
Her name is Jennifer Dils and she followed through on her promise. 
So we went back on Friday, April 3rd, 2015. We were promptly seated and it wasn't until our server, his name is Will, came to our table to ask for our drink order that I gave him the free meal cards and asked for Mrs. Dils. She came to our table shortly and introduced herself. Mrs. Dils was extremely professional and courteous and it was truly a pleasure meeting her.
Will, even before meeting Mrs. Dils, was very nice and quick and throughout our entire visit was very attentive, without disturbing our little party. 
We had brought my Son along and again, my parents. 
My Father and I had opted for the Chicken Fajitas, The Chicken was juicy, well seasoned, the Onions and Bells underneath it nice and translucent.
My Mom had the Fajita Burito with the Chicken and Chili Con Queso on top. She really enjoyed her meal. The only thing was that she ordered all Rice and received Rice and Beans. But that was not such a big deal. 
My Husband and Son both had the Ribeye & Enchilada and chose the Cheese Enchilada. They asked for the Ribeye to be medium rare and it may have been just a tad more rare, but they both loved it.
We had the Guacamole and Chili Con Queso for the appetizer. Both were delicious, loved the Guacamole the most. We had it on our last visit and again, we were not disapointed.  The Salsa this visit around, was very good, it was not runny like it was on our previous visit. The only thing I don't care for is the Green Salsa. It is a little to sweet for my taste, buy my Dad liked it. 

Overall, this was the Abuelos I remember and we will definitely return again. I hope the excellent service and food will become the norm again and want to thank the Assistant Manager Mrs. Dils once more for addressing our complaint and making sure that all was well. She even came at the end of our meal to check on us. 

Thank you Abuelo's for what turned out to be a great return visit."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times and both times I got a platter called Los Mejores de la Casa, the food was good although the sides did seem a bit bland, but I wouldn't really call this dish a Mexican dish, the chocolate flan was yummy, the restaurant is very nice looking inside and out..."}
{"text":"Great service, great drinks, great food...
Normally I post for miles, but it's just that simple here. First time in and we'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I am vegan. Finding restaurants that cater to vegans is extremely difficult. Abuelo's has a vegetable fajita dish that can be customized to be vegans. It is absolutely delicious. The servers are wonderful as well. I also love the atmosphere. This is probably my favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"I have patronized Abuelo's locations for many years for many years including in TX where they are based and on Chandler Blvd here in our area.
Both food and service have always been great.
First and only time to this specific location in Arrowhead did not provide good service.
Manager did take the time to listen to our concerns but it was a bit late."}
{"text":"This place is just OK.  Chain restaurant Mexican food is a hard sell for me living in Arizona.  Chips and salsa are one of my favorite parts of going out to a Mexican place, and theirs are forgettable.  You'll get good service here and the place is fancier if that's what you are looking for, but there are dozens of local establishments in the valley that'll serve you more authentic food.  Albeit, they just might be a little more ghettoish but still can make a heck of a taco."}
{"text":"If you're looking for Authentic Mexican, this is not your place. But if you're looking for great Mexican-inspired food, this is you're place. Although, a chain, I would consider Abuelos one step up from On The Border, Chevy's, Macayo's or any other Tex Mex chain. The atmosphere and interior alone are more sophisicated. The salsa chips are very addicting. The salsa has a smooth smoky flavor. Also, the enchaladas and steak combo makes a great meal. I always ask for no seasoning or light seasoning on the steak because it's a little spicy. The enchaladas are flawless. And you must try the Papas con Chile! These are mash potatoes kicked up with cheese and peppers."}
{"text":"Always a family favorite.  Although it is a 'chain', the food is always great.  I tried something new tonight [Pork Tenderloin] and was very happy I did!  It was fantastic.  The staff is always great and we have neve had anythign but a great dining experience there."}
{"text":"This place is very good.  I am a native of AZ and know good Mexican.  Great atmosphere, great food, and not too pricey.  Last time there I tried the El Monterrey.  AWESOME!  Tons of food.  4 enchiladas, a chile relleno, a taco, and rice and beans.  If you want a real treat try the dulce de leche cheesecake.  They have down-sized it a bit since they opened, but it is mondo tasty."}
{"text":"I guess I should've prepared my stomach knowing that the food would probably be \"no bueno\" (the food is just as bad as my espaniol haha). I came here for a friend's birthday dinner, so there was a fairly big group of us. The environment was great for a large group, and even though it may be a little tacky I loved the \"indoor outdoor\" feeling with all the lighting etc. Our waitress was friendly, but service was ridiculously slow. Now I understand with big parties, we must be more patient, multiple ohmmmm chantings will be repeated before any sight of food.  When it takes over an hour after ordering to get the wronggg food delivered to us however, no amount of meditative chantings will calm the ferocious, growling tummy. She's a hard one to be tamed! When we finally did get the food we ordered, we were underwhelmed. The beans were so salty and dry I couldn't take more than three bites. How hard is it to cook beans? You take them out of a can and warm it over the stove....that's the extent of \"cooking\" beans. I ordered the shrimp tacos, which were supposedly spicy. Maybe my tolerance for spicy foods is higher than most of their customers' because I didn't feel any kick as I was eating. The sauce drowned the shrimp, in the tacos so there was no seafood flavor at all. I didn't bother trying any of the dishes my friends ordered, especially since they didn't seem too happy with their food either."}
{"text":"I would guess it has been between 10 and 12 years since we have dined at Abuelo's. It was relatively close to an event we were attending and we decided to give it another try.

This restaurant used to be fantastic when it first opened. Not so much anymore. Back in the day they had a medallions of filet mignon in a chipotle cream sauce that would knock your socks off it was so good. That item has been gone from the menu for years (which was largely why we stopped going) and the place has only gone downhill from there.

I ordered a chicken angel hair dish with veggies in a cream sauce and it was bland and awful. The sauce tasted like it was from a can or bottle: terrible. The chicken was bland, flaccid and worthless. The veggies, although fresh and crisp added nothing to the dish.

My husband, who ordered a chimichanga, was also unimpressed with his meal and said, \"there is no reason to ever come back here.\"

All that said, the service was good and the chips were light crispy and warm and the salsas were good, but that was not enough to salvage the meal or create any expectation that we will ever return or tell anyone to go there."}
{"text":"This place is always busy but I don't get it.   Went here last night for dinner with my parents after not having been here for over a year.   The portions DEFINITELY are smaller.  The food, in my opinion, is very inconsistent.    Sometimes ok, other times awful.   However, the only thing you can count on here is over salted food, warm salsa and chewy beef.   Poor quality con queso, tastes like out of a jar.  A manager came by our table and we asked if they reduced their portion sizes.   He said the  portion sizes have not changed just the size of the tortillas.  You figure that one out."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, this restaurant has gone downhill quick. Super salty meat, tasteless sauces, canned shredded chicken. Sodium, sodium! Won't be back!"}
{"text":"The best hands down authentic style original tex-mex plated food on the west side.  In on a Thursday great appetizer great drinks great food.  John our waiter was outstanding.  Thanks for the service and this will continue to be a regular dining event"}
{"text":"Yes we came here for my mother's 76th birthday our first time here. And right from the start Grace who took our call and sat us down was amazing she gave us a table right in the middle of the what appear to be an atrium. But it wasn't, it was beautiful though. Jose came and gave us an amazing, amazing serving experience. We had some ideas of what we wanted to eat and he redirected us to something else that was more amazing and he was not kidding! We are avid fans  and avid chefs, we cook a lot of Mexican food at home from scratch and we are serious about cooking! So just so you know Jose was amazing he was very amazing! On the other end Luis Sanchez the chef of Abuelo's all the restaurants in town prime time! Yep like he is prime time the food was impeccable, the rice that we had was amazing, the beans we had was amazing, the ribeyes we had was amazing, the shrimp we had OMG!!! The flan that we had was amazing! This place rocks , we will drive 6.8 miles easily to come and eat here all day long!   In the end the price was a lot less than it should've been! In the end Jose rocked wherever he goes whether it's here or elsewhere he rocked! Great amazing quiet polite charming amazing! The cocktails were primetime amazing perfection the food? Perfection we will not eat out for Mexican except here and we are of Latino Hispanic dissent. Very critical about where we eat because we are truly always disappointed. So we are serious shifts in our house yes homemade her tears homemade tamales homemade everything! This place is Barnone! If you come here and are not happy then clearly you have not eaten authentic Mexican food! Enough said!"}
{"text":"Came to AZ from San Diego for the weekend to celebrate my father's birthday and he wanted Aubuelos for dinner.  I have four words....PLATES ARE TOO HOT!  I like my food to be hot out of the kitchen but this was overkill.  The flavor was underwhelming also (maybe because I burned my taste buds off after the first bite)

On a good note....our waiter was awesome and the Margarita was really good.   Dad loved it so that's all that matters right?"}
{"text":"This place is nice. I call it the cheese cake factory of Mexican food.
Of course everything in that neighborhood better be nice for the amount of rent they pay."}
{"text":"Such a wonderful place to eat!!!  Besides the decor being so fantastic,,,the food is great!!!!!  We have been twice now and both times, got the yummy dip-trio with has queso, quac with an avocado cream, and a sausage queso dip with fresh hot chips.  First time I tried the tortilla soup which was authentic and really tasty.  The next time, I tried my test for all Mexican restaurants,,,,chile rellenos.  The rellenos are some of the best I have ever tried and you can fill them with cheese or tender shredded beef.  The beef is outstanding and I did one of each but next time will probably do all beef it is so good.  Both times we have also had very friendly service. Definitely going to go back because I have to try their margarita ((another of my tests for Mexican restaurants))-I will let u know how good they are) and they have a tres leches cake that I am dying to try also!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Our third time dining at Abuelo's.  The burritos grande were delicious as always except we were surprised to find ground beef instead of the traditional shredded beef  which adds more texture and flavor. The tortilla soup was lacking: served in a  mini container with lid not the bowl I expected; invisible chicken;  nondescript veggies with a nondescript  flavor and  came with 3-4 teeny weeny tortilla strips; likely the worst I have had anywhere. 

You may want to skip the well advertised  \"Watermelon Margarita\"  which is not a real margarita but a lot of water with a bit of flavorless watermelon puree and little to no lime or alcohol.  I could smell something perfumy and wondered if it were an artificial substitute for tequila? A sure money maker for the restaurant at $10. 

Our chocolate lave desert w/ ice cream was delicious. 

We will likely return but make sure to order a real margarita and stick to what we know."}
{"text":"Placed a review for this place several months ago. Now it's not in my review list. Yelp??  Manager was horrific. Got pissed that we had an opinion about our food. Told us his name was Frank Russo and all of his staff told us his real name and that he was the assistant manager. When we told him he was being rude to us he said \"no your being rude\". Wow! This was a regular place for us but we've never returned. Calls to the actual manager was not returned."}
{"text":"Excellent service, food and atmosphere! Had just left another establishment due to terrible service.  Ended up at Abuelos.  So glad we did.  Everything was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Excellent! Food, timing, food temp, customer service! Our experience today was AWSOME! We come here quite often but today seemed best! Maybe because I was hungry! LOL! I had the sea bass yum! My plate was clean! Wait staff is on point! Loved it! Will definitely be back for more! Thanks!"}
{"text":"Yakety Yak! Don't come back!

This chain restaurant is relatively new and located near the new shopping sprawl of Harvard Park in Warrensville Heights. Situated right next door to the latest Olive Garden, that alone should set off a luminous evil chain vibe before you even set foot in the door. 

The building and ambiance were both very impressive, I'll give them that. It almost reminded me of a Mexican Cheesecake Factory. I wouldn't be the least bit surprised if they both shared the same architect. Inside there were giant, brightly colored murals canvasing the walls. I also remember a water fountain with a rather imposing statue made of stone overlooking the dinning room. The ceiling is tall and is painted to resemble a blue sky. It's also illuminated, as if to simulate sunlight. Don't be fooled with all the gimmickry though, this place is as fake as the clouds painted on the ceiling. (For instance, this place serves mashed potatoes! What type of Mexican restaurant serves mashed potatoes!?)

The group of six I was with started with margarita's. 15 minutes later, the drinks arrived. When they were empty, another 15 minutes to get refilled. By the time the third drink arrived I was sober and cranky. Right off the bat, nothing can spoil a dining experience more so than lousy service. Nothing that is except for a lousy appetizer.....

The appetizer list consisted of Nachos, Quesadillas and a few dipping sauces for the tortilla chips. How's that for originality?! I think Taco Bell's Value Menu is more extensive that Abuelo's app list!  We settled on the Chili Con Queso and the Guacamole. The Con Queso was basically cheese flavored water. No texture, no flavor. I would've been more satisfied with melted Velveeta than this disaster in a bowl. This was obviously quite a disappointment, but not completely useless as I drank the cheese water to quench my thirst while I was still waiting on my 3rd margarita. 

For my main course, I had an enchilada of some sort. Again, it was that forgettable as I barely remember. Bland, uninspiring and sloppy looking. It surely didn't depict the pictures on the menu. 

Oh and I more thing, there is a reason why the prices aren't listed on their website. When I got the bill, I almost regurgitated my cheese water! Traditionally, Mexican food is inexpensive. The ingredients are basic (especially at this place) and the prices are usually reasonable. Not at Abuelo's. The quality of food and service here certainly doesn't justify the premium prices either. 

This one is a real stinker. Stay away at all costs."}
{"text":"Great service, lots of tasty options spinach enchiladas were delicious also chips and salsa they give you are great, the green salsa is my favorite! Will be back to try more."}
{"text":"Tried Abuelo's last night with some friends. Ambience and decor are lovely.

Had Grandieza frozen margarita ($5!) that was solid and refreshing! It took me 1.5 hours to polish off due to its size and brain freeze side effect.

Huge fan of their green salsa! Sweet (like a hint of mango?) and mild.

Ordered the beef chimichanga - not the best...I guess I assumed it would be shredded beef when it was ground! It tasted elementary and cafeteria-like. But - the papas con chili?!? Soooo tasty!

A friend split the Fajitas-for-two with another friend. With their order, they received a plate of lettuce, onion, cheese. One politely asked if they could get a little more. The waiter acts like lettuce is rare and sacred and tells her \"Well, lemme see what I can do\". What??? Dude, make that happen - we're talking lettuce and tomato here!! Smh

No add'l fixings were provided. That's just not providing a positive customer experience, IMO.

I won't be back for a full meal, but wld entertain just having their papas and a margarita at the bar."}
{"text":"Tonight we had a five star experience at Abeulo's. From start to finish we had a great dinner. This may not be a five star restaurant for everyone but for me this hits the spot and tonight the service and food were both top notch.

Our waitress Amy was wonderful and very engaging. She made sure that we had everything that we needed and was wonderful throughout. One of the food runners, Ryan definitely deservers a call out for his outstanding customer service. I hope that the managers of Abuelo's check these reviews because Ryan is really a great guy and he deservers recognition. He always remembers my fiancé and I and he always makes good conversation. He makes sure that we have everything we need and it is people like Ryan who make us want to continue coming back to Abuelo's again and again.

Every once in awhile the service is not as good and every once in awhile there is a mix up with the food but it has always been corrected and I understand that sometimes these things happen. But most times Abuelo's is great and keeps us coming back for more. The chips and salsa are wonderful, the selection of multiple prices of appetizers is great (I recommend the green chili cheese crisp) and the enchiladas are also very tasty.

Overall assessment is that this location of Abuelo's keeps us coming back again and again and that is the true test of a great restaurant, chain or not."}
{"text":"Ok, I should have known that a restaurant whose full name is 'Abuelo's Mexican Food Embassy' wasn't a good place to come to eat after being in Los Angeles for ten years.   I got excited about an enchilada with shrimp and scallops.  I asked if I could get it without the guacamole and her response was \"Then what do you want in it?\"  

\"What do I want in it?\"  Granted I may have been exhausted from lack of sleep and a cramped flight, but I lost all interest in that dish.  My replacement option was ok, Chile Manzanillo with crab, shrimp and scallops, but there was too much cheese/sauce covering up the taste of the seafood.  

It does get a star for not being busy at 7PM.  Granted, I am used to having to wait with other LA diners when I eat out.  There was a lot of space.  

Also, the chips were very thin .... felt like they would break under the weight of the salsa."}
{"text":"I visited Abuelo's Mexican with a coworker for happy hour on a Friday. I had no previous knowledge of the restaurant and went solely based on my coworkers suggestion. I'm so glad she suggested Abuelo's Mexican because it was amazing. When we walked in we were greeted by a rather unpleasant hostess but that didn't rain on our happy hour parade. The restaurant is HUGE with ample seating and is decorated with typical Mexican restaurant decor. My coworker and I opted to seat on the bar side so that we could get the happy hour specials, which included both food and drinks. She order a quesadilla, I ordered nachos, and we both ordered margaritas. The nachos were so tasty and reminiscing over them makes me want to go back soon. The margarita was also tasty, but very very strong. I am by no means complaining, but rather giving you a heads up if you plan on drinking at the restaurant. Our bills were very inexpensive, which is a major plus. I can't wait to visit again."}
{"text":"Best enchiladas ever. The service is just great. Maybe too efficient. But I love the place. Really among the beat Mexican I've ever had."}
{"text":"Average Mexican food. The salsa trio that was served was bland. No real flavor with the chicken fajitas order. Atmosphere and service were very nice."}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday night with another couple. We were seated immediately. I was pleased with the ambience. Our drinks were brought to us in a timely manner. Our server was very helpful and friendly. I had the bacon wrapped and cheese/jalapeno stuffed shrimp. They were delicious. My sides included rice with cilantro and lime and a vegetable mix. The rice was excellent also but the vegetables were mushy. Way overcooked. That is my only complaint and I will definitely return."}
{"text":"We go very often to Abuelo's. We love the three different salsas that they give before the meal, All of them are delicious. The food is excellent no matter what dish we choose. Teresa has been our waitress a few times and is very friendly and has a wonderful personality and is always quick with service. We even brought our family visiting from out of town to Abuelo's. We highly recommend this restaurant to all of our friends."}
{"text":"Friday evening, place was dead. Service was friendly and quick. I had the beef and cheese chimichanga- very good. Others at the table had fajitas with huge shrimp; some dish with sea bass; a combo with a tamale and taco and enchilada something. Everyone liked their dish. Definitely will go back."}
{"text":"Decent food, pretty good service, my only real complaint is my dislike of the new ziosk systems on all the tables (otherwise I would have given 4 stars)."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for Mexican. I have never had a bad experience at Abuelos! I order take out for my staff meetings monthly and had them cater my mom's 60th birthday  I go there so often the staff always remembers me and the bartender even makes me my favorite margarita even though it's been off the menu for awhile. I love how I can make my own combination of enchilada's!"}
{"text":"On the expensive side, but still not too bad. Service was fantastic, even with the long wait to get seated. Food was good, but the meat was lacking for how much we paid. Overall worth it for a nicer night out."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Delicious Mexi food!! Also you get such a large portion for such a good price."}
{"text":"This restaurant has good, solid mexican food with enough variety that everyone can find something they like. It may not be the most authentic place in the world, but it gives you great ambiance and a good \"nearly fine dining\" experience. I've been here a couple of times and gotten good service and tasty food every time."}
{"text":"Our favorite restaurant by far.  There isn't anything we dislike. Our favorites are their enchiladas (try the avocado for something yummy and different), their soups and desserts are to die for. If you want something different than the usual Mexican fare, try their Chicken Zucchini or their Tilapia Vera Cruz, not to mention that they have the best soups in town."}
{"text":"Come on yelpers, stop rating down a place just because it is a chain. The dishes were delicious, salsas were particularly good. And you get 3 different complimentary salsas, compared to a regular of one. The enchiladas were also excellent.

Ambiance is gorgeous, classic mexican decor and a beautiful building. To top it off, prices are extremely competitive. You can get a very filling lunch for under $10."}
{"text":"So the only reason we went here was for the happy hour and it was a disappointing time. It started from when we first walked in and seen all the workers just standing around and talking to each other. We walked to the bar knowing they seen us but surely enough we waited there for awhile just to get service. After 5 to 10 mins we got service from somebody walking out the back. We ordered drinks which was ok and some queso dip that I truly didn't enjoy, to me it tasted like corn soup. We didn't order anything else, we was just ready to go."}
{"text":"Server was virtually rude! And the manager wasn't much better. But the waiter shared his story first so she'd decided her course of action. The waiter was back and fourth and never offered any appetizers, even the manager when I brought it to her attention still never was asked if we'd like an appetizer. Not my go to place and each visit re enforces why I don't like coming here. Their prices are high, portions are large, but I don't need the size of they're portions. New waitress and we'll see about the outcome. But she's trying; just will not change the out come of this visit."}
{"text":"Love love love this place!! They always have friendly quick service and their food is AMAZING! ! My husband always gets the Grande meal it is delicious and I love me a sangria swrill! Yummmm!"}
{"text":"Just as our Chinese restaurants we have a circle of Mexican restaurants we rotate through - Bibiano's, Pedro's, Las Glorias, Don Lencho's, Don Ruben's, Top Shelf, Anaya's, Mi Patio, Rita's and more.

This is one of our favorites.

It isn't just the chips and salsa everyone raves about although we always OD on them before our entrees come.

The charro beans have ample bacon and are quite good, better than the refried beans, as are the tacos.

People 60 and over can order from the lunch menu which is why some reviewers comment about an abundance of us old geezers.

It can be pricey, but with any restaurant you have to experiment and know what to order.

Two enchiladas with beans and potatoes or rice are $10.99. Worth trying."}
{"text":"We gave this place a try, as it is right next to Quaker Steak, which I happen to like because they are constantly changing their menu to stay with the competition. I gave Abuelo's a fair shake, but they did not measure up. Chips and salsa were good, but they should be embarrassed by the fajitas.  Little meat and the shrimp tasted like it was drenched in barbecue sauce, which was completely unnecessary.  Good service but it did not make up for the food."}
{"text":"I've been eating Mexican food for 50 years, mostly on the west coast.  Last night, I was in Phoenix and my colleague, who lives there, suggested eating at Abuelo's.

The building is elegant, with very nice decorations and wall murals.  Good enough to take a date.

I ordered the marinated steak Fajitas while my colleague and his wife ordered different items.  Service was excellent and so we're all three dishes.  My marinated steak was (and I don't exaggerate) the best I've ever had.  Really!

We all agreed on a 5 star rating for this place.  This review is for the Peoria location, the only one I've tried."}
{"text":"I was quite surprised when I walked into the restaurant...it's huge! Love the ambiance and the clouds painted on the ceiling. Got seated pretty quickly on a Friday night. Loved our server. He was very nice and got our drinks and food fast. I had a Raspberry Mojito and LOVED it...for some odd reason, a lot of bartenders don't know how to make a good mojito aka Lucille's BBQ but Abuelos does. The food was decent but I heard Arizona has subpar mexican food. And that's what this was. Pretty pricey and kind of an upscale feeling too so we probably won't be back. Located in the Arrowhead Entertainment Center and there is plenty of other restaurants in the area to try. 
**NOTE: Getting into the parking lot sucks!! No lights so you just have to pretty much cut people off getting into it. Good luck!!"}
{"text":"Always on point with the fajitas!!!! Tortillas are always fresh and soft. All around good food."}
{"text":"If I could give 10 stars I would. The firecracker shrimp tacos were amazing! And they serve delicious skinny margaritas. Great service too. It's amore!"}
{"text":"First time today for lunch. I had vegetarian (spinach and avocado, one each) enchiladas, and the other half had the chicken tacos. Very good food, and exceptionally nice waitstaff. The decor is beautiful, and the place is exceptionally clean. 
Only criticism is that the music, while wonderful, was a bit loud, hence the four stars rather than five. However, we will be back for sure.  The food is too good to pass up!"}
{"text":"Years ago my husband and I would go to reverse happy hour here and they had decent food and great sangria swirls. We recently visited for dinner and then another time for happy hour and I will probably not be coming back cause of the lack of quality the food is.

They have a trio dip that is really yummy but over the years they have been doing stuff different like out lettuce I. The bottom of the guacamole dip so you only get like 5 bites now. They Sangria swirl was my favorite! It had sangria swirled together with frozen margarita. Sounds yummy right? Well, the other day when we went for happy hour I got a sangria swirl and the color was different, the margarita was white and the texture was foamy.... it was not good and not natural that's for sure. 

Sadly, I'm done coming here and getting disappointed with the horrible changes every time we come in."}
{"text":"This place used to be pretty decent but the last few times have just been miserable.
They seem to have a new guy running the house and we keep running into him. Bald guy with extremely bad table management. When you tell me a table will be ready in 5 minutes and I'm still waiting after 30, you either can't tell time or you simply lie to customers. 
It's also kind of skeezy to be wiping menu crust on the floor in the lobby."}
{"text":"The whole expierience was not what I expected it to be. Clear case of not judging a book by it's cover. Sometimes when you start things off on a bad note, things only go downhill from there. The place looks great when you walk in, very nice decor happy people galore. We had a party of two and were told it was going to be 15 minutes which was fine seeing it was new years eve and everywhere was packed. It was more like 20, which is fine unless parties of 4 or more that came in 10 minutes after you are being sat first. When we said something 30 seconds later we were brought to our table. I would have rather sat at the bar seeing it was a small table in a awkward place. Still looked pretty decent, minus what looked like a leaky roof with missing tiles and stains. The chips were good, the salsa was trying to hard with the whole roasted  chipotle thing and was not that good. But we were hungry and finished pretty much the whole small bowl before we were even offered drinks (10-15 min). Strike 2! So My wife ordered a Draft american beer. It tasted horible, something was wrong with the tap. We told the waiter and instantly he said, \"it tastes like copper right?\" How are you guys going to know something is wrong and do nothing about it. He suggested that we stuck with mexican beer because there is no problem with that tap, My wife ordered a bottled beer. We ordered our food right away, I had the sonoran which was a shredded beef burro, cheese enchilada, and beef tamale, and my wife had stuffed chicken. My burro was covered in 50 cent nacho cheese, and filled with meat that was unseasoned and bland. My wifes dish was decent, could have been better, was a little to stong tasting on the seasoning. We asked for the check immediatly, and could tell by the three tables around us, that we were not alone in this bad expierience. They push this place off like it's authentic, it's really just crappy tex mex food. Go to Macayos, or even Garcias for better food, prices, and expierience."}
{"text":"Abuelo's used to have a dish called Camerones Costa Brava- it was to die for! But sadly they took it off the menu. Too bad- I have been back one time after it was taken off- and I asked to have it made special for me and they did! But I have not been back since that time. I wish they would bring it back."}
{"text":"Abuelo's has always been kind of a mixed bag.  

I really like the variety of salsas they provide with their chips, most notably, the green pineapple. If they don't give it to you with your order of chips, I'm pretty sure you can still request it.

I'm a huge fan of their signature papas con chile and consider it an essential side for whatever you order. It's a great deviation from the usual rice and beans you get at pretty much every sit-down Mexican restaurant in existence.  

As for the entrees themselves, I've had their chimichanga and found it to be acceptable. I've also had their Del Rio, which is a combination platter that has an enchilada, taco, and tamale. For some reason, none of them really seemed to pop in flavor. I requested a side of chili con queso, which I was told would cost extra. It ended up being almost four dollars extra. Seriously? It wasn't worth it, as I've had better elsewhere.

For dessert, the only thing we've ever had is their tres leches, which isn't the best I've ever had, but is decent enough by the standards of a chain.

They emphasize that all of their food is made from scratch and is completely fresh. Some stuff? Probably. But virtually everything? Eh. They're probably cutting some corners back there somewhere - as the food really tastes no better than all of the other \"Americanized\" Mexican chains in Phoenix.

I'm not a big fan of the tablets at the table. I don't even want to imagine the amount of germs built-up on these things. I'm sure it makes things easier on the servers, as well as customers that don't want to wait around to pay their bill, but there's just something about the concept that declassifies the restaurant (a la Olive Garden), despite having very beautiful décor.

There's a few other things I want to try on their menu (namely their fajitas), so I'm sure we'll swing by here every once in awhile. Personally, I'd be content if they served me a giant bowl of papas con chile and nothing else.  

Go in with realistic expectations and you'll be fine."}
{"text":"Was recommended by a friend...salsa was good and you get 3 choices.  Chips were chips...nothing special.   The ribeye steak and enchiladas was absolutely amazing.  For a closing, do yourself a favor and get the cheesecake.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch with the kids. Everything was delicious but found the total higher than I was hoping for. I mean I've had great mexican food for quite a bit less! I guess this is a nice place for a special dinner, thus the higher price tag. 

Service was great - the server was helpful. 

The trio of salsa and chips was fresh and yummy!

I got the chicken fajitas and mmmm - good stuff!"}
{"text":"I love the ALAMBRE DE CAMARON dish, it is awesome and the papas con chiles.  I just went today for my birthday lunch and the service was great."}
{"text":"We love this place, we go there a lot. I'm not really big into chains but I've always had good service and great food. My boyfriend and his dad both always want to go here on their birthdays. I definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Our Midwest quest for queso led us here while staying in Madison. The queso was okay, but it isn't really fair to compare to our Texas memories either. Not bad for Tex-Mex at all. The salsa was good and getting a variety is helpful since my wife sweats on sight of it even looks hot. Tabitha rocked keeping the drinks full and checking on us. The hostess made me feel a little like a 5th grader the teacher I was the student she was either angry with or disappointed in. I wasn't even the one who told her we needed the seating for three. everyone has bad days I guess. We will come again."}
{"text":"Mediocre food with low quality ingredients."}
{"text":"Come here when you're super hungry and wearing some comfortable clothes that have an expandable waist because it's really big portions!! My family and I come here not a lot, but at least 9 or 10 times within the past 7 or 8 months and it's always on a Sunday. The food is always consistently really good, the hostesses are always smiling and polite, the decor is pretty serene and not so loud considering how crowded it usually is, and service is usually very good, esp. on holidays that's not overwhelmingly crowded (like today, Easter). Today, our server was exceptionally nice. My mom is picky, because she and my brother have some health challenges so they cannot eat a lot of stuff, my mom asked for modifications in their dishes and our server was really easy going and accommodating. She brought us extra chips and specific kinds of salsa while we waited, without us having to ask! She was always attentive and brought us water and came by to check on us without having to be flagged down. I work in the service industry, and although I'm really easy going, when I'm with my mom and brother, it's always up to them and loved the pasta!!"}
{"text":"Waitress wise:nice, attentive, good. Food wise: 2 people from a group of 6, liked their meal. Chips greasy and thin. salsa thin and watery. Reynosa
salad appeared w/lettuce and seasoned ground beef. That's it??? Had to say: \"where is the rest of my salad? Missing 5 ingredients... Brought out the rest of it... but, come on... it sucked. Enchiladas (steak) were good,
cheese con queso is the best thing on the menu...Drink wise: Get the seasonal Samuel Adams, not a great beer selection..Nice clean restaurant..just needs to get better food.."}
{"text":"Some of the best gourmet Mexican food in Chandler. While their chips and salsa are often middle of the road, their Shrimp wrapped in bacon is just exceptional. They offer plenty of substitutions if you don't like a particular item and their drinks are always spot on. The Grande is large enough for two people, while the Durango burrito is a sinfully delicious."}
{"text":"Tilapia Veracruz is one of their best items on the menu. But I feel it is overpriced. Good to go in groups."}
{"text":"Ok, it's a chain, and it shows, but our 14-year-old boy LOVED the chimichanga fajitas. Any place where he's willing to venture beyond his \"usual\" fare is a place that I appreciate."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in 4 years, never a big fan of the food. We went yesterday for lunch & it was awesome! Got seated immediately, the service was great & the food was delicious. Found out they have revamped the menu (now serve pork!!!) & a new chef has put together some good dishes. Great atmosphere, beautiful restaurant & great food at a fair price. Highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"So this place is ok. Below average Mexican food. The tortillas were not home made. Lots of fat and cheese to cover up the poor quality of the food. Guacamole was missing cilantro, salt and onions. Margarita was ok. Bathroom was nasty and no toilet paper, the hostess was sitting on her phone instead of tending to it. Definitely not coming back. Chipotle would've been a better and cheaper option!"}
{"text":"Don't bother--bland food along with casually disinterested service makes this not worth your time."}
{"text":"My wife were impressed as soon as we walked in. The restuarant is very nicely decorated giving it that authentic Mexican charm. We were greeted with a smile and quickly seated. We ordered margaritas to go with my chicken enchiladas and her pescado guerrero. The food arrived in a timely matter and the taste was excellent. The service was just as good making it a wonder dining experience. We'll be back."}
{"text":"There happy hour is pretty good. The tacos are cheap and they have some other rather affordable options. Sorry to say I don't remember the exact prices. Beers are also affordable and the happy hour food options are both satisfying and filling.

The happy hour prices are only available in the bar and the seating is somewhat limited, so unless you're willing to wait for those seats or get there right when happy hour starts you might not want to try it.

Service is prompt and helpful and I have been pretty satisfied every time we've been."}
{"text":"My new favorite Mexican restaurant. Everything was delicious. The hosts and wait staff were very very busy but fast and courteous. Loved loved loved the place."}
{"text":"Their fajitas are damn good and their watermelon margaritas are bomb!  I'll be coming back here again soon."}
{"text":"The server was the best! Israel was so friendly, courteous, apologetic AND proactive about the longer than usual wait times, and he refilled our drinks before we were even finished with them. Seriously, he made the experience worth the drive and the wait. The food on the other hand, was a batch of sodium injected frozen and then microwaved crap that tasted awful and made both my husband and I feel ill. I wouldn't recommend it. We got fajitas and they were far from fresh."}
{"text":"Worst Mexican in the valley. It really is. ESPECIALLY for a joint that has such awesome location, building and name. SHAME! Stay away. There is not much else i can add except - I'd like my money back, please."}
{"text":"Great service, was greeted at the door. And seated right away.   With in  minutes   our order was being taken and chips and salsa were on the table.  I had the  steak fajita chimichanja.  It was very tasty,   I  stop in here a few times a year and food and service are always excellent."}
{"text":"Yes, I'm a fan of Abuelo's- excellent food, great atmosphere, good prices. The chips served after you are seated are accompanied by 3 salsas (green chili citrus, hot verde and \"regular\") and all three are really tasty. They're unlimited but be careful, don't spoil your meal. 

If you like beef then try the Durango burrito. My wife always goes for the enchilada trio (chicken, avacado). You get to select from sides like rice, papas (mashed cheese potatoes with chilis), and various beans. The margarita list is solid, and the house ritas are really pretty good. There's a great lunch menu if you're visiting midday. 

The staff has mostly been friendly and attentive every time we've visited- the place is good for kids as they have  nice menu for the little ones. The \"main room\" has a skyscape painted on the ceiling, so our toddler enjoyed that room. For the quality of food, I think the price is right- although expect to pay a little more than Macayos or Serranos. It's worth it, go visit!"}
{"text":"Solid! We order this to go almost every week.  Spike at the bar is awesome!

So good!"}
{"text":"I reserved the private room for my wife's birthday. We had 29 people in our group and the servers did a great job servicing us. The chips & salsa varieties were excellent. Everybody loved their entrees. I ordered the carnitas tacos and liked them very much. The manager came in to greet us and make sure all was well. Again, excellent customer service! We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Be aware, when they run promotions they are not keyed in, you have to inform your server you know about them.  We were overcharged and the manager supposedly corrected it.  On our way out we noticed he didn't.  Useless.  First off, what happened to their food.  What a slide over the last year.  Prices skyrocketed and food quality has become non existent.  First off food was very hot...which I like.  Waitress in the adjoining bar area was very attentive.  However, everything on the plate was just mushed and run together, no separate flavors. We both had the grande.  Chips not salted, mini chicken tapas needs chicken I would assume and the quesadilla was just thrown on the plate and when you add chicken you would hope they would as well.  When you pay"}
{"text":"I am always looking for new Mexican restaurants to try. After reading the reviews I wanted to stop by.
I arrived right at opening at 11 o'clock and was seated promptly by a hostess. The inside of the restaurant is beautiful with very high ceilings and great decor. With the giant cloud mural on the ceiling it almost feels like you're sitting outside. 
I sat and watched other people being seated after me and being tended to immediately by a server and getting drinks and chips. I was sort of in a corner and they seemed to have forgotten about me. There were a few employees standing by the bar talking. At 11:15 someone saw me, came over and apologized for the long wait saying they had a no show and offered to take my order. I ordered an iced tea as well as a chili relleno and cheese enchilada plate.
My iced tea came at 11:23 as well as chips and salsa. Now here is where it gets good. The chips were absolutely amazing. They are super thin and fresh which is rare and I absolutely love. They give you three different types of salsa which is another bonus.
My food finally arrived at 11:35.The food looks delicious and was plated very elegantly. The chili relleno was a little small but good and the cheese enchilada was excellent. The rice was good as well.
They have a kiosk on the table which allows you to pay for your meal quickly without waiting for a check. This was very helpful to save time as I had been there for almost an hour.
The menu at this restaurant looks amazing and I will definitely have to try it again. This place seems like a very nice restaurant, unfortunately for my visit, the fact that the service was so slow cost them that coveted fifth star."}
{"text":"came here with couple coworkers.  the food was pretty good.  had the rib eye with 2 enchilladas combo plate... tons of food but then I was quite hungry and polished them off pretty quick.  coworkers had the sizzling plate with grilled meats and vegies, they liked it.  atmosphere was nice.  a decent place to bring a date.  we didn't order any specialty alcoholic drinks but judging from other tables, the patrons seemed to enjoy their drinks.

I recommend it if you're dying for decent mexican/american food.

\"piece\" out!"}
{"text":"Decided to come here after stumbling upon their loyalty program online.  You sign up and they get you in with a free entree coupon.  This is a smart tactic in a city with a plethora of restaurants to choose from!
We immediately were pleased with the chips and salsa as well as the fact it was still happy hour and we were seated on their lovely 'indoor' patio.  So we ordered a round of margaritas to start.  They were very good and happy hour prices are great.
The food was really quite delicious, different and better than I was expecting.  We ordered a variety of enchiladas.  And do I mean variety!  They have so many different ones to choose from, along with a menu of enchilada sauces.  My favorite was the spinach with the cream sauce.  But I fully intend to come back and try some of the others.  
Service was great too!  Some menu items are pricey so we stuck to the Tex-mex items."}
{"text":"I love the salsas that come with the chips here. We are fairly consistent with our veggie orders - veggie fajita, combo enchilada (spinach and avocado) and cheese quesadilla for our little one :) not disappointed so far .."}
{"text":"I agree that Abuelo's is about a notch below On the Border, which isn't saying much for the restaurant.  This place is good for groups.  I have to say that there is one thing on the menu that actually is good and cheap...the flatiron steak is actually tasty.....just a note:  this isn't a Mortons or Gibson's bone in ribeye...this is a flatiron steak...that's it.  The rest of the food is okay. Don't go if you're expecting good mexican.  Spend a night out in the Frontera with a local to get REAL Mexican food...thanks Miguel for that near death experience."}
{"text":"Prologue:
My fiancée and I decided to celebrate Mexican Independence Day with our first visit to our nearby Abuelo's.


The Plot:
We started by sharing the Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms and Seared Tuna appetizers.

That was followed by The Monterey, which consisted of a Sour Cream Chicken Enchilada, Avocado Enchilada, Spinach Enchilada, Chicken Ranchera Enchilada, Cheese Chile Relleno, and a Crispy Chicken Taco.
We also ordered one of their September specials called The Hidalgo, which consisted of a Fajita Frite Relleno and Fajita Enchilada with Cilantro Lime Rice and Black Beans substituted for Mexican Rice and Refried Beans, respectively.

We concluded our meal by happily sharing a Chocolate Eruption.


The Scene:
We arrived at approximately 6pm on a busy and popular Saturday yet were seated within 15 minutes, which, in our experience, was quicker than average for a large franchise.

The chips with assorted salsa along with our beverages arrived soon thereafter.

The appetizers were the next pleasant surprise and both were enough for the two of us to share.
I was quite satisfied with the Seared Tuna despite it being somewhat more pricy compared to the other appetizers on the menu. We're both devoted fans of sushi and sashimi and the quality of the tuna, both in flavor and texture, was obviously better than we've experienced at most Asian restaurants. The mango relish, avocado, spicy mustard, and honey lime dressing complimented the fish very nicely.
The Stuffed Mushrooms were topped with a cheese sauce that was light and had a nice tomato flavor that went well with the spinach.

The Monterey was a generous quantity of food for the price and would have been enough for the both of us on its own. This was my first time trying a Spinach Enchilada and Avocado Enchilada and both were very good. I am also a Chile Relleno fan and I truly enjoyed the fresh, veggie flavor of the one that was served with assortment.

My fiancée thoroughly enjoyed her Relleno as well, which on the Hidalgo plate was stuffed with beef, and the Fajita Enchilada was stuffed with chicken. Both were flavorful, well seasoned, and she commented favorably on the delicate texture of the corn tortilla.
She was also very satisfied with the Cilantro Lime Rice and Black Beans, which nicely dressed up this plate more than the Mexican Rice and Refried Beans probably would have.

The Chocolate Eruption was a slight variation on the familiar molten chocolate cake or chocolate lava cake with which we've all been tempted before. We both liked this version very much because the hot chocolate sauce was poured on top rather than baked inside so the whole the cake was soft and moist. There was also enough ice cream and whipped cream for both of us to share. As restaurant franchises go, this was perhaps the best dessert experience we've had thus far this year.


The Rest of the Story:
The service was prompt and courteous and the prices very reasonable for this type of dining.

This was our first experience using Ziosk and I hope many more of our favorite restaurants will begin to implement this system. Be sure to tap the \"Call Server\" button when you're ready to order.


Epilogue:
We felt the quality of the food and the overall dining experienced deserved 3 stars and decided to upgrade our rating to 4 stars based on the good service, reasonable prices, and the chocolate dessert.

No doubt we will return the next time we're in the mood for Mexican.

{"text":"Mmmm...chips and THREE different salsas. Both of us had amazing meals (seafood and fajitas) which had to go home with us because we ate so much delicious chips pre-meal...oops. I'm not even mad about it. Lunch the next day!"}
{"text":"Abuelos, kinda sorry it took me so long to finally write up this review.  We had hear about Abuelos since we first moved to Chandler 2 years ago. In that time we have visited several times and each time has surpassed our expectations. Start with food as usual, we have tried several dishes and appetizers. Our favorites are the carnitas enchiladas and the firecracker shrimp tacos.  The servings are plentiful, the ingredients fresh and the flavors delicious. Overall the food is very good.  Next in importance to us is service. We have been there at the busiest times, Like Friday nights and during slower times like weekday afternoons.  Every time the service has been excellent very little wait and lots of attention.  The restaurant itself is spacious, open and very nicely decorated.  All in all, we have always enjoyed our visits to Abuelos and will continue to go there.  We must also say that none of this was a surprise to us once we learned who the proprietor was.  We both knew Chris when he was very young and starting in the food business. The food business has always been Chris, passion and that continues to be evident in his establishments."}
{"text":"What a great experience for our 1st visit to Peoria.  The food was delicious, the ambiance was beautiful and best of all we had a great server.  Ask for DAVID for a superior experience and do try the sea bass in cream sauce.  Loved it."}
{"text":"Usually a favorite of mine. This time it went from bad to worse. Ordered the fajitas. Came out semi warm and the tortillas were COLD. asked for some warm ones and they took so long the meat was cold. My girlfriends plate was the wrong meal and then they had the check completely wrong.  Probably will not be coming back.  So long and adios."}
{"text":"I went here a couple of weeks ago with two friends. It was a Thursday night and not busy at all. We sat in the bar area and I really enjoyed the atmosphere - very open, big, and TVs on but not playing loudly. Our waiter was super friendly. My friend ordered enchiladas with all the sauce on the side, which is an unusual request, but he was very accommodating and had it done no problem. I had a mojito which was really good, and three different kinds of enchiladas, all of which were amazing. Overall a great experience and I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"I lived in Chandler my entire life, until three years ago. And now whenever I come back to visit family, I make sure to stop at Abuelo's. That has to be saying something considering that I can go to ANY Mexican restaurant in Phoenix, and I choose this one.

The service is always spot on, the food is always good, and I cannot get enough of their Margaritas. My mom loves their Shrimp cocktail, and I do not disagree. If you want to try something delicious, and unique, I highly recommend ordering it to start. The warm chips/pita things are amazing!"}
{"text":"Wow, is it me or are the front people who first greet customers just making bad names for their employees. Girl at abuelo's when first walk in was the rudest individual..... We didn't want to sit at bar and she took major attitude...... Hope the food is better and the rest of the staff is better!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I feel terrible I cannot remember our waiters name! We were a group of 11 adults and 3 kids and our waiter was so awesome! I wanna say his name was Jadon but I'm not sure. The date was Saturday July 11 at 6 pm. I really wanted to give him RAVE reviews!
The place has a great atmosphere. Good was good too! We had a reservation and the high chairs for the kids were all set up in perfect locations. 
Everyone's meal arrived at the same time, and all correct! Thanks kitchen staff!
We are from CA so I can't say we'll be back soon, but I would return!
This place has everything from typical Mexican to specially prepared dishes that were so good!!"}
{"text":"I come here every time I'm in the area, usually for lunch. I adore their Durango burrito, a shredded beef burrito covered in cheese.  Chili con queso dip is fabulous. I sometimes take a bowl home for later. My husband got the burrito grand. He seemed to like the chips and salsa more. Our bill totaled about  22$. Waitress was nice and prompt."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night. We waited about 20 minutes. Seated promptly and served great tortilla chips with equally good salsa. Didn't get our place settings until after our food came out, but the server was wet courteous."}
{"text":"Wow, can't believe there are no reviews on this place yet....guess it doesn't make an impression.   Went here yesterday for lunch with some friends, we all finished our plates.  I feel like this is a REAL nice place for dinner as far as the atmosphere but nothing on the menu really gets me the need to eat here.  I ordered a spinach enchilada and avocado enchilada with beans and potatoes.  The spinach one was good but the avocado wasn't special, the beans were less than average but the potatoes were kinda of different but in a good way.  I wish I could find something here that I could crave because the service is always good and the atmosphere is just awesome.  Guess I will keep coming here till I find my combo."}
{"text":"This place is huge and nice....seemingly fancy but not at all. 

I had a beergarita to start, YUM! Nice and big. They also serve chips and salsa to start so that was cool too.

I had the chicken and enchilada plate with rice and the cheesey potatoes. This food is pretty Americanized which is fine by me since I am not a huge fan of this fare normally. The enchilada was so so in my mind but the taco was really good. I had the ground beef taco. The rice was typical rice but good and the cheesey potatoes were amazing (how cnayou go wrong with cheese and potatoes creamed to a nice puree?!)

Boyfriend got a HUGE platter of tacos and enchiladas and rice and beans and potatoes. I MEAN HUGE! It all tasted good and he's a huge critic since this is his favorite kind of food. He admitted his was Americanized as well but you can't complain if something tastes good right?

His mom was with us and she got the tilapia dish. It looked really healthy and smelled really good. Fresh veggie mix as the side with some rice and shrimp on top of the fish.

Overall I think this place was good. We had a gift card here so that was our excuse for going there. I don't know if we would ever go again since we don't live in the area but I am not ruling it out."}
{"text":"Mexican chain that is average at best. 
Good atmosphere and long waits. 
Margarita's are eh. Something was missing. Oh that's right, the booze! 
Food is meh. 
I ordered the: Grande Burrito - Shredded chicken with sour cream sauce, Mexican rice, cheese and refried beans all wrapped in a flour tortilla. Chicken didn't taste very fresh and it was oversalted (normal I guess). 
Service was good. He was attentive. Prices were average. 
Would not return...food isn't worth it."}
{"text":"Five stars for what it is, a Mexican family restaurant. Food was delicious. Margaritas were great. Coloring for the kids. Reasonable prices and very friendly, attentive service. Would definitely come back if we're in the area."}
{"text":"My sons brought me here for Mother's Day.  It was busy, but we didn't have to wait as long as we thought.  We were seated in about 20 minutes and our waiter was prompt and courteous.  I ordered the agave margarita which was very bland.  I had a shredded beef enchilada and a chicken enchilada served with refried beans and papas con chile (yummy).  The shredded beef was very flavorful, but there wasn't much chicken in the chicken enchilada.  It was a prefect amount of food for me - not too much.  My boys and husband enjoyed their meals as well.

Atmosphere is pretty loud with all the customers.  Lots of kids being Mother's Day.  We will have to try it again on a non-holiday."}
{"text":"This is one of my favored Mexican chains, but sometimes can be hit or miss. On my most recent visit, I ordered the Sautéed Chicken Zucchini. It's a good sized portion and isn't heavy or greasy like some of the other Mexican dishes. I've only ever tried a few of the sides, but my favorites are the vegetables and charro beans. I am usually quite picky about margaritas, but Abuelo's skinny margarita is pretty darn good if you ask me! Would recommend this place if you are looking for something a little different than Macayo's, On the Border, etc."}
{"text":"This is not authentic Mexican food. So disappointed. I'll save my money and go to filibertos next time"}
{"text":"In the past I have always had great service here however the management has changed hands and they flat out told me when I brought a concern to there attention \"sorry we're a coporate chain\". Really? So that means no customer service? That's fine we won't be back!! Stick to the smaller mom and pop shops, they at least have great customer service and when they screw up they make it right!"}
{"text":"Not bad but not great. I prefer smaller local Tex Mex."}
{"text":"Went for dinner on a Wednesday and sat on the patio with a group of 9.  Everything we had was good.  Decent happy hour.  Nice selection of mostly traditional Tex Mex with some original items.  Would have liked to try some other things on the menu.  Very nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"I came back to try something different with my niece from out-of-state, I don't remember what the name of the dish is called, but it was a sautéed shredded pork that was OMG so delicious! And again I love the chips and the green salsa, talk about A fabulous salsa that I've not had at  another restaurant, I couldn't wait to have it again! And I had a raspberry daiquiri, even though it had no alcohol in it, it still was fantastic!  I can't wait to bring my parents from out-of-state here for dinner when they visit! So twice now I have not been disappointed at all, and the inside of the restaurant is nice."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE Abuelo's!!! We frequently go at least every other month, and usually get the steak fajitas or chili rellenos. This time they have romaine lettuce wraps for the fajitas, and it makes the meal a little lighter. Great job Abuelo's!! The steak was so juicy and tender, and the charro beans with spinach side was perfectly seasoned. The charro beans taste like they are made from clay pots. Our server Douglas was exceptional. Drinks always filled, fast friendly service. We always get great Service but he stood out to the point that I wanted to get his name to compliment him. He ensured we had everything we needed and was satisfied with every item he brought out. We are long time customers, and will continue to brag about the great food and service..."}
{"text":"First time here and the facility is actually very impressive inside and out. I also noted how incredibly clean everything was including the restroom. Service was just ok. Server brought out chips and 4 salsas. I would expect the server to take 8 seconds to explain what they were instead of having to guess. Wife had lunch chimi day it was ok. Kid quesadilla was cold. I ordered chorizo chicken. It was rather good but the portion size was stupid small. Like a half a breast. It felt like a typical corporate menu item downsized for cost. It was more an appetizer portion. Host staff was really unfriendly. When I got there I went to restroom to wash my hands and blonde host said nothing on way in and out. 2nd restroom visit Hispanic female looked up and gave me eye contact and said nothing as she went back to reading whatever she had at the podium. I always feel the host staff is super important as they are the restaurant ambassadors and the first and last impression. No Nothing is ever good enough for you with me Michael.need to be so unfriendly. 

Probably wont go back..to many other options around town with that food genre."}
{"text":"The red sangria was awesome. The rest of the meal was Mexican-esque and very, very salty. We won't be going back, as our legs will be so big and won't be able to carry us our of the house for a few days."}
{"text":"Delicious margaritas! And for a few dollars more it is possible to supersize them! My dinner was bacon-wrapped beef tenderloin medallions and shrimp. It was a treat for the taste buds.  The chile rellenos, two chile peppers stuffed with shredded beef and doused in cheese, were also good.  But, the true star at Abuelo's is the margarita.  Warning: one supersized margarita can make you feel very happy.  Two would be dangerous."}
{"text":"The service was good and the food is tasty. The fajitas were good, but my overall favorite are from Chevys Fresh Mex..... 

Our margarita pitcher was mostly ice, so keep that in mind when ordering. 

I recommend the chocolate cake for dessert- kind of like the one from Applebees or Chilis."}
{"text":"The food is really good here. I tried \"The Grande\" and it was pretty good. The dinner portion is huge. I also tried the agave margarita and it was very nice. 
Good service and ambiance makes this place one of the good mexican restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Chris our server was awesome! The food tasted great as usual and they give you large portions. Love the atmosphere here. We love Abuelos!!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place it has amazing salsa and chips while you wait and the staff is super nice. the food ugh where do I start is just too good to be true lol love it here :)"}
{"text":"I visited Abuelo's while visiting family members in Chandler. They stated this was one of their favorite tex-mex places. Upon arriving I was a little put off by the expansive building, columns and statue, but my group sat in the bar area, which was comfortable. 
Our server was excellent! Yummy chips and salsas were served right away. While looking over the menu, looking for vegan options, we thought we had options figured out, but asked and were mistaken. The server knew the ingredients of many of the vegetarian options and was able to let us know which had hidden animal fluids. She customized some items for us and everything was delicious. 
The happy hour specials were great! My party enjoyed many margaritas and two orders of guac. 
I would go back, because the family would want to. My only request is a few more vegan options, thanks!"}
{"text":"For a chain restaurant, this really wasn't too bad. I went in not expecting a lot and was pleasantly surprised with the food. The frozen margarita was really good and boozy and we had a nice meal. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Service was amazing they even opened the door as we left. Waitress was very knowledgeable and super nice!! The food left something to be desired though! I love Mexican food and this seamed to be more like a high end taco bell. Don't get me wrong it was ok food nothing wrong with it by any means it just didn't taste like authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat Mexican food.  The place is always super clean and a great place to eat with the family. I ordered the Chicken Chimis with the queso sauce. Comes with rice beans guac n sour creme. This is my favorite thing to eat here. I' ve had their enchiladas here before and they are not that good. The chimis have green peppers inside which is magnificent.  I also ordered the hot salsa which i poured over the chimis and bam.  Was awesome!! This sauce is made with habaneros which is great but very spicy. The service by Chip was great as usual. This is the the second time we have been served by Chip and he is definitely one of the best servers at Abuelos.   I only had one negative on our dining experience; my favorite thing about Abuelos was their cold beer in the ice frosted Margarita glasses, however today my beer was served in regular glasses. The beer was not cold, so I was disappointed.  I still left Chip a generous tip, and he told me they did not have these glasses,...what  a disappointment. Still give them 5 stars for meal n service but 4 stars for the beer failure. Overall 4.5 stars for this place."}
{"text":"I LOVE the look of Abuelos and the fun ceiling just brings everything together. 

Abuelos was one of my first jobs when I was 16. It was not my cup of tea working there and quit 3 weeks later! After that I only went in 1 maybe 2 times a year. I never hated their food, it just wasn't first choice to go and eat. 

So, about a year ago my boyfriend and I was next door waiting for a movie when we decided we needed food so we searched happy hours all around the area and decided to walk over to Abuelos. We were so happy about the prices and the happy hour food was great.

I love that they bring warm chips and different varieties of salsa. The main reason I love to come here are for their amazing sangria swirls! If you ever go to Abuelos, this is a must have! 

We now go in so often that we know most of the bartenders and servers. :)"}
{"text":"Very busy place, and don't take reservations for large parties. Waited 45 min for dinner on Sat night group of 9.  Chips were first, followed by Guac and their version of queso fundido (melted nacho cheese).  Their Guac is good!!!  Queso F, pass on that.   They provide you with 3 salsa's with the chips.  One of the salsa was green tomatillo which was awful. It was sweetened with pineapple. Huh??  Lot's of mix and match choices. I stayed safe with enchiladas of shredded beef and spinach. Their side of of papas and chili came with most dishes, which is mashed potatoes with sour cream and seasoned with a mild chili.   I did like the spinach enchilada and papas in a comfort food way.  I tried a bite of other things from the group. This is not going to be an authentic experience, but you will be full, nice presentation, and if your in a mixed group, something for everybody.  The setting is very pleasant, and relaxing, staff was very nice.  Margarita's a little on the weak side, so order a shot on the side for the full effect."}
{"text":"We visited Abuelo's in January and just did a return visit.  This time there were also six people eating.

The best part of the whole meal is the Guacamole dip.  That was fantastic and I would even go back just for that.  I love the choices of their \"papas\" and also the charro beans. 

Service was great and again, we would definitely return when in the Chandler area."}
{"text":"I would have to say its was mediocre.  Not bad but pretty typical Main stream mexican food. I would still recommend you give it a try. I did enjoy the Potatoes and a nice Cerveza Rita."}
{"text":"Okay. I'll start off with positives: beautiful interior. Great paintings on the wall. Our server, Jorge, was fantastic and prompt. The rice was nice and fluffy, not greasy. My steak inside my chimichanga was delicious (this is also a negative, read further for details).
Negatives: so, my best friend is Mexican so I know what really fantastic Mexican food tastes like and I'm sorry to say but this place doesn't have it. I ate more chips and salsa than I did of my own food. The Chile con queso tasted like Kraft American cheese slices melted and poured over my chimichanga, no joke, even gave some to my husband to make sure it wasn't just me. Husband's beef and cheese chimichanga had next to no meat, he basically had fried bread, which being native, I could've made him at home.  The beans tasted... burnt, which we all know is a very distinct taste.
And for a very unexpected turn: we asked what the dessert options were, he listed them and I got excited when he said, \"margarita pie\", like what?? MARGARITA PIE?!? YES!!! Came out, yeah, it's keylime pie. That's it. Sadness."}
{"text":"The service is quick and the atmosphere is excellent.  One of my favorite Mexican restaurants I've been to since moving to the Valley from San Diego.  The thing that struck me with the food was the high quality of ingredients.  Mi Abuelo's Manjar with the eggs over medium is a perfect dish that really comes together when the egg yolk gets in the mix.

The prices are very reasonable and the courtyard in the center of the restaurant is stunning!  The first time I ate here, I was so impressed that I got a gift card for some friends to come and have some for themselves.  Give Abuelo's a try and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"What a  treat to eat here.  It has one of the longest and best happy hours in the valley.  The happy hour margaritas are excellent and at $6.00 are large and a great value.  The service is always good--no matter how busy the place is.  Our server was Doug and he did a great job--always checking to see if we needed more water etc.  The food choices are tasty for happy hour.  Check it out if at the Peoria mall.

{"text":"Excellent food and service!!! Everyone at our table raved about everything! I ordered the beef shreded taco and cheese enchilada which was very tasty. My mom was particularly excited about sopapilla's saying they were authentic to the ones she ate growing up in Texas. I had a bite of someone else's flan and had to stop myself from eating it all!"}
{"text":"Friend one ordered \"nachos\". The \"nachos\" are hard shell tacos SNAPPED IN HALF and baked with cheese and one piece of steak on top, it comes in a pizza box. Apparently the reason they do this is \"because if we use actual chips, the chips on the bottom won't get any of the toppings.\" That doesn't make sense but whatever...

Friend 2 ordered a chicken breast and double rice, she received a child size, thin, breast, beans and rice. Cold food, crusty beans, and she wasn't supposed to have beans in the first place. 

Friend 3 ordered a quesadilla and fries. She got 15 fries. Yes, we were able to count 15 tiny shoestring fries and 3 small, child like PIECES of a quesadilla...cold.
I ordered a chimichanga and it had the usual rice and bean sides, it was all cold and my beans were crusty.

Ordered lunch at 11:31. They told us it would be ready in 15 minutes. We get there, \"late\" around 12:12 and still had to wait 20 more minutes for our food to come out.

I'm giving two stars because the manager actually refunded the money."}
{"text":"Wow, I can't believe these negative reviews.  I went there last week for the first time and I have to say that I thought that it was wonderful.  Besides some service blunders I thoroughly enjoyed my experience.
My mom never had Mexican food before (GASP!) except for the basic Taco and Taco Salads.  She ordered the enchildas as did I.  Their salsa was great.  I loved my green chile sauce that was on my enchiladas.  And I LOVED the Sangria.  I got a litre of Sangria for $9.95. Can't go wrong there.
Of course it isn't considered \"authentic\" Mexican food.  Who cares!  It still tasted excellent."}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican restaurant chain in AZ. They always have provided good quality food, proportions and prices. My favorite thing to order there is the Grande Plate Three enchiladas, one beef, one cheese, and one sour cream chicken, chile relleno, tamale, crispy beef taco, and guacamole and beans/papas. Get the \"papas\" versus the beans they are crudely mashed with spices and skins. They also have great drinks and the margaritas are pretty good. The atmosphere feels like upscale dining with great architecture, art, music and professional wait staff."}
{"text":"Love this place, great bistro Mexican food and good proportions and prices. My favorite thing to order there is the Grande Plate with comes with everything. If you have the choice get the \"papas\" versus the beans."}
{"text":"Famous Daves of Mexican in this location
I'll pass all of my meal tasted like grocery store spice mix. They even offer mashed potatoes. Can you say Denny's of Tex Mex?"}
{"text":"Just can't  go high on this one. Good service but the food is 1979 lunchroom mexican. I'm sorry but look around, it is strictly a chain for high dollar folks. I'm not hispanic but this food is just barely a notch above spice mix from your grocer. Many far better options in the valley."}
{"text":"I love this place! Most people either love or hate this place but I have been coming to their establishments in 3 different states for about 15 years. Their food is amazing, and more times that not the service is fine. I have had instances where I have to remind a server to be more attentive and have only had to send food back once or twice. I highly recommend their pork tenderloin- be careful, its spicy. Their papas are rich and wonderful, and their fajitas are pretty decent. I do not care for their seafood, but I do enjoy their poblano stuffed chicken breasts. Their shredded beef enchiladas are wonderful. 

I do notice reviews where people simply do not like Abuelo's food- and that's ok, to each his own, it is CERTAINLY a different taste that 99% of well established chains and  mom-and-pop restaurants nationwide. I, personally base all mexican food off of this restaurant, and nothing else really measures up. This restaurant is in a league of its own. 

I hope you have a good experience with quality-- PLEASE tell a manager if you dont- these chains really want to give you a wonderful experience, but they cant get better unless you tell them of downfalls. Most often when I have complained and explained my loyalty over the years and what I have come to expect, I will usually be given a new order or a free meal."}
{"text":"We really like to go to Abuelo's for the fish dishes! I like the Tilapia Veracruz and dh loves the Pescado Guerrero...  highly recommend either one .  Don't forget to try the espinoza(?spinach) side... love it . The chips are really good. .the hot crispy ones with three different types of salsa so good. We like to go later on Saturday night so it's nice and quiet. See ya next time."}
{"text":"Great food and decent prices.  Much better prices than traditional places like Macayo's and Manuel's.    Usually good service but can be challenged when there are a lot of people.  Great bar as well."}
{"text":"I got unlucky with the server. Her name is Teresa (aged lady with glasses). It was a busy night for them but they dont have to put all there frustration on the customer. As our food came, I could hear her saying to the guy in a angry tone, \"I dont know how they ordered\". Then, I asked for 2 ToGo boxes and she said \"you are the only one having food, why 2 boxes\", c'mon we were a party of 7. Then when we left, you could see her telling other employees something about us as they were all looking at us as if we had done something wrong. 
Very bad experience on valentine's day."}
{"text":"Called in and ordered to go. Got a Grande Burrito, which I've never had before and it was good. Pretty big too. The Jalapeño Cheese Fritters are a no though. They were pretty flavorless. The meal came with chips and salsa. They literally give you a big white bag FULL of chips and then like a shot glass full of salsa. Like....huh? Ok maybe not a shot glass full. More like two shot glasses. All in all it was pretty good. Was going to give the guy who brought out my food a tip but he put my change on the counter when I was reaching out my hand to get it which I feel is kinda rude."}
{"text":"We were from out of town and we were looking for great Mexican food. Needless to say we DID NOT find it here. YOU CALL THIS MEXICAN FOOD? 
Food was very bland and was served barley warm at best.  Service was not any better.  We almost left due to the fact we had to wait more than 5 mins for a server to come over. We left upset and disappointed. Would never recommend this \"Mexican\" restaurant. Btw they have these creepy cameras spying on you at each table!!!! Say no to big brother!!!"}
{"text":"We had a decent meal during our visit to this location while in town on vacation.   I have to say upon seeing their menu, with its photos and reading reviews, I was pretty excited to try it...and it was o.k.

My son's both ordered shrimp fajitas, which I won't question...ordering seafood in the middle of the desert.  One ordered the Yucatan version which was to have a barbeque sauce on the shrimp-seemed like plain shrimp to me.

I had the rib eye and enchiladas (cheese and onion) and it was good-side choices were interesting, in getting a green chile and having many options.  My wife ordered a combo plate so she could get a chile releno and said it was good.

Chips and salsa were o.k.  Chips were thin and the salsas were runny, although the verde one tasted good with the pineapple flavor.   

The wait wasn't bad for a Saturday evening and the atmosphere was odd-kind of looked like what you'd expect for an Italian or Greek restaurant in terms of décor and tables were very close together, but who am I kidding, I don't base my food opinions on décor!"}
{"text":"Mexican food with some unique options.  Comes with fresh chips and salsa.  Good service every visit"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this restaurant, but the food just left me and my wife disappointed. The food was okay, but not very good compared to other authentic Mexican food restaurants in the Valley. We ordered guacamole for an appetizer, and when it came out it was obvious that it wasn't freshly made. For my entree I got a shredded beef chimichanga. The beefs seasoning and texture would have been better suited for a BBQ sandwich. On the plus side, our server was great and very friendly. Overall we will not be returning to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Abuelo's food actually tastes like it was cooked like an Abuelo!

I was a little skeptical at first after hearing about a Mexican chain restaurant. In my experience, the best Mexican food typically comes from hole-in-the-wall eateries. But nope, Abuelo's was authentic and delicious.

The complementary chips and salsa are great and they keep it coming. Their chimichangas were delicious as well. But the real stars of the show are the enchiladas. So many delicious choices! Try the chicken with queso and the carnitas with the red sauce. Yum!"}
{"text":"Abuelo's was lucky enough to be selected for our Galentine's Day dinner this year and I thought the experience was pleasant. The winner of the night was definitely the chips and salsa, which gets refilled constantly. Happy Hour was still going on and their HH drink specials were pretty good. The Sangria Margarita was quite popular at our table and was delicious. A friend ordered the mojito and it was delivered in a pitcher, which ended up being 2-3 glasses! Yum! I will probably get that next time we're there. 

Service was good but the food was pretty meh honestly. I got two enchiladas which were on the smaller side. The meats inside were tasty, but the sauces were underwhelming. I'm not fond of the fact that certain enchiladas are only served with one specific sauce, I like my variety! My beef enchilada was served with a spicy queso sauce, but I was not impressed. I ended up scraping the queso sauce off and it tasted much better to me. This will not be my go-to spot for enchiladas that's for sure. Happy Hour? That's another story. I need to go back for mojitos and chips. 

Solid 3 stars for Abuelo's."}
{"text":"This is a good place to hang out and eat delicious Mexican food. The atmosphere is very pleasant, with murals and many other decorative elements. Our waitress was friendly and capable. 
I did not find the portions huge, but I had enough to eat. This was the first time I've had chili rellenos with orange cheese, and orange cheese sauce. I always thought queso blanco was automatic. Nope! Not here! So if you need something new in chili rellenos, this is your spot. The rice and beans were extremely tasty, and the chips and all three salsas were great."}
{"text":"This is my father-in-Law's favorite Mexican place so this is where we take him. Food is fine. My margarita was good but make sure the server knows what size you order. We were served larges when we Ordered regulars. They put guacamole on a pile of lettuce to make it look fuller. My husband ordered the identical meal as his dad but they looked different. Overall it was a nice meal but the dining room was freezing. Bring a light jacket."}
{"text":"The outside looked like Cheesecake Factory. The inside reminded me of a casino where the ceiling is a fake blue sky. Me gusta la comida! I'm all about Mexican food at a reasonable price. $14.99 for a large plate called the Monterrey, which consisted of three enchiladas, one crunchy chicken taco, one beef tamale, rice and beans. The plate was so huge it looked like a turkey platter! They don't have an Abuelos in San Diego, so this was a nice touristy treat!"}
{"text":"The tamales where good but small. All the dips where great.the rice and bean where good. The guy service was warm and smiley. We had one Coke and water. And the bill was still over 50bucks.ok I guess. When I got home I was still full.all in all was good time."}
{"text":"Oh.my.goodness.
My boyfriend and myself decided to give Abuelo's a try today. He got a gift card from his work so we figured might as well give it a shot. I'll be honest, I wasn't excited because I've been craving pizza all day (being 7 months pregnant all I crave is pizza), so I wasn't all excited. It's the day before Christmas Eve and it was packed. Right when we walked in a hostess greeted us, and sat us at a nice little table. We were given nice warm chips, and salsa. And our waiter greeted us and got our drinks, first of all. The spicy salsa is wonderful, the green salsa is even better! I opted for a raspberry lemonade and it was so refreshing. We ordered some of the jalapeño cheese fritters and when I say they are amazing, oh I mean it. Right after we took the last bite of the cheese fritters our food was brought out. I was amazed because of how busy it was I figured it would be another 10 minutes till we got our food. The food was soul warming. We ordered off of the lunch menu and I got a chili relleno stuffed with cheese and a cheese enchilada with beans and rice and it was so flavorful. My boyfriend got the chicken chimichanga with beans and their papas con chile, he's usually a bit picky with his food. But he cleaned that whole plate off. We agreed we will definitely be back, but only for a special occasion because it is a bit pricey."}
{"text":"My first experience at abuelos was nothing less than extraordinary, right of the bat we had mr. Jose be our waiter for the night and I can't not even describe on how excellent his customer service was, this is truly a amazing gentleman who turned me and my girlfriends night into a great one. I went to a restaurant right before entering abuelos and our wait was around 45 minutes and the employees looked frustrated and im sure I didn't want my first experience to be a bad one, luckliy abuelos was down the street! So thank you again jose for being awesome! Keep doing what you are doing !"}
{"text":"Best place for Mexican in AZ.  I am curious--people who give this a bad rating--what place do you find better for Mexican?  Macayos???  Carolinas?  Both are disgusting compared to Abuelos.  would love to know what places these people find to be good--odds are they are horrible places.

Get the grande.  It is the best Mexican dinner in Arizona.  but be hungry!"}
{"text":"Great Restaurant came with my dad and we both loved it. Fantastic service and food. 100% coming back when I come back to AZ"}
{"text":"Abuelo's is always amazing!  The seafood enchiladas are to die for!  It's usually packed but if you can get in without a wait, you'll have a great meal.  The Decore is great also."}
{"text":"I really like this place!  It's great for a Saturday or Sunday afternoon lunch with friends.  They have great lunch specials.  I usually order 2 avocado enchiladas topped with cream sauce and a side of papas con chile (spicy mashed potatoes).  

Their chips and salsa are pretty good.  

Reasonable prices too!

If you're vegetarian, avoid the beans.  They are made with bacon!"}
{"text":"This was by far the worst Mexican food I have ever eaten. I saw the mixed reviews and was in the area, and decided to try it out. 
      The queso. Velveeta cheese and rotel tomatoes and chillies. Although the chips are good, this was only so-so. Thanks to yelp we didn't have to pay for it! Free from the check in. 
      My friend and I shared two meals. One was one of the feasts. It came with lots of different things. All of which were disgusting. 
      The staff there are super nice. Our waitress was friendly and kept up with drinks and chips, so we tipped her well. We even met the manager, who also was super nice (and comped our meal). 
      Some suggestions: change the cook, or your ingredients. Guacamole should not be hot in an enchilada. Queso should not be made with velveeta at a restaurant. The prices are way too high. This is not authentic food and it makes my tummy sad (and sick)."}
{"text":"The foods above average and prices are reasonable. I  will say that the Cheese Crisp with diced green chile is one of the best I've had anywhere.

I have to subtract a star for the rude little hostess and BLASTING Enrique Iglesias the entire time I was there."}
{"text":"It's my first time here and I'm impressed. They serve some of the best chips and salsa I have ever tried and the food was great. Most of all I enjoyed the service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"I have such mixed feelings about this place. I haven't been here in a few years and decided it would be a great place to celebrate my birthday. 
The cons: my son has a couple of food allergies but a grilled piece of chicken is a standard and reasonable item he usually has when we go out. I requested that and alerted my waiter to his food allergies. A manager came by and I was told that most of their meat comes pre-marinated and they didn't have the ingredient lists to be able to tell me what was in any of the marinades. Nor could they tell me what the ingredients were in items like the tortillas and was told that was because the day guys unpacked them all and threw out the boxes that listed all the ingredients. I get food allergies are a pain, so I wasn't concerned too much about what their allergy friendly foods were, it just sounded shady that they had no ingredient lists for any items I asked for. That should be a pretty standard thing they have in their office. They offered a bowl of fruit for him, of which he was fine with. Our waiter was also missing in action for long stretches of time. Despite turning 29 that day, I'm actually more like 80 and ate dinner at 5 and there was barely anyone in the restaurant. We waited a good 15 minutes between being seated before we received any drinks and barely saw him. 

The pro: Despite their weird pre made items with mysterious ingredients, the food was great. I actually quite enjoyed it. However, I probably won't be returning here. It was just a really weird experience."}
{"text":"Not worthy of the name, since it is anything but what your Abuelo would traditionally cook.  Watch out for gluten in their salsas, chips, etc.  The decor is great hence two stars, the service is pretty bad and the food resembles frozen Mexican food quality.  Not worthy of the name or decor."}
{"text":"Food was excellent but the service was sub par. 

When we first arrived someone came and gave us chips and salsa right away. They give you a variety of three different salsas. A mango sweet green, a spicy red and a mild red. All were very good and the chips were thin, crisp and super fresh. After we were seated it took our waitress about 10 minutes before she came over to greet us and ask us what cocktails we wanted. After we order our beverages and food on 2 occasions she tried taking my plate of food before I was finished eating without asking me and also tried taking my margarita glass that was half full. At least ask first.... 

The food was great. Order the 2 enchiladas, 1 shredded beef with chili con queso and 1 cheese with chile con carne. The enchiladas were small portions but with the side of espinaca and papas con chile I was stuffed afterwards. 

Hope for better service next time."}
{"text":"Abuelo's is like a toned-down Chi-Chi's, or about what you'd expect from a strip mall restaurant.  Our server was a pro and the corn chips were light and tasty, but most of the food was slimy and bland. This is a good destination for a big, rowdy family because there is plenty of room for kids and the menu is very un-affronting American. It's a shame that this chain-style of restaurant dominates the dining landscape of our country."}
{"text":"We wanted good Mexican food while visiting Phoenix and Aubuelos did not disappoint. The margaritas were tasty, and the enchiladas were delicious. The only disappointment that I had was the child's nachos my son got. It was nothing more than hard shell taco shells with cheese melted on them. I had higher hopes when he ordered the nachos for meat and veggies on real chips, but he was not disappointed :). The service was outstanding. We hope to be back!"}
{"text":"Restaurant is nice. We got the #2 enchilada plate which is the shredded beef enchiladas and the Monterrey plate. Everything was pretty disgusting. It tasted like what my cats food smells like. We had a bunch left overs that we had no desire to take to go. I ended up feeling sick to my stomach later in the night. The only decent thing they had was the chips and salsa."}
{"text":"I've been going here for years, at least once every time I'm back in the Phoenix area with family. Simply put, the food never disappoints. I generally stick to a few entrees, with my favorite being Los Mejores de la Casa- its basically a dish with steak wrapped in bacon (yum!), some shrimp (also wrapped in bacon) along with a side like mashed potatoes topped with cheese (can't remember all the variations but there are substitutions that can be requested in lieu of that). On occasion, at least for this particular entree, the shrimp can be a little salty, but overall the meal is great. Staff is also very accommodating and friendly and definitely thumbs up for that. The environment is cozy and I do like the murals and painted ceiling, evokes a strong sense of respect to Mexican cuisine and culture.

Also, having gone here since its opening back in the early 2000s, there are a couple items that have disappeared from the menu... BUT can still be ordered. Hint: if you like fondue and seafood, ask for Fundido del Mar. Its no longer on the menu but it still can be made. I'm not sure if there are any other appetizers or entrees that can be done but this can still be ordered, which we request all the time.

But yes, if you're looking a family-friendly place and in the mood for Mexican food, this is a great place to go!"}
{"text":"Very good if not outstanding mexican style restaurant."}
{"text":"Loved the green salsa, papas, and jalapeño poppers! Lunch prices weren't bad. Plus lots of quality chicken in my chimi. Chicken fajita chimichanga is a great idea & it was delicious! Very full & happy."}
{"text":"The steak salad was decent. The steak had a great flavor and was cooked perfectly. The greens were less than great since it was iceberg lettuce.  Dressing was made in house and tasted fresh. The margarita was excellent and on par with the best I've ever had.  The waitress was excellent as well."}
{"text":"Typical suburbanite \"Mexican\" food with no fresh ingredients. If you're looking for something like Macayo's, but less tasty, this is your spot. It was very crowded today, which was a good sign. I saw tons of seniors here (that makes sense, given the name), and it's because they have a huge senior menu for them. They come from a time where food was not nearly this fake, so I refuse to believe they actually think this is good stuff.

Let's get the good stuff out of the way--the bar. $3 margaritas made with 1800 tequila? Perfectly blended in a 12 oz.. cup? Yes, please! It's awesome seeing a happy hour on Sunday afternoon, so this was a pleasant surprise. They also had the \"cerveza rita\", served in a goblet with a coronita (7 oz. corona bottle) stuck in it. Outside of the blended drinks, it looked like nothing special. You're out of your mind if you think I'm paying $17 for a bottle of Sutter Homes. Most of their wine list is the swill I'd use for wine pong, but that's another story.

The chips and salsa were decent. The hot stuff is one of the better salsas I've had in the valley, perhaps it was made with smoked poblano? I want to buy a bottle for myself. The seven layer dip was tolerable since I was so hungry. refried beans, ground beef, sliced green chili, sour cream, guac, and of course, cheese sauce. Perhaps the seventh layer was the suspicious film on the dip when it was brought to our table. Questionable.

My entree arrived, and I was disappointed just by looking at it. Why did the beans already look dry? Perhaps they were overcooked? It was as if they were sitting under a heat lamp for quite some time. The rice was decent, but also dry. My fajita chicken chimi looked a bit...narrow, and the tortilla didn't look properly fried. I freaking love chimichungas, so I had to dig in post haste! 

Most disappointing chimi I've ever had. Once during finals week, I was so busy that I bought some fajita chicken in a bag, complete with the fake grill marks. I recognized the taste right away, and proceeded to dissect my meal. There were cubes and 'strips' of chicken...and eureka! The fake grill marks. At home, this is tolerable in a pinch. For $11 at arrowhead? This is a piece of shit!

If you EVER see me check in here, it's for the tapas and margaritas during happy hour. I'll be sitting at the swank bar, flirting with some octogenarian's daughter who came here against her will. Outside of that, Abuelo's ain't up to snuff

{"text":"We go here quite often - the atmosphere is great.  I love the cheese enchiladas, and the T-bone steak with the papas.  It is reasonable. But make a reservation  - can be difficult to get into especially during spring training."}
{"text":"Abuelo's is a gem. I very much enjoyed my food, received great service, and enjoyed a wonderful atmosphere.

Food - So I had two enchiladas...chicken with a queso sauce and a spinach and mushroom with a cream sauce. Both were deliciously spicy (because their sauces were on point!). For my sides, I chose the spinach casserole and their mashed potatoes. The sides were a delicious change of pace to the rice and beans that I usually get. My counterpart enjoyed the fajitas and the cervezarita, and the only thing he would have changed would have been more peppers with the fajitas (as it was mostly onion). 

Service - The service we received was prompt and attentive. 

Atmosphere - Dim lighting with a cool vibe and jovial feel."}
{"text":"Absolutely awful. Their waiters and waitresses are a disaster. Be careful, especially if you have a food allergy. They don't know their menu well enough to help you- nor does their Manager or their GM. Go to any other restaurant before this one. You will see a comment from their GM below but do not be deceived. They already talked with me and did nothing about this. AVOID THIS RESTAURANT."}
{"text":"The experience would have been a lot more enjoyable if I wouldn't have had to get my own refill of water and eat chip crumbs. The chile rellenos and beef tacos are good though."}
{"text":"So when my old professor suggested we meet here I was astonished at the grandiosity of the place, not unlike a colonial governor's palace on the Mexican Riviera: \"Damn, he said a Mexican restaurant, pero este es un pinche EMBAJADA de la comida mexicana!\"

First off, this is highly gringified Mexican food, mellowed out for the more sensitive gringo palates of suburban Chandler (right up professor's alley, as he's from Indiana). If you want the real thing, go to Guadalupe, or better yet, South Tucson. That said, the food wasn't bad at all, in fact, it was quite good. Frozen margaritas packed a punch, and the place is quite charming, with lots of hanging potted plants and colorful murals. Service was prompt and polite. Whether its totally worthy of being a self-proclaimed embassy of cuisine is in doubt, but Abuelo's is definitely reasonable, given the price."}
{"text":"The first restaurant I ever went to in Chandler was Abuelo's. I like their food, it's very flavorful and delicious. The first time I came the waitress was so kind and helpful and the second time I came the waiter was extremely attentive. I would recommend this restaurant, it's enjoyable."}
{"text":"Every time I come here I get the same dish, the Pescado Guerrero. You can see menu for description. When I find a dish this good I usually stick with it. The fish is always prepared perfect, the white wine sauce, mushrooms, shrimp on top it is a delightful meal. A little pricey with drinks, but so worth it!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on Fathers day. Was in town for a 4 day R & R break from Home. Thus place came up with pretty good reviews. Sat at the bar since was dining solo. Started off with the house chips/salsa. Pretty tasty. 3 varieties. Ordered a lunch special of 1 beef taco, 1 beef enchilada, papas and refried beans. All pretty darn good. Service was friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"After our last game of the PG EvoShield National Upperclassmen Championship in Peoria, AZ...we took our MD, VA, & PA players to eat as a team at one of the finest Mexican Restaurants I've ever been in. The decor is elegant and impressive. The smell as soon as we walked in was absolutely appetizing! We were all ready to eat. But we had to wait a few minutes for them to accommodate our large party. It was worth the wait. Once we were seated our server Gabriella was right on us. She identified me as the Coach and came right to me to get us started. I always like when a server can identify who the responsible party is when you are with a bunch of 17 & 18 year old players!!! She was quick and the food came out fast. Everybody loved their meals and mine was a seafood dish with shrimp, scallops and Green Chile Peppers.  It was marvelous!!! If your in Peoria you gotta go here!!!"}

My father wanted a steak and the nearby Texas Roadhouse had an hour wait so we went to Abuelo's.  He was able to get a steak, I was able to get mexican food.  My wife and kids all had something they enjoyed and everyone wins.
The spicy salsa (they had two salsa's) is very spicy and even tho I enjoyed the flavor and the burn the spicy salsa brought.  I believe it to be the cause of some heartburn I had later.  Small price to pay."}
{"text":"Delicious food, decently priced, and great service. Have gone here with family and friends. Always have a wonderful experience. The salsa verde is delicious. The enchiladas and burritos are really good"}
{"text":"We went multiple times with friends to Abuelo's. Ambience is good. Everybody liked the food. I always order Fajitas becoz they taste heavenly. They serve fresh and warm chips with salsa, which is a ++ for me. Cocktails are great too. Staff is very friendly. Will go again for sure."}
{"text":"GREAT service with a huge menu and selection of choices.  Everyone in my party of 12 enjoyed their meal.  Ordered the Queso Dip for an appetizer and Enchilada combo for dinner.  Queso was just ok.  Chips and salsa were great.  Chips light and crisp.  Spicy salsa had some kick but not too much.  Would recommend this place to others when they are in the area.  For the enchiladas I tried all four varieties of their chicken enchiladas and enjoyed each.  Would be hard to say there was a favorite there.  Waiter was fantastic."}
{"text":"First time trying Abuelo's.  I was impressed with the decor and menu options.  Great meals and drinks. They were busy, but did not feel much of a wait and staff was on the ball.  Also, did not feel rushed either.   So great first impression !!!"}
{"text":"Decided to give this place another chance. I was totally impressed with the avocado enchilada and the peach margarita. I will definitely return. I almost regret taking so long to return."}
{"text":"Food is Great have had a variety of items and have always enjoyed them! Best is the Flan it reminds me of my days living in Spain, I need this recipe...we love it All"}
{"text":"Two stars just because the chips and salsa are good. But everything else was horrific. It tasted like frozen crap, covered with velveeta cheese. Rice has no flavor and the refried beans were oddly crusty. We will never go back."}
{"text":"Another horrible experience. We had a large party.  39 minutes before we got drinks, 72 minutes until food arrive.   Absolutely sucks.  Yeah yeah \"it's busy\".  Was the excuse.  It always is.  Food was ok.  Don't order a quesadilla and expect it.  It's a funky tostada with cheese.  Sucks."}
{"text":"Living in Arizona for the past 8 + years, i have pretty much tried most Mexican food from the cheapest to the most expensive. 

However, on my last night in Arizona, my best friend suggested that we shall go to Abuelos. He told me that it was an upper end Mexican restaurant.

We went to the restaurant close to 10:00pm. and they were closing at 11:00. It was a Friday night. When we enter the restaurant, you will be greeted by a fabulous architecture, and interior design. The most eye catching design was the sky blue ceiling. It was a similar design you will find in Vegas. 

We sat and was greeted by our waitress. The menu has plenty of choices and everything sounds and looks really good. Then they serve chips and salsa. The chips was warm, thin and crispy, while the salsa is not any typical restaurant salsa. It has a decent amount of spice, heat and a flavorful taste of salsa made from fresh ingredient. Not like those in bottle. 

For those of you who visit Arizona once a year for Spring Training.. I HIGHLY suggest that you should go to visit the restaurant. It's located across from the Peoria Sports Complex. Nothing is better than some cold beer and great food after a day of baseball.

If i return to Arizona.. i will surely visit the restaurant and recommend it to other friends and family"}
{"text":"Very good food and awesome friendly service. The place is on the pricey side but you are paying for the quality and for the ambiance, this is a very decedent place full of beautiful people. I will definitely be back as soon as I can find another family member to pay for my meal lol."}
{"text":"Have never had anything here that wasn't excellent. The pork loin with honey chili glaze is exceptional. You could put that glaze on anything and it would be fantastic. Last visit I used a side order of the glaze as salad dressing in my fajita salad and it was great.

Bacon wrapped pork medallions with enchiladas are another favorite. 

Chimichangas, burritos, enchiladas, salads are all excellent.

Everyone who visits us in Tempe we bring to Abuelo's and they all love it. 

Service has also always been excellent.

Perhaps a bit expensive, but I think it's worth it. My favorite place to eat in the Phoenix area (right up there with In-N-Out burger)"}
{"text":"Been to this restaurant a handful of times .. never had a bad meal! Good portions. Great service.  Awesome chips and salsa. I suggest everyone try the blended Sangria.... best drink on the menu!!"}
{"text":"Never tried the place before now. Decent prices,nice atmostphere. Tried the quesadilla appetizer-good stuff-love the mushrooms,very different than most,and the southwestern ranch sauce.  Good sangria. I liked it a lot overall. The chimi was not my favorite,I've had much better.  Doesn't 'abuelo's' mean 'grandparents?  My hubs had a steak sampler once when they were doing a promo,and he really liked it."}
{"text":"It's hard to give a good rating when they mess your check up and the waiter disappears b/c he thinks you're done and you have to ask another staff to go find him after waiting for ten plus minutes. Those things happen but they also can't be overlooked when giving a fair review. I'm spoiled that I have such a great Mexican place so close to us in Painesville (El Taco Macho) that regular Tex-Mex just doesn't do it for me anymore. Food wasn't bad, no surprises. With so many great restaurants in the Beachwood area I don't think I'll be back here again. My beer ordering experience was bizarre. I chose the Ballast Point IPA bottle off the menu, they didn't have it and waiter said they only had a different kind of IPA, okay fine. Then when he brought my wife's margarita, he said my Dos Equis would be right up. So I ended up with a draft lager, okay it's cool, it was actually good. Waiter seemed like a nice guy and was working hard. Food pretty good, salsa runny. It was not crowded."}
{"text":"Beautiful interior and atmosphere. Abuelo's is behind PF Changs in the Arrowhead sports complex area.  I don't think I will ever be able to call it P83, like the City is TRYING to make it.  

We popped in for dinner and was able to get a table in the happy hour section by the bar.  Since their happy hour is until 7pm, we had plenty of time when we arrived at 6pm. The wait was very short for our 4-top. Hostess could use reassignment; her communication skills sucked. She wasn't clear when we asked what section would include happy hour and if the tables were first come first served.  We managed a table and got to the good stuff.  

The happy hour area is removed from the beautiful dining area, with stone sculptures and the ceiling painted to look like a soft sky. Great date night restaurant. Classic Mexican fare, with a classy feel, though the happy hour section seemed more intimate than the large open dining room.   

The happy hour menu is extensive. Food, drinks, beer and cocktails. I highly recommend their signature drink - the margarita sangria. Frozen margarita swirled with frozen sangria. It was potent, not too fruity and huge. Two sizes available: regular and tanker. -- j/k but both are large drinks. 

The four of us shared the dip trio, spicy shrimp and cheese balls. Fantastic!  We could have made a meal from the happy hour menu but you must always have balance. (ie MEAT) 

I ordered the seared Ahi tuna from the regular appetizer menu. It was a healthy portion with a side of fresh mango salad. My husband likes his enchilada platter but I had already drank one of those blended happy hour drinks and couldn't tell you what was in his dish. My sis and her hubs shared the Monterrey platter. It was huge and a good call.  They both couldn't finish it.  It had a bit of everything. 

All came out hot and fresh.  Service was busy but attentive. Our drinks were kept full and we left with our bellies full too. Love this place! We will surely be back on our next visit to the Valley."}
{"text":"Never fails to meet every expectation. Very very very much recommended for lunch and dinner . I post snaps about daily events @corbatas"}
{"text":"Pride in service and the food was amazing!! We have never had visited this location but it will now be one of my regular stops! I was very impressed with the whole experience. The food was delicious the portions were perfect and the service was excellent. Joshua our server was incredible professional and very attentive. We were leaving and 3 nicely dressed managers with big smiles opened the doors to let us out and thanked us for coming in! WOW!! Highly Recommended!"}
{"text":"We went here for lunch, very nice atrium in the middle of the dining room, a little noisy because of the high ceiling. Gracilela was our server and she was fantastic! On point! The chips are thin and crispy. Three salsas to chose. The green one was so mysterious! Had a sweet taste to it. So me and my Mom were guessing what the sweet was. We guessed kiwi, honeydew. Shoot it was pineapple! I ordered the lunch fajitas, chicken and beef, with refried beans. My Mom ordered chili relleno lunch. She did not care for that, hard pieces of batter. No problem here! Our wonderful server replaced it with no attitude promptly with a ground beef crispy taco. My Mom was very happy with that. I would suggest the chicken fajitas rather than the beef. The chicken was tastier and tender. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I'll just list a few bullet points for you to consider.

-Seated quickly
-Ignored by server
-Forgot Mom's margarita
-Server called my son \"big man\"...all night.
-Cheeze whiz on my burrito
-Tacos that tasted like vomit
-Every table seated in our server's section was in and out before us
-Wrong bill delivered
-Manager never stopped by to find out why we sent items back and asked to be removed from bill.

The chips and salsa were \"ok\"


Even though I've been in the past and enjoyed the experience, I most likely will not return."}
{"text":"So delicious! I love going in for lunch! Devin is there during the week behind the bar and he is the absolute best! He always puts a smile on our faces and even picks our enchiladas for us! They have the best margaritas and get the cheese stuffed shrimp wrapped in bacon! I also love the 3 different types of salsa you get witj your chips.Everyone in the bar area is always laughing and enjoying the vibe! The other bartenders at night are awesome too..go see Devin for lunch, you will go back a few days later to see him again."}
{"text":"Great service and great food. We had enchiladas and I liked that we could choose different ones.  Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Abuelo's was pretty decent, it's definitely not my favorite restaurant but worth trying. I went here for my birthday dinner and they have really good happy hour specials every weekday, which is really cool! But the happy hour specials only apply if you sit in the bar area, luckily we grabbed a booth but I thought that was a little odd. I had 2 Margarita Mugs for 2.99 each! 

The service was excellent and the restaurant was clean. 

My fiance and I split the fajitas for two which has a good selection. We got to pick 4 fajita fillers (chicken, steak, Yucatan shrimp, and roasted veggies). You also get to pick 4 sides. The food was just OK. 

I do plan on returning to leave a better review."}
{"text":"I ordered the Fajita Salad. What a joke. It was a handful of lettuce with a small piece of steak, a little sprinkle of cheese, and some guacamole on it. It was the saddest salad it paid $11.00 for. Don't order it. Abuelos should be embarrassed of themselves!!!!!!!!!'"}
{"text":"Great Mexican food!  Has a wide variety of food choices. The vegetable  quesadilla is especially great"}
{"text":"Everything was fabulous. I expecially enjoyed the dip sampler. We will definitely be frequenting this place often! !! I've lived in the area for 11 years now and have never been until Friday night. We were in the mood for Mexican food and are growing tired of the ones we typically frequent. We looked on yelp and saw the rating, reviews and browsed the menu and decided to give it a try. The wait was super short for a Friday. The atmosphere was invigorating. The staff was welcoming and very attentive. So much so that we came back again Saturday and had an even better experience. Our waitress Joann was delightful. I would request her again when we come next time. I'm so glad we tried you all out!"}
{"text":"Wow wow wow, not only is this place beautiful,  but the staff is great. Just would like as little more smiles and out going personalities from the front. They were quiet and rude, but our table server Doug was amazing. He kept our drinks filled and also introduced us to the best flan... I had a grande burrito with shredded chicken my goodness it was amazing, with the red sauce on top.. I give this place a 5 star all because of Doug's kindness, and how he knowledge us everytime he passed by. What a great human being. Those girl in the front could learn something from Doug."}
{"text":"Liked the chile relleno with cheese albeit small. Good sauce. Now for the bad. Nothing else was very good. Beef enchilada was blah, no seasoning, not enough sauce to even taste it. QUESADILLA AL HORN was just ok. More like a taco. Had it with chicken, sauce with the chicken was like cambles soup. Same with the SAUTÉED CHICKEN ZUCCHINI.  Might have given two or maybe three stars if the service was acceptable. Our waiter was awful. Missed an ordered item- never got it cause done eating after we saw him again.  Reeked of cigarets. Pulled plates and dropped the check before we were done. Quick food arrival- not sure it's a plus.  The food arrived moments after our margaritas (pricy but good) - hard to believe each is made to order..."}
{"text":"Food is good, but the drinks are well below par. If you want good food and a beer, then this place is great."}
{"text":"The chips and 3 salsa's were really flavor-able. Would highly recommend the Colorado dish & spinach enchilada dish. The service was fast, prompt and friendly. Will be back again."}
{"text":"My husband and I moved from Southern California about a month ago and we we're looking for authentic Mexican food. We decided on Abuelo's last Saturday night. It was a little busy with Spring training but we were able to walk in and got a spot at the bar. It was happy hour so we both got drinks and upgraded to grande for .25 cents. Can't go wrong with Margaritas and piña colada's. Our food was delicious and came out fast for how busy they were. Can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"Not real impressed versus the size of the bill. Stay away from the $6.69 (house) margarita.  I love Mexican food so I was kinda looking for maybe something else in the carnitas and shredded beef enchiladas.
The service staff were polite and on their toes.

This was lunch on 2-12-2015 (1:16 pm)."}
{"text":"This is fast food with 5* presentation.  The meals are H U G E and presented on a very hot platter, and I am not exagerating when I say PLATTER.  I took the easy route and had one shredded beef burrito without the cheese sauce accompanied by their mexican rice and refried bean.  It was flavorful and the beef was very tender but not like I remember the small personally owned restaurants I have eaten in out west.  Thinking of it brings on a flood of desire for something authentic which is only available if you know how to do it at home here in the east.  My Son \"LOVES\" it.  It was 4 types of burritos, all the sides, and a huge take out container for lunch the next day and he was thrilled to ge his mexican fix :).  I was thrilled to see him relax over all that food, and come out after eating a human sized portion with lots of left overs.  Life is grand.  Next week, who knows what flavor experience we will have.  We are tossing around middle eastern but I am going to search the web for something special.  Who knows, maybe I'll win tickets to Mexico city.  God what a culinary thrill that would be.  (I think I saw that on \"NO RESERVATIONS:)"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch...Eat at the bar please?  Be prepared, great ambiance, but usually an older crowd.  I like the bar since the servers are older and more polite and know what food is good to order.  

I would give it a 4 star, but 2 visits resulted in poor service from servers.  I get great service at the bar however?  Note sometimes Costco has a gift card $79.99 for $100 worth of food!  If you plan on visiting this place more then a few times stop at Costco and get that gift card."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE Abuelos!  Upon walking in, the actual restaurant is unique and beautiful.  The classic Mexican \"old-world\" architecture makes you feel like you're in a new world! 

The menu contains so many different delicious options!  From traditional, classic dishes like Tacos and Enchiladas to an assortment of creative seafood options, you will have the hardest time deciding what to order.  I always get the same thing when I come to Abuelos.  It is truly extraordinary!  It's called the Chile Manzanillo.  It's a decent sized poblano chile stuffed with fresh crab and smothered in a lobster, scallop cheese sauce!  They pair it with fresh steamed broccoli and savory Mexican rice.  It's very rich but seriously truly AMAZING!  

You may have a tough time finishing your meal after going through about ten baskets of their great chips and salsa! haha!"}
{"text":"Great looking restaurant inside and out. Service is awesome, food is decent and prices aren't too bad. Enchiladas and burritos are delicious. Beans and rice are pretty good, too."}
{"text":"Being from San Antonio, I love me some Tex-Mex and this place is the closest thing I have tried in Arizona that comes close to the food we have in Texas.  The enchiladas Itzel were so good and cheesy that I actually came here twice on my vacation in Phoenix.  The restaurant is extremely clean and the decor is like that of cheesecake factory, however unlike cheesecake the prices are what you would expect from an Mexican restaurant.  The service was exceptional and really made my anniversary.  Would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I was born and raised in Texas and moved here 3 years ago.  Mexican food has been my favorite since I was in the egg.  
What you people here in Arizona call Mexican food is equivalent to a gas station taco in Texas, no offense, but you know how Mexican food differs from state to state and everyone loves what they're used to... even when it's shameful!
I rarely eat Mexican food these days unless it's a burrito, cause you can mess up a burrito... very often. 
I don't remember the Abuelo's back home being this delicious, so maybe I'm just homesick, but the first time I ate here, I had to excuse myself to have a cry in the bathroom -- I was so happy.  Tex-Mex has it's own name against the rest of Mexican food for a reason. 
The atmosphere here is soft and comfortable, and the service is exceptional.  It is a bit pricy, but the portions are... Shall I say it? Alright, Texas sized and it doesn't taste like it been rolled in dirt and places under a heat lamp for 12 years. 
Take it from a Texan, this is Tex-Mex, and if you don't like it, then you're simply partial to your own state's form of Mexican food... which makes me a very sad man.
As far as the bar is concerned, my mojito was overpriced and too sweet and my beer was just overpriced but still delicious."}
{"text":"I ate dinner here with coworkers after work last night.  I was impressed that they have a gluten free menu, and it was not as sparse as many restaurants, it offered a decent selection. I opted for the bacon wrapped shrimp fajitas. Our food came in out pretty quickly. My meal came with all the usual fajita makings (sour cream, shredded cheese, guac, lettuce), plus a cilantro lime rice and a side of charro beans. I chose the romaine leaves for my fajitas, in an attempt to be healthy, but the corn tortillas would have been a far better choice to hold the jumbo shrimp and all the fajita makings. My bad. The beans and rice were average in my opinion, however, the shrimp was wonderfully done, very tasty.  Our server (Sarah?) was on the ball and our table of 5 kept her on her toes. She did not disappoint. My work peers also enjoyed their meals, which included a chocolate molten cake and a cheesecake. I think the only GF option for dessert would be the flan but I was already pretty overloaded with dairy and quite full so refrained but would like to try it next time I'm there. And I do hope there is a next time!"}
{"text":"Really delicious food. Excellent service!
Call ahead seating worked. Drinks a little light. Every dish was very tasty."}
{"text":"Loved it, great food, margaritas, and fantastic service"}
{"text":"Everything I've had here is like an enchilada.  Even if it isn't an enchilada, it's a sloppy liquidy mess of food.  It's an enchilada place!  That's ok.

My parents are in love with Abeulos because they're from Connecticut and when they think Mexican food, they think enchiladas as it's all they know.

The place is pricey for what you get.  $15-20 for a couple mediocre, small enchiladas.  I won't ever be going here on my own.  When I go with them I order the cheapest thing on the menu.
  
Of note is something strange.  Abuelos has three salsas that come with chips when you sit down.  One is ok, and the other two are terrible.  They are very, very bad.  Here in Arizona, I can find the best salsas I have ever had.  But not at Abuelos.  Just everywhere else.  One is green and very sweet.  It must have a lot of sugar in it because no fruit is that sweet.  Weird."}
{"text":"I've never heard of this restaurant and when I did, I had no interest of going. BUT, I was in the Arrowhead area for a beauty appointment and my friends wanted to get together for a dinner. Since I was already in the area, and since it was within driving distance for my friends, they suggested we meet at Abuelo's.

I of course assumed there would be absolutely nothing here for me. I don't eat meat, egg, or dairy and I avoid canola/vegetable oil, non-organic corn, etc. Some may say I'm a \"picky eater\" but I say I'm an educated one. I had stopped at Sprouts prior to coming and stocked up on snacks because what's this restaurant going to have for me? NOTHING!

I came early to ask the staff if they had a vegan menu, the hostess asked her regional manager and he said that they do not but that they can accommodate. \"Yeah, sure, sure,\" I thought, \"he probably doesn't even know why vegan means\" I also thought to myself. He stated that he will come to my table and go over the menu options once I am seated. I somewhat was feeling better but not really because restaurants always say that, but are completely uneducated what vegan means. I didn't get my hopes up.

Once I was seated he really did come to my table and talk to me about what my options were. I was shocked. He even went over what the ingredients were in the guacamole, the rice, the beans, etc. WHAT!!! Can it be! Then he said that he will check the ingredients in the corn tortillas or I can have my veggies in a lettuce wrap! WHAT!!! Then I asked him about EVOO instead of vegetable/canola oil and he said they absolutely can accommodate! WHAT!!! Can you say how incredibly shocked I was that 1. He was educated. 2. He ACTUALLY cared! 3. He didn't make up stuff, like on the tortillas, he said he would check the ingredients instead of, \"I think they are vegan.\" Which is what I usually hear.

All my friends were really impressed by this. My server informed me that the regional manager was actually making my meal himself. I'm still so shocked I can't believe it. Our server informed me that the regional managers name was George (I believe is what he said), I tried to look for him after to personally thank him again, but was unable to find him.

5 stars strictly goes to Abuelo's regional manager, George! Thank you for being educated but also for actually caring! Whoever is his manager NEEDS to recognize him! His style of managing and how caring he was is so rare to find in the industry."}
{"text":"Love come here before on several occasions and been impressed with both the food and the service.

 This occasion was no exception. I came with my family and my mother. We were promptly greeted and seated. 

The waitress didn't pressure us to order and encouraged us to take our time. We opted not to order appetizers since the chips and variety of salsas was plenty.

The choices of the night were the Monterey platter for mom, stuffed chicken medallions for me, the fajita chimichanga for my wife, and the taco and fries for my daughter.

I must start with the kids taco. For once I can say that it was a taco that I was honestly impressed with and would have welcomed to eat myself.

The chicken medallions were quite good and I would certainly order them again. They were moist and cooked to perfection. The papas that accompanied them were also incredible. For once the rice at a Mexican restaurant was not only edible, but also different in a good way and tasty.

The Monterey platter was enormous and presented plenty of leftovers for the next day. My mom loved it. The only downside was the piece of plastic in the guacamole that she encountered. An apparent corner from the guacamole cream the add their avocados to when they make guacamole. Don't get me wrong, the guacamole is delicious. This was brought to managements attention and dealt with immediately and in a very satisfying manner with the apologies of the staff. I only include this bit to show how good the service is. 

The fajita chimi looked good and must have been since my wife wouldn't let me near it.... jokes on her.... I'm attacking her leftovers tonight when she goes to sleep.

The meal itself was very satisfying and delicious.  The service was good and we will definitely return."}
{"text":"best food ive had in a while totally recommend the green salsa and the spinach enchilada best ever"}
{"text":"I went here with family, and as Simon Cowell might say:

\"It was rather forgettable\"

There really was nothing special about my enchiladas... not a damn thing, i can go to my local, or your local, or even my grandmas local taqueria and get the same thing if not better for the price.

The place sure does have a pretty courtyard though!"}
{"text":"Tasty food, refreshing beverages, and excellent, attentive service. Wish they had a call-ahead seating option, but didn't wait too long (5 mins) for a table for 4 at 5:00 on a Sunday. Atmosphere was open, festive,and roomy. Would return and would recommend the trio fajitas."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here for a date on Friday night. It was lovely! The restaurant was beautiful and the servers were very friendly and quick. We ordered a few adult beverages, a side of guacamole for the chips, and The Grande (Thee enchiladas - one beef, one cheese and one sour cream chicken - a cheese chile relleno, tamale, crispy beef taco and guacamole). I am so glad we shared this meal because it was a BEAST! It was so tasty that I could not stop eating. I am drooling thinking about their food right now. There were no leftovers to take home. 

I also thought the little touch screen on the table was cool. You can pay $1.99 to order games (we did not), order food, and pay your bill. We used it to pay the bill which let us leave as soon as we wanted. This is a really neat piece of technology that I hope to see in more places in the future. For those who do not like it they can always set it aside if they want the slower, old fashioned way of cashing out."}
{"text":"Great service, great meal.  Medalions cooked to perfection, very good margaritas, the Flan was worth writing home about.  It could  be called Crema Catalan.  Excellent."}
{"text":"If you want a large chain version of bland Mexican dishes prepared for the masses, then this place is for you. The food was under flavored; the service slow; we had fajitas for 2. I see no compelling reason to go back. There are many better options for classic and bold Mexican flavors to choose from."}
{"text":"Abuelo's has good Tex-Mex food!! The portions are huge and the prices are very fair!! The taste and quality of the food is what takes us back! Last night, our server Zak was OUTSTANDING and an ASSET to the company!! He was so very busy, but was very organized and swift, but not rushed. Despite being so extremely busy, he offered to take a picture of us at our table when he observed that we were taking pictures of each other. THAT was unexpected and very much appreciated!! EXCELLENT SERVICE, Zak!!

I had called earlier in the day on a Thursday to inquire as to when it got busy for dinner. I was told they get busy at 6:00. Well, we arrived at 4:50 p.m. on a Thursday evening and there was already a wait!!! This place is quite popular!! The food, the service and the atmosphere are very enjoyable!! Going back soon!!!"}
{"text":"I have visited Abuelo's many time at different locations and the service is always good no matter which location. 
One of my favorite dishes is the chicken and zucchini in a cream sauce. The sauce is is well balanced and very tasteful . The portions are big but they have a Senior menu and a lunch menu with same choices and smaller portions.
I would not say this is the most authentic mexican food but is probably one of my favorite mexican restaurants in the area and I like it because it offers a variety of dishes besides the traditional tex-mex ones."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! 
Great enchiladas, service, and salsa. Clean, fast service. A nice happy hour menu, and a great summer watermelon margarita."}
{"text":"I've been playing Clash of Clans a lot, so that's probably why I ordered the Pescadero Guerrero (Fisherman Warrior) in a restaurant I've never been in.  Excellent choice!  Very fresh ingredients in a white wine béchamel accompanied by very fresh veg and lime cilantro rice.  No joke about the rice; if you don't care for cilantro ask to substitute.
The salsa is clearly house made and  delicious, there's a sweet, a mild and a hot; something for all.  Quite good.  Excellent chips, paper thin and crisp.
House margarita, thumbs up.  Cavernous place with a good Latin beat.  Service is very good and so is the flan.  (I'm a flan fan.)
Worth a re-visit for sure."}
{"text":"As an update, this was our first visit and it was between lunch and dinner times as this is our time to beat the crowds.  I believe there may have been a shift change while we were there but we didn't experience any interruptions in our service.  Thanks again for a great experience.  We will be back soon."}
{"text":"I came here for a birthday dinner after not having been here probably four years. I loved it the first time I came here and not much has changed, to be honest. The food is always on point and delicious and I love the atmosphere in Abuelo's. I met my party here so I can't comment on how long it took for us to get our table but I will say that it took several minutes for us to get greeted by our server. However, once she got to us, it was mostly smooth sailing from there.

I think one of the things I love the most about Abuelo's is how extensive the menu is - there's bound to be something for everyone! For me, their enchiladas are what I go for immediately. I don't like red enchilada sauce (cardinal sin to some, I'm sure) so I love that they have not only  a green sauce, but a few others that I can put on top of my enchiladas. Personally, my favorite is their sour cream sauce. Seriously so good! I also had their swirled margarita, which is a traditional margarita with a sangria swirl. Whoever thought of this needs a medal, because it was amazing!

Overall, I really enjoy Abuelo's but I think that the attentiveness of their servers could improve."}
{"text":"Been almost a year now and have had great experiences and have a few friends that stop by regularly. Appetizers have been consistent the entire time. Prime Rib has been consistently good. Drinks have always been cold. 

Service for us is always great, we almost always sit at the bar n the ENTIRE staff are great.

1st Time here i would suggest.
Happy Hour 
Margaritas or Kiltlifter LARGE
Alambre Camarones
Pork Carnitas
Mexican Shrimp Cocktail (The Acapulco is also very good)

Enjoy and say hi if u see me n the wife there. !!"}
{"text":"Very open and interesting decor. We were sat promptly and our waitress came over and greeted us. Chips and salsa were delivered. Chips were very light and salsa very good. Somewhere between getting our water and coming back to our table our waitress coped an attitude. It's amazing how your whole experience can be determined about the attitude of your server. We had several questions and it was like pulling teeth to get an answer. She even rolled her eyes at one of them. Well anyways the food was good and since I am just visiting the area, not sure I will have the opportunity to return."}
{"text":"I am hemming and hawing about 3 or 4 stars.  I'm going to go with 4 because I have had so many bad dining experiences at chains lately.  This, obviously, was not one of the bad ones.  

First, let me say thank you to Abuelos for having a decent happy hour (gasp, seven days a week).  The drinks are priced great and there is a large variety of food at very low prices.  Second, this place was packed when we went in.  It was either sneak into a seat at the bar or wait 30 minutes.  We chose the bar.  The service was very fast and attentive despite the crowd.  Third, and finally, the food was genuinely good.  The ingredients were fresh, the salsas were flavorful, the chips light and crispy and it was all presented nicely. 

I know that normally decent food, served properly by people who are attentive should not be that big of a deal but, lately I have a hard time finding even the basics.  It was very nice to go out, order something interesting and be served the food just as it should be."}
{"text":"My wife and I visited this restaurant twice while on vacation in January, 2015. The restaurant was busy, but we were seated right away both times. It is one of the fanciest Mexican restaurants that I have ever visited, but attire is casual. Though busy, it was not very noisy. Once seated we were presented with 3 salsas (green, mild red, hot red) with thin tortilla chips and all were very good. The supersized margaritas were especially tasty. Our entress consisted of the beef and cheese enchilada and Tilapia Veracruz. Both dishes were very good and had good sides to accompany them. We did not do dessert. Overall Abuelo's presents an upscale Mexican restaurant atmosphere with very good food, good service, and the ability to check out via a computer at your table. I would recommend it"}
{"text":"For Mexican food in the Phoenix area, this restaurant is our first choice. We have visited the Abuelo's near Arrowhead Center many times. It usually is quite busy any day of the week, but expect long waits an Friday and Saturdays. The chips and salsa they serve are best of all with  thin,crispy chips and 3 kinds of salsa. My wife and I will usually order the \"skinny\" margaritas which have less sweetness than the regular margaritas. I have tried multiple entrees and have never been disappointed. I especially like the tilapia. Service is usually quick, even on busy nights. Food is of good quality, prepared well, and nicely plated. Prices may be a little higher than other Mexican restaurants, but well worth it for the food and ambiance."}
{"text":"Dang. Amazing food quality and the best happy hour. Great service. Group of 4 and we were all amazed. Wish we lived here, Its our new favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"A little bit more expensive for the typical free chips and salsa authentic Mexican restaurant. Even the staff is dressed up more than you would expect. Drinks are also very expensive but really good. They give you a trio of salsas, unlimited, with chips to start. I always fill up on that LOL. Then I got the chicken fajita. My girlfriend got the steak fajita and my sister got the pork tenderloin brigade. No complaints about any of the food. It was peak dinner hours and there was only one other table in the restaurant besides us- not sure if this is typical for this place. I wasn't complaining though because we were just enjoying each other's company. All in all I would go back. staff was friendly food was excellent. What more could you ask for."}
{"text":"I went here tonight for a meetup group and the host was very friendly and helpful.  This place gets a solid 3 stars.  Nice waitress, clean and very good atmosphere.  The food is kinda what you would expect from a slightly upscale American chain restaurant.   I had the salmon, veggies and rice-and except for the cilantro in the rice and the cheese sauce on the salmon, you wouldn't consider it Mexican food...let alone authentic. Nothing amazing but not so terrible either."}
{"text":"Yow! Has it really 4 years since I wrote Abuelo's off as disappointingly bland? I have to remedy that. Along the way, they've found their footing again. On top of that, there have been several menu changes for the better. Whether you want mild or a kick in the mouth, they've got you covered. The menu's expanded to the point it even includes some less-common dishes you'd be hard-pressed to find elsewhere. 

And oh my God, you guys, the carnitas, oh my God. They originally introduced it as a weekend special--basic carnitas tacos--and it's since colonized a half-dozen entrees. EAT IT.

Service has been impeccable without fail."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times now, and the service is really great! Big place, have never had to wait for a table. Food is good, too. Reminds me a lot of the Tex-Mex I might get back home in the Corpus Christi area."}
{"text":"I had a date with Mama Jo last night and she chose Abuelo's. Though she pronounced it Aruba's. And the Ablegos. We finallly figured it out and arrived to a very bustling restaurant.

It definitely has the look of a medium end Vegas casino restaurant meets Macayo's...but all in all, I liked the decor, very bright and \"atrium\" like. We were greeted & seated, immediately and with kindness and professionalism. As we were being escorted to our table, I'm taking in the ambience, VERY busy and a HUGE crowd of SMALL little girls, half dressed in tu tu's. I kid you not. I thought it was teen drag night at a gay bar for a moment. 

As we nestled into our booth away from the screaming tweens, our delightful, delightful server, Ashley, informed us they were on the way to the Justin Beiber concert. How cute is that? Cuter that they were finished and leaving, but I digress.

I have to say, I truly appreciate a lot of chain restaurant requirements of the service staff. I like being asked if I've been in before. The specials. Soups of the day. Etc., etc. As long as they are not robotic and comfortable and smiling, I'm all ears. Five stars for Ashley.

Mom & I hadn't been out in awhile as we've (aka, ME) have been busy packing up for our move to Minneapolis. But she is as charming as she is lovely and it was nice to spend time with her outside of the house. We started with chips, three kinds of salsa (all explained, which I really appreciated) and an order of guacamole. I loved the THIN, crispy and fresh chips though they struggled to pick up the yummy, chunky guacamole without breaking. Oh, the problems we have!!!

We both ordered enchiladas, mom had ground beef and I went for cheese and a carnitas. Carnitas was sad and dry. Much like my Aunt Helen towards her final years. But the sauce was pretty flavorful. A big plus for the frijoles which had a great pork flavor infused and Papas Chiles...amazing, mashed taters with cheese. Carb city!

We finished with the obligatory chain chocolate lava cake. All in all for a chain restaurant, it was dang good. Ashley checked in when appropriate. I noticed two other nearby servers and their demeanor with guests and was most impressed.

So, Aruba's, er um Ablegos or wait Abuelo's, I might see ya before I move!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite mexican chain restaurants.  I like the margaritas and my better half likes the Tres equis.  I am always served tasty food and the staff is attentive."}
{"text":"Okay this review is long overdue. This is my favorite restaurant of all time. I can't believe that I just found out about Abuelo's in November 2012. But I can tell you that I go there on a weekly basis to get my avocado enchiladas, papas and beans. Plus the chips and salsa are to die for. If you like hot ask the waiter or waitress to bring you the inferno sauce, it is the best but only available upon request. I have tried many other items on the menu and they are all awesome. My husband's favorite is the stuffed chicken medallions but he is always trying new specials and they never disappoint. If you have not tried Abuelo's you are missing out on some incredible food."}
{"text":"I've only been here once, and we showed up in the middle of a snowstorm right before they closed (about 45 mins). But the staff was great. They answered our questions, gave us an informational background on the wall art; and most importantly, the food was killer! It's a bit pricey, but for the quality of food we got, it was worth it."}
{"text":"Haven't been here for years!!! But I really enjoyed my fish dish. It was snapper topped with some other seafood. Pretty tasty. 
The guac was good too. Seemed homemade. It's sad how many places don't do homemade guac because it's so easy and important to Mexican food. Prices were just a little steep. But interior was still as nice as I remembered and service was good."}
{"text":"Went to Abuelos with a party of 10 at 9:30pm so we were \"those people\" that are usually hated but we were at an event that didn't have good all evening. We were promptly seated and taken well care of. I have been coming to Abuelos for years now and it is definitely my top \"upscale\" Mexican restaurant.  The queso is always on point and never had anything I didn't enjoy. From the filet medallions, enchiladas, or the Durango chimichanga that is smothered in the queso. Everything has great flavor and service is always great."}
{"text":"I find myself here about every 6 to 8 weeks. Almost always the fajitas for 2. A great deal and very happy to get loads of well made guacamole as an included bonus. But:

They seem to have recently changed the menu. Not a bad idea. But. When you have what I believe to be a signature item, why cheap out and limit the guac on the fajitas for 2?

Tried the chicken fajita chimi. So so. Not bad, just not my taste. Not a lot of chicken inside but a lot of queso inside instead. Stuffed chicken medallions had a nice flavor. But, again, not a lot of chicken for the money.

Next time back to fajitas which are about as Tex as Tex Mex gets given, I believe they were created in Texas back in the 1980s. Certainly not a traditional Mexican recipe found anywhere south of the border.

Our server was nice and attentive. He mentioned that he might be able to score a \"small\" amount of extra guac for the fajitas but it was clear saying this had made him uncomfortable. It's not my MO to do things to put servers in rough spots for their jobs.

One last thing: the company had sent us an email with a generous offer for a free dessert. It seems it is only good at the Chandler location. Are not both locations the same ownership? If so, why not honor offers across locations? Didn't stop us from ordering the chocolate eruption which, as this type of dessert goes, is pretty good. Note to management: proof read your new menu, you have this dessert listed twice."}
{"text":"A very stylish Mexican restaurant with both the space and food being delicate.
First comes with chips and three different salsas. We always get the fajita. And there's always lots to choose from their menu. 
Too bad that they took off the green peppers with steak wrapped outside... :("}
{"text":"The service was ok, but I was hoping for Mexican food. I had the steak chimi, which is supposed to come covered with cheese. It was more like velveeta. The meat was not actual steak, more like a processed steak-like food. The server asked me if I wanted rice or pappas, and looked at me like I was stupid when I asked what pappas were. The chips and salsa were ok, the chips were the really thin tortilla chips like you get at chili's. Not a bad place for yuppy-style Mexican food, but if you're looking for authentic Mexican food look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Good food, great service. 
A bit of await to get seated, even with reservations.
 Even a longer wait for your dinner entrees, but our waiter brought us plenty of chips & salsa and beverages  while we were waiting.
Adequate atmosphere, would visit again. Packed at dinner hour all the time."}
{"text":"On my first trip to AZ family brought us to Abuelo's so I am partial because of the memory of good times. There is one in Myrtle Beach we go to when we are in that area as well. Since I was back in AZ had to go to Abuelo's and grab some lunch. Ended up there at the odd time of too late for lunch, too early for dinner so they were not very busy. Our server, wish I remembered his name, was EXCELLENT. He brought us the normal salsa, then offered the habanero salsa.... gave great recommendations on dishes to order and when decided he had great suggestions on how to \"customize\" them. BF had the taco and enchilada plate, beef crunchy taco and chicken enchilada with the spinach cheesy thing and the mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes are excellent, the spinach cheesy thing excellent.. mix the two and it is beyond yum. Beef was well seasoned and chicken nice and tender. I opted for the 2 enchilada plate with one chicken one shredded beef. Server recommended the velveeta cheese on the beef which I opted for but ended up scraping off.. the flavor of the \"cheese\" overwhelmed the beef. The beef was nice and tender, well seasoned and the chicken was the same. I had the cilantro rice and black beans. The black beans were well seasoned and delish, I could have eaten a huuuuuuuuge bowl."}
{"text":"Fancy place.  Not great food. 

This place is a fancy, expensive Mexican restaurant for people what to spend more money than they should and get far less than good Mexican food.  I guess if you're from Minnesota, Wisconsin or BC this is passible, but it is far from good Mexican food."}
{"text":"Have not been here in quite awhile.  Mistake, When in Phoenix we are always trying out new places to keep up with my \"Yelp\" searches.   So unfortunately, being this is a chain restaurant which I do not ascribe to,  I put Abuelo's on the back burner.  Starting  with the chips and salsa was a real treat.  The chips are very thin, crispy and no grease.  Less calories.  Gotta start somewhere with calorie counting when it comes to Mexican food.  The salsas were awesome.  The green one is the best I ever had.  I could just munch on chips and the green salsa and forget the food.  I asked the server what it comprised of.  To my surprise, it was mixed with fresh pineapple and cilantro. We all ordered an assortment of the usual Mexican fare, enchilladas, chille rellanos, The rice was very tasty as well as mashed potatoes Mexican style which was awesome.  It is called Papas.  Huge portions.  The restaurant itself is a nice setting,  like you are sitting in an outdoor plaza.  I do wish they would come to the Tucson area."}
{"text":"Abuelo's. K and I met here on our first date. Boy has it changed. We come here about 4 times a year. Why? Because we end up with a coupon which in the end doesn't really make it worth the visit.  I want to like this place and I used to like it a lot. But aside from being \"average at best\" for Mexican food, there's just more to not like than there is to like. 
Our server tonight seemed out of place. Like he was moonlighting from The Keg across the street. He was good. Then he was bad. Then he was good. Yikes. My head hurts. O.K., we got refills on our drinks without having to ask for them which was nice and just before we were leaving he brought me a to-go drink. But at the end of our meals he took forever to bring to-go boxes, spilled lemonade on my foot and took a plate away without asking if we were done with it.
C wanted a steak burrito with cheese, that's all. Our server recommended something that had ground beef in it. I told him no, he wanted grilled steak. Not ground or shredded beef. He suggested the Fajita Chimichanga with steak. So that's what C ordered, with the Chile con Queso, sour cream and guacamole on the side. $14.79. He also got beans and rice which he didn't want. He also didn't want the Anaheim Pepper that was inside the Chimi. When we inquired if the kitchen could make the Chimi without the pepper we were told that the kitchen doesn't \"make\" the Chimi's, the just heat them up. The Chimi's are already made so the pepper couldn't be removed. SERIOUSLY!!!. For $14.79 they are serving pre-made Chimichangas. I can get a made to order burrito at Chipotle for half that. I couldn't believe it. Is the age of actual human cooks working in a restaurant a thing of the past? Is it just conveyor belts, microwaves and monkey's back there? I'm appalled.
C's grandma ordered the Monterey. Sour cream chicken enchilada, avocado enchilada, spinach enchilada, chicken ranchero enchilada, cheese chile relleno, crispy chicken taco and quacamole. $17.59. She made a few requests, like putting the guacamole on the side and everything was done to her satisfaction.
K ordered the Grande. Three enchiladas - one beef, one cheese and one sour cream chicken. A cheese chile relleno, tamale, crispy beef taco and quacamole. $17.59. The crispy beef taco was a crispy shredded chicken taco. Plus K ordered the pinto beans but go refried beans. Not only can't the kitchen make a chimi, they can't read a ticket either. 
I ordered the Classic Chicken Fajitas. $13.99. The Fajita skillet was warm, but definitely NOT sizzling as it is described on the menu. The plate comes with sliced grilled chicken, onions, red and green peppers. There were still seeds on the red pepper. So they can't make a Chimi OR prep a bell pepper. Wow. I also got 3 nice sized flour tortillas and a side plate full of condiments like pico de Gallo, shredded cheese, sour cream, guacamole, lime wedge, rice and crappy lettuce with a couple of radish discs. There was a good amount of chicken, but it was a bit dry and not very flavorful. I think Chili's across the street does better Chicken Fajitas.
The busser kept the chips and salsas coming which was nice. They now serve the salsa's in a cute little 3 compartment dish. We went through 4 refills of the salsa's.
Although we didn't use it. Abuelo's has the Ziosk. Neat little machine that sits on the table allowing you to order drinks, dessert and/or play a limited amount of games. It also lets you sign up for their email club. I've signed up twice but have never gotten any email from them with a membership number or coupon. K signed up this time so we'll see if anything shows up. Something to note though. The games cost $1.99 which is a dollar more than over at Chili's. 
Server off his game, prices to high, pre-made food. 1 Star."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! Isrrael, the server was top notch!  Everything is homemade including the wonderful melt in your mouth chips and variety of salsas. The vegetarian dishes were sumptuous!! Probably the best Mexican restaurant in the country!!!!"}
{"text":"Great service, good food, fun times. We've never been here before and enjoyed ourselves very much. Chile's rellenos was good and sangria/margarita frozen concoction was quite tasty."}
{"text":"I came here with my Mexican food junkie (aka. Wife) for date night and had a great time. The service was exceptional, and the atmosphere, while not true to a Mexican restaurant, was surprisingly upscale and almost Vegas-like in its extravagance. 
The 3 types of salsa's presented were somewhat unique, with the green version having hints of Pineapple?? that was surprisingly tasty. Although, to be honest, my favorite ended up being the red version that tasted like it was Tex-Mex inspired. Mmmmm.
All of the food we had was delicious. We sampled the street tacos ( I recommend the chicken ones which are actually FULL sized tacos)  but the wife liked the much smaller pork version.
We then ordered and split the Ribeye steak and enchiladas...she couldn't stop raving about the spinach and chicken enchiladas but the ribeye, while it tasted good, was a little fattier than I was expecting.
Included with the meal were beans (wonderful) and mashed potatoes (a first for me from a Mexican place) which were both inspiring.
Along the way we had several drinks and luckily the server pointed out that for only $1 more, the sangria swirl the wife ordered would come in a glass over twice the size.
WOOHOO! Double bonus!

Now on to the best part, they have Happy Hour everyday from 3-7pm... Guess who just found a new favorite place to hang out with the wife after work? Yep, I did!"}
{"text":"Food is always great. Service the last couple visits has been off. We always try to give it a chance of two but still not much of a change."}
{"text":"Delicious Margaritas and delicious fajitas! I like the option of ordering different meats for the fajitas. They are perfect for sharing. Great service! Nice atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Got the chile con queso offer through yelp, very creamy and yummy. I ordered the classic chicken fajitas which came out sizzling and perfect. They were great with the queso poured on top!"}
{"text":"My fear with mexican restaurants is that at the end, they're just another Chilli's or Pedro's disguised.

And sadly, I have to say, well.. this is yet another one.

I think I just must not be very keen on mexican food, and all I'm interested is in a margarita. 

Although I will say that pretty much everyone else in our party enjoyed the food, so KNOWING my issue with mexican cuisine.... eh

I will give the restaurant 3 stars only because it is LARGE and you feel that you're not elbowing with the next person (or maybe it's because of the high ceilings).

I bet the Middleton peeps are excited about all the progress and development in their area though... Hmmm."}
{"text":"We were hesitant to return to Abuelo's based on last experience. But tonight we were very pleased with our dinner there.  I had their Pescado Guerrero fish entree, a Fire-grilled Barramundi topped with shrimp, sea scallops, mushrooms, spinach and roasted peppers, in a white wine sauce. It was night and day from my last meal there. Delish! My husband had.their chicken enchilada and was very pleased as well."}
{"text":"We went in on a busy Friday night and had about a 20 minute wait. Once we were seated the server came over and took our drink order right away. He then brought out chips, salsa and our drinks. He didn't come back for our order for quite some time. I was already done with my margarita by the time he did come back. 
Once we placed our order our food came within a decent amount of time. I liked that they gave us three types of salsa with our chips. They were all good and the chips were really good. We also ordered the avocado cream sauce. I really liked it. We also had jalapeño cheddar bites and a steak fajita chimichanga with the specialty potatoes. The potatoes were delicious! I could have just had those. 
I am giving 3 stars based on the slow service and small weak margarita."}
{"text":"Arrived for early dinner approximately 4:30pm.  Place was relatively dead, not that I'm complaining.  Service was excellent, except for the hostess.....she decided to put everyone that walked in right next to us when the restaurant was completely empty.  Would have been nice have had a little more of an intimate dinner.  

Food was above average, although the portions were small for the price you pay.  Margarita was delicious! Chips and salsa were about normal, except for the green salsa!!! That stuff is AMAZING! 

I will dine again."}
{"text":"Ah yes, the notorious happy hour with every drink under $4. I've only actually sampled the cuisine once at this place, and it was really good, filling and flavorful, but every time since I've just been going to the bar. 

However, today was the first day I actually got to enjoy happy hour. As my head still is swimming in a good way, I'm pretty sure the bartenders here know how to make their drinks and make them well. I had one of the Sangria Swirl's, which was a combination of a frozen Sangria and a frozen Margarita. Not too sweet, but just right, and the Fruit Margaritas were to die for. I got at least 2 of the strawberry flavor. Chips and salsa are always complimentary I believe, and they're not too bad. 7 drinks only came out to about $21 w/tax for two people, so not bad at all in my book. Obviously beer is much cheaper, but I'm not much of a beer drinker, but they have an ok selection on tap from what I have seen. Well drinks are ok as well. I can't wait to return on a Monday to try out their $3 mojitos and maybe on a Thursday for the $3 pina coladas. Yum yum!!"}
{"text":"As far as chain mexican food, Abuelos has to be the best. I always get the same thing there, two enchiladas both with the con carne sauce and papas and rice. The con carne sauce is delicious. Also, their salsa is interesting and has a decent amount of spice to it. The papas are like mexican mashed potatoes and they are very tasty. In addition, all of the food is very fairly priced. I would choose Abuelos over one of those other overpriced bland mexican chains any day."}
{"text":"While visiting the area from Cali, my friend was told about this place by some women who work at Nordies. So, we decided to try it out as we were both hungry for Mexican food. Ate here on a Friday night, waited about 10 minutes to be seated and had ordered off the gluten free menu shortly after. I choose the three ground beef tacos on soft corn torts. Most gluten free torts aren't soft, so I questioned that before ordering. Also, I wanted to substitute the meat for carne asada as I am not a fan of ground beef but the waiter said that they put MSG in their carne asada. Yuck, I thought and decided to stick with ground beef. They were okay, nothing special. They do have yummy green mild salsa though, which was better than my entire dinner. Service was great. I haven't heard that a Mexican restaurant uses MSG in their food before though. My friend order their chicken and steak fajitas, she said it was okay. I wondered though if her meat had MSG too. Eek!!"}
{"text":"Food ..Staff..All on Point..Chips,Salsa,appetizers, Very Good,Im in Phoenix atleast,4 times a year,and I would definitely come back"}
{"text":"What an disaster of a restaurant. This place is like a fancy version of Del Taco, all show on the exterior and even a flashy interior but then the food arrives. If you like generic faux-Mexican food which is prepared with no care or attention then go for it. Went once, hated it, will never be back."}
{"text":"I do not know why this is so highly rated.  My family and I dined here and none of the food was very good.  Mediocre at best.  I will not be back."}
{"text":"Food was excellent! I had their Ti Risto Enchilada's and they had a great kick and flavor to them. Look forward to having them again."}
{"text":"I love abuelos! The new Del Rio is amazing and super delicious. The temale and taco was extremely tasty. Our waiter was very nice and provided awesome service."}
{"text":"Having grown up in NE Texas, I crave bona fide Tex-Mex.  Not much of it in Phoenix AZ; a lot of Sonoran Style which really doesn't ring my bell.  Abuelo's is as close to what I grew up with that I've found in the Valley.  The quintessential Tex-Mex plate is cheese enchiladas with chili gravy, crunchy beef tacos, and tamale with rice and beans.  They hit the mark right-on with the enchilada and taco, but the tamale is so-so.  Chips are outstanding and the salsa is very good.  The place is a little too fancy and the prices are a bit high, but you won't walk away hungry."}
{"text":"Even though this is not authentic mexican food it is still really good food. Friendly service, good food, full bar, the only bad thing is if you go there during a rush you could be looking at a 30-40 minute wait"}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant hands down! Must try the red meat sauce it's the bomb also love the three different kinds of salsa that comes with fresh chips. Everyone I have taken here loves it so far just wish they were a little closer to home for us but worth the drive."}
{"text":"Wow! My lady and I went to Abuelo's tonight and were both really impressed. From the Sangria and Margarita we drank (stiff, the way we like em) which were made really well, to the entree's and deserts, everything was super tasty. They start you with chips with 3 different salsas, then we got 2 drinks, 2 house specialties, 2 deserts. We kinda splurged cause we haven't eaten out for a while, the bill was just over $70 which is more then we normally spend but the food was so good we both agreed it was worth it. Next time we will get 1 appetizer, 1 entree and 1 desert to keep it cheaper. The portions are big enough we could split that and be happy. Will probably still get a couple drinks too cause they make em good. The house specialty sea bass plate was outstanding. 

Oh yeah and the place is really nice inside. Comfortable."}
{"text":"Gringo mexican at its' finest. 85 bucks fed six people with leftovers. My mom and I got takeout (so we could eat at our hotel- we're bad tourists), and when our food came out, the bartender carried our food out (!!). I've never had anyone offert that in Seattle. Maybe if more restaurants offered to carry out super large orders like that, I would love them more (or I'm just eating @ the wrong places). I didn't know it was a chain. Pretty predictable in terms of what you get- beans, rice, cheese, sour cream- but it still tasted better than Seattle Mexican."}
{"text":"Really really good Mexican/Tex Mex food! If you're a vegetarian like me, I recommend the veggie fajitas...they come with plenty of vegetables and DELICIOUS tortillas. They also come with a cilantro lime rice that is nothing short of amazing. The first time we went here McKenzie was our server and she was awesome. She knew the menu, knew what a vegan was, and provided us with prompt, efficient service. The second time I went here the server (don't remember his name) was just ok. He didn't seem too knowledgeable with the menu and had to check on several items. 

I'll definitely be back though as the veggie fajitas are really tasty!"}
{"text":"Abuelo's bills itself as an Embassy of Mexican Food, and the posh decor certainly sets the stage. Picture this: shopping in Caesar's Palace with recessed fluorescent lighting trimming a domed ceiling, Dia De Los Muertos and Latin artistic touches in the plentiful paintings (including a pairs shot of Frida Kahlo and Alejandro Gómez Arias), many well-appointed nooks for dining with relative separation from the din, and hints of rural Spanish cathedrals.

Only a verbose description properly corrals the elements of this experience - a feast for the eyes. That is only matched by the feast found on their menu. I position my rating by saying that the food is slightly more traditional, with less focus on fusion combos and more on the individual flavors of key ingredients. I recommend the layered dip, with seasoned ground beef, melted queso, guac, sour cream and peppers. A lovely starter that is easily shared by two. And the complementary salsa is above average, with a well-thought-out single serving bowl per person.

The Green Chile Stew (while John, our server, raved about it) was ok. I love spice; however, the black pepper overpowered the green chiles. The beef was tender but sinewy at points; and the potatoes seemed an afterthought, having not fully absorbed the flavor of the sauce. I wanted to try the Cilantro Lime (chicken with pozole), but it was not available on that visit.

Also, the Espinaca Casserole had some great spinach but only one piece of mushroom and no noticeable peppers, as promised on the menu. Oddly, it included corn, which was not mentioned. Won't venture there again.

My dinner companion had the \"linebacker's meal,\" as she called it (saving the leftovers for her hubby). It was the well-priced $14.95 Monterrey, with sour cream chicken enchilada, avocado enchilada, spinach enchilada, chicken ranchera enchilada, cheese chile relleno, crispy chicken taco and guacamole. The plate was scorching and the selection was amazing; something worth testing with a friend. She said it was all good but not terribly memorable.

Highlight of the trip was the service. I would have likely come back to try other selections, like some of the seafood dishes and margaritas; still, the hospitality, the attentiveness, the genuine listening skills and the efficiency will definitely make this a repeat venue.

So, be sure to sample a sampler and take a leisurely walk around the restaurant to acquaint yourself with the art, statues and murals. Tell Frida, I said \"hi.\""}
{"text":"When you ask 3 times if there's onions in something because your allergic and you're 1st bite has onions in it ? Seriously? I pulled the waitress aside and said \" there's onions all over on these tacos.\" She says I'm sorry  want something else? I said no thanks , she leaves the plate in front of me the whole time. I can't have onions. The waiters need to be trained on food allergies!!! The place is pretty as far as decor but the food was gross and over priced. Will NEVER try this place again. 
No manager ever came by to apologize or anything-"}
{"text":"Food is good service is great, and if you're friendly a person, it's a good place to eat alone. Lots of regular that's lookong for good conversation."}
{"text":"Mexico sure is a long way from Wisconsin, and I walked into Abuleo's with a certain amount of resignation that it was probably going to be a bad meal.  Well, I got a pleasant surprise and Abuleo's gets a solid 3 stars because I really liked my food.  The dip trio is a combination of 2 warm dips (cheese and chili & cheese) and 1 chilled avocado dip.  For some reason, our group of 5 stuck the dips right in front of me with the idea that table would share, but I kept eating the dips during the entire meal because all 3 tasted great with chips.

I also got the fajita tacos with steak, and the meat was tender and flavorful.  It kind of doesn't matter whether or not mashed potatoes are a Mexican side dish - they were good!  My plate also came with a scoop of guacamole and lettuce & tomato that you almost eat like a salad.  The genius is in the details, though, and the cooks really had their thinking caps on when they did this.  Check it out: my flour tortillas and the warm steak filling would get cold fast if touching a cold plate.  So my soft tacos were sitting on top of a room temperature corn tostada, held in place by a small dab of beans on the plate.  The first time I had ever this, and yet so clever.

I didn't have room for dessert, but if I did, I would have gotten the chocolate explosion.  One person was hoping that it wouldn't come out on the receipt that way, since we have to submit copies of everything in order to get reimbursed, but sure enough it said \"chocolate explosion.\"  She got her dessert to-go, and the next day we teased her and asked whether any chocolate explosion got on her hotel room walls or ceiling.  That question was met with silence."}
{"text":"Awesome service and some very good Mexican food. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is the tortilla chips were a little flimsy. I ordered the monterrey and a margarita, both excellent!"}
{"text":"Really good food and tastey margaritas.  We were in town visiting and picked this place and it was really enjoyable.  We will be back"}
{"text":"Lackluster to say the least. 
My $14 \"steak\" chimi was filled with roughly 10 pieces of cubed beef (extra well done), TONS of cheese, and some sort of green pepper. Served with BLAND mashed potatoes and \"nacho cheese sauce\" (think gas station/ball park nacho \"cheese\") 

We didn't dine in, so I can't comment on service. 
Based off of the food quality - we won't be back."}
{"text":"Visiting Chandler, AZ for a family event. Went check out this spot, since there is none in Southern California that I know of. Good Tasting Tex-Mex Food!  Ambience is great. Service is fast. I had the Pescado Guerrero, and it was delish! Fish was fresh tasting. I would recommend this when you're in Chandler AZ."}
{"text":"Abuelo's is outstanding! Each person we have met was fantastic every time we have visited. And the food is to die for! Not the same old mundane American-Mexican food. The flavors are wonderful. The choices are creative and delicious! We took our family there tonight. Even the picky eaters cleaned their plates! Our waitress was attentive and made us feel like her family."}
{"text":"First class!  Service was awesome and the food was fantastic!

I had the pescado guerrero and the enchiladas.

They make a green salsa that is amazing.

Hit the spot, highly recommend.

Even the music is good."}
{"text":"I've eaten here quite a few times and have never had a bad meal. They always bring out fresh tortillas and 3 dipping sauces. Today I'm having their bacon wrapped beef tenderloin and bacon wrapped, jalapeño stuffed shrimp. This shrimp is dynamite.

I do recommend getting a table instead of a booth. The booth tables are high and not much room."}
{"text":"I came here really hoping that I was going to get some good Mexican food while I was in Phoenix. Unfortunately, I was quite disappointed. I think they spent more time decorating the place like it was a Greek Orgy room than focusing in on either the food or the service. 

I ordered enchiladas that came out gloppy and tasteless. My companion ordered vegetable fajitas where the grilled vegetables were either soggy, burned, or quite possibly both. Despite it being a quiet time there (3pm), the server appeared rarely as they seemed to be overreliant on their new table touch screens rather than actually paying attention to their customers.

Quoting another reviewer, this place is very \"cold and corporate\" Considering the plethora or choices in Mexican places in Chandler, I'd suggest almost anywhere else, including taco stands that charge 1/4 as much."}
{"text":"Today, I was in the area with my family and we were hungry for some good Mexican food. I've eaten here before few years ago and figured it would be a good option. 

Mathew was our waiter and he was quick, efficient and friendly. The chips and salsa comes out before you make any orders so we dug in trying to glance over the menu at the same time. The chips were perfect; very thin and crunchy. The salsa trio was nice but couldn't decide which of the three we liked the most. None of them were really memorable though. 

The food on the other hand were absolutely delish! The plates came out hot to keep the food warm throughout the meal. My chile relleno stuffed with shredded beef was amazing. Perfectly seasoned and the drizzle of sour cream was awesome. The enchilada was equally tasty. Hubby loved his huevos rancheros. The steak for the fajitas were on the tough side, but the flavors combined with guacamole, vegetables, sour cream, and cheese made everything balanced. Although, it was a high caloric meal, it was definitely worth it."}
{"text":"This was delicious. I got the vegetarian enchiladas and tacos. It came with a side of fresh smashed potatoes (never had this as a Mexican place but i was craving it).

The water was delicious and fresh, the decor of the restaurant was phenomenal, and the service was good (not over the top, but nothing to complain about).

Prices were very reasonable. I would visit again and take friends."}
{"text":"It's a great place to go if you like Tex-Mex.  I am not a big fan of Tex-Mex, but I still have had great experiences there.  It is quality food and great service."}
{"text":"FREE endless chips and salsa appetizers.  My favorite mexican restaurant by far."}
{"text":"Abuelo's is our favorite Mexican restaurant.  The food, the staff, the decor, and the happy hour is top notch.  We always leave extremely happy and very satisfied.  They have a fantastic rewards program.  Give it a try ... you will never be disappointed.  We love this restaurant!!!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant. I go often to Abuelo's. I love the three different salsas that they give before the meal, All of them are delicious. The food is excellent no matter what dish I choose. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"This place always has good food, but the reason I'm only giving 2 stars is the service.

We had a big party today and it was our moms bday but it's interesting that you would think whoever would be serving would want to make sure we are taken care of, but it's sad to say that the service was way below par.

Nothing is worse than waiting for a refill especially if your eating chips, and when I get a refill it's warm tea. I ask our waiter if I can have an ice tea with some ice he says yes I was planning bringing you some ice...I thought ok he is bringing a drink with ice...nope just a glass of ice.

I ask what am I supposed to do with this because if you know pouring from one glass to another doesn't work out well.

He says do whatever you like, then he decides to bring me a tea with ice but I'm not going to drink because who knows what he would of done to it since I asked and he was most likely angry.

Just bad service which isn't good for any restaurant, regardless of food it's not worth it."}
{"text":"Take one part  Chuck E Cheese, one part Taco Bell with much poorer sauces and salsa, and one part cieling and lighting of a Vegas casino , and you have this place. 

Save yourselves. Loud, too bright, lhorrible decor and terrible food."}
{"text":"Horrible rude disgusting food !
The waitress was a total bit#h and the food was gross . I ordered fajitas and my tortillas were all crispy and tasted ancient . She kept forgetting to brings parts of my order."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised.  My wife and I received a few gift cards for this place...as we had never heard of it.  We didn't expect such a great experience.  I had combination fajitas which were great...I wish they would had more of a marinated sauce for the fajitas though...but they were excellent...plus and endless supply of sides.  My wife had a few enchiladas and loved them.  The atmosphere is neat and prices are good.   The only negative part is that grilled onions do a number on my bowels....let's just say the rest of the night was quite explosive."}
{"text":"This place was kindof shockingly bad. Pretty much a turnover mill, not very classy. Arrived for a late dinner around 8pm, noted tacky interior decor. Hostess was irritable when we took our time selecting a table. There was food all over the floor and some of the chairs inside & outside on patio. Felt hectic and very commercial. We ended up leaving. Not our kind of place."}
{"text":"Came to Abuelo's, this location, while mom was in town visiting.  First impressions were good.  The aesthetics of the place were top notch.  The table and area around it was clean.  Our server, though I can't remember her name, was very pleasant.  The food, left a little to be desired, but it wasn't bad by any means.  The beans were dry, but they can get a pass, they're beans...  The stuffed chile was an odd mix of chewy and mush.  So I wasn't a fan of it.  The rest of the food, was good; not great, but good.  I'll agree with other reviewers that call it pricey.  For the food being offered, it is on the pricier side.  

Overall the place is good to visit once in a while."}
{"text":"Like the place. I stop in here for business lunch on occasion. Food is good, It's never busy. Kind of wonder how they stay in business - they always seem overstaffed."}
{"text":"amazing food here love the salsa and chips at the beginning but gets you full so beware nut amazing fresh food all the time we come when family comes out of state very worth it"}
{"text":"Let's start with the chips & salsa!!! They were SO good!!!! And lots of different types too! The green salsa was a little sweet, but it was really interesting! The queso is out of this world good! 

I had the chicken tacos- they were pretty good. I also had the potatoes that were recommended & they were delicious! Very different! 

We finished the meal with the flan they have- and it's TASTY!!! We had the nicest server, which of course I can't remember his name now- but he was awesome & brought us extra queso. 

I very much recommend this for dinner! Nice outdoor seating area as well!"}
{"text":"Top notch restaurant. Great food, great drinks, great staff. Jose is a wonderful server. We now come here often"}
{"text":"This place rocks!! I went their recently with a friend to celebrate a birthday and we both enjoyed our meals there. I love the decor and ambiance. Our waiter, Douglas, was excellent...pleasant, attentive, and the rest of the staff were very pleasant as well. We had a side of guacomole with the chips and the guac was excellent. I ordered the chile relleno, rice, and cheesy mashed potatoes. It was all good but I really enjoyed the chile relleno. Also had the flan for desert and it was one of the best flans that I have ever had! 
I do wish the chips were a little heartier...they tended to break very easily when dipping the salsa. Salsas were very good and especially the green salsa which was a unique pineapple and ? other flavors but tasted wonderful. I also wished that they offered horchata but most chain mexican restaurants do not offer horchata so I guess I can't complain too much about that. Overall, an excellent dining experience and I will definitely be back to enjoy more meals there!"}
{"text":"Was just there today and it was wonderful! Excellent servce, delicious flavorful food and nice atmosphere. Definitely will be back next time I'm in town! Only thing I could suggest is that there be a spicier salsa option. The \"spicier salsa\" as described by our server wasn't very spicy at all. Maybe it's personal taste."}
{"text":"This place is very good unique Mexican restaurant! I really enjoyed eating here. I thought it was a little on the expensive side but we'll worth it!"}
{"text":"Abuelos is a solid 3.5 star place, that I'll kindly round up to 4 stars due to the consistency I've experienced with the food and service over the past few years. 

Abuelos is one of those chains, that if you didn't specifically tell me I probably wouldn't know it was a chain. They serve a little bit higher end Mexican food... kind of like if Garcia's had a wealthier older brother. The decor is really nice and inviting... complete with the vaulted and painted ceilings, which I'm always a sucker for (I know, I'm easy to please). 

The food isn't an A+... it's more like a solid B, but it's a consistent B. There are a couple of dishes that I get on a regular basis. One is the steak & enchiladas, and the other is called \"Mis Abuelos Manjar\". The steak here is suprisingly good for a Mexican place... actually it's one of the more reliable places to go get a good and affordable cut of meat. Mis Abuelos Manjar is basically a couple of enchiladas which are smothered in sauce then topped with two eggs; pretty tasty. Also, I gotta throw a shot out to the roasted salsa they serve; you have to specifically ask for it; it's served warm and it's oh so good. 

I've never left Abuelos and thought I'd had the best meal of my life, but every time I go, I leave full and glad I made the choice to go there. 

As a sidenote, if you go to this Chandler location, ask for Theresa... she's a fun waitress. 

3.5/5."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place since it opened in 2001, For a chain the food is excellent. The service is always exceptiona,.especially if you get Margarita as your server. My out of town guests always request a return visit."}
{"text":"Love this place.  The food is great and the atmosphere is welcoming.   This is more of a Tex-Mex place,  so if you are looking for authentic Mexican Food then this isn't the place for you.  The Abuelo's mashed potatoes are to die for.  Also some of the best fire roasted salsa I have had.  Great place for groups."}
{"text":"It is a chain, but, I'll try not to hold that against it. The food was very good and some of the better Mexican food I've had in awhile. The shrimp fajita salad was just what I ordered, and my buddy loved his plate. He's a regular here, so, you know it's gotta be good!  I suggest trying the papas....es mui bueno!!

The service was good, a bit mechanized...but again, that's a chain thing."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our dinner at Abuelo's.  We took a seat in the bar during happy hour and had the Jalapeno Cheese Fritters - very good.  All three of us had a combo meal and they were generous and tasty and actually priced reasonable.  Now the food is good buy not as authentic as some would like,  I wouldn't call it Americanized but it was not like eating at the local taqueria.  Still very good.  The service was super and the beer cold -- what more can you ask for!

We will be back."}
{"text":"The food here is just ok. I have eaten at Abuelo's a handful of times over the years and the only meal that really stands out in my memory is the shrimp Veracruzano. I think their version of that dish is pretty good. Most of their plates fit the Phoenix Mexican restaurant MO: rice and refried beans with an entree that is fried and/or covered in cheese and chilli sauce.

The decor at Abuelo's for some reason reminds me of a Vegas casino. A little over the top. Kind of cheesey but still fun and nice it its own way. Service has always been good. If I remember right they have a decent bar, too.

This is not on my regular rotation but I am willing to go here if someone else invites me.  For more authentic Mexican you can try Espo's down the street but you will not get the same level of service or ambiance."}
{"text":"This past Saturday was our second visit here. It was just as good as the first. It is a little bit pricier but you get enough food to have a full plate of left overs... so it equals out. My kids got the cheese enchilada and bean & cheese burrito; they ate it so fast I barley got a picture. My husband & I ordered the Monterey... SOOOO good. Only thing I didn't like was the chicken taco, might switch that for a beef one next time. But the chile rellenos was by far the best part of my dish!! The chips are good, the salsa comes in small dishes and only one salsa is really that good. Will definitely be back for the food and atmosphere!!"}
{"text":"Service was pretty good. But the food!

My whole life I've hated, or avoided rather, Mexican food. Long story short, I was dragged here. I'm so glad! I decided to be brave and was pleasantly surprised. The flavor was amazing. Atmosphere was very nice too."}
{"text":"My wife and I have lived in the Phoenix area for a year now. We have visited several Mexican restaurants and have found the food betwenn average to poor. Then in August we moved to the Peoria and discovered this restaurant.  The atmosphere was very nice and the place looked clean and well kept. The hostesses were friendly and made us feel welcome. The waitress and her busser was very attentive and made sure that our dining experience was pleasurable.  We ordered the Fajitas for two combo with Bacon wrapped shrimp. Needless to say that the flavor of this was outstanding. Thus far this has ranked the best Mexican restaurant in the metro area thus far for us."}
{"text":"This is possibly the worst Mexican food I had. They claim to make their own tortilla but Taco Bell taste better. Food had no spices and very bland."}
{"text":"Great place for mexican food if your white and never had homemade. Just like Seranos or any other chain, plus its more expensive."}
{"text":"Still looking for that great Mexican restaurant in town.  This is not it.  The trio of salsas are watery and bland.  The chips were okay, a bit too thin for my taste.  Ordered the shrimp fajitas.  There was bbq sauce on the shrimp and it didn't taste very authentic to me.  The décor of the restaurant is great.  Charming and colorful.  But won't be back."}
{"text":"Mediocre food and service at best. Although the building itself is grandiose and looks like a palace with an interior courtyard, lots of artwork and such, the food and service weren't great.

To begin, I wasn't impressed with our server. He forgot a few requests and when I asked if I could try another side sauce for my enchilada he failed to mention the extra 50 cent charge. That's a major pet peeve of mine- failing to mention you're going to up charge someone for something is a big no no. When I told him, he offered to take it off, which I declined because that's not the point. You need to let people know in advance if you're going to do that. 

The food also just wasn't great. This was the most bland guacamole I think I've ever had in my life. The three table salsas and chips were ok. Not one of my three different kinds of enchiladas were flavorful and they all seemed to be smothered in cheese. The kids meal beef taco was extremely greasy. 

Overall wasn't a fan and don't need to return."}
{"text":"Hola. Que pasa?  Upscale Mexican restaurant.  Service was great for a group of 7 of us. The waiter was very knowledgeable about their drinks.  I ordered soup and a modelo. After everyone was served, one of the managers told me they ran out of the soup I ordered. She apologized and said it wasn't the waiter's fault. Offered me a different soup and it was good but spicy. The decor was very interesting with a mural in the background and it felt like you were eating outdoors in an expensive Mexican villa estate. I'll give it a three star rating for the soup snafu until I come back again for a full dinner to review again. Buenos noches."}
{"text":"The food lacks flavor and is boring. This is worst than chilies and other chains. On the bright side, the service was good. I was greeted promptly and my food order was taken in a timely fashion. I'd pass on this place."}
{"text":"I refused to come back here until a friend wanted to celebrate her birthday here. Fine...anything for a friend. Wow...I have to admit that the service has improved drastically. Maybe the manager does read the yelp review....?

Unlike our last visit, the hostress did sat us on a comfortable booth away from the kitchen without asking. Shortly after chips and salsa was served, the waiter showed up lightening fast and gave us the ice tea that we ordered right away. For appetizer, we ordered small shrimp ceviche for less than $5. Even thought the portion was small, it was a good size to fill me up before our parties arrived. It has a bit too much tomatoes in it which makes it tardy...overall, I still enjoyed it. For my main entree, I ordered fajitas for 1 with all beef (you can choose two different types of meat if you like chicken, shrimps or veggie) and double size of Spanish rice. The meat portion was very generous, but it was a little on the dry side. Nevertheless, I enjoyed it after mixing it with salsa to make up for the dryness. 

We told the waiter that it was our friend's birthday. When we were done with our entrees, he gave us a plate of chips with scoops of ice-cream on each one of them. It was quite delicious. After we paid the bills, he still stopped by to give us refill for drinks and did not ignore us like the last waiter did. I'm extremely impressed with the improvement that they've made since my last visit."}
{"text":"Excellent service! Delicious food. Wonderful ambiance. Waitress did a fantastic job bringing food to our table and refilling water. The prices were right for the portion sizes. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Not impressed. 

I came here with a friend recently for dinner. They have a huge menu, and, not being familiar with their food, decided to play it safe with a chicken burro (also, it was less expensive). What I was brought at first looked akin to a huge, flat fish on a platter -took me a bit to realize it was a burrito. It was literally just a flat, super (or should I say souper) saucy burrito with a splash of lettuce on the side. It seriously lacked flavor, and wasn't worth the price. I'm sure some of the fancier things may be good, but I wouldn't eat here again unless I had to."}
{"text":"I'm a very bad judge of Mexican food (disclaimer here...I'm talking about Mexican food eaten in the US, not the wonderful food eaten in Mexico).  Really, unless it's completely disgusting, it's all the same to me.  Tortillas, rice, beans, cheese.  By food alone none of my Mexican reviews would vary more than 1/2 a star up or down.  Again, when I go to Mexico, now that's a different, very yummy story.
So I'm going to judge the restaurant.  It's actually cute.  It has a large, covered, internal patio.  Which unfortunately is always full, I gotta aks if they take reservations.  But the ambience is nice, and the staff is friendly.  I disagree with other posters that it's expensive...it's average, and really, you get huge portions.  Ok, so they have large portions at Filiberto's too, but here you pay for the service and the ambiance.  So I didn't think it was that pricey.  I also like that it can accommodate large parties...restaurants like these are always hard to find.  Where do you take the grandparents, greatgrandparents, grandchildren, parents....?  here.  I don't think it's the place for hip people to hang out, or maybe not great for a romantic date, but it is perfect to bring your grandparents on your birthday, or your dad on father's day.  Every place has its purpose."}
{"text":"Ok, this is going to be a little hard for me to review......First, since I appreciate people who help me find places I can eat at that have many dairy free options, and I like to do the same for them, I'm telling you (the anit-moo juice crowd) now, this is NOT one of those places. Pretty much everything on the menu has cream or cheese as an integral part of the dish. Even the tortillas are warmed on skillets covered in butter. So, if you are like me, I would skip this place.

However, if you are like the majority of the population who enjoy dairy products spread all over your food, you will love this place! It's not really Mexican food as much as it is Tex-Mex. Lot's of enchiladas and tacos and burritos. The portions are HUGE...you definitely get a lot of bang for your buck! Everyone at our table (we were a table of 20) was very happy with their meals....The chips and salsa were really good too!! (I usually judge a restaurant such as this by their chips and salsa...) I ended up having a salad with cheese and whatnot removed, and salsa for dressing, as most of the dressings also had dairy in them......

Service was SUPERB! As I mentioned, we had 20 people at our table.....we were seated in less than ten minutes, our water and chips were never dry......and we only had one waiter!! He did SO well! He knew the menu very well too, and was able to help me find something I could eat. 

So, 4 stars for service and everyone being happy, and one star docked for there not being more allergen friendly dishes......"}
