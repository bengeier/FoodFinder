{"text":"Très bon snack bar Tunisien. Le couscous végétalien est délicieux et les $ sont abordables."}
{"text":"Very good Tunisian food. Restaurant is not especially nice, but if you want a good home cooked meal (they deliver!), you have to try this place!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Jean-Talon Market to shop and eat, but every eatery was packed, so we decided not to eat at the market. We stumbled across this place. To be honest, as a geographically challenged person, I had no idea where Tunisia was, but the food looked good, and we were hungry, so we went in. The owner was super nice and, of course, we asked for his recommendations. He told us to order the Ojja and even gave us a sample of something else (I forgot the name) just to see if we would like it. Well, both were absolutely delicious!! We loved every bite. Now we want to go back and try some of the other things on the menu. This place is truly a diamond in the rough. It's not fancy and the place is very basic, but the food is fantastic. The food is definitely reasonably priced and well worth it.  Give this place a try. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I spend a fair amount of time in Tunisia and my partner is Tunisian so I can say with some authority that the food here is fantastic. Family-run and VERY reasonably priced, this is not somewhere to bring a first date, but if you're hungry and in the mood for some amazing Tunisian home cooking, this is your jam."}
{"text":"The Tunisian Food here is Excellent  Especially get the grilled fish (Dorade), the Briks and the Pulpe salade. It is the best Tunisian food in Montreal and the owner is very friendly and offers great tea. The decor leaves something to be desired, but if you are looking for a warm and delicious Tunisian meal, this is the place to be!"}
