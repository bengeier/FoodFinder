{"text":"This is one of those locations that I have walked past the last two years and never got around to trying.  My main attraction to the storefront is the plastic food out front, which just looks so wonderfully Japanese to me.  There is something about shiny plastic food replicas that really peaks my interest.  Also, the amount of corn used on the food also made me think that it was a Japanese franchise.  It is in fact not, but Canadian, and Montreal specific.  The only other two location are at the Six Flags Theme Parks in the province.  

This is a small cafe with only one worker that does everything, or at least at the times that I visited.  You order at the counter and pay, and then they will call out your order for pick-up.  Seating is limited to about three tables, with an excellent view of the street.  

They are sold out of many items, like chicken salad and waffles.  However, I ordered the Tuna Salad Crepe and it tasted much better than expected.  The crepe was slightly sweet and crunchy, filled with tuna salad sandwich toppings; tomato, lettuce, corn, sliced processed cheese, and tuna salad.  All of the items here are cheap, keeping most under $5.50 CAD.  

Also, we ordered a Nutella covered plain crepe, it was perfect.  These are not knife and fork style crepes, instead the hand held version.  Most of the toppings are made in house.  I watched the cook slicing the fresh strawberries before assembling them for the previous customer.  Next time, I will get that chicken salad with curry topping."}
{"text":"The crepes are Japanese style, so there's a abundant of flavors from the classical strawberry-banana-Nutella to hamburgers wrapped in a crepe! The price is very decent for the portion size.

I got a pure dessert crepe, totally forgot the name but it was strawberry and a slice of cheesecake with blueberry drizzle. There was literally a piece of cheesecake in the crepe. For once, the window pictures don't lie.

Unfortunately you don't get a spoon for the crepes, but take your time to eat the giant crepe; it is very doable!"}
{"text":"La bouffe était excellente pour un ' take out ' . Bien honnêtement je m'attendais a beaucoup plus gras, et beaucoup moins savoureux. J'ai pris le rolopan boeuf épicé qui contient du boeuf haché style mexicain, du fromage, de la salade et du maîs en grains. Super bon !

Le service par contre... ish. Mme Air bête en personne. T'sais.. on est 3 dans le petit resto et elle semble sur le point de lever les yeux en l'air. Cheer up, girl !!

Le prix.. ouin.. 7,60$ pour une crêpe roulée avec du steak haché. C'est borderline ok."}
{"text":"Had a super yummy ham and cheese crepe today for lunch. I treated my sister to a turkey and cheese, and for 2 crepes it cost under $ 13 - which is pretty darn nice. The two are similar in that they both come with cheese, the deli meat, corn kernels, and are topped with lettuce, tomato and mayo. They make the crepes fresh in front of you and it only takes a couple of minutes each, so it really is fast food without feeling like you're eating junk. We took them out for a stroll and settled at Con U to eat, but just a FYI: they come as I show in the picture, there's no real take-out package option. 

They have other 50 types of crepes (I'm sure you can customize them too) as well as smoothies and a few other things - I was starving so I was too busy eying my crepe in my hand to check out much else. Only a few seats but in this gorgeous weather, you can easily eat it as you take a stroll if it's busy."}
{"text":"This crepe place rocks! 
I got the strawberry banana Nutella crepe. The fruit was fresh, the crepe was crispy, which is my favourite kind compare to the other soggy crepes. 
Most of all, it's wrapped so you could carry it around and eat it easily and not worry about cutting it and making it really messy. 
I love this crepe place and not too expensive at all!"}
{"text":"Definitely the best crepes I have ever had. I absolutely love desert crepes so that is exactly what I ordered here. I ordered a chocolate strawberry crepe while my friend ordered a chocolate, strawberry and banana crepe with a scoop of ice cream. We both were very satisfied with our mini dessert run."}
{"text":"This place was so new that the location is not even on their company website, but I gladly accepted their opening special - a 'Nutella' filled rolled crepe for $1.99 + tax, for my perfect afternoon snack. 

I imagine it will do for an in between class snack for the nearby Concordia student population. The high ceilings and modern space has a somewhat standard feel (more common) these days. Three large flat panel screens display their sweet and savory crepe choices, smoothies as well as a full list of coffees. 

The two young gentlemen serving the counter were friendly and fun in their dialogue with me concerning the Japanese style display case filled with silicon models of menu items. It's amazing how real and edible they can look from a little distance - save for the smoked meat model looked a little pale and more like a smoked salmon filling. 

My new counter buddy insured me that it tasted quite good. I don't think they have that filling in Tokyo or anywhere in Japan for that matter, but I'll go back to see if he's right."}
