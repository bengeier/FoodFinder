{"text":"I'm a regular at the pub and I must say they have a awesome craft beer selection but I was hungry I ordered the kings stuffed burger and all I gotta say is omg the best burger in richmond hill out of all pubs the best food and beers in town hands down!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I decided to have a night out away from our husbands and children. One of the girls lives in Richmond Hill and her car was in repairs, so we all had to drive up there. We ended up going to her neighborhood pub King Henry's Arms. We didn't want to do anything too crazy, and just wanted to sit down and have a couple drinks while we catch up. The waitress was really nice and friendly. She was fast at getting all of our drinks and food. I ordered the ribs and they were quite god for the pub food. The drinks were made well also. Not too strong, but had just enough kick to it. 
Everything was fine until a couple of drunk guys from the table next to us started discussing our physical appearance. We ask them to shut up and mind their own business, yet it had no effect. We called a waitress and the only thing that she could suggest was to move to another table... We paid our bill without finishing the food and left. I don't think we'll be coming back."}
{"text":"My 4 year old was craving for Mac n cheese. She deserved my deep search for Mac n cheese because last 3 family eat-out occasions did not have Mac n cheese. And she did not complain.
I searched around and called this place. They had Mac n cheese on the kids menu. We drove right in.
Reading other reviews, we were not expecting much for the food. To our surprise, the food was fantastic. I had lamb shank and my husband had fish and chips. Both were delicious. I liked that the side veggies of the lamb shank were nicely cooked with butter. And the Mac n cheese was home made! I trust a restaurant that makes decent kids menu, not from frozen food such as fish sticks out of frozen box or kraft Mac n cheese box. My daughter finished all her dish which is unusual for this small eater.
The server was friendly and personable.

We will go back there on Saturday as they have \"kids eat free\" on Saturdays."}
{"text":"Checked this place out with a few buddies, looking to watch the hockey game.  The beer selection was excellent, there had to be at least 15 beers on tap, which caught my eye right away.  There were an abundance of TV's so nobody missed any of the action.  Everyone at the table agreed the service was great, and the food was even better.  One of my buds is really into his Scotch's and commented that the variety was very impressive.  Pricing on everything was pretty reasonable too.  I would highly recommend this place, especially the WINGS!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been in that Pub many times and I have felt welcome every time. Great staff, nice atmosphere, nice regulars. It's what i'de expect from a local bar and much more. The only suggestion I have is updating some of the TVs before the FIFA World Cup begins."}
{"text":"This is the solely a review on the food. Had the burger, salad, and the wings. Overall, this isn't a place to find really good food. Just ok food.
The burger was dry and forgettable however, the fries were cooked perfectly. Wings and salad were alright. Just passable. 

The staff was friendly and welcoming and gave good service. I was honestly a bit disappointed with this place. More of a 2.5 than a 3. The sad thing is, this is one of the higher rated pubs in Richmond Hill."}
{"text":"I am in love with this place. They have amazing curry fries and a good selection of whisky. I'm from Los Angeles but enjoy coming here every time im in town!"}
{"text":"Really dissapointed. Food wasn't OK it's was untastefull. Wouldn't visit anymore. There are much more better pubs in Richmond Hill."}
{"text":"Sometimes even I take a good place for granted - guilty. You all know what I mean. You visit regularly, you eat their food, drink their booze and then don't call or visit for awhile. It's sort of like that \"person\" you call when you're not dating anyone or are between relationships, not for anything physical but just for the comfort of not being alone.

It's a sad trait and when it happens to a place like King Henry's in Richmond Hill I feel extra bad because they're often overlooked but are doing so many amazing things in this Richmond Hill staple that they deserve our patronage.

Like, did you know that King Henry's has one of THE best rotating selections of Craft Beers on tap here? True story. I would challenge you to find a spot in the Hill that has had more OCB's on draft then KHA. Heck they even signed up to have the extremely limited edition Yelp beer on tap when Great Lakes developed it in November of 2014.

But is the beer enough to make you venture to this plaza at the corner of 16th and Yonge? Probably not unless you're a Hop-Head purist. So here's another reason, their food is bloody fantastic. From simple pub foods like wings, which are massive, to their unique offerings like pot pies (kidnet, steak, chicken, etc) without the pie portion (more of a stew with pie crust laid on top), KHA has the eats that make your tummy feel good!

Now I've read some reviews mentioning that the space is touch dated and while that may be true, it's only a matter of time before it gets a facelift but that isn't important to me. What I love about this place is all that I've mentioned before plus the awesome staff and quirky regulars. The regulars are an awesome bunch whom you can find seated around the bar at all hours talking sports and even some nonsense sipping on domestic ales for hours at a time. I've sat amongst them and while they bare the prickly exterior of the a-typical regular, their the nicest gang and welcome most folks into their conversation (provided you've got something of merit to add in). 

Since the closing of Canadian Tire and Futureshop in the area, you might not have the added drive to venture into the plaza, but if you're considering the McDonalds next door, simply part your car and come in, you'll be much happier with your choice, the food and heck the prices aren't too bad either.

I dig this place and all that it is!

{"text":"King Henry's is my go to local bar. I can confidently say that I have been to this bar more than any other bar in my life. Whenever I feel like going for a drink, a bite, watching a game, meeting a friend, or whatever the case may be, I typically head over to Henry's. 

I've been frequenting this bar ever since my older brother took me there when I was 15 or 16 years of age. He was a regular, and per the usual knew everyone in there, so if I strolled in with him I was good. Long story short, this is a bar I have always felt very comfortable in. 

You might be thinking this is a fancy or sleek looking bar with amazing food, service, and big flat screens, but it's really just a simple ordinary bar with an old fashioned styled d√©cor. The venue itself is not all that big but uniquely layed out. There is a decent sized bar near the entrance and 5 or 6 tables slightly elevated to the left of the entrance.  Towards the back are roughly a dozen booths which are fairly tight to the point where 4 people in a booth would be uncomfortably cramped. Solid for a date however ;) 

The food is traditional pub grub and doesn't take forever to come out like some other bars. I almost always order the King's cheese fries: A sizeable dish of fat fries, smothered in gravy, bacon, cheese, and subsequently baked to sh!t. Aside from that stroke, the Philly Cheese Steak sandwich is soild, as are the fajitas and Arms Burger. Please note I claim the food to be solid, the food isn't blow you out of the water incredible, but def hits the spot. 

Other notable mentions include Hoeegarden and Guiness on tap, clean washrooms and good service. The staff are also typically willing to accommodate your sport viewing needs as they have over a half dozen TV's throughout the pub. Catch you there for a pint."}
{"text":"Just a suggestion, but the banquette seating has sunk pretty bad and they need to be fixed. I feel like a four-year old with how high the tables are in the booth."}
{"text":"This bar is a great place to chill out. I ordered Wednesday ribs special and washed it down with Yel-PA. My friend ordered the king henry burger & Creemore. Both orders came with fries. Ribs tasted Great. Yel-PA is awesome! Fries were fresh and tasty, one of the best I ever had! Waitress was very nice and professional. Booths are pretty comfy. I love the Rock music playing in the background. Free WiFi (password is their phone number, its on the menu and on their yelp page). I surely recommend this place to anyone in the area."}
{"text":"-wings here are VERY good and not over fried. They will even make custom sauces for you. I had them mix a suicide with honey garlic and it was amazing!
-lots of specials and good beers on tap 
-servers are very friendly 
-sports screens are a little small in the bar and usually the volume is not on."}
{"text":"Service is good food is a nice change from usual franchises. Not the normal bar food.  Sheppard's Pie is great though my friend always has the steak sandwich."}
{"text":"This was like a 3-star pub to me prior to the Yelp GTA Rock event.  Now, I have to add another one star to it.

I had never really paid attention to King Henry's Arms because I like some places more fancy than this place.  My bf likes to come here some of the times and so I tried this place before.  I tried their pub food but I did not find the food special to me.  It was very possibly because I felt that it was not my place lol.

Yesterday, I tried their sample food - Yorkshire pudding at the Yelp GTA Rock.  They were just amazing and it is actually on the pub menu.

I don't mind go there again and try more of their food plus drinks:)"}
{"text":"Great Pub with live music!"}
{"text":"I came here as it is close bar to my house. I like it more than archepad which is the other bar close by. They have good deal. On Tuesday amazing pizza I think it is the best deal in here as the pizza are tasty and well made. Other days deals are good as well on wed they got 5 pitchers of creemore which is good as well. Over all the place is nice they got good amount TV screens and great deals for a bar at this location. I will recommend this place to ppl living around"}
{"text":"King Henry's Arms is a hidden gem in the heart of Richmond Hill. Its located beside the McDonalds on Yonge and 16th right across from Hillcrest Mall. It's a bit small and run down, and in need of a makeover but everything else about the place is Bueno. The place always has a great selection of craft beer. One that was there that I don't usually see was Flying Monkey craft beer straight out of Barrie, Ontario. Also the service has been pretty exceptional since the servers are usually very sociable and have a great sense of humour. I very seldom find servers that will take the time to have a conversation with you and make you feel at home. I usually come here for a brew and a small bite, and I will continue to do so because this place deserves it. Also, I didn't event even know this place took Vicinity until recently. JimStar Out!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Their tuna melt, sweet potato fries, burgers and sides are absolutely amazing. Literally my favourite place to eat and the service is really good, fast and useful!"}
{"text":"I just spent a lovely couple of hours at King Henry's with my daughter for lunch.  Whenever she comes home to visit she always wants to go to \"the Pub\".  I had the Steak and Spinach Salad, It was excellent!  Generous serving of steak, cooked perfectly as I asked, crisp spinach, sauteed mushrooms and aged cheddar.  The dressing was fantastic!  
I noticed that the owner's have refurbished the booths and they are much more comfortable then past reviews would have you think.  
Don't come here expecting a fancy place, come here expecting good food, friendly faces and really funny servers and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Love the KHA. A very underrated place and  a hidden gem.

The kitchen turns out some amazing food. Highly recommend the lamb shank, the jacko wings (fried, sauced, and then oven caramelized!), and the chicken curry. OMG the chicken curry. So good. Honestly you cannot go wrong with any of the food here. It is surprisingly good for a pub and a place we always recommend.

This place also has a nice rotating selection of Ontario craft beer as well. Important to a hop-head like me.

The only thing keeping me from a 5-star is that the place could use a reno."}
{"text":"Went with some friends last night. 
On the great side is the beer selection here is top shelf. 
Lots to choose from from local to imported. 

Food is ok if you like stuff from a fryer for the most part. 

Staff is a great bunch if you can understand their humour..

Atmosphere is where we need an update and a cleanup.
I think they need to fix it us after all the years. 

Price was fair considering the other local options."}
{"text":"Their chicken wings is the bomb. I live in Mississauga but drove all the way up there for the wings. We ordered honey garlic, sweet chilli and mango chipotle. 
Half price wings on Mondays."}
{"text":"Ok, my mac and cheese was a little bland, but there was so much I liked about this place that it didn't even matter.
The Yorkshire Pudding Dippers were amazing. I could've had two.
Highly recommend those.
They also had a deal going on when we were there (which our server didn't tell us about,  it was like a pleasant surprise when we got our bill) which was half priced apps.
I wish I could remember what time it ran through.
The old cushions on the benches sank when you sat into them but I didn't mind.
I like the vibe of this place.
They have a LOT of options to choose from.
My friend got steak in GARLIC BREAD.
My other friend got pizza which was okay.
They have daily deals here as well and the beer was good.
I'll be back."}
{"text":"I was invited to meet a couple of my Yelpiest friends here the other day. I had never been here, and was looking forward to it, as the reviews were good, and my friends have always steered me in the right direction in the past.

Unfortunately this time was a bit off target.  I walked in to a pretty empty small pub, and was nearly run over by the waitress rushing around.  The beer selection is minimal, but as previously mentioned there are a few craft beers rotated on tap.

As mentioned by Jennifer K, they have an appetizer special of 50% off, which brings the prices to reasonable considering the size of the portions, and the quality of the food.  The Yorkshire Pudding sounded like an interesting selection, but when i saw it, I was less than impressed, the gravy didn't look too appetizing at all, and the puddings were burnt on the outside and very eggy, and heavy, not light and fluffy as one would expect.  The King's Fries weren't the worst, but it's poutine, nothing fancy.

I'm cowardly, but at least my Yelpiest friend had the waitress take it off the bill, after the waitress tried to convince us that was how it was done there, never in my life have I heard of well-done Yorkshire Puddings.

They didn't really have anything on tap that was of my personal preference. This and poor food prep is all the reason I need to to come back."}
{"text":"Service is fast and really friendly. Food is amazing - try the wings. A really great experience! Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I'm here for Monday wings night.  The place is not that upscaled but their jumbo size wings are the best in the area!  I definitely will come again for wings night."}
{"text":"3 star for having Seasonal Craft Beer on draft

1.5 star for food

I have been to King Henry's Arms numerous time and I now come to a conclusion that I would not going to eat here again. 

Love their beer selection but the food item was more a miss 80% of the time.

Just don't ever order their Yorkshire pudding dipping. It was burnt and bitter outside and not cooked inside. The waitress at first told us that 's how it suppose to be?! But after I insisted, she ended up taken it off the bill +0.5 star.

Mon-Fri half price app which is ok price as I doubt I would have paid $7.50 for the basket of onion rings or waffle fries.

I would continue to have a pint of Black Oak or Lakes of Bay or whatever local craft beers on tap as pre or post dinner drink."}
{"text":"I visited King Henry's as one of the Yelp CMYE event.  I found King Henry spacious, casual, comfortable, laid back.  That plus a pint of Yel-P-A and a homey sheppard pie ($18 combo).  Okay, the experience was pretty close to a lazy evening at home, minus the PJ,  The sheppard pie was delicious. The mush potato was very soft and fluffy but not overly buttery.  The meat pie portion was rich in flavour and thick and loaded with meat.  The bean was super good; it didn't seem to be from a can or is there super high quality canned beans?  The pint was, hey it was a Yelp beer, purrrr-fect!

Our waitress was cool, fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Best pub in town. Hands down. Excels at all things! Fantastic owners, lovely waitresses (funny as all hell), top notch food (even late), daily specials, best selection of single malt scotch for miles, not to mention bourbon. Incredible service, proud to call this my neighbourhood pub!
Oh, and great live music on Sundays!"}
{"text":"King Henry's Arms has that comfortable local pub atmosphere. We liked the service very much, friendly staff, good food, we will stop by again!"}
