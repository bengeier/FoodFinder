{"text":"The service here was great. My review has no reflection on how we were treated. The food I received is a different story. I got the Chicken Hemingway. For $13.95 you get maybe a four ounce piece of chicken. Rather than a nicely grilled breast like the menu implied, it might have been a slightly burnt, fatty thigh. I took small bites and it was done in three bites. This small piece of chicken was garnished with a few black beans and that's it. For a $14 plate for dinner you get three bites. Absolutely absurd. The chef even walked up and tried to crack a joke on how I was already finished while my friends were still eating. My response...\"did you see what I was served? How about a legitimate portion?\". He just walked off. No excuse for this!!!"}
{"text":"What a great place. We are so lucky to be so close by. We can stop and get our oyster fix any time we want and know we will be treated like royalty! If you go, ask about the background of their name."}
{"text":"What a joke this place is.  We sat down in the outdoor patio area on a Friday night.  The place was half full on the outside, maybe 3/4 full on the inside.  

The first thing the waitress said to us was \"the kitchen is backed up and we are not even taking new food orders for 15 more minutes.\"

She didn't say hello, can I get you a drink.  

We got up and walked out and they didn't even seem to care.  We won't be going their again.  Too bad because we live less than 2.5 miles to the location on Gold Hlll Road.  

PS: I was ready to order a cocktail which they have a full page of priced at $8 a drink.  I was going to get a Mai Tai which I have had before here and it was decent."}
