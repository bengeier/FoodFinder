{"text":"Great local sushi spot, rainbow and their dynamite in my opinion are the best. There are 6-7 tables, not a place for ambience.  Most of the biz is take out."}
{"text":"My favourite take out sushi place.  Best unagi ever and I love their fried sushi too.
The prices and portions are fair and the food is fresh.
The decor can be improved, but it's mostly a take out location.
The menu has many options including all the basics and a few home specialties.  I have always found their basics far better.
The staff is super friendly, and although it gets busy it's never too crowded or full inside."}
{"text":"If you are looking for fresh, quality take-out sushi at a decent price this place should be on your list. I have been coming here often for years, and I have never been disappointed. The staff are more than happy to accommodate special requests.

I have often grabbed a premade bento box, or custom ordered various maki and sashimi. Everything has always been great. They also have some tasty tempura shrimp that they make fresh to order."}
{"text":"Je suis allé là bas avec ma copine, puis je trouvais que c'était cher pour la qualité.                                     Nous étions à midi et leurs sushis n'étaient pas frais, le riz était sec et j'ai même eu peur de finir mes futomaki. Le staff était quand même gentil mais très lent."}
