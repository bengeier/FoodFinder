{"text":"If I could give negative stars, I would.  My family and I went there for tapas buffet tonight between 7:00 to 8:00.  It was our first time at the hotel and I found the service absolutely horrible.  When we got there, no one was serving or greeting us.  No waitress.  The chef just happened to be there.  So he asked us to take a seat and help ourselves with the food.  After a while, the waitress showed up and served us the wine/beer.  She disappeared on and off again and wasn't there for most of our meal.   Halfway through, we found a millipede on our table.  The first waitress came and saw.  She got scared and ran to 'get help'.  The second waitress (or manager) whom she called came in and said \"What was it?  You better not have called me for a spider.\"  When she found out that we killed the millipede, she said \"well then\".  She did not apologize to us, but instead reward herself with a slice of cheese that was for the customers.  Both waitress did not apologize to for their poor service.  My question is \"Why would anyone pay to eat here?\"  \"Why would any manager keep a staff who so poorly represent their hotel?\"  I am taking the time to post this because I don't want this kind of service and hotel to represent our city.  Tourists who come to Toronto to visit us deserve better!"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible, buffet is about 6 mediocre items that all seem to have come from a can or a freezer box. The service is okay but microwaving some bacon, canned beans and breakfast sausage at home would have been better and not cost me 15 DOLLARS."}
{"text":"I went for the tapas buffet. The hours are from 5 - 9:30, Monday to Friday with the groupon. That deal comes with a 6oz glass of wine or craft beer. I had the Pinot Noir. The food and drink were okay for the price. There were turkey sausages, chicken balls in what I think was sesame sauce, stewed mushrooms, veggie samosas, crackers and cheeses, smoked salmon sandwich bites, etc. The selection wasn't big but I wasn't expecting it to be. I mostly enjoyed it because my friend and I had the place to ourselves for the most part, with only three other people in total during the whole time we were there. The lady minding the place was pleasant and didn't rush us."}
{"text":"Came here with a Groupon ($29 for two for tappas buffet) First of all they need to look up what tappas are as the picture is very misleading. Might as well have eaten at McDonald's. They had pizza, fries, chicken balls which literally tasted like McDonald's chicken mcnuggets. WOULD NOT RETURN. 

Pros
All you can eat

Cons 
-Limited food. We literally had to wait for the waiter to bring out more food every 5 min because there was nothing left
-NO TAPPAS (all they had was pizza, chicken balls, fries and some cold cut salami) 
Food was bland. 

For $30 go to Chipotle across the street and have yourself a feast. Don't waste your time here.

{"text":"I came here for a quick brunch/lunch. The cafe is situated within the Strathcona Hotel on York Street. For ease of access, this place isn't bad. The ambiance is good for a quick business meeting. The dining area is not bad with the furnishing. 

However, the food is just okay. I mean, you can't really go wrong with eggs, bacon, toast and potatoes. Eggs were leaning towards the dry side. Peameal bacon and toasts were not bad, and their potato hash was actually flavourful."}
{"text":"Horrible food. Buffet was cold and hardly any selection. The sausages felt like they were 5 days old. The waitress was nice though."}
{"text":"Was brought to this place by a Groupon. Never again. It was advertised as tapas food, but was low grade minimal buffet with only a few things, like chicken nuggets and roasted potatoes and some olives etc. Was terrible and I got sick to my stomach afterwards."}
{"text":"I've been seeing this on Groupon so when my friend got it, I was excited to join her. I was looking forward for the AYCE moment, but I was disappointed when we got there. 

First, I overheard the lady tell the guy that the tapas was only $10. The Groupon price was 2 for $29, plus tax and tip (thanks for the savings, Groupon). 

Now that that's out of the way, the food. The food barely had a selection. I feel like a normal buffet place had more appetizer collection than their overall tapas. 

We had mushrooms, samosa, sausage and chicken balls. Then there were some cheese and cold asparagus, etc. The food wasn't bad, it's just not worth the money. You can do better with what you paid for. 

I mean, if this is something free that the guest of the hotel gets, then it's cool.  But paying over $15, I mean, you can only eat so many sausages. 

Please don't waste your money here."}
