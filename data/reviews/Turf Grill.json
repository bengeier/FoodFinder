{"text":"yuck, gross flavorless burgers. not even worth the $10 off."}
{"text":"Went there on a Monday at lunchtime. One waitress was doing double duty as the cook.  Ordered the Chicago dog for $6.95.   The waitress was constantly moving from the grill to the register take new orders.  After nearly half an hour my Chicago dog was ready.  Came with no mustard on a stale bun, though the neon relish, sport peppers and were present.  The fries that came with it were the frozen crinkle cut type that went from freezer to fryer.    They used to have a chef who did a really good job, and a waitress with ONE job.   As it is now, Der Weinerschnitzel is upscale compared to the Turf Grill."}
{"text":"Every time I come they take so long....and it's not like there's a lot customers. The cook that takes your order alway seems to have an attitude like he hates his job, I don't blame him. They close around 7 and they love to close about 20 minutes early. The price is moderate. But haven't really had anything that really impressed me, and that's saying a lot because I eat anything. Oh its twice that the guy just puts your food up on the counter. Doesn't call your name or order number or anything, my food got cold...The only great thing about this place is that you get a great view of the sports book. Only reason  I keep coming back is because I'm always at the sports book here at gvr. One day I'll learn NOT to come back here..."}
{"text":"Tucked away you'll probably miss it when you first come into GVR. It's in the sportsbook area and is visually blocked by a bar.   They have a pretty good hot dog and fries special for only a few bucks. If you ask they'll top it with chili and cheese, onions, etc but you need to let them know otherwise you'll just a nice hot dog, fries, and a pickle wedge which is still good.  They have a pretty good BBQ beef ribs for $7.50 with a side. It's a big portion especially if your side is fries enough for a few, see my picture. One of friends ordered the same ribs but with a side baked beans, big difference it was a tiny container.   Burgers are also pretty good. Most of the food they'll grill it up right there and usually fast at it.  They also have cold subs, salads, fountain and bottled drinks, and snacks.    It's clean and spacious. Also has a long bar counter to dine and view the massive screen of the sportsbook."}
{"text":"I used to eat at the Turf Grill weekly. It is adjacent to sports book, had reasonable prices, good American food on a diverse menu.  It closed down in late 2013 with no announcement of what was happening to it. When it randomly reopened, I couldn't wait to eat there again.   Unfortunately, prices went up, food wasn't as good, and they don't serve half the things they used to."}
{"text":"This place is like a CHEAP DATE..  CHEAP , QUICK and a GEM.  I ordered a Turf Burger.. double cheeseburger, on 2 buns, lettuce, tomato and red onions.. i added my mustard and ketchup and voila! the $6.99 burger with french fries was yummmy!  We found this place after giving up on eating at GVR altogether. We first got in line for the Feast Buffet, but that was crazy packed on a Saturday Brunch for $4.99!!! So we went over next door to the Grand Cafe.. guess what? Same thing!!!  We started to walk out since we were pressed for time all the while toting around a 3 yr old! So on the way out passed the Tides and the Sportbook, the 3 yr old, saw Turf Grill and went \"What about there?\" I couldn't believe he even saw this place.  Great hang out for people who have kids and wants to watch the sportbook because its literally overlooking all the tv's at the sportsbook and they have food! score!"}
{"text":"After the fiasco at the Grand Café, we were trying to just find something quick to eat while we were in Green Valley Ranch. We came across the Turf Grill, which was tucked away behind the Race and Sports Book.  They have a menu posted on the wall to the right of the register, you just place your order, pay, and wait for your food. Simple enough. There was nobody in line and only 2 or 3 tables being occupied at the time. Score! lol  I ordered the Turf Burger, while my friend got a Philly Cheese Sandwich. I honestly thought the food was alright. It wasn't bad at all. After that hot mess at the café, I just wanted to get something to eat and wasn't particularly fussy about it. I just kept thinking the whole time that this is the quintessential 3 star experience. It wasn't bad, by any means. It certainly didn't 'Wow\" you either. It was functional and got the job done. All that being said I could see myself coming back here again(as opposed to the Café). The people were nice and the food was okay, especially for the price point. Just don't expect to be blown away.  I think it should be noted that my friend thought I should make this a 4 star review based on his Philly Cheese Steak Sandwich. lol He keeps saying that he thought it was great!...but I guess that will have to go on his review on his Yelp!  Its A-Okay though...I'll go back...one day...just don't expect me to go way out of my way for it..  3 stars."}
{"text":"I probably would say, that this place is okay in a sense.  But, probably not a \"good\" OK, but more like a \"meh\" OK.  It is a nice place and it's kept clean.  Then again, we did go really late around 10pm, after our concert with Aaron Lewis.  We didn't really want to go around GVR to find a place to eat, so Turf Grill was the first thing that kind of stuck out.  Actually it was the first thing I read on the direction board.   Located inside Green Valley Ranch, is a small sandwich/burger shop.  Which pricing is a bit more then expected.  But, I did like my turkey sandwich, cause it was a lot of turkey.  I was expect a few slices, but it was kind of stacked about 3 inches of turkey, plus your two slices of bread. I really enjoyed that turkey sandwich.  My wife on the other hand, had a hamburger.  It was edible, but not sure if she liked it that much but it was edible.    The place itself seem small, but enough room to stay and eat.  The staff was very nice, and friendly.  Kind of sucks that there's only one menu to look at, which is kind of plastered next against the wall, next to the register.  So I can see how it can be hard to read, when you go there during the busy times.  But going there at night, it wasn't so bad or crowded.    I would have to say, if your looking for a quick bite to eat and don't mind the pricing.  Then Turf Grill is good to go.  I would probably consider going when its not to busy, cause there is limited seating.  If you go when their not busy, you might get the best out of it. If you go when it is busy, then you might not get the best out of it."}
{"text":"I go here for lunch from time to time. Nice servings at a good price and the foods tasty. Can't go wrong with a burger. 5 stars being that the sports book is right there to pick some winners!!! My favorite quickie to grab a bite."}
{"text":"this place is consistently mediocre on food quality.   It usually takes forever to get anything you order. Interesting thing is there really is hardly ever more than three or four people waiting for an order but I guess that's overwhelming for this spot.  I think I saw three people telling the cook and manager. They did not like what they ordered and the manager pretty much shrug them off.  The one upside is they do have good happy hour specials and I do like the $2 corn dogs.  If you're going to get something to munch on while you watch the game I would stick with just ordering that."}
{"text":"Went for weekday lunch, both had seafood etoufee $15, I had a cup of clam chowder for $5. Beautiful place, chowder was actually a bowl, entree was full-size. Very delicious, great service. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We were the people in this hidden little cove...   The burger was huge, and cooked well but lacked seasoning.   The coleslaw was gray so I bypassed that....  The fries were good & seasoned!   Its okay if your starved  but you dont have to go putta your way to eat here."}
{"text":"This place use to be awesome! They had a chef that worked there who wore a high hat and had worked there for years. He was an amazing chef. The make your own burger, pulled pork sandwich and BLT were our favorites. We went once a week for dinner.  Then they closed it for awhile, then reopened. Not the same at all. New chef and staff. Foods awful. We don't go anymore. Sad."}
{"text":"OK, so I feel like I need to give this place a second chance. The place was almost empty yet it took almost 40 minutes to get my food. The service was surly/disinterested at best. I have come to expect more, much more from GVR and Station Casinos in general. The wings, I will probably not give a second chance , they were soggy and gummy (I waited 40 minutes for this?!?). The onion rings, however were great. As I said I will go back and give them a second chance, because I cannot believe that Station Casinos and GVR is proud of this place as it was when I went there. I hope it was just an off day. Live It Up You Are In Las Vegas For Cryin' Out Loud!"}
{"text":"Turf Grill is the deli of Green Valley Ranch. In similar fashion to the majority of casinos,it is located near the sports book. It is a similar setting to a fast food restaurant. You tell the cashier your order when you pay. The menu is on the wall to the right of the line. A few minutes later when the food is done,  the cook will call out your name. There is sufficient seating to eat this food.   The best way of putting it nicely, is that I probably would of passed on having dinner at Turf Grill if I wasn't sobering up after happy hour at the nearby Al's Garage. Turf Grill is just A-OK. If I was sober I probably would of gotten a lot more for my money at an off-casino restaurant.     I was unimpressed with the BLT with fries and Pepsi that I paid $8.10 for. Far from being terrible, it was ordinary at best. The fries were not tasty and the BLT was just eatable. To yelp it nicely, I have had far better BLTs. The Pepsi was served in a plain cup that was smaller than what I was used to.    I was impressed by the friendliness of the women who took my order. They greeted me with a smile and left me with a lasting nice impression of customer service, when one of them went up to my table and refilled my cup.    In the future, if I have a couple of beers at Al's Garage, I could see myself eating at this A-OK establishment. The food is not the best, however, It is a far better choice than driving buzzed.  ***The Daniel. S 2013 Yelp 200 Challenge.  Review 108***"}
{"text":"I've tried this place 3 times now. I really want to like it, but sadly I can't. It's overpriced, the burgers are very bland when they're undercooked... the fries are usually cold when they get served to us...   When I ask for a burger done medium, please do not hand me something that's bleu rare and dripping blood. I don't know where your meat comes from, so I'm not comfortable eating it mostly raw.   The first time I came here, was pretty decent, but nothing special really.   The second time we went and this happened, I didn't complain. I just ate the burger and bitched about it at home because I was unhappy with it. I had only come back because I had a coupon for buy one get one free on the burgers.   The third, and now final time I'll be going here... When I show it you my burger, and point out how it's dripping blood out one end, please do not say \"Well you ASKED for medium. That's medium to ME.\".   It's pretty bad when the woman taking orders even says afterwards \"That's why I was kind of suggesting well done. He doesn't know how to make it medium without it being extremely rare.\"   When the burger was remade the way I originally asked for it, it was much better and had a better flavor to it too, but by that point my bf was already done eating and waiting for me to get my food and finish it so we could go.   It's really sad because I can't find a place that does chicken strips properly around here either, and you do have decent strips, but you've also now stopped carrying blue cheese, so I have to go to the next restaurant over to get it... But alas, it's much less hassle and much less wait to just get my food elsewhere. I could get the same quality from a different place for much cheaper, and just avoid Green Valley Ranch all together."}
{"text":"Awesome place to eat before a movie. Their burgers and ribs are surprisingly good and they have a great variety of hamburgers to choose from. You can even build your own! The ribs are very tender and moist and the best part of all, they are only seven dollars!   Come and try this place which is all the way to the back in the casino by the sports book."}
{"text":"Worst service ever! I stood in line forever and no one was in front of me.  There was only one person at the restaurant and that same person was taking orders and cooking. After almost 8 minutes of standing there the employee (Daisy)  finally stated she would be right there to take my order. I was on my lunch and in a hurry I had no other place to go. I felt that this is managements fault, why would you only place one person in a busy casino restaurant.  Bad service and poorly run establishment."}
