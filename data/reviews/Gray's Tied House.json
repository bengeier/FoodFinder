{"text":"We went here to see a band and ended up wanting some dinner as well.  I would say the food was fine.  The beer was really good.  We had some cheese curds for an appetizer and they were good except they were way too salty.  I had the pesto chicken and it was good.  It wasn't really any different than what I might make at home, though.    Our server was really friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"The service at this place is so brutal. I don't get how anyone can stand eating here. We have tried it 3 times now, and they have officially struck out. Will never be back. It blows my mind that people tolerate this kind of service when there are so MANY better places in the Madison area."}
{"text":"Noisy. Food was average. Typical American \"bar\" fare. I think people go here more for the Gray's Ales, which are terrific. However, I was not impressed with their ginger beer; too bland. I had the Reuben and it was a large portion, but not spectacular. Not sure I'd make a point to eat here in the future, but might consider it."}
{"text":"Summary - mediocre fish fry; some ok microbrews; decent service  My husband, myself, and our 2 1/2 year old stopped in for dinner. First up, the drinks. My husband had the triple abbey ale. It was very good with a nice. light, fruity finish. I had their pumpkin ale. The glass was rimmed with a 'special spice blend' which had me concerned right away. A good beer doesn't need a garnished rim unless it does something to enhance the flavor. I'm pretty certain the spice blend (brown sugar and some spices) was designed to mask the blandness of the brew. It tasted very watery and bland. Not much flavor, much less pumpkin. It tasted like  Miller Lite with darker food coloring and a sugar rim.   Next, the food. My husband and I both opted for the Friday fish fry and chose baked cod. I chose a baked potato and my husband their cheesy hashbrowns. Our son had mini hotdogs with applesauce from the kids menu. Both my husband's and my fish was overcooked, bland, and rubbery. The slaw was standard fare with some dried cranberries thrown in. I took one bite and ate no more.My baked potato was lukewarm at best and the combination of gummy and dry that comes from sitting in a heating pan for too long. My husbands cheesy hashbrowns were underdone hashbrowns mixed with cheese and nothing else. There was no flavor to them at all. My son's hotdogs were lukewarm and the buns were pretty dry. We did like the fact there were 2 small hot dogs there, though.   We were able to be seated right away when we arrived, even though they were busy. One of the hostesses stopped at our table to take our drink order and let us know our server was busy changing a keg and would be right with us. Once we ordered our drinks, our waiter was back to deliver them shortly after and took our order. Our food did not take long to arrive at table, either. Although, i would have rather waited longer for better/fresher food.   I'd be willing to go back one more time and try something off the regular menu. But definitely skip the Friday Fish Fry. Also, I'll probably ask to try a beer before I order a full serving next time."}
{"text":"We used Gray's Tide House as our wedding caterer. We could not be more pleased with how things went and how amazing the food was. The staff were super professional, excused tables quickly, replenished food quickly, cleared plates, etc. And the food was amazing (and hot!). We had pulled pork, beef brisket, loaded mashed potatoes, glazed carrots, and green beans. We have received countless comments from our guests on how wonderful the food was, including many saying it is the best food they have ever had at a wedding, hands down (I agree)!  Seriously do not have one piece of negative feedback regarding the service they provided and would recommend them over and over again for any event that needs catering. They made the food portion of our wedding seamless and we are super thankful about that!"}
{"text":"Had 2 for 1 burger special on Mondays.  Burgers were really fresh.  Plenty of variety and toppings were generous.  The cheese curds, with a lighter beer batter, were also excellent.  They don't have the largest tap selection and we only ordered the porter, which also was good.  The service was slower than usual, but they told us that when we ordered (not sure if there was something wrong in the kitchen or what), and it wasn't a big deal.  Atmosphere similar to the Dane except slightly more relaxed."}
{"text":"The very best cheese curds I have eaten in my life!  Perfect crunch from the beer Bastet accompanied by the gooey wonder of warm cheese curds!  My spouse said the brisket sandwich with scrambled eggs was delicious.  We saw it when we stopped for gas and recognized the Grays name from our hometown of Janesville, WI.  It seems to be one of those hidden gems.  Win for us.  It will be a win for you. I also had the Bully Porter... Great."}
{"text":"Gray's Tied House is what you could call Verona's version of The Great Dane, just not quite as good. The beer selection and cocktails definitely meet expectations and the food selection is extensive. The only issue with having such a wide menu is that it's hard to do everything well and as a result, the food is just average. I always have a good time at Gray's but always wish the food was better; maybe stick with burgers if you make your way out here."}
{"text":"Every meal here has to be tried at least once. Amazing burgers. Different specials everyday. Great service. Amazing beer and oh my word, those kettle chips with that dipping sauce."}
{"text":"Food is only average. Atmosphere very suburban mall-ish. If you usually eat at chain restaurants, you will probably be satisfied. If you have higher standards, don't bother unless circumstances (proximity, the preferences of your dining companions, etc) dictate that this is your only choice."}
{"text":"The only reason I am being nice enough to give 2 stars is because the cheesecurds were pretty good.   We will start from the beginning. We were seated pretty quickly, then quickly followed by our drink and appetizer orders.   We ordered cheese curds and pretzel bites.    The curds were really great.  The pretzel bites were okay.  It came with 2 dips. Jalapeño cheddar and \"honey mustard\".   The Jalapeño cheddar tasted like it came from a jar, and the honey mustard was all horseradish.   Gross if you don't like it or are not expecting it. (The description said nothing about horseradish). For the main dish, we ordered Grey's burger and shrimp fettuccine.  The burger was great, as well as the fries.  I took one bite of my brown lukewarm fettuccine before placing it at the edge of the table.   (I've never sent anything back before) When the waitress FINALLY came to check on us, my boyfriend had finished his meal, so I was not interested in getting a replacement dish.   I just asked for it to be taken off the check, and to recieve the check.  The waitress was very nice about it.     Then it got really bad.   It took almost a half an hour from the time of asking for our check before we got to leave.   They were not busy. Maybe 8 or 9 tables there, and at least 4 or 5 waitstaff.  We had to ask the front for our bill again.    Our waitress would not come out to us after she knew we were upset, so someone else had to.    We weren't even that upset until our waitress just ditched us cause something went wrong.    Other waitstaff seemed friendly at least, but a bad first impression, so we won't be back."}
{"text":"THE BEST DEEP FRIED CHEESE CURDS YOU WILL EVER HAVE.   If you've ever had deep fried cheese curds, you know that they can be heavy and greasy. To a certain extent you expect that. These are not that in the most refreshing way. First off, their cheese curds are clearly high quality and fresh. If you are from Wisconsin you know that fresh cheese curds are squeaky and moist (and you can tell that regardless of if they are cold or fried). Older cheese curds are dense and overly chewy. The beer batter really allows the cheese to take center stage. It is light and airy and flavorful. You truly taste the cheese in a deep fried treat that doesn't make you feel like you have a brick in your stomach afterwards.  Their beer selection is solid and will appeal to all tastes. A great variety of pints on tap."}
{"text":"My wife got the house burger and sweet potato fries with a strawberry soda. Althought things tasted good the way I characterize the burger is that it was one toned, not bland, there was just no development of flavors. No layers... if you know what I mean then great!  I got the italian sausage and beef sandwhich. I think they did a good job but I just do not like the italian sausage taste, no matter how many times I've tried it. So thats on me.  They use yellow chedder cheese curds which are too oily imo.  Rotbeer was pretty good thought the strawberry soda thy make was even better.  I think I would come back to see what else they have to offer.  Also the place is really nice, I felt like I was eating in large club house with a fish tank!"}
{"text":"Visited the Tied House on Superbowl Sunday, only to realize that our party were the only customers in the place who weren't friends of the owner.  As a result, a server came by perhaps three times, and we could never tell if the staff were working or were there to drink.  Food-wise, standard but good brew-pub food, very good beers, including the amber ale and stout.  Warning: smoking is allowed in the restaurant."}
{"text":"This place has awesome food and great craft beer and very friendly staff. Come see for yourself."}
{"text":"Tried Gray's for lunch yesterday. The service was great, nice waiter, attentive but not pushy. The food was okay. We had the burger of the month, the poutine burger. It was a little confused with onion rings, a few over cooked cheese curds and a crazy amount of gravy. The kettle chips were okay as well but the sauce needed something.  I had water and my partner had root beer, he received a refill which was great. With the tip it was 35$ for two people. When I asked how he liked it, he said it was decent. It was too expensive to just be decent."}
{"text":"Stay away from this place!  The service is atrocious if they condescend to appear at your table.  So don't be surprised if it takes twice as long as a meal normally should because the waitstaff never returns to your table.  The food is decent but very overpriced for what you get.  Burgers are OK.  Their more restaurant-like entrees are feeble if not down-right bad.  The salads are fresh but the salad dressings are hideous.  Atmosphere is decent. If you decide to go, bring cash.  Our waitress took liberties with our credit card.  And the owners seem to like to complain and get bad reviews filtered..."}
{"text":"Horrible... Food very poor low quality frozen grade.  Service is poor... too bad...with some great management...this could be an absolute gold mine...  Male bartenders more concerned with impressing female patrons and regulars...also... they are smart@#$ beer snobs...  be prepared to be sneered at if your not sure which kind to order.  Like I said...could be a gold mine ...facility is beautiful...has HUGE potential."}
{"text":"We have been in Verona for about a year now.  We have brought our children here and liked the food.  Recently we are remodeling our kitchen and eat here about once a week.  We happen to like sitting near the bar area for our kids to watch the fish and we can watch the Brewer game. We do not sit at the bar and our children are fairly well mannered. Tonight we were asked to leave the bar area and our children would be best seated somewhere else. Very disappointed in our service this evening."}
{"text":"Gray's is our go to family restaurant in Verona. They have a great menu, warm atmosphere, extensive beer selection, and friendly staff.  Favorite appetizer is easily their cheese curds. These are in the running for best I've had in the Madison area.  Best night to visit in my opinion is Friday. They've got a good selection for a classic Wisconsin fish fry."}
{"text":"The reviews for Gray's Tied House aren't stellar, so I was a bit worried when we stopped here for lunch on Sunday, June 8th. Our experience was fantastic!  We arrived and were immediately impressed by the lovely appearance of the interior of Gray's. It is large and has nice high ceilings. Maybe it's a bit rustic as well, but the look works. We were greeted and seated very promptly.   Our waiter was super friendly without being intrusive. Another plus: my husband requested that the TV right by our table be switched to the Brewer's game and it was done immediately. No hassle, and none of that nonsense that seems to happen so often at bars where servers don't know how to operate the TV remote. This guy knew what he was doing!  The menu at Gray's offers fare similar to many other upscale Brewpub-type places in the area. This genre has been done to death in the Madison area, but Gray's executed it very well, which personally, I value over creativity any day.  We shared an appetizer of buffalo wings. We got 10 wings for ~$7.50, which seemed like a good deal. The wings come with homemade ranch dressing for dipping. (The dressing was excellent, but I would have preferred blue cheese.) They nailed the classic buffalo wing at Gray's: no breading, deep fried to a crisp, and generously coated in a sauce of Frank's and butter. Simple and lovely.   My husband got a soup and salad combo and remarked that his soup, a beer-cheese-brat creation, was super yummy. He also enjoyed his Caesar salad.   I got Gray's Cobb salad, which rated very highly among Cobb salads that I've had in the area. I chose Gray's (homemade) Blue Cheese dressing with my salad, and found it to be amazingly delicious! I also appreciated that amount of \"stuff\" that came on my salad. The salad was priced at about $10, which seemed standard, but there was very little \"filler\", and the salad was resplendent with nummy smoked turkey, a whole hard-boiled egg, at least half an avocado, and lots of blue cheese and bacon. I felt like the salad was a good value, and I didn't come close to finishing it. I had the leftover Cobb salad for dinner that night too, but I didn't mind because it was just so darn tasty.  I hope to come back again soon and try some of Gray's beer!"}
{"text":"It's really not as bad as it's made out to be by some.  I know, faint praise, but overall it's a good addition to the Verona area.  The Pub Club is actually really good, at $7.95 with fries, not overpriced.  Burgers are a little high for what they are- $9.95 for a bacon cheeseburger is ambitious, but not quite outrageous.  Service at the bar is fine, the crowd is light when I've been there.  Plenty of TV's if that's your thing."}
{"text":"Went here with the family a few nights ago.  We were warmly greeted and shown to our seats right away which I thought was great since the parking lot was jammed.  Our drink order came out quickly and we put in our order.  Food came fast and we got down to business.  My wife got a burger with a side of cheesy potatoes.  Problem was they were Luke warm.  The waitress to her credit, got some new hot potatoes for her right away.  The burger itself was good, but not memorable.  I got a pulled pork sandwich w/ fries.  The BBQ sauce was good, but not very favorable.  Fries were great and plentiful.  Daughter got Mac and cheese which she declared just OK.  We have been here several times, but this time it was just OK."}
{"text":"My family and myself have been to Gray's quite a few times. It's close to our house and the food is almost always SO delicious. During the winter we found they kept the restaurant too cold. Winter's in the Midwest are cold and having to keep your coat on throughout dinner is kind of annoying. But since the servers are always nice and the food is good, we continue to go back.  Tonight my mom, dad, brother, and myself headed to Gray's for dinner. As soon as we got in we realized how hot it was inside. But with the heat wave recently, we figured it'd be worse outside. So we stayed inside and expressed our concern with the heat. A server brushed off our concerns and said it was because of how close to the kitchen we were...  We moved forward with our meal and waited long enough for our actual table's server to pick out what we wanted to eat. Our food took around seventeen minutes (which seems like a long time, especially since our server did not check back with us during that time). Our food was brought out by a runner. The food itself was delicious!! I had the blackened salmon sandwich with sweet potato fries. I ate pretty much everything on my plate.  Our server checked back with us ONCE. All of our drinks were empty and we were never offered for refills. After our meal our server brought us a box for leftovers and....then did not come back with our ticket. After waiting at least ten minutes with no drinks and being done with our food, my brother took our card TO HER so we could leave. She brought back the ticket to sign and half heartily said sorry and excused her lack of service for being busy with other tables outside.  Overall, we all felt the experience was terrible. We felt ignored and because of the temperature inside, it was so uncomfortable. We're unsure if it'd ever go back"}
{"text":"Food is good. Their brewed beer is not great. Service is awful. Been here about 5 times within the last 2 months (we just moved here).   FOOD: Good burgers and sandwiches. Great appetizers, especially the cheese curds and beerachos.  DRINKS: Their own beer is only okay, but they carry a wide selection of others, including many craft beers and a full bar.   ATMOSPHERE: Wonderful. It's a beautiful restaurant, great outdoor dining, really nice bar area, and an upstairs for private parties and whatnot.   SERVICE: This is their big problem. I can only really speak for the bartender and bar servers. But we have had bad experiences on almost all occasions. I won't go into details, but you aren't greeted timely, drinks go empty, and they aren't friendly - by any means. The only good service was when we dined on the patio, but we could see the bartender and servers eating food behind the bar through the window. Ugh.  All-in-all, if it wasn't for the poor service and waitstaff, we would be here often. But I'm contemplating even going again."}
{"text":"Mediocre ordered a medium rare ribeye got medium at best steak.    This place takes No pride in delivering great food.   Last time will not return"}
{"text":"I ate here with my mother, husband and 2 year old.  It was ok.  Service was not good.  Took longer than most places to place order, no one came to check on us, provided only partial components of the kid's meal (and shame on Gray's for offering only fountain drinks on the kids' menu; also fries come with some kids meals but applesauce only with others) and slow appearance to clear and give check.  Also did not offer a box for more than half the food on the plate (which wasn't really a loss since the mac and cheese was a glob of box-looking M/C).  I had the chicken pesto sandwich, which was fine, but nothing unique.  What I really liked was the selection of their sodas and surprised that they had diet root beer and diet cream soda.  I wish they would serve with a glass though.  I would go back since it's probably the best thing going in Verona."}
{"text":"My husband and I were here last night and we thought our mushroom burger and taco pizza were both tepid and mediocre-tasting. We waited 30 minutes for this food and the place wasn't even busy at the time we ordered it, which was 5 pm. The great beer and friendly bartenders saved the night, though.  On two other occasions, we had the pulled pork sandwich and the buffalo chicken wrap.  Both were not good.  We also both watched members of the Electric Blue band bully Brandon Beebe into ending his set early so they could set up their eleven tons of unnecessary equipment. We stayed for one Electric Blue song and didn't care to hear more.   Honestly, the place is good for a beer and to watch sports on the big screens but that's about it.  The facility is nice but I'm really surprised that the food continues to be bad."}
{"text":"The food is terrible. Nachos are not difficult to make and when they are horribly made that's when you know the cooks cannot even work a microwave. Our server, Angel, was also very very inpatient and did not checkup on our table until we were still eating our entrees to bring us the bill. The seating in the dining area is also atrociously set and the booths are uncomfortable. I would personally recommend going anywhere else for lunch."}
{"text":"I love that I live just down the road from this place.  Our in-laws took us to lunch here and we all left happy and full.  I got the Mac & Jack Burger.  I could eat one of those at least once a week.  It was huge and had a lot of tasty things on it. Definite pro that sweet potato fries were not extra.  I couldn't finish it all, but it made for great leftovers. I left with a 4-pack of Ginger Beer. A lot of ginger flavor, would taste great in a Moscow Mule!"}
{"text":"Food was pretty blah, in fact, disappointing. The staff was friendly and the outdoor seating is great, however. Won't likely be returning because of the food alone, which is too bad. Was hoping it would be our place to go to often since it's in our neighborhood. If the food was good, or even better, we'd be willing to spend the $50 for a bite to eat."}
{"text":"Every time I go to Gray's I am disappointed. I have a lot of friends who love this place, and I end up there once every couple of months, to my chagrin. Their own beer is so-so. I have always liked other beers they have on tap, so at least they have another option. They never have any kind of specials, and when they do, it is something dumb like pull tabs. The bartenders usually seem like we are bothering them because they are understaffed if it is busy. If it is not busy, they act bored and want to go home, like the customers are forcing them to stay.  Their food is supremely disappointing, especially if you are a vegetarian. A server told me their cook literally refuses to have a veggie burger option, so if you want anything other than a plate of greasy carby appetizers, you will be sad. They only have one vegetarian sandwich.  All the salads come with meat. Their apps are also kind of dumb, the bruschetta is a huge rip-off, it tastes alright but you get about 5 little bites of food for $6. Over a dollar per tiny piece of bread! Every time we try something it is like I check it off the list of things I'll never eat again.  I am giving 2 stars because the one time I ate sit-down dinner the waitress was really nice and attentive on a busy Sunday afternoon. The cheese curds are at least sizable and good and they have other brewery's beers that are actually good on tap to save me when I am forced to join a group there. I never go because I want to."}
{"text":"Torn between three and four stars.  Generally the service is pretty good and and the food is decent.  This place is pretty good but not overly inspiring."}
{"text":"This is my fiance and my third time here.  The bar serves great drinks and they have their own beer they serve which the lady would rate at 3.7/5.  I haven't had beer since my first appearance because I've been happy with the mix drinks.  Now the food.  Tonight we got the jalapeno infused fried cheese curds.  They were simply amazing, melt in your mouth.  She got the southwestern steak salad.  The steak was perfectly cooked, but the rest of the salad was meh.  I got the Mack and Jack burger, which is essentially a burger with 2 fried macaroni bites and pepper jack cheese on it, as well as chipotle mayo.  I was surprised how bland this sandwich was.  I wouldn't order it again just because it didn't have much for taste.  In our 3 visits here we consistently get good bar service, but the food quality has ranged from mediocre to good.  We had a very attentive waiter and service overall"}
{"text":"Had a burger.  Made just the way I asked for it and served very nicely.  Burger prices are good (and tasty!)...the rest of the menu could come down on price a bit.  Would definitely go again and try something else...maybe one of their other burger versions (???)"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and had a pretty enjoyable experience. Service was good, although it wasn't very busy so that's expected. The building is also beautiful and very, very large.   I had the Tied House Burger with sweet potato fries. The burger was good and cooked perfectly. The fries were yummy too, however it was obvious that they had been frozen. The dipping sauce they come with is amazing though. Other people I was with had the pizza and salad combo, a salad (can't remember which one) and a panini with apples and bacon. They all enjoyed their meals as well.  I'd definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Food is standard service is great, nothin to brag about, but it was a reasonable price and good brews"}
{"text":"We had a larger group, they were prepared for arrival and our server quickly took our drink and appetizer order. The appetizers came out quickly, the fried cheese curds were still fresh and squeaked. The salads were crisp and fresh and we were given the choice of 13 dressings. The entrees for our group came out rapidly and were all exactly as each person ordered. I would definitely recommend Gray's Tide House."}
{"text":"My favorite thing here, ok I lied. 2 favorite things:  1: They bring you giant drinks out on the patio.  Staff is usually friendly, remember me and make excellent Vodka Presses.  Ask for extra lemon!  2. I love the Ahi Tuna salad.  The cucumber \"spaghetti\" with wasabi dressing is delicious.  I order it every time.   If you don't want a vodka drink and Japanese salad there are other choices. I've had a variety of other salads, burgers, sandwiches, etc. I think their cuisine has improved over the years.   The outside patio has a big pond with a fountain.  It's nice. Perfect for large groups, tons of space, 2 separate areas that can be rented out for private meetings or parties. Own parking lot. 14 minutes from downtown or 5 minutes from EPIC."}
{"text":"Cute place, but food was so, so. I got the Pacific Rim chicken salad. It looked yummy, bit the chicken was tough. Also, the dressing was a ginger peanut soy sauce mix, and was REALLY HOT!! The red beer was very good, though!!! Overall, beer good, food blah! Also, took staff forever to clean up a big group table after people were gone.  Had to look at the mess for at least a half hour. Hum? Wonder were the manager was hanging out to not notice!! Think a new manager is needed!!!"}
{"text":"I recently scheduled two private parties here and both were huge successes.  The first one was a small intimate get together to celebrate my daughter's college graduation and the staff was tremendous.  They rocked it and made my daughter's day.    The second one was a company party and from the moment I walked in when I saw one of my favorite bartender's (Heidi) hand stuffing my bleu cheese stuffed olives for my martinis, I knew it was going to be another home run.  The food was fantastic and the service was out of this world.    It's all good..."}
{"text":"Their Reuben sandwich is still awesome!  Try Potosi's Tangerine IPA!!"}
{"text":"We were driving down 151 past Verona and decided we needed some lunch.  Gray's Tied House came up on the GPS and I'm so glad it did.  I thought this place was great.  First the atmosphere.  It's a new modern looking building.  Very bright and spacious.  Multiple dining areas.  High tops around the wood fired oven.  Large bar area.  Lot of booths and tables.  A huge aquarium w/lots of tropical fish.  Outdoor areas and more private areas.  It really has space for every need.  The service was also fine.  We were greeted at the door and led to a booth next to the aquarium.  Our waitress was polite and prompt.  She took our order, brought us our food, and answered questions efficiently.  I also really like that they brew their own.  Both beer AND soda.  I had the porter which was delicious - chocolatey and nutty.  For sodas, they have orange, cream and root beer.  Finally the food.  There were several things I really liked about the food.  I ordered the Black 'N Blue Burger which was perfectly cooked and delicious.  But what I loved most about it was the choice of sides: French Fries, Sweet Potato Fries, Kettle Chips or Dipping Vegetables.  When do you ever see Dipping Vegetables for a side?  The day we were there the dipping vegetables were carrots and broccoli and it was a huge amount of vegetables.  I don't like Ranch but I was able to get them with a side of Blue Cheese. I was very pleased with the options, the amount, the freshness, the ability to substitute, and the price.  It was a really great experience at Grays' Tied House and I look forward to returning."}
{"text":"Gray's has become a family favorite! We found it when looking for a place to throw a bridal shower for family travel form different corners of the state. I checked it out with my family before we booked to make sure we liked the food.  Eating there as a family we all found things we liked, especially the kids and the funnel fries. They are like funnel cakes, only in the size of French fries...so good. It passed the test.  Setting up the shower was easy and the day of everyone was really impressed. The room had a great set up and the food was a hit. My husband and the groom really enjoyed it, seeing as it was a Saturday during a Badger game and they hung out at the bar. Apparently there was a great drink deal during the game that they both enjoyed:)  The service has always been good. Definitely a place we recommend and will go back to."}
{"text":"Totally ups and downs with this place. After a few year hiatus we went back and were pleasantly surprised, so went back 6-8 times. They seem to be on a \"down\" with recent menu changes. Food is OK. Drinks are good when orders are accurate. Patio is great when it's nice out. Indoor searing feels a bit like a loud warehouse unless you're in a booth near the doors to the kitchen."}
{"text":"We always enjoy this place. Not only is it local and close for us , but it's so clean & neat with great outdoor seating. Great selection of good and have never been disappointed. I don't drink but they have their own brews & wine coolers that everyone I've spoken to loves them very much. I like the atmosphere & the food the best. If you are having their burgers, there are plenty to choose from & big ones at that ! I Love their Tex Mex One and be prepared for a huge one that I can never finish!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times before, burgers and sandwiches, which I remember enjoying.  This particular time we came for Friday fish fry. Curds were delicious. I ordered the regular fish fry with a cup of the clam chowder and my fiancé ordered the walleye.  My fish was fantastic. Lightly breaded and perfectly seasoned. And I'm still having dreams about the clam chowder. Probably the best I've ever had, which should not be taken lightly. I opted for the garlic mashed potatoes as my side which were a bit on the dry side, but still had good flavor.  The walleye, however, was a different story. The piece of fish was huge but after the first few bites, my fiancé found so many large bones he was completely turned off and couldn't eat anymore.  We will definitely be back again, we just won't order the walleye."}
{"text":"We planned my parents Surprise 60th Birthday party at Gray's and couldn't have been happier with how the evening turned out. Nicki is a big help in planning, estimating food portions and offering suggestions for drink packages. The space itself is great. Very wide open for guests to socialize, sit and eat/drink. Because it was a surprise the staircase led to a great way to have all guests stand to shout Surprise as my parents entered Grays! The staff was very friendly and accommodating throughout the whole night. I'd highly recommend Gray's to host parties!!"}
{"text":"Good food, american pub. Great, friendly waitstaff, fun to have their own branded beer on tap. Great for a group of people to hang out. Better than any chain like Fridays.  Laid back atmosphere."}
{"text":"Really good fish fry.  Perfectly fried with just enough grease to be good and not enough to be gross.  Flaky fish, Tasty Tartar.  Beer battered fries that are so so good.   Service was only okay but generally a good experience."}
{"text":"The atmosphere may be what you'd expect of a bar in the middle of a suburban development, but the food and drink are pretty good.   Our friends love their beer, we gushed over their root beer. The malted berry drink was perfect for lightweights.   The Wisco Porker pizza was tasty and full of meat - just as you would want and expect.   Nice bonus - Free shots after touchdowns during Badger games. Woop!"}
{"text":"I really want to like this place since I live in the neighborhood and can easily walk. I've been coming here since it opened and only had decent food once. Bar apps and drinks are great (if you're sitting at the bar), but beyond that the price/quality/service are way out of alignment.   Currently sitting here for breakfast on Ironman morning. Breakfast buffet just opened, so you think it would be great, right? (BTW- it's not busy at the moment.)  Eggs- clearly powdered eggs that weren't mixed well and are gritty. GRITTY eggs!  Cold hash browns. Not mildly warm- straight up cold. Crappy biscuits and gravy. The only good thing on the buffet is the cut up fresh fruit and dried granola."}
{"text":"Very similar to the great dane. Love the beers, grays honey ale is an old favorite and the porter is delicious."}
{"text":"Enjoying the latest release at Gray's. Raspberry honey wheat beer. Cool, crisp and refreshing. Perfect summer beer! Come and get one .....or two!"}
{"text":"Ordered a Moscow mule to start which was fantastic with a mix of their home made Belfast Ginger Beer.   For a second I had to try their home made beer but it doesn't taste much different than a mug root beer."}
{"text":"Been going here for trivias lately and hope to into the future.  Food is GREAT and CHEAP! Tap brewed beer is $2 DURING trivia. I did not mistype that - 2 freaking dollars. It had the first pumpkin ale I've EVER liked(didn't expect that) and great IPAs. Great place for trivia and $2 beer! The pretzel appetizer+tap beer on a budget price but amazing taste ! Will be going here a lot for trivia!"}
{"text":"Foolish E. Who goes to a tied house for a cocktail? Or for decent food? Do you want a beer? Then go here.  Do you want anything more than a beer? Then don't."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night at 8 and was able to sit right away. Although we didn't try any of their home brew we enjoyed some cocktails and they were delicious. Great menu of variety. I had the Mac and jack burger. A burger with 2 deep fried mac n cheese bites with pepper jack cheese on top. Delicious. Fries weren't the very best, but others may enjoy them. I will definitely go here and order the Mac n jack burger again."}
{"text":"It's been a while since visiting,  but Yelp asked for my opinion.  The menu was pretty unimaginative so I got a burger.  Basic burger but way over priced for something so average.  Another time I had the nachos.  Nothing spectacular here either.  I did enjoy the oatmeal stout on my first visit.  But they were out of it the next time.  Whatever it was I settled on that time wasn't very remarkable or I would have remembered it. I was disappointed,  I had been hoping for a good \"go to \" place in town.  And so continues the quest."}
{"text":"As we were finishing our business dinner my colleague said well we are 2 for 2 for dinner, this was great.  Our clients recommended that we meet for dinner at Gray's as it was casual and close to our hotel.  Gray's is indeed casual, but fine for date, family, or couple of drinks at the bar night. Their menu states that they local source a lot of their ingredients. And the statement that they have fresh fish available caught my eye.  We ordered some local brews and their heart attack appetizer, the fried brats, and cheese, with the bacon jalapeno sauce. Yea it was worth it, spend an extra 20 minutes on the treadmill or take the extra Zuma class if you feel guilty.  Our entrees included fish and chips, salmon, and their rib eye steak. All were AOK. Everyone who ordered the garlic mashed potatoes said they were excellent.  Lastly service was  spot on and friendly."}
{"text":"I've been to Gary's Tied House a few times now - 4 I think, maybe 5. I really like this place. Now I haven't sat at the bar for a game, or gone out on the patio for drinks. My experience has been mainly coming here for dining only.  Each time I was here I think I've tried something different. I've been happy every time. The prices are a touch high, but the portions are good and the quality too - and those are just as if not more important.   When I was there last Sunday, I tried the Beef Brisket Grinder sandwich with chips. Beef Brisket with Scrambled eggs and chips and cheese sauce on a French Roll. Sounded too good to pass up. It really was quite awesome. My wife had the Pacific Rim Salad. She liked it a lot, although it was a bit spicy - but she knew that from the menu description. I can't recall the other menu items I've tried before, besides knowing that I've tried a burger. All have been quite well prepared and above your average pub food. Compliments have been unusual including this odd sauce that comes with their chips - super yummy but i have no idea what it is.   A few times we have come on a Friday or a weekend, and its been a bit busy. But they are doing things right so I guess that to be expected. Not sure why I'm not giving them 5 stars - I guess I've only had a few of their beers and haven't tried the patio or anything. We'll give a few more tries and see if they can earn the fifth one. : )"}
{"text":"I love it here. Tons of options, and great microbrews (if that's your thing.)  Favorites include the cheese curds, grilled fish tacos, and sweet potato fries (they come with some kind of mustard that is amazing).  I've always had friendly, prompt service."}
{"text":"Try the funnel fries. So good! Cozy atmosphere. The beer is from their own brewery, so it's definitely worth a try! Delicious."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice now and both times were enjoyable.  The first night I had the fried cheese curds appetizer (see pic), and it was very tasty.  My only complaint was the saltiness became a little overwhelming.  The spinach artichoke pasta was good but blander than I expected.  The Rathskeller Amber beer was excellent!  The second night I had the spinach artichoke dip (see pic) and it was very creamy and warming.  Had the Sirloin and it was juicy, tender, and cooked to perfection.  Overall, great atmosphere, excellent service, and good food."}
{"text":"The Busted Knuckle Irish Ale and the stone fired pizza make this a worthwhile destination. Only reason I didn't rate it higher is I've only tried two different dishes and they've both been pizza, so I can't speak to the rest of the menu. The onion rings though are most excellent too!"}
{"text":"We used to come here often, but after a bad taste was left in our mouth we avoided it for a while. We 're gently returned and just must say it's great. The menu has slightly changed and service was excellent. Had the salmon sandwich and it was awesome. The salmon filet was huge and very juicy(I'm always afraid it's going to dry). It was topped with some sort of dill aioli that really makes the sandwich. We will happily return!"}
{"text":"Went there a couple weeks ago.  Based on the other reviews they must of been having a off night.   Had a order of cheese curds for a appraiser .  In my opinion the could of used some more time in the fryer.   They were very mushy.  My Adult Son and I each had the fish fry.   His broiled and mine deep fried.   My son's was swimming in grease.   My order of fish was as mushy as the cheese curds.   I did manage to get a soda refill after a prolonged wait.   For a Friday night there were plenty of empty tables. Would not go back."}
{"text":"First timer. Came on a Saturday night. The place was busy but the service was top notch. The waitress didn't rush us but the food came out quickly once we ordered. Everything was delicious. The cheese curds and the fish tacos were amazing. We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Great burgers, nice atmosphere. The beer is only so so but Gray's is really worth checking out. Ask for \"campfire sauce\" for your fries."}
{"text":"Great selection of draft beers.  Grays Oatmeal Stout was delicious and creamy.  The Raspberry Honey Wheat is refreshingly different and excellent on a 91 degree day in Wisconsin!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great atmosphere - sports bar but with just the right amount of class. Great house beers, friendly serving staff, amazing drunk food. A fun place to go with friends ir family + an adventuruous take on the traditional bar menu"}
{"text":"I've been to Gray's Tied House several times and they have never disappointed. Their cheese curds are amazing, and they have their own micro-brews aka the pure definition of any good wisconsin pub.  Every thing I have eaten here from several of their appetizers, to sandwiches, pizza, and entree meals has been fantastic.  The one thing that all of our friends and family love are the burgers!  They are cooked in some magical way that makes them the most delicious burgers of all time.  My family drives a few hours just to eat them!  Overall best place to eat!"}
{"text":"I live in walking distance but I still skip it due to the poor service. They have plenty of staff but they are unsupervised and not very attentive. I had two visits in a row where I was seated and forgotten. I usually have to walk to the bar to get service. The food is fine if you can get the staff to serve it. One final note they do not take discover if that is your card of choice."}
{"text":"Good service and food, decent price. Nice place to just come with friend and family to just hangout and grab a drink."}
{"text":"Just OK food and service. They seem to be trying but food is just so so and space needs a little refurbishment."}
{"text":"Yeah, this place has officially hit rock bottom. A friend invited me to dinner, so I thought, hmm why not? I will try this place again.  So first, our server, Shawn, was nice. Not very attentive but he seemed busy.  We ordered the cheese curds and fried pickles. The pickles were some of the best I had had. The cheese curds were average.   I then ordered the beef medallions. It came with a salad. The salad before the meal was the high point. The medallions should have been cooked medium. I could not see how they were cooked because they were covered in cold congealed gravy. The meat was rubbery and overcooked. The gravy looks like it had been microwaves over and over several times. It was globby. Is that a word?  Because I can not think of another word. My mashed potatoes were cold. And in no way tasty or \"loaded\" as described.   I never send food back but I did this time. The GM Andrea brought it back to me. It was OBVIOUSLY just microwaved. She did nothing to say she was sorry that my food was cold. It was obviously prepared and sat under the lights for awhile.   I didn't finish it, I barely ate anything but the steamed vegetables and I was charged in full for my meal. It was awful. Andrea was so quick to leave that I did not get to tell her the beer I ordered was flat. The whole meal was gross."}
{"text":"Pizza was delicious!!   Puzzling decor. Beautiful architecture, warm cozy colors, exposed stone, hardwood, vaulted ceilings... Fish tanks... TVs everywhere? Is this a sports bar or a upscale restaurant?     Service was good. Nothing spectacular, she didn't offer after dinner drinks or dessert. I felt a little rushed as checks were dropped just after we received our dinner. (Great for lunch service, not great for a leisurely Saturday dinner.)   I would return but being from the east side, I wouldn't drive out of my way to go there again."}
{"text":"We came here around 7pm, and were seated right away. I ordered the beef medallions, and the boyfriend ordered the bbq ribs. The food was very mediocre. The bbq ribs were a wet sauce which is always a mistake. There was clearly no love or care taken to the ribs.  Similarly the beef medallions were low quality. Their entrees came with vegetables, a salad, and a choice of potato. The vegetables with the entree were overcooked, drowned in butter, and lacking in any other flavoring.   The service was also really poor. We waited a long time for our food and for our bill. Our waitress rarely came to check on us. The table next to see were seated after we ordered and they paid their bill before we could even get our waitress to come back so that we could ask for the bill. After she gave us the bill, it took another five minutes for her just to come back and collect our payment. I eventually gave up and went looking for her.  It was obnoxious.  Mediocre food, bad service, and a long drive out of town. I don't know how this place stays in business."}
{"text":"Going to start off by saying I was horribly disappointed with our waitress. We did come in on a busy night when the live band was starting so we knew we had to wait. However, we waited 15 minutes for our boxes and I saw her taking shots with other people at the bar. By all means, have fun at your job but get your work done first.  Now onto the food. We ordered the pretzel bites for an appetizer. They were really good but the dip needs to come with a warning!  The only other time I've had my nose burn like that was when I've put to much wasabi on sushi. My friend ordered a mushroom Swiss burger and it was overcooked but good. I ordered the Buffalo chicken pizza and it was really good."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my meal tonight. It was a tasty Panini with a couple of cheeses, Apple, the most amazing bacon and I added Avocado to it. The service was great, the patrons were nice and I felt comfortable there. They had a lot of choices when It came to their food and brews. I'm definitely come back."}
{"text":"We came here on reccomendation of a co-worker and because we had a coupon. The dinner started off badly because we didn't find out until we were seated that the daily special (2.50 taps) was only in the club bar. There were no signs showing that and our coupon said otherwise. Annoying, but we could handle it. Our server was prompt but very rude to the server she was training. We also got the vibe she was talking about us as she walked away or while watching our table, it was pretty uncomfortable. The food was ok, but not great. Had we had a better experience maybe we would have come back for something else, but I'd rather get a burger somewhere where the service is better."}
{"text":"Somewhere between 3 and 4 stars.  Nothing to write home about, but the beer is good and the food is decent.  All around a decent brew pub with reliably good food.  Verona is small, choices are few, so having a reliable place like this is nice."}
{"text":"My husband and I made our way out here for a quick date of appetizers and drinks.   The Reuben Rolls were good in concept. When they arrived at our table however, the egg roll wrappers were slightly burnt and rather flavorless. The reuben filling was OHkay, but nothing to write home about.  We shared a regular plate of nachos and found it perfect for two! The queso sauce used was fine by me!  I decided on a lavender drink I had found on the summer drinks menu (it was September, but I wasn't going to quibble.) Unfortunately upon the first sip I thought I'd been hit with the vodka bottle!   Overall, friendly service and good atmosphere. If it were my only option I would be back sooner, but in the meantime, my restaurant hunt continues."}
{"text":"Good beer, large menu."}
{"text":"Food was decent but we came for the 2-4-1 burger deal.  I confirmed with the waitress.  We ordered two burgers $11.99 each.  The bill took off $7.99.  I asked for an explanation and was told that the cheapest burger is $7.99 so that's what they discount.  Umm. There wasn't a burger on he menu under $10.99.  Her response \" it's not on the menu but it is available and that's the discount\".  False advertising anyone?  Will not be returning"}
{"text":"I want to give this place 3.5 stars, but it's not an option.. So just pretend. :-) Gray's is a really great place to hang out and the food is delicious. My only complaint is the serious lack of any healthy options. How 'bout adding a nice turkey burger or a veggie burger to the menu? I don't want to be stuck ordering a salad when I want watch my calories. However, on the days I'm not counting calories.. I'm in heaven with the food choices. The Mac and Cheese is my favorite but I've never ordered something that I didn't enjoy. Also! I had my bridal shower in the event room at GTH. The staff was so wonderful and accommodating.. It was truly a day I will never forget. Definitely consider using GTH for special events. My family will definitely keep returning to this great addition to Verona's bar and restaurant scene. It's definitely an improvement over the Oasis bar that stood in that spot 15 or so years ago (pre-Epic days)."}
{"text":"Killer deck.  Good food.  But a bad service night... This may have been a 5-star review if our service was even a bit below average  The good: The patio was wonderful on a pleasant summer evening with a gentle breeze.  The beer tasted GREAT.  We both found our sandwiches to be delicious.  However: We waited...and waited...and waited.  For example: we received our food but had never received napkins, knives, and forks.  We asked for these and a couple condiments.  I'm pretty sure it was five full minutes before she hurried by and dropped off these items, but took off before I could ask for the sauce that had been left off my sandwich.  Ten minutes later she appeared again.  When I asked about the sauce, the waitress confidently told me the sandwich was not supposed to have the Bonfire sauce, but I asked if she would bring some anyway.  (I later checked the menu and found her to be wrong.)  By the time she brought it, my sandwich was cold.  Even when I walked up to her to pay because I hadn't seen her to ask for the check she had me sit back down and wait some more.  It was not a busy night there and none of the other waitresses looked so busy or rushed.  Our waitress was generally friendly and said \"sorry\" a couple times but never even made it clear if she was apologizing for things taking so long or for some other reason...  We agreed we should give this place another try some time, but the slow service really wrecked what would have been a great meal."}
{"text":"Great tap selection!  Wait staff was very good and pretty quick.  They have a great patio area and I am a sucker for sitting outside!  I ordered the BYO burger w/ all of the options (cheese, sauteed mushrooms, sauteed onions and bacon).  Upon arrival the burger had cheese, sauteed mushrooms, onions straws and sauteed green and red peppers and no bacon.  I HATE green peppers so I sent the burger back explaining the green pepper situation and the no bacon.  The burger came back with no bacon and the green/red peppers picked off because the entire thing still tasted like green peppers.  I gave up and just picked all of the onions, mushrooms and cheese off.  The burger was delicious as were the sweet potato frieds.  I would go back but specify EXACTLY what I wanted on my burger."}
{"text":"Iv only been here a couple times. Don't get me wrong when I say they have great dessert but the meals not so much. My family seemed to have decent food but for some reason mine is never up to standards. My burger seemed to have been sitting awhile and the bread for soggy to touch. Had nachos and they came to me cold. I sent those back and all it tasted like was they microwaved them.. Didn't taste good at all. Not sure I'll be returned for the food but I do like the dessert. Great place to just get a drink and something sweet. Other than that, I'll start getting my meals other places."}
{"text":"Not a good experience. Enjoyed the pop rock rim and sitting outside. Ordered cheese curds to start. They were the worst I've ever had. Something was off about the batter and their cheese was not good. It wasn't at all melted (not melted on my mini burgers either). Our table also ordered a salad with tuna cooked rare. But it came out extremely well done.   Somehow despite the hoard of signs requesting you wait to be seated a large group seized the table next to us by stepping through the gate at then complaining the tables were not clean (they had yet to be bussed from the previous diners) they then dragged more tables as they became available over to their camp making a huge scene and none of the staff said anything to them.   Bad food served and bad manners accepted. I'll pass."}
{"text":"I love this place because they have they have great selection of beers but they also have a lot of specialty drinks and they have a great outdoor patio.  I however recently visited Gray's for dinner with a few friends and was pleasantly surprised at how good their food was.  I ordered the salmon sandwich with sweet potato fries and it was really good; the salmon was very juicy.  The man ordered the ribs and didn't love it so much but said it wasn't bad.  On another visit we tried the seared tuna appetizer and we both loved that!  The service at Gray's however is never outstanding unfortunately.  On several occasions the waitresses have forgotten to bring drinks or silverware.  They are also not overly friendly and don't go out of their way to be so.  In a place like this I think I would appreciate it if they were a tad bit nicer because it does have more of a sit down atmosphere to it.  Regardless, that has not stopped me from coming here.  The crowd at Gray's also tends to be a little on the older side so it never really gets too rowdy.  I've also been here on their game nights and the crowd seems to be really into it.    Gray's is a great place for dinner and drinks and I always look forward to the opportunity to go back!"}
{"text":"While Verona is one of the fastest-growing cities in Wisconsin, it is unfortunately a slowly evolving food town. I can't say there's anything here that makes it worth the short trip for Madisonians to drive southwest for dinner. Having said that, I am glad the Tied House is here. It's a well-appointed, sunny place, lots of room, nice deck for outdoor dining and a fine selection at the bar, with Gray's products being the only beer options. Hence the name Tied House. Gray's was originally brewed in Janesville and is now brewed on site here in Verona.   I can't offer a whole lot of value if you're seeking a detailed review of the Tied House's appetizers, entrees or beers. I have only been here three times, always on Friday, always for the fish fry.   The first two times, I had the fried cod option and it was just OK. The breading lacked flavor and I thought the fillets were a little thin, but they were flaky and well-prepared. This week, I had the blue gill, pan fried with an ample portion in what seemed to be a cornmeal-based breading that completed the light lake fish flavor well. I would get it again, but the $15.95 price tag surprised me when I got the bill. My son ordered the baked cod, which was cooked perfectly, seasoned with a pepper based rub and quite tasty.  The fries are crispy and hot, with a flaky breading. I ate all of mine. The cole slaw is non-offensive -- not too creamy but not a whole lot of flavor in the dressing, either. On a hot summer Friday I wanted to try a Gray's weiss bier, but they were out. They suggested the raspberry wheat, not really my style, but light and drinkable, without an offensive aftertaste. I sipped my son's Gray's strawberry soda, again not my style, but not cloying like many strawberry-flavored items.   We'll come back. You can get a cheaper fish fry in Verona, but if you're in the mood for a better atmosphere and want to try something else, the salads and entrees coming out of the kitchen looked worth ordering."}
{"text":"Our first time, my boyfriend  had an awesome veggie wrap and I the California burger, it  was grilled to perfect temperature,  with sliced avocado and melted pepper jack cheese....ummmmm However, where we sat, we could hear two types of music, something from the kitchen and whatever the front of house was playing,  a little disturbing but I think once the place fills up, you wouldn't hear it anyways. We did ask the waitress to maybe have the kitchen turn it down and I believe she tried however, it seemed the kitchens music priority out weighed ours."}
{"text":"The food is always fantastic (well - skip the biscuit that comes with the fish fry, it's dry and cold). And you the beer selection is definitely top notch. The only issue I have with Gray's is the noise level and the weird seating arrangements. The space is just not used efficiently and feels awkward. There's plenty of room to wait if needed, but actual seating is odd. It's a nice place to grab a bite with friends."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for a number of years and Gray's has had their share of ups and downs, I've typically thought of them as having OK food with sub-par service.  However, I think they've been on an uptick for both food quality and service.  Although I previously might have avoided eating here, I now don't have a problem spending my money at this establishment.  If you've had bad luck in the past, maybe give them a try again."}
{"text":"Yummy burgers, clean and cozy inside, lots of TVs to watch your favorite sport,  quick waiters, not very busy place ( Monday between 3 & 4 p.m. ). Nice joint in Verona to have burger, salad or beer!!!"}
{"text":"Went here a few weeks back to celebrate my son's engagement. It was about 6pm on a gameday Saturday, so I suspect most of the crowd was still back in Madison. Which was fine with me.  Had a fine time, so I went out here to see where the Tied House placed in terms of ratings, and saw three stars. Oh Gawd, what harm has the Millenial Indignation Squad placed on this place?  If a review starts with 'we had a coupon', stop reading because jeez, really, if student loan debt is really that hard on you that you can't just go out and enjoy life, then maybe you shoulda just went to community college the first two years.  Service was off the charts; I suspect it had a bit to do with the fact that my son is a regular. But he has good taste, and if he comes here often, that must mean that the drinks are fresh and the food is huge. Or maybe it's the fresh food and huge drinks. I dunno, tomato, tomahto.  Several appetizers were ordered and devoured. I'd say the menu was 'pub food' such as mac-and-cheese bites and Philly Steak but the fried food wasn't greasy and the apps were made by scratch, not frozen.  If those are 'average' cheese curds then you people are spoiled for choice because I thought they were damn good. They have many many taps of beer so nobody should be able to grouse about the lack of selection.   So, go. Have a beer. Lighten up."}
{"text":"We sampled a few brews and finally ordered some. The Oatmeal and the red were our fav.   Ordered the tuna as a app. Just ok. Then the buffalo chicken pizza, once again just ok. To much sauce on top and crust could have been crisper.    This visit we had burgers and fries. One was over done, hence drier, good reg fries. Mine the Tied House, presented great, tasted great, done right, sweet potato fries way under cooked. Not crispy what so ever.   Will return and try more items the next time we pass though. Not probably going to be a destination place for us."}
{"text":"I've been here at least 10 times. Mainly because of the convenience of going someplace with a decent atmosphere close to home. There's not much to choose from in Verona!   When they first opened (2007?) it was OK, but not great. Then it got really bad - horrible service, bad food, etc. But, we gave it another try last year and the food was great - a noticeable and positive difference in the kitchen, the service was prompt, and overall we had a really nice meal. Now (2012) we go here on a regular basis and always have a good meal and good service.   Atmosphere is a little hit or miss. Sometimes it feels like a family restaurant, sometimes it feels like a \"date night\" restaurant, and sometimes it feels like a sports bar.   My only true negative is the hostess staff. Not a huge deal but they generally seem confused and give off the vibe that seating you is interrupting them from doing something more important."}
{"text":"Fantastic all around. Food outstanding, service mostly great. Love the reservations option. Lots of variety of really good food!"}
{"text":"Gray's has a great atmosphere---we love the deck and the live acoustic music on Thursday evenings during the summer! The beers are pretty good (I love their Rock Hard Red...which isn't really a beer but it's a must-try if you're there)! The menu is diverse and generally tasty and I've never had a bad experience there.  I'm docking a point because I would love to see Gray's switch up how they offer live music! They seem to have some great acts but it seems like the band or performer is always stuck in the corner (when performing indoors). For as much live music as they have---and for how large the facility is---it seems crazy to me that a more distinctive area wasn't designed for such occasions. Anytime we've gone there for live music we've either been unable to see or had to sit in the dining area (which doesn't have a view and the sound is lost).   Anyways, no general complaints---if you're in the area it's a great place to check out and enjoy a few pints at!"}
{"text":"The beer was okay, the food was cooked well and to order.  Everything on the menu appeared to have a twist which even though it's creative, it's not always desired.  Being a Monday it was 2 for 1 burger day however, the waiter didn't tell us this and one of us ordered a burger, bummer we would have ordered differently had we realized it. Most of the frustration felt was after we walked in, one of us went to the restroom, the other was seated around a corner and away from the large seating area that is visable from the entrance. The hostess didn't let the party from the restroom know, even though she saw us walk in together."}
{"text":"This place was awesome. Fun, gorgeous atmosphere with live music on a Friday night. Prices are reasonable and food is delicious, cooked to perfection. Will be stopping by the next time we come through the area again."}
{"text":"Visiting Madison, our host recommended Grays as a good place for adults and kids. We had a great meal. Nice outdoor seating area, it wasn't even too busy at 7 on a Saturday night. I ordered a non-beer off the menu which I thought would be similar to a lambic. Our server told us its more like a wine cooler and steered me towards a better option, which I appreciated. We had an appetizer combo with wings, onion rings, and cheese curds. All were great. Kids loved the onion rings. For entrees we had ribs, with great sides, and buffalo chicken wrap. Sweet potato fries were awesome. They have a big party room too. Overall great experience!"}
{"text":"I've been to Gray's about a half a dozen times, different days of the week, different times of the day. Every time, the food is good (the veggie wrap is delicious), but not so much as to make me want to keep coming back.   While the orders from the kitchen always come out quickly and correctly, the wait staff isn't impressive at all. If used items need to be cleared, you have to ask for it to be done. If a refill is desired, you need to ask and hope they come back. One thing I've never experienced anywhere before: each and every time I've been there, dishes have been dropped and broken.   I wouldn't say no to going back if in a group but I certainly won't be the one to suggest returning."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why we've continued to give this place a shot over the years, but I think we've officially given it our last.  We've visited at least a half dozen times and always received friendly, but incredibly inattentive, service. Waiting upwards of 15 minutes to even be greeted by a server on two separate occasions, with multiple other staff members walking by frequently. There is obviously zero communication or any sense of pride or ownership by staff, which is a very obvious and unfortunate sign of poor management.  The food has consistently been mediocre, with the highlight of more than one meal being the side salad. We've received lukewarm soup a couple of times, but since the waitstaff are so negligent, it's not even worth it to try to get this sort of thing resolved.   The beer is fairly decent, and we've had an okay pizza or two. Everything else is honestly really disappointing and I'm shocked to see so many good reviews here. We are not tough to please."}
{"text":"Omg. I can't express my pleasant surprise enough. Dash those preconceived notions of small town restaurants! Great job!  Service: Excellent. We went twice. Both times excellent service by 2 waiters. I wish I remembered their names. Both had glasses. Anyway they were extra helpful, friendly and knowledgeable. Kudos guys!  Food: Excellent! Again, I was prepared for mediocre bar food. Whatever you do, don't get the jalapeño cheese curds or you might get addicted like me. And the pizza was awesome. Great crust, great ingredients. Our margherita pizza had some sort of sun dried tomato spread in the middle which was a tasty extra. We totally loved it. My husband had a shrimp dish which I forget now but he loved it too. Nice big plentiful shrimp. The mushroom bake could do without the cheese and have more garlic, but was still very good. Lastly, homemade root beer! You can totally pig out on all the great food. And then pay for it in the gym later....:)"}
{"text":"My recent visit to the Tied House was for a dear friend's bachelorette party dinner.  There were about 20 of us and our server was spot on.  She was aware of our crazy group's needs.  I was going for a meal to last me until I peeled off from the party so my choice was the crispy chicken sandwich and chips.  I also ordered the black and tan onion rings.  Everything was very good and filling.  My only beer here was the Porter and I liked it a lot.  I would get a growler of that in the future."}
{"text":"Standard bar food, good service, food is well prepared. Beer is pretty standard. Nothing to be amazed by but I've never been disappointed. Probably have dined or gotten take out 30 times."}
{"text":"If I could give this place no stars I would! I came here with two of my friends. I ordered a chicken Cesar salad (requested dressing on the side), when my salad came the dressing was on the salad so I sent it back. When I got the salad back they had the dressing in the side this time, however I pulled out about a handful of ROTTEN lettuce!!!! I told our server, and he was making all kinds of excuses instead of taking my salad and getting me one that wasn't all rotten, so I asked him to have the manager come over. When the manager (Shaun) came over he didn't even introduce himself to us. He asked me \"what's the problem\" at which point I pointed at a pile of rotten lettuce right next to my plate. He picked it up with his hands and said my salad would be comped (not sorry about that, and not can I replace this for you?!). My friend who ordered a burger pulled out rotten lettuce from her burger and also handed it to him. He said \"I don't know why this is rotten I just opened the bag myself\". Well Shaun, if you opened the bag and saw rotten lettuce maybe you shouldn't have served it your customers! On top of that saw him \"wash his hands\" by coming up to the sink and turning the water on for 3 seconds. He didn't use soap and I'm pretty sure 3 seconds is not enough time to wash anything off! What makes me angry is the fact that he handled my food!!!!! If he is the manager at this place he needs to be fired because he is not doing a good job at all! I will not return and I hope that people read my review. I didn't come there for a free meal I came there for dinner! I also want to say that our server didn't know anything. I had to tell him several times to go and find out things like what's in their home brewed beers, or to go get the manager because the rotten lettuce was in my plate (otherwise he wouldn't have gone), or go get the drinks we ordered the way we ordered them (and don't give me excuses on how your bartenders aren't listening to what you're telling them, that's between you guys!)  You chose to be in customer service to serve your customers, which you are not doing! Shame on you."}
{"text":"I've been to Gray's many times as Verona is lacking good restaurants to take business associates to when visiting and our office is located in Verona.  When they first opened we tried them and found them to be severely lacking in service, very slow.  But over the last couple of years they have revised their menu and must have better management because now the service is good.    I really like their food, I think they have interesting burgers, quite large and really needing a fork and knife.  I think they have a nice selection of entree's and those are well done in general however I would avoid the pizza's, they are too greasy for me.  The beer is only OK, but their soda is good.  They have come a long way and have gotten to be a place we can take people to without having to apologize."}
{"text":"Always a great place for some homemade brew and hand crafted food!  Good service,  good prices,  & good tastes!  I love coming for a shake of the day and an after work drink.  Nachos,  wings, salads & burgers all great!  Make sure to check out the daily special"}
{"text":"waited 5  min for the hostess and they were a no show so i finally left.  It was 4:30 and you'd think they'd be ready for diner rush but nope.  Sleepy place with a few drinkers hanging at the bar."}
{"text":"Two words....PUMPKIN ALE!  Seriously the best beer EVER!  GREAT food,  great bar,  love this place!"}
{"text":"So happy we found Grey's Tied House OPEN on New Year's Day.  The hostess and servers were very friendly on this holiday.   We both started with a cup of beer-cheese-bratwurst soup. It was creamy, but not too thick with tasty small pieces of bratwurst. What a wonderful combination,   highly recommend!  I chose an appetizer for my meal: Chicken tenders accompanied by raw veggies. It was served with ranch and your choice of dipping sauce (sweet chili is what I went with). The four plump, juicy chicken tenders were awesome! A+  My husband enjoyed his Grey's burger very much too.   We WILL be back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"The best place for food and awesome customer service Jake was the best we had the chipotle penne and the bleu burger"}
{"text":"I went to Gray's Tied House a few weeks ago when I was in Verona for business.  I asked the front desk of my hotel where I should eat and they recommended Gray's Tied House.  So off I went.  It is a cool, micro-brewery in South Verona.  A nice place with inside and outside eating areas.  I ordered cheese curds, ribeye, cup of their brat and cheese soup, and their molten lava cake.  I also ordered their strawberry beer,  The waitresses that helped me were super nice and answered all of my questions.  The cheese curds were great, but the portion was huge.  The ribeye was downright awesome and so tender.  The soup was so good as well.  The chocolate lava cake wasn't 'lava' at all and was pretty dry.  All in all, the meal was good but ended on a sad note with the chocolate cake.  But I would come back when I'm in the area again to try the rest of their menu."}
{"text":"Not bad for Verona. Decent food, nice setup and atmosphere, nice TV's at the bar, good service."}
{"text":"I have eaten lunch at Gray's on numerous occasions and each time I have completely enjoyed the experience. I travel about 20 weeks a year and therefore eat out my fair share. It is refreshing to eat at a local business that has food that doesn't taste like every other chain food location in the country. Granted my selection when I stop at Gray's is limited but that is only because it is so damn good every time. When I stop I always have the Red Ale Ruben, Pub Chips and a Busted Knuckle Irish Ale. Hands down this sandwich is the best Rubin I have had anywhere in the country. Thick moist slab of corned beef with just the right amount of sour kraut and dressing. Then finished off with a nice slice of melted Swiss cheese and dressing on fresh bread grilled to a crispy crust. Great stuff. The beer is flavorful, consistent and a perfect match to the sandwich. By golly I think I'll have another."}
