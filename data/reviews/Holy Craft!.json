{"text":"They're permanently closed now. Closed a few weeks ago. The place was beautiful it's a shame to see it go."}
{"text":"We have been here 3 times, and each time we are greeted with friendliness, promptness and good food & drink!  They even change the channel to Giant's baseball!  We have had appetizer's and main courses and all of it has been really good.  The Pretzel's are fresh, hot and delicious!  The Mozzarella Tomato sandwich is perfect with Sweet Potato chips and Potato chips.  The Margherita pizza makes a great dinner or appetizer!  The decor is Rustic, with old barn wood: Fun, with its Silver Barrel light fixtures; Inviting, with plenty of seating and music.  The last time we were there, there was  an after work party going on, and Holy Craft had provided some fantastic looking appetizer's!  We really enjoy this place, and will make it a regular haunt, this winter."}
{"text":"You can't come here expecting super healthy,  but you can expect super quality, fresh and local ingredients in comfort food...and for it being a bar,  it is definitely delicious,  not to mention the interesting selection of beers that are also for pairing with food!! I love how they will cater to vegetarian or vegan or gluten free. But one thing that would be nice is to maybe see different shows on the TVs rather than it being all sports... I would absolutely come back."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place a higher rating. My review is a tad late but I came here for  a Yelp event in which we got indulge in a 4 course menu with beer pairings.   The Staff was wonderful. They were really nice and attentive and they knew about the beer they were selling! The beer selection was great and I recommend any beer lover check this place out but for the beer only.  The menu for the night sounded delicious: Caesar Salad, Mushroom Arancini, Mussels and Chicken In Waffle (yes \"in\" not \"and\"). I thought the beers were paired nicely but the food was SO salty! I only ate one mussel because the broth they were served in was so salty that I could not handle eating another one. Dipping the bread in the broth only made it worse. The croutons on the salad were very garlicky (good thing my date was just a friend- phew!)"}
{"text":"Food = ? (patrons said is was the best in downtown) Price = 5 Experience = 5 (great beer selection and cool decor)"}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this place a higher rating. I really really wanted to love this place. The space is decorated beautifully, I loved the stone walls. I really has a casual vibe. And the beer selection is awesome. They have 40 beers on draft, a lot of which I haven't seen anywhere else in Cleveland.  But service is a big thing for me, and they were lacking. The bartender was unfriendly, he never smiled and only spoke to us to ask what we wanted to drink. The rest of the time he was looking through his phone. We couldn't even make eye contact with him to order some food, which sucked because the menu looked pretty good. We were sitting on the end of the bar, so we also got an earful of him complaining to the server that he didn't want to be there because he wasn't making any money.  Maybe if you interacted with your customers and smiled, you'd make some better money? With a bar like that, you have such a great opportunity to educate your customers about your substantial beer menu. It was disappointing and we ended up leaving after one drink.   I would try Holy Craft again, for the great beer menu. Maybe I'll even get a chance to order food. But seriously think about hiring people that want to be there. Poor staff really hurts this business."}
{"text":"Great beer selection but the food is the worst I've had in Cleveland. I hope this place survives because we usually drive to Ohio City to get a good beer selection, and it's nice that there is a good place within walking distance.  I've tried the chicken & waffle and one of the pizzas, and didn't finish either. In fact, didn't have more than a few bites of either...and I RARELY don't finish a plate. The pizza seemed like a frozen french bread pizza taken out of the microwave and I'm not even sure how to comment on the chicken & waffle... just all around awful. Some friends and I also split the mixed nuts, but after a few bites nobody touched them.  The atmosphere is great though, so I really do hope it survives, and I'll be back to sample some of the unique beers on tap."}
{"text":"Where have you been all my life, Holy Craft?! Glad we stopped in today without looking at the times on Yelp because they were open during the Browns game! Score. Awesome food - the pulled pork sandwich was seriously the best thing I've sunk my teeth into in weeks. Husband enjoyed the beer selection - lots of things on tap to try. Rustic decor, kinda manly but in a sexy lumberjack kinda way. We no longer live in Cleveland but will definitely stop by next time we're in town."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful time!!  Wonderful service the very attentive staff was very knowledgeable and helpful.  The peach cosmo was delish!  My companions were very impressed with the beer selection.  The pretzels were really tasty with three different dips sauces."}
{"text":"We didn't try any food, only had a few beers. Great beer selection, very informative bartender who answered many questions about the different brews and great atmosphere. We'll definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Attended the Yelp event here, but many of my friends have been raving about this plave since it opened.  Loved the samples of beer (and I am NOT a beer drinker) paired with the food, as well as the cool vibe of the place.  Also, the food we tried was fantastic.    I ordered off the menu from the event to try some different drinks and each was made well, STRONG, and the bartenders were very friendly!    Since I work very close, this will absolutely be a place we frequent again!  Thanks again, Yelp, for having us experience something new!"}
{"text":"I want so badly to give Holy Craft a higher star rating! The space is inviting and, as many other reviewers have noted, the beer selection and service are top-notch! If you are looking to have a great beer in a friendly environment, Holy Craft is a great choice.  I regret, however, that I cannot recommend the food here. Though I could see that the menu is well intentioned, all of the dishes I tried were very heavy and oily. Having had only a few bites from a tasting dinner, I left feeling rotten. If Holy Craft can make an effort to improve the quality of their ingredients and preparation, they could really be a standout in the W. 6th district. I'm rooting for you, guys!"}
