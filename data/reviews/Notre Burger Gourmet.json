{"text":"Ca faisait longtemps qu'on avait envie de goûter le mont nbg, mon copain a traversé l'orage pour aller les chercher. Au final, pas de rondelles d'oignons (alors que c'est ce qui nous donnait le plus envie), des frites trop cuites et molles, et des steaks trop cuits. Nous avons été assez déçu, d'autant plus que la qualité n'était pas à la hauteur du prix."}
{"text":"Nice decor, nice atmosphere. The burger was pretty good actually. The bun was a really nice complement and the meat wasn't over cooked. Juicy. The lettuce was crunchy too."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a shot since it opened up not too long ago near our place. AND because we wanted to eat AND drink a little alcohol :)   Our first impression of NBG was that the decor was definitely inviting. The wooden walls and table set-up gave it a large yet cozy feel. It was a Monday evening, so the place didn't have many patrons, so we had no problem being seated (a large booth in the back). There were TVs showing the Raptors game, and a full bar featuring a few specialty cocktail items. The menu also had somewhat of a sinful \"church\" theme, which makes sense since I'm guessing \"NBG\" was derived from \"NDG (Notre Dame de Grace)\" which is about as churchy as one can get. The servers were nice and helpful, though they weren't as quick to taking our order as I would have liked. They also forgot to provide basic things like our utensils and napkins and some water.   Anyways, the food. I'm not a gimmicky burger kind of guys so I ordered the \"Disciple\" (double cheeseburger with basic fixins and aoli sauce), and my partner ordered the cheese melt (which had a little bacon and i think mushrooms in it). We also ordered drinks: I had a boring red wine and my partner had the \"Tequila Resurrection\" which was kind of like a Mojito except with tequila and honey as the sweetener.   My burger was okay but a little disappointing. I didn't taste much aoli at all and overall it felt kind of dry. The patties weren't seasoned and I had to add a little ketchup just for some flavor. The cheese melt my partner ordered, however, was pretty damn good, which was funny cause you'd expect the opposite of a place that specializes in burgers.   All that said, I wouldn't say it was terrible. I'm glad there's a cozy place where I can grab a drink and a bite and watch a little sports. But I'd probably stay away from the burgers."}
{"text":"The decor is nice and service is good.   The food is... OK. I went twice and each time I left a bit disappointed..   Veggie Burger - you only taste the goat cheese.. the patty itself is blend and not enough sauce so the burger is kinda dry.   Pulled pork burger - was well seasoned,  tasty but nothing wow.. you can get better at cheaper price.   Le disciple (cheeseburger with 2 patties and aioli sauce) - Ok.. barely any sauce again, added ketchup and mayo for the flavor.   The Fries - old and dry.   The mac n cheese needs more balance with the cheese... the taste of parmesan is overpowering..at first it's good but after a few bites I had to stop.   Ceasars salad was good but again not enough sauce."}
{"text":"I went there around 1pm with my boyfriend for lunch on a Sunday.   There were 5 parties of about 3-4 people, so it wasn't very busy.   The decor is quite nice and there are 2 big screen TVs.   They have a great deal on hockey nights. 5$ for a pint of beer and 50cents per chicken wing.    On this particular day, I got the pulled pork burger and a side of fries. It was quite tasty, but very rich. 7 hours later and I'm still so full! The flavour is well balanced and it's cooked to perfection.   My boyfriend got the apocalypse and wow! That burger was... the embodiment of a heart attack! There were two very greasy/fried grilled cheeses. Each one served as a \"bun\". In the middle, there was the content of the burger. Wow. So greasy, but so good! Perfect hangover food.   Our burgers cost 14$ each.   A funny thing at that place is that the sides (fries, sweet potatoes, Poutine, etc) are all extra costs. The fries were 4$, but I don't recall the rest.   Overall, quite good! But I have to go back on hockey night to check out their wings!"}
