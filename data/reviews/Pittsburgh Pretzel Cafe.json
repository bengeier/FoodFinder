{"text":"The basic pretzels and pretzel bites are great. I got the turkey bacon club, and it was solid.  The soft drinks are from a small Philly-based company, which was cool.  I'd love to see the pretzel buns get toasted, and get the flavors ramped up a little in the sandwiches to complement the big chewy pretzel bun.  Dessert: sweet pretz-holes! Mmm."}
{"text":"I got the chicken pretzel sandwich and the pretzel bun was fresh.  I've tried pretzel buns at fast food chains and was not impressed.  These pretzel buns are the real deal.  For 6 bucks this is a way better sandwich than you could get for the same price at Sheetz or another fast food place.  Service is fast and there are a few tables inside for dine in."}
{"text":"Awesome pretzel sandwiches. Especially love the chicken salad. Staff is very nice."}
{"text":"They serve various pretzel-type foods. Be aware that they serve no \"sides\"; chips are literally chips (I expected fries or homemade chips, not Doritos).   Ordered the BBQ bacon cheeseburger and it was superb; a little too heavy on the sauce, but nonetheless, great pretzel burger."}
{"text":"I had a pretzel sandwich with chicken salad--the pretzel was soft and the chicken salad was made with all white meat.I really loved the pretzel as I find many pretzel buns to be a bit hard for my taste. I also picked up some cinnamon sugar pretzel bites for my mom which she really enjoyed. I will definately make a return trip!"}
{"text":"I had found this place by accident on yelp and decided to try it out since I am a soft pretzel fanatic. I got the sweet heat Chicken sandwich. The chicken had just the right amount of kick to it and was topped off with honey mustard. The pretzel was delicious and I was going to buy some more to take home, but the line was out the door if that gives you any indication of how good this place is. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome little place that I would have never found if it wasn't for yelp. The staff is friendly, the food is good, and the prices are right. We went on free combo day so each of our sandwiches came with a free drink and bag of chips rather than the usual $2 upcharge. I had the jalapeno grilled cheese and it was pretty tasty. It had pickled jalapenos which were just fine but I do feel like fresh jalapenos could have made it even better. I got the regular grilled cheese for my son and the turkey blt for my daughter, both equally delicious. My husband got a cheeseburger and he liked it. The pretzels were the stars of the sandwiches as they should be. The inside is small so plan to take out if anyone else is eating in. The location makes it easy to miss so be on the lookout for the big inflatable pretzel! Def recommend trying them out!"}
{"text":"I have heard of this place and stopped for lunch today. I had a cheeseburger pretzel and it was amazing.  Much, much better than a pretzel bun, this is a real pretzel with a cheeseburger in it.    The service was great also, very friendly people just makes this place that much better."}
{"text":"Awesome place, honestly stop there now! Owner is extremely friendly. The pretzels speak for themselves, amazing and fresh! The pretzel holes are great as well as the sandwiches. Sandwiches are out of this world. Place is kinda hidden due to construction, but it is worth the stop. I go almost every Saturday for the pretzels to take home! Try everything, not one thing I have had there yet that I can even say is modestly bad! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I just had the most amazing sandwich from there on the real pretzel bun! It was amazing! I had the Southwest Turkey Bacon! It was to die for! Absolutely the best sandwich ever! I love soft pretzels too! They have a special place in my heart! I can eat the 24/7. This will always be a go to for me! They are going to have a new regular out of me! No lie! Its that good! And priced so well! You wont leave there hungry or be at home hungry if you get take out!"}
{"text":"I love pretzels and these are GOOD!  The chicken salad sandwich was delicious. I suggest you stop and give it a try!!!!"}
{"text":"Nooooo! Why did you have to close?! Does anyone know if they moved or if there is a similar restaurant south of Pittsburgh?"}
{"text":"Stopped by the Pittsburgh Pretzel Cafe for a quick bite today. Very small and unassuming place, but the food was good. I ordered a cheeseburger on a pretzel bun, chips and a drink. They ran a lunch special today where you get the chips and a drink for free with your sandwich (saves you $2).....When we walked in, we were able to order right away and we had our food within 15 min. The staff was polite and the restaurant was decked out in Pittsburgh sports team banners, posters, stickers etc. Always good to support a local small business vs a chain. Worth a shot if you're looking for something a bit different."}
