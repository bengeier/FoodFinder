{"text":"Decided to give this place a try hoping to find a new authentic Mexican food spot. The service was among the worst. The waitress with glasses was rude and clearly having a shitty day or life. Couldn't really tell. The different foods on my plate were either bland or salty. The tables around me were covered in dirty dishes. Definitely not coming back."}
{"text":"Save your money. You can get twice the food at half the price at other near by mexican fast food places. Enchiladas had a really odd flavor. The red sauce that was inside them tastes as if it is ketchup based."}
{"text":"As authentic as it gets! This is the real deal when it comes to Southern Mexican food. Only reason they don't get 5 stars is because the wait time can be a while, but the food is so delicious, it is well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Hole in the wall.it was dark. We tried three dishes . Tacos chicken.  Their was no flavor. Rice and black beans were good. Chips were decent.  Hot sauce was bland. Tried their machaca  and egg burro . Meat was dry and needed more eggs. Prices are reasonable  but portions are on the small size"}
{"text":"This is the new incarnation and location of what used to be Oaxaca Restaurant in the bowling alley complex in Sunnyslope. It offers the familiar menu and small Oaxacan grocery section of its old place. The food itself has retained the flavors that patrons of the old place are familiar with: OK but could definitely be improved, and I wish their mole would be a little less sweet. The restaurant itself is spacious and the location quite convenient, though it will be even more accessible once the light rail extension construction in the area is done. Some confusion may also result from the signage on the facade of the restaurant - it reads, \"Oaxaca Restaurant - Mexican Food,\" though this used to be covered by a banner that reads \"Cocina Oaxaqueña\", which is also what is printed on the entrance signage as well as on the menu. http://blogs.phoenixnewtimes.com/bella/2014/01/cocina_oaxaquena_mexican_restaurant_phoenix_new_oaxaca.php And by the way, chapulines are available seasonally at the restaurant's refrigerated case near the counter. You can't get any delicacy more authentically Oaxacan than these!"}
{"text":"Excellent Oaxacan food. Super quick, not too expensive and they have bubble gum ice cream with real gum in it. I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Fantastic burrito! And it was vegan so even better!  They were fast, friendly, and it was super good."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here a few times. The food tastes real good but the service sucks"}
{"text":"Like previous people have said the food is delicious but the service sucks .  The waitress with glasses and black wavy hair is super rude. If you come ask for the other waitress to help you ."}
{"text":"Ambiance: Small/medium sized restaurant, approximately 14 tables, apart of a small strip mall.  Decorated with photos of Oaxacan history. Very clean and well maintained. Also includes a small grocery where one can buy Quesillo and other Oaxacan goods.  Foods: All the Oaxacan favorites are present on the menu (tlayuda, memelitas, mole etc). Been a while since I lived in Oaxaca but everything tastes the same as I remember.  Service: Friendly and patient with non-speakers.  Price: Not bad, especially since Oaxacan food is a rarity here in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Cocina Oaxaqueña is a hidden gem in the strip mall just northeast of the intersection of 19th and Bethany. Since moving to the area, it was essential that we find a new local mexican food joint. C-Oax had been on my radar for some time before I finally stopped in. As most mexican joints are sonoran, it's always a nice change of pace to visit a restaurant that does things differently. Here, mole, black beans, and a delicious salsa verde headline my visits. The restaurant is clean and the service is always excellent. I'm thrilled to have Cocina Oaxaqueña as a neighborhood mexican dining option."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim since I was getting my car washed by Mexicans next door, who did a great job by the way, heh. At first, I thought it was a ice cream shop but then I saw the menu and the sign behind the counter advertising the food they sold. The girl at the counter didn't quite understand what I asked for but her coworker did and asked her in spanish to hand me a menu.   I grabbed a seat at a table nearby and perused over at the selections available. It was relatively empty since it was early afternoon and the sun was definitely bearing down. I was sweating hard like the fat ass I am and got a bottle of coke. It was the legitimate returnable bottle of soda but they charge more for it but the girl didn't quite understand that I was asking for a fountain drink. Like I said, I don't think she quite understood much English. I ordered a three tacos to try: pastor, jerked pork and another pork selection. The waitress then brought me over some chips and two different kind of salsas, a tasty red one and a spicy green one that looked like liquidy quac. The green was not as flavorful as the red one but had a little more spicy kick to it. The tacos came and I added some of the salsa to it. Pretty good.  All in all, a good experience. Prices on the tacos were a little more than I like but not expensive. It would've been better if the waitress understood me a little more but it sufficed."}
{"text":"Me and my BMX brethren found ourselves in the area and very hungry. We rolled the dice and gave this place a shot. It sure did pay off. The place is great! The sauces were perfect and sauces are huge for me. I only didn't give five stars because they could use more vegetarian options."}
{"text":"Please see Norm R.'s review for the location and name story--he is absolutely correct, and our conversation with the owners has them looking into their Yelp posting to change the name back to the original.  But I have to disagree with him on the flavors--this is the real deal and everything is genuinely Oaxaqueño aquí.  And I say this having been through pretty much the whole State of Oaxaca hanging out with my wife's Oaxacan side of the family.  The owner/cook learned his trade in Dos Pacos en la ciudad de Oaxaca and has transferred and replicated that cuisine here with genuine ingredients from Oaxaca.  The moles are exact . . . taste like they came from el mercado Benito Juarez.  Thank God these folks are still here and still doing it the right way:  3 tipos de mole, tlayudas VERDADERAS, memelas, gorditas, botanas Oaxaqueñas, todo super delicioso.  Please come in, give them your support, and enjoy the best comida de Oaxaca we have found in this country!"}
{"text":"Handmade. Corn. Tortillas.   Are there any 3 words better than that in the English language? So so so good.   The mole is also amazing, we tried both the black and the red. If you like real deal Mexican food, you won't be disappointed."}
