{"text":"Went here based on the reviews. Ordered vegetarian dishes of Pad Thai and DC had Traditional Malay. Nothing wrong with pad thai but it lacked the traditional sauce/taste so won't order it again. Malay dish was very good - like Singapore noodles but with rice noodles instead of vermicelli. Cashier/order taker was very nice. Next time I'm going to try their rice noodles. Ordering/getting food is very well organized. Seating area was very clean. Lots of parking in the back and you can enter the restaurant from there too."}
{"text":"Do not eat here! 
I remember years and years ago this place being amazing and busy. Today my husband (who did not grow up in sauga) asked me about trying this place and said ya sure it was always good. Well not anymore. It cost 14.11 for 4 deep fried chicken wings and fried rice. When we walked in there was only one person siting down and he wasn't even eating he was having a drink!! We should have ran. Anyways there was one lady cutting onions on top of a bucket with a tray next to bleach! Eww and then another lady who took our order was filling wontons with some mysterious grey matter and never washed her hands even after using the register. On our way out I caught a glance at where the chicken wings were stored and they were in a basket/bucket ( yes another bucket ) next to the fryer not refrigerated or anything. The guy was also eating while making the food and let me tell you this place is a health hazard. Needless to say we threw out the food and grabbed Popeyes!"}
{"text":"Two Recent Takeout Meals from here, this is the average of both visits

Visit 1
1) Sweet & Sour Pork - 5/5 Massive Portion, Crispy and Delicious
2)Beef Ho Fan - 3.5/5 Decent Portion, but slightly under-seasoned

Visit 2
1) Sweet & Sour Chicken - 4/5 Good Portion, few pieces Mildly Soggy, overall good flavor
2) Shanghai Fried Noodles - 3/5 Decent Portion, not many shrimp, under seasoned. 



Food cooked per order and was quick both times. Cash only!

Place is classic, you know it's OG when they still have a \"No-Smoking Section\" sign up. 

Back area near bathrooms has a pretty bad  funk going on, but we had takeaway so it didn't bother us. 

It's nice to support independent restaurants in Mississauga that aren't just another US/Canadian franchise."}
{"text":"Where to begin. Fairly rude on the phone. All the food is absolutely flavorless. 
Dishes we ordered: 

Shrimp with mixed vegetables $8.99
Ginger beef (without rice) $8.99
Pad thai with shrimp and chicken $6.99
Lemon chicken with rice $6.99
Large hot and sour soup $4.75


Whenever we ordered a meat dish it was mostly rice or noodles. Except when we said without rice, then they charge you an extra $2 and fill the container up with broccoli instead. The lemon chicken had virtually no chicken.  The pad thai is the worst pad thai I've ever had. Absolutely no taste at all. The hot and sour soup tasted like they just mixed plum sauce with hot water.
The ginger beef (which cost 2 dollars more then usual because we replaced the rice) had no flavor. Also, they put a layer of beef on the top to make it appear as though it was full of beef. Really it was full of broccoli. Finally the shrimp with mixed vegetables tasted like that. Shrimp. Vegetables. No flavor.  No real sauce. Bland. Bland bland bland.  We ordered 5 things and not a single dish was even slightly impressive. If I could give a negative rating I would. Never ever ever will I go back to this restaurant. For a better price, we go to Golden Stove in etobicoke on lakeshore. Been going for years and they have never disappointed us. Amazing food. Amazing taste. Well worth the much longer drive then to go back to this place."}
{"text":"I've been going to this family owned joint for 12 years.  Best chicken wings in town.  It gets a lot of slack because of the terrible interior, but dont be fooled because the FOOD is inexpensive and tasty!"}
{"text":"A true Mississauga institution. Cash only keep in mind!

You don't come here for fine dinning Chinese -  which I think some former reviews I see here might have expected -  it's good ole from the heart quick serve North American Chinese.

Everything is super well priced, dishes are made quick, staff is awesome. If you're a vegetarian or vegan, don't worry about the menu, they will talk to you about what you want and come up with a dish of your creation and price it accordingly too! And you don't feel like you are putting them out of their way being picky, they are happy to always accommodate."}
{"text":"Not good enough but ok... For it to get anywhere close to the good old American Chinese soul food it needs to be greasier and saltier. More msg I say (but within acceptable limits). I had the chicken and broccoli in white sauce. Meh ... I'll give them another try though."}
{"text":"Quite disappoint today, especially for services. I only order one dish ( Taiwanese chicken) to eat in store and then let me stand next table to wait over 20 minutes!!! I can see 3 customers order taken out foods arrived later than me but got food earlier than me!!! Maybe they depends on how many dishes u order to give priority, horrible services!!! Won't come back again!!!!"}
{"text":"This is the best place for good old greasy American Chinese food. This is located in the Mississauga City Centre area and it is very popular. The establishment itself is very lackluster though very clean, and it is not a restaurant, it is set up like a fast food establishment. Almost everything on its expansive menu is between $4.99 and $5.50 and the portions are huge, enough for dinner and lunch. The service is very organized, you give the cashier your order and through microphone she tells your order to the kitchen staff. The kitchen is open, which is nice. After your order has been boxed, a different person opens each box and shows you your food to make sure you get what your order. Service is fast and efficient. Although the food is greasy you don't notice it, because of its flavor. Definitely try the Noodle Wok, if you live in Mississauga."}
{"text":"Went here often for a few months for the cheap prices and large portions. 
The noodles are tasteless and dry. Plain long grain rice, not steamed sticky rice. Meat is tough. I usually ordered the lemon chicken, which tasted just like that. Lemon sauce on chicken. The bf tried different things, but always had to ask for more sauce due to the dry crunchy noodles. And they didn't seem intentionally crunchy, I think it stemmed more from a lack of freshness.
The final straw for me was when I ordered wonton soup and the broth tasted like dish water. 
I haven't been back since.
plenty more cheap Chinese eats in the city. Avoid this one."}
{"text":"Craving some cheap greasy Chinese food? This is the place! The cashiers blare out your order over a microphone and your food shows up on the counter after 5mins. This aint fine dining, but quick fast Chinese food and the taste is awesome."}
{"text":"Place is good only when the old skinny lady isn't working, she has mood swings, she needs to retire out of the 20+ years this place has existed"}
{"text":"DINE SAFE PEEL: Inspectors 
Are  not happy with this place .

Shame on them .

{"text":"Portions are big and price is good.  Wait staff can be a little frustrating to deal with.  The actual pics of the food need to be updated as they are hard to view."}
{"text":"ive been coming here for years. i love the food. the taste has never changed so i know what to expect when im ordering. 

Ive read other peoples review under 3 stars and i have to say in disappointed in them. 

the spring rolls are amazing, Ive had tons of people try them and they all agreed they are amazing. so much more flavor than most asian restaurants. 

Me and my fiancée love the food and even my best friend from china agrees the food is great. 

The chickens are big and juicey. so crispy and not to salty. 

despite the negative people. give this place a try. its been in the top 5 places to eat so dont let a few people turn you away from trying it out."}
{"text":"Worst food ever..people are rude. They don't accept card..I would have given 0 star if that option was available.."}
{"text":"Was my very first time ever having noodle wok and I can say it was very delicious. My family and I went to the restaurant to order food, there were so many options it was hard to choose but I decided to go with the Vegetarian E-Fu noodle and the vegetable spring rolls. For the amount of food that you get, I'd say that the price is worth it not only that but the cooks were very quick so was not waiting long at all. For my first time trying E-Fu noodles I loved them they were very delicious also along with the spring rolls \"Best Veggie spring rolls I've ever had\". Overall if you love Chinese food go to this place."}
{"text":"The interior of this restaurant is not the fanciest, but for a take-out spot this is not too bad.

Service is generally FAST, however I have seen long line-ups only around the noon lunch rush time. 

They have a great big variety of dishes (with pictures on the wall) for you to choose from. 
Most dishes here come with a side of noodles or rice for $6.50! Great deal!
I got the Schezuan Chicken with a side of Noodles - only $6.50.

The food is okay, somewhat a little bland and greasy. Dishes resemble what they should in most American style Chinese restaurants. Nothing too flavourful or healthy here.

All in all a good place if you're in the mood for cheap, greasy Chinese Food."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place since I was 10-11. A decade later I still go every few months and the food is still a good. Some of the cashiers have watched my sister grow from an infant to a preteen to put it into perspective. 

The food is incredibly cheap and very quickly made. The chicken corn soup and spring roll has tasted the same for over a decade. 

The Szchewan chicken over fried rice, the beef ho fun, Singapore noodles, Malay noodles, house delight, deep fried tentacles, deep fried squid, the deep fried pork chops over fried rice and the Shanghai noodles are a must try. 

I can usually get an entree with soup or a spring roll for about $10-$15 depending on how hungry I am. You can usually feed a family of 4 on about $20-$30 here which is great!"}
{"text":"Use to be my stable for affordable, quick, and tasty Chinese \"fast food\" - but that is no longer the case. 
The prices went up almost a whopping $2, so now a dish is roughly  $10.50, whereas in the past it use to be around $8.50. 

For $10.50 I'd rather go to a dine in restaurant, and depending on which Chinese restaurant you go to in Sauga, $10.50 will most likely pay for your meal+tax+tips.

Nonetheless, I most likely won't be heading back here unless I'm in a rush - but then again... why not just order takeout at an official restaurant?

3/5 now.
5/5 in the past."}
{"text":"Was starving so decided to try this fast food takeout place. Apparently it was written up as the best fast food takeout place in sauga as posted on their wall. Thus, I had high hopes of heaping, tasty food delivered quickly.  I feel jipped. It was delivered quickly, but the brisket no rice for 9,95 included broccoli filling up more than half of the container. They should say for two dollars more substitute rice for broccoli, but I saw the actual rice and meat dishes, there was less meat.  The menu did not say I was ordering brisket with broccoli. Similarly, the deep fried squid was actually half of the container was filled with white noodle things with no taste.  They should say instead, for two dollars more substitute rice with noodle straws.  The squid itself was so bland and a bit chewy. I had to add my own salt, onion, garlic and pepper to make it taste ok.  The yang chow fried rice was the best dish, although it was not a heaping portion, it was tasty and had good amounts of BBQ pork and decent sized shrimp.  I would definitely order that again.  Overall though, I prefer maceys for beef brisket, but sometimes maceys beef brisket have the hard muscle tendons? While noodle wok's brisket is all soft.  At maceys, It is fifteen bucks with the tax for a large, but you get pure meat and can feed a family of four easily.  I wouldn't discount this place though, at least I got some veggies in my dinner, but I wish it wasn't half the container and it wasn't a surprise!  I may try their meat and rice dish for two dollars less and see if it's worth it.  In any case, if you are starving and need quick Chinese food, then you can go here. Price for all of the above is $30 tax included."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a year.  They increased their prices slightly from last time I was here.  I used to love their chicken wings but I found it to be so so this time. My son still loved the fried octopus.  Sweet and sour pork is still good.  Love their beef and egg on rice.  My kids got beef brisket chow mein and Cantonese chow mein and they were both happy with it.  Still a good little place to eat."}
{"text":"I typically avoid ordering the same dish twice. At Noodle Wok, though, I get the same thing over and over again, without fail.

1. Beef Ho Fun
2. House Delight (crispy noodles with seafood and vegetables)
3. Spicy Crispy Chicken

They're all good, every time. 

Occasionally I order the octopus tentacles too. Mmm.

Everything on their menu is so inexpensive, and the food is very good for the price. Located in the heart of Mississauga, this place is definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"On a recommendation from a friend I came to Noodle Wok. 
Super cheap food. If you are living on a really tight budget, order it from Noodle Wok.  
Plenty of parking. Clean interior. Super fast service. 
My thoughts on the poods,,,  it is,,, I guess you get what you pay for.  Lol. 
The Ho Fan Noodle is edible. 
Deep Fried Pork Chop with Chef Special Sauce is ok. 
Yang Chow Rice was flavourless. 
Beef Tenderloin in Red Sweet Sauce can only be described as Mankie.  
Their Spring Rolls taste like deep fried cardboard and cabbage. And yes I have tasted cardboard.  
The Shrimp Filled Crispy Delights,,,, deep fried shrimp incased in a popsicle stick flavoured wonton wrapper. If you eat enough of them, they actually start to taste good. 
Fukien Rice. It was ok. My daughter barfed after eating it, but I still enjoyed it. 
I can honestly say that I am  not done here yet.  I still have to try out many more of their dishes. This place is loved by many so I am confident that I will find more tasty dishes.
One Star for the Karaoke System but the Cashier is a Mic Hog.  
Stay cool Yelpers!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  Came here on Sunday and got my usual, beef black bean ho fun, and wings. Never mind barely any sauce, it was absolutely bland/flavorless.  It is black bean, it has to have a bit of a kick.  At certain times, it felt just like eating the regular dish without the Black Bean. I think it is time I look for a new go-to chinese takeout place."}
{"text":"Wows pleasantly surprised. First off, I have to admit I live in walking distance to this restaurant in Mississauga, aka commuter city, and never made it out here across the years. It's tucked away and even though it's facing the Main Street, often out of sight, out of mind applies. 

To be perfectly honest, I was expecting slightly tired looking run-down location with a small hidden kitchen. Quite the contrary. It's brightly lit, large conventional kitchen, clean and spacious, and has a steady stream of regular customers. In the ten minutes I sat there on a wednesday at 3 pm, 8 customers ordered take out. The outside shop display is extremely deceiving. Maybe because they dim out the windows with the blinding sun, beats me, but it was quite a shocker when I stepped foot on site. 

Foot was descent, not mind blowing omg-why-has-it-been-missing-in-my-entire-life. But hot, fresh ingredients that were cooked to order, and they were not frugal in the toppings. Definitely coming back if I'm looking for a fast food Cantonese take out. Only thing I can complain about is the hot sauce is not very spicy and doesn't have the usual kick I'm used to. 

Yummy in, shimmy out."}
{"text":"Updated review! This is a solid 3 for me. I've tasted better ones but if you want a quick fix then this is the place to order from.

I always order there Beef Ho Fun with no bean sprouts (just a personal preference), beef with black bean sauce, spicy salted chicken, shrimp wontons, and chicken corn soup. 

Beef Ho fun is always a must! No matter what I order, this is a staple. It's not too oily and the beef is tender not chewy. Beef with black bean sauce was too salty so I always get it with rice, the spicy salted chicken is good but not consistently crispy (I've had better ones), shrimp wontons are not stuffed...very mediocre and the red sauce that comes with it taste weird. I'm not ordering that again. The soup was ok, I had to add a bit of salt. 

Make sure to bring cash as that's the only thing they accept. It's great for take outs, I've never eaten at this place before."}
{"text":"This is definitely my go-to Chinese food joint when I'm in the area. Been coming here for years and I love this place; you definitely get a big bang from your buck. 

I always get the House Delight on crispy noodle with the sauce on the side. I love the mix of crunchy and soft noodle after some time after putting the sauce over - yumm. The ratio of meat in the sauce is also very generous which is always very pleasing to see and hard to find with regular franchised chinese restaurants. 

The beef brisket soup is something \"lighter\" to have if you're not down for something too greasy. If you're looking for something fried and/shamelessly greasy, also get the deep fried shrimp dumplings (comes with 10 pieces) and deep fried chicken wings (4 pieces). The dumplings are stuffed well with shrimp and the wings are pretty big (a lot bigger than the wings you'd get at a place like Wild Wings). 

In terms of customer service, they could improve on this department as the staff speaks limited English, but for their food, I would still give them a deserving 5 stars.

Bring cash. They don't accept debit or credit."}
{"text":"If you want fast food you are in the right place. When i walked in first impression was its a fast food place on its own. Tgey have rice toppings, noodle soup and other deep fried side orders. Price are cheap. Nothing spectacular just ordinary chinese fast food"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times in the past. Its very similar to not just noodles in downtown Toronto. 

You walk in and look at a menu which is basically just a bunch of pictures of food items on the all and you pick what you want to eat. I believe they also have a menu but really who needs to use those when you can look at warn out pictures and decide that way.

I got the hot and sour soup which was delicious, it was very similar to the sam woo hot and sour soup which is one of my favourites. I also got the chicken lo-mein.

All the food is made fresh when ordered I asked for no veggies in the lo-mein and they did this right away without any issues. The food was ready within 10 minutes. I took it home and it was delicious. 

The lo-mein was one of the best I've had. It has a lot of chicken in it. They are not skimpy on the amount of chicken they put in their dishes. 

In the past I'eve had the Singapore noodles and I really like it! Just be forewarned it has a lot of curry in it if you are not a fan.

I will be returning soon and I plan on trying different menu items. I will edit and expand my review once I try a few more items off the menu."}
{"text":"A tucked away place that has great authentic chinese along with  Canadian/ Chinese dishes.

Service is fast.  You can dine in or take out.

Portions here are great.

Its nice to see the chefs cook in front of you.

Great food dive!"}
{"text":"If you are picky about interior design then this isn't the place for you. If you love cheap eats then this place is for you. All the meals are around 6.50 and the portions are generous. I've been eating here for years and will continue to do so. I always get the shrimp wonton soup (they give you so much shrimp they aren't stingy) and the stuffed eggplant. The pad Thai is good but it isn't a traditional pad Thai sauce, black bean and chicken, chicken wings, general tso. There is a lot of selection and they have pictures of all the meals posted on the main wall. You get what you pay for and a little bit more. You can tell that they are all hard workers."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time in years!  I was here last week and before that was probably 10 years ago? 

I would love to come here more often so I can hopefully give this review a better one.  To be honest, I wasn't really here long, came in here gave them my order and within minutes my food was ready!  Talk about quick service.  I had ordered the orange chicken with rice and it did taste good however, they did give me more rice than chicken.  I should've ordered it with the noodles instead.

The place could use a little revamping, looks exactly the same as it did 10 years ago from what I remember.  The menu in the restaurant....it could use a lot of work. It could be very confusing for first timers.  There's pictures on the wall that show options of their food but it doesn't show the entire menu. Above the cashier there's more food options but it is everywhere.  I would just recommend you get the takeout menu to make your life a little easier.

Price range is very cheap and affordable.  If you want very quick and easy service and need something to eat, this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"Fresh Chinese food. Perfectly crisp, vegetable
Spring rolls. Great portions for a great cost. Can't wait to try more of their menu. Also they are one of the only places that carry sesame cake balls. Will definitely back and will keep this review updated. They have tons of options and daily deals. 
Not a 'classy' style restaurant but the food speaks for itself. No bells and whistles needed. 
Also have plenty of seating for dine in."}
{"text":"The best Chinese fast food restaurant in the city of Mississauga. The taste of their dishes are phenomenal. It was started and owned by an elderly couple who has since sold this place and moved back to Hong Kong in the late 90's. Who ever is running this establishment now has managed to keep up to par with its efficient, cost effective, humanly satisfying and pleasurable and extraordinary service. If you haven't tried Noodle Wok, take the tIme and atleast order off their daily specials menu. Great place to stop by from work after being stuck in traffic on Mavis or Burnhamthorpe road. Surprise your family with their great tasting food!!!"}
{"text":"Late night last resort, nothing more.  Threw away 80% of our $30 purchase.  Just awful."}
{"text":"I've been to Noodle Wok for the past decade and all I have to say is that it looks exactly the same and the food quality is still great. The interior is pretty ugly so if you're into looks then you will be turned off by this place. I always get take-out so the place doesn't bother me.

My favourite dish here is hands down the shanghai noodles. I've been getting that for years and will continue to do so. Pretty cheap meals for a pretty large quantity! The container feeds about three people.

This place is definitely doing something right because they've been open for decades!"}
{"text":"Updated menus and quality food for a low cost always!

Love coming here every now and then"}
{"text":"quality has gone downhill big time.  taste is off, very bland.  portions are smaller, more rice than anything.  Bad Value.  I'd go to Golden moon or Bayview garden going forward.  Also, they charged me $1.50 for using debit which was expected but after looking at my account a week later I noticed the $1.50 was charged twice."}
