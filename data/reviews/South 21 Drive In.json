{"text":"Grew up in Charlotte and moved away 31 years ago. Now, whenever I get within 2 or 3 hundred miles I will make the trip back to eat at South 21. I nearly always have the Jumbo Cheeseburger with massive amounts of the delicious onion rings. I was just there in late Sept, and they still do not disappoint. The onion rings were crispy, the cheeseburger juicy and now that I am back in Florida, I regret not eating dinner there that night also.
I have on occasion tried the Trout or the Chicken and they are also good,but as far as I am concerned it is the Jumbo Cheeseburger that has made them a staple in Charlotte for over 50 years and it also my favorite. They also have a sit down restaurant in Matthews that is a bit far depending where you live but easier to get in to than the one closer to town.

{"text":"Tough location near the old coliseum but worth the trip.  US 74/Independence Blvd. is divided there and you can only get there from the west bound lane.

Home of the Super Boy Burger. Onion rings are great.  The fried chicken has the onion ring crust on the outside but not dried out on the inside.

Overall its a drive in experience everyone should try."}
{"text":"I'm 31 and I grew up going here. It was a real treat. My mother herself had also grown up coming here. It's delicious. The onion rings are amazing. The burgers are also excellent. Despite the surrounding area having gone to crap due to the conversion of independence blvd to an expressway, and the changing demographics...if you look at the people who come here...it's obvious they drive out of their way to frequent the location. That's a great indication of the quality of an establishment."}
{"text":"Hours shown on Yelp are inaccurate Place is 5 mins from my house. It's OK. I go when I want a quick burger to take out. Not the best burgers, but close by and adequate. Worked a 14 hour day today.. beyond exhausted.. needed a fast dinner. Checked closing time on Yelp before I left the house.. says it's open til 10 pm on Fridays. Pulled in at 9:31 pm.  Doors were locked. Owner came out. Told him the hours on his listing said closing was @ 10. Just got  \"Sorry, sorry sorry..\"  The better service recovery response would have been, \"Sorry for the bad info on Yelp. We'll be here for a while closing down so we'll make your dinner for you.\"  I can get an average or better burger elsewhere so I won't be going back there again. Trump would say,  \"Overrated!  Sad!\""}
{"text":"Good food & good service . Try the Cherry Lemon Sundrop.The onion rings are the best!"}
{"text":"I eat about every week and never had a bad meal their yet. The trout plate is as good as any fish camp you can go to. I highly recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Went here only because it was featured on diners, drive-ins, and dives. A big disappointment. The chicken was dry, the pork BBQ was decent but the buns were uncut and way too small. Cole slaw was flavorless."}
{"text":"Very underwhelming.... The BBQ chicken is FRIED and slathered in BBQ sauce... Ew. The burger was average. Not quite sure why the onions rings are famous. Wendy's is better."}
{"text":"Great burgers and shakes. Worth risking your life exiting off of Independence."}
{"text":"Have been eating the fried trout for at least 55 years. Always fabulous. Get an extra tartar sauce or you will regret it. Onion rings and superbly are always great. Never disappointed. You have to try the trout. You will never believe how good it is. And they have cherry lemon sundrop.  Best sweet tea. What are you waiting on. Just be warned. They always close the week of the 4th. Does not matter if you go to drive inn on independence or the newer one in Matthews.  Go."}
{"text":"Great food for great food.  Fun atmosphere.  When my brother comes to town he always wants to go to South 21 for fried chicken.  We really enjoy the food there and it is always fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Okay where do i start..lets do the positive first (momma said be nice)food wasn't bad but wasn't ass good as portrayed to be. Okay now lets talk about the service woman taking order over intercom talked over me soo much i barely  had the time to get my order out before she said \" Is that it\". The servers was black men dressed in uniform, did i mention the pale complex people who worked the inside didn't have uniforms, okay lets talk more, how about these black servers looked right over us (black folk) never asked if we needed anything hows our dinner nothing. They proceeded to entertain the pale complex people and never not once interacted with us, other than the young black that brought us our food and never returned for our change(i guess he thought us black folk couldn't afford a tip), needless to say service was extremely poor i felt like we was back in 50's when racism was at an all time high, was soo excited to go there all over this diner drive ins and dines, lets just say that will be the first last time if it was the last restaurant standing."}
{"text":"My cousin used to work here when I was around 7 years old. He would always bring home some food. This place is dear to my heart. South 21 has some of the best burgers and a great grilled chicken sandwich. But, by far, south 21 has the best onion rings ever. I go to school out of state now and whenever I come back home to Charlotte, I make stopping here a must."}
{"text":"It's good old school diner food and the drive in experience is part of the fun.  I had the super boy burger and an order of onion rings.  The burger was good but the onion rings made the meal.  I would have liked more than 6 rings in an order.  I wouldn't go out of my way for the food but it gets a higher rating because finding a place to sit where I can bring my dogs is always a challenge."}
{"text":"Love this place, i go here to get a simple burger fix, i like the way it is served also, just shredded lettuce, mustard, and a tomato. Fries aren't too bad either...have been visiting for years, it is a drive in so you get what ya get! (as far as service goes) Price range is always under $10 if you re by yourself   =0)"}
{"text":"For a late night stop, this place hit the spot. I had the chopped steak plate. Can't beat the price for quick drive in food."}
{"text":"A staple in Charlotte. Even Guy Fieri says so!  Best trout plate there is. They are fast and friendly. If you love an old fashioned cheeseburger and onion rings this is the place. Don't forget your cherry lemon sun drop!!!"}
{"text":"My son and I really enjoyed our first experience at south 21. Great service. Jumbo cheeseburger, hot dog and chili was all very good. We will come back again."}
{"text":"If you need an old school burger or some quick fried chicken or fish, this is your place. Drive-in style or you can order it to go. Nowhere to sit down inside, but perfect for a bit of nostalgia or a fun and different dinner. Not healthy, but tasty. Don't forget the milkshakes, they're delicious & hard to pass up."}
{"text":"Always a great stop for a burger....don't forgert to add cherry to any soda...yum"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the onion rings and burgers.  Like someone below said an employee was smoking in front of my car, but they were far enough away and I didn't think it took away at all.  Also the tables swivel."}
{"text":"Yummmmmmmmyyyyyyyy. Seen on Triple D and since we're new to Columbia we decided to drive over for the day.  I am so glad we did!  The onion rings are slammin!!!! If you get nothing else make sure it's those rings! With a side of their ridiculously good tarter sauce!!! Ohhhh my!  Burgers were solid too.  Service was fast and friendly!! Did I say yummy?!?!"}
{"text":"Classic drive in joint.  We had an array of burgers, fries, and onion rings.  Burgers were simple and very well done, while the onion rings were top flight.  On a warm summer night, the atmosphere provided by ordering through a steel speaker and having great hot food delivered through your window is pretty hard to beat."}
{"text":"Of course, like many, I saw this place on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives so I gave it a try because the food looked amazing! I really wanted a good, juicy, run down your arm, dripping with goodness BURGER! 

 Now let's talk about this burger. My mouth was watering for this SUPER BOY Burger, how the juices was going to flow when I bit into it, how the bun was going to be super soft, how i was going to taste the crisp coolness of the lettuce, onions, and tomatoes and how the mayo was going to be the right amount to make the juices flow down my arm because you know that's what I saw on TV, lol.

NOT! BIG disappointment, my bun was  over cooked in my case, actually it was toasted so hard I dang near couldn't bite it. The burger was so dry and tasteless I needed a sip of my drink after every bite. There was no Mayo or onions. It was topped with the most disgusting pickle I've seen in life! Just a gross, shriveled up, dry pickle.  I also ordered the fries which were mediocre regular fries. 

My husband had the double fish sandwich and the famous onion rings. He said both were okay, it wasn't bad but it wasn't the best he's ever tasted. I agreed about the onion rings but i was so disappointed with the burger, I didn't dare taste the fish. He did however like the Tarter sauce.

Now the dessert, lol..yes, it was laughable. We had the Boston Cream Pie. I cannot believe they would actually call it Pie. It was a crumbly yellow cake with vanilla pudding filling topped with chocolate icing  

I'm giving it 2 stars only because my husband like the Tartar sauce,  the food was hot, and the servers were really pleasant, NOT the person taking the order, she was rude, a bit rushed and very short tempered."}
{"text":"Ok. So I saw this place on Diners Drive ins and Dives. I thought when we're up in Charlotte we would swing by and give it a shot. I'm glad we went but I really can't say I was that impressed. Yes. The onion rings are good but the hamburgers are just average as was everything else. It was packed when we were there but I don't think we would go again."}
{"text":"If you're in the Charlotte area, this is the closest to a classic Drive-In that you can get, and it is amazing! I have been to South 21 so many times with my family it is incredible! And since this place has been in business for almost 60 years, that should definitely be a testament to how good it is!

They have great service and fantastic food! I definitely recommend the burgers and you have to try the onion rings! You just get to drive up, press a button, and order whatever you'd like off of their tasty menu. After that, you will receive service with a smile and a delicious meal! 

South 21 is definitely a no-brainer if you are looking for good Drive-In food!"}
{"text":"Classic greasy burger. I got a regular burger Carolina style and it was pretty good. I don't think it's anything to write home about; but it's cheap and did the job. 

Now the Strawberry pie is another story. I don't know if it's just me; but I like a thick crust with a buttery flavor. I don't like the \"goo\" that comes with the strawberries. I prefer fresh berries. I'd say my favorite part of the pie is the \"Cool Whip\"... and that's not a good thing; as I'm assuming this was seriously Cool Whip and not freshly made. 

Perhaps my palette was expecting something else. I would be keen to go back and try another burger and maybe throw in some fries or Onion rings. It's a decent alternative for something quick and fatty."}
{"text":"This is the original location as far as I'm concerned. The others are great, too - and each has its charm... but Independence Blvd is where the onion rings are always hot and perfect, and the full menu is always available. Wonderfully sweet people."}
{"text":"I have been eating here since I was a kid.  This is by far the best Drive-In. There's nothing better than a trout dinner with onion rings & a coke.  If you are in Charlotte, or even close, you need to experience this at least once."}
{"text":"This is some of the best fried chicken in Charlotte.  This awesome drive in is a spot we hit sometimes coming back from golf.  The prices are so low i can scrounge change out of my seat and pay for chicken that IMO is better than Price's.  South 21 you gained a piece of my heart."}
{"text":"Order your burger \"Carolina Style\" and get the onion rings. Shakes ain't too shabby either."}
{"text":"They've clearly been doing something right these past 58 years. 

Best onion rings you will have in your life!  The breading on them is not thick and crumbly and the onions texture is spot on.  ALWAYS order the rings.

The burgers are tasty as are the fries.  Next time we'll try the chicken. And there will be a next time and a time after that. 

This place is a true classic, good food, good service and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"My dad saw this place on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives, so we decided to give this place a go.  Wasn't that impressed, but it's still a cool place to check out.

When we first got there, we parked and tried to buzz the workers twice on the intercom, but no answered after sitting there waiting for about 5 minutes.  So my dad and I finally went in to go and order our food, which they said that the intercom works, but I guess they just didn't hear it... The workers are friendly. 

You pay once you get your food and they do take card as well. Pretty reasonable prices for a place that's been serving since 1955.

For me, the chicken was a little bit on a dryer side, but I guess I'm just more of a dark meat person. My dad said it was a juicier white meat chicken for him. Also ordered the onion rings, but I was still a little disappointed by that because I had a lot of thin slices of onions in my order, but maybe I was just unlucky. I also felt that the batter was a bit overcooked and a lot more crunchier than I'd normally like it to be.  The cheeseburger was just all right for my sister and me."}
{"text":"I was very skeptical about this drive and Diner to say the least, but I was very surprised! It sort of reminds me of Five Guys without the exorbitant prices and the greasines. All in all real solid food great burger and I spent less than $6... I call that a win I don't think my cholesterol can handle me eating here everyday but it's a great once in awhile stop I'm glad to see a place that's been around for almost 50 years still in Charlotte."}
{"text":"A classic. You can't go wrong with anything. It's just good, greasy food at its best!"}
{"text":"Great stop for burger and fries! Plus it has the historic/local aspect of it that makes it fun! There's no room to eat inside so just know ahead of time to get to go, eat outside at picnic tables, or in car."}
{"text":"This is a fun place and a cool place, but I'll have to visit it again to hopefully up the star rating in the future.  I have the misfortune of working out this direction and was pleasantly surprised to see South 21 Drive-in sticking out in a neighborhood of dilapidated buildings and BLAH-chain restaurants/stores.  I originally was worried that the place had closed down since it was never open when I drove by (after 10pm or on Sundays).  Some research online produced the food network visit and a menu and the date was set for my GF and I to drive out here for a visit.

My dire poverty makes this roughly the one time I ate at a restaurant in many months, so we went into this with pretty high expectations and an equivalent level of excitement.  We got there a little bit later than we had hoped and although the staff didn't rush us, I felt rushed because I knew they'd be closing soon.  We got a super-boy, a cheeseburger, onion rings, and two milk shakes.  I really made a huge splurge and spent about $16.  The burgers were ok, but nothing like I had imagined, they were pretty run of the mill and not nearly as good as I had hoped. I had been craving a non-chain, off the griddle, greasy burger and this one was slightly dry and without a whole lot of taste.  We didn't realize that to get the specialty with \"slaw\" and other \"fixin's\"you need to ask for it \"Carolina Style.\"  The onion rings were OK, but not that fresh, so I'd like to try them again earlier in the evening.   The milkshakes were also just OK.  The people were nice and the owner seemed like a nice guy and he asked us how things went.  (my GF randomly ran into him on his day off and he was also pleasant... I like to buy food/things from good people so this is a plus in my book).  

All-in-all not bad, but not right on the mark.  I'd love to go back again though and do it right, especially if I could go on a nice summer day (are there any in Charlotte that aren't too hot though!?!).  It's a place with history and fun in a city that has converted most of it's history into parking lots, so it's worth a try!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best onion rings that I've ever had. Old school diner with excellent burgers, and fish. Iconic restaurant in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I have to admit I grew up on South 21 and have been a fan ever since. As far back as the late 60's did my family go here. I recently went again on a visit to Charlotte and this time it was almost as good as I remember it. I always get the fried trout dinner and it is always great. It was tender and very tasty. It came with french fries, roll, coleslaw and tarter sauce. I have never been a fan of those last two so I never eat them.  The roll in my opinion is just a regular roll and does not stand out. The french fries are about the same as the roll nothing really special but tasty non the less. I also got an order of onion rings. To this day they are my favorite. I will say that on this particular time they seemed not as hot as before but still tasty.  My husband got the hamburger steak with grilled onions. For once he was the indecisive one. I had a taste and it was tender and juicy and the onions were grilled perfectly. He usually gets the Super Boy and likes it very much."}
{"text":"Not sure whether to give this place 2 or 3 stars. The food is not bad, but nothing special. Maybe my expectations were too high. The drive-in itself was cool though.

My boyfriend and I recently moved to Charlotte and decided to drive a little out of the way for South 21 based on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives and Yelp reviews. We got the Super Boy, a hamburger, 2x fries, cole slaw, Coke, and water. My boyfriend loves onion rings and cole slaw, they are almost more important to him than the burger. I could have sworn I ordered the onion rings instead of fries for him, but we received fries for both orders. I know I ordered a large Coke but received a Coke the same size of his water. There wasn't a long wait, but we had to be home to meet someone so we overlooked the Coke size and onion rings to head home.

Upon getting home, I took a few pics and we dug in. I like sweet cole slaw, but don't like cole slaw enough to get a full side of it. I asked my boyfriend if I could have some of his (they gave us a full to go burger tray of it) to try. We both ate and there wasn't much commentary. Neither of us wanted to admit it was a let down from what we expected. We agreed the burger was not bad, it was OK, but it tasted like a Sonic burger which we could have gotten from the $1 menu. The slaw was not sweet and while it may be someone else's fave, we ended up tossing it. The fries were just regular fries. The food wasn't bad, but nothing unique, no wow factor. We felt we paid a little too much for meals we could have gotten elsewhere cheaper and been more satisfied.

We might come back for him to try the onion rings and maybe we'll try something else on the menu, but we won't make any special trips.


EDIT 3/29: I found the receipt, which confirms we did order onion rings and a large coke, we just didn't receive them."}
{"text":"We stopped in very shortly before closing time, but despite that they happily served us. The food was very good, and tasted very hot and fresh. The fried chicken was extremely moist and very crispy, but not greasy at all so it was no big deal to eat in the car.  The fish was also very tender but still crisp. We also got an order of onion rings, which were absolutely perfect. My only complaint is that everything needed some salt or seasoning of some sort. No big deal, but it would have been phenomenal with it. We did not try any desserts, but they all sounded very good too. Definitely would eat here again."}
{"text":"The most awesome drive-in ever! Everything is good, from burgers to onion rings to trout. 
You can't go wrong. This place has been here since the 50's and it never disappoints."}
{"text":"This was a neat little spot to capture moments of time from an era that I have never lived in.  As I am sure that it is a nice place for older people to come with their old ladies to capture that feeling they had back in the day in their '58 Cadillac after a drive in movie.  There wasn't a ton of things on the menu that I could choose from, so I got a huge bucket of fries smothered with cheese.  A friend of mine ordered a cheese burger and it was humongeous!  If you are a red meat lover I think you should check this place out.  I think that it is a pretty great place to relax in your ride."}
{"text":"YOU MUST VISIT. HOLY COW. We happened to stumble upon this drive in while driving around Charlotte and BOY am I glad we did. Our new fave. Think 60s style drive in theatre type and here we are. The food is KILLER. Do yourself and your belly a favor and order the Super Boy burger. This place is golden and a real treat. Me, my fiance and our toddler all had so much fun and enjoyed dinner. I wish the location was farther away from the hwy but hey, can't have your cake and eat it too!!!"}
{"text":"Great first experience at this fast food destination before a Hockey game. I had a cheeseburger and some onion rings. The place was packed but service was amazing, considering, with stylish gentleman in black hats and sweaters delivering food in the cold weather. My mom's ham and cheese looked amazing, my sister loved the steak sandwich, and my dad had the fish dinner. No complaints. Thank you for a great dinner guys!"}
{"text":"My parents always took us to South 21 starting in the EARLY 60's, I also took my kids. I have since moved away but when I'm in Charlotte this is the 1st place we go. I grew up loving the burgers, onion rings, slaw,Trout and chicken. I would love to have the recipe for their breading for the fish, chicken and onion rings."}
{"text":"I used to drive past this place all the time, but I never managed to drive by it while I was hungry and it was open.  I love drive-ins - they are a piece of our history that is nearly lost.  Luckily, I can stop by South 21 Drive In when I'm feeling nostalgic.

Upon arriving, I was pleasantly surprised that the intercom still worked.  The menu was reasonably readable, the intercom sounded clear, and I didn't have to shout my order repeatedly to get what I wanted.  My first trip, I ordered the regular fried chicken.  It was pretty good, with a nice, crisp batter on the outside and tender meat.  The onion rings are good, but nothing makes them stand out from other homemade onion rings.  I thought their cole slaw was a little unique and good.  I think their dinner bread was very blah; maybe just a hamburger bun?

Next time I came I had their BBQ chicken, which made their fried chicken pretty darn tasty.  I had their fries that time, which were pretty standard.  I also tried the cherry Sundrop and love it - what a great idea!  I have yet to try their burgers, but one of these days I will.

Service both time I went was friendly and quick.  I seem to recall that they might take cards, but I can't remember for sure.  And they have plenty of places to park and eat, or it's easy to get your food and take it home.

I am so glad to have stopped at South 21."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in my visit of this establishment.  I ordered  1/2 fried chicken dinner and a order of onion rings.  The fries were old and cold.  The young Spanish guy who brought my order out didn't give me my change. I had to ask for it.  He said my bad.  Then I gave him a tip and I'm riding down the road trying to eat my food and found out he didn't give me any napkins.  You are a car hop, you should always have napkins."}
{"text":"Nostalgically delicious. Aside from the employees smoking directly in front of my car, everything was great. Quick service, and quality of food is comparable to what i was expecting for the price. If you want a soda-shop style burger, sandwich, or dog on a budget, this is the place. And who doesn't love crushed ice? Extremely affordable, and even though it's right off 77, nice and quiet under the eaves. French fries could use some seasoning, and the hot dog was a little bland, but the chili, grilled onions, mustard, and pickles that came on it gave it some flavor. The burger was great, thin, but great.  Sesame bun, lettuce, and nice red tomatoes. Fun place to hit up after a day at the pool with kids or a casual Friday night before a movie. I'll go back."}
{"text":"I've been eating here all of my life, and now that I live across the country, this is always my first stop when I come back for a visit. These are the BEST onion rings that you'll ever have! The fish-o-burger is amazing and the coleslaw is vinegar based and truly out of this world. Maybe not the healthiest menu, but if you give yourself permission to splurge, absolutely delicious! Order a real cherry coke! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"well, hell.  my 100th review had to go to something special right?

South 21 I guess you'll be it.  

The onion rings are to DIE for.  Love them.  Perfect crunch, even after they got a bit cold.  The crust on it, oh man, golden brown and delicious!

I got the fried chicken.  YUM!  The crust on the onion rings were basically the same on the fried chicken.  They were nice and crunchy and the chicken was moist, and I got white meat.  Granted, it's not the best fried chicken I've had, but this is definitely up there for sure, just on the moistness of the chicken and the crust.  I do wish there was more flavor in either the crust or the chicken.  

And to top it off - I got a cherry SunDrop to drink.  Now that was awesome since it wasn't the bottled kind - it was mixed at the place, which just tastes better.

Sorry - I usually do real well with pictures, but we were all eating from our laps in the car, so it was a bit rough.

Thank you South 21.  I guess there is good reason why you are still around after all these years!"}
{"text":"*Very quick*
*Closed Sun and Mon*

I have wanted to try this drive in ever since we moved to the area. We needed something quick while we were out running errands and saw that it was quite busy on a Saturday afternoon, so we decided to stop by. 

The service was so quick for a place that is made after you order. We ordered and ate here although you can easily order to go from inside or your car. 

Food was fresh and tasted great. It was about what I expected (good drive in food)--we got the Superboy, Cheeseburger and fries. I noticed they are closed Sunday and Monday, but open fairly late (9:30 pm) from Wed-Saturday. Fries had no salt on them which I appreciated (I know, the blasphemy!) 

I saw a ton of people ordering inside and taking food to go. They also have restrooms if you need them on the side of the building. They were thankfully very clean! 

Try it out if you're ever in the area, especially if you need a break from the traditional restaurants on this side of town."}
{"text":"I simply love this little place  long before it was on triple D. I often took my daughters there the food is good and the servers are walking history. Tonight my carve side server has been there for 61 years and he is still there. He started working there two weeks after they opened. He was amazing. The other gentleman has been there over 40 plus years. Its family owned and I love the sense of loyalty to their employees. I'm sure he couldn't have left many times and working during segregated times must have been hard. So tonight I celebrate the workers of this restaurant you are great."}
{"text":"This sort of drive-in is a vanishing breed. Rather than going in to eat, or pulling through a window in a hurry, you pull up to the box and try and get everyone to look at a tiny menu. Then someone brings it out to you and you figure out how everyone will get what they ordered and eat it in the tiny space of your vehicle. Awesome, and that is just the experience.

As to the food? Very respectable, especially if you stick with the burgers. Perhaps even some of the best in town, keeping in mind that these are not gourmet by any stretch of the imagination. Just straight up simple hamburgers, and that's the way they should be done sometimes.

While other South 21 locations (notably the one in Matthews) take credit cards, not sure if this one does - at the very least, you're making someone walk a good distance. You might want to take cash."}
{"text":"The BEST FRIED TROUT & Tarter Sauce EVER!   Featured on the FOOD Network for a reason... my South 21 Delivers everytime. One of a couple of places I stop by after coming back into town to welcome me home. A Charlotte Classic & Staple for over 60 Years!!!!  There is car-hop service or you can call a-head and go inside to pickup ( Recommended if your not eating there.  )   Call ahead orders are ready in 10min  even on busy weeekends!  so don't wait, ( when they say ready in 10 they mean it !! :)  They take Credit-Debit & Cash.. Everything is good if not great!! For over 3 Decades they haven't slipped once and I eat there weekly. Solid, safe, & great for the soul at a good price... something kinda like home. !"}
{"text":"If you are in Charlotte, you have to give this place a try. Their fried chicken is one of the best I've had. It's light, not greasy, and so tasty. It's crunchy on the outside but so moist and soft in the inside. Their fried trout is delicous too. It's fresh and not greasy at all. It tastes even better if you squeeze some lemon on top and eat it with their tartar sauce."}
{"text":"This place has been open for a very long time, and there is a reason to it. 

Despite being on 74 the way it is, South 21 is by far one of my favorite places to go. I love most of the things on the menu, from the chicken, jumbo cheeseburger to even the hot dogs. I hope one day I can bring my kids here like how my parents brought me here growing up."}
{"text":"The first week of living in Charlotte I drove by this place and made a mental note of it. I actually thought it was closed down though because it seemed like every time I drove by there were no cars there. I even told myself how much of a shame it'd be if it were no longer open and I'd have to investigate it to see. 

Well after I found my job, I was driving past it every day, and finally starting to see cars on my way home from work. I ran inside my house to let my boyfriend know, and he had no idea what place I was talking about. I'm the foodie in our house for sure... haha

Well finally after being here for 2 months, we went to check it out. Cars ride your bumper here and turning in was a bit of a feat, but we made it. We pulled up to a speaker box, and sat there for a few pondering over what food we wanted to fill our tummies with. I ordered the BBQ which came with fries, coleslaw and a roll. He ordered the rib eye sandwich which came with fries, onion rings and a salad. We got all that food and two drinks for $16.00. That was crazy! 

Honestly, the food, was just ok to me, but it was more about the experience. I ate some of my honey's onion rings though, and holy crap were they good! I seriously think they may have been the best onion rings I've ever had!! I would go back in a second just for some of those things. 

There are definitely a few things I'd like to try off the menu, so I'll go back soon, and when I do onion rings are at the top of my list to cram in my face. This place is also different as a drive in to me, because they give you free refills! It's sort of a feat to get a refill, but good to know it's an option.

Word to the wise, be careful turning out of this place. I never took that into account and I had a heck of a time trying to turn onto the mini highway here. Sheesh... good thing I've got a lead foot. Go speed racer goooooo!"}
{"text":"I do like a good burger and onion ring combo and a milkshake to sweeten the deal. That is exactly what i got in a box big enough to feed two for 7 dollars it was a great deal. I will be back quite often."}
{"text":"NEVER A BAD MOMENT

I have been going to South 21 since I was a little boy and the food never fails. I've been to all the locations even the one they closed on South Blvd and each one I've gotten the same wonderful experience.  If you really want that classic flare of the past with GREAT FOOD, this is the place to come!!  I have tried almost everything on the menu but my favorite is the Fish O Burger!  Always fills me up and the homemade tartar sauce is to die for.  I usually order a large tub of it to dip my fries in and also order an extra vinegar base cole slaw as well. 
Always a winner to me with plenty of other things on the menu to fill your hunger.  Plus, it's pretty cheap for a family of four or just date night to eat there."}
{"text":"My wife had the grilled ham and cheese and said it was excellent! I had the barbecue and it was average at best. If I come here again I will definitely try the fried chicken. The fries and onion rings were very good."}
{"text":"First time at South 21 and I was shocked. Let me tell you why.

1. The presentation of the food was good.
2. The food was fabulous.
3. The service was good. Had to give a $2.00 tip
4. The price was good.
5. The food was fresh and made to order 
6. The food was made just like I requested.

Con: The young lady that took the order rushed me to order and acted like I was bothering her before I even said 1 word and throughout her taking my order.... which was a simple order.

I ordered a jumbo cheeseburger with bacon (well done) with fries, onion rings and a coke.

Overall experience was 4.5 stars ...I took 1/2 star because of the young lady being rude. I'm really big on customer service.

I will go back..not anytime soon because I don't eat out like that..and I don't eat burgers like that...maybe I will try the fish next time."}
{"text":"The idea of this drive thru is fun. It reminds me of a place in my hometown in Ohio which I loved.  The food was very disappointing! I have been to the other location in Matthews and it tasted much better. I was sad because this place is closer to me.  Will not be back."}
{"text":"I love the old school feel to this place. Great food and good service. I had the sirloin steak sandwich. It was really good and I would recommend it to anyone looking for something different to eat for lunch."}
{"text":"found this place through the Food Network app, that has a list of places Guy Feiri visited... from the Divers,Driveins and Dines' prog...
got the crisp chicken sandwich and the onion rings...the cripsy chicken dint impress me much..i think it lacks seasoning...the crust is nice and crisp... but not so much the taste! but the onion rings are the BEST ive eaten to date! amazingly crispy..even when it cools down!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst. My husband and I were in Charlotte for the day and were looking forward to trying this drive-in that not only was featured on Triple D but which had so many positive Yelp reviews. Unfortunately, our experience was in line with the minority of reviewers who gave this place low ratings.

My husband ordered the fried trout plate and I got a burger \"Carolina style\" (mustard/onions/chili/slaw) and some of their supposedly fabulous onion rings.

The food was, for lack of a better description, rank. The chili on my burger had a very unpleasant aftertaste and the slaw had no taste at all. I tried scraping everything off the burger and covering it with catsup, but it was still inedible. The \"fabulous\" onion rings were brittle, with none of the \"yumminess\" of delicious onion rings. My husband ate a few bites of his fish, also proclaimed the slaw completely tasteless, and was done. He also said the tartar sauce which so many people raved about tasted \"off\" and not at all like real tartar sauce.

So that was it. $20 plus $2 tip for curbside service -- a total of $22 for nasty tasting, verging on rancid, food. Five hours later and we're both still feeling a bit queasy and not the least interested in eating anything else today.

I have no idea how this place has thrived for over 50 years. You can get vastly better chili burgers and onion rings at Sonic!"}
{"text":"I, like the majority of others on here, learned about this place from Diners, Drive ins and Dives. On a recent night we were going out for drinks with friends and decided to stop here for dinner. It was good, but not awesome. 

I got the SuperBoy with onion rings. I liked the fresh grilled taste of the burger, but it lacked seasoning. The onion rings were underwhelming and they only gave me a few. They were pretty thin and I prefer a thick onion ring. 
My boyfriend got a jumbo cheeseburger and fries. He thought it was tasty but would add bacon the next time. He liked the fries. 
We shared a slice of apple pie. It was okay. 

The biggest positive of this place were the friendly employees. The gentleman who brought our food out stood at our window and chatted for awhile. We really enjoyed his company"}
{"text":"Fried chicken was great and very reasonable.  Excellent service.  Onion rings are recommended too."}
{"text":"Love it! Been eating here since I was a kid. The food is good and the service is good as well. This is a drive in with the nostalgia of a more simpler time when a burger and fries was a treat and not a \"foodie\" experience. I love this place and will continue to eat here until the sad time when it becomes extinct like the drive in movies. This place is worth the drive and it was featured in Diners Dive ins and dives. Go, take the family, you won't regret it and will go back again and again!"}
{"text":"Okay,  once again I had to rely on TV to find this place.  I suppose I could have just read other Yelp reviews, but considering I never knew South 21 existed...

Anyway, It's fun!  I mean, the food was tasty and very authentic for a drive-in.  I loved the ambiance and was sad the car hops didn't come out on roller skates!! I mean, what's wrong with skates?!

I ordered the chicken fillet sandwich and it was tasty.  I will say the onion rings were fantastic and I'm not a fan of onion rings AT ALL!! My only complaint was my husband's grilled cheese, which wasn't up to par.  The bread wasn't toasted AT ALL and the cheese wasn't even melted!  :(

I will definitely return!  I took a friend there and she absolutely had a good time, so it's A-ok by me!  I might have to teach them how to make grilled cheese though..."}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat. I work in the area and often order the trout plate to carry out on Friday for lunch. It's not changed in 30 yrs, always great , the onion rings are fantastic. They have the best Taurter sauce in town with out exception. They also have good burgers."}
{"text":"Although I had heard great things about the Fried Chicken, I had to go with a cheeseburger on my recent visit to South 21. This has been a place I have driven past for over 15 years and cannot believe I have never been.

The overall experience is fun, old school drive thru, order and your food is bought to you.  True diner food, burgers, fries, onion rings in large portions and good prices.  The burger was good and I enjoyed both the fries and onion rings."}
{"text":"This place Rocks. Saw it on DDD. The onion rings are the Best. Fish sandwich are  Amazing Cheeseburgers are From Heaven and Chicken better than your grandmothers. A must do in Charlotte."}
{"text":"South 21 has certain menu items that are killer, and some, not so much.  The fried chicken is some of the best in town, as it is extra crispy and not greasy.  The same crispy breading is found on their onion rings, and the fried filet of trout, which is actually cod.  Their cole slaw is vinegar based, which I prefer, but most don't care for it.  They have a unique tartar sauce which I would love to know how they make it.

The fried chicken is a every day except Friday special, hamburger steak is the Tuesday and Thursday special, but their hamburger is not as good as most other items.  I believe you can trace this to the apparent lack of seasoning.  Wednesday and Friday special is the trout dinner except at the Matthews location.  They need to have that on Wednesday at that location (hint hint).  Their ice tea is perfect.

The original location on South Boulevard is gone.  After they were robbed, the Copis brothers sold to an Asian and the menu went to hell.  Tofu, egg rolls, and fried rice have no place here.  Luckily, they took it back over and returned the classic menu before throwing in the towel after light rail killed this business.  The Independence Blvd location is a mirror image of the South Blvd location, but after eating, you get to test your drag racing skills upon leaving, as you have to get to 60 pretty quick to merge into traffic.  The Matthews location in an old McDonald's is the cleanest of the eat in locations, and the other locations are North Tryon near the NC 49/University Blvd, and Highway 16 north of I-85.

If you are really old, go to the Independence Blvd drive in location and shout your demand for grub into a 1955 intercom.  It still works better than some cell phones!"}
{"text":"Errands around town and driving past this place and always wanting to try it out, quickly led to me pulling in.

I pulled up to a car space and decided to order from my car. We ordered fairly easy and our food was out pretty quickly. My interaction with employees was fast, polite and straightforward. 

The parking lot left a lot to be desired. It was pretty messy. The trash bins were full, and items on the ground. It wasn't busy so I didn't understand the messiness of it at all. One employee did pick up a few items and place them in the full trash but when they blew away and out of out the trash, he did not retrieve items and instead left on the ground. 

The food was good. It was hot and fresh and definitely what you expect from a drive in. I ordered a cheeseburger for my son and was definitely surprised by how big it was. It was more than enough. The chicken tenders were tasty as well. My ribeye sandwich plate was not bad, not the greatest but A-Okay. 

I would return to South 21, just probably not this particular location."}
