{"text":"This place is horrible! We ordered here a lechon for New Year's Eve so disappointed, the taste  is so disgusting look like a rotten meat! We called the owner of this restaurant  to return and he said I  can give you only 50% off because that's our policy.  How  about the law here in Canada? Are you allowed to served this kind of food to your customer?  Anyway we brought it  back and gave it  to them.   I am NOT recommending this place! If  you see the name of this  restaurant B's Sizzling kitchen  RUN....go find another restaurant.."}
{"text":"The bad: the food was very bad, my family thought the cuts of meat were of mostly fat (BBQ skewers, sizzling adobo), they were not impressed with the quality nor the flavor of the dishes. We thought there was a lot of improvement to be done and maybe a change or improvement of skills in the kitchen in regards to flavor and quality of the food.  The good: the sisig fries are the only thing I would consider worth it there, the fries were overly oily/greasy but it is one app I would recommend.  The really bad: I was craving for halo-halo and ordered two and a lech flan, the server said it would be a while I said I will wait. 25 mins later after being impatient and bored of playing pool (only one stick available) I asked her again and she said she would check. She went to the back and nothing else was told to me. My family also asked and they got the same answer. After over 35 mins since I first asked for the dessert I decided to just ask for my bill and cancel the long awaited who-knows what-happened-to dessert.   I was extremely disappointed in not only the food but the lack of communication and honesty. If you cannot make the dessert please tell me that don't make me and my family wait for more than we should just to hunt you down and make us wait anymore.  It put a bad taste in our mouths literally and figuratively.   Next time we would all go to Max's Restaurant where quality, service, and confidence that menu items like dessert is available. Save your money and time and just go to Max for a real filipino experience that is well worth it.  I would give 0 stars if I could."}
{"text":"Nagbukas lang nung Paskwa Avril 1. Medyo bagu-bago pa.  Ok naman ang B's Sizzling Kitchen, di masama, ngunit di rin nakaka-wow.  kraniwan lang, ok lang.  Layo/lugar:  Pero kasi madalas kami Berto's na medyo malayo kumpar sa Sizzling Kitchen, buti alternatib ang Sizzling Kitchen.  Isang tawid lang sa Dollarama sa hilaga ng Dundas.  labz/loob: sa loob, puro kawayan ang mga dingding, di lang pulido ang pagka dikit kasi lambas ang mga glue.  May kutchon ang upuoan sa isang gilid.  labas, may sign na Sizzling Kitchen.  Kanen: Ito siguro pinaka importante sa lahat.  Tama lang ang serving size, at lasa.  Yung silog ay nakakabusog.  Yung chicharon na manok na binebenta nila ay maalat, at medyo sunog, imbes na light orange ang kulay, ay dark, napasobra ang pagluto, at ang alat, parang binuhos buong bote ng asin.  Nakakatulong na isawsaw sa suka pero sobra paring maalat, baka magkasakit sa bato.  Serbis: magalang naman ang servadoras nung nandun kami.  Hindi katagalan ang hintay.  Pero nung panahon nyon di naman busy, mga 7PM.  Gaya ng sinabi ko sa taas, karaniwan syang restaurant, buting alternatib sa Berto's, malapit sa Central Mississauga.  Pwede pang mag umuswag, maraming potential ang resto naito.  Babalik uli kami dito par subokan ang ibang putaje, na rekomend ng ibang kumain ditto."}
{"text":"I first visited this place with my girlfriends last weekend and i enjoyed it. So i decided to go back and bring my family today. We loved the sisig! It's a lot better from other Filipino restaurants we tried. There are numbers of silog option, portion is perfect and price is ok too. We also tried broth pork, kare-kare oxtail, calamari. The halo-halo is excellent! The service is very good too. They are friendly and easy to talk too if you have request to them. Place is not high-end look but well kept and clean.  I only give 4 star because of the location. But over all, worth going there."}
{"text":"Visited the new location near Hurontario & Dundas today. Had been craving for Filipino buffet since Quiapo-Quiapo closed, and while B's Sizzling is not a buffet restaurant, their Kamayan menu comes pretty close due to the huge portion & variety of dishes. I'm not fond of other people touching my food that's why I never join boodle fights, so I was ecstatic to find a Kamayan for 2 that I can just share with my husband listed on B's menu. Every single dish included was very tasty! My favourites are the chicken bbq that tasted like inasal, the lechon that comes with 3 different types of sauce, and the daing na bangus that even my husband enjoyed eating even though he usually doesn't like fish. The veggies were steamed just right, and the mango slices were the perfect complement to the dishes. Service was courteous and attentive without being intrusive. Interior was very clean and cozy. Loved the traditional decor and Filipino acoustic music playing in the background. Will definitely come back to try other dishes and also recommend to friends!"}
{"text":"I've visited this place a couple of times and I've been pretty pleased each time. The food is quite delicious, service is friendly and prompt, it's very clean, and has a pretty extensive menu. While it's located in a part of town I don't frequent too often (Dixie and Derry), it's located not too far away from major highways (just south of the 401), so the drive isn't too bad.  During one of my visits with my parents, we ordered the Filipino breakfasts (we got the tapsilog in particular, which was about $6.00), and the food came out very promptly. On other visits, we've also ordered the Lechon ($8.00) and some desserts like Buko Pandan and the Halo-Halo. The food is delicious, not too oily, and very flavourful. My only complaint would be that serving sizes are pretty small (the Lechon comes in a small basket), so I've knocked off one star. But other than, decent Filipino food at a reasonable price point.   While the food isn't the best Filipino food I've ever had (that distinction goes solely to my mother!), it's still quite delicious and is a good option if you want to eat out for Filipino food, particularly in the west end. We'll be back again one day."}
{"text":"the pansit is just noodles and with no meat. the sizzling milkfish is not boneless... which is hard to eat the sisig is VERY oily..  I am NOT recommending this place.."}
{"text":"I remember seeing pictures of the sisig fries on instagram and decided to try this place for breakfast next time I'm visiting the parental back home.   I was worried they were closed Sunday at 9am, especially after the big Pacquiao fight but they were open! We were the first ones there too. One thing I found kind of surprising was the super loud rnb mixtape over the sound system. It was a good mix but way too early for that. I almost felt bad for my parents.   We ordered 4 breakfasts and all of them cost 5.99. I ordered lechon kawali with egg and rice with was off the menu I believe it was 7.99 instead.   The breakfast was good. We were offered water and coffee and served promptly. Two additional things I took mental note of:  1. Really small servings of tocino. Compared to the rice ratio,  it was like a parent took tocino and chopped it up for a kid's plate.   2. We had to ask for more coffee and ketchup. My dad also requested to get the eggs well done and they happily did so.   Not sure why this place one got 1 star reviews, it's not a bad place and the food is pretty good. I would come back and try the dinner menu and update my review."}
{"text":"Did you guys know that they have relocated at Hurontario and Dundas st?? Their Derry  & Dixie location is no longer open anymore.  Every time I go here, I get Salisbury steak ($11.99+ tax) This meal is so goooood & is very rich in flavour. But sometimes, it is a hit or miss. Coz' I often times get a burnt burger which tastes bitter. Meeeeh.   But overall, still good. In addition, I find their LUNCH SPECIAL hilarious. They have lunch specials served up UNTIL 12PM ONLY. Lol. Then you gotta add +$2 if you wanted to order it on a later time. Menu definitely got pricier."}
{"text":"Fried milkfish. Eggs. Garlic rice. All just amazing. Solid and weird breakfast spot in an even stranger location. Friendly staff, and actually decent coffee too!"}
{"text":"Another favorite filipino place located in mississauga.   Get the sisig fries, it's the bomb!!!!!!  Also tried the lechon, bbq on a stick and the batchoy. All delish!!!  Also the owners are super nice. It's like your family in this place.   If ur ever in mississauga. Must come here!"}
