{"text":"It feels like they hired staff without any hospitality or restaurant experience whatsoever. We had drinks at the bar in the evening and then tried again for breakfast the next morning. It's not terrible but if you are wanting a nice experience with great service, this may not be the place."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! went today for lunch and the flank steak salad was FABULOUS! Word is one of the chefs from Chopped runs the kitchen! Delicious! come here instead of the Gladly you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"I came here for Valentine's Day with my wife and at first I was disappointed because they were only serving there V-Day menu. This disappointed  however was short lived. This place exceeded my expectations. The food and drinks were awesome as was the staff. I definitely plan on coming back to experience the rest of the menu. The atmosphere was very chill and modern with good music. This place helped make a very happy Valentine's Day for my me and my wife."}
{"text":"Had quite a few issues this AM. Very badly burnt French Toast after not coming out with the order. No syrup either. Had to wait until everyone finished their meals and then was served a poor meal. Not good. I ate it because I didn't have a choice. Cheese was also not on the scrambled eggs as requested. Coffee was very hard to get seconds on. They were busy given the holiday but honestly not too busy. Overall, our party of four had a number of issues and while our server was apologetic, for the price, we had a lot higher expectations. Long wait for the check. We were very nice, too. 2 stars vs. 1 stars because my wife's potatoes were some of the best I have ever tasted in my life. Bursting with flavor. Everyone deserves a second chance, I will return, in due time, and update my review."}
{"text":"We stayed at the Camby and had the Artizen for breakfast twice and dinner once which allowed us to experience delicious food, beautiful ambience and exemplary service! The manager as well as the chef came over and made sure everything was enjoyed. True quality service with an amazing cuisine, we will be back! Our stay at the resort was nothing short of amazing as well!"}
{"text":"Pass on Artizen, overpriced and not that great.
My guy and I went to Artizen for lunch.  This restaurant must still be trying to find its culinary voice.  The menu oscillates from Mexican to Asian with a third of the dishes containing Sriracha.  The wine list is neurotic and overpriced.
I finally settled on the chicken sandwich.  After I removed 3 inches of iceberg lettuce, the sandwich was reasonable.  Adding drama with iceberg?  There was caramel popcorn on my spinach salad.  Weird.
The decor is odd.  Cheap, ugly copper pipes are the centerpiece. 
The bright spot of our experience was our waitress.  She was kind and well spoken.
The experience was just not worth the money. $100 lunch?  
Disappointed for sure."}
{"text":"sam was awesome! very friendly, very attentive and very personal. showed us a great time with a smile on his face and made our first time here a great experience! will be back!"}
{"text":"This is more about the Bar than the Restaurant.  I was here recently on a business conference and met some colleagues in the Bar upon my arrival for Happy Hour.  Nice, lively, and high energy.  The HH prices were excellent.  There were four of us that only met for one drink and the bill was only $12.00.  We all looked at the other tables at the appetizers which also looked very appealing and well done.  Flash forward......I've been favoring slightly injured ankle, so instead of going out with the crowd the next evening I decided to eat dinner at the bar and watch some basketball.  The lounge area was maybe half full at about 6:30 PM and the bar was less than that.  I figure the HH crowd was leaving.  After taking a seat at the bar and noticing 3 bartenders (2 male 1 female) and a bar back I waited at minimum 10 minutes while they all passed by me, looked at me and didn't acknowledge my existence. The boys were too busy cracking jokes with what appeared to be locals sitting next to me. Finally, the girl came over and took my drink order. Great Martini!  It came time for a 2nd and obviously they have never been trained to offer when they see an empty glass.  Finally got the second and it was the first time I've seen a Martini served without an olive or some kind of garnish depending on what you like.  I'll stop here about the bar as you can see the service was non-existent.  I ordered an appetizer and decided to leave without dinner.  Too bad as I was really looking forward to dinner after seeing a few dishes breeze by me.  They also had a great Singer/Guitar player that I enjoyed immensely.  He got a $5 tip even though I could not find a tip jar for him.  Enough said, I'm starting to ramble.  Bottom Line?  I left disappointed, was going to probably spend $150.  After contemplating the next day, I will probably be back for one more try on my next business trip as the food and the menu really intrigued me.  But if the service is the same that will be it.  Two stars as I only got to try one appetizer.  I get the feeling that it is inconsistent depending on staff of the day.  Sorry but for now you need a manager to supervise the bar."}
{"text":"The Artizen has a stunning decor and a welcoming staff.
They were prepared for us immediately. We had a very comfortable table in the garden area particularly appropriate for the two keiki in our group. The buffet offerings were extraordinary. Each of the four food stations was creative and artistically designed. We loved the fact that they displayed some items we don't usually see. It was my first time trying dried fruit forbidden rice and my husband is requesting that I find the ingredients when we return home to Hawaii.

By the time we left the Artizen the restaurant was almost full. The service remained diligent throughout our visit and the noise level was always pleasant. My particular gratitude was extended to the bartender who squeezed a fresh peach pur√©e for my Bellini. My grandchildren were most impressed with the \"yummy \" cookies decorated as Easter eggs.

The Leas family is very grateful to have had such a lovely place to unite on Easter Day. We all go separate ways tomorrow but we have fond memories of this morning's celebration. We appreciate the efforts you made to make this possible."}
{"text":"For being open only one hour I was really surprised by the Artizen.  This is the restaurant in the newly renovated Camby hotel, which was formerly the Ritz Carlton. 

We were greeted by Jackie, who knew the menu very well, and was very illustrative in describing her favorites. We heard about the new theme of the property. Her attention to detail was bar none, pointing out the camel sculpture in front. We took a couple of seats at the bar to watch the restaurant action.

Kevin created a couple of really wonderful signature drinks. I had the Stage Collins, my wife had the Phoenix Smash. Both were tasty and we enjoyed watching the creation process. Again, I'm surprised at how good the service is for their first day. Clearly the soft open, which I assume happened, was time well spent.

Not hungry but wanting to try something we shared the roasted Thai curried cauliflower. The service was prompt and it was really tasty. I'm looking forward to coming back of the property and trying the very interesting mix of food on the menu. I can see myself eating our way around the menu to find my favorites... because they all look so tasty"}
{"text":"This restaurant was amazing. Top notch food and service. Layered complex flavors. The cornbread was to die for! Great server named Rick who accommodated our very large party."}
{"text":"Fabulous... Great service great food

Scallops can be hit or miss... This was off the chart good scallops"}
{"text":"Visited Artizen restaurant week and had a great time. The ambiance, the food, the service were great! The teamwork of the staff was also impressive. The female manager Jacky came by and suggested we tried the bee's knees cocktail which was great. One of the other young manager from Togo (?) was a joy to talk to when he visited our table. See you soon!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were looking for restaurants close to us on the internet and came across Artizen! it got good reviews so we thought we would try it. I am so glad we did. As soon as you walk in you are overwhelmed by the unique beautiful decor. The dark blue walls and copper fixtures are absolutely stunning. 
Jeff, our waiter, was intelligent, warm and funny. You could tell he really believes in the menu and loves his job. We started out with the corn bread and sun chokes. Both were amazing. Our entrees were delectable. Unfortunately we did not have room for dessert but next time we will make sure we leave room. On the way out Wesley, the manager, made sure we were happy and I was pleased to tell him \"we will be back soon\"."}
{"text":"Amazing dinner experience, modern comfortable ambiance scallops were best I ever had, desert was to die for and the service was perfect. Best food ever will definitely be back for more"}
{"text":"My husband took me here for Valentines Day and we were skeptical because we read other reviews however this place was phenomenal!!!! We had a special menu for Valentine's Day and the food was amazing!!! The short rib was my absolute favorite! The ambiance was very very nice! They had a gentleman singing and he did a great job! My hubby loved his drinks and food! We will definitely come back highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Had a great time checking out the Camby and trying out the brunch menu at Artizen. The food was great, restaurant atmosphere was really cool, and the service was fast and friendly. The hostess, Jackie, was welcoming and she remembered us from when we once ate at T. Cooks at the Royal Palms, where she used to work. Will definitely come back for dinner!"}
{"text":"Brunch was delicious, started with fresh raspberry, strawberry orange juice. They brought out an adorable tray with a biscuit and delicious marmalade! Such a treat for this momma on a getaway! I decided on the southwest quesadilla and it was a big portion (I could barely eat half). Tasty and the tortilla was soft and crispy, just how it should be IMO. The customer service was the best I have ever experienced. Hands down. I would come back just for the service. I hope to try this location for dinner."}
{"text":"I was debating between two or three stars and I finally decided on three stars.

My roommate and I went on a Thursday night for Restaurant Week. This was our first time to Artizen and we were absolutely wowed by the decor. Absolutely dramatic and modern design sensibility that we both loved. We were seated by a very pleasant hostess who ended up taking our order because our server was too busy to stop by. 

We had the burrata salad, which was amazing. The roasted strawberries were incredibly savory while the burrata was delicious. I had the pork osso bucco, which was tender, but lacking in flavor. The chorizo cheddar stuffed dates were fantastic and much tastier than the pork. My roommate had the tagliatelle, which was unmemorable. For dessert, we shared the lemon brulee pie (tart and delicious) and the chocolate indulgence of the day (a disappointing chocolate mousse). The salad was the highlight of our meal, which isn't really what I was hoping for. 

My biggest annoyance of the night was that when our bill came, the server had already added a full 20% tip onto our bill. He let us know the tip was already included so we wouldn't accidentally tip again, but we were both stunned. We are a party of two. Why was a tip automatically added? We didn't dispute the tip, but we should have. If they have an auto tip policy, I didn't notice it being disclosed on the menu anywhere. The tip should be up to our discretion when it's just a party of two. Auto-adding a tip to our bill really left a bad taste at the end of the meal. 

I might come back again to check out the bar, but I'll probably skip on Artizen. There are many other places to explore and return to first."}
{"text":"We decided to give this place a try while we were staying at the hotel and I am so glad we did!

One order of beets with goat cheese, lemon and some type of cumin pepita brittle were amazing! I wanted to order more, but decided we had to try a few other dishes. The white cheddar cornbread had honey and smoked pistachio butter. The combination of flavors were delightful. Main course was the citrus steelhead and again this was a hit. 

I love the creativity of the dishes and all the flavor combinations were incredible! Our server was so fantastic (I wish I could remember his name). He was so helpful and fun to chat with. 

Great ambiance, good music, nice selection of drinks and delicious food. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Best place to eat ever! I got married at the Camby and this Returant was the main reason why.  People still call me up raving about the food at my wedding and whenever I come it never disappoints.  Just had another, my 4th great dinner with my girlfriends here tonight and the food was yet again perfect.  It's not a meal you can eat without understanding an appreciating food for its differences.  The tastes are always unique and for a more international pallet, if you have basic tastes you like in food then you won't have fun here.  It's for those who like to explore."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I have ever had. Yummy! Artizen Burger, highly recommend it if you are a burger lover. Got my rare, and it was perfect. 
Other dish was the Salmon. Also very good, nice portion and cooked perfectly.
Looking forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"This place is been on my must go places for a while have to admit I was a little disappointed this is definitely a pretty Swanky place but other than that not much beer selection very poor do we have like 4 beers on draft I think their food selection is small which is fine if they made everything great but I didn't really have anything all that spectacular start off with the cheese and charcuterie which was okay I like the jam and the one if the sheep's cheese o my wife like the chorizo the best I wouldn't order it again I ordered the New York it was average at best this was missing some seasoning or something it was cooked exactly how I wanted it which was good but no real flavor and a little tough to thanks a lot for the creme brulee was not good 9f egg not enough vanilla it just tastes like vanilla pudding with sugar burn on top that wasn't even hard it's not sure if it was sitting out for a while or what now our server was friendly but not very attentive pretty much checked out it was funny cuz it was his last night there you could tell that he did not want to be there Dan truly know the menu very well either definite place to hang out at the bar though looks like that pretty in mixed drinks from the menu definitely just your average hotel bar restaurant probably won't go back"}
{"text":"So, you get a reservation at 10:30am for Sunday brunch, the restaurant is COMPLETELY EMPTY, and we were told that they only had patio seating even though we had reservations. The patio was SOAKING WET from the misters. Unfortunately, I can't speak to the food and/or service as we weren't even seated with a reservation. When I called to speak to the manager about this, it went straight to voicemail as well."}
{"text":"Came in for happy hour/dinner worn out from flying in for work. Waiter was wonderful and perky, manager checked on me with just as much perkiness. Food was served quickly and hot and delicious. Drinks were speedy and tasty too."}
{"text":"I discovered Artizen during this past Restaurant Week and it is a \"find\" that is very much worthy of great compliments. Contrary to what I have found in other restaurants during their this \"Week\" their fare is amazingly unimpressive Artizen, on the other hand, compared well with the best restaurants in New York City in which I lived for many years. 

I highly recommend that they include their Restaurant Week's dishes as a core for their regular menu which currently does not include them.  Their Tuna Tatare was exquisite as was their duck confit and their filet. Their staff is astoundingly knowledgeable, friendly, and professional. Specifically, I want to commend Jeff who is as fine a waiter as I have found anywhere in the world and Wesley whose knowledge of wine and ability to make customers feel comfortable is second to none"}
{"text":"We stayed at the Camby for a quick weekend getaway , and this restaurant/ bar is located inside. Let me begin with the vibe of the artizen, so beautiful, modern it's truly a hidden gem! The grilled octopus is a must try !!! The staff was incredibly welcoming, Alex our bartender was such a great host and made such incredible drinks and guided my husband to some awesome whiskeys thank you for such a great time!!"}
{"text":"The page was pretty empty for a Saturday night, but the staff was very friendly and the food was delicious."}
{"text":"I love it when I find a new go to spot! This restaurant is exceptional because of the food and staff. The ambience is nice and calming. I've grown tired of all the new restaurants with nicely plated food that is tasteless. I ordered the Scallops and my friends had the lamb chops and Red Snapper. Not one morsel was left in any of our plates. The portion sizes are just right. Not the \"I'm going to give you a huge portion to cover up the nasty taste\" value size. And because the entree size was perfect, it allowed room for dessert which was fabulous. Creme Br√ªl√©e , Mango glazed cheesecake and chocolate mousse type dessert. All very delicious and not overly sweet. The staff was extremely friendly and knowledgeable about the food being serviced. Can't wait for my next visit and to share Artizen with more friends and family."}
{"text":"Amazing service! The server Nicole went above and beyond! A must go to if your in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"I had the complimentary Marriott Platinum breakfast here - the coupon doesn't mention you can use it for $15 of food if you'd rather instead of the continental breakfast, but the waiter did, which was really nice.  I had oatmeal and a scone, perfectly acceptable, with almond milk (nice touch).
It was a good breakfast."}
{"text":"We dined during restaurant week and selected from the special menu. The food was delicious and unique. The carrot bisque was amazing. The trout was perfectly cooked. Dessert choices of either tres leches cake or flan were winners. Our server was Jeff who was knowledgeable, attentive and friendly. A great dining choice. Note that there is complimentary valet parking but the nearby garage is not validated parking."}
{"text":"This could have been one of the worst meals I've had in a long time.  Went there with a few other people.  For appetizers we had the potatoes and the sun chokes.  Both were ok.  I was not very hungry so I ordered the gem salad with Caesar dressing.  It was inedible.  It was drowning in cheese and dressing that had too much garlic.  I also ordered the brocolini which was barely edible.  

Others ordered the pork chop and steelhead.  They all seemed to have enjoyed their meals.  This is the first time I've ever had a salad that I would categorize as inedible.  There were also very few things on the menu that were appealing.  Other than hotel guests, I cant imagine anyone else coming here."}
{"text":"The food was great, but it cannot make up for the rude service.  The hostess was nice. The server treated us like it was an annoyance to help us. When we asked for a menu they gave us one for the whole table.  We later asked for dessert menu and again he only brought us one for the whole table. They will not validate for the parking garage.
The server also discouraged us from making any changes or substitutions with a dinner such as removing the bacon or substituting a vegetable."}
{"text":"Good ambiance. Passable Easter brunch choices. Horrible waiter - Tim. Pompous attitude. Disappeared often. Reach across guests to serve coffee. Got better service from other employees we flagged down to find him or serve us. VERY EXPENSIVE. Ostentatious in presentation Labeled food presentations \"artesian cheeses\" rather than types \"pastry display \" (duh!) rather that what they were etc. No directions as to the fact that egg choices were outside as were the carving board which consIsted only of one cut of beef. Messed up our reservation. Booked 9:15 when brunch started at 10. Had incorrect number of guests in party. Handed us a la carte men yes. If you are in the area FORGET IT."}
{"text":"I loved the taste of everything we got the lox and avocado toast and chilaquilas and bare in mind it was a Saturday brunch out of season but I asked for a traditional Irish coffee and the young bartender gave me a bastardized version so I just got a gin and soda and my eggs were over done but overall can't complain since We was the only one there"}
{"text":"Came here for Valentine's dinner when they had a prixe-fix 4 course menu and it was AMAZING. I'm not sure what their normal menu is like, but their special Valentine's menu was truly one of the best meals I can remember. For each course they had a vegetarian option, which is what I got, and these were outstanding. I had a delicious salad, an asparagus and egg appetizer, the best risotto I've ever had (I don't usually care for risotto, but this was so flavorful and not too heavy or mushy), and creme br√ªl√©e. I also had a wonderful herbal gin cocktail. I was delighted by not only my entire meal, but the gorgeous decor of this restaurant. I love the dark teal walls, modern brass fixtures, and intricate moulding. This place was so wonderful and I hope to be back again. Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"We went to Artizen, located off the lobby inside The Camby Hotel, the former Ritz Carlton and it was excellent. The made for sharing entrees, sides and starters created a sense of community and provided an excellent tasting menu. Chef Dushyant Singh flavor profiles and unique combination of ingredients was spot on. We highly recommend the chicken, carne asada, sweet potatoes and Thai flavored cauliflower with S'Mores to complete the meal. Try out this new restaurant in the Camelback corridor, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This comment is strictly in regards to service, I didn't end up staying for drinks because of the rude waiter. Happy hour is supposed to be from 4 to 6. Got there a few minutes before 6 and I asked for a happy hour drink menu and was told happy hour was over because his clock said it was already 6. I initially thought he was jocking and being a friendly bartender and was later shocked to find out he was serious. It wasn't 6 yet! Decided not to stay after those bad vibes.  Decor did look great and the hotel stay was good as well."}
{"text":"Service in the restaurant lacked attention to detail, no proper communication from our server about wait times. We waited 45 minutes for our drinks and decided to leave for another restaurant (that was a lot more busy) with better service. At the time we were in Artizen, it was a Saturday and they were not busy - there was a large table of 12, our table of 10 and a total of approximately 10 other customers throughout the entire restaurant (the restaurant is huge). Point being that I would never recommend Artizen to another person if they didn't have at least a few hours and a lot of patience to spare. Not to mention the prices are ridiculous! Way over priced. Giving two stars because I've been here once before and the flavor of the food was good."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the ambiance and venue at the Camby. It's definitely a well designed hotel with a modern urban feel.  The manager at the Artizen made me an excellent martini and the blue cheese olives were clutch! I gave it 4 stars because I felt like it took longer than it should have to get service but everything was very good :)"}
{"text":"We stayed at the Camby (the hotel where this restaurant is located). We had drinks at the bar several different times, with great service! Some bartenders had better hygiene than others.  I love the ambiance here....it's dark and classy with a sophisticated feel. 

We came down for breakfast and it was delicious! The service was spot on and 5 star. The food was perfect and such a great way to start the day. Darn good coffee too!"}
{"text":"I went there for happy hour. There wasn't an extensive food menu for happy hour, but a variety of drinks. I had the nachos which were good. The service was great and the manager (?) stopped by to check in. The decor is very nice and modern as well."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is VERY modern. The staff is friendly.
The food however is just OK. Nothing spectacular or extra special.
The West Coast Charcuterie & Cheese Tasting was very strange. You got several pieces of meats, but there was only one of each and it was a small piece. Then there were dollops of random cheeses. The issue is a cheese board is meant to share and be enjoyed by the table... it is really hard with this one. And at $15, not worth it. The cheeses and meats were nothing exceptional or unique. 
The wine selection is pretty decent.

If you are in to new trendy places, then this is worth checking out, but don't have too high of expectations for the food."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch and ordered their burger.  Although it was 16.00 was one of the best burgers I have ever had with perfectly cooked fries.  The bun they use was a challah bun that set this off.  Definitely will be getting it again"}
{"text":"I came here with a TravelZoo voucher and had a great experience! My boyfriend and I had the veal cheeks, risotto, steak frites, and creme br√ªl√©e. All were delicious, service was super attentive, great design and style of the restaurant! One tip is they validate for the valet parking, but not if you park in the garage! Overall great meal and vibes for a special night out- we will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Decided to hit the new Artizen for date night & check out their restaurant week menu. Oh. My. Everything was SO good. We had the chilled sweet pea soup with fresh crab, house made burrata with stone fruit, an amazing house salad with caramel popcorn (!), diver scallops & lamb chops. Ah-mazing! We are 1000% coming back-- probably to check out their Sunday brunch next!"}
{"text":"I love The Camby -- Happy to know that it's part of the Marriott's Autograph Collection. Very chic Lobby. Enjoyed the walk to the Artizen. Love the varied choices on the menu. Since I'm working on my Size 4 figure for Summer, I decided to try the Camby Tortilla Soup. Slightly differ take on spices -- I liked! Artizen salad is light and tasty. I had a bite of Selma's Chorizo Torta and it was AMAZING! 

It's great to see this grand property up and running again. I will definitely make this a fave in the area rather than dining arcoss at the Biltmore Fashion Square. Cheers***"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and it's been an adventure both times. Chef Dushyant Singh is incredibly creative. He combines the technique and execution of any world-class chef with his own ingenuity. The food is modern American with a southwest twist. The menu is ever changing on a seasonal basis. Flavors are very well-balanced. You are guaranteed to experience flavor combinations that you have never even thought about.

The foie gras is served with pickled blackberries and a tamarind mustard, which is just incredible. The combination of salty, spicy, and sweet is perfectly balanced. I had the filet mignon feature on my 2nd visit and it was perfectly cooked, served with a fig potato puree that was like eating delicious air. For dessert, the coffee and doughnuts are a must have. Not an actual doughnut, but a delicious creamy foam that has the essence of the sweet pastry and a cup of coffee. Chef Singh turns food into an art form every time he gets into the kitchen."}
{"text":"I was so excited to see the new Camby Hotel and was not disappointed - they did a great job renovating the former, tired Ritz Carlton space.  I decided to meet a client here for lunch on Friday and we had a great experience - beautiful dining room, great menu and exceptional service.  I enjoyed the special shrimp tacos with a side of guacamole, salsa and homemade chips - yummy!  This will definitely be added to the business lunch rotation."}
{"text":"Our son took us for the Mothers Day brunch and it was outstanding as usual... Great atmosphere, busy, great menu."}
{"text":"What can I say.... The ambiance is modern yet comfortable. The food is unique and very tasty. The desert.... Well that took it to a whole other level. We had a group of 7, so we tried them all and we loved every one of them. We're talking over the top delicious. The service was top notch right from the start. They saw we had a celebration and offered us their private room immediately. The servers were spot on and timely. The soloist added nicely to the ambiance as well. A great experience from start to finish.  We've been to many great restaurants and have great expectations and this time they were both met and exceeded.
We'll be back anytime we're in the area. Bravo!!"}
{"text":"Love the interior design! The blue and copper really works well together. 
There were a good amount of people in the restaurant on a weekday morning, but we were seated right away. 
I felt like although convenient since we were staying at the Camby, it was a bit on the pricey side. However, both the hubby and I enjoyed our meals.
I ordered the make your own omelette opting to take out the chorizo and goat cheese, keeping everything else. I think the avocado was possibly left out of my omelette, it was yummy nonetheless. It had plenty of meat and veggies and the eggs were fluffy. The fingering potatoes were surprisingly good. 
My husband got the all American and interestingly enough, appeared to have more eggs than me! It wasn't able to eat it all. I also didn't finish my toast.
Service was attentive as I think we had 4 different people check in with us. Two ladies that I think their sole purpose was refilling water glasses.
I would be up to trying the restaurant for other meals based on our experience."}
{"text":"The Artizen (In the Camby Hotel) is my favorite breakfast spot here in Phoenix. The food is very fresh, creative, and made with care and attention. The staff are attentive and very friendly. I had a great server, Whitney, who was just awesome! She double checked the ingredients when I had a question about sugar, and helped me come up with a creative breakfast choice. She also let me know about fun events in the area. A great breakfast, I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Very good!!! I had the salmon with root vegetables. Great flavor!!! Hit the spot.for dessert I got a moose with apple cinnamon donut hole toppers. That was super YUM!!!!"}
{"text":"I stayed at The Camby Hotel and the place is the host restaurant.. I attended the Sunday brunch and it was really good.. Wasn't over crowded, good service, food came out pretty quick... I ordered the French toast with fresh berries. Really good and hot! They messed up one of my guest orders and corrected it and took it off the bill. So the customer service there is really good and friendly."}
{"text":"The bar scene at night is great and the bartenders are attentive but to my surprise returning in the morning was ridiculous. There's only so much neglect you can take as a customer. 30 minutes of attempting to flag someone down is disappointing especially for a place as nice as this."}
{"text":"This is a cool, hip hidden gem in Phoenix. The staff is very friendly and upbeat, and the burgers are by far the best burgers in Phoenix! I always go back for more."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Neil Diamond - The Art Of Love)

She said, it's time to try out Artizen
She said, we're gonna eat brunch at Artizen
A place you never Yelped, a place that lives somewhere inside The Camby

I know I'm on a eating journey I won't forget
I know I had to to wear a Bow and yet I always could before
I had to, if I wanted to be Bo-Bites


Happy National Bo-Tie day everyday.....I wish!  The Artizen is located inside the Camby hotel; and ritzy hot spot for locals and visitors to the valley. 

My buddies and I attended the Artizen on National Bowtie day since there was a special bowtie fashion show and the Lamborghini club was there to show off their fancy cars.  

The place was hoping with live music and drinks flowing.  We didn't join the group, but instead went straight to the restaurant to start our brunch.  We started with their well known blackberry bacon pancakes.  I thought it was good, but nothing too flashy since, blackberry waffles, with bacon atop and syrup; you can't go wrong!  For my entree I shot for the BLT benedict, bacon, arugula, heirloom tomato, poached eggs, and chipotle hollandaise sauce on top.  It was served with side of fries.  Overall, I enjoyed the salty bite and texture of the bacon along with the hint of bitterness from the arugula.  The sweetness of the tomatoes messed well with the spicy chipotle hollandaise sauce.  Not a bad start, but my favorite was the Huevos Rancheros, but buddy ordered.  Crunchy from the hard tortilla shell and covered with Mexican chorizo, salsa, mashed beans, avocado, and eggs; this is how Huevos Rancheros should be made all the time!

In the end, our visit to Artizen was a delight with fashion, drinks, and food!  A culmination of what I what Bo Biting is all about in my books; lovely Sunday Brunch date with good people dressed up and enjoying each others company! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Excellent in every way. We took advantage of the TravelZoo deal they had which is well worth it. Having dined in the space when it was part of the Ritz Carlton hotel, what a nice change. The decor inside is inviting and comfortable. The music was not loud at all which is a nice change from all of the new restaurants because you can actually have a conversation.  We enjoyed all of our food. Very well prepared and flavorful. The tuna appetizer, yum! The steelhead salmon entree and lamb chops were out of this world. Top that off with carrot cake and you have a great dinner. It wasn't that busy which was nice. Service was excellent from the wait staff to the manager. I look forward to going back again and trying something else on the menu."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, good food. Would definitely come back. Only downside is valet parking seems to be only option and can be slow if hotel is busy."}
{"text":"I always feel badly writing 1 star reviews, but this place really disappointed.

- We went for breakfast on a Sunday around 10:45am. Although the place was pretty empty, we waited an unusually long time before being seated. One server walked by and just smiled, two others just looked at us from behind the bar where they were working together to make a coffee drink. We were about to leave when a waitress finally came over and said she wasn't sure where the hostess was, but would seat us. The water, when it finally arrived, came in a dirty bottle. And the silverware had food on it. Although our waitress was very friendly, she seemed to be frantically running around and failing to keep up with patron needs. At the table of four seated next to us, two guests got their food while the other two sat watching them eat until the rest of the meals were delivered. After sitting with empty water glasses for too long, one of them men got up and took a bottle off a table nearby that was vacated, but covered with dirty plates still waiting to be cleared.

Food
- I ordered the asparagus and avocado toast with poached eggs ($14). The single slice of bread came topped with 3 spears of asparagus and avocado that had a slightly dark color which makes me think it was made a few hours ago, not fresh. One of the poached eggs was overcooked. It is served in an odd shaped shallow bowl with an uneven rim that made eating messy because each time I set my knife down, it slid into the plate.
- My husband ordered the smoked salmon stack ($17). A bit pricey for the amount of food. The tomatoes lacked any flavor and though the presentation was pretty, cutting through the layers of egg/salmon/bagel chip caused things to slide all over.
- The crepes with mascarpone and strawberries ($9) were disappointing. The crepes had a rubbery texture, the strawberry filling was skimpy, and the mascarpone would have benefited from some seasoning.
- My husband's diet coke was $3.25 and our waitress was too busy with all the other tables to come back for a second refill.

Overall, cannot recommend this place as a brunch destination. Sorry!"}
{"text":"I was taken here for my birthday.  When the driver stopped in front of the Camby Hotel (restaurant is connected to the hotel), the valets were there but did not open our doors...
We proceeded to the restaurant door entrance and the wait staff made the hostess aware we were there. The hostess greeted us and verified this was for a birthday celebration and proceeded to seat us.  

There was a delay from the time we were seated to being greeted by a server.  So much so that I told my companion I would only wait 3 more minutes before leaving.  A minute after I said that, the waiter came.

The food is delicious.  The portions were small.

Other than, the hostess mentioning when seating us, \"Happy Birthday\", there was no acknowledgement from the waiter that the dinner was a special occasion. 

My companion made mention of this prior to leaving the restaurant.  Someone did contact us later that night to explain what occurred and offered to make up for the misunderstanding by offering us to come back for a different event that they host on Fridays (if Im not mistaken) but there is no making up for a missed opportunity to make someone's birthday matter.

I chose this establishment but will not make the mistake of wanting to celebrate any special occasion here in the future.

As well, when we left the lobby of the hotel, there was litter on the ground in front of the hotel and the valets weren't busy.  They were inside the hotel lobby gathered around the hostess stand.  It's just not what I expected for this area."}
{"text":"We stayed at The Camby and ate here twice out of convenience. Service was great, food was salty. The first day, the egg white omelette was stellar. The second day, we came for Christmas brunch and everything was just okay - prime rib was underwhelming, crab lump omelette was bland and the avocado asparagus toast was cold (expected the asparagus to be warm). Overall, it was okay if you're staying here, but I wouldn't come out of my way to eat here, especially with all the restaurants nearby."}
{"text":"I ate lunch here with my family for my mom's birthday and we all loved it.  The crunchy brussels sprouts were amazing and we really enjoyed the Oaxaca cheese fondue.  The main dishes were equally as good and our service was great.  I would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Great food impeccable service. I am so impressed! Definitely recommend! The Brussels are to die for."}
{"text":"I was in the Camby for over a week on business and had the pleasure of befriending the bar staff and firing up a conversation with Chef Kyle.  ... which led to a bit of glutinous punishment.  These guys know their craft, and they love those that appreciate it.  

Michael and the guys run a tight ship at the bar.  They know their mixology and how to treat their guests.  They're fun, easy to engage, quick, and always ready to guide you to a good drink.  Best bartenders in the city? .. without a question.

Where the bar and waitstaff set the stage, Chef Kyle delivers the magic.  The guy loves the creative process and really delivers the goods.  He had the Washington Redskins in the back of the hotel while I was there, apparently eating everything he and his staff could cook.. as fast as they could cook it.  Yet, with all that chaos he still managed to send out a few specially prepared dishes for this old foodie.  Bone marrow br√ªl√©e on a seafood and corn chowder.. and the meal went on from there.  The man has skill that is only barely on display in the restaurant's menu.. which means catering events are sure to stun in this hotel.  As phenomenal as the menu is, the possibilities are truly endless.  

Do yourself a favor.. make some friends at the Camby/Artizen, and enjoy their exceptional artistry."}
{"text":"I had their version of a tuna melt. It was very flavorful and fresh. I highly recommend lunch. Instead of fries I got a small salad. They were a little slow in service but they make up for it in quality."}
{"text":"Excellent date night location, the food was excellent and the presentation was great. Wait staff was super friendly and very attentive. Went for dinner and the tuna crudo was very fresh and yummy. Ordered the steak frites and sea bass, both were cooked superbly and seasoned beautifully. Will be back for another date night soon."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant!!  The Brussel sprouts are some of the best I've had. They do a different recipe for dinner and lunch. The lunch recipe is outstanding!  The roasted carrots are amazing!  Short ribs are a little dry but super tasty. The food is really good!! Love."}
{"text":"Cool vibe, delicious drinks. The real stars are the staff! Great service! Ask the bartender for something special, and be delighted!"}
{"text":"Started with a couple of fine cocktails and a fabulous salad. Then two tasty fish entrees- the roasted Bronzino was not a large dish but is priced accordingly. Actually the dish/plate was huge, but not the amount of food. Just right though w/o leftovers.
I should mention that my husband was a bit distracted by another restaurant guest: LeBron James! No autographs allowed (I tried).
We recommend this brand new restaurant, but thought the dessert offerings should be more upscale."}
{"text":"Artizen is a trendy little restaurant attached to the The Camby hotel, which is located in the Camelback Esplanade plaza that's directly across the street from Biltmore Fashion Park. After studying the menu and doing some research, it sounded like it would be a good fit for our taste, so we finally decided to give them a try.

Honestly, the Esplanade plaza has always kind of weirded me out. Even on a Saturday night, it never feels crowded or lively. Most of the surrounding businesses are usually closed, while most of the parked cars that clog the garage are visiting the AMC Dine-In Theater. Be sure to use their complimentary valet service and avoid parking in the garage and paying the fees for doing so.

The d√©cor itself is very sleek, dim, and laid back. In fact, I really like their setup. My girlfriend and I were able to be seated at a giant \"mob booth\" during prime dining hours on a Saturday night. No reservation necessary, as the place wasn't really that busy from what we could see.

If you study the menu, you'll quickly see that this place is all about emphasizing locally sourced ingredients that are seasonally appropriate. As another reviewer pointed out, you're probably better off looking at the menu on their website as opposed to studying Yelp pictures. Many items you see posted are no longer available, which can be a bit deceiving to some.

We started off with their white cheddar cornbread, which uses Hayden flourmills cornmeal (always a good source), honeycomb, and smoked pistachio butter. This was, by far, the best thing that we ate all night. The cheddar was not overpowering (a la Tuck Shop waffles) and the additional ingredients created a lovely combination that works incredibly well together. Furthermore, we ordered their carmelized fennel risotto, which includes basil mint ricotta and vegetables. This wasn't too bad, although my girlfriend absolutely loathed the basil mint, claiming it tasted like some kind of potent shampoo you'd buy at a health food store. 

For main dishes, there really isn't much to pick from. Nothing really stood out to me, so I just ended up ordering a burger and fries, while my girlfriend chose the steak frites based on a recommendation from the server. The burger was sandwiched between a decent poppy challah bun, but didn't really jump out to me as something that I couldn't easily obtain elsewhere. The fries were just standard. My girlfriend's steak frites included some very crispy potatoes. She felt the dish was fine, but not quite worth the 29-dollar asking price.

Service was a bit shoddy. While our server was polite, he often disappeared for long periods of time and seemed too busy hobnobbing with nearby tables. We had to wait a good 30 minutes of just sitting there blankly before he eventually asked us if we wanted a dessert. Choices were limited, with nothing particularly standing out as something that was a \"must-have.\" We reluctantly went for this item called the Lil' Drum, which is basically a drumstick with a beefed-up presentation. It's an ice cream cone that contains some kind of popcorn and caramel flavored ice cream that had more of a sorbet-like texture. I can't place my finger on it, but it just seemed like a very odd choice for a restaurant and something that would be more appropriate for an ice cream truck.

Reviewing this place is tough, because I'm all for chef-driven creations and the emphasis on locally sourced ingredients. However, I feel that Artizen is a restaurant that focuses a bit too much on presentation and trying to be unique, which inevitably results in a lot of trial and error dishes that ultimately come off as being too experimental. For the prices, we also expected much better service than we received.

Ultimately, I'd recommend giving them a try - because it's the kind of place that I think some people might really enjoy. But for a couple of diners who are constantly searching Phoenix for new favorites, I can't really say that Artizen is one of them."}
{"text":"I went on Christmas Day for the $45 pris fixe dinner. Excellent! I had a starter salad of mixed greens topped with a poached egg--not your usual salad, for sure, but very tasty. Another choice was lobster bisque.  For the main course I chose the filet. It was buttery tender. Other choices were a sole or duck confit. The dessert, which I took home was cheesecake. Another choice was a decadent chocolate cake. The service was friendly and attentive but not intrusive."}
{"text":"Oh. my. God.
You want to eat good or amazing? 
This place is off the hook!!
Wild mushrooms app, bone marrow, cornbread (like you've died and gone to heaven and heaven is covered in gently baked and browned cheese) and a kick ass Pork Ossu Buko

Catherine was our server and she was fantastic! Very personable, knowledgable and clearly excited to talk about the amazing food and cocktails (the cocktails truly are amazing I had one with pineapple and jalape√±o I think?  Incredible!)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here after a strenuous day hike looking for some great food to fill us up. We had a wonderful server named Catherine who timed our courses just right. We had the burrata salad, steak tartare, divers scallops and the parmesan lamb chops. Each dish was absolutely amazing! Balance of creaminess and acidity and fantastic flavor. We never reached for the salt or pepper, not once. Hats off to Chef Singh. I only regret i had no room for dessert. Sigh..."}
{"text":"Excellent food & great service.  Had the Roasted Bone Marrow, Foie Torchon, West Coast Charcuterie & Cheese Tasting, Smoked Arizona Sweet Potatoes, Thai Curried Cauliflower and more with friends.  Excellent wine selections!

Also, you can't beat the happy hour.  Half-priced wine, beer & cocktails and reasonably-priced appetizers."}
{"text":"the happy hour deal at Artizen is unbeatable! 4-6 pm, there are 5 cocktails for your choosing for $6 each and many delicious appetizers for your choosing for half off! amaze. i tried 2 cocktails, and ended up ordering the ceviche for dinner since i wanted something on the lighter side.  the portion size is great and at $16 it was a steal. i sat at the bar and service wasnt as attentive as i thought it would be, but was there for a casual evening so i didnt mind :) would come back - esp for the happy hour!"}
{"text":"We visited around 8pm on a Friday night and this place was quiet. To my surprise of course, given the beautiful decor and live music playing. Soon enough, we found out why it might not be a first choice for many. 

We had the Cheese tasting board followed by the restaurant week menu offerings. The service was ok but our main waiter was clumsy with everything. At one point of the night he almost dropped a knife on my BF's lap and broke a glass bottle. He barely cleaned up and left. For a fine dining establishment, it shouldn't feel like I'm getting a sports bar treatment. 

On to the food, we had burrata salad, pork chops, scallops, and nuts about chocolate. It was nothing impressive, pork chops were dry, dessert was weird (minimal chocolate for a chocolate dessert).  Only thing I enjoyed were the scallops. Overall, not a place I would crave to go back to again. \"Buyers remorse\" to the MAX!

Avoid it! Take your hard earn money somewhere else!y"}
{"text":"Just moved across the street and found the food to be creatively and deliciously prepared. Service was spotty in the 2 times we came this past week; dinner and breakfast. 

Didn't know what to expect in relation to portion size as my husband and I share most all meals because of the typical large portions served. 

The Cesar salad at $11 came with 4 nice looking romaine lettuce tops (which was a rather small dish) but delicious, then the Broccolini came in a huge portion and yummy but looked like the woody pieces served as the base as they were inedible. The Colorado Lamb Chops were tender, juicy and had amazing flavor; served in 3 pops; which were ok because by then I really just needed a small amount. 

Oh and breakfast was delicious and enjoyed by all 4 of us. My oatmeal was perfect in every way."}
{"text":"Don't view this wonderful restaurant as a typical place to eat in a hotel, because it's not. Instead, it's a terrific place to enjoy breakfast, lunch, or dinner, led by an extremely talented head chef, that happens to be located within the great Camby Hotel. Excellent customer service, a superbly diverse menu, and a great ambiance makes this a great place. Stayed at The Camby for an extended period, and thoroughly enjoyed the food and the great staff. Quality breakfast, creative dinners. Full bar, option for booths or tables, plus private rooms available also. So impressed by staff members Catherine, Jennifer, and Susan. Enjoyed my many meals here, looking forward to my next stay."}
{"text":"Quickly summed up, just OK at best. 

Now, not so quickly - This place has the bones and look of a place that should be hopping, for whatever reason, it's not. 

My wife and I showed up on Saturday evening at 6:30 with a reservation and were quickly seated. I mentioned we had a travelzoo voucher and was told, sorry, this is considered a holiday weekend so you can't use it (July 4 is a Tuesday this year but not worth a debate). OK, that's fine we'll stay and eat. 

While checking out the menu we couldn't believe how empty the place was for nearly 7pm on Saturday night... maybe 8 other people, total. Our waiter was a very strange guy who did not seem welcoming or excited to serve us at all. The entire evening, staff was just standing around watching the few guests eat as there were very few patrons. 

We ordered the honey fried chicken and the burger. At this point we were ready to eat some food and get on with our night. After a normal wait, the food comes out and looks good, we dig right in. At the first bite of chicken, a red bloody liquid starts to come out and the meat looks terrible. The manager was right there and saw my face. He quickly came over, saw the meat and took it away. He asked if I'd like a new one or something completely different. I stuck with the chicken and new one came out in short order. This time, it was fine and adequately cooked. The chicken was fine, nothing exceptional. The burger, just fine. Again, fine, but nothing amazing and probably priced higher than the quality. 

As we're finishing our meal, our waiter, who we hadn't seen during any of this chicken mess shows up to take our plates and ask about dessert, we pass. He comes back with a check, we pay and get out of there. 

The fact that they didn't attempt to comp the chicken, offer dessert and do something to make that situation better leaves a weird feeling. It actually leaves the same feeling the entire night did. Aside from a great looking interior, everything left much to be desired. 

Pros: decor and look 

Cons: below par staff, mediocre food, bad service, terrible atmosphere (empty)"}
{"text":"Artizen, located in the Camby Hotel is a FANTASTIC brunch spot. The food is delicious and the service is excellent (thank you Whitney for the fantastic service and conversation)! The atmosphere, decor and music, is perfection as well. Very good experience....will come back soon."}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink):
1 star:  Never again.
2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back.
3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad.
4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return.
5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.

Based on what we saw stepping inside, really wanted to love this place.  The shareables and small plates-heavy menu is something that we like since we like to try a little of everything.

Service was, uneven.  Took a while for a hostess to get to us and the servers were very busy.  This place might be a little understaffed.  But on to the food.

We ordered a KBBQ cauliflower shareable plate, and two small plates - tagliatelle carbonara and cioppino.

I would definitely come for happy hour (we came in at the end of happy and it was packed) since they have some food deals and I don't think value is a word that applies to the regular price menu.  For instance, the tagliatelle.  I know it says small plate - but 5 noodles.  They were pretty long and a good thickness, but 5 total noodles.  The cauliflower and cioppino were a little better in terms of value, but not by much.

The cauliflower is Korean inspired - kung pao cauliflower might have been more appropriate.  Spicy cauliflower with peanuts, with a side of soy-sesame dipping sauce.  Hints of Korean BBQ influence, it was fine.  The cauliflower wasn't overcooked and the flavors were fine.  Nothing mind-blowing.

The tagliatelle was maybe the best tasting dish.  The noodles were sufficiently al dente as they were nice and thick.  Th carbonara was sufficiently salty and rich.  I'm assuming (really just hoping) that the creaminess came from an egg, and if so, the egg did not get cooked by the noodles and did what they were supposed to do.

The cioppino here is not your traditional cioppino.  Detected a hint of Thai curry powder in there.  The broth is pretty light, not very tomatoey, compared to cioppino from SF.  The seafood in it was OK.  The squid was small, one clam.  Mussels, a couple were mangled or non-existent.  The shrimp was the best part of the dish.  Along with the crostini that came with it for dipping.  I don't think I'd order it again.

So definitely not a bad experience, but not a great one.  Debating whether we'd return since there was a lot of menu left to cover.  Again, I'd come for happy hour when there are food deals, otherwise, not so sure."}
{"text":"Great ambiance and interior design. Ordered the chicken chilaquilas for breakfast. Taste wonderful but several parts of the chicken had fat and grisle. Jayme was a very attentive server."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I am hard to please and own a business that is five stars on yelp and I know how hard it is to get 5 star reviews.That being said our service from Whitney deserves 6 stars.Top quality food with top quality service. She literally was the best waitress I have had in the last year I would say. The food was cooked perfect and we will be back many more times!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service.   Good bye Ritz and hello Camby and Artizen.  See u very soon"}
{"text":"It pains me to write this because I wanted to like Artizen, I really did but the service I received last Monday was horrible. This was my second time visiting and the first, sadly, was almost as bad as the second. It took almost 25 minutes after I was seated before I realized that nobody had come up to the table that we decided to hail a server over. This restaurant is a decent size and we were probably one of 5 tables seated so I was rather confused. Our server was friendly but I could tell he was overwhelmed and rushed. Later in the evening he asked if I would like a second drink and I said yes. That took about 15-20 minutes before HE realized I still hadn't received it yet so he went behind the bar and made it himself. The food was delicious. I got the avocado half as an appetizer and the pork chop for dinner both were fantastic! But due to the service I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Major disappointment. Personnel issues... no one at the front to pick up the car. Waiter slow, forgetful and hard to understand... and he forgot to get raw sugar, forgot to get ketchup and hot sauce, forgot to refill coffee, got one of two orders completely wrong, argued that the toast was toasted (it wasn't). PLUS the cutlery had water stains and the meat was way undercooked. The three tables around us also complained of slow service. On the PLUS side... the manager was very apologetic and explained how they were short-staffed (they were), the beignets were excellent and the coffee was above average. Far, far, far below the Ritz... and hoping they save this before 24th and Camelback loses another hotel."}
{"text":"I Booked a reservation for a Wednesday night for 3 people. It was a quiet night, so I don't believe the reservation was necessary but it didn't hurt either. 
We had a round of cocktails and the cheese board for appetizer, along with a delicious mushroom dish. 
Our entrees were very good, although one pasta dish was a bit dry. I had the lamb. It was perfect. 
Over all, a very nice evening, it's a beautiful setting."}
{"text":"This little restaurant within the Camby hotel is super good. We went for lunch and it was a great ambiance- quiet and good lighting and the service was great. They accommodated with my diet and gave me a lettuce bun. I got the chicken sandwhich, of course fries are always good but get the side salad! It has grapes and caramel corn and is so unique and yummy. I hope to go back soon!"}
{"text":"Last night was the second time I've had an incredible dining experience at Artizen. Both times we have sat outside, both times our group have had the knowledgeable Midwesterner Jeff Menzer as our server. Each time the food has been fabulous, from the honey drizzled cornbread, the salads, to the various main dishes, such as hot fried chicken, the pork chop and sea bass! I'm kind of a dessert snob , but the crime br√ªl√©e is one of the best I've ever eaten. (I forgot to mention that the wine selections are A-mazing!) Id recommend this restaurant to anyone anytime and not just those  go stay at the hotel. Treat yourself! You won't regret it!!"}
{"text":"Went in for a glass of wine and our server was on point. We sat in the bar last night around 5ish? I have to say there is a bartender that is usually there and gives the worst service. I didn't see him last night and we were greeted immediately by a handsome young man and he was very tentative. I come here often and although we didn't eat, some of the appetizers and main dishes are sooooo delicious!"}
{"text":"A friend and I came to Artizen for happy hour and felt like it was alright. First of all, they have complimentary but mandatory valet parking. If you know me, you know that I hate valet parking....especially when it's off hours and places aren't busy and they literally pull your car into a spot 10 feet from where you're standing....it's just ridiculous. 

Anyway, we each ordered drinks, which were discounted for HH, but still not super cheap. The drinks were alright, nothing terribly special. They also had food specials and we decided to try the scotch egg and the flatbread with spinach artichoke dip essentially on top. The flatbread was AWESOME. So tasty.... so garlicky..... I'd highly recommend it. The scotch egg was HORRIFIC. So disgusting we couldn't even finish it.... and we both love eggs. Something weird about that thing. This wouldn't be tops on my list for places to return to, but I'd come back for that flat bread....yum."}
{"text":"They take all their food here serious in a \"foodie\" kind of way -- from the drinks to each item on the menu.  I went small plates- sunchokes with almonds; veal cheeks and bacon pate.   Oh my god they were all awesome.  Wine bottle on the scraps list are half price Sunday to thursday making the mark up reasonable.  Their regular wine is an it pricey to. The mark up ( assuming my normal Florida prices apply here)."}
{"text":"This place is worth coming to.

If you haven't eaten here this is a must go to place. I am extremely impressed by the quality of the food. From the yellowtail crude to the scallops...just wow

My wife had the filet mignon and it was perfect. Our waiter Jeff rocked the house with his knowledge of good food.

Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Brunch at Artizen is a delightfully delicious happening!! Friendly, efficient service and dynamite coffee and hot cocoa. Thanks for the soy milk!! We started with the Fried Fair Bread with a smear of cream cheese frosting - oh my land. SO good - crispy and flavorful with a sweet/salty yum. Our party of four enjoyed the Eggs Benedict with perfectly poached eggs, and rosemary potatoes (so nice); the Pancakes ... holy moly - so light and fluffy and perfect; and an omelette. Loved the choices available for the omelette including goat cheese - everything was done up just right and the setting was just about as perfect as you can be. Thanks so much!!"}
{"text":"A fabulous restaurant located inside the gorgeous luxury Camby Hotel. Nice ambiance with delicious food. The staff was attentive and friendly. The duck confit with pasta was amazing. The donuts and coffee dessert was done to perfection. I love that it wasn't too sweet. A perfect lunch on this gorgeous day in AZ."}
