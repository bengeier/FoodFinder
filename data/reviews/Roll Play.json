{"text":"Excellent environment. Staff always came by to check if we're okay with our drinks and food. Large selection of specialty drinks. Table booths are too small tho"}
{"text":"We stopped in one night while we were in the area having date night, and I'm pretty glad we did. I love board games. They had a very decent selection, although the games we played were already missing pieces. Very unfortunate. 

It was pretty busy, but not busy or crowded enough to be bothersome. I have hearing troubles, so I was pleased it wasn't deafening in there for a Saturday night. 

It's very open, spaced out and very well lit. The decor is well done. Our food and drinks were very delicious. And the prices seem steep, but with no cover charge, that's pretty understandable. It's about the same as some other dessert places I've been to, and just as good.

I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Nice place, clean, great selection of games. However, the waiters do not keep an eye to see who needs help and the food/drinks selection is very limited."}
{"text":"I will likely never go back to Snakes and Lattes unless those with me are physically incapable of going anywhere else.

Here's the good:

- No cover charge - apparently the owner said to my bf, \"We'd like you to buy a drink or some food while you're here, but otherwise, we don't believe in charging you to sit down.\"

- The food we had was actually GOOD. No really, it was. No more settling for sub par fare at Snakes n Lattes. Had a pizza and something else - I honestly can't remember.

- Game masters were very friendly and knowledgeable, no less than we've seen elsewhere.

- Nice booth seating - they have traditional 4 seater tables in the centre, but along the window wall and by the front and back there are larger group seatings with couches! Yippee!

- I *think* they take reservations. I could be wrong, but last I heard they did.

- With our bill, instead of candy or mints, we were given a pair of dice! So neat, and such a nice touch!

The bad:

- When we went, they were still acquiring their liquor license. I doubt it will take much time for that to come in.

- Selection isn't quite as big as SnL - we still found a number of games to play we'd never played before however, and they have lots of room for new games as they come.

If you like board game cafes, I seriously recommend giving this place a try. I'll be the nerd in the corner, looking for people to play City of Horror."}
{"text":"Love the vibe, very clean, lots of games

I enjoy the Connect Four set up already so the game begins as soon as you walk in!!

Good setup with good noise control, tables spaced out enough that the excitements of nearby games do not disturb your concentration!!"}
{"text":"Easy 5 stars for the amazing service our group received!!!
Went in with a group of 7 to celebrate a birthday tonight. Our server was so sweet, and very attentive and after he found out it was our girls birthday they surprised her with a huge slice of cake with a candle. Later in the night the same server brought her a free shot courtesy of the staff, and offered the rest of our group shots that were about half priced the norm! Very sweet of them to do that. And in general, the food and drinks were delicious and the selection of board games is good! Will definitely return (and hope to see our awesome server! ;))"}
{"text":"I came here with a few friends after dinner on Friday night, and we can't wait to come back again!

Roll Play Cafe has a minimum charge of $10 per person. They offer a variety of food options from soups to salads to sandwiches to pizzas. As for drinks, they have hot tea, Italian sodas, bottled sodas, and even beer. Despite the minimum, they have a 2-hour limit when it gets busy, and it was surprisingly quite busy on a cold and rainy Friday night.

The 4 of us each ordered a drink, and the High Roller Nachos to share. I enjoyed my bottled cream soda, but the nachos could have been better. I doubt I will order it again, but I don't mind giving their pizzas and sandwiches a try next time.

The cafe is a lot bigger than I had expected. It is very spacious, bright, and welcoming, but bigger tables for our game(s) + food + drinks would be great. ;) The variety of board and card games is decent, but I noticed some of the games were a little worn out.

We enjoyed our time here, and we're glad it is close to our workplace. I am sure we will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I had a good time at Roll Play Cafe. It might be better suited to lunch than to dinner, but there is a modest selection of games, very reasonably priced and delicious menu (with decent portion size).  There were obvious drawbacks, and two people in my party were adamant they prefer Snakes & Lattes' cover charge to a 2 hour maximum, but between the food and the games, I think this is definitely a recommendation spot for me.

If you go in the evening, order the pizza.  They are all 12-inch, thin crust and very satisfying, their hummus (I shudder even typing that pronunciation) and nachos were delicious as well, but their lunchtime menu seemed tempting.

I should also note that we got a discount of 10% for confirming that we checked in on Yelp (it can also be foursquare, but since you're reading this, I figure Yelp might want your business).

Some will argue the \"maximum time without cover\" vs. \"unlimited play with cover\" line.  I personally see the merit of both, and do not care strongly one way or another, but it is worth noting if it weighs on your decision making. Don't expect to stay here much past the 2 hour mark. They're not rude about it, and they don't rush you if you're eating, but they do maintain the turnover rate. 

The drawbacks were these: 

the service was, at best, mediocre. One waiter ran off to find out what vegetables were in the green salad and didn't come back till his coworker answered the question about 7 minutes later. After that, the service was alright, but a little slow. understandable, since it didn't seem like the staff was at capacity.

The game selection is modest; nowhere near snakes & lattes, only workable.  It wasn't hard to find the games worth playing, but for people who own wide game libraries, it wasn't a particularly scintillating library.

the music was loud, not uncomfortably so for an evening spot, but it was difficult to be on the learning end of a board game tutorial if you can't hear someone across the table clearly without them yelling. luckily the staff obliged us and dropped the volume slightly, though they seemed pretty concerned that everyone be able to hear the tune over the crowd noise, which was weird.

No liquor license.  This might not mean much to you, but I figure if I can kill a 2 hour mealtime on board games I could probably get away with a beer or a Glenlivet neat.  

If they improve any two of these, I would bump the rating up a star.  I hope that happens too.  This place is fun, but don't count out the myriad of other options."}
{"text":"Not bad, not great.  A VERY expensive place though.   For people not eating food, you have to pay $20/head.  If you are eating food, you still get charged but $5/head.  The menu has changed a lot since first opening.  The only options were pizza flatbread for $17-$19 (tasty), or snacks involving nuts etc.  Not a lot of choice.  The drinks were expensive too.  Roughly $7-$9 per beverage.  They trick you though.  I saw \"Gin\" listed and ordered one for $7 but my partner pointed out that at the bottom, if you order pop to mix it's an extra $2 and if you order tonic, soda etc it's an extra $4!!  $11 for a gin and tonic at a board game cafe are you serious??

All-in-all, a decent place to play some games.  But they really have to figure out their prices and menu."}
{"text":"This place is great. Super fun and amazing drinks. We had to wait when we first came in and the hostest  was very accommodating by finding us a seat at the share table. Service is outstanding and the environment is super chill. The only thing is I wish there were a bit more games for two for a nice date night but still a fun place to go"}
{"text":"It's an awesome bar, I hosted a birthday party there last weekend. The space is perfect, awesome music and chill vibe. The staff is great, friendly and accommodating, helped with cutting our cake and suggested some delicious cocktails for everyone. We really felt comfortable and at eased in the lively environment. The bartender also made us some birthday shots! My friends and I had a great time and we would definitely go back to try out their live music Friday nights!"}
{"text":"This is the first board game café I've been to and it was quite a treat! 

Since my friends and I went on a Sunday night, the place wasn't over packed but rather relaxing! The service was great and since it was my birthday and they realized after we had finished the giant slice of cake, the waitress actually apologized for not knowing and said we could've gotten a sparkler on it. To me, that was a friendly gesture. 

The place was a slight bit pricey but in terms of the hot chocolate I had gotten, the size was big and it was actually pretty good (and I am picky with those sorts of things). I think it was worth it. The games were in good condition and we were only ever short one set of instructions. 

The prices were a bit strange but I understood why they were set this way. $5 per person but you need to order something to eat or drink or else it's $20 for the person who didn't order anything. So depending on what you order, it's cheaper to order some small thing then just come in to play. 

I would recommend it if you were in the area and I think I would go there again some time."}
{"text":"The best place to try new games with friends; however, the food wasn't that good. I ordered the Oreo cheesecake, which should be the best dish, and it tastes as a normal Oreo cake."}
{"text":"Roll Play used to be a great place to hang out and play games.  It's still an OK place, and I'll probably come back because they have a great game selection and a comfortable atmosphere.  I'm just not a fan of their scaled down menu and that they charge $5 per player.

I enjoyed the fact that we could get fun, non alcoholic drinks like bubble tea, but this is no longer available.  They have a new libations menu and a bunch of craft beers, but nothing fun for the lone DD.  Alas.  Also, before they required a $10 minimum food/drink spend per player, which was never an issue to hit.  Now they charge a $5 fee per player.  When my table is continuously ordering drinks and snacks, it just feels like gouging.  Hopefully they're still in the process of working out some kinks and they bring about a few more changes."}
{"text":"The is a very trendy and modern board game cafe. The atmosphere is warm and inviting. Great selection of games and friendly servers.

The food is delicious.  We tried the warm spinach dip and prime rib panini. I was told that the prime rib is made fresh in house. Both are must when you come here. I tried the Canadiana coffee. Very interesting concept.  It has maple syrup in it. The misses tried the banana strawberry smoothie. It was very good. Made with fresh ingredients. 

We stayed for a while playing Ticket to ride. So fun.
Note: if you want to learn to play a game, just ask the servers. They're very knowledgeable and friendly."}
{"text":"Found off yelp. Very close to hotel. Delicious salsa and great atmosphere! Love the name too!"}
{"text":"I was part of a group of 14 celebrating my sister's bday. Staff was extremely attentive and helpful, and had great suggestions and advice about drinks. Nobody had complaints about their cocktails. The Peking duck flatbread was great and a hit amongst the group. No complaints at all. We were especially won over by the fact that they treated the whole group to shots in honor of my sister's bday, on the house, as we were leaving. Thank you Roll Play!"}
{"text":"Good place to chill and play some board games BUT I wouldn't recommend ordering food... The quantities you get for the price are abysmal. Food quality was pretty mediocre too."}
{"text":"This place has a wide range of Board Games and the decor is very nice.
The pizza is very delicious, but it wasn't cut very evenly so portions weren't necessarily fair.
The Egg Waffle is very yummy! (I personally am not so crazy about the banana nutella whip cream, maybe if it didn't have the banana) 
The drinks are only okay but they are still new so i am sure they are working things out. 
Prices of the food is in my opinion a little bit costly for what the food is. 
The service of this place was very mediocre, they were nice but seem some what inexperienced. 

Note: I do have to say that i love the cute little customized dice they have.

Overall this place is pretty cool and i'd probably come here sometime with my friends."}
{"text":"Pretty busy but I've never waited more than half an hour for a table even on a weekend. Big selection of games and cute space. Close to other attractions and the service is great!"}
{"text":"What a fun little place!! We were here as a group of four last week and had a great time. The food is pretty good. We ordered the nachos which were great. I had hot chocolate which was very nice and chocolate-y. It ha an actual piece of chocolate in it :) chocolate makes me happy!!
Like others have mentioned, the selection of games is not huge but it was just right. You're really not going to go to a place like this and spend 10 mins reading the instructions of a new game. Are you? Maybe you would. I wouldn't. 
The service was slow. It took quite some time to get out drinks and food. But the staff was super nice. Which made up for the slowness. They'd check in on us from time to time and see if we needed anything, etc. 
Overall, I'd go here again."}
{"text":"I don't normally write reviews and I've only been here once, but I have to say I was really impressed by the staff.  They were friendly and attentive from start to finish.  They hosted a group competition for one of the games and offered to battle you on Connect 4.  Both options had a prize award if you won.    

The place seems a bit noisy, but probably not out of place for a board game cafe.  I enjoyed the pizza and my friend enjoyed the hot dog - although not the draw for the place, both were way better than other board game cafe experiences.  The game selection was a bit limited, but there were more than enough options for many hours.  Connect 4 on each table was a nice touch.

I would definitely go again."}
{"text":"I heart this place. My sister and her boyfriend are regulars and took me one Sunday when I was visiting Toronto. I played a bunch of games I've never heard of and it was a really nice atmosphere. We sat there for 3 hours and stayed for dinner. They have a bunch of games I've never heard of but will definitely be getting for home like Guillotine. 

For food I had the green salad and it was very tasty, and for dessert we shared a giant slice of oreo cake I had been eyeing up since we arrived, it was worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Truly love this place, had a lot of fun.

The only reason why I didn't give this place a perfect 5 is because of the slightly limited game selection at the moment. As well as the semi slow service at times. But outside of that it is great. Food is really good for a little game cafe. Nothing felt overpriced at all. The environment or \"vibe\" is really comfortable as well. Also, they give you a 2 hour sitting limit (which is more forced when it's busy) but I was there for 5 hours without a single issue from them."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time this weekend and found it generally enjoyable though not incredible, and I'd go again if I wanted a quiet night out with cocktails. It has potential to be excellent.

The strengths: It's got a lot of innovative and interesting cocktails, almost all of which are done in an unusual manner that you don't really see in Toronto. Standouts from our orders included the King of Toronto which came shrouded in a smokey glass container and which contained an orange rind peeled in the shape of a maple leaf frozen in a giant ice cube (seriously order it, you're in for a treat), one whose name I've forgotten but was lit on fire, and the Sakura (yogurt drink/grapefruit juice, vodka). There are also a number of drinks infused with traditional Chinese herbs (red dates etc) that were pretty delicious and interesting as well. Drinks are not particularly cheap, but not particularly expensive either if you normally partake in the craft cocktail scene - about $8-14/beverage. There's also snacks that they bring out for free. Happy Hour is from 5-7PM when the beers and certain well drinks are $5. This is a very welcome addition to Toronto's craft cocktail scene. The music was also pretty fantastic (kudos for playing Rhye and SBTRKT!)

The weaknesses: The room and atmosphere are a little awkward, unsure of whether it wants to be a bar or a board game cafe. I like that they're trying to carve out a space between these two concepts, but it's a little too sedate to be the type of hip bar that you see on West Queen West/Ossington/Bloordale and a little too bar-ish and alcohol-driven to fit into the preconceptions of what a board game cafe are in Toronto (generally well-lit, variety of non-alcoholic drink options, extensive game selection). Further, the interior set up seems to be somewhat ineffective - there's a lot of space between the tables in the main section, which makes the entire space feel a little empty. I understand that they're trying to focus on getting live acts in this space as well which may explain the empty space, but it feels a little too exposed if you compare it to say Burdock which also has its own live space and makes its own beer. They also had to kick us out eventually since we stopped ordering drinks and there was a backlog due to the lack of tables, but this was done fairly nicely and we understood the reason.

Overall: I like it and would go again, but I'd like to see it more as a bar and less as a board game space. One way to do that would be to make it more comfortable for people to stand-up in the venue. I understand from other reviewers that this place was originally a board game cafe, so it might be disappointing for existing customers to see it transformed into something else, but for me, its transformation seems half complete. Fix this and it could be a really interesting place in a neighbourhood generally not known for interesting places."}
{"text":"The idea is pretty cool. Its a cafe with board games and booths for you and your friends to hang out and play/chillax.

The decor is simple and the layout is clean and pretty straight forward, the staff friendly and always smiling. Their selection of games can be bigger, they do however carry most of the famous staples (scrabble, monopoly, chess etc.)

The food menu is pretty small and the items are overpriced and food just not that good. Ive been here four times and on every occasion the drinks were good but the food not so much. We ordered a pizza twice and on both occasions it was either dry and overcooked or bland and soggy from the middle.  

If youre going there just to play then be prepared to deal with the servers every 15 minutes or so. They do reserve the right to limit your play time especially if you dont order anything off their menu.

Ill be checking out other places next time."}
{"text":"Very cool cafe. Had lots of fun playing games. The meat lover pizza was good aswell :)"}
{"text":"Love this place, although it's more of a lounge than board game cafe. Has barely any games and would be too loud to play any communication-based games. But we picked up a jenga and had fun with it. Music with live dj is awesome, small dance floor makes the place cozy, eclectic feel, great staff that extended the dinner menu late for us cuz we didnt want just the midnight menu. Would come back for the vibe for lounge feel, but not for serious board gaming."}
{"text":"This place was AMAZING! 
Don't let the sign trick you, this place isn't a cafe at all, and the food the food was amazing.

My boyfriend and I were looking for a place to have lunch downtown, we saw an interesting sign with an amazing pun (Roll Play Cafe), being a lover of puns, I decided to try this place out.  

As soon as I walked in, the decor made my jaw drop.  It wasn't what I expected from a hidden tucked away restaurant.  I was greeted immediately by a friendly server who brought us to a table.  

She told us about the special promotion that was going on called \"Lunch and Play\".
For ~$10 per person, I was able to select a full sized menu item (coffee drink included), and I was able to play one of their many board games.  Did I mention that dessert was included? I got the chicken pesto panini, an americano and got the mini Belgium waffle with maple syrup and it was DELICIOUS.  The bread was crispy and tasted so fresh, americano was strong and smooth and the Belgium waffle, where do I start.  It was probably one of the best desserts I've had in a while.  

Overall, the food was great, the service was impeccable, she was very helpful and told us about that promo which really saved us a bunch of money.  She was very knowledgeable about the menu and answered all of our questions.  

5 out of 5 stars would definitely go again."}
{"text":"If you're into board games like I am, you would have checked out a few of the spots in the city already.  Roll Play has gone through a change of ownership in the past month, and they have tried a more sophisticated bar-like atmosphere in addition to the board games.

When we knocked on the door to come in, we were warmly greeted by the attentive staff who directed us to a table and gave us freebies like popcorn throughout the night.  They also have an Asian inspired drink menu, which matches the décor of red lanterns and dark tones, such as an Asian inspired sangria.  There's also an area for live music on Friday nights.

The space was sufficiently big that you could go and play board games without feeling cramped like at more dedicated game shops and cafes.  We tried out Coup, as well as some party games, and had a great time.

Would definitely come back, especially if bringing a mixed group of friends that may only be casual gamers, some of whom may want to drink and chill while the rest of us dive into the board games."}
{"text":"I went on a Saturday night. They have DJs there every other Saturday now! The music was fun and lively. 

The place is really pretty the ambiance is very relaxing too. The hostess and waiters are all very friendly and attentive. I told the waiter what type of drinks I liked and asked him to recommend me something and I was not disappointed. I started with a cucumber mojito then had a geisha (my favourite), then another mojito. Had a standard beer and tequila shots but you must try the cocktails here.

Will be back because I am so addicted to the drinks here! and I haven't been able to find a Geisha cocktail that comes close to the way Roll Play makes it!"}
{"text":"My friends and I recently visited this place and it ended up being a funny situation. My friends had come here before and said it was a good board game cafe, upon reaching we realized it did not look like one at all. 
Initially I thought I was entering a club or some sort and the place was practically empty. We sat dow the the server explained that they had changed it to a bar instead of a cafe. We were okay with that and asked about games, turned out they only had a few playstation games and card games. We asked if they had board games and the server said yes they did but we would have to buy them, they didn't have any open ones. We were really looking to try a few board games and they kept insisting that we buy them because it works out to be the same price as going to a board game cafe, only that at a board game cafe if I don't like the game I can change it mid way. Here I would be stuck with it... lifelong. And so we left.

The server was a sweet girl and she was trying hard to get us to stay but she had very little to work with... if it was a bar, why not have a pool table, dart board, etc. It seemed like they weren't really sure about the concept of the place and it was just weird. 

Was it a bar? A game joint? A lounge? What was it?? I guess I'll never find out..."}
{"text":"Trend is something that must be avoided at all cost. The idea of a board game restaurant is not a force that could persuade me even if it offered free food. But when I heard that the menu was consulted by Jack Lee (not that celebrity chef who throws his thumbs up and pops his collar at every camera pointed at him [I didn't even know you can pop the collars on those chef whites), a rising star within the culinary consulting world, I decided to throw some money at this place.

The real estate is enormous!
This \"cafe\" (restaurant is more befitting) is immediately next to the Toronto landmark 'The World's Biggest Book Store', and I think some of that enthusiasm rubbed off on the people who designed this place. Clean, simple ambiance with a hint of sophistication. I was not expecting anything of this sort from a business that offers its patrons with potential heart attacks via the sound of collapsing Jenga pieces that can occur at any moment in time. Booth capable of seating four people (six if you're fairy sized) stretch across the south side window. There is capacity for over 110 people, what kind of cafe is this??
I do struggle between the semi sectioned off Canadian Flag section and the huge sofa chair area. Both areas are very cozy and close to the main games shelf. I don't recognize much of the games here, I've only played Monopoly as a child, which probably explains my affinity with money. I also dream of owning a real estate empire. Maybe it is good that I didn't play snakes & ladders then, otherwise I'd probably be somewhere climbing a building for Green Peace.

Italian soda in mason jars, various coffee and teas, seven dollar cupcakes?! I cannot be fooled by mere esthetics and inflated numbers; I ordered everything.

Who is this Jack Lee?
My palate yearns for more of his magic touch. My hats off for the chef who creates every item on the menu with obviously fresh ingredients. The quality of the food is consistently good, challenging my perspectives on certain foods that I've pointed with only my nose at before. Who knew a croissant sandwich with eggs and ham could be so bloody tasty? Smoked meat burger? Tiramisu coffee dessert? Why on Earth is this cafe not advertising itself as a restaurant instead? The name suggests a college hangouts, but everything about this place is on par with a fully serviced restaurant. In fact, this is what I always wished what an International Hotel restaurant would be. Drinks when I need it, good food on demand, highbrow desserts and alcohol.
Oh yes, Roll Play Cafe is licensed. Why the hell isn't this place 24hrs and places like..well, any other 24hr place/s is/are. Indeed, this place is the 'Anti-other 24hrs place.' Only, it's not 24hrs. Make sense?

I sound like a Western philosopher with all these questions. Allow me channel the Asian philosopher and offer some answers.
Unbelievable culinary vision, romantic ambiance that I would take any of my fictitious sweethearts to, from the most exciting (Jenga) game, to the most mundane (Ticket to Ride). An ambitious menu that unsurprisingly attracts not only university students, but foodies throughout the city, a mean corn soup that restores the bad name corn has been given in this overly organic modern society, and seven dollar cupcakes.
Don't let the name and concept be a deterrent. Roll Play Cafe is cooking up some serious business.

There is a rumour that the owner is contemplating decorating the walls of the stairway ascending to the dining floor with artificial grass. I don't know what the hell kind of game he played as a child to think now as an adult that being a good idea, probably something 'educational'."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. First of all, I love the fact that it is very accessible, just a block away from the crowded eaton centre. Cozy, good music, and not bombarded with tons of people. You can still be seated even during 4-6pm. They have a minimum 10$ charge per head which is consumable. They have wide varieties of food selection compared to your average café. My friend and I had the pizza(kind of too oily for my taste) and nachos. Also had the drink called \"london fog\" and it was delish. And my goodness, the staff were amazing! Very friendly and helpful! Even helped us pick which board game to play. This place is so cool and I will definitely come back with more friends! I deducted 1 star for that too oily pizza( had to wipe off oil from my pepperonis using the table napkins!)"}
{"text":"went there with a few friends on a friday night at 8pm. nice seating and pretty spacious. they have an okay amount of games. try the matcha latte, it's good stuff!
however,  the place was a bit too loud.  i had trouble hearing my friends talk and they were sitting across from me..."}
{"text":"I came here for maybe the fourth or fifth time the other day and was really disappointed. Since I've been here multiple times and been satisfied, this was a bit of an anomaly, so I'll keep it up at three stars rather than dropping it to a two star. But it was weirdly bad this time. The green tea latte, which was delicious the last time I had it, was a bitter, milky mess. I got a pizza and honestly, it was just gross. Too much cheese (didn't think that was possible) and really greasy; thin crust couldn't support the weight of the cheese. There was a 'decorative' piece of garlic in the middle that looked really unattractive. I'm not sure what went wrong this time, but I guess Roll Play is more inconsistent than I thought, and I would not recommend the pizza."}
{"text":"One of the most attentive staff in any downtown Toronto Bar/Cafe! Prices are a bit higher than most bars in downtown but you get free snacks + free games + best service so it's well worth it! I just found out about this place before a week and already been there 3 times.. I would say it's a great start... :)

Keep it up girls!!"}
{"text":"- the food here destroys snakes and lattes
- game selection is not as large, but still has what you need for your casual to medium-core gamer.
- the fact that there isn't a cover is nice, and the $10 min spend isn't too bad considering even if you were going to get a couple of drinks, you'll be all sorted.
- BONUS TIP: would also recommend hitting up the Hairy Tarantula (just north on Yonge) if you want to purchase one of the new games you just tried super-cheap!"}
{"text":"Waaaay better than snakes and lattes. At least one can get a seat here, since they take reservations AND reserve the right to kick people out if there is a crowd. They also do not have a cover charge, so all you have to do is order at least one menu item. As a result, if you want to be really cheap about it you can pick a really quiet date/time and order the cheapest drink (i think around $3?) and sit there forever if your moral conscience can allow you to do such a thing. Point it, it is superior to snakes and lattes. They also actually have good food! They have a wide variety of salads and flatbread pizzas, which are decently portioned and yummy. I would deter from the bubble waffles though since it seems severely overpriced at $11. You can get the waffle on its own for $3 at pmall, and I don't think ice cream and whipped cream warrants an extra $7 to the dish. 

Minor point of irritation: Waitress was polite but, as was we were waiting for our group of friends to trickle in she kept interrupting our conversation to see if we wanted to order anything. I think that once would have been enough, and by the 2nd time it ought to have been clear that we intended to wait for our friends. This actually just made me feel like I was being pressured to order, and though I can understand where she is coming from, I would really like to enjoy some uninterrupted conversation with friends.

Overall, this place will be upgraded to a 5 star from me once they get even more games in!

SIDENOTE: Their games are also newer and in better condition than snakes and lattes as well."}
{"text":"I had no idea Roll Play existed until a friend of a friend opened my eyes. Located a block away from the Toronto Eaton Centre, the short walk made this the perfect hang out spot on a cold windy night in the city. I love to setup: more cafe than board game layout with a pretty tasty menu. They only drawback is the price of some of the menu items -- kinda pricey for a cafe, eg: $8 for a piece of cake you could get 1/2 price at any coffee shop and $14.00 pizzas that let's face it, will run you $20 when you add tax and tip) ..... BUT on the plus side: there isn't a seating fee (which a lot of other board game cafes charge just to be in the joint), the servers are friendly and knowledgeable about the games, and although they said we had 2 hours....no one gave us the boot. Happily played for 3.5 hours! The food was good, and a lot of it was inexpensive. The games were a little limited but that could just be a testament to the full house. I'm assuming all the good games were in use.  I'm pretty confident to say I'll be converting a few friends of my own to visit.   Really glad this place is around."}
{"text":"Awesome place, very cosy and modern decoration. Soooooooo many games, many never even heard of before, we especially enjoyed the Riff Raff! So much fun.  I went there with my other four friends for girls night. We loved the self selected pizza which we got to choose the cheese meat sauce and veggies. The thin crunchy crust was so yummy! Drinks are good, I had a Papaya Paradise. I think they just opened today, very new. If u are looking for a place to chat to chill or get together with friends, this is it! And their waiter is cute, Haha~~~~~"}
{"text":"Came here for a tea. This place is in a great location, is clean and well maintained. 

Service staff are attentive without being overbearing and the seating is comfy. Although I didn't have the food, they have some interesting items on their menu that are worth a try. 

It's a great alternative to a coffee spot and a cute date spot with board games."}
{"text":"lots of board games, not too expensive, good food, and great staff.  All right downtown.  What more could you ask for, it's great."}
{"text":"Positives:
AWESOME atmosphere. Large space with lots of light. Food and drinks are yummy. Friendly service. Lots of selection for games and 90% of them are in perfect condition. Watermelon soap in the bathroom (which are small but cute and clean)! ^_^ Menus are cute and easy to read. 

Negatives:
SLOOOOOW/NONEXISTENT/borderline poor service. Had to flag down the server every time, dishes were constantly sitting on the table. At one point, I started clearing the table to take it to the counter at which point, the clerk/chef ran up, embarrassed, and took it. I think the servers either don't communicate or don't have designated sections, or both as two servers came by to take our order at one point and loooooong stretches of time went by where no one checked in on us and we had to literally wave someone down to order. $1.50 charge for bills under $10 if paying by debit/credit. No split bills. Had to ask for cutlery/plates with every dish. Disappointed in service, overall. 


Ordered: 
Black tea (summer peach) - yummy. 
Artichoke/potato dip - flatbread was great but there was no artichoke? Dip just tasted like creamy potato salad. Still tasty but not what I expected. 
Bubble waffle - they make it from scratch onsite so expect a bit of a wait but it's good. Big scoops of chocolate and vanilla ice cream, strawberries, bananas, chocolate syrup, on top of a big waffle with one or those swirly chocolate wafer sticks. More than big enough for two people. 
About $33 for all that, plus another tea and two chai lattes. Pretty reasonable to me. 

Notes: 
Pretty busy on a Sunday afternoon. 
Easy to miss - it's just to the right of the World's Biggest Bookstore. 
$10 minimum spend per person (at first I found this to be very off putting but as I thought about it, it seems fair considering they're supplying free games). 
Two hours seating limit - we stayed for five but were consistently ordering food/drinks for most of it and there wasn't a rush of people coming in. 
You can also purchase games. 

I REALLY enjoyed myself but would likely hesitate before going back - slow/lack of service bothers me."}
{"text":"Went here with a gf and it was fun! They were all out of the hot drinks though and we had to wait 45 min for a seat. Game selection is okay and staff didn't know too much about the games. Place is not too big."}
{"text":"What an INCREDIBLE PLACE!!

We came here for Raymond's UYE and enjoyed some amazing games and absolutely delicious food.

Firstly, the game selection is great. I'd never played Ticket to Ride before, but it came strongly recommended by Wil Wheaton, so I wanted to give it a shot. After getting confused by the instructions, one of their staff came over and explained the game to us and showed us how to play it. That was super helpful and very nice. After we got our bill, our server also came by and recommended a couple of new games (including a feature game, which will change every month or so) for us for our next visit. She was very knowledgable and clearly very passionate about different games. 

The space is big, open, airy and modern. The perfect place to spend a Sunday afternoon. The tables and chairs were at a good height, which is important when playing games (and eating and drinking).

I really enjoyed their food selection. The drinks are a bit on the pricey side, but considering they don't charge a cover/hourly fee, that's fine. It's still cheaper than a movie. There is a $10 minimum per person, which they make easy to achieve, and not in an obnoxious way. They even had that green tea with the roasted rice in it, my favourite. Each cup of tea comes with one free refill. I found the food VERY well priced. Most entrees are about $9, so if you get one drink and dish, you've reached the minimum. The selection is pretty good, but my complaint would be that there are few dairy-free options and no vegan options for entrees or desserts. 

The servings are huge. I got the smoked pork sandwich, which is more like a fancy ham, with roasted mushrooms. It came with a nice side of tossed greens and edamame beans. I ate half then and ate the other half for lunch today. It's been 3 hours and I'm still full. That has to be some kind of record for me. The food was cleverly plated in long, rectangular wooden dishes, which means that you had plenty of room for the games. Most of the food is stuff you can eat with your hands, and not very saucy, but I wonder how they'll manage to keep the games clean!

One thing that bugged me was that they seemed to keep forgetting about my dairy allergy. I have a feeling that these guys opened pretty recently and they will iron out these things soon enough. Otherwise, service was warm, quick and very helpful. Everyone on staff seems to be extremely keen on making this business a great success. 

The place was absolutely packed when we left, with more people waiting for a seat. I expect this place to be absolutely huge, considering how comfortable it is, how delicious the food is, the prices, location and service. I absolutely can't wait to go back and try out that new game they told us about, too!!"}
{"text":"I have been Roll Play Cafe a few times, and have not had a great impression of the place so far. While the atmosphere is entertaining, the management and service leave a lot to be desired. The selection of games is also much less than other board game cafes. 

I went to the cafe with a large group of friends, and had a fun time drinking and playing games. However we were told after we got there that we had to pay not only a higher minimum food purchase of $20 (usually $10), as well as an 18% gratuity. We settled for that and ordered away. The service was fairly  slow, but eventually our orders came. 

Once we were done eating and playing, the bill came. Yes 'bill'. Singular. Over around 12 people out bill came to over $350.
According to the waitress, they weren't able to split a bill with over 8 or so people. They gave us a pencil and paper, and said we needed to manually split the bill ourselves. After paying our parts, we ended up almost $10 short. One of our friends had to pay that amount. 

Needless to say they didn't deserve the 18% gratuity. Such an establishment should be able to split a moderately large bill and not ask their patrons to do mental math, or require one person to pay the bill. For a venue so close to two universities, they obviously do not cater to that demographic."}
{"text":"The nondescript door and the dark stairwell leading up seem to mask an amazing cafe that is quite a lot roomier than you would have thought! The seating and the spacing are ideal, and it isn't as crowded or outrageous as Snakes and Lattes. And while they charge no cover fee, unlike the aforementioned, there is a necessary order of $10 per person, which is easily met if you're ordering the sandwiches. 

My boyfriend and I visited this past Saturday during the afternoon, and although it was quiet more and more people were coming in. The service was good, but the food was even better! I had the Ribeye sandwich with cheese and it was delicious and flavourful! Although the game selection isn't as vast it makes it easier to make a decision! 

I would definitely go there again, the food, atmosphere were amazing. Next time I think I'll try the nachos!
Also, getting to keep the special dice at the end was a very nice touch :D"}
{"text":"They don't have a ton of game choices and the service is definitely meh.

We came in and ordered some lattes and she made me pick a different chair to sit in so that she could get to the other table a bit easier, although now I was sitting right in the isle.

We waited quite a bit of time to get our orders taken. The latte was good and we also got a dip as well, which was okay.

Again, the game selection is very weak. If you want a really good experience and fun atmosphere, try Snakes and Lattes. Role Play Cafe seemed to just be a cheap knock off and the ambiance was missing. It was cold feeling and it seemed slapped together, rather than a cozy place to come with friends or snuggle up with a date."}
{"text":"Do not come here if you have allergies because the staff obviously does not take dietary restrictions seriously.

I asked for a cotton candy steamer, with almond milk instead of regular milk. I also told them I cannot have dairy because I am lactose intolerant.

Instead I received my friend's order which was the London Fog. I asked our server if this was the cotton candy steamer and he said \"oh yes it is.\" I then asked, \"this is almond milk right?\" he replied \"yeah, yeah of course.\" He then left in a hurry. My friend came back from the bathroom, and told me I was drinking the drink that she ordered. Our server then came back with my supposed order, which was not a cotton candy steamer, but a peppermint mocha. My friend and I informed him of his mistake, and he apologized but insisted the drink I was holding was the cotton candy steamer. I asked another staff member who told me they didn't have cotton candy steamers available and I was indeed drinking a peppermint mocha. 

After a couple hours I experienced stomach pain because of the mix up. 

In addition, the service is incredible slow. My friend ordered a coke which took over 20 minutes to arrive. My other friend ordered a slice of cake which took over 30 minutes to arrive, and came with no forks, but the server was too much in a rush to notice. I honestly hate going after servers, but getting the staff's attention in this place is frustrating. 

The game selection is alright, but some tables kept several game boards at their table that weren't being used which really limited the selection on the shelves, 

I'm very disappointed by the experience my friends and I had today. As a student from a school nearby, rest assure I will NOT recommend this place at all to my colleagues."}
{"text":"Whatever happened about a month ago, it has changed. The servers were extremely friendly and happy to assist, and the managers were great. We asked them to change a song to Hot Line Bling because we were playing Truth or Dare Jenga, and our friend was dared to dance to that song for a minute. 

And I love the drinks there...I had the Sakura, which was beautiful and tasty at the same time. I also had the Earth drink, infused with soju. Now, the Earth drink is a virgin drink, but I wanted alcohol in it. The staff was happy to make the arrangements, so they added soju to it after the bartender decided it would be best. My god...the Asian pear juice (and other ingredients I can't remember) with soju...was just so delicious. I can't get over how good that was. I sincerely hope they'll put it in their menu as an official drink, because that is the best drink I've ever had. 

I will definitely be back for that Earth drink. Over and over again."}
{"text":"I used to really love going to this place, but it seems like they have revamped and not for the better. My girlfriend and I got there and it was so dim and the music was so loud we could barely hear each other talk, which isn't great for trying to play games. One game we played had different colored die but it was so dark i actually had to use the flashlight on my phone to see which was which! We used to love the drinks and food menu but the bacon latte and pizza we got there this time was just dissapointing and a waste of money. They never had the greatest game selection but that was ok cause it was a nice atmosphere and always a good time, but they've taken both of those redeeming aspects away, so, sadly I will not be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Pretty cool place. It's all about the vibe here. Have super unique cocktails here. Top notch beer. The staff are genuinely happy, and are good at their jobs. You sit at your table and play games it's just a good time. The staff will gladly explain how to play all of the games. Super clean modern decor. If any drawbacks drinks are a tad pricey."}
{"text":"Don't come here, it's our secret, because it's pretty awesome. 

There's no cover charge, but their food is inflated - personally I think this might be a more profitable business model. However, since it's still new, I think it might be subject to change. I don't mind, though, paying $10 for a pizza, $6 for a sandwich, $6 for a giant piece of cake, $6 for a really tasty giant bowl of popcorn and $4-5 for a tea/coffee. Just the psychology of it all. Food is good. 

I can't imagine we were there for 6 hours! We got a bunch of drinks, a cake and lunch for each of the 4 of us, with a total of about $70.

Sunday afternoon there was lots of space, but seemed to fill up around 5-6pm. It was a nice sunny fall day, but the large bay windows helped let in a lot of natural light which was nice. However, the interior lighting needs to change along with it. My eyes started hurting, might need to increase the lights as it gets darker. (Especially near the window). I would also say, it was quite cold at the window. Frozen hands and feet. 

We stayed a. long. time. even experienced 3 repeats of whatever playlist they had, and witnessed a shift change, however, they were really nice about it, never rushing, asking us if we need anything, chatting to us about the game. 

They have a good selection of games for all ages, like Catan, Dominion, Ticket to Ride, etc - but also simpler things like Ghost Blitz, Jenga. 
Highly recommend Hamsterrolle - you will not be disappointed. 

Suggestion: it would be cool, to help choose a game - to be able to ask or have a tip sheet for\"If you like Catan, you might like...\" to help choose the first game. 

This place with it's large tables also seems like a nice play to do work. But might get a little expernsive. Free wifi. 

We will be back for sure - especially when we're ready to discover a new game, or have something to do with a group. Might be a nice date activity too."}
{"text":"So it turns out that the last time I went, roll play had only given me their drinks menu; the nachos are still intact guys.

Dropped in around 7pm with my partner, and sooner after nestling into our seats, we were approached by a games master.  He was very patient and polite, offering us assistance in selecting our initial game.

If you're looking for party or classic [board / card] games, they are usually stacked on the shelving unit by the tv.  The strategic games can be found on the shelf by the entrance. 

Castle has removed it's additional seating, in the corner nook, for a: foosball table, and two other arcade-like standing units that I have seemed to forgotten - whoops."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and I like this place better than Snakes and Lattes for the following reasons:


A) They don't charge per hour and as long as you order $10 worth of food, you can stay.

B) The $10 is an average of the table so you can order a latte ($4 or so) if your table mates order more than $10.

C) The London Fog latte is amazing.  Its like Second Cup ++ level

D) The games are quite fun.

Verdict: Better than Snakes and Lattes with decent coffee and tea."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Over priced food and drinks for small morsels, period. I ordered a earl grey tea for 5.50 in a small glass and 5 dollars for a pizza i could of made in the microwave. Poor selection of games but my group was able to compensate. I highly dislike the new management and the way the managers pricing is for the  cafe. It is not clear about what is supposed to be. I would not go back to this place. Snakes and lattes is much much MUCH better."}
{"text":"I had a fun time at Roll Play Cafe.  Sharing the sentiment of other Yelpers, this place isn't overly rammed and is conveniently located just a block north of Yonge/Dundas beside what was formerly known as the Worlds Biggest Bookstore.

They have a wide selection of board games for play and to purchase, but not quite as extensive as Snakes & Lattes.

Upon getting seated, you'll be welcomed by a Connect Four game where you can start the action right away with your friend(s) or peruse their collection at the back.

In terms of bites, their snacks are basic, but they'll get you by.  I ordered the hummus and spinach.  They also offer pizza as well, but I never had a chance to try that.

One touch that I liked was that they served La Fin Du Monde beer! You can easily get tipsy off of these 8% beers when you have 3 or 4 (okay, I'm at light weight!)

Hip hip hooray for Roll Play Cafe!"}
{"text":"I was excited to sit in for hours to play some serious board games, but was disappointed when I walked in to discover that Roll Play has completely transformed... It is just a bar now. New owners, new menu, new type of restaurant.

This place is a chill hang out spot to have a drink with a couple of friends or a date. The new Asian culture decor is really neat and looks great with the dim lights. I found it to be a terrific place to catch up and have a real talk with someone because it isn't too crowded or loud, but still gives off a nice bar atmosphere which makes you want to drink. Our bartender was super nice and informative! 

Though this wasn't what I was expecting, my friend and I still had a good time. We each had one drink - I ordered the Lychee Martini and he ordered the King Of Toronto. They were both a bit strong, but we enjoyed them. The bill came up to $30, which I felt was overpriced. 

Overall, the new Roll Play (I think they're currently in the midst of revamping their image and changing their restaurant name) has an awesome and relaxed atmosphere if you are in the mood for some casual dranks. I wouldn't recommend it for food or games though!"}
{"text":"Great casual menu an fun atmosphere.  Roll Play was right in the heard of down town.  We went there while visiting Toronto and wanted a causal environment as we had our 8 and 10 year old boys with us.

My older son ordered a cheese pizza and my wife and I split the nachos.  Not sure if we were starving but those nachos were quite possibly the best we've ever had.  Oh and my sons ate the entire pizza.

The best part of this place is the atmosphere.  They have walls of games and you simply go get one and start playing.  Would recommend this for a relaxing night out with friends or family."}
{"text":"Man has this place changed; I don't believe it's a board game Cafe anymore and just a bar.  I went here as a venue Paint Nite used to host one of their events.  The Paint Nite staff was amazing and our group had a lot of fun but the staff at Roll Play Cafe were a sour note of the night.  Paint Nite or any people thinking about trying this place, AVOID!

Food: 1/5, ridiculous taste of a mocktail that is super pretentious and simply watered down strawberry juice.

Service: 0/5, there was just no service. They were rushing the paint nite folks, and were super nazi about the bill where I was asked three times to pay even though I had paid already, and just a nasty look on their face with a bitter tone. Had to ask for water several times with no luck in actually getting them after the first one.

Ambience: 1/5, cheap asian art decor with super tacky red everywhere.

Price: 1/5, really?!?! $10 for that drink that I gulped in one sip? That was like a 1000% mark up.  I got a mocktail and you shouldn't charge non-alchohol drinks at the similar price level as those that are.  They obviously don't know how to run a business with showing obvious marked-up prices for water drinks."}
{"text":"I think everything is outdated because this place is no longer a board game cafe. Instead, it's a beautiful bar that would be lit af on a weekend. Walking in, I decided that I would definitely take a future date here to swoon them. Lights are gorgeous, perfect atmosphere and soft & slow music.. definitely a date place. However, due to being forever alone, I came here with two of my buds for a drink after dinner in koreatown. 

A lot of stairs up, but it's worth it. Booths, tables, bar.. it's a large place that would be poppin' if it's filled. It was empty when we went, but we don't need anyone's company other than each other's. We ordered a variety of drinks; I personally had the sangria and the lychee martini. I enjoyed both a lot, but definitely the sangria (because there was more) and because you can actually taste the strong wine in it rather than it just being fruity. The lychee martini was amazing and I probably chugged it in under a minute because it was so good.

Service was on point, always coming to our table to check on us and even bring us water when we didn't ask for it.

Great place on edward st and would definitely stop by again sometime."}
{"text":"Roll Play Cafe has a great selection of board games and it's usually quite easy to get a table, unlike other trendy board game cafes in Toronto. If you're looking for a fun outing with friends, I highly recommend checking this place out. 

Benefits:
- The food / snack menu is delicious
- Amazing chai lattes
- No waiting around for a table for hours
- Super friendly staff
- Enough copies of the popular games
- Cool environment with fun music
- Super comfy seats available"}
{"text":"Convenient location (near Eaton Centre), good desserts and drinks, and lively atmosphere. I've been to Roll Play quite a few times now, and I always have a great time playing board games there. However, recently I've noticed that they decreased their selection of board games a bit, and they began to offer more alcoholic beverages. I guess they want to focus on what makes more money. I think Roll Play is great for more casual board gamers, who are looking to hang out with friends while doing something fun at the same time."}
{"text":"This new board game cafe sure has my vote.  After Snakes & Lattes took off in popularity, it just became too difficult to get seated there.  Luckily, Roll Play Cafe is here to save us all!  

The board game selection isn't nearly as large as Snakes' is, but it definitely has enough for everyone to enjoy.  The game masters were friendly and taught us how to play the games they recommended.  I ordered a mocha as well, which wasn't bad.  The atmosphere was nice and cozy, with booths available by the window (perfect for dates!).

Being much quieter and less crowded, Roll Play Cafe is a sure vote over Snakes & Lattes.  You'll be having the same amount of fun, minus having to wait for half an hour."}
{"text":"Nice place, very convenient location, lots of games to choose from.
We came midweek in the afternoon so we were the only people there. Service was good and we were there for a few hours."}
{"text":"We went and checked out the 4th and newest board game cafe to open in Toronto on Thurs Sept 19. We'd sent a invitation to some of our gaming friends and ended up with 9 of us stopping in throughout the evening. These are my thoughts:

 Game Collection: They have some gorgeous built-in shelving at both ends of the room and their collection is off to a great start, with lots of room for expansion. Scott was the game expert on staff that evening and he is very knowledgeable and wisely opinionated about games so I have no doubt that everyone walking in will find a few suitable games for their group from the selection available. We started off playing Garden Dice, a fun hour long game I had only learned the night before and wanted to teach Duncan. We then moved onto Skyline, a dice game I'd learned a few months ago but we don't own (yet?). After that we wanted to try something completely new and ended up with Czech Pub, a card playing party-ish game that will certainly be entertaining to more casual gamers. The other table played Click Clack, Riff Raff, and a few rounds of Dominion in the meantime.

  Atmosphere: The space is well decorated, spacious and very well lit. The tables were a comfortable size, maybe a little crowded once we added food and drinks but it was manageable. I loved the colour of the tables, since the muted grey makes even black and brown game pieces show up very well. Lighting should be a big consideration for a board gaming space and they have definitely done a much better job than their competitors in the city. The space was far from capacity during our visit but based on the furniture lay-out, I think they could be full and still feel spacious and uncrowded.

 Cover Model: They are still working out the details of their pricing model, but the way it was presented is that there is no cover charge or sitting fee, as long as your group is actively ordering from their menu. The first 2 hours are free with any purchase and after that you might be charged $3/hour if you are not continuing to order. I think that is a very fair approach from a business stand-point, but I think it needs some work from a customer service perspective since it isn't clear enough and actually caused our group to delay placing orders on a few occasions to ensure we were ordering in the next time window. Making me think about my orders in relation to time probably meant I ordered slightly less than I otherwise would have and I still wasn't confident about what would be shown on the bill. It does sound like they are continuing to explore options and I hope to see improvement on this model.

 Food: We hadn't eaten dinner so decided to order a custom pizza from their menu, with sweet peppers, italian sausage and bacon (you can pick any 3 toppings plus choose any type of sauce and cheese). It was delicious and the super thin crust was crisped to perfection. We shared a bubble pop waffle afterwards that is served with some fresh fruit and a nutella banana whipped cream! Everyone who goes there needs to try this out. We also ordered a chai latte, Hank's soda, salted caramel macaroons, and a red velvet cake pop - all of which were as expected or better. The prices were a bit higher than I expected, and high enough to keep me from coming here regularly, but certainly still reasonable as an occasional evening out.

Overall, I would definitely recommend checking this place out, and I'm looking forward to a few return trips myself. :-)"}
{"text":"Good board games, low price of admission, and a good atmosphere in general. Now, you might wonder why I'm leaving this place a One-Star Rating. Simply put, they kicked us out for no reason.

In their defence, we were a rather large group (about 8 people if I remember correctly), and due to the fact that we came to this place right after dinner, we didn't order all that much from their menu. Furthermore, we were playing Monopoly, and you know how people get when they start playing Monopoly. We were definitely on the louder side of the spectrum.

We were under the impression that, like many other board game cafes in Toronto, you pay the price of admission and you can pretty much stay for as long as you want to. Although this place pretends to operate under the same business model, if you read the very fine print at the bottom of their menu, THEY RESERVE THE RIGHT TO KICK YOU OUT AT ANY POINT IN TIME FOR NO GOOD REASON.

Throughout our game, the waitresses constantly came up to our table to ask if we wanted to order anything. We made it pretty clear from the get-go that we were here to play board games and nothing else (at a place called ROLL PLAY if I may add. Go figure). After a while, when the place began filling up, and the staff realized that there are other parties (who were likely more willing to order from the menu) who wanted our table, they nonchalantly told us that we have 30 minutes to finish up and leave. That was it.

Don't get me wrong - I like this place. It's a great place to hang out and play board games. However, how the staff treated my specific group of friends is total BS. Needless to say, I'm never coming back here again."}
{"text":"Read as 3.5

This was the first board games cafe I've ever been to, so I was definitely, very excited for this! Came here with 2 other friends on a Friday afternoon/early evening and was rather surprised to see only 2 other tables there playing.  Even when we left at around 6pm, the place was barely half full!

First off, the entrance is pretty hidden.  It's on the second floor, and the stairs/entrance in general is fairly sketchy looking. Once you get inside though, the blue walls and decor in general are really warm and the atmosphere is rather friendly.

There are around 20's tables for 4's; although some of them can be put together, it might not be perfect for groups if you want to be sure to get a table.

There was a fair game selection, but there could have been more of certain ones. For example, they have multiple Settlers of Catan, but only one beat-up version of Cards Against Humanity...definitely something there could be more of.

Service was adequate, water refills and general check-ups were fairly frequent, but expected considering the place was really only half full.  I ordered a hot apple cider for $4 and was pleasantly surprised by its size - it was big, almost the size of a soup bowl! Tasted relatively nice, on par.  Our group also ordered a margherita pizza for about $10.98. It was smaller than your average pizza, but nice for splitting across the table. Tasted a bit bland and the crust was fairly burnt on some of the pieces. Overall, the food was nothing too special to go for.

They charge a total cover fee of $5 per person, not per hour, so it's definitely a good deal on that end. A fairly nice experience worth the price, I'll probably come back here in the future, but keep an eye out for nicer ones in the area too!"}
{"text":"If you want to spend some time playing games but don't want to wait in line for two hours, go over to the Touristy area of Yonge-Dundas square where (as of this writing) surely you will get a table.

Situated right beside what will be the former Worlds Biggest Bookstore, is a nondescript door that leads UPSTAIRS to Roll Play Cafe. Once up there you will find a huge open space with several tables, booths and casual sitting areas where groups big and small can partake in a game of Monopoly, or Risk, or any game they have to offer.

They have a plenty full of food and drink offerings as well, including ones of the alcoholic variety. They got sweet and savory foods. There is a minimum charge of $10pp, the menu says \"peak hour\" only but I suspect it's \"all hours\" (I could be wrong).

Regardless, it would be good if you wanted to have lunch or a couple drinks and plenty of fun playing board games here.

They also have a 10% off if you check-in using facebook, foursquare or our favorite of ALL time YELP."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, and my experiences have really improved here. Once arrived around 6pm and stayed til close at 1am. It said 2 hour limit during peak hours, but it was never fully packed. I liked how it was a lot less busy than Snakes and Lattes. Played ticket to ride, king of tokyo, jenga, Lost cities, ghost blitz and Mr. Jack, and it was lots of fun. Used to get free dice at the end as a souvenir, but I don't think they do that anymore.

The place had a really great atmosphere. Really spacious and I love how they play old music from like 2006, really brings me back. The waiters and their staff were also very friendly and offered to teach us new games. He explained munchkin really well, and even joined in for the first round.

The board game collection was mediocre. If you're intense board gamer like me, they might not have your favourite games, but they definitely have some new ones you could try. 

The food didn't used to be that great, but they recently changed their menu, and the food has definitely improved. It's pretty affordable and it's really good and flavourful. The pizza is great! I think they've also recently changed their charge to $5 per person (Snakes and Lattes style) instead of a min $10 purchase of food, which I appreciate since you're not forced to order food anymore.

Overall a great up and coming board game cafe, try it out early before it gets super popular!"}
{"text":"I came with a party of 9 on a friday night and they weren't taking reservations. Understandable as that seems to be the norm for the other board game cafes, but they did say that if they were to take that many people they would've required us to do this under a corporate event with a $20 minimum per person. 

We did choose this place to celebrate two people's birthdays due to the reviews, but we did bring our own cake and hostess told us that to serve the 'cake' we would've had to do a $20 plating fee (I even brought the disposable utensils, plates and the cake was already cut!). She was really regretful, but it was not her fault. I believe to compensate, they also let us stay a lot longer without buying more drinks/food.

I felt like this was a step down from Snakes and Lattes. Food was good, but a bit pricey. We didn't really need very much instruction as we were fairly experienced. But the selection was a bit lacking and for sets like Dominion, they only had one base set...but multiple expansions. Meaning, if somebody took the base game, there was 0 ability to play any of the expansions. It was also really uncomfortably hot inside, which doesn't seem like it was the problem with others here.

Atmosphere was good, there was a lot of excitement. Decor was great and very modern/clean. Service was good as well and they were attentive. This place is good provided you have somebody who knows the game and is interested in playing. Do not expect the waitresses to teach you how to play the game. The only reason why the rating was lower than a 4 was due to the problems with accommodating the group."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: 4/5 hidden next to BMV, the place is spacious, offers a super fun environment to hang with friends, they have two walls of board games to choose from, tables are widely design so that you have enough space to play 

Food:
1. Oreo cake $8.00- it's the perfect amount of sweet, a tiny bit dry, but overall totally worth it 

2. Meat lovers pizza $9.50- absolutely amazing!! Definitely a must try. The bread they used was crunchy, good amounts of toppings, and they topped it with some fresh veggies and siracha mayo which made it absolutely perfection! 

Overall: although they have the min. $10 per person charge, it's absolutely worth it to come hang with friends and grab light snacks to eat. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Hidden fees and everything is way overpriced and mediocre

Went with my girlfriend and we had a very tiny pizza that wasn't even good for 10 bucks, they forced us to buy a drink PLUS and additional 5$ per person for playing games (they didn't inform us about that). Makes no sense that they charge you for playing when they force you already to buy a drink. Almost 40 $ in total for 2 hours of playing boardgames. You'll rather buy the boardgame"}
{"text":"I would love to give this place 4 stars. The inconsistency and confusion with their table service drove our two tables crazy.

There are great things about this place: clean, modern, spacious and the food is actually, better than some restaurants I have gone to. 

I do wish they would place as much attention to that as their table service. Even when I went up to the counter to order, they told me to go back to my table and wait. Which also took forever.  None of us knew what to do, if you couldn't even order at their counter. Very odd. 

Snakes and Lattes has a world of games and you will notice a marked difference in what is available for you to choose from.

If they work on customer service and selection, this place has good potential with a little tweaking."}
{"text":"I like this place. In fact, I like it a lot. My friends and I found it one night and it's a bit hidden so it was kinda like finding a treasure (just cheesy things). Mind you, I had never been here before their changes in which it was more like a \"board game cafe\" and it seems to really irritate others that it's changed so much. I like how it's a cocktail + board game cafe though, you don't really see that. The service is impeccable and every time I come I'm greeted with warm smiles in which the employees genuinely try to get to know my friends and I. Super nice. I've had an incident where my sister accidentally spilled my lychee martini and the server (I regrettably forget his name!) quickly cleaned it up and came back with a new martini! They also give our free popcorn occasionally (I'm sure this is just to get people thirsty and order drinks but hey it works!) and they don't charge for board games (at least the times I've been they haven't!).

The food is good but the portions are tiny. My friend ordered the popcorn shrimp and it probably came with 6 tiny popcorn shrimps. The duck flat bread is very good, definitely worth a try. The drinks are moderately priced but if you're looking for a cheap place to get hammered, this is probably not where you want to go!"}
{"text":"PROS:
- Great location near Dundas Square!
- The place is quite spacious and clean for a board game cafe. For smaller groups they have booth seating. For larger groups they're able to pool together tables.
- We arrived at 7pm on a Saturday and there were still a few tables available. It's usually near impossible at other popular board game places to get a table during peak hours. So we were surprised that we could get one for a large group.
- Drinks are not horrid compared to Snakes and Lattes. They're okay but around $5 for coffee/hot drinks.

CONS:
- Before getting a table, we asked the staff what the pricing was like. He told us it was a $5 cover per person, and cost of food and drinks would just be additional on top. After 45 min, the staff came over and told us that there will be a 1-drink minimum per person on TOP of the $5 cover... We mentioned that this was not communicated to us at the beginning and it's not fair to enforce that after we've already started playing. The staff said they normally don't need to enforce it because other tables tend to order things. But since they wanted our table to order MORE they were going to enforce it. Now we would NOT have had a problem with it if they told us from the start that it was $5 cover plus 1 drink minimum. It's all about transparency. We were all coming from an early dinner too so most people were full and wanted to order drinks later on in the night. It's not the money thing that's an issue, but their pushiness and lack of consistency and communication that really put us off. 
- When I asked if their hot beverages could be \"iced\" instead, they said they could do it. Later when the bill came, they added a $1.50 surcharge for the ice without telling me when I ordered it. I don't appreciate the lack of customer service here.
- Drink service is slow as most board game places are.
- We asked the staff to suggest some games for us... TWICE!  Both times he said he would, but then would disappear and never come back. Whereas other board game places, the staff will suggest and even teach groups how to play and really show their passion for board games. 
- Board game selection wasn't very good. Some were duplicates too. A few boxes were missing pieces as well. 
- We had to ask for water for the table 3 times and only came 2 hours later when we were about to leave... Maybe this was an off night, but our server couldn't do even one task that we asked him to. 

OVERALL:
This place has potential - the space is quite nice. 
They should stick to a consistent and transparent pricing policy instead of doing it on a case-by-case basis.
I would suggest re-training staff in customer service and making sure they have knowledge of most board games. 
And buy a larger variety of board games and replacing ones with missing pieces.
Even though this place has been open for over a year, I didn't see any lineup on Saturday night, even when we left at 9pm. That's good for those who want a table, but it could also reflect the popularity of this place... or lack of I should say."}
{"text":"A limited selection of games compared to Snakes and Lattes, but I do like that this is a little less crowded. Service is good, although a little strange when we entered and as a party of 6 requested to be seated at the tables, but the server mentioned that we needed to sit at the couches in case it gets busy later. Pardon me ma'am, but it is 7pm on a Monday night and you only have one other table taken up...ain't nobody showin up now to start a party.

Decent food options as well I must say, so all in all they are just OK. I would still go back to Snakes and Lattes however for a games night experience."}
{"text":"They advertise themselves as a \"board game cafe\", but eep, I gotta think twice before I go there again.

We went in with a new board game we just bought, and we asked the waitress if we could play our own games instead. The waitress nodded and said we could, but we will still be charged $5 each, which we were fine with. Well, since it is a new game, it is expected that we do not know the rules and are learning on the go while setting up. 

All of us ordered a drink, but we were still constantly bugged by the waitress to order food. After like the nth time, a different waitress came and told us if we don't order any food, we will be asked to pay $20 EACH for the bill. Thanks for letting us know! Apparently desserts count and only one of us need to order, but $20 per person threat is still a little low. 

We did end up ordering some food about an hour or two in (our food order was wrong but we didn't really care much), but we feel pressured into something we didn't want. Our water was never refilled, and no one really paid attention to us after we ordered our food.

About 3 hours in, we were told to wrap up our game because it is a Saturday night, and other people are waiting. It is a good reason, and we do understand why they wanted us out, but a little warning at the beginning would have been nice. 

I get a feeling that if we ordered more food and drink items, they would not have cared. Last time we were here, we ordered a ton more food and we stayed way longer (from early afternoon to 8pm). The staff was attentive and way friendlier. 

I personally would not go there in the near future. Snakes & Lattes here I come."}
{"text":"The ratings on this place is skewed by the fact this used to be board game cafe which recently converted to a cocktail bar that happens to have some board games -- and all the ratings are dumped into the same bucket.

I never went to this place as a board game cafe, but did want to check it out since the bar manager use to bartend in Lan Kwai Fong (the spot to start/end shit-faced adventures) in Hong Kong and makes a Yuanyang (HK milk tea & coffee drink) inspired cocktail.

It's a combo of infused Earl Grey gin, espresso and evaporated milk.  Did kinda remind of my a yuanyang, but felt a tad close to Bailey's.  That said, the waitress did ask if I wanted it 'sweet', 'bold' or 'regular' - I went with regular, so I might have to switch it up next time.

The decor reminds me of Cold Tea.  However, I'm not saying it's a copy - it's hard not to get the same influences when you're going for a 'hyper-real' Hong Kong feel.  It's like you've walked into a Wong Kar-Wai movie poster.

We default to cocktail bar classics like Negronis (3 oz for $8!) and Old Fashioned after sampling some of the more exotic stuff.

The staff were very eager to please - checking up with us constantly if we enjoyed our drinks.  After some prodding, my buddy hesitantly said one of the drinks was 'tad watered down' for him.  Without further prompting, waitress later came back with a complimentary, stronger version of the same cocktail.  And the bar manager himself came by, introduced himself and checked on us.  That's great service.

They said they decided to move from a board game cafe to cocktail lounge/event venue recently (there's a stage at the corner of the room).  And they only kept the simpler games that didn't take all day to play from their board games days.  For what it's worth, I'm happier there's a nice cocktail lounge in the area rather than yet another escape room/board game cafe.

Harking back to their board game days, I dig the fact they have a dice roll menu - roll the dice and you're randomly given a drink on the list of 12.  Roll a 12 and you get a Flaming Lamborghini - props for properly 'weighing' the roll odds. 

Overall, I really like the spot and it seems like a great date joint with the ambiance and alchohol and board games to pass the time.

They only run $5 happy hour specials from 5 - 7pm - so will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I organized a birthday night for myself and 14 of my friends and I can say for certain, the service is outstanding here. Our servers wanted to make sure we were having a great night and the cocktails were flowing. They attended to us when we needed them and checked up on us throughout the night. The real icing on the cake was at the end of the night, they surprised us with a round of shots for the whole group! For a restaurant/bar business to treat us, for such a large amount of people, it really is as good as it gets."}
{"text":"My first ever time there was great. Friday afternoon and the place was empty, I had a hours to kill before a dinner reservation so my date and I chose to test this place out. This was our first ever board game style Cafe and our waiter (or game master) was pretty excited to give us the run down. He also picked our first game for us, when we asked for a recommendation. This guy was stoked from start to finish. Very into explaining the rules and teaching us to play. His enthusiasm definitely rubbed off on us and we were all smiles the whole time. I was a little worried we might get bored but the game master was always around with some more energy. We had some drinks and the margarita pizza which is pretty tasty. The selection wasn't amazing though. We ended up staying five hours anyways and left just as it was picking up. We didn't get the name of the game master but we're definitely going again. Good date spot I highly recommend"}
{"text":"Visited a little under a month ago. 

Food was subpar and quite expensive. We ordered the nachos and had the strawberry cheesecake. The board game selection wasn't that great either. Our waitress was really sweet though. She was fairly attentive the entire night, routinely coming around and asking how everything was. 

What I did like about Roll Play Cafè was how it looked on the inside. Very clean and lots of room to move around. Hopefully their food gets better (to match the prices) and their board game selection improves. Lots of potential - great location too!"}
{"text":"Horrible. Beginning to end. Changed us $5 for green tea? Really ? Food came an hour later- charged us 5 dollars ahead to play the board games. Each person has to buy a drink and a food item and they have to pay $5 each person to play the games. Bad customer service. Horrible !"}
{"text":"Our Orders: Sangria Pitcher ($60), Pop corn chicken, Bubble waffle  (snacks less than $10 each)

Pros
+ Friendly staff. Checked on us at every 10-15 min interval. We didn't quite appreciate the plastic cups they gave us to accompany our pitcher of sangria though...
+ W/R. the dim lighting in the restroom was kind of cool. 2 for ladies,  1 gents, 1 unisex. 

Cons
- Ambiance. Roll play went from being a family friendly typical games board cafe to a lounge/sports bar. I didn't appreciate playing my game over loud music and sports fans cheering in my ear. Overall conflicting concepts. 

- Marketing Concept. I seldomly rate businesses lowly for their marketing strategy but this one really peeved me off. When we first arrived, we thought we were at the wrong place because of the obscure ancient Japanese articles on the wall leading to the lounge. 

There were random Chinese words on the menu but not every item was translated (which begs to question why it is even there when a Chinese person wouldn't actually be able to order from the menu). \"Asian\" spinach drip? No such thing exists. As a group, we awkwardly looked around for half an hour and went \"is anyone offended...what is this?\" collectively. 

An \"Asian\" oriented business that pisses off the patrons whom culture they are advertising? This is what we call a \"tricks white people\" business. 

- Menu. I was misled undo believing they sell bubble waffles from blogTO. That needs to be updated...their menu selection is so small that it's visually non existent. 

With a reduced games selection and overall rowdy atmosphere, it was hard for us as a group to enjoy our experience. Roll Play tries really hard to be a lot of things and has a racially offensive marketing strategy. Roll play commercializes watered down stereotypes of Asian culture. What an epic fail. I expected more, especially from a business situated in the heart of Toronto, a diverse mosaic of people & cultures. 

We left to go to Snakes & Lattes shortly after. Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Roll Play Cafe is the newest board game cafe in Toronto, and boy, does it ever deliver! I was super impressed with my entire experience here. 

Roll Play gets brownie points right off the bat for not having an hourly fee or cover charge, so long as you are eating and/or drinking. Considering if you are spending hours at a time at an establishment like this, and are very likely going to want to eat or drink, I think it's a fantastic idea. 

The space is big and bright - filled with standard tables and chairs, some loungey couches and chairs, as well as booths. You could find space for groups both small and large pretty easily. The decor is modern and clean (as are the bathrooms!)

The food is by far the best food I've had at a board game cafe. I tried the pizza and it was delicious (and full of tons of options!), as well as a hot chocolate that I gobbled up quite fast and was also very good. My friends sampled a few other things from the menu, all with positive feedback. 

The prices for the some of the items (desserts, drinks) are a teeny bit high, but I think the lack of a cover/fee makes up for it. 

The service was amazing. Friendly, attentive, full of knowledge and game suggestions, and willing to just talk shop if you want to nerd out with them for a bit about gaming. 

The board game selection is good, but not quite as good as some of the other board game cafés in Toronto - and this is the only thing keeping my review from 5 stars. However, since Roll Play just opened a couple of weeks ago, I am positive their library will grow. 

I am definitely going to be frequenting this establishment. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"After a ridiculous experience at Snakes and Lattes, I'm very anti board game cafe so I was a bit hesitant going to Roll Play despite my friend's birthday, but it was alright.

No cover charge but everyone has to order something. And everyone means everyone. Tea and coffee range from $3-5; sandwiches and pizza $5-10. We didn't order food, but the tea and coffee were just okay. 

My first impression was that Roll Play's space reminded me of a university food court. Harsh lighting, blue paint, food court tables...bleh. Not the warm and wood atmosphere at S&L, but there were seats and our group of 8 was able to sit down right away. 

The assortment of games is still expanding but we still had fun playing a round of Operation before we got our hands on Cards Against Humanity. 

Tip: Bring cash since they don't split bills. 

I'll probably come back here when I want to try out another game."}
{"text":"Second board games cafe I've been.  Interior deco pretty modern, service was really great.  Waiter and waitresses were super attentive and brought us whatever we needed really quickly.  A decent selection of board games - we didn't have to pay to play that day because of a special promotion.  Usually it's $5 I believe?  The nachos were okay, they're good for accomodating large groups too.  Def could come here as a fun group activity - right beside the BMV near Eaton.  Pretty easy to miss if you don't look for the small sign!   

Won a free board game that night too because we instagrammed/tweeted them haha - thanks Roll Play!"}
{"text":"Roll Play Cafe is a chill and not over-crowded place to play board games and enjoy a drink and snack.  They have a limited assortment of interactive games and a menu that they are still experimenting with.  I think the limited assortment of games can be a good thing as it cuts down on the time debating about what to play and more time is spent actually playing the game.  What I like about Roll Play Cafe is the atmosphere.  I don't feel claustrophobic and rushed when I'm playing games.  

I'm looking forward to when their menu becomes more stable, it needs a bit of soul-searching.  Oh and they just recently got their liquor licence so that can bring the gaming to a whole other level and I'm looking forward to that too."}
{"text":"My new go-to place for board games. A minimum food charge of $10 per person is a pretty good deal, considering the quality of ingredients that they use. 

The vegetarian pizzas were outstanding - fresh arugula, tasty tomato sauce, marinated button mushrooms. Even the foccacia is made fresh on site! 

The chai latte was also yummy. I just wished it were bigger, because I guzzled it pretty fast!"}
{"text":"Great good and drinks! The staff is really nice. Not many games but the games they do have are awesome! Check it out :)"}
{"text":"Came in here with a group of friends to discuss new board games and start a few sessions. The place is well lit, decorated and has ample seating which is a plus in this location. However, the wait staff were terrible and supposed \"rules\" handed down from new management were extremely aggressive and uninviting to the point where we left to find another  venue.

The menu is a little too simplified and provides no value or quality over any of the high end resto-pubs in the immediate vicinity. There's nothing new or innovative about this place aside from the rather arrogant and hostile nature to which they treat guests, very unusual considering they're trying to attract board gamers.

Bad attitude, bad service, bad experience go elsewhere if you actually want to have fun. Two stars for location, cleanliness and ample seating."}
{"text":"Cool place to hang out and play games. The emphasis in this place (as compared to others around Toronto) is on the food, so the game selection is a bit smaller and the menu a bit larger. This is great if you want to eat and you're not a super gamer.

It's $5 for unlimited games with the purchase of food (unsure if this is per person?). We tried the nachos and the Margherita pizza. The nachos were a bit too healthy for us, with chopped lettuce on top and not enough cheese. Additionally, you had to request beans and pay an extra $3 for them. I'd skip them next time. However, the pizza was very tasty. It had fresh slices of Roma tomatoes on each slice, with a fresh basil leaf. Definitely recommend it! The dessert case looked great...next time we're there, I'm sure one of those slabs of cake will be in our future. 

Prices are a little high ($5 for a regular cup of tea, not a pot?), so larger groups or groups with kids who are cost conscious may want to be aware."}
{"text":"Roll Play is a great spot, and I think it's just a matter of time before it becomes more popular.

Most notably, the service is exceptional. Each server brings a healthy amount of enthusiasm to the job, eagerly sharing their favourite dishes. Ours recommend the Peking duck flatbread, which was surprisingly good.

If you order a cocktail, you'll almost certainly meet the bartender (and possibly co-owner), Barry, who personally visits tables to explain the intricacies of each drink and gather feedback. You can tell he genuinely cares. There are countless creative drinks available. We ordered a cocktail tower for the table (I forget the name), which had several distinct layers. Each glass we poured had a different colour and taste.

If you haven't yet visited Roll Play, be sure to check it out. It's run by people who care, and it shows."}
{"text":"When I first found out about Roll Play Cafe, it became one of the top cafes I wanted to visit. Being a fan of Snakes and Lattes, I wanted to know how Roll Play Cafe (and other board game cafes such as Castle Board Game Cafe) differed. I was fortunate enough to be invited to come in to review!

Roll Play Cafe recently opened this past September in the heart of downtown Toronto. The owners were inspired by the cafe board game trend in South Korea and wanted to open their own, before Snakes and Lattes became popular. They felt that adults didn't have many social venue options to relax and have a good time with friends. The motto of the cafe is to offer good food, fun games, and create long lasting relationships!

There are some house rules within the cafe that you should know beforehand (which is also at the bottom of the menu). Unlike Snakes and Lattes, there is no sitting fee. However, there is a $10 food purchase minimum. No worries though, Roll Play Cafe offers a wide selection of food. This folks, is a cafe with restaurant-quality food! There is also a two hour maximum stay during the rush hour. However, if you come in when it is less busy, you are welcomed to stay for as long as you'd like. The owners want to give all customers an equal opportunity to enjoy their stay at the cafe without having to wait for hours to be seated. As well, your two hours start once your food order has been punched into the computer, not when you are seated.

Two of my friends, my boyfriend and I settled in around 2:30 PM. Being the cafe blogger, I wanted to try a hot drink from their menu. The Raspberry Truffle tasted as delicious as it sounded! It was sweet enough where I didn't need to add sugar and had a yummy raspberry flavour. I got to sample the Vanilla Ice Cream Float with Black Cherry and the Strawberry Ice Cream Float with Coke and I enjoyed both! I'm not sure which one I preferred more, but I definitely recommend both of the floats. The Passion Fruit Italian Soda was a miss since I generally found Italian soda bland for my taste. However, you can decide for yourself by trying it out at the cafe if you love Italian soda. My friend did comment that the Vanilla Latte was top quality and had a balance of flavours (he used to be in culinary arts, so he should know!). During this time, we went through a couple of rounds of a card game called Bang!, which I have yet to fully grasp.

I really enjoyed the signature Roll Play Pizza that I had ordered. The pizza was soft and chewy with many fresh toppings. The Meat Lovers Pizza was also very tasty that my friend ordered a second platter! I felt the pizzas were priced just right for the portions given and they covered the $10 minimum purchase easily. My boyfriend liked his Roasted Pesto Chicken Sandwich, which I definitely recommend for a nice lunch since it includes a bit of salad as well. He preferred the sandwich over the pizza, but I didn't get a chance to taste the sandwich to compare. If you end up buying a sandwich and a pizza here, let me know which one you like better! By the time we rolled around to dessert while playing Personally Incorrect (similar to Cards Against Humanity), our bellies were happily full. We tried our best to get through the cakes as much as we could. I preferred my boyfriend's Cookies and Cream over my Strawberry and Chocolate. Maybe it was because his cake had a piece of Oreo on it, haha.

Towards the end of our stay, the game master (who comes in during the busy hours, usually Thursday to Saturday around 6 PM) helped chose the King of Tokyo to play and explained it thoroughly. I would be picking up this game again in the future because it's simple yet very engaging. There was an intense battle where everyone wanted their monster to be the King of Tokyo! I luckily won a round although I forgot to keep track of my monster's points.

Everyone all agreed that we had a fantastic time and we would definitely be coming back in the future! Roll Play Cafe created a memorable experience for me and it was a great way to bond and re-connect with friends which I haven't seen for a long time. I just wish I had another stomach to try more of their food because on their Facebook page, I keep seeing things I should've ordered! I forgot to try out their Bubble Pop Waffle so if anyone had tried it, what was your opinion?

So if you decide to head to Roll Play Cafe, my advice is to go during the afternoon and on a weekday if you want to avoid the full house and two-hour sitting limit. Top menu items I highly recommend trying out are their pizzas and floats. Also, try to get your hands on King of Tokyo if you need a game recommendation. They no longer have Cards Against Humanity, but they do have Personally Incorrect, which is practically the same game."}
{"text":"The atmosphere of the place was nice and comfortable.

However,  I would recommend them adding \"minimum spend\" in order to access their board games. When they only specify for group of 8 and above, and nothing written regarding minimum spend for smaller groups.

I hope they'll work out all their kinks after their soft opening is over.

Also, they no longer serve their bubble waffles :("}
{"text":"I  have been a regular at Snakes and Lattes though the down side is it is a bit out of the way so i was quite happy to see another one open just north of the Eaton Centre. so here goes my 2 cents:

Location and decor:
- the connivence and location is ideal as it is prob a 5 min walk from Dundas station. It is located upstairs so the first time might be tricky to find.
- inside you will find a very new and modern looking set up with great 4 man booths lining the window and large tables for 6 to 8 people in the middle. There are also a few couches as well

Food:
- we went for lunch and games so I was happy the menu offer more than just cold sandwiches. We ordered meat lovers pizza and egg salad sandwich.
- both were great. The pizza was spicy and hot from the oven while  the sandwich was served on a nice bun.
- so food is  a plus

Games:
- I was a little disappointed with the game selection as they seemed to have a much smaller selection - maybe around 30ish games. they had some of popular stuff like Settlers and Ticket to ride but it lacks some of the more unique games
- Compared to Snakes and Lattes, it probably had 20% of their libray
- it worked ok for us as we played Pandemic

As others have mentioned, there  is a $10 charge but i didnt get a sense there was a time limit. If you oreder a dessert and coffee, that should put you over the limit. in general, I would give it 4 stars for food but only 2 stars for games so it evens out to 3. they have some game  people who can teach you but it is not as extensive.

So, Snakes and Lattes still sets the bar as my gaming cafe but we may come back if they expand their selection."}
{"text":"This place has a cool vibe with its Asian-inspired decor. If you're looking for a board game cafe, you're going to be sorely disappointed but if you're looking more for a bar with a small selection of games, then this is the right place to check out. 

Our server was pleasant and recommended some drinks for us from the extensive menu. Most drinks were around $10 and I got the lychee martini which was super sweet and fruity, pretty much what I expected. We got some complimentary snacks to nibble on while we played \"Concept\", which turned out to be pretty fun (for groups of 4+ only).

 I'll probably return to try some other drinks."}
{"text":"This place has really gone downhill since I've last been here. Lots of things got changed, for the worse. 

1) It used to be that if you bought food that would cover the play. Now you have to buy food/drinks and pay $5 cover fee. The food isn't cheap! The cheapest thing on the menu is a $5 coke. So the absolute minimum you can pay is $10

2) They no longer have the games on the wall, you have to ask the waitress to bring it to you. Its also a very limited selection (like 15-20 games). My group wanted to play this one game and the waitress had to go and ask another table if they were done with the game. What sort of board game cafe only has one of each game? Their selection was really really disappointing, they didn't even have cards against humanity, catan, risk, clue, etc. We've never heard of most of the games available. 

3) They refused to split the bill and refused to help us split up the cash. Also enforced a mandatory 18% tip for groups of 6+ people. This was written in tiny print at the bottom of the menu, and came as a big shock to everyone in my group. 

4) Rude wait staff. She kept coming around and asking us to order, refused to help us split the bill or pay separately, brought the food out after ages, and when we tried to get her attention she just looked at us and disappeared behind the bar. The new rules they enforce are extremely strict. 

There are definitely better options for board game cafes in Toronto. Roll play cafe doesn't have anything special except perhaps for it's location. Overpriced, poor selection of games, rude waitresses. I wouldn't ever take my friends here."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful time and I left with a positive experience. I will definitely be come back!

First off, it's $5/person and you can stay as long as you want. If you order food that'd be counted on top of the $5. They have specials too depending on which day you go. I went on a Monday so it was half price on wings with the purchase of a drink (doesn't have to be alcoholic). The staff was very helpful and attentive. (Probably because it was super empty yesterday..) But nevertheless, it was a positive environment to be in. However, I was kind of disappointed with their nachos... Just not the best nachos in town... 

I have 2 games that I highly recommend: Monopoly Deal and Indigo. They're strategic yet easy to learn and super fun! 

Also, if you have a group then you should definitely play taboo. It's one of my favourite games to play with friends besides Monopoly deal. Oh, I just have to mention that Taboo can never go wrong with some alcohol.. :) or with any games actually haha."}
{"text":"We were there on a Saturday and it was really slow. We were first patrons at 9pm. Drinks were expensive and small. It has potential. Service was very attentive. Atmosphere was off beat."}
{"text":"Roll Play is located near Y&D square - a spacious, cozy place to hang out with friends , and not to mention.. THEY SERVE ALCOHOL!!!!!

The selections of board game is wide, service from the game master is impeccable. He is more than happy to make suggestions and he even brings the game to you so you don't even have to get up to the game wall. 

They do serve food but it's on the pricier side - $20 for 3 hours of game play with no purchase of food. OR $5 for 3 hours with a purchase of food/drink. it might sound like pretty reasonable but a pizza goes for a hefty $20."}
{"text":"I've been to roll play cafe since 2013...
It's really sad to see how they've fallen and transitioned into present times.

Before, as you can read from other reviews, it was a really good place for a great selection of food, a place to relax and play a wide variety of board games. 

Now, they've transitioned to a \"bar\" with board games (only have about 10 games to choose from) before they had around 30-40 games. 

Because I've had previous good experience from roll play after a birthday celebration we decided to transition to roll play for board games and conversation. 

Majority of people there was between 2-4. We were a party of 12!! They told us all of us had to order something in order to play board games (fair enough) 
But their menu has mainly alcoholic drinks and about 5 food choices. ONE member of our party of 12 was underage (16 years old) and we had just ate dinner and she didn't want to drink anything.

They forced us to order something on her behalf. And kept harping us 5-6 more times to order something. 

We were not inclined to order anything else more than what we had ordered per person. 

For example, I ordered a cranberry vodka and it was about 80% filled with ice... $6.50 + tax + 18% gratuity charge over parties of 6. 

The staff decided to interrupt us again and They came to us a 7th time to ask us to order something for her (the 16 yr old). She threatened us and said if we don't order anything she would charge us $20 to just play board games! WTF I was extremely frustrated and asked them what's the cheapest thing on their menu? Because I'll order it, charge it to my bill, don't even give it to us and please stop bothering us about that. 

The manager came up to us to apologize about the situation. And that was it. Shaun, is a nice guy but he does not know how to operate a business. He had bought out his partner and removed all the charismatic connection, and  good experience there was for customers. 

Offered us nothing in compensation, they said \"we gave you free popcorn\" and we aren't charging you for the little girl. Sorry about that. 
Really roll play? Really? 
Bad drinks, bad service, bad food. What else is good? 

Oh, and they refuse to split the bill amongst us. Gave us a huge group bill and we had to calculate it ourselves. 

If you made it this far...
 in conclusion: ROLL PLAY CAFE IS NOW A BAR, it used to be great but due to a change in management has really become a huge disappointment.

{"text":"Roll Play Bar & Lounge started off as a board game cafe when they first opened, but has since re-branded itself into Toronto's first Asian cocktail bar. There was a change in ownership, and they decided to transition to a bar/lounge late last year. Roll Play Bar & Lounge now offers an extensive list of high-end Asian cocktails, wine & beer, while still offering some complimentary board games for customers to play. The location is slightly hidden, as it's located on the second floor of a building next to the BMV. You actually need to walk up to a long stairwell with pop art collages, and that leads to the bar/lounge. According to their website, the space was created to be reminiscent of a bar in Hong Kong, and where customers can experience the Asian culture. 

The space felt modern and sleek with its exposed brick, dim lit with a lot of black/red decor, wooden tables and chairs, and black booths. Great for larger groups or even an intimate date for two.

The food and dessert menu has been simplified to feature a small number of items. Unfortunately, we had dinner prior to our visit, so we didn't have room to eat so I can't comment on their food menu. However, Roll Play Bar & Lounge does have a great selection of 88 Asian-inspired cocktails that are named after well-known Asian movies. They have also brought forward a new concept where customers would roll dice to determine what drink they would get, and that's something they're pushing forward. I thought that it was a really interactive, and fun way to add to the atmosphere. 

While we waited for our drinks, we decided to start a game of Jenga. Although, they did away with the board game cafe concept, they kept a few games that weren't too complicated, but still fun to play like Taboo, Jenga, Scrabble, Pictionary, and a few more. The cocktails were well-priced for what you get, and tasted really good.

 For dessert, there was only one option that night, so we ended up getting the burnt marshmallow waffle and ice-cream ($14). The dessert consisted of four waffles topped with burnt marshmallow, drizzled with chocolate sauce, and served with vanilla ice cream and banana slices.  

I have never been here during their early board game phrase, so I can't really comment on how well they transitioned. However, it's a fun place to hang out, drink cocktails, and play games with friends, or even on dates. I thought that the ambiance was nice, and the music wasn't too loud so conversations can easily be made with one another."}
{"text":"Decent game selection. Great reasonably priced food. There was only a short wait for a table too. Good hot and cold drink selection including alcohol. It's a hole in the wall but a gem."}
{"text":"Absolutely disappointed by this place. 

Went with some friends on January 23, 2014 and it appears they've raised the prices again - a slice of cake is a whopping $14, on top of the $5 admission fee to play games. When we arrived at 9pm, we were told the hot drinks bar had already closed and they wouldn't be serving coffee, lattes, hot chocolates etc. (which is what we had intended to order). So, when we told our waiter we didn't want to order anything, he said the fee would then rise to $20 instead of $5 per person. At this point we got up and left - and unless they change their policies, we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Had a great time wasting time here with a few friends :) The food is a hit or miss. Their pizza is made with (very) processed cheddar, to the point that it looks highlighter orange. Their teas are delicious, though! Their game selection leaves a bit to be desired, but other than that, it's a great place to chill."}
{"text":"Perfect place to beat the winter cold with some friends while downtown. I've been multiple times, and each time has been just as enjoyable. It's nicer to go in during odd hours, which allows you to stay for a longer time, otherwise, you have to keep ordering food if you want to sit and play their board games. They have a huge variety of games to choose from, some without instructions though, so you might have to make it up as you play. Desserts and coffee are great, though a little overpriced, but the experience makes it worth paying the extra dollar."}
{"text":"A few things I am VERY impressed with:
- THE FOOD! and the drinks!
- the games are hand-picked!
- staff are very friendly
- LOCATION
- decor!!

I had their Cotton Candy Steamer, which is VERY very sweet (candy-like) flavored coffee. To me it's a bit odd.... but after getting used to the coffee bitter + candy sweet taste, it's actually quite nice. 

ALSO the Hanks Soda (with Vanilla Cream) is reeally really good.

OK ONWARDS: 
The food is FANTASTIC. The chicken is reeally good! Chicken was found in the Nachos ($16) and the Chicken sandwich ($8.50). The sandwiches were served with 3-4 pieces of edamame. 

P.S. soon they will be licensed to serve alcohol :) SOON.

THE GAMES? Currently they have two large shelves (4 narrow shelves) of games, but not FULLY packed like Snakes & Lattes. They're still building their collection... but many are brand new. They will continue to stock the shelves with interesting and unique games, not just ANY game they find.

YES I do love boardgames and such. 

One of the staff was very attentive and taught us how to play Ticket To Ride. (We really wanted to try this game!!)

This cafe is beautifully designed but it's VERY SMALL.  It doesn't look like they'll have enough space to accommodate the Yonge Dundas crowd! For now, since very little people know about it, it was fairly empty at 1:30pm Sunday (became full at around 4pm).

The desserts, coffee, soda, and food items are FANTASTIC! Have I mentioned this yet!???"}
{"text":"Great little place in Toronto if you're looking for a night of fun with friends!
One of the walls is lined with board games that you are invited to play at your table. There is an excellent selection, with some classics alongside some newer board games I hadn't heard of.
The food was great, drinks were good, and the staff was amazingly accommodating. If you're looking for a fun time with some friends, you have to try Roll Play!"}
