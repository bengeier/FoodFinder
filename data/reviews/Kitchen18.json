{"text":"Pretty cool place.  Because I checked in and got 15% off for doing so, I am switching my 4 star to a 5 star.  The food was great and I love places that give yelpers a deal!"}
{"text":"Amazing stuff. Really great burger and classic Mediterranean food. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"What a ripoff, I bought a living social deal for here just to try out a new restaurant. Ordered a grilled salmon wrap for $15, didn't really like it at all, it tasted funny not in a good way, and the wrap was burnt and tasted like it. Whatever, so I get the bill and present my 20 for 10 living social deal, and the manager says they don't take these, haven't for a couple months, well wtf, I just bought it 1 month ago.  So now I paid nearly 20 with tip for a crappy salmon wrap with a very average at best salad.  I would imagine it cost them about 3 dollars to make that meal, and it wasn't good food.  Then, the whole staff gives me the cold shoulder, and I didn't even complain about it.  There were only 3-4 other people in there the whole time from noon to 1 on a Friday. Don't waste your time here"}
{"text":"True Kosher restaurants are few and far between in the Valley of the Sun and so we decided to visit Kitchen 18.  It is a new restaurant started less than a year ago.  It appears that most of the ownership and staff have spent a great deal of their lives in Israel.  Note that the restaurant is closed on Friday evening and Saturday.  Rather busy for a Sunday afternoon and it took a while to get our order in.  The decor is modern and very cool and the presentation of the food was excellent.  We ordered the \"signature falafel\"  and it was flavorful.  The pita that went with it which is made fresh all during the day was fluffy and excellent.  We then ordered the Israeli salad with shawarma and also the shawarma pita sandwich (which came with a side of sweet potato fries or french fries and quinoa or israeli salad).  The shawarma was flavorful and the salad though nothing exotic made for a good combination.  The shawarma sandwich was huge.  The food was plentiful and so we had to pack quite a bit of the salad to take home with us.  The service was very good and the staff was very attentive.  It is wonderful to see family run restaurants serving wonderful home style and wholesome meals.  The menu and food could use some fine tuning but it is a restaurant that I would visit again.  After our meal we visited the store adjacent to the restaurant that sells kosher products."}
{"text":"I really want to like this restaurant because of the location and the food is pretty decent.  I have been in twice now and there is a major language barrier with the person (who always seems to be in training) at the counter.  The trainee seem confused if you vary from the menu at all.  The person that the trainee looks for guidance doesn't seem to speak English and also seems confused.  They seemed anxious to get back to texting on their cell phones. I am surprised at the high marks for this restaurant based on my two experiences ....but hey... third times a charm.  Maybe I'll try again."}
{"text":"Everything is great, there's traditional kosher fare, Felafel and shwarma, Chinese food, sushi....all of it like it's just that kind of restaurant.    The sleeper dish is the fried snapper wrap....the menu description doesn't sound right, but it's amazingly delicious, enough for two to share (depending on your appetite),"}
{"text":"This restaurant was a great find! Everything was fresh, healthy and the taste was amazing!! I will be back the next time I am in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the setting and the surrounding pretty good food. They were way understaffed that day but I understand how it goes in the restaurant business so that wasn't a big deal. So all in all for a kosher restaurant they did pretty well"}
{"text":"So I keep Kosher. Options in the valley are few and far. I think Kitchen18 is up to par with larger cities Kosher options. I am not into the health foods and all and was skeptic when I first went to eat there my first time. However I keep going back! Their service has been great. Their Gluten free Chocolate cake was better than most traditional chocolate cakes I've had. I was very impressed with their appetizers.  I have not tried most items on their menu however their pita is heaven and anything they serve that with is a big hit!  I recommend it to all my friends, kosher and non kosher eaters."}
{"text":"Excellent food, fresh ingredients, local touch and great customer service! Kitchen 18 is my favorite place to go for Vegan Kosher food, and the dishes are consistently great every time I return. Dining room is very tidy and clean, and I would recommend Kitchen 18 to anyone looking for a fairly priced lunch or dinner anytime!"}
{"text":"A lovely Scottsdale restaurant serving the Jewish community of greater Phoenix, is crying out for consistency. Sometimes it's great, others sloppy in prep. & presentation. Too afraid to spice things up a bit...safety in blandness, I suppose. But if you you never take 'taste' risks you never become great. Some worthwhile risks to take: Add a night of great, authentic Mexican selections. Or a Chinese specialty. Focus on consistent quality control & presentation. Brighten up all the soups & salads...don't be afraid to add spice, taste! People will like it! Some things like the burgers or meat in the bolinaise, Hummus on the plate, should be more generous. It's not a good look when things appear skimpy. Charge a bit more if need be in the interest of making food look more inviting & sumptuous. These changes Will pay off in the end. The place has 'good bones'. There is plenty to build on here, so build you may  with wishes for much good success!"}
{"text":"During our visit in Scottsdale visiting my son we ate at kitchen 18 couple of times and everything in menu was fresh and delicious.  Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Comfortable inside and connected to the grocery store next door. First thing we noticed sitting down inside were the dirty cushions up against the wall where you sit. The rest of the place looked cleaner, so sitting on that dirty cushioned area was kind of a surprise and not a good way to start the dinner. Food was OK but nothing spectacular. Friendly service."}
{"text":"I wish they had more vegetarian options (and once mixed up the order) but they have a WONDERFUL falafel pita which has fresh tasting pita bread and includes Israeli salad in it. So whenever I am in the mood for falafel I try to go here. I had to rush out once because I got a call that I had just missed a walk in client so they very quickly changed my order to a take out option. So minus one star for mixing up who had what fries making me and my friend each grab each others sandwich (hers having meat) but otherwise good experiences dining here."}
{"text":"Best shawarma in town hand down. I will be back and bring all my friends and family . That's for the great hospitality ."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance  I got the shawarma and a kabob sandwich to go.  Amazing fries; crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Not greasy at all"}
{"text":"A good little Kosher veggie restaurant in Scottsdale. Not very big portions but filled with wonderful flavor."}
{"text":"The food was quite good and the server was very nice; however, the outside seating on the patio is filthy.  Pigeons living overhead and piles of pigeon poop all over the floor.  Really???  My friend and I were careful to only look at eachother and not even risk a glance sideways at the nasty bird excrement all over the place.  Get rid of the birds and CLEAN THE PLACE!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere in this restaurant is nice!  They offer the only kosher bar that I know of in the city.  The food is excellent and most things are made from scratch.  I asked the waitress about the wait time on chicken  soup, as I had read the review here that said it was a bit long, she said this was because it is made from scratch. They actually cut up the meat, add stock and fresh cut veggies and the perfect amount of spices.  It was truly worth the wait.  The portions are large and the prices really good.  It is a scratch kitchen, which means that everything is made right when you order it.  It is a tough balance to walk between really good, fresh food and trying to please customers who don't have a lot of time.  Kitchen 18 seems to do a good job at both.  You don't have to be Kosher to enjoy this restaurant.  Anyone who likes good meats and fresh, healthy food will love it."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried Kitchen18 for the first time today.  We actually didn't know about this little gem that's been open for over a year.  We eat Kosher so are always looking for a good restaurant to fit our needs, especially for meat dishes.  The food was fabulous.  Being a Sunday, mid-afternoon, it was very quiet.  The atmosphere is more upscale and clean, like a fine-dining restaurant.  Small, quaint.  We ordered hummus for the appetizer.  It was delicious, with a lemony zing to it and the pita bread was out of this world, soft and fluffy...melted in our mouths.  I ordered the turkey and lamb schwarma dish with Israeli salad and rice.  My husband had the pita version of it and fries.  We absolutely loved it.  The meat was tender and well-seasoned.  The Israeli salad was fresh and tasty and the rice moist and flavorful.  His liked his fries, too.  The tahini sauce was yummy.  Our portions were big and very filling.  The service was friendly and quick.  They even honored the Yelp Check In discount of 15% which saved us over $7.00 on our bill.  We definitely look forward to going back to try many different dishes they offer."}
{"text":"I went to Kitchen 18 with my roommate who eats Kosher. We were finally excited to go to a place where we could eat together.  It is close to where we live and the menu seems great!! When we showed up we were sat immediately but it took at least ten minutes to get our drinks and the actual menus. The restaurant was relatively clean but you could tell there was a lack in overall care as there were stains on the bench as well as dust and drink marks on the table.  We were deciding on appetizers when the manager came in and started talking to his workers in a very loud and negative way.  It was very uncomfortable for us. Finally we got our waiter to take our orders off of the very dirty menus.  When the food came it was good but not great. I am not sure that we would come to this place again. It was promising but did not end up being what we hoped it would be. The overall negative aspect was the man interacting with his workers. If it were not for this, we would try this restaurant again."}
{"text":"The restaurant is UNDER NEW MANAGEMENT!!!!! The food is amazing ... many more delicious options like chinese food, sushi to the order and much more.  The new owner and workers are very friendly . The new decor is gorgeous. Great for family events. All in all, huge upgrade in both food and decor"}
{"text":"One of my favorite new restaurants in town with great atmosphere and terrific food.  The talented chef (Nir Cohen) and the staff are welcoming and make you feel right at home. The modern Mediterranean and Israeli menu are fresh, full of authentic flavor and reasonably priced.  Great place for important lunch meeting or a family dinner."}
{"text":"Disappointed. Sliders are all bread. Wings aren't good. Should've tried something more Mediterranean."}
{"text":"Don't believe the hype...this place was hard to find and when we finally did we were not impressed. We were not greeted by any staff upon arrival, service and food were sub-par.  I grew up eating food like this and was looking forward to a good meal, unfortunately that is not what we got!  Aside from that, it was one of the strangest dining experiences we have ever had. We could also see into the kitchen from our seats...not good. Needless to say, we will not be going back."}
{"text":"Ordered food for shabbat and the only thing that was edible was the saled. The chicken was undercooked and looked terrible, Fries were soft.. just a bad experience. Hope they take this opportunity to make drastic improvement..."}
{"text":"So great to have a Kosher restaurant.  Too bad there aren't more Kitchen 18's all over Arizona. We started with sushi as an appetizer and all three rolls we ordered were delicious. By then we were so full we ordered only one entree: the Orange Chicken. Wow what a huge plate. Could have been crispier but the taste was excellent.  I think this restaurant is designed for families where everyone wants something very different for dinner.  They have it all here and based on what we had tonight, it's  all very good."}
{"text":"So thankful to find smashing shawarma and a tidy unique beer selection next to my massage studio at Salon Studios. I lived in Chicago and have tried many many terrific pita sammies. This ranks up there with all the great ones. Service was super friendly. Stop by the specialty store for kosher-food selections and merchandise."}
{"text":"I went here tonight with my family, there were seven of us and we all ordered something different. For reference, we ordered the schnitzel, hot wings, grilled chicken platter, carne asada fries, tortilla soup and schnitzel burger. Each dish was better than the next. The portions were very generous and everything tasted top-notch- they use really quality ingredients. I Live in Los Angeles and of all the kosher restaurants I frequent there, none come close to Kitchen 18 in value and quality."}
{"text":"Had Kitchen 18 cater a physicians' lunch for me. It was DE-LISH.  Nice change from the usual pizza or subs. The wraps were fabulous; especially the veggie wrap! I will definitely use them again. I can't wait to go to the restaurant to sample their entrees!"}
{"text":"I am a regular at Kitchen 18 and the food is consistently good. The menu has a wide variety of dishes and everything is excellent!"}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday dinner with friends.  The server was friendly the place quaint and it quickly became crowded. Not sure what went wrong. There were four of us and our food came out at all different times. The sushi came out first and was good. Then after about 20 more minutes the server came to tell us they ran out of eggs and there was no more eggs to go on top of the burger. The burger arrived shortly after and was cold along with the veggies and mashed potatoes. The salad came out and the chicken on top was not schnitzel it was regular grilled chicken after my friend specifically asked for schnitzel. The salad went back and came out correctly. Then came my Rueben wrap. It was actually done correctly and the fries were delish. When we asked why it all came out separately and about 40 minutes after we ordered we were told that the Chinese food comes faster and that is why other tables received their food first. This however was not true as we noticed a few other tables ordered burgers and wraps well after we were seated and their meals came first.  We then ordered a to go order and were told the kitchen is not taking any to go orders. So we said ok can we have it for here and we will box ourselves. We were told no as it was a special order. All it was, was the wrap sans any vegetables.  Not difficult. Just wrap the schnitzel and no veggies. They also ran out of coke when we ordered another coke.  One last thing. Could you please add a baby changing table to the restrooms so that the dining bench does not become the 2nd best choice."}
{"text":"Maybe an off night. Server seemed too busy to be alone.  Many dirty tables. When we asked for two he looked annoyed not greeting.  Waited a bit but we get busy. He forgot my boyfriends soup.  My Shrawhma was ok. Cous Cous was bland. I liked my boyfriends schnitzel, he thought dry. All and all food did not make up for lack of service.  Doubtful to return."}
{"text":"Very good Kosher restaurant!! I love going there and eat. Even to take out. Prices are reasonable and the food is good :)"}
{"text":"Great food!  Had the Shaumara wrap, apple cinnamon cake. Hubbie had grilled chicken. Easy to meet dietary needs with the menu."}
{"text":"Always enjoy this little gem in Scottsdale! Small, quaint venue that serves delicious kosher fare! Picked up their signature shawarma pitas with sides of french fries. Manager Elon is personable and very accommodating! Must make a habit of dining at Kitchen 18!!!!"}
{"text":"We order from her usually take out.  Lovely kosher place. Always delicious. Wish we could afford to get more often.  It is also kinda far away for us. I have only ever spoken to employees on the phone when placing an order, but they are always nice. I always look forward to trying something new off the menu."}
{"text":"Wow !  The new (one year or some) ownership change so much.  The place is awesome, the food is very good. And it's Kosher place, that makes it even better.! Thank you, this place very recommended !"}
{"text":"Being from out of town I like to try different kinds of food . I haven't had a schnitzel in quite a few years. I had the chicken schnitzel with sweet potato fries and grilled veggies. The schnitzel needed some kind of gravy because it was very dry. Fortunately my wife had the Falafel Plate which had a lot of hummus which I used to coat my schnitzel. The grilled veggies were over cooked. They tasted like my mother made them.Par boiled and soggy then grilled.  I think it's a Jewish thing. We will give you a ton of food that is bland and over cooked. Hoping that you ate so much food for your money that you will be satisfied. Didn't work for me."}
{"text":"Best Shawarma in Town. i love this Kosher place. the food is good and the people are nice!!! i will definitely go there more times :) thanks again guys for the great food and time there!!"}
{"text":"We had an excellent lunch today. They offered us a 15% discount because we used Yelp!  The food was amazing. It was a blast. The service was friendly. They were fairly quick about bringing the food. It is a great spot in town to get fresh food."}
{"text":"Being from NY I grew acustom to getting good mediterian food, but since i have lived out here Ive been forced to the commercial places like Pita Jungle. This place blows them all away! I feel like im home again!"}
{"text":"By chance I managed to show up here at an off hour and I was the only customer. I got to talk to waiter. The chef is from Israel. They use all natural organic ingredients and everything's made from scratch. It shows!  The food was amazballs! I'm telling you, if you're in the Scottsdale area hit this place up. Plus if you check-in on Yelp you get 15% off.   Side note: I asked what's up with the name. The number 18 is lucky in Judaism."}
{"text":"First time coming here after the new owner took over, and I can easily say that it exceeded my expectations by a lot!! The food was very delicious and the portion sizes are huge! I highly recommend getting the hummus app. and the peppered steak! Overall, great food and atmosphere"}
{"text":"Really wanted to love this place and had high hopes based on the reviews, but was disappointed. My Mom and I ordered the chicken and veggie soup, which was really good as our appetizers. For lunch we had the shawarma and the grilled chicken with a side of steamed veggies. Both the chicken and the meat were extremely dry. The flavor was good, but just way too dry. Unfortunately, we won't be back."}
{"text":"I like this place.  It sits in a plaza right by where I work out, and so on one of the many nights where I don't cook dinner, I decided to stop in.  I think it was around 5 or 6 on a weeknight. I ordered the quinoa salad, side shwarma, and the chicken and vegetable soup.  The chicken and vegetable soup is sooo good! There is a wide variety of veggies, I think squash and zucchini and carrots and it really tastes so homemade. I could eat that soup everyday.  The quinoa salad was fresh and perfect.  It had cucumbers and just enough dressing in it (olive oil) to make sure it wasn't dry. Much better than any of the ones at Whole Foods.  The shwarma side portion was a lot of meat, more than I anticipated.  It was very good also. I took the quinoa salad and shwarma home, there was enough of it, but it was so tasty that it didn't really last that long after :)  The food was great, the prices are extremely reasonable, but they needed a second server on the day I visited.  I sat at the little bar at the front and it just seemed a little chaotic.  The server was quick and good, but there were more people than she could handle, not her fault.  She was super sweet.   I wouldnt call this place fine dining, its definitely a great little meal spot to stay and enjoy your dinner or lunch.  Use your yelp check in and save 15% too!"}
{"text":"Great family-casual restaurant in the Valley.    I was in town for Thanksgiving with the family and we ate there.  I had the burger with poblano peppers and my dad had the pastrami burger.  Both were tasty and had big portions.  I would recommend the sweat potato fries over the steak fries."}
{"text":"This is hidden back behind the DQ off of Scottsdale at Shea - went in for lunch. The server was very friendly and welcoming.  I ordered the chicken and lamb shawarma (pita) with fries. It was quite tasty (and, you won't leave hungry - I just had my leftover portion for lunch today!) Seemed like most everyone else who came in were regulars (they recognized each other). Cool little place - give it a shot!"}
{"text":"Great kosher spot in Scottsdale!  Delicious burgers, nice ambiance, and very friendly staff.  Will definitely recommend to friends when they visit the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"My first visit and I will be back. Good food, a touch expensive, but you get what you pay for.  On the other hand, the price of burgers are over the top!  The meals are much more filling than the pita sandwiches and not that much more. So, buy the meal!   They have fresh loaves of bread on Friday!"}
{"text":"Food was great! We really enjoyed the Israeli salad, ingredients were fresh and tasty. The pita bread was soft and fluffier than traditional pita bread, so good. I enjoyed the lamb and my wife enjoyed the grilled chicken. Only complaint was the service was slow, we waited a bit for the check. Will return."}
{"text":"Ordered take out and was delicious.  The portions were more than generous.  We had a Salad18 with grilled chicken and the Schwarma Wrap.  Both were great!"}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the reasonable prices and small size of this restaurant. The portions are quite generous and the food is excellent. The chicken soup had chunks of real chicken, the sort of chicken I remember fondly as a child. The grass fed beef sliders were exceptional, with beef that was lean and tasted like beef. The pita was the best I have ever had. The Turkey Beef schwarma was very good, flavorful and moist. The hummus and the Israeli salad were very good. This is a small place with friendly service and an informal feel. Expand the menu a little and expand the room so the kitchen wasn't visible and it would get a five."}
{"text":"We have been going to this restaurant for a couple years now and it was always OK but since it has been under new management, it has become amazing. The chef Jaime always uses fresh ingredients and makes sure each dish is the way you like it. The staff are all very friendly and eager to please. We really love coming here and are grateful to have such a high quality kosher restaurant so close to home! Thanks for the great food and keep doing what your doing!!"}
{"text":"New management (Again) remodeled (again) and a new menu, makes for some new food adventures.  I hope this is the last time things change here as they seem to have gotten everything right. It feels like nice sit down dinning establishment with space for larger groups. There is an eclectic menu that has middle eastern food, sushi, sandwiches, burgers, Chinese, vegetarian and vegan food and more.It is all kosher FYI.  My wife had an amazing portabello paninni, while it was not a true paninni, it did not matter as the pesto dressing and generous amounts of mushrooms made it great, as were the crisp sweet potato fries.  I tried the special, osso buco, it was the first time I ever had this dish, so I can't compare to else where but it was quite good, full of flavor and came with some fresh gnocci. Tip ask for the \"spicy\" it is s'cug and its is made in house and it is great.  Now that I have kids my one request would be a changing table in the restroom."}
{"text":"NEW MANAGEMENT * NEW MENU* DECOR IMPROVEMENT* MUCH BETTER FOOD! Potential for 5 stars (should have renamed restaurant to match the new identity)  The only thing the same about Kitchen 18 is the address and that it is still a kosher restaurant that serves fully inspected meats unlike randomly inspected non-kosher meat. Only disease free animals are used. Grass Fed beef comes from the front quarter of the cow and the back end is sold to non-kosher plants. For these reasons meat platters do cost more than from non-kosher places.   The menu offers a lot of variety but includes Middle Eastern Mediterranean Foods, SUSHI, Chinese style food, American Food and International Specials.  We shared a variety of plates and started with Spicy Tuna Sushi. The tuna was clean tasting but not spicy. The rice was rolled nicely and didn't fall apart. Light soy, wasabi paste, a creamy sweet and slightly spicy sauce, a sweet kind of teriyaki and pickled ginger were served with the sushi.   The Mediterranean Platter had very above average Falafels that were made with fresh herbs. The Falafels are what I'd call the crunchy meatball style that most but not all restaurants serve. The Baba Ganoush was AMAZING. Fire Charred Eggplant with just the right spices and textures. I haven't come across any better in Phoenix or Glendale. Hummus creamy and above average and also above average fluffy fresh pita bread.  Shawarma Plate was also OUTSTANDING. The Chicken Meat had that really super perfect juicy texture and Flavor. So moist and seasoned just so. It might have been the BEST Chicken Shawarma I ever had. Blows away the shawarma I tried from other Mediterranean Restaurants I've been to lately. Skhug sauce (red pepper hot sauce)  was a different style that I am used too. It was very hot and tasty and made with dried spicy peppers. The Grilled Vegetables that came on the plate were very delicious. Pita bread was very above average and was light and fluffy and fresh made.  I note since this is a kosher restaurant I wouldn't expect the Chinese Food or even the sushi to be the best. Haven't sampled enough of the menu to award 5 stars but they do serve some winners here and the Mediterranean Food was above average for sure!  Very much worth a try for the Shawarma and Baba Ganoush"}
{"text":"The food is so good! Owner is super friendly ! I am from California,came for a trip and I had dinner  The steak was the best I ever had  Highly recommend"}
{"text":"It's really Zero stars, (Yelp won't let me post without at least 1 star)under new management\" did not honor 15% Yelp check-in discount. Now owned by the La Bella kosher dairy restaurant. That's no excuse, they are certainly able to honor that. We walked out- loss of $30-$40 bill. Guess business is THAT good, not. We were the only ones in there."}
{"text":"Always fast friendly service, vast menu choices and great value. Mitchell is great and always remembers your name. Hard to say what I like best, Salad, Wraps, Tuna salad and probably the best Fries in Scottsdale! Go!"}
{"text":"I didn't really know much about this place, but all of our choices for Mother's Day lunch were completely booked! Was looking for somewhere different and not as busy to try out, so I decided on Kitchen 18! We made a reservation on yelp, not realizing it was a hole in the wall type place ha. But we were impressed! We weren't sure about it when we first walked up, but we left happy for sure. The lady working there was nice, as we were eating some people showed up who were clearly regulars, which was cool. I like it when little restaurants are like that. As a vegetarian, I was very excited about the menu. Settled on the \"18 Bits\" appetizer platter as my meal so I could try a bit of everything! The rest of my family all got chicken pitas with the bread on the side. Also my sister and mom got sweet potato fries on the side and they were so dang good. My platter had baba ganoosh, hummus, falafel, and a quinoa salad. The quinoa and the hummus were my favorite part! So good. The pita bread was warm and soft too, amazing. The baba ganoosh was good but not my favorite, and the falafel was a bit too crispy for my liking, but it was good with the tahini! Checked in on here and got 15% off so that was sweet. Overall, pleased with Kitchen 18, will be recommending it to our Jewish fam friends for sure."}
{"text":"Only a few things hold it back from 5 stars: they always seem to be a little shortstaffed (they really need one more server there), menu needs some variety or rotation, the new colors completely take away the date night charm, and the Chinese food needs a lot of improvement. Aside for that the food is excellent and always exactly what I order. The staff are amazing. Ask for the bbq sauce."}
{"text":"A small restaurant in the southern part of Scottsdale & Shea. Style kitchen is kosher meat / Israeli food. It has a new style. Atmosphere of expensive price of $ - $$. There is a new manager, Alon. Nice young man from Israel who loves food ... If you want to have lunch or dinner. The place serves vegetarian food / meat kosher place close to the center Chabad. Very pleasant atmosphere and delicious food returns you back to Israel's tastes. The kitchen does not use canned and frozen food - so that all the food will be kosher They prepare all the dishes from scratch and the taste is felt. In addition, they now have another promotion of 15%. Highly recommend. And do not give up on Turkish coffee at the end of the meal  -  - - - /"}
{"text":"This visit was due to several recommendations from acquaintances, who said they've enjoyed their meals here many times.  It was a spontaneous stop tonight. I ordered a bowl of chicken tortilla soup. It was very flavorful and contained veggies and plenty of chicken. It was hearty and filling and I'd get it again for sure. I also bought a side of pita bread which was spongy and tasty.  I'll be back for more food."}
{"text":"They've only been open a few weeks, but Kitchen 18 is already doing a fabulous job with their (kosher) food, service, and ambiance.    I went to meet some girlfriends for dinner the other night, and we all were delighted to see that the place was jammed.  Lucky for us, there was one table open when we arrived, and it seemed to have our name on it!  The hostess was friendly as was our server, and we were impressed by the wide selection on the menu.  None of us keep kosher, but we were intrigued that there were plenty of fresh and healthy options.    We started with the hummus appetizer to share and we also tried the salami and fig bruschetta.  The hummus was a tad on the bland side, but I loved that they served it with warm fluffy pita (white and wheat) and delicious pickles and peppers too.  The bruschetta was tasty... I can't compare it to Postino (my fave place for bruschetta) as you can't possibly compare kosher salami bruschetta to something quite the opposite, but it was good.  For our entrees, I had the Israeli salad with schwarma and really enjoyed it.  It was a large portion, so I boxed half of it to take home, but it was colorful, filling, and seasoned just right. One of my friends had the sliders and the other went with steak, which they both enjoyed.  Oh, and I ate more than a few of the sweet potato fries that came with the steak - they were delicious!  We shared a tiramisu dessert which didn't disappoint, even being dairy free!  (The kitchen happens to be entirely dairy free, so don't ask for a cheese burger when you go!)  I love that the attached market stays open late, so I did a little bit of shopping after our meal.  I highly recommend a product they carry called \"popcorners.\"  They are popped corn chips and totally addicting!  There are tons of other unique kosher food items at the market too and an entire jewish gift shop as well (which I believe is in the process of being remodeled).  I look forward to returning to Kitchen 18 again soon... It's moderately priced and conveniently located on the Southeast corner of Scottsdale and Shea.  Whether you're keeping kosher, trying to eat healthy, or none of the above, there is something for everyone on the menu."}
{"text":"Great food, great service and very fair prices. The portions are really big.   Note that at the time of this review yelp shows the restaurant one until 8:00, but when I called they said they close at 9:00."}
{"text":"We came in on a Friday around noon, and were only 1 of 3 tables in the entire place.  The food was pretty good; I had a grilled chicken breast and a garden salad and sauteed veggies as sides.  Hubby had the Schnitzel which was tasty and huge.  4 stars for food, but service lacked.  It took a long time to get our food, and refills on tea/water.  Then we redeemed a deal we'd bought online and were told we had to \"buy more\" to use the entire amt. of the deal! We've never experienced that before, if anything it's a benefit to the restaurant who doesn't have to give us \"more\" since we were willing to forfeit it!  But she said that was the case, so we agreed to a piece of cake to go...the bill went from $27 to $36 (with tax).  The dry piece of thick-as-cement chocolate cake we brought home was inedible and NOWHERE worth the $7 or $8 price tag it came with!  We'd never go back. Too many good restaurants in S'dale to come here...and the bathroom was FILTHY.  Fluorescent light kept flickering in there so I was in the dark 1/2 the time and trash all over the floor. Gross."}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants in Scottsdale. Lots of variety and outstanding quality. Well worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Nice fresh salads and wonderful soups! Great Israeli pickles and hummus. Highly recommend trying."}
{"text":"Best shwarma, schnitzel, and falafel ! Don't fall for the \"pita jungle\" imitations...this place has zest and love mixed into every bite of their handmade hummus, techina and babaganoush....if you hAvnt tried this place you are truly missing out!"}
{"text":"This place is close to where we live. We recently moved here and were unaware of the large Jewish presence in the area. We came in one evening and my wife and I were literally the only non-Jews in the restaurant. A little girl came in and pointed and said \"Daddy, why doesn't he have on his hat?!\" This is just one comment I heard. There were mumblings of the \"goy\" sitting in the restaurant. We were being stared down by many of the patrons. On the upside, the staff were friendly, at least our waitress was, as she was the only staff member we interacted with. The food was okay. Nothing spectacular but everything was fine, nothing tasted bad and the portions were decent. I don't think we'll be coming back though as this doesn't seem to be a friendly atmosphere for Catholics or other non-Jews."}
{"text":"With the New management this place has become now of the premier kosher restaurants in the Phoenix Area. The food was delicious, I got a Salmon Chipotle Wrap and it was out of this world. Will definitely be coming back here!"}
{"text":"The food is great, the new ownership really made a change! The service is great, we had a great time and we enjoyed eating there. Great kosher place and great for that like good food. If you in scottsdale I would recommend you to go there."}
{"text":"Wonderful restaurant & great catering!   They do an excellent job & the owner is honest and a mensch. The rest of the staff does a very nice job too.   Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The food was tasty, but nothing I'd run back for. I got the kefta kabobs. They were pretty salty and a little dry."}
{"text":"The food was very good and nicely plated. Not the fanciest of food, but it properly cooked to our requests.   Will return in the future."}
{"text":"Love Kitchen 18!  If you keep Kosher, you will find the meat is as good as any kosher place in NYC or Miami!  The menu is deep having many choices for vegans as well.  I happen to LOVE mexican food and the main chef, Jaime, serves the absolute best tortilla soup ever and anything else you might request that isn't on the menu.  If you are in the mood for sushi and the person you are eating with isn't...this is a fantastic option - as they have it all!  If you want delicious food, you must try Kitchen 18!"}
{"text":"Nice having a kosher restaurant so close to home. Surprisingly busy for a Monday night. I only had the hummus platter so I have to come back for the Shnitzle"}
{"text":"Great food, awesome service (thank you Chase) and very reasonable pricing.  Next time I'm in the area I will definitely be stopping by again!"}
{"text":"big portion.  can't go wrong for Mediterranean food, its not stellar but satisfying."}
{"text":"My first time eating at this restaurant, or and kosher type place. I ordered the shawarma with fries and grilled veggies. Not only was the food delicious, but I liked the fact that the grilled veggies weren't like every other restaurant around!  It had squash, zucchini, bell peppers, fantastic. I'm also a hefty eater, and I couldn't even eat it all. I ended up taking half of it home. For me, the prices where justified considering I was able to make two meals out of one. Very tasty. Will return when I'm in the area again!"}
{"text":"This isn't a place that I would typically eat at, but I was with a friend who keeps kosher, so we gave it a shot.  The place is somewhat small, but not crowded and is clean and well maintained.  The service wasn't the greatest but there was only one server and a few tables came at the same time, so I was understanding.  The menu has a decent selection of kosher fare, from burgers, chicken, steak, etc.  I ordered the Kabob which was not what I expected.  It was basically a hamburger on a stick, but the meat was seasoned and cooked perfectly and was quite tasty.  The french fries were excellent!  The person I was with ordered the steak and it was tender and tasted pretty good, not sure if it was worth $27 though.  You could probably get the same quality steak at Denny's, but it wouldn't be kosher of course.  All in all, I would come back here if I was with someone who keeps kosher, but won't be back on my own."}
{"text":"Expanded seating area, good Revised menu, even better Sushi, almost excellent  Unfortunately same disorganized and lousy service"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here tonight and our experience was wonderful. We knew we would be arriving late so we called them and they were so accommodating and told us it would be fine. Their last seating is officially 8:15 & we got there 8:20. The ambiance is beautiful, classy and clean. Not super upscale but definitely nicer than average. Amanda was very helpful on the phone with directions and greeted us when we came in. Rick was our waiter and a native of Scottsdale. He was very friendly and told us some useful information about the area. BUT THE FOOD. O.M.G. I am sooo glad we went here. Alex, a young chef of 19, is unbelievable. Her meat is just so perfect and tender and all was super tasty. I had the Yemenite soup and burger 18 with vegetables instead of fries. The soup was out of this world and VERY generously sized bowl. THE BURGER. I have never had a burger without ketchup until tonight. I like my meat well done but juicy...a hard combination to master but Alex nailed it. Yum!!!  The ceaser salad that comes with the burger is small and wasn't that good. The steamed vegetables were very good. My husband had grilled vegetables as an appetizer. They were delicious but the portion size was small. He had schwarma and Israeli salad for his main and said both were good. it comes with pita and he said that was great. I personally am not big on schwarma, but he seemed to enjoy his meal very much.  The chef hung out with us after we finished eating and told us some tips. She was super nice, humble, and friendly. Thanks for such a wonderful experience. :)"}
{"text":"Stopped in here today for a late lunch.  It is a small place only about 7 tables and about half of the tables were taken.  We ordered the soup which comes in a big bowl and the carrot bisque with the sage is very very tasty.  I would recommend.  I wish they served the soup with crackers or something.  But if you ask for some bread which the make themselves they will bring some pipping out challah bread for you to eat and it was very good, of course they have no butter because they do not serve anything with dairy... The bowtie bolgnese pasta is very good and even though the menu says spicy suace - it was not spicy for any of us and we hate spicy dishes.  Also we sent the veggie pita back, was not to appetizing and enjoyed the chicken salad sandwich with the sides of salad and sweet potato fries.  I ordered the quinoa salad which was just alright nothing to write home about.  They do get crowded on Sunday evenings and they bathrooms need some upkeeping.  Both Rick and Amanda were very pleasant.  We will be going back again to try the grass fed beef burgers and some other stuff.  for the 3 of each we all ordered soup, hot tea and entrees the total with tax was just under $60....They just celebrated they one year anniversary,,,,It is a very small place inside but definitely worth a try especially if you like wholesome organic home made food with a twist."}
{"text":"Kitchen 18 did the catering for my granddaughters bat mitzvah. Everything was wonderful. The food was delicious, the deserts were exceptional, and we were very pleased with the whole thing. Nathan did an amazing job!"}
{"text":"Kitchen 18 has evolved significantly since my previous review.  It remains a cheerful, comfortable, clean place to relax and eat a meal.  The service time has improved and the staff is friendly but not intrusive.  The big change is the food.  At my last two visits, every item on my plates was very well prepared and properly seasoned, from the schnitzel to the baba ghanouj (especially good) to the vegetables, bean soup, Israeli salad, ... you name it.  Don't expect gourmet, but expect your meal to be just what you thought it should be.  Oh, yes, prices are still low, especially for kosher."}
{"text":"We went there for the first time since I got a groupon. Our family thoroughly enjoyed the food - fresh & flavorful! Also, very reasonable prices! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Nice decor  Foods top grade kosher and tasty! Service staff always nice and cheerful The cinnamon dessert cake with a side of ice cream was verrrry good I like the simplicity of the menu and they spice that up with daily specials!"}
{"text":"Really surprised by how much I enjoyed Kitchen 18. I am Jewish, but usually am not a fan of Kosher restaurants. Excellent cuts of meat here and I am a big fan of their hummus. I have even tried their gluten free chocolate cake and loved it.  I have been here 3-4 times and only once did not come away impressed by the wait time and the staff. I'd definitely recommend Kitchen 18 to someone who doesn't want to spend a lot of money and enjoys quality food."}
{"text":"Love the food here. Such a fabulous variety and the portions are huge so bring your appetite. Classic Jewish foods, Chinese, Sushi, burgers, etc. and all Kosher. But you don't have to be Jewish to love the food."}
{"text":"Good Jewish food ! Love the Israeli salad and the kabob was yum too .. Staff is friendly and the ambience is great ."}
{"text":"My family and I went to Kitchen 18 this week on a Tuesday afternoon for lunch. We were taking our kids to Taliesin West to visit and we needed a place for lunch that was vegetarian friendly as I am a veg and my wife is mostly veg. Our kids are 100% still carnivores so we needed a place to satisfy all needs. I searched for a vegetarian restaurant near where we were and Kitchen 18 came up!  I decided to try it and it was definitely worth the short ride to Scottsdale/Shea. We are not Jewish and do not follow Kosher laws. We are faithful Christians that try to eat higher quality and organic  foods as much as possible. I have not eaten at a Kosher restaurant since moving to AZ 8 years ago from New Jersey. I have always appreciated the quality and higher standards of Kosher food, so I knew this place would be good. Boy, I was 100% right in that assumption. The food was excellent and the service was superb!  We started with the hummus/babaganoush plate to share and it was excellent. The baba was the best I have ever had and it was so happy that it did not contain yogurt as so many of them do. Being Kosher, the dairy is not allowed to be served in the same restaurant or even prepared in the same kitchen. I do not consume animal products at all, so this was awesome! The pita wedges were homemade, fluffy and delicious! The hummus was mild tasting but creamy and wonderful. Plus it came with black olives and Israeli pickles.  For the meal, my wife ordered the carrot soup and the grilled veggies platter. I did not try the soup but she said it was very fresh and delicious. The grilled veggies were seasoned nicely, smoky and satisfying. I had the veggie pita sandwich that came with a mound of sweet potato fries and a side of rice (basmati) with grilled mushrooms. The sandwich was made with the same homemade pita and it was fantastic! The rice was cooked well but needed a little more salt, but otherwise was great. The kids had the Kitchen 18 burger which was a grass-fed beef patty on a wonderful Challah roll served with a mound of french fries. My son was a little upset that he could not order bacon and cheese on his burger, but I think he survived just fine. ;). The burger looked well made and was cooked perfectly to order. The fries looked fresh cut and were cooked well.  The staff was friendly and attentive to our needs without being overbearing. Our drinks were brought out quickly and the timing of the meal was perfect. Granted it was a slow Tuesday afternoon, but I am sure the service is good all the time.  We did not have room for dessert but wanted to try the carrot cake or the chocolate cake. Maybe another time! We do not get over to Scottsdale that often as we live on the west side of town but will 100% consider Kitchen 18 again. Back on the east coast (and before I was vegan) I ate at quite a few Kosher restaurants and delis in my past and Kitchen 18 is as good or better than any of them. I look forward to going back and trying the falafel wrap and having more of the delicious pita and hummus. Shalom. L'hitraot. Toda."}
{"text":"The new management is great. Their food is absolutely amazing, everything tastes super delicious and is always fresh. Their staff is always making sure customers are satisfied! Very friendly atmosphere, always worth spending lunch and dinner at this place!! Thumbs up and good luck!"}
{"text":"Amazing food.  Great service.  Love the beef kabob and the shwarma.  Can't wait to eat here again."}
{"text":"Their food is delicious! Service was good too. Definitely all homemade. I would absolutely go there again."}
{"text":"We had just gotten off of the plane and called to inquire about a wait or reservations. The gentleman that answered the phone was helpful. We hung up. I called back to inquire about ordering ahead because we were going straight to a family event. The same gentleman was very helpful and patient.   Our food was correct AND amazing!!! We are coming from Memphis where there aren't many options but the grass fed burger was amazing! Service was good! And the meal came with a choice of salads and a side. My husband had the regular fries that were great and a large portion with a Caesar salad and I had veggies and a quinoa salad.   We ordered Shabbas dinner for the next night as well! We can't wait to go back! Great experience and food!!!"}
{"text":"Holy Kosher cow, what fantastic food. Extensive Kosher (I'm not Kosher) menu of everything from sushi, Mediterranean, Chinese (seriously), seafood/ you name it. Super fresh and very plentiful. Tonight they a pleasant musician to set the mood. Kind of an out of the way place, hidden gem in a plain setting. If you want something different and delicious this is it. We went because we were at an event they catered and it was beyond belief good."}
{"text":"Really good fresh food, big portions, very nice and clean place, for those who kosher the best place in town, big variety from middle eastern, Japanese, Chinese and of course American food."}
{"text":"All the food looked great. We had delicious juicy hamburgers. If we were in Scottsdale more often we would be regulars.  Sweet potato fries excellent.  The people were friendly."}
{"text":"My friend wanted to go to a Vegetarian restaurant since she doesn't eat meat. I really wanted to try this place since it got almost 5 stars.   First off, I am definitely NOT a vegetarian. I need my meat in my life! lol. But I'm always open to trying new things. =) We ordered the hummus to start which I thought was quite tasty. It was actually a pretty big portion. Most places I go to I always run out of Pita bread. lol. I then ordered the Bowtie Bolognese. I thought it was ok. It wasn't the best thing I've ever had or the worse. I thought it was a bit bland and maybe could've used some vegetables with it.   I liked the fact that they have vegan dishes AND entrees with meat in it as well. The best part? I got 15% off of my order thanks to Yelp! Woo Hoo! lol.   It's a very cute, cozy restaurant and I liked the environment. Not to mention the customer service was very friendly. They close at 9 though so you'll have to go early.   It's quite far for me as well so I probably wouldn't come back unless my Vegetarian friend really wanted to. =)"}
{"text":"I liked this place a lot! Nice, modern décor and very clean. It does detract from the ambiance that part of the kitchen is at the front of the eating area. There was a waiter drying silverware at the counter while we were eating.   The food was great. We ordered the hummus platter, the shwarma entrée, and the Kitchen18 burger. The hummus and fresh pita were delicious. The shwarma and burger were very good too, and the sweet potato fries were out of this world. I'd be back!"}
{"text":"Terrible experience  Went to Kitchen 18 on Christmas Day and it was very crowded. Waitress waits on people who came in after us. ???  Brought water to the tables around us and left our water  on an empty table, so we got it ourselves.  People who came in after us got their food rather quickly and we are still sitting there. Finally get  our orders taken and after  80 (eighty) minutes, still no food.  Meanwhile the other tables are finishing up.  Our waitress  diligently visiting the other tables, but never comes back to us.  Finally we speak to the manager, Michael who says the other tables came in before us  Not true. after another ten minutes we try to speak to the manager again and  after an hour and fifteen minutes we get our food.... three hamburgers and Mongolian Beef.  Hamburgers are great.  Mongolian beef is  not hot and the beef is  gristle  and dry and chewy.    Still no waitress to be seen.  Not bad enuf?  I visit the ladies room and the floor and toilet seat are littered with toilet paper, lots of it.  No paper to dry my hands.   Flush the toilet and the tank leaks all over the floor.  Yuck!  When she brought the tab, I asked the waitress what  was the trouble, and she did not answer me.  I know this place gets good reviews, so I guess ours was a \"fluke.\"  Everyone around us was telling the waitresses  that their food was delicious.  By the way, we were a party of four well dressed adults and I have eaten there quite a few times for lunch."}
{"text":"My wife and I recently went to check out Kitchen 18 as they are close to the house and we wanted to try a new Mediterranean restaurant. This one stood out as different being kosher with an Israeli flare. The schnitzel was like grandma's so as you know, could use a little more salt. I would have given a 5 star but the when asked for a glass of wine they let me know they accidentally let their wine and beer license expire and they would be getting it back soon. I'll check back before I return,"}
{"text":"It was busy and noisy - lots of families there.  You order your food and then they bring to you.  Not my style.  I enjoy service and atmosphere busy and fast pac.  Good food but hard to visit!  Service was fast."}
{"text":"Orange chicken good but the orange sauce wasn't really too moist. The service is great and my tables waiter did a really good job keeping up with all 10-12 of us. Don't be afraid to send back a burger if they cooked it in a way other than asked for. Fried rice is really good BTW. Chinese food is expensive though but that's to be expected for kosher food and minimum wage raise. At night is always a cool place to hang out, always filled. I don't know about during the day though.... Anyways pretty good experience (s) overall .... Been here before and I can give almost all of those times 4 and 5stars. Service:great food: really good kosher food price: a little pricey, but worth it. My dish was  orange chicken with fried rice (which was an extra $2. Have fun!!"}
{"text":"The food is always fresh and delicious. They have a really yummy California roll and their Avacado salad can feed two. Love coming here when I am in the area."}
{"text":"My wife and I were in Phoenix and was looking for a kosher meat restaurant. Unfortunately there is only one in town and this was it. Typically when there's only one of anything your expectations are usually low because they know they're going to get your business without even trying.   I'm not gonna say I was floored but I'm also not gonna say I was disappointed. The decor has a lot to be desired but what we went there for was for the food. For the only game in town the food was much better than I thought it was going to be and that is why am leaving the five stars.   Will you rave about this place? Maybe, maybe not but what I am sure of is you will be leaving satisfied with the quality of the food"}
