{"text":"We went to Shabu Fondu with a group and we had a great experience! The staff was friendly, accomodating, and helpful. The food was great and it was fun to cook it yourself. The menu is rather extensive and it would be easy to eat vegetarian here. They served there water with some cucumber and that was also tasty. The wife and I had the Curry and Shabu Beef, Broccoli, Bok Choy and Rice Noodles. It was a winning combo!"}
{"text":"I entered Shabu Fondue this evening anticipating a fun and filling meal. While fondue is always fun, I found this particular meal was lacking in the filling department. My husband and I ordered the cheese course for two (swiss and emmenthal cheeses with white wine and lemon), which was really delicious with apple slices and bread chunks. We followed up with steak and chicken (served with a selection of vegs and a hot, seasoned chicken broth). In retrospect, we should have given this course a miss and ordered more of the cheese! 

The cheese course cost us $13.00 for two (portion size was very small), while the ribeye cost $15.95 and the chicken $14.95 (all prices exclusive of taxes). We both definitely felt that we would have been better off eating at The Melting Pot because, while it is more expensive, it offers better value -- bigger portions, a larger selection of meats and seafood, more choices in regards to cooking methods (oils and different kinds of broths), and fixed price menus for groups with 2+ people. 

The atmosphere at Shabu was also lacking. A restaurant's quality can often be measured by how many covers it has in an evening. On the day after Christmas Day a restaurant should be buzzing. Shabu was nearly empty.

I will say that our server was quite excellent, though. She was attentive and a great conversationalist. If the food we had consumed had been to the same standard, I would definitely have rated this restaurant with 5 stars."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. They are very helpful to hotpot newbies. We tried the peppercorn broth which was amazing."}
{"text":"Shabu Fondue only opened a few nights ago, and they are already off to a great start! We were so impressed with the variety of the menu and ended up ordering two different broths, both of which were spicy and delicious. We ordered a ton of ingredients, but the pork dumplings and grass-fed beef were by far favorites at our table. We were lucky enough to have chef/owner Johnny Chu stop by our table probably three times just to chat and see what we liked and what we didn't. A great experience overall!"}
{"text":"What a great addition to Phoenix! After eating at a similar hot pot restaurant in L.A., I was so excited to find one here. Shabu Fondue was amazing from start to finish. A great martini at the bar followed by the most high quality, delicious food, and great service too. The perfect date night and now one of our favorite restaurants!"}
{"text":"Yum A Rootie!!  This place is GOOD!!  The broth choices are many.  We had the miso and the lemongrass.  The meat is very fresh and the veggies plentiful.   We will go back again very soon!!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed the food so much here that we decided to give it another try, this time on a week night. The music was still annoying, but the volume was waaay lower than it was on our previous visit.  We're hoping that our first visit was just a fluke, and based on this last experience, we are definitely going there again."}
{"text":"Wow, well done.   Service, food was amazing, I'm coming back for sure.  The atmosphere is beautiful with trendy art work.   You will leave happy and full.  And guarantee you'll be back.   I've eaten at Shabu Fondue restaurants all over and I have to say this is one of the best"}
{"text":"I have zero pictures of the food... why because I basically inhale it when it gets to the table. I have one main recommendation, try the \"spicy\" lemongrass broth it's the way to go and save what's left over and have it in a mug in the morning instead of coffee. (You're welcome)... I only have one complaint, start me off with more of the two sauces you all provide, filling up that little cup half way isn't doing any one any favors. They have very attentive service which is a huge plus and also... I mean, it's HOT POT! Yum!"}
{"text":"It was a great experience. Everything is Al a Cart. The prices are very fair and the vegetable quality was good. I would definitely go back to this place."}
{"text":"What fun! Food is really good. Veggies are fresh.  Service is good.  My one complaint is that the staff are constantly walking around turning the pot temperature up and down.  Pretty annoying."}
{"text":"My wife and I had passed this restaurant a week prior to visiting & decided to have a date night. We got a babysitter & drove all the way from Baseline Rd because we were going to see a show not too far from Shabu & thought this would be a fun place to eat.


The saying that first impressions can set the mood... well maybe this restaurant should consider having a more polite, contentious , & courteous staff to greet & serve the customers , And our experience could have been a better one.

Apon arrival we were greeted by one of the rudest young ladies i have ever come across. We said hello and asked how long the wait was. No answer. She was looking down, we said, Hi, how long for two people? She answered, \"hold on\" without looking up. We could see the light from her phone on her face. 

A few minutes go by & we walk up to the podium to let HER know there are open tables, and we have a show to get to soon, she says \" i was gonna come get you in a second ..\" And when my wife and i both when seated, we agreed we both heard her mumble something under her breath.


The worst part of our time here was, the experience with our waitress. She looked over at us after we sat down. She was just standing around & didn't seem to be doing anything , and then continued to avoid us for about 10 minutes. She seemed so inexperienced with talking to people. She was kind of pushy, and very impolite and uninformative when we asked about the menu. She was stuttering, and made us feel very uncomfortable, to be honest. The worst part was she smelled like all types of smoke, and it made my wife and I loose our appetite while she was standing there. We finally get our food after it seems 35+ minutes.


WHILE we were eating, she came back multiple times (possibly 4 times) (After we said we were good, thank you) asking \"do you want anything else? We made it clear we would let her know if we needed anything. I've never had a waitress so inattentive to her surroundings. Nobody waved her over , she just kept coming back. We were TRYING to enjoy our date night ... And the smell of smoke came wafting back and forth everytime she came our way. It was quite nauseating. 

We were almost late to the show. The food was delcious, but we could have been enjoying it much sooner if the front staff was more contentious. Never had such rude, unattentive service in my life. I probably wouldn't come back if we had to deal with that waitress again."}
{"text":"So I'll start by saying that I'd actually give it 2 stars (for the large meat portions), but the 4 star average needs to be brought down. If you know anything about shabu shabu or hot pot, this is not the place to go. Everything is sold a la carte, which I've never seen with shabu shabu-- usually there's just a large platter of vegetables that comes with the meal and then you can add extras. And the big no-no, was the sauce! They offered only two: soy sauce (really?!) and some type of sesame sauce. That was it. Anyone who knows, shabu shabu needs a variety of dipping sauces, especially a good ginger one ;) And our order of Napa cabbage (it it was so lacking in amount) and dandelion greens looked like it'd been sitting in the pack of a truck for a few days (I've added photos as evidence). 

Even worse than the failed hot pot attempt was the inattentive service. There were only two servers in the dining room and they never checked on us. I had to flag them down whenever I needed anything and they never once asked how things were. Luckily for us we were comfortable cooking at the table, but the poor older-aged party of six across from us were freaked out and even voiced their frustration to the server that no one had come to check in with them. 

I question how Shabu Fondue has received such rave reviews other than the people who are coming are just inexperience hot pot eaters and are just in awe by the style of eating/cooking. Who knows? One thing I know for sure is that this is definitely not a four star dining experience."}
{"text":"I lived in Okinawa, Japan for 4 years and really missed going out for Shabu Shabu with my husband and friends. I decided to search for a place that served Shabu Shabu within the area. I read the reviews for this place months ago but didn't have the time to make the drive. Since my cousin and his wife came to spend Christmas with us, the four of us decided to try it out before checking out Zoo Lights. The waiter was very polite and honest of the portions given and the atmosphere felt very close to the ones I've been to back in Japan. We were very impressed, satisfied and ate to our heart's content. It was a wonderful dinner to have on Christmas. So glad to have found this place. Definitely will come back when craving a night for Shabu Shabu."}
{"text":"Shabu is excelling in many areas, and faltering in just a few. The most glaring area for improvement is in the service arena. They don't come around as frequently as they should and they keep the broth levels really low. This causes the items to stick to the bottom of the hot pot and burn. After your initial pot of broth, they refill it with pork or chicken broth - which is about the same cost as tap water - so they need not be so stingy with it.
My favorite items were the enoch mushrooms and pork dumplings. Everything else was OK, but those two items were delicious. I wasn't a big fan of the oval noodles, but my husband loved them, so we'll probably get them again. I also think it's important for the gentleman to tell you not to add too much to the broth before you start dumping large quantities of meat and veggies in... not after.
For four of us, it was $93 - and at $50/per couple, there's some room for improvement :)"}
{"text":"Not the typical Japanese Shabu. This is Chinese owned and prepared hot pot with the sesame (Goma) sauce. Instead of ponzu sauce they had soy sauce, which I didn't use at all. It doesn't come out with a set of different veggies and noodles. You have to choose from a list. Plus side was there was a good selection of protein (meats, fish, seafood), veggies, and noodles to choose from. The food was good. The downfall is that it is expensive! They need a plate with mixed veggies, proteins, noodles, and combination of all. Otherwise, it gets too expensive to want to try everything. We ended up ordering about 16 items and bill came to be about $87 + tip for 2 people!!!!

Taste: 4 stars (need ponzu sauce. Who dips with soy sauce? Need more than 1 sauce for variety of dipping sauces) 
Service: 4 stars (server checked on us but pot and set up was a little slow to start)
Price: 2.5 stars (Need combo selections as indicated above instead of one item each as it quickly adds up. Also, could lower cost or option of smaller portion for less price)
Variety of food: 4 (should have more fish options such as salmon instead of just 1 - white fish) 
Sauces: 3 starts. (Goma was good but need GF sauces. Also, get rid of soy sauce. Need ponzu/GF ponzu instead if you call it Shabu. Other sauce options would be nice too)

Overall: 3.5 - Need some work to get 5 stars"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is good for a nice date and the server was really kind. Our soup came out first and the aroma is overwhelmingly good. We arrived earlier and noticed the restaurant next door was packed. A refreshing coconut curry scent came from that direction and I would love to try that place next time. The food was just taking over 10 minutes with no other customers around. 


Uodate: food is here and it looks great!!!"}
{"text":"Love coming to this place!  They have VEGAN broths that are also GLUTEN FREE.  We always do the \"yin/yang\" where you get two broths, variety is good.  All the broths are super tasty and very different.  There are tons of options; several kinds of mushrooms, greens, noodles, tofu to choose from so it's never boring.  I highly recommend the Korean Pumpkin, and the Tofu skin!"}
{"text":"This place is great!  my friends and I come here all the time because it is a fun atmosphere and unique dining experience. The servers are always attentive and ready to help any newcomers we may bring along.  Love the spicy lemongrass and coconut curry broths! They are the best."}
{"text":"Awesome to have a shabu place in phx. Fresh healthy food, great service,  and lots of different sides and proteins to choose from. As an LA native I was thrilled to find this style of cuisine on my door step."}
{"text":"Came in for a quick bite to eat after work and I might have found my new favorite restaurant. I think I was the first customer of the night, but from the moment I walked in I was showered in excellent service. 

Fabian was the first to greet me. Cheerful from the moment I walked in. His explination of the menu items surpassed all expectation. I was surprised that someone of his skill set wasn't working at a fine dining establishment. The only bad part thing was he's not single 

After an encyclopedic review of the menu, I finally decided on beef tounge, shabu beef, bok choy, enoki mushrooms, rice noodles, and my personal favorite, udon. 
When I handed Fabian my selections I had assumed I would have enough time to smoke a smoke before my meal. 

WRONG!!!

I've waited longer for McDonald's slop than I did for a steamy pot of spicy lemongrass broth. 

No more than one minute later a different gentleman, Adrian, brought a cart full of eligently arranged meats and vegetables. As he arranged plate by plate delicately around the pot of broth, he gave a quick history of each ingredient and the best method for cooking each. Once all the food was on the table, Adrian gave me his preferred cooking order to help build a flavorful broth into liquid nirvana. Not only did he make great food better by knowing the precise moment to add new ingredients, he made me feel like a chef. (my greatest solo culinary achievement was not burning the box of Mac and cheese)

Once I ate my body weight in noodles and beef, I was treated to my final dish: Sweet Wontons. After my first bite, that's when I knew I had died and gone to heaven. Sweet and tart with the perfect crunch. I would have ordered another plate if I didn't have to purge just to make room. 

To bring this review to a close brings a tear to my eye. I only hope I will enjoy a meal such as this again. In conclusion, if you don't have a meal at Shabu Fondue, you're missing an opportunity to change your life for the better. 

I've never believed in a higher God, but I believe in Shabu Fondue."}
{"text":"Probably one of my best meals in Phoenix! Unbelievably reasonable prices, and it's super fun to make your own little meals! Fresh veggies, meat, and seafood. The waitress was working solo that night but she was on top of everything and extremely sweet!! We will definitely be back soon :)"}
{"text":"Fresh vegetables and meat. I ordered a Hot pot soup base red chilli oil. The taste is wonderful, people can not stop."}
{"text":"Wow, that was really good.   Started in RedThai for happy hour.  I highly recommend it and not just the martinis but the starters as well.  Than, we moved from the bars to eat shabu shabu.  Super good. We ate traditional and lemongrass broths with shabu beef, shrimp with spinach,  mushroom,  clear noodle and rice."}
{"text":"We left. This place seems like it *might* be kinda cool but barely getting a \"hey, yeah sit there\" right as a cross looking lady tells my family where to sit for the next half hour ( I will say, it was a nice sitting area, you could see the bar). But, the servers all seem to hate their jobs. The big projection screens stayed on the menu page of Netflix for way too long before someone put on a japanamation cartoon. However, my kids and I left because it smelled so bad. Not like fish, how some places do....the smell was permeating from the bathrooms. Just go to bed bath and beyond and buy a fondue pot and do if yourself."}
{"text":"Love shabu fondue! So glad we finally found a shabu shabu place and it has great options to put in your pot. Great broth selection as well and you can do half and half."}
{"text":"We had a fun dinner here... Mix of us shared four broths... A little chaotic but fun.  It is easy to mix and match ingredients to your liking, accommodate those who like spicy and those who do not.   Veggies, meats, seafood, shellfish....

Attentive staff, good bar from the next door Red Thai....

We will be back"}
{"text":"Hubby. Loved it! That's incredible itself.  We ordered way too much food but it was delicious! It was so much fun to cook it ourselves in the fondu pot! Fun for any occasion. A must try. It's hard to find look for red Thai Shabu is in the same place"}
{"text":"We went to Shabu Fondue for a family celebration dinner.
The ambience is sleek and modern. We found the menu to be confusing and our server was not very accommodating.
We did enjoy the fondue experience, however it would have been much better if the menu was more detailed or if the staff had explained the process better.
We had no idea of how many items to order or how much of each of the ingredients would be enough for our group.
Our hotspot on the table also quit working in the middle of our dinner.
This is a great spot for a romantic dinner. We plan on coming back for a date night soon"}
{"text":"Loved this place that I had to take the two hour drive to come back.

The service was consistent and informative. The first time we came in, we didn't really know exactly how long to leave the raw food in the soup. Our server helped us out and when the food was brought out, reiterated the instructions. Every employee that we spoke to was extremely helpful. They seem pretty attentive of your drinks and heat level of your pot. The spicy lemongrass broth was my favorite. I always look forward to coming here when I'm in phoenix."}
{"text":"Very good and AMAZING service. The waitress was very attentive as these kinds of ways of eating (Shabu) need attentive service. The price came out a little too much for our price range but the food was nevertheless amazing!"}
{"text":"Lots of options. Flavors were all very good from what we had. Did seem to rack up in price a little more than we thought. The prime lamb and shrimp with heads off were a great choice. Mushrooms are good, not great. Broccoli and noodles were a good choice. For two people we got 7 options and that was more than enough. Next time I think we would get 5 if not overly hungry, 6 if more hungry."}
{"text":"This is our new favorite since moving to Arizona in August. The atmosphere and location are good. The food is delicious. We have tried a few of the broths and they are all wonderful. The ingredients are fresh and there are lots of choices. Our favorites are the Shabu beef, the chicken and the spinach. The dumplings are the kids' favorite. Our only complaint is the staff seems overwhelmed at times. They might need more servers during busy times. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"What a fun and delicious dinner! So many choices of broth and veggies and meat ...our party of 6 all thoroughly enjoyed it. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"BOMB. I moved from CA and couldn't find a shabu and found a place finally.. I love it so much! Good for a group of 2 or 3 because you only get one pot. Awesome if you like spicy food- get spicy miso broth!! Also you cook your own food (fyi) so if you want something quick then this is not your place. Have time to spend and socialize. Cost is about $60 without alcohol. I usually get beef, broccoli, mushroom, spinach, napa, and udon noodles. I like that they don't use hot jobs and they use real peppers to make the broth spicy. It's a very healthy meal for the most part but there is quite a bit of sodium, so you leave feeling pretty full. The restaurant is dark inside and has a contemporary ambience."}
{"text":"Excellent service. So much great food. And so full but can't stop eating. Definitely bringing the whole family back!!!  The style is extra cool too"}
{"text":"Such a great find.  I'll be back again soon for sure.  I was so happy to discover that Phoenix had a hot pot restaurant.  The place is a little to upscale for the average hot pot situation, but luckily the prices are pretty reasonable.  And the food, of course, is awesome.  Who doesn't love veggies and noodles cooked in a spicy flavorful broth?"}
{"text":"So...this is Japanese nabe. We eat this at my house several times a week. It is a great way to use up whatever produce you have in the fridge before it goes bad; chop up all the veggies and meat, put it in a boiling pot of water with some ponzu and whatever other seasoning you're in the mood for and you have a simple, economical way to make a healthy meal. 
With the high prices I was expecting to have some exotic ingredients... fugu, Kobe beef and/or some extra special sauces or something... nope, we make much better nabe at home. I can imagine that to someone from a non-Asian household who doesn't always have bok choy, 5 different kinds of mushroom and tofu hanging out in the fridge, this feels like a special meal. It is good food. I understand and respect what they are trying to do, but the product doesn't justify the prices."}
{"text":"I have had Shabu in many different cities in Texas and California. This is by far the BEST Shabu I have had!  The flavor and quality of the broths/soups is exceptional.  You do not need to dip your meat in any sauce to enjoy the natural flavor of the food."}
{"text":"Hot pot in Phoenix is not all that common yet. If you are wondering what this is about the only way you can appreciate this is experiencing it. If you ever hear that Chinese food is different in China, that is mostly true when it comes to your American Chinese type take-out, but hot pot is definitely a very traditional dining experience in China. You start off by choosing your sides, for those new to this start with basic beefs and chicken and work through your veggies and pastas. 

You will need to pick your broth and this is can make or break your dinning experience.  If possible I would try their broth to see what you like best and if you are into hot food definitely go with their spicy soup. 

Be sure to ask questions to their staff to ensure you order correct, they speak English, our last place in LA was epic but nobody spoke English so we had to learn through our visits. 

Overall very excited to see Shabu in town and this place is well done with some good drinks, definitely a great date night for those who are exploring new things."}
{"text":"I love Johnny Chu, the atmosphere at his restaurants are always the best, the menu is always great. The Mr Chu martini is deeelicious! So glad there's another spot I can go to, I was almost in tears when Sochu House closed. Keep it up Johnny!!!!"}
{"text":"We had been to Tien Wong hotpot in Chandler (T-Spot) about ten times and had high hopes for Shabu Fondue. It delivered, and then some, the portion sizes tripled and the quality was identical as the old location. My only complaint was that it was uncomfortably hot in there, needed to be 5-10degrees cooler to offset all the steaming hot pots. This place remains awesome!"}
{"text":"Went to Shabu Fondue last night with a group of friends and had a GREAT time. I forgot the waiters name but he was super helpful since this was our first time and guided us on what to order! Food was ON POINT. Of course you cook it your self on the hotplate in the middle of your table but if was a fun experience and can't wait to try it again! Between 4 people it was just under 20 bucks a person which is awesome. Go and try it out!"}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere! 
Attentive and friendly service!!!
Easy menu to choose from!
Delicious broths(we tried the spicy kimchi and ginseng)!
NIce food presentation! 

*LOOK OUT!!!*
Business sign out front is super small!!!"}
{"text":"I discovered shabu when I worked in Sacramento where there are several restaurants serving this style of food, but until now you haven't been able to get it in Phoenix which I why I was thrilled to hear that this location had opened... and close to my house to boot.

For those who've never had it, shabu is an asian style of fondue, sometimes referred to as hot pot. Instead of oil, cheese, or chocolate each table has its own warmer to which they bring you a large bowl of soup broth in which you cook your food. You can even order two types of broth that come in a large container that is split down the middle.

We ordered two, the base, house broth for the kids and a slightly spicier lemongrass broth for us. We then ordered a mix of items to cook including beef, chicken, tofu, broccoli, dumplings, crab, scallops, and noodles. When they bring the items, they tell you how long each one should cook and its helpful to arrange them by cooking time starting with the longest that take 3 to 4 minutes and working down to those that take only a minute or less.

Once you have all of your food, the fun begins. My kids had a blast deciding what to try, cooking their own food, and eating with chopsticks.

Service was excellent, our server stopped by several times to see how we were doing and to adjust the heat on our hot plate. The manager (owner?) stopped by a few times as well to make sure we were having a good time and we assured him that we definitely were.

The atmosphere was fun as well. It's decorated sort of like a club and they were playing a great mix of tunes, including stuff that we used to go out dancing to in the 80s and 90s... definitely a Bright Lights, Big City type of place. The manager even mentioned that they have a DJ in the Thai restaurant next door on Friday and Saturday nights.

While we had a great time as a family, this would also be a blast for an adult night out on the town. If you've never had shabu, or you've been missing it in Phoenix, you definitely want to head on out to Shabu Fondue for an enjoyable time!"}
{"text":"The food is fine. However, if you've ever eaten at an actual Shabu spot, outside of Arizona, you'll find this place underwhelming. Also, I don't think that it's ever okay for restaurant to take parties that arrived after you to be seated before you."}
{"text":"Very courteous staff. The food is fabulous. We had the ying and yang Spicy lemongrass and oriental herb broths.  Enjoyed the broccoli, bok choy,  beef, pork,  udon noodle and egg noodle. We will return."}
{"text":"As literally the only shabu shabu restaurant in Arizona I had to come here eventually. I was going through withdrawal so I had to come here eventually.

Saturday night with a group of 2 we had maybe a 30 minute wait. We put our names down and walked to the left to have a drink at Red Thai at the bar. Had some martinis while they played a Seven Deadly Sins marathon all over the wall. Of course you'd have giant projectors of anime.

Table's ready, so we rush our drinks and close out. Turns out there wasn't any point since we could order from the same menu once we sat down -_-

Everything's a la carte - noodles, veggies, tofu, meats, seafood, and broth. They have spicy and nonspicy broths, with pork and veggie base. It'd be a waste not to do the split option. The spicy lemongrass was the best balance of fragrant and spicy, and the thai curry was kind of what I expected, less hot and slightly sweet from the coconut. Definitely enough options for any pescetarian/vegetarians/vegans though.

We went overboard trying as much as we could, to the point of even not finishing. Veggies like the chrysanthemum leaves and bok choy are the best value - the cheapest and definitely the most volume per order. The ramen noodles were nice and doughy, so they had a bite to them.

Didn't get to try to tofu, but most of the meat is good and you get a lot. Baby scallops, lamb, pork belly, and shabu beef all get my endorsement as totally worth it. The kobe beef is the most expensive, but may be worth it to you as the best bite of meat of the night by far with that marbling. The NY Strip and Pork Loin were okay, wouldn't get alone since they're leaner cuts and not the melt in your mouth experience you need at shabu shabu.

Quality of everything is on point but I wish they had some sort of limited AYCE option. There's enough options to go far for your money, but you could easily find yourself 20-30 per person or beyond. But the twists like the Chinese and Vietnamese stuff you wouldn't find at a regular Japanese place was nice. As the only shabu place here, they have my approval for a well done execution.

God damn I miss California."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite restaurant. It is so much fun! And I love bringing people here because none of them have had anything quite like this. 

The bar next door (which is kind of the same place) has awesome, and slightly weird, martinis and they are strong! The lemongrass broth is one I have to get every time I go because it is just mouthwatering. They have so many meats, veggies and noodles to pick from so each meal is never quite the same. 

Definitely a must visit kind of place!"}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place, really.  The service was HORRENDOUS.  The wait staff isn't trained or they seriously just didn't give a crap about getting fired.  Either way..not awesome.  We were given an attitude about asking for a glass to accompany a beer in a bottle.  The waitress, with 'tude, said they don't give glasses because \"that's not how its done in Asia.\"  Oh really?  Tell me more super white 21 year old girl from Phoenix lol.  We didn't ask for an explanation, we just asked for a glass.  Having to order vegetables a la carte is aggressive.  That's super cheap guys.  We brought a friend who lived in Singapore and lived on hot pot cuisine.  He gave it a \"eh...not really\".  I have to take his word for it.  It's the bad service that will keep me from coming back."}
{"text":"This place is really great! I was a little thrown aback by the simplicity of their menu. Think of like those paper slips at sushi restaurants where you order rolls, \"a la carte\". Now, apply that menu concept to things you can throw in a shabu shabu pot!

That's a relief for me. Coming from places like San Diego and Los Angeles, where the options to throw into a shabu-shabu pot are sort of \"fixed\" (like the plate of veggies is essentially always the same), it was nice to have the added choice as a customer to really fine-tune our desired selections.

I came here with my sister and from a broth standpoint, we chose the traditional pork broth. Wow, just the broth alone was light yet full of meticulous flavor! As we added more and more things to the pot, including veggies, kobe beef and NY steak, all thinly sliced, the better it tasted! 

We also opted to order some ramen noodles (read not the shitty kind you get from the grocery store, ACTUAL ramen noodles) and cooked them in the pot and it came out full of flavor again.

Finally, as far as dipping sauces go, I really like the sweet and tangy one. You'll see it when you go, it's basically orange-y colored.

From an ambiance standpoint, the restaurant really strives for a low lighting experience. At first I thought they were going for romance-theme (looking from the outside in) but once you step in and hear the music played, you realize they're actually going for a simple, hip yet casual atmosphere to enjoy some really great food!

Btw, the Saigon drink is something you gotta try if you're of drinking age :)"}
{"text":"Food was good but the service wasn't. At the first time when we sat she kept asking\" you want something else\" many time. it was kind of annoying. Then we called her to order more meat she said that the kitchen was closed already . Really really closed without noticing us. But still come back for Food."}
{"text":"An amazing date night experience! The food was high quality and fresh! Everything was delicious. We ordered the ying yang pot(choice of 2 broths) with the Ma long(spellling) spicy and the coconut curry. Both were fantastic but the spicy one is pretty spicy. Our proteins were shabu beef, New York beef, pork belly, and shrimp. We also got some veggies and noodles. 

Chef and owner was a really cool guy and stopped of at our table a few times throughout the night. You can tell how passionate he is about the ingredients he uses. 

This would be a great place for the whole family imo. You can teach your kids about the foods and they can watch them cook. 

We are already planning our next trip!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed it! Loved the double cooking broth and the spicy one was on point.  Food was fresh and Thai tea was super good. Very much worth it."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and good service. Shabu shabu was best restaurant meal I've enjoyed on awhile. Vegetarian/ vegan and meat options offered. Will return."}
{"text":"Hot pot is hard to find in Phoenix. Thank goodness for Shabu Fondue!  The vib is young with energetic dance beat music from the shared Red Thai adjacent restaurant and bar.  The server gave us all the guidance we needed.  The pot stickers and beef were wonderful.  Next time we place to order a few items, cook and eat, then order more just to keep the clutter down."}
{"text":"I love this place! Absolutely constant great customer service. The food is great. Always clean! Their water is filter. I think they put cucumbers in the water. Just wish they had more options with the veggies."}
{"text":"The hot pot was good and I was happy to see that they offered traditional offerings.  A bit expensive though for hot pot."}
{"text":"I'm not stranger when it comes to Shabu. I've eaten at so many Shabu place in California and I'll have to say this place is just as good as it is in Cali! This place is located in a very odd area and split between and Thai restaurant. Although since they don't have any competitor around them, their prices is a little on the expensive side. Seriously who charge 3.98 for enoki mushrooms when its like less than a dollar in the market. 

Besides their ridiculous prices, we got the ying yang style and chose spicy lemongrass and Chinese herbal. Both soup was very good. We also ordered their Pad Thai from the Thai restaurant next to them and it was not good. Pad Thai was very saucy and overly sweet! The waiter did warn us about it but I thought it can't be that bad and it was bad... sorry, but pad thai was not my dish. Anyways, I would only come and enjoy the shabu."}
{"text":"This place was okay. I wasn't a fan of the fact that I had to share my broth. I was also disappointed that they didn't have peanut sauce. The price was considerably on the higher side considering the options they had. If I've never had Shabu before and this was the first place I've ever tried, I might have given it a higher rating. But being I'm from LA and King Shabu Shabu is one of my favorite restaurant... it's hard to not compare the two."}
{"text":"Literally best Shabu place ever! I've even been to a legit one in LA K town, this takes the cake!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and every visit I really get to enjoy some shabu in Phoenix. Located in an unseeming plaza, this place is split between A Thai restaurant on the other side of the wall that plays anime on Big projector on the walls. The other side, this great hotpot place. I usually order the ny strip paired with tofu, baby bok chou and other proteins like lamb or seafood. I highly recommend getting the boneless short rib because it is absolutely tender. I took my friend that has been wanting to go here and she was so amazed of how tender the meat was. I recommend getting a max of 2 veggie plates like bok choy or watercress for example, they give you ALOT. Which is awesome! The service is friendly and attentive. This is a great place for hot pot."}
{"text":"Shabu Fondue has been on my \"to try\" list forever and it's one of those places that I have been kicking myself for not trying sooner. My husband and I shared a ying yang option of lemongrass and coconut curry broth and we added shrimp, wagyu, bok choy, broccoli, noodles and rice cakes. Both broths were full of flavor, I did prefer the lemongrass over the curry though. Our server was great at explaining how to cook everything and the cooking times, we loved the interactive food experience. We will definitely return for some more Shabu Shabu!"}
{"text":"Well, first let me say, the food is excellent. And   the drinks are the bomb.  Now, the service is another story.   The wait staff was pleasant.  But, here's the thing, we arrived early on a Friday evening  (5:30) and had a party of 5.  The place was basically empty.  Rather than seating us at an appropriate table for all of us to fit comfortably, they put us at a 4 top, and then adder a chair to the end aisle.  WHO DOES THAT?? We questioned this, and the manager on duty stated that they \"would get busy\" later and needed the larger tables for 6 or more.  Even though we had a vegetarian with us and wanted 2 pots AND it was her birthday, so we had gifts and other things with us that take up extra room.  He suggested we could use a 2nd booth!!  So, split our party up??  Rather than letting us use the nugget table.     Whatever, we squeezed in the single booth and it was very crowded and unpleasant!  Fondue places come with many dishes!!  And we had everything crammed on this tiny table.    Luckily the drinks were strong and the food somewhat made up for the rudeness of the manager.   By the way, ALL the big tables were still empty when we left.  I was sure glad he saved those BIG tables for those people that never showed up!  Next time maybe they'll cater to the customers who are actually there  and not the ones that may never show up!!"}
{"text":"This is a an awesome restaurant!  I like it better than their other restaurant, Yakiramen. We ordered enough for about 3 families but it was so good that we ate it all and had to be rolled out of there. Seriously tho, the ying yang with Ma La and Lemongrass broths was fantastic.  We only ordered different beef and pork meats and they were great. Next time I'll have to try the seafood."}
{"text":"Having tried hot pot first in San Francisco we were craving it and hoping they had some back home in Phoenix. Sure enough, we found Shabu Fondue. The broth options are more extensive than other places we've been to and the spicy mala had a very nice spice level and great flavor. We got 2 orders of kobe beef... I mean come on, it's kobe beef. 2 orders of lamb, an order of broccoli and an order of white beech mushrooms. Needless to say the kobe beef was amazing. The lamb was a tad fatty but had a good flavor to it. The mushrooms were great, the longer they sit in the broth the more flavor they absorb.  The broccoli is a great addition to the broth. Leave it in for 4 minutes or so and it is beautifully tender and has soaked up a very nice spice from the spicy mala broth.  Reasonably priced for hot pot even with everything being a la carte, no all you can eat option available. Portions are nice sized too. Went on a Tuesday and there was a wait.  Good sign. Service could have been more attentive, but not bad enough to keep me away from their delicious hot pot."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere- modern/Asian with a DJ. Food came out relatively quickly: we ordered the ying-yang pot (miso soup + spicy lemongrass), and then a variety of meats (beef, short-rib, lamb), veggies (two different mushrooms and baby bak-choy), pork dumplings, and noodles. Everything was fresh and robust with flavor. We ordered two Red Kissed martinis- they were delicious! The servers were very attentive and friendly. The only drawback was the wait: and they did not take call-ahead reservations. But that speaks to the popularity of the place- and the wait was worth it, and we will definitely be coming back soon! Highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Shabu Shabu.... oh my. First shabu place I try in AZ. Have been wanting Shabu Shabu for a month decided to try this place out after my vacation with a few friends who welcomed me back in to town. We ordered a split hot pot as one of my friends doesn't really eat meat. The serving was enough for 4-5 people. The lemongrass flavor is to die for! It had a kick to it. Ordered clams but there were so many shells that it was disappointing. The shrimp was delicious as well as the short ribs. One of My friend ordered squid. Let's jus say that's the first thing she looked for to eat because she said it was better than when she has it in pho. Definitely will come back."}
{"text":"This place is great! It's as good as the Hot Pots back in Seattle where I'm from. Lots of choices with good prices. Really friendly staff as well. Love it"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I loved this place so much! It was our first time and the two girls that were our waitresses were really sweet and helped us out with the menu.  We ordered the Korean Kimchi and Coconut curry broths which were so bomb and tasty... I highly recommend those flavors of broth. They have dessert there as well and I think they were called beignets but they had a bright pink sauce drizzled on top which was amazing! 

Definitely will be coming back here again for the experience and the food!"}
{"text":"Went here last night with two friends, first off our bill was $52 total- which I thought was very reasonable for a dinner for three! They kindly split our bill three ways as well.

None of us had ever done Shabu before and our waiter was kind and walked us through how to order and how to cook everything. He made helpful recommendations and suggestions and frequently checked on us to make sure we were figuring it out.

What didn't at first seem like a lot of food turned out to be plenty (we ordered 9 items).  The shrimp and shitake were my favorites.  It was a neat experience to be able to cook your own food right at the table.

The only CONS were: we were starving!  When we ordered our shabu our waiter suggested we also get some spring rolls from next door as we told him how hungry we were.  It took FOREVER for the spring rolls to come and another forever for our shabu to be served.

Other than that our experience was good and I look forward to going back."}
{"text":"The best hot pot restaurant in the valley.  We celebrated our Chinese New Year reunion dinner here.   Great choice of protein, seafood, vegetables and of course the different choices of broth/soup. My favorite was the house herbal soup.

Great service & the boss Johnny Chu came by to see how we were doing."}
{"text":"Service was great. Loved the food. I mostly enjoyed the vermicelli broth and their pork is delicious! The location is too far for me, but it's worth the drive."}
{"text":"Decided to do something different this past Friday night since football tends to consume all my husbands Saturday & Sunday's .  So we decide to visit this place based on the Yelp reviews.  

At first look pulling into the parking lot was not sure & couldn't locate it & had to call.  It's write next to the swimming tots & 99 cent store.  Their sign is a little small and since I haven't been to that area kind of confusing.  

But we were greeted & asked which side of the restaurant we wanted.  The hostess was very friendly.  Of course we choose this side.  

Their staff is very nice & helpful!  Since this was new we had lots of questions.  They were very know to explain everything to us.  

We ordered ribeye, shiitake mushrooms , broccoli, shrimp, white fish rice & egg noodles.   We had the Spicy Lemongrass & coconut curry as our cooking dips.    We loved it all & it was just enough food for me and the hubby!  We will definitely be back with friends!!!!"}
{"text":"Since discovering it, I have been here two times. Highly recommend the yin yang option when selecting your broth. Life is too short to simply pick one! Since having this dining experience on both the east and west coasts, I was ecstatic to find a place offering this cuisine in Phoenix. Location is great as there is ample parking. Depending on the night and the hour you go, the wait time can be slightly long due to their limited number of tables. The waiting staff is great, as they will help new diners out by providing suggested cooking times for each ingredient you order in case one is not familiar and want to try something new on the menu.

A few reasons why I didn't rate them a 5:
1) the waiting staff might not be as attentive as you'd like them to be
2) portion sizes are slightly pricey, though one can argue you're paying for the cuisine type and experience
3) You'd think the longest thing to prepare is the broth since it prepares cooking/heating. Ya know, since all of the food is cooked by the diners. However, both times I've come here, the broth comes out first and placed onto the heating platform. To only be evaporated 15-20% while we wait 15 minutes for the uncooked food to come out."}
{"text":"Was pretty good...definitely come back...the lamb was delicious. ..and the drinks are amazing!!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Shabu!  My first experience was fantastic.  I don't consider myself a picky eater but I do have a lot of restrictions (no gluten, grains, dairy, etc.) Shabu was the first place I've been to where I could eat all but 6 things on the menu.  I love the variety of broths that they offer and the list of vegetables is extensive that everyone will find something they want.  We had the steak, chicken, shrimp and pork loin - the meats were quality and the vegetables fresh.

I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Really bad customer service 
We shouldn't stay to eat 
Upon arrival we were mistreated 
Because of our kids 
They should say not kids friendly 
And we would have stayed away"}
{"text":"We ordered the shabu beef, pork loin, headless shrimp, and angus beef. We had the lemongrass and curry mixture. For veggies we ordered baby bok choy, korean pumpkin and chrysanthemum leaves. 

I ordered the veggies based off of other reviews and was not disappointed. Great size for two ppl! 

The meat was so tender and delicious. I enjoyed the contrast in the two different soup bases. Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"The food here was absolutely amazing and the environment here is very chill. This was my first time eating hot pot at a restaurant and I'm glad it was here. The restaurant is interesting because it's split with Thai restaurant next door with a big projector that plays anime. I came here on a Saturday night so it was definitely nice. The wait was about 15-20 minutes. 

How it works is that a family meal so you can share with the people you eat with. You pick your one broth which is $4.95 and there's a split broth option that's $5.95. Then you choose protein, veggies, and noodles. We had 3 people in my party so they recommend each person chooses 3 items so we had a total of about 11 items which they said its average for 3. 

We got the split broth with Spicy Lemongrass and Japanese Miso. The lemon grass was tangy and a little spicy but not too bad but I personally like the miso because it was more sweet.

For protein we got the Shabu Beef/$6.98, Kurobuta Pork Belly/$6.98, and the Japanese Fish Cakes/$4.68. Then for veggies we had Enoki Mushrooms/$2.68, Shiltake Mushroom/$3.68, Spinach/$3.98, and Bamboo/$3.68. Lastly we got Fried Tofu/$2.98 and Udon/$3.68

I really liked the meats because they were really tender and the udon was very tasty too with the Japanese Miso broth. I also like the house sauce on the side where you can dip your meat in because it was sweet and tangy. The whole total was $54 but split for three it was $18 for each. The waiters and waitress were very patient and kind. They explained the menu very well and came around for refill on waters and to lower or raise the heat in the stove. I'm starting to like hot pot now and I definitely want to come back!"}
{"text":"Dining at Shabu Fondue is more than just eating , it's an experience. Fondue is a communal / social experience where small pieces of food are cooked in hot oil or broth. That is what you will find here at Shabu Fondue. Upon entering the restaurant , you are warmly greeted and asked if you have dined here before. From there you are shown the 'steps' of ordering. There is not anything besides drinks, Shabu ( hot pot , which is different than Pho), and desserts here. With that, IF you don't want to partake in cooking your own food, or if you want more than this simplistic hot pot menu offers, you're in luck : Shabu Fondue is connected to Red Thai! Shabu Fondue is clean, hip and has a cool , Asian vibe with techno music bumping thru the speakers , but not too loud, just enough for ambience. The tables are set up with the burner for the hot pot in the middle ...& the ordering menu, much like a sushi ordering menu, is placed too. The waitress walked us through ordering our first Shabu Shabu, ( let it be known that a singular 'Shabu' in Japanese means heroine!, although I will say THIS Shabu Shabu could become addictive!) She recommended nine ingredients for the three of us. We did the Ying Yang: two broths that are split in the cooking pot. We did the Coconut Curry and the Spicy Tomato. Both had a little kick but not overwhelming! We ordered : Grass Fed/ Organic Shabu Beef; Head Off Shrimp; Chicken; Bamboo; Watercress; Shiitake Mushrooms; Pork Dumpling; Udon Noodle; Flat Oval Rice Noodle. THIS was a lot ! In a few moments, all of these ingredients and the pot of broths showed up for us to get started with. I could have done without the chicken and the flat rice oval noodle... not for anything more than we just had too much food and didn't finish it all! I am not sure about the recommendation of nine ingredients , as we had both broth and ingredients left and we were all full! There are also two sauces served : a hoisin and a peanut type. The wait staff guides you on how long to cook each ingredient and checks on you throughout the dining experience to be sure all is okay! They even refill the broth base over and over!  Shabu Fondue has a great selection of beers , wines and cocktails! When the fondue is thru, you can move next door for a more traditional bar experience for a nightcap. My tip: show up early like we did on First Friday and we got right in... the place was full within an hour! Also, go 'less' on the ingredients , unless you have a gi-normous appetite!!! You can always add more! This is a fun experience ... can't wait for the cooler months , as this will be the perfect place to go to warm up! Shabu Shabu!"}
{"text":"We love shabu Fondue! So delicious and authentic. The only thing that would make this place better would be better trained staff. It's confusing when you walk in who to see at the hostess stand to be seated in shabu as they share the entrance with another restaurant. Also, our waiter really was a the bus boy, who didn't know the menu well and forgot about us a few times. The rest of the staff was great though and the owner always comes by the make sure you are enjoying the meal."}
{"text":"The one star is for the lemongrass fondue broth. It was full of flavor.  
Now...
Lets talk about what went terribly wrong with our dinning experience-
The scallops were brought to the table frozen in a bowl so they needed to be chiseled apart.  The shrimp was also frozen.  
The worst part was the seafood items were extremely fishy.  :(  YUCK! = cheap fish! 

Now lets talk about the vegetables.  The broccoli was brown on the stems an the florets were wilted.  The taste was flavorless.  Based on appearance, the broccoli had been sitting in the back of the refrigerator for at least a week.  Vegetables SHOULD BE FRESH!  

Based on the food quality I'm appalled this place charges so much.  
Service was a 3 out of 5 as we had to ask staff to take our empty bowls that once contained the semi frozen raw meats away.  

I don't enjoy writing negative reviews but I felt it was important to let any foodie know this place has low standards and the quality is absent so spend your money else where."}
{"text":"The first time I went, the husband and I took my mom when she was in town and I didn't get a great over all impression. In fact, I was slightly disappointed. Our server took FOREVER between courses. There is a difference in taking time to let us enjoy our experience since fondue IS an experience, not just a regular dinner but this was over the top. Also... my silverware was dirty and I had to send it back and request a new set. Ick. 

We decided to try it again being that the last time we went it was rather late on a Sunday night. 

Our second experience was better but they still took a long time to switch out fondue pots and get us started on our next course. 

The food, once  you finally get it, has always been tasty. I order the beef and shrimp combo. The chocolate fondue desserts are very good and they offer a decent selection of fruits and such for it. I must say my best fondue experience was in California though... that place even topped The Melting Pot, which I love. 

I would say this place is a good alternative to the pricey Melting Pot, good for a date or a group of friends, not so great for a special dinner or anything. They have a nice bar and everything is a fair price."}
{"text":"We entered and realized that the Shabu is adjoining to Red Thai once seated we ordered our drinks beer, water and pad Thai martini all were good   We ordered the ying yang broth the miso and spicy lemon grass along with clear noodles Kobe beef, pork belly, shrimp, dumplings, spinach and bak Choy. The broth was flavorful and the meats and vegetables fresh. Dumplings were good too the staff provided instructions if you needed.  We also ordered an appetizer from red Thai sugared pork or something like that which was very flavorful but in the end really not necessary. We all agreed that we would go back and would also like to try red Thai which had a whole different vibe."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Shabu Fondue! The food and service are fantastic. Shelby, Fabian, and Johnny always remember us, are very friendly, and provide great service! The food is so fresh and delicious. I recommend the shabu beef, pork belly, and quail eggs (and everything else, really!)."}
{"text":"Great little hidden gem! Food is so yummy. Love how I can order the same foods but change the flavors every time. They box the leftovers for you and everything."}
{"text":"My wife is Asian and lived in the town where Shabu was invented.  Let's face it, Phoenix does not have a huge number of Asian restaurants compared to Dallas or New York (we have lived in both).  I had moderate expectations coming here.  We were pleasantly surprised.  The service was good, the food was tasty, and the price was reasonable to a little expensive.  Overall it is a fun and unique place to go to have a good meal and an experience."}
{"text":"Solid Three

Pretty good food, careful when ordering and its a very fair price. The service is lousy and the restrooms smelled so bad I couldn't wash fast enouph.
I will probably try again, but darn service is a nightmare."}
{"text":"As the only hotpot place that I know of, I love this place. Despite the unfortunate luck that I came here towards the end of the night where most of their stuff was sold out, I had a really solid meal. Only regret that I had was that the ma la broth wasn't as spicy as I thought it was going to be. It was good though, but my friend's broth was somehow spicier than mine. I really need to come here earlier to try everything on the menu, but the place is definitely solid and worth the time to stop in. Bring friends and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Excellent experience, great flavors. The staff asked if it were or first time and went through the menu for us, making it much easier to order. I love that we can order small plates, or from a regular restaurant menu.

We ordered the lemongrass soup and coconut curry--the lemongrass was bright, sour, and spicy, and Curry tasted creamy. Enjoyed both soups with the Korean squash, shabu beef (definitely get this), shrimp, tofu, and shimeji brown mushrooms (tastes like avocado). All this, and one bowl of noodles was enough to fill two stomachs and not break the bank!

Thank you to the servers who also told us how long to cook each item for!"}
{"text":"As a hotpot snob I may have a bit harsher opinion than what your average person will review. Also this place tends to attract a lot of non Chinese ppl due to location/decor and name so keep in mind what sort of tastes/preferences you are looking for.

Breaking it down: 

No place to make your own sauces. I'm used to NYC hotpots giving you 12 ingredients to make your own delish sauces. I miss things like hot oil, sesame oils, peanut butter paste, chives, cilantro, scallion, etc. They give you a chili hot oil if you ask for it, and normally they give you peanut butter paste and soy sauce. Peanut butter is the most common thing to use for hotpot but this place has EXTREMELY watered down peanut butter paste. The density is actually like that of water. I was very surprised when I went to mix in some soy sauce and chili that it flowed like water...And yea it ruined the taste quite a bit.

Next up, lamb, the king of hotpot ingredients. Honestly it was quite rough, very chewy and just tasted old. Pork belly on the other hand was quite good, along with the beef. The egg noodle was good. I don't recommend clams because they get lost and you just get the shells and have to fish it out...oftentimes leading to just getting the overcooked clam meat at the bottom when you're all done. Bok choy and spinach were great. Ingredients are somewhat limited (see pictures someone posted the menu)

Broths, they have a few spicy options, and somehow ran out of the most popular & spicy option. This was disappointing because we got the next spiciest broth and added siracha and dried red chilies and it was still not spicy at all. It was about 1/3 of a hot cheeto. Blah, very average overall and I was really hoping for a genuine experience. 

Recommendations to the restaurant: 1. Get a thicker peanut butter paste sauce/offer more sauces to begin with (ideally a make your own area). 2. Get/serve better lamb. 3) have spicier broths/don't run out of your most popular broth because thats sorta like mcdonalds running out of big macs...

If you're ever in NYC, check out 99 Favors and or Hou Yi Hotpot, you will thank me forever (get reservations)."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Very friendly service as well.

Got 2 broths, Thai and Chinese, with 2 meats (shabu beef and pork loin), 2 vegetables (shiitake mushroom and napa cabbage), 1 house special firm tofu, and oval noodles."}
{"text":"Lot's of fun.  Want an interactive meal experience?  This is it.  Don't worry if you don't know what to do, the wait staff are happy to guide and coach.  Try it out, then try it again.   I'm going to."}
{"text":"We had dinner last night and we will definitely be going back. The place next door which is connected is okay Thai food, but this place is great hot pot. The service was great and the broths SO delicious. We ate a lot for a reasonable price. This is the type of place where you have to not be picky and willing to try combos and put a little work into your meal. LOVED it!"}
{"text":"The best Shabu in Phoenix! Well, OK the only Shabu in Phoenix! Even so, very good quality for a very reasonable price. We especially like the option of ordering two different broths along with the great selection of meat, veggies, and a wonderful variety of exotic mushrooms. Alcohol is available as well. If the place not \"hip\" enough for you (but I doubt it), Red Thai is the sister bar/restaurant next door that features an entire wall screen playing nonstop Naruto!"}
{"text":"Shabu Fondue is a casual Hot Pot Restaurant. They offer many quality proteins to choose from, vegetables, tofus (including house made), noodles and more that get cooked by YOU dipping and swishing food in a broth hot tub. You have your choice of nine broths that are either vegetarian or not and an option to split the pot into two selections. A server advises you on how long to cook things. 

The difficult part is deciding on what you want to try and how many selections that you should make so it's important to ask any question that you might have. 

Our server recommended 3-4 options per person but also suggested to get less than you think because you can always add on. We also didn't know what beef to pick but our server was helpful and suggested the Angus Beef Short Rib. We made our selections and before we knew it a big Bubbling Pot arrives with all the sides we ordered. 

It's important to only cook a little at a time or you will have over cooked food and lots of cold food.

We split our pot with Spicy Mala Broth and the Spicy Lemongrass. Both were absolutely delicious.....(but I did like the lemon grass more). We started with White Fish and some of our vegetables. The Fish and vegetables Tasted Great and very flavorful in both broths.

We also tried the Chicken in both broths with some vegetables. We both liked the Chicken more in the lemongrass. The flavors really rocked!

Then we try the Angus Short Rib with some vegetables. The Beef was very good and really did melt like butter in the mouth.....We both thought the beef was better tasting in the Mala Broth. By this time I'm over stuffed but my husband isn't.

We saved the Egg Noodles for last with some vegetables. My husband got to eat all the noodles with remaining vegetables himself so I guess for us 7 selections were about right. 

Service was helpful and efficient. The servers all work as a team so everyone takes care of you.

In the end the food was absolutely delicious and this also was a relatively great value that I also appreciate.

YUM!"}
{"text":"To begin...their signage out front is small and vague. Perhaps they should indicate that there are two restaurants within its one suite?! 

The meat selection was decent but I have an issue with imitation scallops being labeled and sold as the real deal....disappointing. Everything here is \"a la carte.\" And they definitely over charge for less than ordinary vegetables and meat. 

Shabu is Japanese...the restaurant in itself is Thai...it's definitely confusing as their most basic Thai dish, papaya salad was below average...actually it was simply gross. Shabu broth selection was numerous but it was simply flavorless and temperature heat hot...too hot. 

Overall it was less than average and the service was mediocre at best. Considering the price that they charge....eating a bowl of Tom Tom soup elsewhere or a bowl of pho (Vietnamese) or even Ramen (anywhere but here) would have been more satisfying than this place."}
{"text":"Great little place and one of the few that do Shabu Shabu. I loved the Thai lemongrass flavored broth a lot. We will certainly return."}
{"text":"I lived in France for a few years, and I'm a bit of a cheese snob.

I found the cheese here to be much, much better than Melting Pot.

I do have to agree with the other reviewer in that it really was quite expensive, and each time I've visited the place was nearly empty....."}
{"text":"I came with my BF and another couple earlier tonight. We had a great first time experience! We shared one yin and yang pot (split pot so we can try two soups.) We chose spicy lemongrass and coconut curry for our soup base, the two choices were very yummy! We had four orders of shabu beef, two types of tofu, fish cake, enoki mushrooms, and napa cabbage. We could have done without the fish cake, but everything else went really well with the two soup bases. Their peanut dipping sauce is SO GOOD, like really good. I dipped everything in that amazing sauce!!! We also had rice and glass noodles with the dish. They also came by and refilled our soups FOR FREE. Can't wait to come back and try more soups! Only downside was the wait.. they oddly brought out the soup first and our sides came out fifteen minutes later.. wish they could have waited to bring out our soups when everything was ready!"}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant. Decided to randomly pick a new place to try. Service was subpar but the food was great. I will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Spicy lemongrass and miso! Spicy to mild. Perfect mixture. If you've never had Shabu before, inform the servers (they'll ask anyway) and they'll help you every step of the way! I've had Shabu when living in Orange County, so I knew a thing or two, but the server still gave some recommendations that I never knew that were very helpful in our dining experience here.

Spent the evening cooking Shabu Beef, Bok Choy, Korean Melons, Flat Rice Noodles, and some other veggies. Ordered the noodles in the end to finish off the meal with a little noodle soup!

When walking in the front door, it's an entrance to two restaurants FYI so make sure you go into the right one. They usually seat you at a table so you wait for a hostess or server.

The atmosphere is pretty hip and modern with an Asian theme."}
{"text":"I love this food and the vegan options.  Service is great! 4 people in a booth with 1 soup pot is too crowded, 1 pot for 2 people is better."}
{"text":"The broth here is killer. We had the coconut curry and Chinese herbs. The portions to put into the hot pot are large. Our server said 6-8 items for two people. We had a ton left over but it was all so good."}
{"text":"In town for Spring Training, we decided to check out Shabu Fondue! Party of eleven. Five adults and six kids, we showed up at 8:15pm, 45 minutes before closing. This place was FANTASTIC!  Very welcoming! They did such a great job explaining to us how it worked and how to order. Kids had a blast. Parents had a blast. They even kept the kitchen open a bit longer for us! Kobe Beef was so good and make sure to cook the baby corn for as long as you like ... 10 minute baby corn is the best! : )
We are for sure coming back to AZ for Spring Training and Shabu Fondue will for sure be a stop on our future trips!"}
{"text":"I only gave this place a 3 star because the service wasn't the best . Took a long time to get our order taken and not much attention to the table to see if we wanted more drinks etc.. 
The concept and food was awesome ! Definately worth a try if u have never been. I haven't seen another hit pot place like this in phoenix so it's a unique experience here.. there is actually a Thai restaurant that's part of this so make sure u go to the hot pot side and not the Thai side.."}
{"text":"I REALLY wanted to be able to give this place 4, or even 5 stars, but I had to take one off because of the service. I'll get to that in a minute, because the food is worth being the main focus. 

The entrance is a little confusing, as it sits right next to Red Thai. People kept coming in, thinking they were going into Red Thai, which is directly to the left of Shabu Fondue. Same hallway, different doors. It's weird. 

We went with the ying-yang broth, and opted for the coconut curry and lemongrass. We figured the flavours would be complimentary enough, without being too similar or glaringly different, and we were right. 

We ordered the Shabu beef, pork belly, baby bokchoy, Korean pumpkin, udon noodles, and shrimp. The star of the meal was definitely the Shabu beef, though I think the pork belly ran a very close second. The Korean pumpkin was surprisingly good, especially in the curry broth. I think I would have liked a little more noodle, especially for two people, but it wasn't too bad. The bokchoy was fine, definitely a good choice, and the shrimp was just sort of blah. Based on that, I think we may skip the shrimp and just stick to the land meats. The portions of the meats and veggies were more than ample, with the pork belly and beef sliced super thin. We left completely full, with no room for dessert, trying to decided who had enough room to finish the last piece of pork belly.

The key is to pay attention to the cooking times. When they say no more than 30 seconds, they mean it. Throw it is, fish it out. Don't let it sit in the broth and turn into a piece of shoe leather! Both the meats were so tender, and neither broth overpowered the actual flavour of the meat itself. 

In the end, my lady friend decided she preferred the lemongrass to the curry, and I think I enjoyed the curry more, but then I'm a curry fiend! 

Now for the reason I had to take a star off... The service. The service was awful. We were seated, handed water, and a menu, and that was it. After about 10 minutes the server came back and asked if we were ready, we said we still needed a couple minutes, and asked if we could order drinks. A few minutes after that, a different server (this one a dude) came up to take our order, and hand us our drinks. He seemed disinterested and distracted, and it's not like they were busy. We got there soon after they opened for dinner on a Sunday, and there were only us and 2 other tables, both of whom had already placed their orders. He rushed through our order, then left. Came back a little while later to get our broths going, said nothing, left again. Came back a little while after that to bring us the meats etc. Ran through the instructions ridiculously fast: Beefis15to20secondsbokchoyis30secondsnoodlestwominutes etc... Then left again. We didn't see anyone else until we were almost done with our meal, and I had to flag someone down to get more water. No one came to check on us at any point during our meal, and both of our drinks were completely empty. We had to flag them down to get our check, too. That they brought back pretty quick. 

I've been to Red Thai next door (same owner), and the service there is always great. Not sure what was going on at Shabu Fondue, but I just wasn't impressed with the service at all. If the food hadn't been so good, I probably wouldn't go back, it was that bad. However, the food really was excellent, and we're excited to go back and try the different broths, and different meats."}
{"text":"The broths are so delicious and the add-ins are always fresh. We had the spicy broth and the house herbal broth. The broths are so good by themselves and somehow get even better by the end of the meal after  all the add ins simmer and marinate in the soup. I also don't  feel guilty after eating at Shabu Fondue because  the broth is not greasy and the ingredients are fresh. There were a lot of new customers around us and they all seemed very satisfied with their meal. If you have never tried hot pot, you need to try it now... at Shabu Fondue."}
{"text":"I was never a big fan of shabu shabu joints because they are pretty pricey. My whole bill for three people was about 89 dollars, only because we ordered their expensive meats which was okay. I did enjoy their broth! We ordered miso base and their spicy house from what I remembered. This place is a great place to take with groups and family that enjoy drinking soup and other meats and vegetables to go with. Their service isn't the best so that's the down part of this place, it's like the servers don't want you there from my experience. Hopefully this place will last because I do love their food!"}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Daniel Powter - Bad Day)

You stand in the line just to hit a new place
You're taking a smile with a drink to go
You tell me your taste been way off line
You're falling to pieces every time
And we should go Bo Biting on....

We want Shabu Shabu
We're talkin Shabu Fondue
We try a hot pot just to share it around
You say you don't know
What you want me to try
You cook some bok choy and you go for the beef

We had a good day
The cameras don't lie
We're coming back down and we really don't mind
We had a good day
We had a good day

Overall and pretty hot spot for some hot pots!

I came here with a friend whom never been to Shabu before in her life!  What the heck girls been  missing out; poor thing!  Needless to say I was proud to have introduced her to the meal.  She was a vegetarian so we went for the vegetarian broth; Coconut Curry and Tum Yum.  The curry broth was a little to spicy for the both of us and the Tum Yum was perfect.  The pot itself is duel pot so splitting and sharing was perfect!  

As for the food we spent the night cooking Baby Bok Choy, Korean Melons, Flat Rice Noodles, Shabu Beef, Scallops, Broccoli, Fish Balls, and Watercress.  Doesn't seem like a lot but boy when you start to cook and eating its a mouthful!

Overall, experience was excellent!  I love Shabu and Shabu Fondue delivers to my liking.  The atmosphere is modern and hot with a funky Asian theme.  Red Thai is next door was a full on bar to finish the night and dessert so why not huh! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Only giving this place 3 stars because of the food being good. Service each time I've come here is HORRIBLE, and slow. I had to wait nearly 20 minutes just for the broth to come out. Each table around me was getting their meats/veggies what seemed like every minute. Waitress wouldn't even update us on the status of food, or even say anything. Would just drop off the food and leave. Would recommend the food, if you don't mind waiting, and dealing with slow and horrible service."}
{"text":"I went for my birthday dinner last night.  One of the best meals I have had.   This place is very consistant with their food.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This was our first experience with the hot pot style of cooking, and we will definitely be back!
For those that don't know, hot pot cooking is also known as Asian fondue. They bring you a big bowl of hot broth and set it on the warmer at your table, then you cook the meats and veggies at the table, making your own soup. 
This was a great first experience. The service was really friendly and the only hitch there was that the waiter kept forgetting to fill my husband's water glass. He happily explained everything to us though. The menu was easy to understand and order from, and prices were very reasonable considering the amount of food involved- after tax and tip we spent right around $40 for the two of us and we were stuffed.
The food was great overall. The house broth was a bit on the bland side- we added a bunch of soy sauce and (delicious) sesame seed sauce to the broth itself rather than to our individual bowls. The meats were thin sliced so that they cooked quickly in the hot broth, and portions of everything were generous. For the meats we ordered lamb and shabu beef and they were both great and cooked up well. We could probably have gotten by with one fewer orders of veggies and been less stuffed at the end of the meal. We picked broccoli, mushrooms, taro, and baby bok choy. I would have skipped the taro as it broke down too quickly in the hot broth and had an odd texture after that, but that was our mistake not the restaurant's. The oval noodles we ordered held up surprisingly well though.
If this is what hot pot is and how it's done, I'm definitely a fan!"}
{"text":"This place has become my new favorite restaurant and as I sit here writing this review (and procrastinating work), I'm contemplating whether or not I should guilt trip my boyfriend into taking me for the second time this week.  (I probably will).

Anyway, this place is SO UNDERRATED.  It's in this dinky strip mall, which makes you question your decision.  But don't judge the restaurant by the poorly marked parking lot, you NEED to go in and eat their delicious food.

Get the lemongrass broth.  Don't even worry about the others.  They're not as good.  I've tried them.  Just get the lemongrass.  It's by far the most flavourful and least MSG-y one they have.

Service is also top notch here.  No, the waiters here aren't bubbly, but it doesn't mean they're not good at their jobs.  My peanut sauce never runs dry (v. important), they're constantly adjusting the heat on the pots (also v. important), and they're always very honest with their suggestions.

Portion control is the biggest challenge here, as you don't want to over-order, but you also want to try EVERYTHING.  I have a pretty big appetite and two plates of meat was enough for myself and my boyfriend.  

Here are a few things you should definitely try:
 - Iced Tofu - when you freeze tofu it turns into little soy sponges and they soak up the broth and sauce oh-so-good.  Make sure you don't overcook!
 - Prime Lamb - even if you don't really think you like lamb or have never tried lamb, this is a good start.  Because the lamb is sliced so thinly, it doesn't have that usual gamey lamb taste.
 - Enoki Mushrooms - Not super earthy, so great for people who don't really \"like\" mushrooms.  They soak up the peanut sauce really well and have an amazing texture.
 - The wagu beef, when they have it - self explanatory.

All in all, always a great experience here.  Worth the trek to central PHX.  Go check it out!"}
{"text":"I took my less adventurous daughter here one evening because I personally love fondue ever since I first had it in Switzerland.  She said she wasn't that hungry and didn't want \"the works\" so we just got the Swiss cheese fondue and the dessert fondue.  It was more than enough--we had to take some of the chocolate home to finish later!  Both were as delicious as I hoped and the service was very good.  We sat at a counter rather than a table but that's fun to do once in awhile.  I have no complaints.  We intended to come back here before I returned to San Diego but there were so many fun little restaurants to try that we just never made it back.  Maybe next trip!"}
{"text":"Don't mind if I fonDO! (see what I did there?)

I've been here three times already and it's about time I write a review. Every experience I've had here has been great. All the staff is very helpful in explaining the ingredients to you and how things work. If you don't want to cook your own food, go next door to Red Thai and quit your bitchin'. This is the kind of place that you go to for the experience of fondue where you cook your food and have some drinks. 

All their ingredients taste really fresh. Our favorite two broth combo is Spicy Lemongrass and Coconut Curry. I really like that you can choose between chicken broth or vegetable broth as a base. When your broth gets low, they will come by and add some more of whichever base you have chosen. Definitely try the pork belly and baby bok choy! The servers will give you advice on how many items to start with. You can always start out with just a few and add more as you go. 

This is one of those places where you want to take your friends, which we have done and they loved it. It's fun to go in groups but it's also perfect for two! So yea, you can say this place ain't too Shabby (see what I did there?)"}
{"text":"Came to try a new place with the family and honestly i didn't know what to expect.  However they had awesome customer service and the food was awesome.  My little one is very picky eater and tonight i didn't have to fight with no one to eat.  There was something for everyone.  Very cool experience.  Definitely will be returning."}
{"text":"I've gone to this place to eat a couple times already. I love hot pot but arizona doesn't seem to have many..actually this is the only hot pot place I was able to find. The first time I came I tried their lemon grass broth (they said it's the most popular) but it broth itself was pretty bland. Second time around I tried the spicy ma la broth? I think that's why it's called. And I also had the Chinese herbal broth. The herbal broth definitely was not that tasteful. The spicy ma la broth was better though. I like that the test of the three I've tried. Although it's also a little bland but after cooking all of the meat and other stuff it's there the broth tasted better. 

Dishes wise I ordered beef, lamb, enoki mushrooms, fried fish ball puff, and udon. All of which were fresh and tasteful so I have no complaints. Overall this satisfied my hot pot cravings.

Oh yeah, prices were ok."}
{"text":"The food was so delicious and fun to cook with the whole family! Even my 9 year old brother had fun cooking the shrimp and noodles! The chef was very friendly and came out to talk to customers! A must try!"}
{"text":"I love the food! The staff is nice and always helpful. My only problem is a couple of the times we have been they have ran out of a meat or vegetable."}
{"text":"The wait was long but that's because we had 14 people and they have a first come, first serve policy.  It was well worth it.  It wait staff (2 people) had it under control and the food was awesome!  I'll definitely come back and highly recommend it to anyone in the mood for a hot pot fix!!!"}
{"text":"1st time eating here and it was delicious! Got the yin & yang broth pot, coconut curry & Korean kimchi ! With 6 sides, portions were filling! Can't wait till cold weather and some shabu to warm me up ! FORSURE gonna be back !"}
{"text":"I'm no stranger to Shabu and was never a fan, but I was in the mood to try it again when this new restaurant came up on my Yelp app. Here are my recommendations:

-Try the Ying Yang option for broth to pick two: we ordered the spicy lemongrass and coconut curry - my fave was the spicy lemongrass

-Shabu Beef (a generous portion for two)

-Sweet Shrimp Head Off 

-Baby Bok Choy

-Shitake Mushrooms

-Skip the Squid and Asian Clear noodles 

Hubby also ordered a beer. Total Bill: $50 

If I skipped the squid and noodles since I didn't enjoy them at all, bill would be $10 less. 

This restaurant is definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"One of the best experiences I have had. My S.O. and I celebrated our 3 year anniversary here. Though the wait was 30minutes we were able to sit at the bar and enjoy a very unique and yummy martini. The food was to die for and the service was wonderful. The atmosphere was fun yet simplistic. It was beautiful, fun and completely different. I will be coming back to this place again due to the wonderful experience we had!"}
{"text":"Its our third visit. First one we were declined service because it was late.
Second time was fun and this Friday was our best experience of all.

We were a group of 4 people and ordered Wagyu, pork, lamb , NY strip and squid.

It was delicious. Really fun and tasty meal. 

My only disappointment was with the green leaves - it was a plate of lettuce. Honestly, who boils lettuce in their food?"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place and my sister found it through Yelp. I love the spicy flavors of the soups and the many things u can put in. also the lemongrass broth is by far the best one to go with and with beef and pork belly with veggies can't go wrong. :)"}
{"text":"This place is quite expensive, for a fondue experience that was kind of lacking. We had the Margarita cheese fondue, which was pretty good (soft pretzels, OMG), then he had shrimp and chicken, while I went with prime rib. His was soooooo boring. Mine was ok. The broth was forgettable, but the horseradish sauce was really good. My breath, not so much, but it made the meat much more interesting. Decent assortment of veggies, but I felt like I was in Munchkinland, with the portions. The dessert... well, who can go wrong with chocolate and caramel? Only chocolate and peanut butter would have topped that. 

The service was... mmmm, well, I went with my standard 18%. It wasn't bad, it wasn't good. It just was. 

Two stars for the experience falling way short of the usual fondue expectation, and for having to stop and get a something to munch afterwards."}
{"text":"Shabu my Fondue!! This place is the tits!! 

 I had previously been to the Thai restaurant connected before Sabu was finished and abosoltely loved the food so I knew I wanted to come back to try the new concept!
My boyfriend and I came here for date night - I was overly excited as I have been dying to try this place - and it did not disappoint. 
We were instantly greeted and asked to wait just a moment before being seated as they got our table ready and waters down. 
We were given the menu and a run down of how everything works. Can I mention they have SE Asian beer options - I was so freaking happy!! 
We ended up ordering the Shabu Steak (I would recommend getting the Wagu), deheaded shrimp, ice tofu (AMAZING- soaked in ice water and this technique allows the tofu to soak up all the flavor of the broth), broccoli, babycorn, watercress, the Enoki (string white mushrooms), baby bokchoy (you get a lot), rice noodles and rice - yes we over ordered and don't care because we were in fat kid heaven. Another visit we have ordered the scallops, lamb, chicken, organic beef - all of which I cannot complain. They were all great flavor and taste. 
We did the Ying Yang broth - the House Spice & House Herbal each unique in flavor - you can also get it vegetarian style which is awesome!  My favorite combination is the lemongrass and house spice! Soo good. 
It such a fun experience and would recommend to anyone looking for a fun date spot or even a group event (they have a long table down the middle for large parties).  Service, food, atmosphere all exceeded my expectations and cannot wait to go back - probably this weekend."}
{"text":"Worst experience I've had at a restaurant. I just walked out.  Friday night my Girl friend and I decided to try this place out. We waited 15 mins to be seated, took only a few mins to order the food. Keep in mind the food is raw, you have to cook it in a hot pot. 30 mins go by the servers don't even acknowledge the wait time. I'm sitting there with a boiling pot waiting for my meats and veggies. This is raw frozen food people you cook your self at your table.  I can't even get I'm sorry for the wait or even an eye contact. I just decided to walk out of the place. Close to an hour from putting my name on the list to getting nothing done but sit at the table. Watching water bubble and boil. Johnny Chu I hope you're reading this."}
{"text":"Don't get confused with the combined building entrance.  Shabu is on the right.  The scene is really nice and it's probably the best shabu shabu place without a reservation.  It's still pretty pricy.  Shabu shabu is a social way of eating.  Please bring friends so you can enjoy yourself."}
{"text":"This is the closest to authentic Chinese hot pot we've found locally. Fresh and tasty... We're repeat customers."}
{"text":"This is a very good Shabu place to eat. I would have to say it's better than some Shabu places in San Diego. Must get the homemade saty sauce, this really enhanced the miso broth we got. My son is a very picky eater and he commented that he loves this place. Price is very reasonable for the portion. As for their martinis, they really top it off where your first sip will be with the martini sitting on the table. We will definitely be stopping by here every time we visit Arizona!"}
{"text":"I love this place, best hot pot in Arizona, I drive up from Tucson to eat their hot pot :)"}
{"text":"I feel I could make better hot pot at home. The portions that you get here are pretty small for the price that you are paying. I am used to the hot pot places (like little sheep) in los angeles and vancouver that bring you pounds of items instead of just little dishes."}
{"text":"The only hot-pot place we found in Phoenix! Love the ying-yang option with two different broths; we usually get the spicy lemongrass and the coconut curry! Everything's really fresh and flavorful; we order different varieties of meat (our favs include prime lamb and shabu beef), shrimps, pork dumplings, baby bok-choy, Korean pumpkins, shiitake & enoki mushrooms, rice noodles, tofu)... Such an awesome experience!!"}
{"text":"So if you're a fan of soup and even more of a fan of choosing your own ingredients, this is definitely the spot to check out.  First off in terms of the ambiance, this is not a restaurant that even looks like it belongs here in Phoenix.  This has that cool East coast or LA low key yet high end type of feel.  Great place to take a date if you want a fun dining experience.
The broth selection was excellent from the spicy and lemon grass broths to the flavorful curries.  Then there's the extended menu and the bountiful ingredients.  Choose you own adventure and truly it is one.  Pork belly was amazing and I would advise (if you like seafood) getting the shrimp and clams especially for the curry.  I'll probably try out the Waygu beef next time.  Even the veggie selection is great for those non meat lovers and don't forget to get the enoki mushrooms. 
Food was great, atmospherewas great and to top it off the staff was very friendly.  I'd go here again for sure even when it hits 100 + in temps.
Next adventure will be its sister company Red Thai. Again, another out of the box concept by the chef and owner.  You'll need to check that out as well cuz it's a trip.  First thing you see is a large wall with Japanese anime playing throughout.  Must see and must experience!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service all around. Among my favorite places and I will continue to patronize mr chi for his innovation and culinary brilliance!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fondue fan and I really enjoyed Shabu Fondue.  I've been to The Melting Pot and preferred the ambiance of Shabu Fondue better.  It's more quaint and cozy.  The food was delicious; the sauces were flavorful and I was full!  It's a bit pricey, however, it was worth it."}
{"text":"I went with a friend and we both left VERY full! The price wasn't bad but quickly added up with all the toppings of the soup. The spicy lemongrass IS DELICIOUS!! The topping portions are also large. I believe we got 8 different toppings all together and did not finish everything (bill was about 64$). I would def recommend. They have a small staff so be patient. This is not a fast dining place so plann to be there for at least 2 hours. We spent 2.5 hours here all together and had a good time."}
{"text":"Such an awesome experience! Everything is fresh and delicious! Staff is helpful as well. A little on the pricier side but definitely manageable. We will be back!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing! I ordered the organic beef, bok choy, shiitake mushrooms, chicken, udon noodles, and dumplings. Also for the broth, I chose spicy lemon grass. Again, the food was great! The service was slow though. The server took awhile to take our order and it took awhile for our food to come out. Other than that, I enjoyed it here."}
{"text":"I am normally hesitant with Asian foods because I have Celiac disease and it's often hard to narrow down safe foods, additionally, I am just not really a soup person.

However, I am now a Shabu Fondue person, 100%.

The restaurant is a very whimsical atmosphere and we were seated quickly. The menu is almost like a sushi restaurant where you mark off what all you would like.

We opted for a yin yang pot (with two broths) with a miso and a red curry of some sort. The waitress was extremely knowledgeable about the items and broths that were gluten free, which is always a plus. Additionally we had beef, pork, Napa cabbage, rice noodles, taro, bok choy, and tofu to add.

Because the heating element is on the table top, we were able to reheat the broth each time the waitress added more. She always brough us more spice to add to our spicy broth once it had become watered down.

Between for of us, it was about $20 a person, but it was *so* delicious and we were so full. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I got the coconut curry and lemongrass as my two broth flavors. First time there! I enjoyed the shabu beef, enoki mushrooms, and clear noodles. I really enjoyed the broth flavors. I drank some more as soup and it was delicious! Service was great. I would come back again to try more dishes!"}
{"text":"This is the best shabu shabu (\"hot-pot\" in Japanese) that I've ever tried in U.S.. You can choose two kind of special and tasty broths as the base of pot. We ordered House Chinese Herbal and Japanese Miso, both are healthy and relative light soup.

-For meat, I highly recommend New York Angus beef, Beef Tongue and Prime Lamb.
-For sea food, White Fish, Sweet Shrimp with Head On and Clams are all fresh and high-valued options.

And the most important: they have very good service!"}
{"text":"I'm soooo so thankful for authentic hotpot in town. THANK YOU SHABU! The lemongrass broth is a MUST. 

I love spicy food, but the \"Spicy\" broth was nose-running, taste-blocking hot, even after my friend and I fished out all of the chili peppers. Shabu Fondue if you're listening, tone it down bigtime so I can enjoy!"}
{"text":"Shabu Shabu is tough to find, but ever since I was introduced to it on a business trip in Japan years ago I've sought it out.

This place delivers with a great experience. Be sure to order a variety of meats, veggies, mushrooms, and noodles, so you can experience a variety of flavors. 

Finally, like fondu, Shabu is a group experience, so don't go alone!"}
{"text":"Eh, was not impressed. I was super excited to try this place, but it was just OK. Nothing exceptional just OK. Broth wasn't anything special I was hoping for more Japanese based broth options but all they had was miso. If you are looking for good Shabu shabu keep looking"}
{"text":"Another night out with friends, turned out to be pretty cool.  As usual, don't judge a book by its cover!

When you first try to find the place, its a lil tough.  The sign is SO small, you aren't quite sure if you are in the right place.  But, when first greeted at the door, we were asked which restaurant we were there for, and we said SHABU!

Being my wife and I had never been to a place like this before, it was a new experience.  Sitting down at a booth with an electric hot plate built into it?  So cool!  Granted, its kinda the point of the place.

We enjoyed picking through the menu, selecting various meats and vegetables to cook.  Based on the the suggestions of the staff, we chose two of the broth options as well.

Once everything was brought, the staff was great to suggest how long to cook the specific items, as to have the best results.  This was very helpful!  All of the flavors came out fantastic!!

We will most likely go back again, just to try out some more combinations!"}
{"text":"Fun place to go with friends.  Different.  Not a big Hot Pot expert but I thought the food was great.  We followed the tip of Coconut Curry and Lemongrass and they were both excellent although lemongrass was better.  We chose Lamb and Steak can't miss with those two.  
I suggest following the servers directions on how to cook.  We tried our own way and wish we had listened."}
{"text":"This concept is so much fun. The price is great, the staff friendly I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"The service was horrible!  Forever between courses, no wait staff was ever around.  Our waiter actually turned off the burner as he served our main course.  We could not cook our meal!!!  Then we couldn't find anyone to turn the dang thing on.  It took 15 minutes for someone to appear where we could flag them down.  It was a Wednesday night and only 5 tables had customers, so no excuses there.  It was horrible.

My shrimp was freezer burned!  The broth was flavorless.  The dipping sauces are very strong, no mild choices. 

Did they offer free dessert for screwing up our meal, no, nothing but \"here's your overpriced check\".

Melting Pot is worth the extra money!"}
{"text":"Don't let the strip mall location throw you off, this place is great! It has an upbeat modern Japanese vibe and the staff is super friendly. It can be a bit confusing at first for a novice hot pot goer so I would definitely suggest having a server walk you through the the menu/process. After some suggestion from our server, we had the yin yang pot with spicy lemongrass and coconut curry (favorite) broths, organic shabu beef,  shrimp, and a variety of vegetables with udon noodles. Everything was super fresh, the flavors were fantastic and it's a really fun experience overall. Such a great addition to Phoenix and the uptown neighborhood, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The first authentic hot pot place I've been to since traveling to China. Knowledgable servers with great recommendations!"}
{"text":"We will definitely be back! We had the curry coconut broth with pork, lamb, beef, taro and bamboo. We need to try the others."}
{"text":"Shabu Fondue is one of my favorite places to eat. We have 2 very picky daughters who are not super adventurous when it comes to food, so finding a place that we all love is always a good thing. The yin and yang (2 broth choices) is perfect for us, since we like spicy and they don't. We can put whatever we want in our side, and they can put whatever they want in their side. They love being able to cook the food in their broth, and it keeps them busy through the whole meal (ideal for an overall pleasant dining experience with young kids). 

I've seen some other reviews that mention bad service, so I'm going to comment on the service as well. We have not experienced bad service here yet, and I find the servers to be extremely helpful with the menu items when I'm not sure what to order. We also tend to go a little earlier before the place gets busy, so that could also be a contributor to the good service we've had. 

All in all, after dining here twice now and having a consistently good experience, this is my new favorite restaurant. I will be back a lot."}
{"text":"Really wonderful, with plenty of healthy and delicious options.  They have all nine of their broth choices in both pork-based and vegetarian options.  We had the half and half with the spicy lemongrass and the chinese herbal (not spicy), both with the pork base.  We enjoyed the New York Strip, Lamb, Korean Pumpkin, and Chrysenthenum leaves.  The meat, seafood, veggies and tofu are all delicious.  The best part?  They have chrysenthenum leaves!  Nobody has those out here.  Also, taro, watercress, and five different kinds of mushrooms.  A great place to be festive and linger over dinner with a friend or a date while staying healthy!"}
{"text":"I like this place alot great costumer service and the prices are normal this is not cheap food so expect your bill to be over 100 for 2 people which is great.  We were able to take our hot pot food to go since we order alot and were full, i love that because i hate waisting food. This will be our spot !"}
{"text":"Both times I have visited Shabu I left full and happy. This hot pot idea is great for groups as everyone can sample and share their way through the menu. Last time we ordered the ying yang pot (choice of 2 broths) with the lemon grass and house spicy. I loved the lemongrass but they were not joking around with the red chilies in the house spicy. Some of my favorite things to throw in the pot:

Baby bok choy
Dumplings
Oyster mushrooms
Oval noodles
Shabu beef
Scallops

The service has always been fast and friendly with the server filling up our broth consistently throughout the night. The interior is typical cool Johnny Chu with anime running in the backgound on the other side. Stop in and give this place a try. The unique concept shouldn't be missed!"}
{"text":"Tonight was the soft opening. Great selection and fresh! Good choice of broths and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Yeah, I'm not so sold on the concept. We worked really hard and left hungry. I'm not sure that is their fault! Also, the full bar is next door and the offerings aren't as plentiful on the fondue side. It's a novelty place like Melting Pot but really pretty reasonably priced. I just can't see myself going again."}
{"text":"Wonderful dining experience, I highly recommend if you are wanting to par take in your meal prep!! They bring the many ingredients directly to your table for you to soak in the steaming broth of your selection. It's adjacent to The Red Thia which I frequent on \"take out\" Thia food & equally as good as Shabu (completely different cuisine) hands down, some of the best Thia in the area.  You will not be disappointed in either restaurant ...."}
{"text":"Food was amazing, staff was attentive, the owner came by twice. Atmosphere is modern and sheek. My fiance' and I were really impressed."}
{"text":"So fun for kids! Our kids enjoyed cooking their own food. Everything turned out so good and it was easy for a fast and fun meal. 
We had the shabu steak, fried tofu(my favorite), rice noodles, broccoli and napa cabbage. Portions were good sizes. 

We did the duo of two broths one spicy and the other miso for the kids. I would totally recommend this for any group or any family events --we will surely be back!"}
{"text":"It was was my 13 year old grandson's birthday and this where he selected to celebrate. So there were 6 of us and it was wonderful. Everyone chose and we all shared, The service was perfect and very helpful for us first timers. We did two split hot pots and there was nothing left. The choices will appease all tastes. We will be back and are spreading the word among our friends and family."}
{"text":"Finally! Found our hot pot place... Get it... Get it...woot woot. Reminded me of all the wonderful monthly hot pot fun we had back home in Chi town at my bff china dolls house (sad face)...ah fun times..fun times. Ok,on to the food. This go round we went with the fish balls, cuttlefish balls, shrimp balls, pork dumplings, Japanese fish cakes, fried tofu, bok choy, enoki mushrooms and udon noodles. It was amaze balls (pun intended). I like to make my own dipping sauce of hoisin and sriracha (ask if you can have a side of both) then you mix them together and you get the balance of sweet and spicy/tangy.Then use it to dip your meats and veggies in. Try it you won't regret it. Everything was delish, fresh and prices were reasonable (even though they actually cut the fish balls in half). If you go go with a group, hot pot is definitely a fun time to enjoy with friends/family. We will definitely be returning to get our hot pot on."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's a unique interactive dining experience. The servers are very cognizant of first timers and walk you through their recommendations and how to select your meal. For example, our last meal, we selected the lemongrass broth and the miso broth. It's served in a sectioned pot. You then select all the items you want to cook in the pot. I recommend the chrysanthemum leaves, the acorn pumpkin, all the mushrooms, and the fried tofu.  As far as the meats, it's been awhile, but I recall the pork belly being my favorite. The server brings out the dishes and goes over the cook time for each item. And then you cook, eat, and enjoy!

I like this place because it's also vegetarian and vegan friendly. The martinis can be a little strong but I like them a lot. The best one is either the mango or the Buddha.

Don't be afraid to ask for more broth either!"}
{"text":"Shabu shabu is a favorite of mine and this is an interesting take on it.  The restaurant is a sister restaurant of a pretty intense asian bar/restaurant next door with huge anime projections on the wall and a club soundtrack.  It is a little more subdued next door but it still has a lounge atmosphere that is very different then most places where i go to stuff my face with meats.  

The idea here is that you customize your broth and have a number of choices.  We tried the ma la (sichuan peppercorn) broth and a mild japanese miso alternative.  Just go with the spicy one - it really adds flavor and does not overwhelm the meat.  Tried an assortment of beef and lamb with some veggies and potstickers on the side.  I have always had beef when doing shabu so it was nice to see some alternatives.  The lamb was actually far more flavorful than beef and retained a little extra flavor - definitely recommend it (also slightly cheaper).  

Service was friendly but big negative was that halfway through our meal we were informed the kitchen was closing even though it was only about 9:30 on a Saturday (advertised as being upon until 10:00).  That did stop me getting a third order of lamb though."}
{"text":"Our favorite place to go no matter how hot it is outside. We always get the ying yang broth with the Korean kimchi and mala spicy broth. I love mixing both in my soup bowl. The mala spicy broth is excellent to cook the meats in. Definitely a place to try!"}
{"text":"I'm always looking for something new to try and with the help of Yelp, I found this as the perfect place to have my birthday dinner at.  We were a party of 8 between family and friends.  We found it confusing at first trying to find this place.  Turns out it is housed in the same building as Red Thai and Shabu Fondue has its own door immediately behind the main entrance.  My understanding is that both restaurants are owned by the same owners.

We were all newbies at the hot pot and our server was patient in explaining the process start to finish.  I won't go into great detail here because it's pretty in depth but they explain the broths, cooking times of the meats and veggies, how to cook, etc.

We did 2 yin and yang pots with each pot holding 2 different broths.  We got the Chinese herbal and Japanese miso in one and the tomato chili and coconut curry in another.  All broths were well-liked and the spicy broths (tomato chili and coconut curry) we found to be not spicy at all.  My sister ended up asking for chili paste to make hers spicier.  The ingredients we chose were all fresh and incredibly delicious.

I felt the service could've been better.  The servers were polite but we had to ask multiple times for extra napkins and forks for the children.  Our table was cleared of empty dishes early on once.  As we had a lot more empty dishes piling up, the staff never cleared it.  Just a small pet peeve of mine while dining out, having empty/dirty dishes on the table for a long time.

Our party of 8 had an automatic 20% gratuity added to the check and although the service overall was good, it wasn't a \"20% gratuity good\".  The bill will get high as you want more diversity in your ingredients. It's not a cheap place for a meal but it was a great experience.  I would love to come back here to try out some more combinations."}
{"text":"I was a bit disappointed in the experience as a whole.  The food was meh, desert was pretty good, but way overpriced for what we got and not made for a big guy.  I've done fondue and been well full and satisfied, just not this time and not for what we spent.  Had the bread, vegetable cheese appetizer and the chicken, shrimp, and steak main.  Sauces were excellent, broth was meh again.  Desert is kinda hard to screw up but the chocolate was oily and clumpy, didn't melt well.  The scenery was excellent and decor is what a modern restaurant should be. I won't be back but try it yourself."}
{"text":"I am new to the whole hot pot thing  I LOVE IT.  Way better then a regular fondue place.  I like those too.  We had pork belly, steak and shrimp.  All were great but the pork belly was the stand out.  We are already talking about our next visit."}
{"text":"We used to live in California so we had better but this place has potential. We went there Saturday night. It wasn't pack but they took forever to bring out the spicy lemongrass broth, which wasn't flavorful so we only ate the meats, veggies and noodle. They also brought out 2 wrong veggies. We didn't complaint because it would've taken longer to eat. I thought it was a little pricey. It's not $15 - $20 per person as stated in the New Times article, more like $25 - $30 per person."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I went with my husband who loves to try new things and he had a huge smile on his face the entire time. The staff was friendly and helpful to us first-timers. The broths (we tried 2) were delicious. We had the lemongrass and curry vegetarian based broths. We ordered a bunch of meats, veggies, tofu and some noodles. We will definitely be back!!! Would be a fun place for a large group of people too!!"}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite place for hotpot, but it was a complete disappointment when I bring my family here. We called ahead to see if we can reserve table for 6 but was told no reservation over the phone. We came at the restaurant and were told it is going to be a 30 mins wait. While waiting, we noticed there were empty tables in the middle and one on the left side that could sit 6 people comfortably. We rechecked with the staffs multiple times if we could go sit at either of those tables but were told they are still not ready yet. After 40 mins waiting at the door, we finally got sit down at the table and the only things they did for this table during that \"40 min prepare time\" were sauces and water. I still do not understand the need for us to stand at the door for 40 mins when there are tables clean and ready for us. 

To top it off as if the experience wasn't bad already, we found a long blonde strain of hair in our noodle. When noticing the staff, they did bring us another plate of noodle for no charge. That still did not change the fact that there was someone hair in our pot."}
{"text":"My first and definitely won't be my last time!!! What a great experience!!! Food was amazing!!! I can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"We did the Yin/yang of Japanese miso broth and coconut curry broth.  We orders the Shabu beef, chicken (for the kids), lamb, book Chou, napa cabbage and spinach, lastly udon noodles.  The portions were larger than expected and the broth was very flavorful.  Overall we were pleasant surprised by this place and would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Food is good. But pricey (more expensive than California shabu places) and bad service."}
{"text":"This was a really fun experience. There's not exactly a plethora of options for Shabu Shabu in Phoenix, so all things considered this was a really nice dining experience. If they had sukiyaki broth as an option, I'd be a regular customer even though they are on the opposite side of town from where I live."}
{"text":"Phoenix finally has shabu. Kudos for that. As someone who has been to many shabu restaurants in other states, perhaps my expectations were too high. The food is good for the average diner but not fantastic.  I do like the option of organic grass feed beef, and choice of rice or noodles or both. Except the rice was really dry. 

The staff kept forgetting our veggies, rice, noodles, etc. Perhaps the menu was too complicated or too many options for them to handle. Instead, maybe have less options...maybe combine veggie options. The staff needs to work on a rhythm. It's not hard to bring out broth, veggies, carbs and protein. In that order. Bam, done. Once they get that down, service should improve. 

I think Shabu Fondue has potential. Those who have never had shabu should definitely try it. Being able to make a reservation was a plus."}
{"text":"Not a bad place. Kinda hard to find because of the small logo outside, u really hv to look to see it. Prices are ok cheaper than California for sure and overall nice place if u want some hot pot"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in the area. I go here every chance I get. The atmosphere is fun, and the servers are all helpful when you don't know what to order. EVERYTHING is delicious and it is so fun to cook your own food! Would recommend"}
{"text":"1.Coconut curry broth - watered down, needs more coconut milk less water

2. Tofu pieces - overpriced

3. Thai iced tea - watered down and $5?!

4. Beef, pork bellies, seafood, and vegetables - good and fresh

5. Service - great

6. Music - too loud 

7. Decor - good"}
{"text":"The food here is a 4 star but factoring in the price and customer service it drops it down a whole star... 

Recommend, kobe beef, fried/soft tofu, nappa, regular beef, shiitake mushroom, and clams. 

Broth: house special and the coconut one

Avoid: mussels, shrimp, and clams

Service took for ever because of poor staffing

It is way over priced, I was eating with 4 other people and we split the check, the total came out to be 42$ a person.."}
{"text":"After going to Shabu Fondue's former Chandler location several times, it took me awhile to make it to their new location. I finally did a couple weeks ago and must say, it was good, but not as good as I remember it being in Chandler. I went with Amy H and we got the yin yang bowl with the lemongrass spicy broth on one side and the classic spicy broth on the other. The lemongrass was tasty, but the other was somewhat bland and not that spicy. We ordered noodles, fried tofu, enoki mushrooms, beef, dumplings, and pumpkin. The best item, by far, were the dumplings... they absorbed the flavor of the broth well resulting in a great bite. The beef was my least favorite.... it just didn't soak up the flavor well in my opinion and tasted like plain beef. The peanut sauce they gave us saved it at least. The rest of the items were alright, nothing terribly special. I felt that for the price, the food just wasn't that great; however, it may be better with a bigger party (less expensive and more variety). Would I go back? Yes, most likely, but with a bigger group next time. 

PS the pea shoots weren't on the menu when we came, those were the best!"}
{"text":"I finally got to try Shabu fondue out and I was left underwhelmed. For starters the entrance is super confusing. It connects to Red Thai, but there is no hostess, sign or any instruction how to check in. The decor seemed like it was an after thought and not nearly as funky or lively as red thai.
Our server started off kind of bi**hy but got nicer as she dropped the check, how convenient. 
They give you general cook times for each item, but after hearing 7-8 different times, and not given a timer or any cheat sheet on times. It got very confusing. The Kobe beef was fatty, the lamb was good. Overall it was so/so. Being our first time having any sort of guidance or suggestions on what to order would of been helpful. It has potential and it's a fun concept. Just falls short."}
{"text":"Went to shabu last night for my first time and the food was amazing!! I loved the two broths we got and definitely was full after. The only reason I'm giving this place 4 stars was because of the service. Such a shame since this place is so yummy!"}
{"text":"To start I will say that at the door it is unclear what is what. Like you can't be sure who works where and what's the process. A girl did come up to us and said ok I will set this up for you and then come get you. So we sat down and the guy was really very personable and helpful. We made our selections it can our timely and it was tasty. The only thing we did not enjoy were the straw mushrooms. We had drinks that were kinda like meh not very tasty for the price of them. We definitely enjoyed it though I did not take pics cause let's face it how many pics of the same thing does one person need. We averaged 25 bucks per person any everyone had drinks two of us had 2 drinks so not so terrible."}
{"text":"SO great once you are in.  It's unclear when you enter what you are supposed to do since there are two restaurant entrances in one.  It would be helpful to have the hostess station in the 'lobby'.  We waited about ten minutes before anyone asked us what we needed which was a table in Shabu.  But once in, SOOOO good!  Own it if you are first time customers and they will guide you through the ordering process. We've been missing 'hot pot' ever since a visit to China figuring we'd never find it in the US.. this is pretty darn close!  Got the spicy broth and the coconut curry (Split pot) Thought the coconut curry could have been a bit tastier, but added some miso and soy sauce and it was good.  Fried Tofu was great. Looking forward to going back.  REALLY good!"}
{"text":"I've done the Shabu Fondue more times than I can count!  Usually, I order a cheese fondu for myself, and my main man gets a Shabu dish.  They both apply the same concepts... dip something fresh into something very hot and cook it yourself with long sticks.  Mm!  I've tried all the cheese fondues, and the Swiss is my favorite.  That smell is unforgettable.  I've tried all the Shabu sauces too, and they're all pretty strong, so they season those boring vegetables right up.  The cocktail menu should not be over-looked.  The caramel apple martini is the best!!!  Now the chocolate fondue....  Oh it's so good!  They serve it with marshmallows, fruit and even a slice of cheesecake to dip in!  For a very small price, you can also add a shot of liquor.  (I personally always add a shot of Bailey's to add some flavor.)  This is a PERFECT date restaurant, and it's not bad for groups either.  The dcor is pretty rad too.  The portions are healthy, but it only works if you end the dinner with the chocolate..."}
{"text":"Shabu Fondue is the best Shabu Shabu place in AZ. They have wide selections of meats, vegetables and tofu/mushroom dishes to choose from. I was very impressed with quality of meats, very tender and flavorful cuts. 

They have wide selections of broths too, both spicy and non spicy. Can't decide? Choose yin yang option and choose two which is what we decided to do. The broth has enough seasonings so no need for dipping sauces but they provide two on the table just in case.

The portion sizes are spot on too, enough to share but not too big to be limiting. The veggie dishes are decent sizes too. Since I'm a veggie lover, I wanted to order 2 of few veggie dishes but our waiter suggested starting with one. I'm glad he did because one was just perfect. 

The wait staff was excellent. They came by often to check on us and to refill the broth and waters. They also swung by to adjust the heat level too without being interruptive. 

Can't wait to go back and trying other broths and the Thai place next door."}
{"text":"Wow. Just wow. This place was so so good, not to mention fun. Shabu shabu itself means \"swish swish\" which is exactly what you do, swish your food around in tasty broth, let is simmer and get all delicious and stuff. Our waiter was extremely helpful in helping us decide how much food to actually order and what goes well with our chosen broths (the house and a spicy one). The Waygu beef is totally worth it, we ended up ordering a second round. We also had dumplings, shrimp (head off, thankfully), an assortment of veggies and tofu. The chrysanthemum was a surprisingly delicious addition. 

The atmosphere is really cool. It's a smaller restaurant, sharing its doors with Red Thai, but service is top notch. They have beer, wine, and sake OR you can order from the full bar next door. We had a delicious sake, served cold, that complimented the meal well. I really can't wait to come back, I am already planning who to take. 

OH, don't forget to order some noodles too so after you finish off the other goodies, you can add them and you got some delicious soup! We went with udon, because I insisted. Even though I was super full from our Shabu adventure, I still went for the post-meal soup."}
{"text":"Fun place, great servers and good food!! Second time I have enjoyed Hot Pot Fondue at Shabu. Pick a tasty broth, then pick your types of meats, vegs. And other things. Cook your own meat in the incredible tasting broth and have fun! I will be back every time I'm in Arizona!!"}
{"text":"Thank you Chef Johnny Chu for bringing this exciting cuisine to the Valley.

Walking in, the decor was modern, simple and clean. I definitely felt at peace, comfortable and ready to get down!

Things to know:
You will cook your own food (which totally part of the experience and fun!)
Try a little of everything, so that you can figure out your likes and dislikes.

How to:
Pick your broth (We got the split pot). 
Choose your protein(s), vegetable(s), and carbohydrate(s).  
Don't be afraid, and ask questions.
Make a little soup, or enjoy items separately.

Recommendations:
The House Broth, so flavorful and layered. 
Watercress, Fish Balls (or Shrimp Puffs). Just trust me.
Ask about spice levels. Really, I thought I was tough.

Overall you're going to spend a little money, but think of it as a meal with a side of entertainment. Also, you're going to be taking your time.

Definitely fun for groups, but intimate enough for a night out or a date.

I'll be back! :)"}
{"text":"Fun and tasty place! It's in a strip mall, but don't let that throw you off. Mmmm spicy lemongrass!"}
{"text":"Lemongrass broth is amazing! We ended up ordering way too many vegetable sides and didn't end up using. That or we just weren't that hungry! Amazing food definitely coming back. We went with one chicken, one meat, dumplings, 2 broccoli sides, bok choi , cabbage, corn, 2 noodles. It was quite a bit but now I know for next time. Would much rather have grilled dumplings than a messy mush of dumplings in broth"}
{"text":"Heard alot of positive things about this place so I did not want to go with too high of expectations. 

We decided to do the double soup base and choose the mild ones with miso and chicken broth. We ordered the shabu beef, bok choy, shrimp, egg noodles, mushrooms and for dessert had the Beignets.  Yes Beignets. 

Had a group of 5 so it was interactive for all of us to cook and prepare the dinner and enjoyed the time with each other and trying something you do not come across very often. 

We ordered at first and then ordered a little bit more later which was very good and allowed us to see if we would need more food or had enough. 

The restaurant was busy and all the tables were taken. Was interesting that 90% of the people who were dining were asian.

The restaurant shares the same entrance with Red Thai and there really is no signage for Shabu Fondue but people know it is there.

Very fun little restaurant and nice place to celebrate an occasion. A little on the pricy side but a good time for all."}
{"text":"******************* OUT OF BUSINESS! ******************* 

We wanted to go recently, and it was totally gone!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to find Shabu in the Valley after experiencing it in Boston and San Francisco! Unfortunately, this experience fell short of my expectations. It seemed to lack quality in the ingredients, although maybe the cheaper price was a reflection of that? I'm bummed because I'd been raving of Shabu for years to my husband, although he did enjoy it himself. I may give it another try in the future..."}
{"text":"Really fun dinner with friends or family. It's interactive and you cook on the tabletop. The broths are delicious and all the meats and veggies are super fresh. Definitely worth a try!"}
