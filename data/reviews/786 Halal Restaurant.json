{"text":"Had tandoori chicken, beef kababs. Awesome food. Surprisingly they had \"Pakola\" people from Karachi would understand this :)"}
{"text":"Came here last night to pick up some dinner.  The beef qeema and haleem is absolutely delicious!  Pair them with rice or plain naan to soak up the ghee.  Yum!  Minus one star for the long delivery time - called at 7 pm and was told the earliest delivery would be for 9 pm!"}
{"text":"I had lamb karahi and it was really good. Well done, not too spicy and mint not too overpowering. Biryani rice on the side was good too and so was plain yogurt. The portions are very generous and this could have been a shared meal. I'm so full now that I am having mint tea to help the digestion. Service was very good too. Very attentive."}
{"text":"I went there with a friend, hoping to try some traditional biriyani. I had been craving for biriyani for awhile and convinced a friend to join me.   I ordered the Chicken Biriyani with some sides. I have rarely been this disappointed with biriyani, as much I was with this restaurants version of biriyani. The rice is so dry that it will basically get stuck in your throat. The spices are jumbled up, either too much or too little on certain parts. The sides were not helping. Also, the amount of salt, dear god.   I had heard good things about this place, but i guess that's all in the past."}
{"text":"Not a fan--I've had better desi food elsewhere. The food here was pretty tasteless for the most part, and the service wasn't that great."}
{"text":"Great Indian/Pakistani food . Very tasteful and you get to choose from a variety of options . Their Tandoori Checkin is amazing . Very reasonable price . Actually very cheap compared to downtown . One of if not the best Indian restaurant in Montreal"}
{"text":"Their best dishes -to me- were the Chicken Tikka boneless and the Chicken biryani. I prefer their versions of these dishes to any indian/paki restaurant -expensive or cheap- in Montreal.  The Friday special Nahari is pretty good, too.  I tried most of their other dishes. It's a hit and miss. Some are good and some aren't worth ordering. Unfortunately, it's a matter of taste so your on your own. Their Lassi wasn't good.  Service is average and seating is pretty plain. Their prices are a bit overpriced for Pakistani food, I think.  Be sure to ask about their daily specials."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery. VERY VERY greasy. Also the cheese in the palak paneer was bad. I mean like it had turned bad. The chicken in the tikka korma was also full or cartilage and bad. I threw both of them out after a few bits. The sauces had a whole layer of grease on top and even though I was hungry it was just gross. Even the rice wasnt good. The person who took my order on the phone was very nice tho. Im not sure how they got such great ratings. Im convinced someone there is paying people to give them out.   Final call:  I wouldnt eat here unless you want food poisoning"}
{"text":"I think they changed chef cause I certainly can say that the food doesn't taste as good as before... 2-3 years ago the food was the best in Montreal... But recently we went and it wasn't that great..."}
{"text":"GREAT FOOD... coming from someone with very picky taste when it comes to Pakistani food, this place is definitely one of the best: not only on gerrard, but in the GTA!!   They have a good naan and great kebabs and tandoori chicken! The butter chicken doesn't taste like your typical, but definitely good..."}
{"text":"Fresh and taste food chicken chargah was very delicious. I would come back again service was also very good."}
{"text":"The food is okay but some of the worst customer service I have ever received. Do not recommend at all."}
{"text":"OMG, this restaurant has arguably the best Pakistani and Indian food between the down town core and the West Island.  Different from other South Asian restaurants, this one doesn't drench it's food in oil.   I recommend the beef kababs and the palak paneer, along with the beriani. However, all the dishes are worth a try.  Service is very good here too. A clean and comfortable place. Newly renovated."}
{"text":"Delicious, authentic Pakistani food. Lamb karahi was incredibly flavourful, balanced well with a mint yogurt - highly recommended. Palak paneer was delicious, and light. Chicken tikka marsala as good as any you'll ever have. Star of the meal was the whole fried tilapia- cooked beautifully, tender, crispy skin, seasoned wonderfully with a mix of spices. Sufficient naan bread is a must.  Would recommend having the dishes spicy. We ordered ours at medium spice, which although fantastic, could have definitely used an extra kick."}
{"text":"Pretty decent food. I'd say the food is 3 stars, but the best thing about this place is that they deliver, and their delivery person takes cards. They take quite awhile to deliver but we know this and plan accordingly.  So the fourth star is for delivering painlessly. I find their food to be a bit hit or miss, we had a great chickpea dish, delicious rice, pretty good naan, yummy lamb jalfrizi and a meh lentil dish that will sit in our fridge for now.  But again, we love delivery from them. Always super pleasant."}
{"text":"Great Lamb Karahi !!! It is one of their signature dish. Their naan is also very soft and delicious. I keep coming back for the lamb karahi and Seek kebab. Great & friendly service as well."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere, separate area for families or couples who don't want to be overwhelmed with all the testosterone( i.e. lots of males) in the larger area (not that that's an issue for everybody). The food comes relatively quick. The barbecue items take a bit longer (fresh takes longer). Waiters are polite and helpful. Free water refills without having to ask (waiter walks around refilling everyones glass).  Food is reasonably priced. We had veal kadhai, chicken biryani, seekh kabobs and naan. All were delicious. Especially the veal kadhai. The kabobs left a little to be desired as they didn't have authentic pakistani taste, tasted more middle eastern sausage type. However they were still decent. Naans were fabulous. Hours are awesome! Open late, like very late!"}
{"text":"Food was so testy try full B.B.Q chicken rest of food is good too I would recommend this place to every one will be back ...."}
{"text":"I had not gone here in at least 5 years, I remember the only decent thing being Lahori Fish. I also remember the waiter the last time telling us the Butter Chicken was not good and to go to an Indian restaurant if we wanted that.  I went with 2 Pakistani friends, a little apprehensive since I've lived over 25 years and Parc Extension and I know Greek and South Asian spots here like the back of my hand.  My friend assured me it was great the last time he went, so off we went.  This used to be a Greek restaurant a while back and they kept the nautical decor, What bugs me every time is we are not allowed near the window, it's practically segregated for families only (ie. women and children) and man stay closer to the kitchen.  The food was just bland and not fresh, every dish disappointed, the chicken karahi was full of bones and the sauce separated from the oil (re-heated).  The lamb byriani was also underwhelming with the meat chunks dry and chewy.  A lentil dish was practically untouched, the naan with raita was quite good. The waiter just shrugged  when we told him the best thing was the bread.  About 50 bucks for 3 dishes and 6 naan's (we were starving and it was the only good thing). The prices are a bit higher than elsewhere (they are hidden away on the second floor, there for many years so their rent must be cheaper)."}
{"text":"Définitivement le meilleur restaurant pakistanais/indien que j'aie jamais visité. Tout est frais et vibrant de couleur et de saveur! Mes meilleures découvertes par ordre de wow: le poisson entier, le poulet entier et le lamb karahi. OMG! Le naan est aussi plein de saveur, ainsi que leur sauce à la menthe. En accompagnement, un bon deal serait de prendre le chicken rice biryani, un riz frit aux morceaux de poulet, et un lassi, superbe smoothie yogourt et mangue. La salle n'est pas époustouflante, mais la bouffe est tellement bonne et le service est tellement courtois (à chaque fois que j'y vais, tous les serveurs sont super) que peu importe le décor de la salle, qui est d'ailleurs très propre. Love it!!!!"}
{"text":"This will be my 2nd outing to this restaurant. I was really excited for my family to try the food since I enjoyed every single dish thoroughly the last time.   Unfortunately, this time I was disappointed. I got my family too hyped up about the food.   The restaurant wasn't busy at all, but the service was super slow. Our orders were taken by two different waiters. So it was annoying, but both them were amiable, so I cannot be super angry at them.   We ordered almost a buffet on our table. Mango lassi, Pakota (Pakistani cream soda(too sweet)), Chana Masala (chickpeas curry), mutter paneer (peas/cheese), butter chicken, Biryani Rice, grilled tilapia, and naan bread. The only meals that were good, were grilled tilapia and Chana Masala. Butter chicken was cold, so we asked them to warm it again. Mutter paneer were over cooked, tasted super bland; which we notified and we just got a sorry. Naans were super dry. In the end, what made us happy was Masala Chai with nice warm gulab jamun.   In the end, when we asked for our bill; our waiter kept telling us that our bill isn't ready(language barrier?, how can you not make bill ready); we waited for our bill about 20 minutes. I felt leaving the place right way.   My first experience was so good, but my second experience is completely the opposite, and I don't think I want to come back for a third experience."}
{"text":"My friend, an elite Yelp member took me to her favorite place. The location has been changed; it's on 850 Jean Talon street.   Very spacious place. We are seated by window. Table settings are very neat; I love the combination of white and forest green. Since it's my friend's favorite restaurant; I asked her to the order, and we shared the food.  The service is very nice; and super quick.   We ordered Lamb Karai, which was so delicious. The blend of spices was perfect. Lamb was cooked to the \"T\", and chopped coriander as garnish was the cherry on top. With Lamb, we also had Naan and chicken biryani. Naan, was too perfect. It wasn't not burnt; it was round and fluffy. Chicken biryani was really good too, with the mint sauce. For desert, I got my favorite Ras Malai with Chai. It was really refreshing.   The prices are very reasonable.   I highly recommended this amazing Pakistani restaurant."}
{"text":"Had dinner with friends recently and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The food was fresh, tasty and the service excellent. I had the Lamb Qorma along with the biryani rice & garlic naan. Also, the price made this well worth it.  I look forward to going back again."}
{"text":"Délicieux et pas chère. Serveurs agréables ce que je n'ai pas aimé c la salle mais bon on ne peut pas tout avoir."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots to get some Pakistani food. I have been going to this restaurant for a good 10 years and it never disappoints. The food is always great. I recommend the biryani, channa masala and lamb korma. Pretty much everything on the menu is good. Their mango lassi is great as well. The restaurant just expanded and there is much more space. I never had any issue with the service. The waiters have always been kind and attentive."}
{"text":"My friends have always been ordering delivery from this place, so I decided to join in with them yesterday.  When we called, we were told that the drvier wasn't available for another hour..so we expected slow delivery. It arrived in about 1 hour and 15 mins. Not bad. (Plus our location was DT and these guys are in East York)  We ordered:  1. Peshavari Chapli Kabob - It was great, a tad dry though. It came with rice, salad and naan.  2. Lahori Chargha (Full) - AKA A full tandoori chicken. It was amazing. This chicken was clearly marinated for days. Too bad it wasn't as spicy as the stuff is supposed to be..Still amazing though. Colour me Chargha?  3.Achari Lamb - So good. The lamb was amazing. The gravy was thick and greasy and delicious.   4. Naans. Naans were amazing. AMAZING.  We will definitely be ordering from here again!   14/15"}
{"text":"Decent food.  The naan was not fluffy but more like a pan fried Chinese dough pancake, crisp outside and chewy inside.  Not bad but not the naan I like.  The whole Bbq chicken tasted salty and was all, no other flavor.  I think a provigo roast chicken would have been juicier and tastier. Butter chicken wasn't buttery tasting.   The eggplant dish was good, with a full taste and nice texture, but that was the only thing I liked on the table. The spinach and paneer dish was ok.  Service was very friendly though."}
{"text":"Karahi chicken was pretty good! Chapli kabab, chicken tikka, cholay, mango lassi were all decent. Service was very fast!"}
{"text":"The best Pakistani restaurant I've been to in Montreal. This place has a meh-ish nautical décor. The Chicken Biryani here is textbook perfect. Chicken marinated in yogurt and spices, topped with half cooked rice and cooked for hours on a mild flame. The meat is super tender and moist not to mention full of flavor and the rice has a nice aroma.  They make it everyday except Saturdays. Saturday they make lamb biryani, though I'm a fan of their chicken biryani. Also on Thursdays they have takeout special, Biryani just for 4 bucks. The Lahori Chargah (Pakistani take on the Tandoori Chicken) is great. They also have Fish BBQ'd in Tandoori spices. Quantities are huge and you get a good bang for your buck. Definitely recommended.   Food : Good Service :Fast Ambiance : O_o Worth the price : Yes"}
{"text":"Un excellent restaurant pakistanais. La nourriture pakistanaise est similaire à l'indienne donc on retrouve du poulet au beurre et autres délices. Le décor a été refait donc des belles céramiques sur le mur au lieu du décor d'ancien restaurant de fruits de mers. Le service toujours  agréable.  J'y retrouve fréquemment. Une belle découverte pour vos amis que vous voulez impressionner. Ce n'est pas la plus belle place du monde mais la nourriture vaut le détour.   La préparation peut prendre du temps mais c'est parce que c'est cuisiner avec amour!  Le pain naan est chaud, tendre et offert en différentes saveurs. Le poulet; des bons morceaux sans aucuns gras. Le riz:  savoureux.  Je conseille le poulet au beurre et le poulet tika massala.  Attention: le petit yogourt vert offert avec certains plats n'est pas du yogourt pour apaiser les goûts d'épices,,, mais encore plus d'épices! J'ai fait l'erreur,.."}
{"text":"This is the place you go for the real thing, taste. We ordered almost every thing on the menu (we were a group of 8). Chargha, seekh kebab, nihari, biryani, Chana. Every single thing was spot on with the taste. And the naan's are light and good, mango lasso and chai just completed appetite. Don't go by the look it bears from outside and inside, just follow your taste buds."}
{"text":"Horrible service and the food didn't even taste good. One of the servers actually spilled alll the food on us and our table and we got no apology or compensation. Would never go back. Don't recommend."}
{"text":"Très bon rapport qualité/prix. Restaurant pakistanais parmi plusieurs autres rue Jean Talon mais celui-ci se démarque. La cuisine y est délicieuse.  Plutôt difficile de se faire servir en français par contre mais possible.  Il est aussi possible de commander pour emporter.  J'y retournerai."}
{"text":"I always enjoy eating at this place.  Never was disappointed.  Almost every item i tried was really good.  My favorite is the biryani which I think is the best in Montreal. Will be back soon to get me more of this yimmy food."}
{"text":"Love the food here..although some other friends believe the price is quite overpriced compared to other desi locals. But most definitely the place has the best kheer in town! Highly Reccomended"}
{"text":"Most people just lump Indian food into one group and think it represents the entire subcontinent as a whole.  Folks, it's a subcontinent.   Like Europe or South America, just as there are huge regional differences in the cuisine of even smaller countries like France or Italy, there are just as wide and divergent diffrences in food from Kashmiri, Rajasthani, Goan, Punjabi, Bengali, Assamese, Keralese, Tamil, Pakistani, Lahori, Nepalese, Tibetan, Sri Lankan, Bhutanese, Old Delhi, Karachi, Marathi, and Baluchi areas reflecting the history, ethnicity and geography of these places and peoples. Perhaps restauranteurs from these countries are also partially to blame for not offering the richness of their cuisine on a wider scale when instead they just dumb down and offer the \"generic\" Indian restaurant menu, but I digress.  786 Halal Restaurant is located at 768 Jean Talon West. No, the owners and sign makers weren't dyslexic. 786 is the numerological value for the opening verses of the Koran. And Halal obviously means they serve only Halal meat here, meat which has been properly (ahem) killed, blessed and prepared, much like kosher meat in the Jewish tradition. They do not serve alcohol here since it's an establishment that likes to keep it close to it's Islamic roots, as evidenced by the donation box by the cash register for the local mosque as well as the family tables set aside near the front. Hindus are vegetarians but Muslims eat meat, so vegetarians, beware, go to Pushap instead. 786 Halal does have a pretty large vegetable menu so no worries if you do find yourself here with omnivorous  friends.  Simply put, the food here is amazing! No wonder they opened a second franchise in Toronto which apparently has line-ups around the block. Lahori food is known for it's marinated, spiced up grilled meats. (think of it as BBQ Pakistani style) and the specialty here is definitely the Lahori Deep Fried fish and BBQ Chicken.   Come here on a Friday (The Islamic holy day of the week) and you can order the Haleem, a mish mash of meat, lentils and wheat which is like a thick stew. The desserts are alright, not the best, but passable. The one dessert I do recommend is the Gajar ka halwa, which is a carrot pudding, sounds strange, but trust me, it's great!  I came here for lunch today and it was a packed house, so I ordered to go and went to a local park and enjoyed lunch out in the sun, but I'm definitely coming back when it's quieter."}
