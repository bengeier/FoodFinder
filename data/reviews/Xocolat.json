{"text":"Beautiful restaurant and the quality of the food is extremely high. It was not traditional Mexican fare, but Mexican flavours and ingredients heightened. I really enjoyed it and will be back. The only criticism is the price point is still slightly too high for lunch, but they don't pretend to be inexpensive."}
{"text":"The cocktails and desserts were decadent and visually appealing. The main course left much to be desired. It took over an hour for our food to arrive and when it did, it was stone cold.  The open-concept kitchen has poor ventilation and as a result, the entire restaurant was filled with smoke.  Our server was professional and polite, but we found the hostesses to be unnecessarily pretentious and inappropriately dressed for an establishment that claims to be \"posh\".  We would not go back."}
{"text":"When I first heard of this up and coming restaurant I was very excited. I researched the menu and kept searching up pictures of what the food and venue would be like (more than I do usually that is!)  At last, I got the chance to go for lunch and I must say that I enjoyed my first experience, although my other lunch companions did not. I think anyone that comes into Xocolat with the idea that they are going to be served authentic Mexican cuisine might be disappointed. You have to go in with an open mind and the thought that this will be more of a fusion culinary experience.   I loved what they did with the décor, the rich splashes of colour throughout is refreshing and makes the space beautiful.  We tried a couple dishes to share which included an order of the Tacos de Canasta and Gordita. I tried the chicken taco (there was four different kinds) and a bite or two of the Gordita. I liked the taco but found the \"salsa tasting\" that came with it to be lacking. The Gordita was a bit heavy but had a nice flavour.  For my lunch I had the Langosta, which is essentially a baby arugula salad with heirloom, avocado, lobster and cilantro dressing. The presentation was very appealing and once I had that first bite.... I was in a lobster paradise. The flavours were complimentary and very delicious.  We ordered dessert and I had the Chocoflan, a very rich chocolate cake. If you are a chocoholic like me, you will enjoy this. I also tried the Margarita Diablo, which was like a tequila bellini with a kick.   One thing that I didn't like however was that you can't order any of the appetizers at lunch which is the main reason why we all decided on this venue. I still want to come back and try out the dinner menu and a couple other cocktails!"}
{"text":"Xocolat! Say it properly, like \"shuck-oh-la\". (Do NOT call it 'Chocolate')  Yes, the name is sexy, so do it justice.   I came here with two other lovely ladies to get our taco fix, and I am happy to say we were all extremely pleased! I got the Norenos, which is beef skirt steak. $16 gets you four delicious tacos. The beef was SO well seasoned, I could eat it by itself and be a happy girl. But what needs special mention is the little bowl of chilli oil on the side, to drizzle over your taco insides as you please. Its no secret I like my food spicy, but oh my damn - this chilli oil was over the top! It was so SO tasty and addictive, I almost had a fleeting panic attack when I thought I would run out of it before I ran out of tacos. Not the case, thankfully.  I need more of that chilli oil. Now. And FOREVER.   We also innocently ordered some margaritas which came in sizes as big as our heads! Holy cow, they're not messing around :)  Our waitress was adorable also, and in the end brought a box (yes, a big mirrored BOX) which contained our bill inside along with three little pumpkin brittles, complimentary.   As I am writing this review, I can't help but salivate at the thought of the tacos again. With the chilli oil. (Why am I not there right now?) Oh Xocolat, I am coming back to you, sooner than you know!"}
{"text":"I had a stop over in Denver, and decided to get tacos while waiting for my delayed plane back to Calgary, since I had been eating tacos in SoCal for 2 weeks straight and even the worst one was an excellent one.  Not so in DEN Airport. I was handed re-microwaved steamed frozen mixed vegetable medley in a soft tortilla. It was the most revolting thing I have ever had betwixt a tortilla shell. I tweeted my Taco Regrets and got this reply from Xocolat:  \"Can't wait until you get home! We got your back!!\"  I've had Xocolat on my radar ever since they took over the space of my favorite sandwich spot in town, Vue Café. I watched the restaurant slowly take shape for months, and saw them at events prior to their Grand Opening Party earlier this year. I've tweeted back and forth with them about their menu, as they promised they would have vegan and gluten-free options available. So when Wendy suggested we head that way after froyo happiness (because dessert before dinner is the best thing ever); I was in there like swimwear.  Our waitress was sweet, adorable and knew the menu like the back of her hand. When they didn't have the first Margarita option available, she knew right away what a good alternative would be. The Margarita Xocolats... oh. My. Damn. They are as delicious as they are beautiful... and enormous! Use two hands. They're also only 50¢ more than a much more sensible sized \"Margarita Clasica,\" so opt for the Xocolat. Or the Diablo! They are nomz. No cloyingly sweet margarita mix and rotgut Cuervo here. They're all made with Don Julio. Mine came with Tamarind candy! And a handpainted elephant! Love.  With our drinks came a basket of fresh tortilla chips and black bean dip. While I couldn't eat the black bean dip, because it had cheese on top, the chips were delicious and reminded me of the taquerias back home.  We all ordered tacos: Mine contained bell peppers, poblanos and mushrooms. Sabz got Norenos with Arrachera (Beef skirt steak), and I'm not sure what Wendy got... because y'all need to update your website menu, Xocolat! All the tacos were served in a soft homemade corn tortilla, with a lime wedge and the most addicting chili oil of your life. I thought King's had the best garlic chili oil in the universe, but Xocolat is giving them a run for their money. It's nothing to fuck with. While other Mexican restaurants in town will try to warn you about their bland \"hot sauce,\" Xocolat's chili oil is simple and legit. When my tacos were all in my belly, I drizzled the rest of the oil on the remaining chips. If I wasn't with company I would've tongue bathed the little bowl it came in.  We finished the meal with the Margarita Clasicas, and our bill came in a fancy box with Pumpkin Seed Brittle. Already making a mental note to come back very soon, and try the rest of the cocktails. I've got my eye on the Melon Riviera."}
{"text":"Sadly can't give it a five as my duck was quite overcooked but it was excellent in general. Interior is gorgeous, food was incredible and drink menu is both fun and tasty. Staff was less than attentive or knowledgeable but it is a new joint so we can hope that they up their game. I will be back."}
{"text":"Looking at the black chasm that is my credit card bill, I'm starting to realize how rare it is for to find the logic in going to a high end restaurant. And I'm not alone. But, this is the challenge restaurants like Xocolat rarely worry about because if you put out amazing MIND BLOWING food, you give even the most cheapskate home cook something to aspire to.  Xocolat's pricing structure is simple. Three courses for $45, Five for 75, and 7 for over 100$. It's much better and more fun, you might just feel like ordering the same place of duck braised mole sauce so you can swim in mole heaven, or you might just say \"fuck it, I don't wanna be an adult\" and have five courses of churros like a little chubby Nino.  They were awesome enough to let us try their pork empanada, something that's been brewing in their test kitchen. It was AMAZING and something future xocolat patrons would look forward too. Trust me, I consider myself an empanada expert.  We sat at the bar and the service was very warm and friendly. Our bartender served us some drinks and became elated at our request for suggested tequila. He made some pricey suggestions, but I didn't care, I needed a reminder of why Jose Cuervo is used as toilet cleaner in Mexico.  I'll end this review with huge praise over their ceviche. So refreshing yet complex in texture. I love the lime consomme. Just love it."}
{"text":"Love this place. Total chick magnet, from the purse trees to the pink accents on the cloth napkins, menus and our server's tie. Pretty, well-made cocktails, but not as strong as I would like, but then again, I never met anyone would likes their drinks as strong as I do. I only tried the soup, and it was amazing. Just a lot of complimentary textures and flavours going on. My friends ordered various appetizers, main and dessert and everything smelled and looked amazing. I'm planning on returning to try the food and give a more detailed review. Great service. Make sure you ask about the food, the menu description does not do it justice."}
{"text":"Incredible tasting menu! We worked our way through ten different dishes sharing as we went and they were all delicious. Service was fantastic, and the margarita's were better than any we have ever had in Mexico. We will be back, often."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with a friend today and was relatively pleased with the experience. We made a reservation which is usually a good idea on a Friday at lunch but we didn't need it..... We were the only people there. That made us a little uneasy wondering if there was a reason it was so slow but we couldn't find one.  We each had a cocktail and both enjoyed them. I had their version of a Caesar which had a hint of cucumber and though it was an unexpected flavour, it was delicious! We both enjoy trying a selection of things so we shared the Shrimp Ceviche, the Tiger Prawn Tacos and the Chilaquiles. My dining partner had never had ceviche so it was a new experience for her, it was delicious with the right amount of everything. The Prawn tacos were fantastic! Served with a chili oil and big pieces of prawn on corn tortillas they were our favourite dish. When the Chilaquiles arrived I was a little wary because the egg on top was definitely on the runny side and sometimes I don't love that but when it was broken and it ran over the rest of the dish it was delicious. The flavours were spot on and we finished every bite of every dish.  The only complaint that I had, and it wasn't a huge issue today, was that after we said we were done it took the server almost 15 minutes to bring us the bill. We were not pressed for time but it seemed excessively long especially since at that time there was only one other table.   All in all it was a nice meal. I would definitely like to go for dinner and see what else they have to offer."}
{"text":"A small group of friends decided to embark upon Xocolat one April evening after hearing much social media buzz about it.  I was the first to arrive and upon entering the restaurant I was immediately greeted and led to our table.    Xocolat is the new kid on the block and one of only a few restaurants in Calgary that currently offer Molecular Gastronomy.   The decor is just beautiful with hues of pinks & browns in a contemporary setting.   From our seat we could see into the kitchen and watch the Chefs if we wanted.  I was quite excited to find next to our table was a purse rack, brilliant!  The group ordered a variety of beverages, appetizers, mains and desserts to try.  I delighted in starting with a Margarita Xocolat. Part of the proceeds for this bevy go back to Mexico to help support a community there.  This drink was so enjoyable I ordered a second one.  My appetite wasn't huge this evening so I went with two appetizers and it was the right choice since I couldn't finish them.  The Queso Con Chorizo was very tasty as I love all things cheese.  Next up was the Tacos De Canasta consisting of 3 varieties; Frogs legs, chicken & mushrooms. It came with 4 salsas as well.  Every single bite was a flavour explosion in my mouth.  Seriously good stuff.  For the finale everyone went with a dessert option but I was too full and went with an after dinner drink instead called the Carajillo.  One sip and I wanted more.  I was however able to taste everyone's dessert and it was all exceptional.  In the end we were brought the Tequila Mousse to sample and it was beyond incredible. You Must Order This Dessert.  Our waiter was knowledge, delightful & fun.  Sergio & Omar stopped by our table to chat with us and we ended up hearing the story of how Xocolat came to be.  If I could give this restaurant more than 5 stars I would.    I look forward to returning here, soon."}
{"text":"Xocolat has won my heart for one of the sexiest date spots in Calgary.  Ultra low lighting, chic backlighting and a small dance floor. The late night menu features some of the best menu items, pork tacos were excellent. Taco shells are warm and soft. The Xocolat Margarita is strong with hints of sweetness but not too much. Perfect start to a dinner.  The band played while a small crowd shook their hips, the music was no where near loud enough to drown out our conversation. Big thumbs up on the details like volume of music. Desserts were amazing. My chocoflan was delicious but no where near as impressive as the Tequila Mousse dessert. Highly recommend this, but I won't give up too much details, as it is a spectacle of it's own.  Another Xocolat distinction is the habanero chocolate we received on the house. It's a kicker to the taste buds so use the words 'a little goes a long way\" caution!"}
{"text":"Is it possible to give 6 stars to a restaurant??...THIS PLACE IS JUST AWESOME!!!.. Everything was just delicious!!.. Starting with the incredible Amuse Bouche until the desserts!!.. That for me were the best part of the dinner!!.. They were incredible!!.. I had the tequila mousse and the presentation was spectacular but the taste was better!!.. My main dish was great too, and the drinks were the best I have had in a while.. Even when I am a wine person, and normally I just drink wine, I decided to try the cocktails, because they looked great, and I think was the best decision ever!!.. The margaritas are delicious!!.. I want to go back there tomorrow if possible!!.. This restaurant will be top 10 of Calgary soon!!"}
