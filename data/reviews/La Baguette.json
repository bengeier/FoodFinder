{"text":"My favorite place to grab lunch or coffee with friends! Owners are so nice and really go out of their way to make you happy. Food is delicious. All of it!
Only downside is I wish they could take cards but I understand it is a small business.. 
Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Real French pastries, real French owners, French news on the TV. The setting  is Wisconsin deli but the atmosphere and food is the real thing, made with butter (Imagine! No palm-oil and shortening cakes!) and an experienced hand. When I went for a late-afternoon box of eclairs the owners were kind, speedy and there for questions. I feel like La Baguette is a secret known only to a few...One of the best bakeries in town without all the hullabaloo of some of the downtown attitude (and prices). Keep in mind they are cash only!"}
{"text":"I went to La Baguette on my way to the airport in order to avoid having to buy airport food for lunch. I was in a hurry and asked if they had any pre-made sandwiches. The gentleman behind the register explained that they don't do pre-made sandwiches but that a fresh one wouldn't take long to make. He made a couple of suggestions and I went with the chicken sandwich. It was quickly made and SO delicious. It was on the best baguette I've had in years. I lived in France many years ago and this experience at La Baguette brought me right back to that time, so authentic. I was pleasantly surprised to find this little gem in an unassuming strip mall. I will definitely go back next time I'm in Madison!"}
{"text":"On a lazy weekend morning, it doesn't get better than La Baguette. 

The ambiance is great. It's a cozy, sunny place with friendly, often bilingual, staff.

First of all, bottomless coffee. You can linger as long as you'd like and they'll keep you caffeinated. 

Order at the counter with one of the friendly staff, but your choice will be hard. Gaze into the glass cases and choose from an assortment of generously portioned sweet and savory treats. I highly recommend the classic and simple quiche au chevre. Dotted with tasty hunks of tangy goat cheese, sprinkled with herbs, nestled in a buttery crust. It is perfect!

If you're feeling a bit more hungry, try the Croque Monsieur: thinly sliced ham between melted cheese and thick bread, coated in egg and fried. Yum.

And of course, it's hard to resist a sweet treat. My favorite is the pain au chocolat. A perfect sweet bite to have with the previously mentioned bottomless coffee. 

I haven't tried any of the absolutely beautiful galettes or other desserts or taken a loaf of the fresh baked breads, but I plan on doing so soon. It's just that every time I go to La Baguette, I leave feeling so happy and full that I can't even think about my next meal."}
{"text":"Ok, ok, I get it. La Baguette is terribly French and I'm just a rube from DeFo. But come on. $7.95 for a few sparse ingredients slapped between two halves of a baguette? Furthermore, although I have impeccable dental hygiene, I found the sandwich quite literally PAINFUL to eat. I don't believe that ANY sandwich--even a rustic, terribly French sandwich--should cause my gums to bleed. FURTHER furthermore, the proprietress' irritation at my lack of exact change was palpable.

Sigh. This was on my bucket list, but I would never go there again."}
{"text":"Love it! A fine place for a light lunch with a distinctly French touch."}
{"text":"I called to find out if they make macaron, which is a typical french desert. A man answered and just snapped, 'Hello', I wasn't sure I had called the right place, but not a good start... 
So I ask if they make macaron, the guy, who sounded French, says only if you special order. There was a little misunderstanding between us, because of his accent. I think we both got frustrated and he started acting rude. I thought he meant 10$ worth , but it was really TEN macaron. At La Baguette, one macaron is 3.50$, so that would require an order of 10 at 35$. He was rude and abrupt, then hung up on me, before even taking my order. I've never had them so I was curious, but now not so much. 

*update* 
On the following Monday-
So, I still wanted to try the macarons, but I also wanted to find out if this is how they treat their customers. I called, little did I know I was talking to the owner. I told her about the previous call and how even though I was treated rude, I was still really interested in making an order. 

She didn't seem to find it interesting that I was treated rudely the first time(considering she's the owner), and to top it of, she herself DID NOT know how many macarons I needed to make the special order. She said maybe 10 or 12. So I got frustrated and asked if she knew which one it was. She said 'Ok, maybe 12.' 
Maybe isn't definite. So I said, 'Okay, you don't know, can I speak to someone who does?' (Mind you SHE'S the OWNER, shouldn't she know??) In reply, she snaps at me, 'We don't make macaron okay? So that's it.' I couldn't believe that... first they do, now they don't. 'So now you don't make them?' 

I admit it pissed me off - w.t.heck? I'm a CUSTOMER; ie, potential return ie money giver???, and you're being rude to me instead of facilitating a transaction? So I told her to bleep herself and hung up. 

I was so upset, now I was going to go let the owner know, (cuz I still didn't know SHE was). So I get my coat on and go there ask to speak to the owner and wait. While I'm looking around, I notice they don't really have a large stock of bakery. Very few pies or bread... interesting. When a woman comes out and I heard her voice - I knew she was the person from the phone. D'oh! I told her I was the caller from earlier, that I was hoping to resolve the situation and was wrong for saying what I said. But I added that I wrote a review about how I was treated and that this would be her chance to win a customer over. She was unapologetic (which I wouldn't expect her to be at this pt.) but even accused me of being rude from the beginning. O.o Um I don't think so. Do the French think if they accuse someone else of being rude first then it means THEY weren't? 

Once I realized she didn't care about customers, it ended with me saying some not very nice things in the french I learned from school.  

Let's just say, I will NEVER, EVER go back, and don't recommend them. Proof positive to me that French ARE rude."}
{"text":"Get. The. Quiche. It is, by far, the best quiche I have ever had in my life*. I am an eastsider and, if I am on the west side, 90% of the time, I am stopping at La Baguette on my way home. It's worth going to anytime you are nearby. They have some regular flavors and they also mix it up every now and then, which I like. 

The pastries: If you want a cupcake, go to a cupcake shop. The flavors are sophisticated and (what I envision being) traditional French. These pastries aren't ruled by sugar like most American pastries tend to be. They are sugary, to be sure, but they are equally buttery, flaky, rich, and delicately textured. The flavors of the fruit, the nuts the chocolate are the features and dominant flavors. They are not overly sweet by any stretch. 

I can't say much about the rest of the menu. I've been so enamoured by the quiche and the pastries that I haven't drifted much. It's worth going to if just for those two items. I did once buy a baguette and it was perfection as well as the tomato soup which was a miss for me. 

I highly recommend you pop in to this authentic French bakery. The owners really are French (they constantly speak French mixed with English) and it is rumoured that they have a very particular french baking flour imported for their products. My tastebuds wouldn't be the least bit surprised to learn that this were true. This place truly is a rare gem in the city of Madison. 

*I haven't ever been to France. I can imagine that quiche in some areas of France may be even better than this quiche in Madison but improvement upon the perfection of this quiche is difficult to grasp. To me, it seems like utter perfection. Oh, and, they'll strongly recommend that you have it heated up. DO THIS."}
{"text":"After seeing so many excellent reviews, I was hopeful on this one.  I was sadly disappointed.  I picked up espresso and a couple of pastry tarts (chocolate and fruit) and none of these items were particularly memorable.  Espresso was burnt, both tart crusts were too thick, the pastry cream was too sweet and runny, and the fruit on the fruit tart was not of great quality.    

The food is not inedible, but if you are looking for a great French bakery in Madison--this isn't it, especially for the prices.  They are set much too high given the quality of the food.  I would pay 4.50 for an excellent pastry but not for this mediocre experience."}
{"text":"I stopped in on my way home after galavanting around capitol square for the DCFM (that's our farmer's market for the acronym-averted), looking to take home a baguette to go along with all the goodies I picked up from our local farmers. 

The two lovely women working spoke French fluently, to each other- as well as to me... and I tried my best to communicate with what little of their beautiful language I know. : )

My still-warm, perfectly crisp, light & airy baguette was delicious- and I took a regular coffee for the road too.

Merci, La Baguette 

-Victoria"}
{"text":"We were just there right at noon and were one of two tables occupied. There's a reason for that. The food is mediocre, tasteless, and the staff is rude. I had a ham and cheese crepe. It came with a salad of spring greens and pomegranate seeds. The crepe was not at all crisp and not as thin as you should expect in a good French restaurant, and it was folded into a square over the ham and cheese, rather than rolled, as is customary. But by far the worst part was that the cheese was bland mozzarella- and way too much of it - and the ham was a very thin slice of sandwich meat, unable to be tasted among so much cheese. The salad was pretty, but had next to no dressing. I'm usually fine with only olive oil on greens, but a little more would have been nice. Every culture, no matter how good the cuisine, is bound to have some bad cooks. Just because you're French does not mean you can cook. I have eaten at this restaurant four times and never had anything at all impressive or tasty- average at best. If you like flavorful food, this is not the place. On top of it, the woman taking our order spoke French rapidly with zero indication that we would understand her. That's just rude. Je ne parle pas francais - at least not at that speed. And rattling away in French to a customer in the US does not impress me or make me think the food is authentic. It would need to actually taste good. Never eating there again!"}
{"text":"Baguettes and other baked items are usually good. However, the service is mediocre at best. A couple of years ago I went a few times for baked goods. I would see these beautiful breads on display only to be handed one from another location that was either burnt or significantly smaller than all the others. I was going past recently and decided to give them another chance. I ordered a baguette. There were about 8 or 9 lovely ones on display. The one I was handed was only 2/3 the size of those. I asked if perhaps he thought I had ordered a demi-baguette and began to hand the bread back to him. He rudely shoved it back in my hand declaring it was not a demi. When asked if he would give me one of the full length baguettes he just walked away. That is the last time I will ever purchase anything from this establishment!"}
{"text":"Amazing French bakery goods. I never leave without a slice of quiche (feeds two easily) and a chocolate croissant. Absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"This place is delightful! - you would expect this type of place to be in Middleton or downtown Madison, not in its west-side nearby-mall location. I had a tartine de provencal and their tomato soup = delicious! Sooo good! I will definitely be back. and, despite some of the other reviews, I thought the service was divine! We had about 4 people check up on us. Delightful place! A little cramped at lunchtime, but just adds to the bakery ambiance. Be forewarned - it is cash/check only!"}
{"text":"My fiance and I come here almost every week just for the croissants.  They are full of buttery goodness and freshly baked daily by the master baker (raised & trained in France).  They are quite generous in size so we usually get away with splitting one.  I would also recommend their quiche (again, large portion so may need to share), brioche and olive bread.  One of the main girls at the cash register is consistently impersonal and impatient (will ask several times if you're ready to order even when there is no line and will stand there and stare you in the eye until you make your decision) but surprisingly it doesn't bother me much as the quality of the food definitely outweighs the importance of friendliness in this circumstance.  Also, there are a couple of students that work there who are incredibly friendly as is the baker.  Another common complaint is that they don't accept credit cards so come prepared."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service. Helpful at the counter. Fresh breads and pastries -very authentic. Great place to pick up crusty bread for homemade soups.
Looking forward to trying more of the menu.

Need cash to shop.

Cute, relaxing atmosphere."}
{"text":"Microwaved croissant. Really? The flaky pastry was soggy.Colectivo serves theirs room temp. I'll go there next time."}
{"text":"Very good authentic French cuisine. I lived in France for a while, so it's nice to find a place in Madison that does such a good job of capturing the atmosphere of typical restaurants in France. That being said, I'm not personally a big fan of French cuisine, so I have a little trouble objectively rating their food. They offer soups, sandwiches, quiches, and various pastries. From what I can discern, the quality is great and everything is fresh. The bakery items are wonderful, especially the fruit tarts and baguettes. Be warned: they only take cash...no credit cards allowed. I've gone when it's extremely crowded and there isn't a single seat available, but I've also gone when I'm the only person in the restaurant. Many of the staff are French, which provides a nice opportunity to practice speaking French, a rarity in Madison. I do recommend it, particularly for lunch."}
{"text":"It's obvious that their food is delicious. I've had only a few experiences there but have always had delicious experiences - baked bread, pastries or quiche. However... If the hours are stated online AND on their front door that they open at 7:30am, then they should open at 7:30am!! I made plans to meet a coworker there before work promptly at 7:30 and the lights were off, chairs were stacked on tables and there was no evidence that anyone was there. This is terrible for business; I know that I will never make plans to go there for breakfast again. This was not the first time this happened, so I've learned my lesson. (I gave two stars for the food being awesome, but it doesn't do any good if I can't even get to it...)"}
{"text":"Hmmm.  Don't know what to think.  We had a sandwich and a quiche.  Sandwich was, uh, interesting.  Bread did not seem overly flavorful.  Ingredients seemed to be quality but were very sparse.  

The thing I thought was so odd..........humongous chunks of cold butter on the sandwich.  Is that a French thing??  Reminded me of sandwiches my mom would make me as a kid -- She always spread the bread with butter, no matter the kind of sandwich, but at least she used soft butter and SPREAD it evenly over the bread.  

Nothing wrong with the quiche, but I've definitely had better.  I was hoping this would be my new go-to lunch spot, but that's looking like a big no."}
{"text":"For a bakery/restaurant this place does a nice job.  I wish the crust on the quiche were cooked better.  They seem doughy but everything else is great.  I will continue to stop in every time I'm in the area.  The croissant are yummy and the desserts are amazingly french."}
{"text":"Delicious pastries, particularly the chocolate croissant and cherry tart. Actually, every single pastry or bread I've had there has been fantastic.   I'm always happy with the friendly service.  I haven't had lunch here but it always looks so tasty. The ambiance there is relaxed and casual."}
{"text":"The \"boule\" is unmatched anywhere in town. It induced a brief and poignant moment of Proustian reverie.  The baguette is also a good facsimile to what I remember in its homeland.  The croissant flies into a million flakes on first bite (this is a good thing!). The strip mall is a draw back for any dine in."}
{"text":"So far, I've had croissants of various sorts and baguettes from La Baguette. They have been outstanding! The baguettes are crusty but soft and wonderful inside. My 11-year-old rates the pain au chocolat (chocolate croissants) her all-time favorite. Good coffee, too. A pleasant place to sit down for a little meal or snack."}
{"text":"I stopped in at La Baguette today with my mom for pastries. I had not been there before, but I most definitely will be going back. It was great! The staff was so awesome, they made us feel fancy:) They called me madame, nice:)
I totally recommend this place to everyone!!"}
{"text":"This is the best French Bakery in the whole Midwest. I am now living in Chicago, and I make the trip to Madison just to be able to satisfy my craving for real French bakery. I am French, and it is very difficult to find a good authentic French bakery."}
{"text":"My favorite lunch place (I happen to work in West Madison). The breads are the big draw here--an incredible range of beautiful, crusty choices, made daily. I don't eat a lot of carbs, but these are worth the occasional indulgence. _All_ of their sandwiches are excellent (served on various breads), as are the salads. Soups are just okay. They are open for breakfast through 6:00 PM, so get in early if you want take home dinner. All food items are fresh and light. I've never been to France, but if this is what real French food is like, I'm there. Oh yeah, the pastries are to die for. Panera is not bad, but if you want the real deal, go to La Baguette (soon)."}
{"text":"This is not really fair because it was a very long time ago and at their old location but I once ordered soup and they brought it out by the cash register before I paid.  When she handed me my change, a nickel literally fell in my soup.
I was shocked to hear her tell me it will be okay and to just go ahead and fish it out.  She made no move to take back the soup with the nickel in it that SHE dropped.
I was so shocked and I thought wow if that is what they do in front of the customer, what goes on behind the customers view.   I had to insist that she take it back but I think I switched to a different soup so she could not reserve it to me.    I never went back and I did call and complain."}
{"text":"It is good bread. I will be back again; will have to remember to carry cash. My only disappointment is they don't take debit/credit cards; this is 2013. Get Square or something."}
{"text":"I've been to La Baguette several times - always to get a pastry to go. The owners are a little snooty (okay - a lot snooty), but I've generally been pleased with the quality. Another reviewer who commented on the cash only, but not liking to give change situation is spot on.

This morning I got there early and the cases were mostly empty. The woman who runs the front of house said, \"Everything's ready - we just haven't brought it out yet.\" I ordered a pain au chocolat, paid, and she brought a warm bag from the back. I thought, \"Wow - straight out of the oven. Score!\"

I took the pastry home in eager anticipation. I drew it from the bag. The top was golden and flaky, and the bottom was - RAW. Seriously - that thing needed at least another 20 minutes in the oven. 

I paid $3.25 for a pastry that was inedible - but I was too far away and pressed for time to do anything about it. They should NEVER have sold it to me - and there is no way they didn't know.

Shame on you, La Baguette. Never again."}
{"text":"Croissants the way they should be.... Flaky buttery layers of goodness! Great sandwhiches, fabulous coffee, gorgeous pastries to impress guests at your next Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"I absolutely love La Baguette. From their excellent authentic French desserts to their breads, everything I have tried was superb.  If you are looking for an \"American French\" restaurant, you can go somewhere else. Having traveled to France, this bakery made me feel like I was back in Europe. The family that runs the business has always been friendly to me each time I visited. If you are courteous to them, they will be courteous to you! Their goat cheese quiche and macarons are my favorite items. Bring cash, or a local check to pay."}
{"text":"I had the spinach-mushroom quiche and my friend had another quiche.  They were both tasty with a crisp crust.  We shared a pear torte that was also delicous, but the crust was a little tough.  I also bought a cinnamon roll to go; while I was waiting in line, I struck up a conversation with the woman ahead of me.  She convinced me to by a load of bread with some cheese melted on top.  I don't know what it was called, but it was a hit at the party later that day.  If you ask for water you get a carafe full and glasses - fine with me.  I heated up the cinnamon roll the next day and it was nice but I would prefer just a smidge more icing."}
{"text":"Amazing food here! The sandwiches are great, served on homemade bread and the tortes are fantastic. I'd eat here all the time if I could afford it :( bring cash though, they don't take credit."}
{"text":"Get the Parisienne (ham, gruyere, cornichons on a baguette), or a pain au chocolat. C'est incroyable!"}
{"text":"First, I cannot speak to the authenticity of this food - I've never been to France and have no idea what qualifies as authentic French food.  But I like the pastries at Baguette, a lot.

I've tried probably half a dozen pastries there, ranging from a traditional croissant to pain au chocolat and others, and they were all excellent - flaky, moist, delicious, just great.

I only subtract one star because their hours are more limited than I would like.  Also, the owners sometimes go on vacation, leaving the store closed for several days.  So probably half the times I've gone there they've been either closed earlier than one would expect, or closed for the week because of vacation.

Also, although I have not been to France, the service at La Baguette is what I would imagine 'French' service to be.  They are not necessarily unpleasant - but rather curt and somewhat impersonal.  The atmosphere of the shop and staff is a bit 'bourgeois.' They get you your stuff (after correcting your good faith attempt at French pronunciation ;), give the obligatory polite smile, and they're done with you.  As I said, it's probably just a cultural difference, but it seems abrupt and borderline rude to this naive American.  Of course, YMMV."}
{"text":"Drlicious, authentic French food and pastries, but they don't take plastic! Zut alors!"}
{"text":"Friendly service and fantastic pastries! I particularly love their pear tart: buttery, cinnamon-y deliciousness. Their baguettes are also excellent. Et on peut parler français ici! Owned by a French couple, so it's pretty legit."}
{"text":"I don't consider myself an expert in French pastries by any means, but these were the best pastries I have ever had. I had a macaron, which was perfectly made and absolutely delicious, and a tarte au poire (pear tart) which was fantastic. I also took a fresh baguette home & can't wait to try that as well.

The owners speak French, but even with the language barrier (I know some French but am not anywhere near fluent) they were incredibly helpful, friendly, and really fun. My mother in law says their croissants are the best she has ever had, but they were out of them since we came so late in the afternoon. I would recommend getting there in the morning to try one, we will definitely be doing that ourselves. 

In addition to pastries they also have a large selection of sandwiches and quiche available if you would like to order lunch, as well as coffee and espresso drinks and other beverages. It was so worth the drive from Verona! We will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Went when it first opened and had terrible service the rudest people I have had to offer from ever and then I went again about a week ago, had the same horrible experience person behind the counter insulted our intelligence when we were looking at the menu board on the wall at the drinks saying we weren't going to see what was in the case we had to walk over to the case. My girlfriend asked what flavored they had to put in the drinks and the person said I don't know look at the bottles on the counter... All the labels for the bottles were facing them and we could not see the flavors. When we got our pastry we were standing at the register and a woman came up to ring us out and she stood there talking to someone in French while we were waiting to pay for a couple minutes. This place is the last place I will ever go again. The pastry didn't even taste good had some chocolate ganache thing and the crust was hard as a rock just ended up throwing that disgusting \"food\" in the trash."}
{"text":"I like to stop in for a chocolate croissant when I'm in Madison."}
{"text":"Truly awesome French bakery convenient to most of Madison.  What really makes it special is the cafe.  Great French wines reasonably priced.  Soups are homemade and there is a vegetarian option, which was nice for my friend.  Quiche, especially the mushroom and cheese, is incredible.  Great service.  This is just a fabulous place to stop by and have a light meal and wine for lunch and buy a dessert and a baguette for later.  A Madison gem.  Tres bien!  Bon appetit!"}
{"text":"One thing that really is not excusable in my book is when food is served to you partially warm.  I understand that the food has been sitting in the deli cooler, but deng. Take that extra minute and heat my food up correctly.

I ate a ham and swiss quiche.  It wasn't warm.  It  did taste good, though I've had much better in France.

I tasted a friend's ham sandwich and the bread's denser than I would like.  He enjoyed it though."}
{"text":"Food is simple and delicious. My personal favorites are the Quiches and EVERYTHING THEY HAVE FOR DESSERT. 

As other reviewers have said, the bread is the strong point, but I've yet to have anything I did not enjoy. The portions are sometimes a little smaller than I'd like but that's a relatively minor complaint - I feel like I'm getting what I'm paying for."}
{"text":"The almond croissants are my favorite.  I always stop at LaBaguette when I'm in Madison."}
{"text":"La Baguette is a little slice of France that should not be missed. I have been to France and this is just like the patisserie I frequented in Paris.  

My favorite is the rich choclatine slightly warmed. The butter in the pastry in combination with  the melted and warm chocolate as a pure delight.  The buzz from the chocolate is one I enjoy over a cup of coffee.

The display cases are so inviting highlighting the works of the  talented artists in the kitchen.  Standing in line viewing these treats is with the wait.

The atmosphere is warm and inviting and usually busy, but again any slight wait is so worth it.

If you have never been,  this place is a must. If you never get to France, you can at least enjoy it's tastes."}
{"text":"Best croissants in America.  Hands down.
Having living in France for some time and different places around the US, this place is up there with the best French bakeries i've ever been to.  Sure, they dont have the widest selection, but it's a small bakery, what do you expect?  But what they do have is amazing.
Wish i lived in Madison just so i could go here every day."}
{"text":"We went here for a coffee and snacks. The ambience was neat. Felt like I was in a small French country side cafe. Service was pleasant. 

We had a lattee, hot coffee and ice coffee, fruit tart, and cherry flan. Everything we had was good but not out of the ordinary. 

This is a small family run cafe and u can see the difference in the service they provide. I heard some quest talking about how good they baked breads were. Will come again for them."}
{"text":"I love this place. I often get quiche and espresso. Both deserve 5 stars. Don't forget to take home a loaf of bread"}
{"text":"Whenever I am craving chocolate, which happens a lot, I stop in here and get a Chocolate Tart. YUM!! I've tried a few of the breads, the names of which escape me now but they were all great! I haven't tried many of the other pastries- every time I go in I think 'try something new' but then I see the Chocolate Tart and I just can't resist, its just too perfectly chocolaty!"}
{"text":"As suggested,  I went with the asparagus quiche and it was fabulous.  I could not ask for a better start.  I did try a dessert pastry and felt that it was lacking moisture.  I had never had fondant before but wanted to try their heart fondant covered layered cake.  The mousse  inside was great but I felt it was sandwiched between two layers of ...passable cake.  I think I came in at the wrong time for that dessert.  I will go back and try the fresh strawberry and cream cake.  While inside waiting, I noticed many folks coming in just for loaves of bread.  That, too, will be on my list to pirchase."}
{"text":"Fun li'l stop on my way to State Street with a Madison native. I was really hoping for some French macarons, but alas it was nowhere to be found. No matter, my friend and I got a chocolate pastry, kinda like a pain au chocolat, but bigger, and a peach tart. The chocolate bread was just OK, even with it nuked a little bit, it was still pretty average. The peach tart was much, much better, with a wonderfully buttery shell and the right amount of peach filling that's just so...Goldilocks. I'm sure you get the point. 
The interior is very charming and tries to bump up the French-ness of the place with French magazines available. Overall, the place wasn't magnifique, but it was at least tres bien."}
{"text":"I have not been to France, and frankly don't care much about authenticity.  But I do care about good food.  And oh sweet Jeebus, this food is good.

I have had the Onion Soup, The ham sandwitch, brie sandwitch, chocolate and fruit tarts, eclairs, quiche and sampled a few other dishes.  Everything was great.  

Every.  Damn.  Thing.

I can't order quiche anywhere else now because it's so leaden and flavorless compared to La Baguette's

I live on the east side, I only drive across the Isthmus when I can't avoid it.  but since I discovered this place I have been doing a lot more shopping near West Town.  I consider myself lucky it is not located on Willy street, or I would be many pounds heavier by now.

Only quibble I have is not being able to go on Sundays when I have more time to drive around for brunch.  And they seem to have had some growing pains as they have added staff, but nothing major."}
{"text":"La Baguette is a family owned French bakery with friend service and tasty treats! Everything is incredibly fresh and most things are made well and baked well. I enjoyed the chocolate croossant and the Sandwich de Brie!  

The bake of the croissant was okay, some of the dough was not flaky and was doughy, probably because it was a little too warm when baking (thanks Great British Baking show for teaching me more than I ever needed to know about pastry)"}
{"text":"Every time I come here the food is wonderful, the staff is better and the prices are great.  Forever a customer!!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in Madison.  Amazing, authentic French bakery and the best coffee in town!"}
{"text":"YUM-YUM-YUM & CASH-CASH-CASH!

This is my favorite little French pastry shop. Talk about authentic...I have stopped by this place numerous times and am always amused by the guys and gals speaking French around the tables! 

I love their bread and croissants! Super buttery, super yummy, super-duper!

The only downfall is this is a check or cash place - no credit cards here. 

if you feel the need for some great French bakery then look no further."}
{"text":"A real nice place for a morning coffee and treat. There are pastries here that you just can't find elsewhere in the Madison area. There are also nice light sandwiches delivered on fresh bread or rolls which makes for a pleasant lunch/brunch."}
{"text":"Excellent European bakery. Authentic french style. The owner went to french culinary school for years. And not just become a baker out of the blue like others around have done and that's why they are all the same. Must try! Quality and flavor are wonderful."}
{"text":"Decent for Madison. Staff are a little snobbish. The sandwiches and desserts are good. The bread is its selling point."}
{"text":"Madison's best bakery.  The tarts are great.  You definitely shouldn't miss the tarte au citron (lemon tart).  They also bake great bread.

I haven't tried any of the sandwiches or quiches, but I have to seriously fight the urge to buy a tart every time I drive by."}
{"text":"I stopped into La Baguette for lunch today after reading all the great reviews on Yelp. I really enjoyed my lunch. I had the asparagus Quiche. It was great! It was a delicious mixture of egg, cheese, and asparagus. The crust was flaky and buttery.

If you are looking for an authentic French cafe this is the place. The people working behind the counter were speaking French and many of the customers were as well. For a moment I felt like I was back in Paris. The staff were very friendly. While I ate my lunch quite a few people came in and ordered the quiche. 

They also had a lot of bread and bakery items. I will have to try some of those next time I stop in. The looked amazing and there was a sweet bakery smell to the cafe."}
{"text":"Very authentic?! There was even a faint resentment towards people without exact change and those who did not speak French."}
{"text":"Incroyable!  This is the most authentic patisserie around...speak French and they will love you.  The chocolatine - try it at least once."}
{"text":"Great little cafe. Cash only. Oddly enough the highlights here are the non-bakery case items. I haven't been impressed with their croissants, etc but have completely fallen in love with their quiche as well as the tartines. The goat cheese quiche is divine. It's topped with some excellent herb as well as very fresh tasting black pepper. The crust isn't overwhelming so it lets the eggs and other ingredients shine. The tartine de brie was delicious! And the side salad it comes with was fresh and perfectly dressed. 

One visit on a Saturday morning we came in to find nearly empty bakery displays. The owner quickly explained everything had just come out of the oven and though the items were still in the back, she assured us it was all for sale. I like to look at all the goodies before deciding so I was a bit disappointed in this. I don't know if that's a regular occurrence or not but certainly by the time we finished our breakfast, the cases were full of goodies. If you are like me and need to see everything, I'd suggest coming in about an hour after opening. 

Needless to say this is a great place where everything is fresh fresh fresh :)"}
{"text":"Wonderful service and so nostalgic to hear everyone speaking in French. The asparagus quiche was delicious-- perfect fluffed and with crisped cheese! The crust was perfect as well! The French onion soup was great as well, though I wish it had been put in the broiler prior to serving to get a nice crispy crust of cheese on top. The salad was wonderful-- lined with olive oil, red wine vinegar and garlic. And most importantly, the tart du citron was to die for!!! AMAZING."}
{"text":"So far, everything we've had here is very good. We've at least three or four kinds of their breads and all are crusty and chewy inside, with great flavor. The croissants are excellent, as is the chocolatine. The small ciabattas are wonderful with a salad at home. Considering the quality and consistency, the prices are very fair across the board. The place is often busy and the staff does a pretty good job managing a near to full house. Even though it's in a strip mall, I like the atmosphere inside. The ice-less water that they serve is a nice detail that takes us back to the cafes of Europe. 

In a town with too many bakeries that can't even turn out good bread, this place is a gem."}
{"text":"Second time I've been to La Baguette, but first time in Madison. I remember enjoying the place when it was in Minocqua, oh, 7 years ago, and I did this time too.  

I had a chevre and basil quiche which was thin (which I enjoyed, I'm used to thick quiches) and very tasty. Fresh baguette's always good. Fruit tart was ok with a pretty tough crust, but I never really enjoy them as much as I think I will anyway. I ended up spending ~$14 on the quiche, a baguette, fruit tart, and hot chocolate, but you could get a very reasonably priced lunch by getting the quiche (~$4) and a baguette (~$2.50) and foregoing desert. It's an entire baguette, so you if you don't want to bring home bread I'd advise you to share it.

Went back for a prosciutto sandwich the next day. It was a bit light on the prosciutto for my taste since the flavor was overpowered by the veggies on the sandwich. A chocolate brioche was was not as rich or sweet as I would have guessed, but still very tasty. Sandwiches were around $7. I want to try some of their other sandwiches, but that'll have to be after the quiche.

4 stars since I'm left wanting to try more and will definitely be back for the chevre and basil quiche."}
{"text":"Love this place! Quick, inexpensive, and amazing quality of food. Any of the freshly-baked breads or pastries are delicious, and the salads and sandwiches are also full in flavor."}
{"text":"I've been here several times, by myself and with others. My recommendation is to get your food to go. 

The food is fantastic. The quiche, sandwiches, and pastries I've tried are delicious. The pain au chocolat is just wonderful!

The service is inconsistent, but mostly mediocre. They do not bring out the table's meals together, and it can take at least minutes for everyone to get their food. It makes for an awkward dining experience, so if you must eat there, I'd suggest eating alone."}
{"text":"Excellent bread and pastries. Great little cafe to stop for a light lunch. Authentic French cuisine."}
{"text":"Good good desserts love it, not a big fan of salad and others but desserts are sooo good to have. Macaroons are delicious too. Bring a box to Home for sure."}
{"text":"I wish I had a place like this in Boston!

You walk in and your eyes are drawn to the food displays in glass - when I was there it was a variety of breakfast pastries and lunch foods, like quiches. Then you notice all the different types of bread behind the counter - baguettes and all types of other shapes.

I think the art of French food is not only to get the complicated things right, but also the simple things. So a very good baguette goes a long way, and my friend who took me there swears by them (and to give her credibility, she was partially raised in France). We split a butter croissant, which was divine (simplicity perfected) and I had what looked like a pain au chocolate, but had a different French name I can't remember now. It was like a pastry sandwich with chocolate chips. Oh my gosh! I also had some of the pain au raisin that my friend got, which was also fantastic.

The food was heated nicely and brought out to us on a tray that looked like those pictures you see of French bakeries. I loved the selection, and I wish I had had a chance to try more of it."}
{"text":"I went to this place a year ago and remembered thinking it wasn't that great, but don't remember why.   Today I was in the area, so gave it another try. The baguette was very good. Not exactly how I remember them in France on visits last summer and 2 years ago, but still good. However, the almond/chocolate croissant was terrible. It was flat and the bottom was completely soggy. There was no flakiness at all. Total waste of $3.75. I couldn't even finish it since it was so bad, and that's saying something.   I generally do not complain about stuff at restaurants, but I might have brought this disgusting croissant back to the counter had I not taken it \"to go\".  The other croissants and pain au chocolate looked pale and under cooked. I was surprised since I had heard good reviews about this place. I guess I will stick to Whole Foods Market for croissants and avoid them at La Baguette if I choose to return."}
{"text":"People that complain about this place miss the point of a French bakery. Jacques Pépin, himself, would give this place a good review."}
{"text":"This is the best bakery and coffeeshop you'll find in Madison, and tastes like a little slice of Paris in the Midwest.  The croissants are excellent, and the coffee is unquestionably worth the price.  If you want a tart--go for the lemon, even if it wouldn't normally be your first pick; it's a perfect balance of sweet and sour, with a delicious pate brisee crust.  The other tarts are beautiful, but not as flavorful.  You'll spend more than you would at any other Madison-area coffeeshop, but it's such a worthwhile treat.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"La Baguette is a cute little French café located off of Mineral Point Road, conveniently next to Rejuvination spa... where I get my haircut! After my hair appointment, I popped in to grab a quiche to have for breakfast later this week. I was a little disappointed that the food selection was so limited, however, I think they were close to closing. I was torn between getting the goat cheese quiche and the asparagus quiche. When I asked the cashier which one she thought was better, she said the goat cheese-- so that is what I went with! The quiche cost me a little over six dollars and was big enough to split amongst two people. They offer breads, and some dessert options as well. I also noticed homemade croutons for sale next to the register. 

There is a small seating area, that never seems crowded, and plenty of parking out front. Just to warn you, they only accept cash or check... which has been a deterrent to me stopping in, as I usually don't carry cash. It's a great place to pop in for some bread, or a light brunch. Next time you're in the area with $$ on hand, stop in and try the quiche!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I moved to Chicago after living in Madison for 4 years, and I haven't found a boulangerie with better baguettes than here. I've tried over 40 places with strong recommendations and they all failed to meet the standard set up by this place.

I keep going back to the place, even after the older lady that only speaks French over charged me once on a baguette. At the time it was marked as 2.75, but she insisted on trois, trois! I didn't know how to say 2.75 in French so I hung my head in shame and paid the extra quarter. I still haven't forgotten about it after 4 years. Still, the call of the delectable pastries and boules call to me, even 200 miles away in Chicago. I come here every time I am in town. 

Oh well.

Sometimes I would just eat a whole rustic baguette with some butter for a meal. When I die, I want to be buried in their cream puffs.

I am glad they only take cash, because if they took cards I would be up to my man-boobs in credit card debt.

Tre bien"}
{"text":"The chevre quiche is very good. My fiancée and I split two of their sandwiches when we go because they're all so good. We had the Parisian and fermier today, both excellent. If only they took credit cards, I would give them 5 stars. Coffee is also great."}
{"text":"I really like this place.  I've had the sandwiches, soup, croissants, and quiche and it's all really great.  I can't understand why some of the chain sandwich/bread places are packed when this place exists."}
{"text":"It's neat that they speak French here! However that was the only thing that really made a lasting impression on me. 

I tried their tomato soup which was very watery, didn't really seem hearty at all. 

The goat cheese quiche, I appreciate this being warmed up. This was pretty good but the dough seemed a little undercooked. 

Ordered one of the sandwiches, these do not come with the bread warmed which I would have loved. But maybe they are pre-made and ready to go. The baguette was good and overall a okay sandwich.

The chocolate croissant was not crispy with lots of flaky layers. It was like a doughy pillow. When you picked it up it would start to droop and did not hold it's shape. This was probably the most disappointing thing we tried. 

They only accept cash and check. For being such a large storefront I was a little surprised by this. 

Someone else at another table ordered some sort of smoked salmon sandwich. This I did not see on the menu, secret item!?"}
{"text":"Nice little French bakery. The quality of the baked goods and lunch items is really remarkable and reasonably priced. I've been there several times for lunch and enjoyed the sandwiches and soups including the French Onion soup. The breads are fantastic. Of course you'll want to save room for dessert."}
{"text":"My new favorite. My americano was made perfectly, I actually had to have another!  Cannot wait to try more food items. Croissant was buttery and flaky. Quiche flavorful. I will be bringing my husband with me next time."}
{"text":"Two things I love:  Tarte au citron and tarte au chocolat.  These two things are done fabulously here.  I've bought 10?  20?  of them in the past year, year and a half and have never been disappointed.  The batards are also very very good.

Come to think of it, I've not been disappointed here.  I think it's cash only though."}
{"text":"This place used to be so much better! I'm super disappointed - again. I'm here right now, and really wish I had picked a different place. The latte and cappuccino that we ordered were the worst expresso drinks I've ever tasted. Ever. They tasted like they came from a vending machine. My pastry (cherry almond torte) was ok but it was served ice cold. My mom got the raisin brioche which was stale. When we asked for a refund for the coffees,we were told that no one working here today is allowed to do that. Actually a group of employees all gathered around to say they couldn't do anything. Well, one woman did give us the business card and said we should contact the owner.  Thanks for nothing."}
{"text":"Great place. Really good bread, sandwiches and quiche! Good place to grab a sweet too to snack on while reading a book :)."}
{"text":"I'm developing a habit of getting a treat from La Baguette every Saturday morning at the Stevens Point farmers market. The two gentlemen are always very friendly and always explain what each of the items is. I don't think I could go wrong selecting at random without the explanations though, everything is always delicious. We've tried the cinnamon rolls, brioche, different kinds of croissants, and a few other items whose names escape me, and have always been pleased. It makes for a lovely breakfast before stocking up on produce and other goodies at the market."}
{"text":"Cute inside
Almost like a French Cafe. Prices could be better. A whole Quiche can be made for the same price they charge for a piece. If you are going to drop $10.00 on coffee and bread, try La Brioche. You'll fall in love. And they take cards. This place doesn't."}
{"text":"Good bakery. I have been here many times in the past and came today for a quiche. I had a coffee drink with me and saw the sign for \"no outside food or beverages\" on the door. I hadn't know about it since I hadn't been in awhile. I immediately apologized before I ordered. The owner commented on it and I apologized again and said I would honor that moving forwards. When he brought my food out I asked for water and he looked at me and said \"no\" and left even though all the other tables were given water and I had always been served it in the past. It's unfortunate because I had always liked this place but that interaction made me feel very uncomfortable and unwelcome. I will not come here again."}
{"text":"Just lovely. Visited for an early morning treat. French television in the background made me feel like I was visiting France. Double espresso and quiche - yum. Lots of seating. This made grading papers a delightful experience. Will return with friends for lunch and wine! Cash only."}
{"text":"Update: 

I tried there for lunch with my bestie. My experience with La Baguette this time was actually much better than the first time. No frustrated, yelling french (posing) dude or bad food. The madam at the casher was lovely and quite pleasant.

I ordered the french onion soup and a side salad. The soup, which is a signature soup of every \"french\" place, was actually quite tasty. Apparently, La Baguette went with chicken broth and not the traditional beef broth, but the end result was quite palatable and that's what matters with me. Let's just call it \"avantgarde,\" and you can actually care less about what broth they use.

The salad was nothing too special, but not horrible either. In my book keeping, \"not horrible\" matters, too - so this time around, I'm willing to give 3 stars. 

The conclusion, just be careful what to order - you might come out of the cafe with a smile if you eat the right stuff."}
{"text":"Cozy place to grab a few pastries and some tea. Very French -- the food is authentic and good quality, especially the bread pastries, but the service is detached and noncommittal. We weren't given napkins, silverware, or anything besides what we strictly ordered, which was annoying, since it's hard to catch their attention to ask for additional stuff. I got the impression that they got annoyed if you asked for anything, but my mother (who has been to France) told me they just don't \"pretend\" like servers do in the US. 

I'd recommend their croissants (very buttery and layered), and their other puff pastries, like the amandine. Their tarts are average; the crust isn't very good but the fruit was fresh on mine and the custard was a nice sweetness and consistency. Go here for the bread,  handmade pastries, and atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place is way too rude and pretentious for my taste. Every other review is negative and I should have listened. They don't take credit card and the service is molasses slow. I would especially avoid on a Saturday morning."}
{"text":"Really cute place to check out! Like everyone else has said, it truly is an authentic French bakery - be prepared to hear French, order from the French-speaking owner (in my case, using a lot of gestures and trying to use whatever basic French abilities I retained), and pay in cash. It's a large open space and the display of baked pastries is jaw-dropping. From beautifully crafted macaroons to the largest pain au chocolat that I have ever seen in my life, this is your go-to place for an pick-me-up sweet treat. They also have a hot menu which you can order from, ranging from soups and salads to tartines. Some of my individual item reviews:

-Chocolate Tart: INCREDIBLE. Definitely would recommend sharing with a friend, because the chocolate is rich but the perfect level of sweetness, almost between milk chocolate and dark chocolate. Never wanted it to end. Super sad times when it did.

-Salmon Tartine: Good, simple, and fresh. Served with fresh-squeezed lime and topped with chives. Pretty standard overall, but very good if this is what you're looking for.

-Prosciutto Tartine: Amazing. Served with blue cheese, walnuts, and sweet, sweet pear slices. A lot of really intense flavors playing together at once, but in the most beautiful way. Would highly recommend.

-Macaroons: Beautiful aesthetically, also average taste. The strawberry macaroon tasted very artificial, but was probably one of the most gorgeous macaroons I have ever seen (very Instagram worthy).

-Tomato Basil Soup: Delicious. You can really taste the tomatoes in this (which can be good or bad, depending on your preference) and it retains a thick texture topped with spices. It's served with a plate of swiss cheese and homemade seasoned croutons to put in. This soup was one of my favorite parts of my visit and comes in a perfect size.

This bakery really did an incredible job retaining its authenticity - it really made me feel like I was back in European cafe. Although the atmosphere is not as warm or cozy as I expected (no music, pretty simple tables/chairs, average service), I still think La Baguette is a great place to stop by to enjoy some pastries with company."}
{"text":"I dig the quiche and pastries. Just so you know what to expect, this is very much a little bakery with a bit of cafe to it, not a full-service restaurant. If you go in thinking you're going to get a sit down meal beyond a pastry, quiche, sandwich or soup, well, that's not what they have here. 

My wife and I like to have a simple coffee 'n quiche weekend breakfast here sometimes. Maybe a pastry as well. My problem is I want to buy ALL of the pastries. I usually succeed in avoiding doing that. 

Negatives are sometimes the coffee is a little weak, and I have to muddle my way through talking to the cashier who only speaks French. (I'm vaguely conversational in Spanish so I sorta kinda know what she's saying.) And yes it's cash only."}
{"text":"I was only here once and only got one thing, so take my 2 stars as you will. But given that you only get one chance to make a first impression, and that my first impression was not that great, it's hard for me to imagine going back to try more things to flush out my impression.

Weekend mornings mean coffee and pastries for me and when I saw this place I had high hopes that it would be my go-to Saturday morning bakery. I knew from the Yelp reviews that they don't take credit cards and yet I totally forgot that piece when I showed up. Fortunately there is an ATM in the parking lot. Based on the glowing Yelp reviews I decided that it would certainly be worth the $2.75 service fee so I ran out to the ATM and came back.

I ordered a coffee and a scone. The 3 scone flavors were raisin, chocolate and almond. None of those are flavors I would usually get so I asked the French woman which one she thought was best and got the raisin based on her recommendation. It was terrible.. The outside was almost burnt, but the inside was under-baked. I wasn't necessarily expecting it to be the best scone I've ever had, but I was at least expecting it to be better than the ones I make.

I might go back; it's close by and I liked the way it felt inside., but it will probably be a while before I try again, especially since they don't open until 7:30a.m. and are closed on Sundays which strikes me as a bad strategy for a coffee shop/bakery."}
{"text":"The quiche will change your life.  

Does that sound like an overstatement?  Probably.  I mean, it won't make you rich (unless you can find a way to market it to the masses, and then it might). It probably won't help you find the love of your life - but if you do and s/he doesn't like this quiche then it probably wasn't meant to be.  Maybe it will make you smarter - I mean, ordering the quiche is a smart thing to do, so if you order it you must be pretty smart, right?

If I lived on the west side of town, I would probably have a slice of quiche weekly.  At least.  It comes in a variety of delectable flavors, but the star of this little slice of heaven is the pairing of thin crust and light custardy eggs.  This is no thick triangular slice of over-cooked egg product.  No.  This is the real deal.

While you're ordering, don't forget to choose a sweet from the case and a loaf of bread to take home (the olive loaf is particularly good).  But get there early, choices get slim the later in the day it gets.  And for heaven's sake - don't forget the quiche!"}
{"text":"I was shocked at the authenticity of the place. Unassuming and really a hidden gem in Madison. I had a great time catching up with my brother while I munched on a tasty sandwich and sipped a warm cup of coffee. I will definitely be back if I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this visit! It's definitely tucked away in a very unFrench place -- another plaza a la Americana. The inside of the café also felt really \"American space trying to be French\" so I wasn't expecting much when I walked in, but I shouldn't let looks deceive me. The woman who took our order was French and French speaking; she would repeat your order back to you in French like she was confirming it and assumed you also spoke French. It was cute. She seemed stressed out, though.

We ordered cappuccinos, which were delicious. Then we split a tomato basil focaccia. And um, oh my word. The biggest problem? We both put it in our mouths immediately. So stupid. My mouth is still in pain. It was a lot hotter than expected! And doing that odd open-mouthed sort-of breathing-on-it thing DID NOT WORK.

We pushed through with a cup of veggie soup -- bland in a lovely way that made me want it next time I was sick and wanted something filling without too much intense flavor. Derek got a salmon tartine then and I got the brie tartine. Extremely filling even though they were a bit small. With the cup of soup, it was the perfect amount. The French understand it all!

On our way out, we both ordered some to-go pastries. They didn't make it home.

When we visited New Orleans in 2010, I went to a little place in the French Quarter where I had the best almond croissant in the world. It was flakey and warm and buttery with this wonderfully not-too-sweet almond filling.

This was not that croissant. BUT ...  in a way, they were not comparable. These croissants weren't exactly flakey, but they were pretty buttery. It gave it this dense texture. Parts were a little crisp, even a little burnt, but it was just fine. Oh I ate it all up! Derek had a Paris-brest, or this hazelnut eclair ... I literally didn't see him take a bite. I handed it to him and it was gone. Haha.

I wish it was closer to us, because we'd love to go back. I just hope next time I don't burn my mouth. :("}
{"text":"My wife and I come by for lunch at least once a month. I LOVE their french onion soup and sandwiches. You will not get this menu anywhere else in Madison. My wife loves their baked goods. If you're in the mood for a slow lunch, sitting outside and taking a moment to enjoy this is the place.

It only takes cash though, but still worth it."}
{"text":"La Baguette is truly a very nice bakery - very European indeed!  I have been living in France for the past six months, and I feel it's just like in France (though many of the items are larger because they service American customers!)
I miss speaking French, and it's nice that I can go in there and speak French again!  Some of the people there know me and so always talk to me in French, which I love!  I am a huge fan of their cinammon rolls, and they have a great French wine selection (not vast, but good quality).  It's quaint and cute... only wish is they had ice cubes available, and wi-fi! 
haha.... I hope to go there again soon!

A bientot!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I stopped in yesterday for a latte and a chocolate croissant. Super delish. The people who work there speak French, and they are always happy. They take your order right away, and serve you fresh, tasty \"real\" food. The La Nicoise salad is REALLY good. This place is quaint, small and clean. I've been there several times, and I always enjoy the authentic French experience. Yay!"}
{"text":"For a French Bakery shop in the Madison, La Baguette has a decent selection of bread, salad, sandwiches and two soups: tomato basil or French onion. We've came here a few times based on a friend's recommendation (it's honestly one of her favorite shops in town).

For brunch this morning, I got a fruit tart and chai latte. The crust of the tart was hard to bite into, and was a little messy to eat but still tasted good. The chai latte was semi-sweet but did taste a little watery. My boyfriend got a sandwich which the bread was hard and not warmed with tiny pickles that was barely noticeable.

Overall, I can see how this place can appeal to others, and it's worth trying out at least once to see if you like the type of French Bakery cuisine. Just remember to bring cash or check as they do not accept any card and beware of using large bills. You might just end up with a wallet full of coins as change."}
{"text":"We enjoy coming here often. Their pastries and baked goods taste just like what we got in France. Owners are super nice and always there helping customers. 

The chocolate croissants are light and so soft and pillowy. I also enjoy the almond croissants which are usually piping hot still when we get there. My huband likes the chocolatine. And one of my guilty pleasure both for the price ($2.50/ea) and taste are their french macarons. They are amazing, like insanely good. My favorites are the vanilla and coconut. I've also had the rose and salted caramel. I try not to get them too much because next thing I know I end up spending $10 on four little cookies...yikes! But no joke they are little bite size pieces of heaven and they are really pretty too. We've also gotten their bread here which is equally as good as their pastries. I haven't tried their lunch items but they have a variety of sandwiches, soups and salads."}
{"text":"I really love the authenticity of La Baguette. The owners are French, and that makes me happy. I took 10 years of French classes and was happy to know I could understand them when they explained to me what each quiche was made of.

The quiches they have are made from local ingredients. They usually have a pretty good assortment.

I tried the Chocolatine for the first time. It was super good. Anything chocolate here is pretty darn good. I also had the Chocolate Ganache Tart. It was très delicieuse. 

Their bread pudding is another must-have. The caramel sauce on top is heavenly. I'm drooling just thinking about it. I've never had bread pudding before here, but I definitely like this one!

It's cash only, which is a minor inconveniwnce, but there's an ATM in the parking lot, so it works out!"}
{"text":"It's adorable. I stopped in on a sunny summer day and they had the door open to the bakery, making my visit feel like I had stumbled upon a nice neighborhood café. It seemed the type of place that would have a collection of regulars, since everything was so authentic and made with love. 

The pastry cases loomed out at me with numerous tarts and scones, but it was the croissants I was craving. I settled on a chocolate almond croissant and loved its flaky exterior and gooey almond insides. The thin layer of melted chocolate on the bottom portion of the pastry was perfection. The dark richness of the chocolate nicely complimented the sweetness supplied by the almond and both were enveloped by the croissant's soft interior. 

Can't wait to be back to try some of their famed breads, sandwiches, and definitely the tarts. There was a caramel nut one that I almost caved into buying but I wanted to savor that croissant, and that I did. Until next time."}
{"text":"Wow, paid $8 for a sandwich that had ONE very thinly slice of prosciutto, one small piece of mozzarella with tomato and lettuce. Went to the counter thinking it must be a mistake to have paid so much to receive so little.  The girl looked at me like I was crazy and said  \"yeah,  that is all you get.\"
Well that is all they get from me now.  Loved coming here and it had been awhile.  Plenty of good sandwich places in Madison i will give my money too."}
{"text":"Cherry tarts are the best! But come here on Mondays for crepes. We visited Madison and couldn't pass by this place. Very friendly atmosphere, excellent baked goods. The owners a French and know what they are doing."}
{"text":"Good food, as e European i was missing good fresh bread. Well, this is the place to get your bread. I tried the Baquette Paris with melted brie, it is like you are eating your baquette in France. Sometimes it can be busy and you have to wait for a while."}
{"text":"Great breakfast quiche and pastries! Highly recommend the asparagus quiche! The friendly staff was all speaking French when we walked in. The service was pleasant and quick. The decor is a bit dated, but it's a quaint cafe with good food.

MAKE SURE YOU BRING CASH as they do not accept credit cards. 

They had a variety of fresh baguettes that looked amazing; I can't wait to try those next time."}
{"text":"A little bit--no, a lot--of France right here in Madison. This bakery and coffeeshop draws a crowd of croissant munchers and espresso sippers for a reason. The bakery is quality, and best of all, very fresh. Come early or your choices will be limited. The chocolate croissant tastes just the way one should, and their quiches are FAB. The staff behind the counter speaks French amongst themselves between taking orders, so I'd say authenticity is a check! There are about 8 tables in the cafe, so if you want to stay for a while, be prepared to wait during early and lunch hours. But once you've got a spot, it'd be easy to sip and chat for hours as the French do is this perfect patisserie."}
{"text":"The rudest experience I have EVER had in my life. My 2 year old son was touching fake presents under the Christmas tree while we were waiting for the food to arrive. Someone working there claimed it was disruptive to touch fake presents. Then my son started to cry. We were told to leave the restaurant due to him crying. The workers and owner there said it is not a kid friendly place and to not to come back again. We were practically thrown out of the place and yelled at in French. One worker pointed to the door and yelled for us to leave. Please stay away!!! The food is mediocre quality. I have traveled to France several times and this is not representative of the high quality of French cuisine. I have only gone there in the past due to frequenting the hair salon next door. My son had just got a great haircut  and we wanted to celebrate the upcoming holiday as a family. I am a pediatric doctor and will make sure never to recommend this place to my patients or families. Not kid or family friendly despite what is posted on yelp (screen shot below)!"}
