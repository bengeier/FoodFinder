{"text":"Nice tasty English muffin.  Coffee flavour was nice as well. 

Nice server

Large ceramic coffee cups if you eat in."}
{"text":"I would recommend the breakfast bagel! A cute little cafe with real coffee and freshly prepared sandwiches. Definitely would not have found this place if it wasn't for Yelp 'cos it is not a tourist hot spot at all! Thanks guys!

Go through the mall/complex and the entrance to the cafe is from the inside of the bigger building it's housed in."}
{"text":"Tasty tasty tasty!  Went here for breakfast on a recommendation...food and coffee was great. My boyfriend and I both got the Bagel BLT and to drink he got a latte and I got the mocha.  Food was brought to the table and you pay at the end.  Great, friendly service.  Breakfast is served only until 11am.  I definitely recommend and would go again next time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"Get an espresso drink, the brewed coffee (café filtre) is mediocre and a little stale tasting."}
{"text":"Wonderful! I had the breakfast croissant which was simple yet perfectly seasoned. My wife's French toast pannetone was great though a little rich. Fresh fruit salad w mint was divine. The server / barista was great. Favorite breakfast place in Montreal."}
{"text":"We had a quick and delicious breakfast here on a recent trip to Montreal. We both got the bacon egg and cheese with lettuce and tomato, which was a nice, filling but healthy start to the day. It came with fruit salad that tasted very fresh. The latte I got was also quite good.

Unfortunately we were only able to come here once during our trip, but it was a nice starting off point for a day in Old Montreal."}
{"text":"Le meilleur café à Montréal! De plus, ils ont du lait sans lactose pour ceux avec des intolérances :-) Tous ce que nous avons commandé était fantastique! Je recommande le pain doré. Bel emplacement excellent service vraiment du A+! À ne pas manquer!"}
{"text":"Located in old Montreal this quaint little cafe is an excellent option for a quick breakfast pit stop. 

You'll nearly certainly miss the entrance because you'll think it's the entrance to the shop right next door. But don't be fooled (like us and the couple of other people that made the U-turn after they walked right past it), they share that entrance.

The breakfast menu is limited on the weekend- just a few basics. They offer pastries, fresh fruit, eggs Benedict, a croissant TMC (which is essentially hard boiled egg, lettuce, tomato, mayo, cheese, & bacon) and the classic egg and cheese on choice of bread. 

My egg and cheese was good, the croissant was perfectly flaky. My friend's TMC was delicious and her husband's eggs benedict were the subject of my admiration and envy. I would definitely go for the Benedict next time... They looked perfectly poached!

My friend ordered the \"medium latte\" which really looked like it could feed a family of 4! It was impressive and beautifully decorated with latte art. 
Despite their simple menu, they didn't skimp at all on quality or presentation. The cozy and inviting feel of the cafe earns them bonus points as well."}
{"text":"If I could give a 0 I would. The person in charge was extremely rude bordering on scary. He was so nasty to the couple waiting ahead of us that when he barked at me for trying to read the blackboard menu we decided to just leave. Best decision ever!! Don't bother with this place. Instead go to L'oeufrier! Omggg so yummy, waitress servi e at the same prices and excellent friendly service. Why go somewhere where you are treated as if the staff are doing you a favor by letting you eat there?!"}
{"text":"The cafe is great. The food was good, coffee was great, and the staff there was extremely friendly. One staff member spent 10 minutes with us going over the montreal map and giving his suggestions on where we should spend the day (we were tourists)."}
{"text":"This is an excellent spot if you are looking for a quick breakfast that is simple yet delicious.  We ate there twice and each time the staff was pleasant and eager to please.  The prices are very reasonable and the ingredients are fresh.  Chapeau!"}
{"text":"I went to Thé Mon Café twice, they have very decent coffee and tea and the staff was friendly. The place itself is only alright. I wouldn't mind coming back but it just would not be my first choice."}
{"text":"We had really good time. Calm atmosphere, good food and nice staff. We'd love to go again. one of the staff talked to us in Japanese and we were surprised. we thank for her hospitality!"}
{"text":"This is a nice option for those who want to skip the very expensive hotel breakfast at places like the Intercontinental or Westin. I went here for breakfast every morning during a week-long work trip, as it was cheap and good and had free wifi. But be prepared: breakfast is really only one option--a bacon or ham egg sandwich on a bagel or croissant. This is a tiny coffee place and they don't really have a kitchen. The coffee is good and the service is very good. 

I did not go here for lunch so cannot comment on their lunch sandwich or soup."}
{"text":"Review from January 2013:

We found this place on Yelp and were not disappointed. The cafe is cozy and quaint! I love the decor - simple and sweet. The menu isn't very extensive, but you can rest assured that whatever you order will be delicious. We had a party of 8 and the staff was very helpful in offering suggestions and describing the dishes. The fruit salad is fresh tasting and delicious, but the almond croissants stole the show. LOADED with almonds on the inside and out and held together with soft flaky pastry. 

Heaven in a crescent.

Best croissant of my life. I've been trying to find a rival ever since ... no luck."}
{"text":"Thé Mon Café is the perfect place to grab some fresh healthy food and coffee.  From Breakfast to afternoon snack, Mali and Dany make you feel welcomed into their business as if they have known you forever.  In this day and age of instant result, these guys always manage to make the experience pleasant.  I highly recommend this establishment to all who read this review and tell your friends to tell their friends and so on.   

Wishing Mali, Dany and Thé mon Café many good years to come!

D.M."}
{"text":"This was the worst experience ever.  soggy french toast.  I asked for a smoothie... then I watched from the table as he made an ice cream shake... which is not a smoothie.  A smoothie has fruit, he replaced the fruit with mango ice cream.  People are not stupid and we know when we are being lied to and it is obvious when a low class restaurant owner tries to pull the wool over our eyes and charge top dollar for it.   No salt and pepper on the tables.  bare bones for high dollar.  Very upset.  Took forever to get a coffee too... Can't believe there are any good reviews here.  It was obvious the owner/manager/whatever was trying to make everyone feel good by working his personality, but service sucked horribly."}
{"text":"Nous avons pris le petit déjeuner à 10 et nous avons été chaleureusement accueillis. Tout est excellent, les croissants, les ufs,les bagels...un bravo tout particulier pour l'accueil et le service."}
{"text":"Our family was staying in a nearby hotel for the weekend, and we found the Cafe Mon on Yelp. The good reviews were spot on. Being early-rising Americans we arrived shortly after they opened at 9 on a Saturday, and basically had the place to ourselves. 

My kids ordered chocolate-filled croissants, my wife had the French toast, and I had the TMC croissant, which is a breakfast sandwich with sliced hard-boiled egg. All were excellent, and not a scrap was left at the end (after the wife and I finished what the kids couldn't).

We also had large lattes that literally come in a bowl-sized coffee cup. They were also excellent, apparently owing in part to the ability to heat the milk and foam to a lower temperature than is required in the FDA-governed United States. Also, as you can see from the picture, our barista was an artist. 

Which brings me to my final compliment: as we were obviously tourists, and business was still quiet, our barista spent a lot of time visiting with us and offering local knowledge about Montreal. He managed to turn an already sublime breakfast into an extended great day. 

All in all, highly recommended. Care to guess where we'll be for breakfast again tomorrow?"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast while staying nearby at the Westin Montreal during a four day trip. 

When we walked in, the waiter greeted us and exclaimed that they had the best coffee. I didn't know if that was a good sign but he was right, the coffee is amazing. The food is just as good. I had a croissant with hard boiled egg. It comes with ham but I asked for it without the ham. The waiter offered me a fruit salad instead which I accepted. Later, after paying the bill and leaving, I realized they had charged me for the fruit salad. I thought that was unfair as he had offered it as a substitution but then made me pay for it. However, the fruit salad was really good so not a huge deal. More about the principal of the matter.

My hubby had the french toast with pannetone bread. I had a bite and wanted to order one myself! It was delicious! He also love the coffee.

The waiter was very friendly and we enjoyed our breakfast and would recommend without hesitation."}
{"text":"This place is really cute and my breakfast was amazing! I made up my own sandwich -an egg and cheese with avocado on a croissant and they made it perfectly. The almond milk latte was delicious too!"}
{"text":"My wife and I both had the TMC croissants and we both enjoyed them thoroughly. A nice gourmet touch to a late breakfast. The service is friendly but just know you'll have to order off the menu at the counter and pay there as well."}
{"text":"I read a lot of good reviews so decided to go. It was a an average experience. Eggs Benedicts only on weekends. The croissant was too soft. I think it's overrated"}
{"text":"Had this place for lunch as a take out. Ordered the Italian sandwich and potato salad. Sandwich tasted good and was grilled perfectly. It was a square bun with sliced Italian sausage and vegetables on it. Portions were a bit small and not ideal for sharing. 

Was good. I would recommend for someone looking for a light option for lunch that is quick and tasty."}
{"text":"Surprisingly, options are limited in Montreal for early morning breakfast. The Mon Cafe opens at 9 (not super early but other spots don't open till 11 or noon!). The menu is not huge but the food is fresh and well prepared. The cappuccinos are delicious!"}
{"text":"A little small but cozy. We had an americano and espresso which were top notch. We didn't eat but the food coming out looked good. Bathrooms are shared with the building, and you need to get the key. Would go back and would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Decor 3/5 food 3/5 staff&service 5/5
Food was delicious and prices were great. The staff is super friendly and I would recommend anyone to go but word of advice - it's a pretty small place so get there before 10am to get a spot on the weekend. I thought 12.95$ was rather expensive however for eggs benedict considering it was only two eggs benedict and a small cup of fruit, for that price at any other breakfast spot you would get toast and some roasted potatoes on top of that. But with a small latte I felt satisfied."}
{"text":"Good decent breakfast but it gets very busy here only 2 person working in this place. If you are looking for decent sit down place to chill with friends this is not the place."}
{"text":"Exceptionally friendly and efficient service
Clean and comfortable environment 
Delicious croissant TMC sandwich with ham 
Would definitely go there again!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff in a rather cold and echoey room. Mostly occupied by tourists and their naturally boisterous children. Made the mistake of ordering a latte and toatst&cheese notwithstanding the enthusiastic up-sell for Eggs Benedict and similar items. Received store bought spongy sliced bread and cheese and a surprisingly weak latte. 
I came here because of the excellent reviews but will not return."}
{"text":"Loved this place! The food and service was amazing. Loved the gentleman who served us he was so kind and polite and genuine. We had the eggs Benedict with bacon, a French toast and cappuccino and chai latte. The eggs Benedict with bacon was delicious. The French toast wasn't anything special just looked good. Maybe because I'm not a fan of raisin and it had raisin bits in the French toast. It was also too fluffy to my liking. The chai latte was also amazing they use fresh chai. I would definitely return next time I visit Montreal."}
{"text":"Really nice discovery in old Montreal. Fresh, great value and very friendly. We had wonderful chicken avocado paninis. Iced coffee was top notch."}
{"text":"My wife and I found this gem of a place in Old Montreal. It was so pleasant to eat at that we went back the next day before we had to head home to Calgary.

The owners and their staff were super friendly and we enjoyed having conversation with them while we ate. 

Make sure you swing by this place for one of their panini sandwiches."}
{"text":"4 of 4 stars (excellent, casual fare).

(see explanation of ratings below)

Great place for breakfast or lunch.  Talented baristas and excellent baked goods.

Get the TMC: sliced hard-boiled egg with your choice of bacon or ham, your choice of cheese, lettuce and tomato on a lovely croissant.

About $10-15 per person.

About my ratings:

Only high-priced dining establishments can garner five stars.  Until yelp realizes that a fast food joint cannot possibly be ranked equally with a $100 per person place, I need to draw the line somewhere.  If we were only talking about the quality and presentation of the food, it would be a different story.  But, as we know, yelp's rankings take into account the entire dining experience.

Therefore, I divide restaurants into three categories (and I wish yelp would do the same):

1) fast food and \"fast-casual\", low-priced (no table service).

2) casual, mid-priced dining (table service, average entrée price: $10-$20).

3) fine, high-priced dining (linen napkins, no plastic cups, no TV's in dining room, average entrée priced at more than $20, can vary depending on the city).

High-priced dining can earn a max of five stars.  Mid-priced dining can earn a max of four stars.  Fast food can earn a max of three stars."}
{"text":"Stop by when I was in the area..... I mean I'm a breakfast dinner fan so whenever I travel I have to try local breakfast spot. The taste was good but I think it is a bit pricy for what I got. It is worth to check out the spot but it won't be me regular for breakfast spot. I Don't Mind Stop By for some coffee tho :)"}
{"text":"L'endroit est minuscule, le personnel est sympathique et leurs cappuccinos sont absolument PARFAITS. 

Mais... Un café qui ferme à 16h, c'est beaucoup trop tôt! J'y suis allée pour écrire en après-midi en pensant que c'était ouvert tard et à 15h30, le commis passait le balais..."}
{"text":"A friendly place for a quick and delicious breakfast. After having ventured through the busy mess that was olive et gourmondo the prior morning, I was very happy to find this spot. Sadly, it was our last day! Next time I am back in Montreal, we will go back. Try the cm croissant sandwich!!"}
{"text":"If I could eat words, I'd never go anywhere else. Arrived on a Saturday morning in January and was promised \"the best food you've ever tasted\" and that they could make \"anything you can imagine\". The charm of our server was much appreciated, even when I didn't get the dish I thought I had ordered. 

The food was good; the place is tucked away: cozy, but without any view or hint of the city outside. 

I didn't really like  the coffee, but it did the trick."}
{"text":"We arrived at 11 and missed \"breakfast.\" The only thing available were pre-made (but homemade) sandwiches that were pretty average. Very small location with a regular sized flat top stove. I was actually impressed they were able to run the entire menu from one small 4 burner stove (since the breakfasts appear to be quite involved). We chose our sandwich from the display case and it was pressed for us. Beef and some sort of horseradish sauce with some added greens. Simple. Did the trick to cure the hunger but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic place for a delicious laid back breakfast. Four of us agreed that our coffees/lattes were some of the best we've ever had.. and the TMC croissant with bacon was easily the BEST breakfast sandwich I've ever eaten. By far. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped by for breakfast and it was delicious! Both of us had egg Benedict - it came with bacon and fresh fruits."}
{"text":"Yay! We're from NYC & we couldn't find any great coffee places & we found it! Trust me,it is worth the travel over to Old Port Montreal. I had a honey chai latte & my friend had a honey soy latte. Perfection. If you're hungry, get the Panatoast. French toast,bacon,& cheddar cheese,topped with maple syrup! Devine! Go,now!"}
{"text":"We had a delicious Breakfast here. We originally wanted to try their egg Benny , however, they do not serve it on the weekdays. We had the croissant tmc instead. It turned out great! We really enjoyed it. Love their latte and Moka too"}
{"text":"Most of the cafes and restaurants in the area are overpriced and under-deliver, but this one is an exception! Great sandwiches with a wide variety to choose from, with descent prices considering it's in Old Montreal. Highly recommended if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"stopped in with friends for a latte on a cold day.  Great service, friendly people and perfect coffee... what else is there to say?"}
{"text":"Cripes sake, here we go again with the \"big 5\" review.
But lookit, this place is a GEM.  Hah, that even sounds fresh like I am being sarcastic~promise I'm not.  It really is a great escape for breakfast and brunch where you truly feel you are separated from the American tourist traps.  

We came here on some pretty dreary, rainy, cold start of summer days-making the 2 mile trek from the hotel on foot to take in the sights along the way (people watching - such a pleasure in Montreal)

So, go here a lot and order everything on the menu. You will be glad you did!"}
{"text":"The Eggs Benedict was delicious!

I did not see a lot of cute breakfast places in downtown montreal.   This place has character and great food.  We had this chocolate croissant that was fantastic.  The place is a little bit if a wall from where we stayed downtown, but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"We landed on the wrong side of the breakfast rush; no bagels or croissants left. :( boo. But we'll try again tomorrow because the breakfast sandwich on 1/2 baguette is amazing. Chai latte is fantastique!"}
{"text":"Amazing egg Benedict but loses points on cleanliness and service.  Our order was wrong.  The fruit salad was moldy and there are plenty of flies all around.  Leaving ASAP."}
{"text":"For my first breakfast in Montreal I searched Yelp for a location not too far from my hotel. Based on the stellar reviews I headed over to this cafe. The wait to order was about 15 minutes but being on vacation and not in a rush the wait didn't bother me. So when I was finally able to order I ordered 2 cafe au laits, a bagel with cream cheese and a bagel with egg, cheese and bacon. The bagel with cream cheese came out just fine, however the bagel for the bagel, egg, cheese and bacon was burnt. Literally, black. So I asked for another and that one was also burnt but more dark brown with a few areas of black. As I don't like to complain, I ate it, picking off the black burnt parts of the bagel. The egg, cheese and bacon were all excellent but I'm confused as to why my bagel was burnt, twice. My bill was $16 for 2 coffees and bagel sandwiches. Yelp let me down with this place. The cafes were just ok."}
{"text":"Super cute place with very friendly service! If you need a quick breakfast sandwich, this cafe won't disappoint."}
{"text":"I really wasn't a fan of this place. We had a macchiato which was extremely bitter,  I did not enjoy it. Had french toast for breakfast,  I didn't like the hidden raisins inside it. 

Just not my favorite."}
{"text":"Their sandwiches and coffee tasted good, but it's a really small place! When I was looking for a breakfast place, this came up among the top. Yet they had very small selection, sandwiches were premade."}
{"text":"Very polite staff, delicious breakfast and adorable atmosphere. We ordered a breakfast sandwich and eggs Benedict. The eggs Benedict were exceptional and the sandwich equally as tasty."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I visited Montreal this week! We randomly stumbled upon this cafe! We ordered the TMC croissant with bacon and another with ham. AMAZING croissant I have ever tasted!!! The croissant was fresh and so were the ingredients. The TMC had hard boiled eggs, lettuce, tomatoes, cheddar cheese and house mayonnaise. 

We actually ended up going back the next day! I ordered the TMC with bacon again. The second time, my boyfriend ordered the bagel breakfast. It was a sesame seed poppy bagel with bacon, Swiss cheese, lettuce and tomatoes. The bagel was also amazing. 

The atmosphere was very intimate and clean. The service was exceptional. The presentation was very on point for a breakfast Cafe. 

I would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Double cappuccino - good! 
TMC croissant with bacon. Amazing! Flakey and delicious. The fruit saled with the mint is awesome. Amazing how the mint adds to the salad. Not overpowering.

Ham eggs Bennie. Classic eggs Bennie. Perfect in its own right. Nothing extravagant, but what you'd expect (and yummy)"}
{"text":"Had the caramel latte...best thing I've ever had. It was a frigid 5 degrees Fahrenheit and I needed to warm up. The place is cute and cozy and was a great vibe!"}
{"text":"I found this cafe via yelp...it is located in old montreal..and most breakfast cafe around the area is nice and european feel of cafe..BUT...i was kinda disappointed when i found this place..it is located within an office building..it is not really clean and has flies flying around in the cafe..i still decided to eat there was i was running out of time before my next stop..

We ordered breakfast bagel and breakfast croissant....the staff asked salad or fruit..initially i thought it came with it..but at the end we realized they charged u for that..so just be aware...

My breakfast bagel was surprisingly good! the bagel taste different from the bagels i got from the states...the texture is chewy and its size is smaller than most of the bagel sold in the states...it went well with the egg, hams, lettuces....the fruits were so GOOD!!.it is mixture of melon, pineapple, and strawberry .it was probably the sweetest fruited i have ever tasted!!..it is so GOOD!!...

I would definitely come back to this place again for its breakfast..but i gave a 4 star instead of a 5 star b/c of its environment.....it didn't provide the European feel that i was looking for"}
{"text":"Here for breakfast with my brother.  I had the english muffin with bacon egg and cheddar.  I believe he had the same.  I had a medium latte and he enjoyed a cappuccino. 

Overall, excellent.  The nice touches include the staff who are especially helpful and attentive.  We liked free wifi.  The atmosphere is casual, really casual.  Seating is a bit limited.  

Bottom line:  Will definitely be back for an easy breezy breakfast!"}
{"text":"Amazing! The best word to describe the experience, food/cappuccinos and staff. We were in town for the weekend from Toronto and looking for a quick breakfast before heading back home. The staff was incredibly welcoming and helpful with selecting options to eat. 

We would recommend their signature croissant sandwich with homemade ingredients and a side of fresh fruit salad. We paired it with easily THE BEST CAPPUCCINO we've ever had. Perfect creama consistency and the foam was thick and flavorful. No sugar needed! 

Highly, highly recommend checking this place out for a quick bite. You won't be disappointed. PS- we even grabbed another Cappuccino on the way out to the airport. Who needs Starbucks??"}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp while on a weekend trip. Outstanding service and amazing cofffee. The food was simple and tasty. Fantastic breakfast spot"}
{"text":"Almond croissant was excellent.   French toast a little too runny.  Coffee was bitter.  Person taking order was a bit stuffy and did not make the place really that inviting.  A little too French...not Montreal."}
{"text":"It's true. The TMC Croissant. Get it!!  Amazing texture and burst of flavors. One of my favorite meals in Canada, coming from a NYC tourist :)"}
{"text":"Delicious (but TINY!)
The reviews are great - I love my yelp community!
This was a hidden gem of a spot - all the reviews lay true.
Watch for the entrance to this spot - if you walk by you'll be circling trying to figure it out. The entrance is literally across the street from an alley way! Don't forget that part.
We waited in line for a solid 20 minutes before ordering.
There are only 10 tables in the joint, and you can only sit after getting a table number, you only get a table number after you order, and you only order after you've waited. Bizarre but strangely effective.

I ordered the eggs Benedict with bacon on a croissant! Genius (I thought so) as it's not on the menu but the owner was happy to oblige. (Yes I paid extra, no I didn't mind) it was worth it. My fiancé also got the Eggs Benny with bacon on a classic English muffin and said it was good - but not as good as mine.

We followed our breakfast with hot tea and a cappuccino and a chocolate croissant to go! (Order it with your breakfast or there will be none left!)

Don't go if you're starving or in a hurry - we went there for 11AM and I could tell the people waiting in line behind us were not pleased with the wait - brunching in Montreal is not the same as Toronto or Europe.

Lovely breakfast and I will definitely be back - the only thing missing was music - it was crazy silent and the space is so beautiful - it was strange not to have soft music playing in such a lovely space."}
{"text":"Best mocha I've ever had.  Frothy, silky, mmmmm.  Wonderful service and free wifi - lovely."}
{"text":"This staff at this cafe is so incredibly nice. We walked in and ordered several delicious croissants (chocolate hazelnut, almond and plain) and an egg muffin sandwich. When we got our order, one of the cashiers who may have been the manager/owner, not sure...came up to us and asked us abput our trip and if we needed any help with suggestions. He helped us figure out our day plans! We love this place! Wish they were open on Sunday. :)"}
{"text":"Great coffee, good croissant, but horrible service. Skip this place and head down to Le Cartet which is ten times better and  amazing service."}
{"text":"LOVED their latte bowls.  Food is  good to amazing.  Very chatty staff--which works well when it's not too busy.  Enjoyed it enough to come back twice in a weekend."}
{"text":"We had one of the best latte's -out of hundreds of places high end or not- was made here today.  Staff was friendly and cordial, and the food was outstanding.

We're talking about going back tomorrow in leiu of anywhere else in Montreal.  It's a little bit away from the main tourist path, but worth the extra block walk."}
{"text":"After consulting the all-knowing and all-powerful Yelp app, we decided to crush our hangover here. Mission accomplished!

First, the cafe au lait... So rich, so bold.  It was perfection in a huge cup. 

The winning moment, however, was when I took the first bite of my French Toast. It had bacon and white cheddar cheese. YES, white cheddar cheese!  I followed my server's advice and dumped all of the real maple syrup on top. After that first bite I was screaming like a giddy schoolgirl on the inside, but somehow remained stoic on the outside. I'm a pro like that.  

This place is small and unassuming, but the food is the real deal and that's why I would not hesitate to return."}
{"text":"I was in Montreal for work for few days.  During this trip I was so sick that I couldn't eat.  The only thing I could eat was their grilled cheese sandwich and wash it down with the best late.  They make even a simple sandwich look pretty on a plate.

I am looking forward to coming back with my husband on my next trip.  Few of my local friends make The Mon Café one of their regular spots and I totally get why.  The food is incredible and the service is amazing!  Even if you don't speak French, they speak English and are super nice!"}
{"text":"While staying at the W Hotel during a recent Montréal trip I needed to find a spot to hole up and knock out a few hours of work, preferably somewhere not so busy on a weekday, serving food all day with some potent caffeinated beverages. 

Alors là! The perfect breakfast/lunch work space. Friendly café staff, delicious and healthy breakfast and lunch options. I went with a panino and salad combo, delish! Plenty of cappuccinos kept me typing away for hours. The free WiFi is also incredibly consistent and reliable. Pull up a chair by the window and you can gaze out at street traffic in old MTL. Thank you Thé Mon and Yelp for leading me here!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast I've ever had...literally! This is the go to place for breakfast/brunch when staying around downtown Montreal. The menu is short but the food is delicious! Must try the Eggs Benedict!"}
{"text":"My wife & i ate breakfast here and we really loved it. We had the absolute best croissants we have ever had. Their chai tea was also, without question, the absolute best I have ever had.

The space itself is very charming & the staff extremely friendly. You really owe it to yourself to stop in and eat here."}
{"text":"I don't hate this place, i just don't need to come back.  This is a cafe with cafe fare with tourist trap prices.  Saturday brunch with a TMC croissant sandwhich that everyone has complimented.  It's a croissant sandwich any decent cafe in Mtl quality.  So better than the chain coffee shops but by MTL standards we've got better.  The cincher is the Panatone breakfast sandwhich which should say sample size $13 for half a tiny sandwhich size.  Hmm... No.  It was soggy, and tiny. 
Coffee and tea is seperate.  So our total bill for two peopleata cafewas $28 and change. Totally not worth it. 
Thanks but only if you want a coffee or tea.
*The photo I took of the Panatoast has crumbs on the plate cause I shared my croissant with him ."}
{"text":"This Cafe was a brilliant find on the outskirts of old Montreal!  As soon as we walked in we were greeted by the nicest man explaining the menu to us.  My wife and I had the croissant sandwich and French toast with fresh fruit, both were exceptional!
We also enjoyed large bowls of cafe au lait, again very tasty!  I will definitely return to this quaint little cafe the next time I visit Montreal."}
{"text":"J'ai trouvé le bagel BLT très rafraîchissant. Aussi les prix sont bons pour l'emplacement. Un endroit sympa. Bon acceuil. Je reviendrais ça c'est sûre. Je vous l'ère commande fortement si vous voulez manger a moins de 10$!!!"}
{"text":"Great little place. Came here for a quick bite, and we ordered the TMC Croissant and the French Toast. I didn't know the french toast was made from Pannattone bread (which i'm not a fan of), but it was still very well made - alot of fresh fruit on top. The TMC croissant is where it's at! Simple but delicious. Coffee was delish."}
{"text":"Cafe is adorable! I wish they had a menu we could look at though rather than a small chalkboard the server reads out loud. I ordered eggs Benedict with bacon. The eggs were delicious but the side fruit salad was not fresh and smeared with sweet syrup. I also ordered a chai latte to go and it tasted like cinnamon foamed milk."}
{"text":"Great place with good food and welcome staff. We had the TMC croissant and a fruit cookie with coffees. All were really good. The house mayonnaise is very tasty. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This was a decent place and a nice start to the day in Old Montreal.  I had a latte and a breakfast bagel with bacon, Swiss cheese and egg.  It came to around $10 total including tax.  

The latte itself was not bad.  It wasn't super amazing, but it had the right foam to coffee ratio.  As for the breakfast bagel, it was on a freshly toasted sesame bagel, had lettuce, tomatoes, Swiss cheese and an egg.  I liked the fact that you could choose between Swiss and cheddar cheese. While the ingredients were super fresh and the eggs were actual eggs (unlike a lot of places now who are just liquid egg for their sandwiches), the sandwich itself was a bit bland.  If they had a hint of ketcup, mayo, some salt or something, it could have put this sandwich over the top, but unfortunately, they didn't.  

As for the ambiance itself, it's a small cafe with about 10 seats or so but what I really liked doing was that I could sit at the window and people watch.  

Verdict: Good way to start off your morning and just people watch.  Nothing super special, but it'll do the trick."}
{"text":"We loved this place! Our concierge recommended this place and it was perfect! We both had delicious espresso, I had a flaky croissant with fresh fruit and my husband had the bacon eggs benedict. The staff was super friendly food was great. Reminded us of being back in Paris."}
{"text":"We visited on Sunday morning. The welcome is pleasant and low key.

The menu was explained to us well - it is quite limiting so we shared some fruit and had a Muffin and a croissant. Along with coffees...

The fruit was tasty, the Muffin a little too salty and the croissant with its ham, egg, cheese and tomato fillings average. The macchiato was good and the cappuccino too big...the coffee flavour so diluted.

Ok - yes but a little underwhelming."}
{"text":"We all get the TMC for a quick breakfast as well as iced cappuccino.  Just a quaint and lovely Cafe."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast.  Friendly staff.  Quick service.

The TMC croissant was amazing!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best cappuccino in Montreal. If you are in Old Montreal, take the time to stop by this great cafe. Their Eggs Benedict are also amazingly perfect."}
{"text":"Nice relaxed environment, with fast WiFi! I ordered a Sencha Kyoto tea, and it was quite lovely. The barista also let me give it a smell before brewing it just to make sure I'd like it."}
{"text":"Cute little cafe that serves good coffee drinks and has yummy pastries. The cafe is minimalistically decorated with little wood tables and bright colored chairs. They offer free wifi and there is a bathroom in the cafe. The two guys working here were so friendly and sweet. They added to the pleasurable experience of my afternoon coffee.  I chose a yummy decadent dark chocolate pastry to eat.  There's a nice variety of sweets to choose from. I believe you can also get sandwiches here as well.  It's a nice little place to stop and enjoy a cappuccino while in Old Montreal."}
{"text":"This cafe is really conveniently located near a lot of hotels, so a good option for tourists looking for a quick breakfast. 

We came here hoping to get the dejeuner sur bagel (breakfast sandwich on a bagel) but unfortunately, they were finished serving breakfast by between 11 and 11:30am. I remain pretty unclear on when they stop serving breakfast. Instead, we got two bagels toasted with cream cheese, with sides of fruit salad (as suggested by the server). The bagels were pretty decent, but one was quite burnt, which was a bummer. The fruit salad was good, though. 

We also got one coffee and one cappuccino. I didn't try the coffee, but my boyfriend seemed to like it fine. The cappuccino was excellent.

It didn't look like they had a great variety of enticing pastries or other offerings. The counter display was mostly filled with panini options.

Service was friendly and the atmosphere was nice."}
{"text":"The food is good if you get what you order.  The place is a confusing mess when it's at all busy.  You order food at the register but don't pay until you are done for some reason.  I lost count of the people who were baffled by this.  Then you have people milling around trying to pay or order.  No one who has already eaten wants to wait in the line to order. 

Then they can't seem to get orders right.  There is a difference between bacon and ham.  They even have both options on the menu.  Yet our order and a few customers around me had bacon arrive instead of the ham they ordered.  

The place is just not worth the aggravation in the morning."}
{"text":"Petit lieu bien convivial. Rien à dire juste ce qu'on veut un dimanche matin pour bruncher tranquille et pas cher."}
{"text":"Delicious! I kept hearing to try a bagel while in Montreal and I'm glad I did! Wow, it was delightful. I had a regular bagel with cream cheese, it was plain cream cheese but there was something magical about it. Also, the chai tea was good. My fiancé had the breakfast bagel which was also tasty."}
{"text":"Stayed at the the Westin and we were looking for a place close by... Read the reviews and said lets do the walk... First... Excellent service... Very accommodating to us US trackers... Food was awesome... We got the English muffin with egg and bacon and an excellent chocolate croissant ...we also asked for a glass with lemon for our soda.... Not a problem and was more than helpful to do.... Well deserved the review!!!!"}
{"text":"Simple, tasty breakfast spot.  Nice people. Really enjoyed my breakfast sandwich. Perfect quick and tasty breakfast spot before my tour."}
{"text":"Découverte intéressante. Sommes venus ici car le premier restaurant que nous sommes allés n'avait plus d'uf!?!
Sommes donc sortis et avons décidé de venir à celui-ci. Avons pris la suggestion du jour avec café latté (lait d'amande) et un croissant aux amandes. C'était délicieux. Très bon service aussi."}
{"text":"This unassuming spot was fantastic! We rec the TMC and eggs Benedict. Great coffee. Nice people. Hope to return."}
{"text":"Extremely great food and drinks. Lost a star due to being A bit pricey and so much if their menu was unavailable because they were out of ingredients. Recommend the TMC croissant and the Eggs Benedict with ham. BLT Bagel was good. Another from our party had poached eggs and toast and the eggs were done perfectly. The coffee drinks were flawless. Cappuccino was the best we have had in Montreal. If you have time check this place out. Go early so you don't have to deal with the out of stock issues on ingredients (we went at 1:00pm)."}
{"text":"The Mon Cafe is a great place to start your day! We popped in for breakfast and had delicious croissant sandwiches and a fruit salad. Who knew croissant sandwiches could be so good?? My husband claims it's the best croissant sandwich he's ever tasted. Normally, he's an idiot, but I think he's right about this one."}
{"text":"For a small and unassuming location inside an office building, this place definitely surprised me in the best way. Walking inside, I felt kind of nervous since there were no other customers and I wasn't sure if this was a joke or not. Upon ordering and receiving my food, however, I have come to the conclusion that Thé Mon Café has the best simple breakfast/brunch menu item that I've encountered so far: the TMC Croissant Sandwich.

Consisting of hard-boiled eggs, lettuce, tomato, a meat choice of ham or bacon (I chose bacon), and a cheese choice of cheddar or Swiss (I picked Swiss); the flavors just happened to meld together to create a state of heaven for my tastebuds. The freshness of the vegetables combined with the creaminess of the hard-boiled eggs, the slight saltiness of the bacon, and the butteriness of the croissant made it a perfect choice for a satisfying but not overindulgent dish. I normally hate hard-boiled eggs that come with a well-done center, but the cayenne pepper (?) that they sprinkled on top gave them an extra kick that would have made the sandwich more dull otherwise.

I also ordered a chai latte, and it had a nice, full-bodied flavor that tasted homey with a little bit of spice at the same time. The barista/cashier told me that they use actual tea leaves to make the drink instead of the powdered mix that many other places use (looking at you, Starbucks), and it certainly showed.

Thé Mon Café is a perfect place to go to if you're in Old Port and you want to wake up the right way. If you get a window seat, especially the ones in the middle, there's a cute view of the street below so you can people-watch if that's what you're into! Never judge a book by its cover because it may give you much more than you would ever expect."}
{"text":"We popped in for a quick breakfast on the way to shop and sightsee.  This personable little place will make you made to order Eggs Benedict or scrambled eggs but apparently, they are famous for croissants.  If you are gluten free (as I am) peep in the glass front case for some cut fruit and yogurt.  

My cappuccino was perfect!  Seriously, perfect. The café is not visible from the street and is up the stairs in a corner of a large building that also houses a hotel. If you are walking in Old Montreal, it's worth a stop."}
{"text":"Had excellent coffee and equally good, friendly service. The bagels were more cake-like than authentic New York-style but just as edible."}
{"text":"Tiny little cafe near the Notre Dame. I'm a big fan of the The Mon Cafe croissant or as they call it \"TMC Croissant\" . Slices of boiled egg with your choice of meat (ham, bacon) with lettuce and tomatoes and homemade dressing served on a croissant. Its available between 7 am to 11 am. They do some great lunch sandwiches too. Especially the tuna, Italian and the porchetta sandwich. But I'd visit this place especially for the TMC Croissant.

Food : Good
Service :Fast
Ambiance : Casual
Worth the price : Yes"}
{"text":"Grabbed a quick breakfast here and would definitely do so again. Very quick, friendly service - willing to put up with my miserable French. The atmosphere is bright and lively. I got the breakfast special - hard boiled eggs, ham, and tomato on a croissant - very good"}
{"text":"Awesome spot -- my friends and I happened upon this place on Saturday morning -- with no advance notice, they were able to accommodate a group of 12 people. Everything was really tasty as well. I had the bacon benedict -- very highly recommended."}
{"text":"Just had a great little breakfast here.

I'm not much of a coffee expert but me and the Mrs. both enjoyed our cappuccino and mochas.

Breakfast was a croissant TMC, fruit salad, spiced hash browns, French toast 

Sandwich was great, yes very simple but the buttery croissant doesn't need much

Well worth the 3 minute walk from my Westin hotel where they are charging $22 for a tiny generic plate with no cappuccino"}
{"text":"Quaint little place that offers a small selection of delicious brunch and lunch options. We jointly had the bacon Benedict, the ham Benedict,  a dirty Chai latte,  a chocolate crossiant and an orange juice... 

Everything is reasonably priced and the food is quite delicious and cooked from scratch.. The Benedict was cooked perfectly with the egg really runny.  The hollandaise sauce was one of the better ones I've had too. It comes with a side of fruit which is really really fresh. 
The chocolate crossiant was really good,  but as flaky as expecting but the chocolate flavor with nuts added a nice flavor. 

Once again,  which is becoming a Canadian norm,  the service was really really nice and enjoyable."}
{"text":"What a great little gem!  Don't be fooled when you walk in--it's very small and European.  The barista was extremely nice and informative about their specialty breakfast sandwich (TMC).  The sandwich was delicious and the coffee was great.  Quick service.  Would definitely return on my next trip to Montreal."}
{"text":"This is truly a hidden gem. The yelp reviews were pretty convincing so we decided to give this spot a try. It's a definite winner! It was recommended that we try the \"Croissant TMC\" which is essentially an open face breakfast BLT. It includes sliced hard boiled eggs, Swiss cheese, choice of bacon or ham and lettuce with tomato of course. We were blown away! The croissant was baked to perfection with a flaky buttery crust. We savored every bite. 
To top things off, we were offered complimentary coffee that was also delish (but don't expect that when u get here)
In summary, this place comes highly recommended. It's a must try if you're in Vieux Montréal."}
{"text":"The TMC croissant with ham and cheese was fantastic.  The coffee mocha was one of the best I've ever had and the lattes were outstanding.  They did not have a booster chair but were very accommodating to our 15 month old grandson."}
{"text":"My husband and I took our 5 and 3 year old today. They could not have been nicer and we're great at explaining the menu. I had the egg and cheese sandwich on a bagel and my husband had the TMC sandwich. It was beyond tasty and filled us up without being heavy. Our kids had the muffins which were amazing. The lattes were exquisite. An all around wonderful experience for our first breakfast in Montreal."}
{"text":"The TMC croissant is delicious and the moka is perfectly prepared. This place is a must stop for a quick bite!"}
{"text":"Good coffee.  Came a little late (11am) and most of the good pastries were gone.  Heavy volume traffic on a Sunday-- expect a wait for food and coffee.  Cute shop with friendly workers."}
{"text":"I had the BEST (ever!!) Eggs Benedict here today! Wow, so  fresh and the hollandaise sauce was absolute perfection! It is a really tiny place (with one person working the front and another cooking in the back but for the lovely meal I had, I would totally go back and wait if I needed to!!"}
{"text":"It was a decent place to have breakfast in the neighbourhood. However, other than their warm chocolate croissant, everything was just okay. We got latte, croissant sandwiches (with bacon or ham, sliced boiled eggs, lettuce and tomato) and chocolate croissant for dessert. Coffee was bitter as well. 
The owner was really nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Visited with a fairly large group of people for breakfast. The service was great, and the food was delicious! The chocolate croissant was incredible, and the BLT bagel really hit the spot."}
{"text":"Very friendly place--made us tourists feel very welcome. Tasty food and excellent selection of fine teas."}
{"text":"Sadly missed breakfast by 10mins or so (I was so looking forward to trying Le Croissant TMC thats been getting such rave reviews) Instead ordered the grilled cheese sandwich served with house-made (mom-made) apple gelee - PHENOMENAL! Hands down the BEST grilled cheese Ive ever had. In addition to the good coffee & great service, I look forward to returning here on my next visit :)
so, So, SO GOOD!"}
{"text":"Ordered the TMC breakfast sandwich and was pleasantly surprised. At first I was a little turned off with the egg being a sliced hard boiled egg but it was amazing. The mayo was homemade. The staff working that day was very friendly and funny. When the cook brought our food over he stayed and talked to us for a while. Great coffee! Will come back if I'm ever in Montreal again."}
{"text":"What a tasty little cafe. The wife and I grabbed a quick breakfast here. It is very small inside, but the croissant sandwiches were delicious, and the fruit was very fresh...which was a pleasant surprise given that it was November. The coffee was perfectly crafted and was the perfect start to a morning exploring Montreal. Absolutely give this place a try if you find yourself in Old Montreal."}
{"text":"Came here because I read some great reviews on it but to be honest, it was underwhelming. First off they did not have smoked salmon bagel which was what I was looking for but I ended up getting the BLT bagel which like I stated before was underwhelming. It is a nice little shop but don't expect too much from it."}
{"text":"This is a nice little cafe with great service. Has a homie feel. Deff recommend if you are in the city... The people won't let you down..."}
{"text":"Great little cafe on the skirts of the old port. Friendly bilingual staff gets a 5/5- food and coffee is just perfect!"}
{"text":"We dropped by this cafe after a long bus ride. The cafes environment was pleasant and the server was patient even when we had 8 people coming in at once. 

The food was not too bad but fresh at least. I definitely enjoyed it. I recommend getting the bagel BLT with egg or whatever added on."}
{"text":"Great small little cafe. Up for a weekend trip and staying in a hotel near the Basillica of Notre Dame and needed a quick breakfast. Stopped in and had an excellent breakfast sandwich. Coffee and teas were excellent too. Conveniently located, very friendly and helpful staff for us American speaking tourists

Would recommend"}
{"text":"Best cappuccino I had in Montreal. Hands down. Made sure to come here right before I left for the airport!"}
{"text":"Nice place. Coffee is good and reasonably priced.  Good place to get some coffee and use the wifi."}
{"text":"Croissant with ham, cheese, lettuce, egg,.. Was really good. Tea was nice as well. Staff was not friendly."}
{"text":"I visited Montreal for a few days and this cafe was a brief walk from the hotel. The bagels, the croissants, the coffee, the chai latte are absolutely delicious! This a cute little cafe and perfect for breakfast."}
{"text":"Simple food. Nice service. I had croissant sandwich, orange juice and an americano with ice for breakfast. I went there twice. They don't have ice coffee. In the same region I prefer Differance Cafe."}
{"text":"This was our first stop during our two day trip to Montreal.  I wanted their much loved TMC croissant but we got there at 11:30, half an hour after the cut-off time. Bummer. My wife asked them what was in the croissant and the guy behind the counter said they put stuff inside the croissant and then magic happens. Dammit I wanted to see a magic show.

So we were wondering if we should eat there or go somewhere else but judging from the growing lunch crowd and the smell coming out of the back, we decided to trust our senses and stay. Le wife was unsure about eating pre-made sandwiches but she was soon singing a different song.

Her roast beef sandwich came with tender, flavorful, medium rare roast beef. My porchetta sandwich was no different. The pochetta didn't have annoying, hard chunky pieces of pork like I've sometimes come across. Instead, it was almost like a cubano and even had sliced pickles. There was arugula and swiss cheese on both sandwiches, all held together by excellent bread that, if not made in house, would be shocking, They both tasted like they were made fresh. I suppose that was the advantage of going at 11:30.

They also had free wifi. After we finished, we were standing right outside, yelping and planning our next move.  The friendly owner/chef saw us, came over and started talking to us. He gave us some good pointers on where else to go besides the regular places that most people go to. Great guy.

Next time I'm in Montreal, I'll be sure to come here before 11."}
{"text":"I am from Boston and decided to drive up to Montréal with my boyfriend for a short spring break trip. In just two days we quickly discovered that despite the quiet charm of Old Montréal we ran into one problem - because it is winter most restaurants and cafés close earlier than we are used to with the exception of some late night pubs, pizza places, and Five Guys. On our last morning, we both got up early for the long drive back before the Nor'easter hits New England and stumbled upon this café. Since we were out of our hostel at 7:00 AM on a Monday I was skeptical about what we might find. On the outside, Thé Mon Café is unassuming and if you didn't know it was here you might not even think to step inside. But we were warmly greeted and the daily specials were read out to us; I decided upon an english muffin breakfast sandwich with a hot latté and he had a hot mocha with a croissant breakfast sandwich. Service was quick and our meals were brought over to us, something i am not used to, coming from Boston. We left happy and I was proud that I chose this place as our last stop in Montréal. Overall it made me happy that it was reliable and eased the stress of the odd hours that eateries are open in the city during winter."}
{"text":"We were pretty disappointed in this place after reading such rave reviews. The food and coffee were fine -- nothing special, but not bad. Maybe this is only a problem on Sunday mornings, but the service was unbelievably slow. Don't go here if you are at all in a hurry or just want to grab a quick pastry and coffee."}
{"text":"Loved the croissant sandwich. However, the coffee is just okay."}
{"text":"Great for a light breakfast. Best latte in Montreal so far for me and best cup of tea for my wife. Hot and loose tea in a filter."}
{"text":"It's a cute place and the staff are friendly. 
But I probably will not go back unless everything else is closed in the neighbourhood. 
Nothing too too special. 
Coffee and food were OKAY. 
Again, if you are in the neighbourhood, it's not a bad place to grab a quick bite. 
But I won't travel a long distance to try the food here."}
{"text":"We loved our breakfast here. So fresh and flavorful! Coffee was excellent and that's coming from a NY coffee snob."}
{"text":"Just eat here. Never in my life have I met a croissant like the one I eat here. The hit cocoa and brownies are fresh and delightful, especially on a Rainey morning. This cafe made me very happy."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick breakfast and coffee during a visit to Montreal not too long ago.

It was a bit later on a weekday morning, probably around 11:00am or so. The Mon Cafe was pretty empty, and I was able to place my order within moments.

I had the famous Montreal bagel, with a coffee as well. Pretty standard fare, although it would be nice to see the choices dressed up a bit. I was underwhelmed by the presentation and the value for what I was paying for. A small plate with just the bagel and a tiny cup of coffee. 

I'd go back, but I'm in no rush. The food was good. Service was fine. But I didn't see much value."}
{"text":"A quaint little spot around the corner from the Westin. The proprietor was amazingly nice and the cafe latte perfect. My husband had the latte as well but with an extra shot which he said was spot on. The owner gave my husband some tips on making the perfect latte. We had breakfast sandwiches on croissants which were delish."}
{"text":"Decent place to have breakfast and lunch in the area. Food is tasty and coffee well poured. Service is friendly."}
{"text":"Found this little gem via yelp and our concierge also recommended it. Very nice atmosphere, little cafe, similar to something in Europe but without the view. We did see a horse and carriage roll by but maybe because it's a Sunday there wasn't much else going on to see.
I had the eggs Benedict (one of their specials of the day) which was cooked perfectly. The hollandaise which I asked for on the side was very good as well. It was served with diced fresh fruit, pineapple, melon, strawberries etc. 
The espresso was perfect and I was even asked if I wanted a long or short pull. We make them at home with long pulls and it was great to be asked that here.
My wife had a croissant with fruit and espresso and enjoyed it thoroughly as well.
The staff was very friendly too."}
{"text":"Attention Yelpers! My advice is simple: Go here. 

Staying nearby and desperately craving some early morning grub, this place has satiated my needs and then some a couple days running now. The bagels are fresh, yummy and oh-so-sesame. The breakfast sandwiches are delicious. 

But what will convince you to come back morning after morning are their creative and yummy croissants. Try the hazelnut chocolate and enjoy a few moments of scrumptious gluttony with your coffee.

I also have to add that the service behind the counter is superb. The chef himself also came out behind the counter both mornings to check how things were! Love it!"}
{"text":"A small cafe to have a rest or relax a bit. We had a macchiato and espresso on ice. Chinese owner was nice"}
{"text":"Small breakfast menu, but who needs a long list of options when you can get the TLC breakfast sandwich! Everything you could want on a breakfast croissant. Really friendly staff."}
{"text":"An unassuming little spot with delicious food and friendly staff. My husband had the TML and I  had a BLT, both on croissants. They were so good we had to try the raspberry tart, which was amazing! Also had an espresso and a mocha iced coffee. Put Starbucks to shame. They used cold brew and cacao and it was the perfect blend and sweetness. Hope to return before leaving Montreal."}
{"text":"Some of the best coffee in the area, and the soup I'm eating right now is AMAZING. Very quiet little place. I don't want to post this review because I feel like this place is a secret... But they deserve the business."}
{"text":"A great place to relax and grab some simple comfort food.  Exceptionally attentive and friendly staff.  Roast beef panini was amazing."}
{"text":"Popped in for brekkie after looking these guys up on Yelp. Signature breakfast highly recommended - croissant, Swiss cheese, tomato, boiled egg and lettuce - yum!!!"}
{"text":"Cool place. Serving authentic French breakfast. The coffee was amazing. And the croissant sandwich is the best of its kind I've had. Yum! Plus not to forget the almond croissant that puts your brain to indulge in the subtleties of the taste. 
The decor brought memories from Europe and the people in it are the most helpful as ever. 
Definitely up for a treat in downtown Montreal."}
{"text":"TMC Croissant with ham was delicious.  The croissant was a bit dry, but still very good.  Coffee was delicious and service was great.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Nice small place, but with very good breakfast and they serve a very good coffee! 
I had the tmc croissant and I liked it very much"}
{"text":"Nice staff, not that busy place but warm and quiet, breakfast available , coffees , chai latté etc. I like it in the middle of tourist expensif places around .."}
{"text":"A good place for brunch that offers good selection and delicious food. We ordered the eggs benedict with bacon and the eggs benedict with ham and a latte. The eggs benedicts were delicious and the fruit cup that comes with it was good. The prices are very reasonably priced. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The only thing is when we arrived at noon, they had limited selection of food left. Also, I liked the food and the crossiant I had a lot, but I've had better. But for the price and food, I would come again for a quick brunch."}
