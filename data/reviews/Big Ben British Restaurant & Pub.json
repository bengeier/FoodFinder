{"text":"My wife and I went for lunch. We had been before for breakfast and it was pleasant. This time it was bad as soon as the waitress appeared. She appeared very disinterested in us. We asked about the salad dressings and we were told she thought they had the normal stuff other places have. Great answer!! My wife asked if any were made in house? She said she doubted it. That set the tone and we asked to speak to a manager. The hostess came to speak to us and she was very pleasant and apologetic and embarrassed by our server. We asked for another waiter and it suddenly became respectful and enjoyable. Towards the end of our meal the owner arrived and approached our table to ask if everything was ok. We told her about the experience and she offered a half baked apology. We proceeded to over tip our new waiter just to prove a point. The actual point is we'll never, ever visit again!!"}
{"text":"The food is a little overpriced and the beer is as well.  The best thing about this place is a guy that plays music here on Thursdays."}
{"text":"Busy Sunday, but only two people working. Atmosphere is nice and bar like, but the food was not that good.  I would cone back for drinks or to watch a match, but not for the food."}
{"text":"First time at the new location and it just didn't feel right.  Didn't have the same atmosphere.  Staff had limited knowledge about the English beers it was serving.  Food was good, nothing amazing but definately what I was looking for a cold day."}
{"text":"We didn't enjoy it at all. None of our food had any real flavor. It was disappointing and we won't be back. It was so hot inside that we had to move to a table outside b/c you couldn't breath in the building."}
{"text":"This is one of our family favorites. Great atmosphere and staff.  I took my staff there for a meeting and now they are all regulars.  The shepherds pie is delicious and they also have cottage pie if you don't like lamb.  Ask for extra chutney with the Scottish eggs.  Don't miss out on the daily specials or the bread pudding."}
{"text":"We love Big Ben's!   My husband and I started going to Big Ben's two months ago and fell in love.  The atmosphere is great, nice and relaxing.  The servers are friendly and timely.  We love to go on nights that they have live music.  Hubby's favorite is the Meat pies, they are rich and filling.  I have had several dishes and I have liked them all.  Looking forward to our next visit, I am going to try the fish and chips!"}
{"text":"Fish, chips, and a wally.  Let's be honest, the British aren't really known for their outstanding cuisine.  Having written that, the meal I chose (fried haddock sammy with steak fries and a pickle) was pretty decent.  The tartar sauce was thicker than normal tartar and made the meal.  Good stuff.  My coworker tried a turkey wrap that he said was good but not great.  For a lunch venue, it's not bad.  We had efficient and friendly service.  We were in an out fairly quick.  Prices were reasonable for the Dilworth/SouthEnd area.  Their beer list looked great.  If I go back, and I probably will, I'd go back for happy hour instead of lunch."}
{"text":"Being British, I was excited to find an authentic British pub in Charlotte!  The food and drink are very authentic, they even have Manchester based Boddingtons on tap!  The fish and chips with mushy peas are excellent!"}
{"text":"Excellent authentic British Food!  Took my English father there for his birthday.  He absolutely loved it.  Fish and chops are top notch, and the steak and kidney pie is better than me Mum used to make.  Also a good spot for drinks after work with the mates."}
{"text":"I've been visiting Big Ben every week for well over a year and a half, as they were gracious enough to take in Bob Bair and the Tuesday trivia folks (they should still be thanking RiRa for that).  Food- funny, folks say that British food is boring and bland.  If that is the case, then BB is not authentic, because everything is DELICIOUS!  I've had just about everything on the menu- from a burger to pasty to the Sunday roast, and it has all been excellent.  They also have various entrees featured as monthly specials, and sometimes I wish a few of them would make the regular menu.  Fish and chips are lovely, though I have not had them (I do not eat fish), but everyone that I know that has had them has always liked them.  Beer- BB has a decent beer selection, many are pub favorites.  They also have some decent specials throughout the week.  However, I'm withholding a star for one reason: the beer list needs some updating.  I am so sick of the same old beers that have been on the menu since this new location opened.  I'd like to see some variety...see some taps rotate every now and then.  There is this huge craft beer market out there, and in this neighborhood, you have got to be able to keep up!  It's gotten to the point where I hardly order a beer anymore because the options are so exhausted (Fat Tire, Stella, Guinness...).  If rotating out taps won't work, at least rotate some bottle selections.  :)  PS- \"Newcastle IPA\" does not count.  Service- Typically quite good.  The only spot where they struggle is when there has been some turnover.  Probably would be a good idea to partner a newbie with a seasoned server (or at least have the seasoned server check up on the table), as it gets a little frustrating.  The rest of the team is awesome, namely: Lucky, Angie, and Laura (? Bubbly brunette, maybe I got her name wrong??). We rarely sit at the bar but I do recognize the long haired bartender, he's been there for ages, and he has always been nice.  Other pros- location...next to the light rail.  Prices are fair!  Desserts are scrumptious. I also am a big fan of their breakfast (wish it was offered on Tuesday nights...).  Big Ben is also an excellent place to watch any and all soccer matches (EPL, UEFA, World Cup, Euros, you name it).  Make a reservation for the big matches, as the place gets packed!!"}
{"text":"We went to Big Ben's for breakfast on a Saturday morning. Walked in at 8:52, expecting to grab a seat and a cup of coffee until the staff was fully ready to serve (they officially open at 9, but the doors were open when we walked up at 8:52). When we entered, m the bartender was standing near the entrance, loudly cursing someone on the phone. He turns to us, and says 'we're not open, you will need to come back at 9'.....needless to say, we took our business elsewhere."}
{"text":"We haven't been here for awhile ,so we decided to stop in. I have to say I was extremely disappointed. I ordered the Steak Diane and it was over cooked and the vegetables were rubbery. Potatos were dry too. The waiter asked if I wanted to send it back, but I declined because of the wait. My mistake!!! They still charged me  $20...... even after it was obvious I wasn't going to eat it. Poor service guys!"}
{"text":"This is the first time I have been to this place and I really enjoyed myself.  It was crowded, but the Champions league final between Barcelona and Juventus was on.  Great atmosphere and the food was good.  I had the roasted lamb and it was very good.  The meat was tender and the gravy was very tasty.  Newcastle was the $4.50 20oz pour and it was good.  Going on a day like today the service was ok, but with it being so crowded it was what I expected.  Fun place to go to watched the games. If your in the area I recommend you stopping by to give this place a try."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! Best fish n chips EVER!! Great atmosphere and staff is always so nice! If you order Shepard's pie it always takes longer to bake and be ready but seriously, Fish and chips is way to go!"}
{"text":"after more than a dozen visits to Big Ben, i felt it was time to spread the gospel. my most recent trip was on 7.2.15 and it did not disappoint. the haddock n' chips was perfect. piping hot, but not dangerous. the breading was light and crispy, not too greasy.the haddock was well cooked, moist, and perfectly seasoned. the chips were great as well. i also enjoyed the cole slaw (although i was too full to finish it). i rarely drink alcohol with a meal, but big ben has Spaten on tap (around $5/pint) and it is the perfect companion beverage for haddock n' chips. the staff was excellent. our server (michael) was attentive without being a bother. we were offered refills exactly when we needed them and were politely offered the dessert menu(which we declined-we were stuffed) after we finished our meals. my meal was $13.95- a steal when you consider the large portion and high quality and flavor. i will return...OFTEN!"}
{"text":"All I wanted was a meat pie... Get your minds out of the gutter. Looking for a good British beer and some good eats. Sadly neither was had on this occasion. Tried to find a seat at the bar but it was full. No worries. Outside seating it is. Quite a large patio, nice seating but sadly next to the tracks. No biggie though. And then we waited... and waited... and waited. Finally we gave up. No water. No server. Though there was a friendly gentleman that was closing up the patio that said \"thank you, have a good night\". Not sure what he was thanking me for though. So no meat and no beer but yet no more appetite for the Brits."}
{"text":"Visited for the first time last evening (8/12/15). I was underwhelmed with the service--- it took 20 minutes to get a vodka with lime - only to find out they didn't have lime juice!! Then requested a vodka ginger-- ginger ale was flat so sent it back for a vodka tonic... Apparently the bartender moonlights as a comedian so I was served a rocks glass of tonic and another shot glass of vodka- to mix myself! No Bueno!  We were with a party of maybe 8 but we'd all arrived at different times so we ordered separately -- it took my husband and I about 25 minutes to get our bangers &smash and Shepards Pie. --- both were DELICIOUS!!!   In all, the food was great but the service leaves a lot to be desired- particularly the bartender. He was rude and not personable at all!"}
{"text":"What better day than a cold rainy one to try out a British Pub for breakfast, besides it is convenient to the Atheron Mill farmers market. My wife and I were both pleasantly surprised. Both of us had the Hearty breakfast plate. While not exactly cheap at $10.00, it is quite filling and tasty, consisting of 2 eggs, bacon, beans, grilled tomato and mushrooms, and let's not forget the banger ( sausage) and toast. The eggs were actually served as ordered ( over easy) banger (sausage) was flavorful,  and the bacon was meaty, closer to a Canadian bacon. If you are looking for a breakfast with southern biscuits or pancakes this is not the place for you. If you are looking for something a little different then consider this as a possibility.    Our server took our orders and kept our drinks topped off, brought out condiments without being asked. so gets 4 of 5 stars here as well, hard to believe only three tables occupied .All in all worth the dollar or two more than an ihop or denny's."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today. I had never visited the old location, but I'm glad to see the restaurant is back and in a great new location. There was soccer on the big screen, and cold beer on tap. Really enjoyed my fish and chips, but for an \"authentic\" British Pub, I was disappointed that I couldn't substitute mushy peas (a $3 side item) for cole slaw (also a $3 side item) for my entree. I've had mushy peas with my fish and chips all over London. I've never been served cole slaw with them in the UK before. They seriously ought to consider giving you an option. They take so many steps to seem authentic, but they totally blow it by not allowing authentic sides with the fish and chips.  Still, service was good. We'll be back. Hopefully they'll get it together on offering fish and chips with mushy peas, the way you'd really get it in London."}
{"text":"Horrible service.  We were disappointed as this was our first visit to their new location in the South End after the first location was closed due to a fire.  After entering and waiting 5 minutes by the door, no one bothered to seat us.  There were soccer matches on the TVs and the wait staff was more preoccupied with watching the matches than serving their customers.  Finally, we just sat down at a table. After another 10 minutes an elderly gentleman, the proprietor I suspect, waddled over to our table with about 3 TV remotes.  He never even acknowledged us, but rather, adjusted the large TV located directly above us and waddled back into oblivion.  No other wait staff came over even after I waved and made direct eye contact.  The new location is also very cramped and hard to move around in.  The original location had very much a \"pub feel\".  The new location reminds one of an overcrowded, generic sports bar and has the service to match.  Never going back."}
{"text":"Went for a get together here on a Saturday recently and ordered their fish-n-chips which was a large portion of fried haddock resting on steak fries with a side of cole slaw all on the same plate.  It was well prepared and a generous amount of food for $13.  I can't complain.  Menu has ample choices of traditional British fare including Shepherd's Pie, Bangers(sausage links) and Mash, Steak&Kidney Pie, Chicken Curry, lamb and roast beef platters. Breakfast, dessert, and kids menus as well.  Good service from two servers who kept tabs on us till closing, live music, and $10 top shelf shots made for a fun night.  It's worth a look."}
{"text":"I have to tell you I love the ambience of the space here and the appetizers are to die for!  I have had the steak Diane as well as the Shepard pie which are to die for but stay away from the chicken curry if you are looking for flavor. They do serve the drinks on the heavy side if that is of interest to you.  The outdoor patio is awesome especially when the light rail comes by.  You think you are in the \"city\". Normally the bubble and squeak is good but this time it was like mashed potatoes barely fried."}
{"text":"So first up I am British and living in Charlotte this is always going to be my go to place for a taste of home, yes I wish the menu had more of a British feel but that said this really is a great pub and i have been coming here for nearly three years now.  They do a great fish and Chips probably the best in Charlotte and I highly recommend trying it, their pies are also pretty close to what I am used to, Breakfast does need a little work as does the Sunday lunch and if they improved these i would eat here a lot more, I recommend getting the Crispin its a great Cider and one of the few places in Charlotte to have it on tap.  Yes service can be a little bit and miss but they always fix any issues and there are some great people working there Michael is a top guy and super friendly."}
{"text":"I've missed Big Ben's.  The old Big Ben's was one of our perennial favorites. We gazed sadly upon the charred timbers on Providence Road and wondered if we'd ever see the like in Charlotte again.  Well, the answer is yes and no.  I am happy to report that Big Ben's is alive and well at Atherton Mills.  Enter from Tremont and you won't miss it.  Enter from South Bl. and you won't find it.  The big 2000 above the door is misleading. B.B. is through the zig-zig corridor and out the other side of the building. And don't trip over the carpenters.  Meanwhile, back at Big Ben's.  Part of Big Ben's charm was the cozy atmosphere. Well, that's gone up in smoke.  Now, it's a cavernous room with a ceiling about three stories up. Cozy is no longer an apt descriptor.  Also missing is the fireplace. Instead is a fake fireplace with light show flames and coals, and an electric space heater, but the mantle is nice. I've seen it advertised on TV, lovingly hand-crafted by real Amish type workerpersons.  (*Sigh!*)  The menu is pretty much the same. I had a Pasty and my wife had her fave -- Liver and Onions.  Both were delicious as usual. I'm happy to report that the menu survived the fire. Rita's order arrived according to her exact specifications, so the kitchen staff is still on the ball. Our waiter was pleasant, attentive, and kept us happy by not hovering.  Over the years, we've ordered about everything on the menu, so if our visit this time in any indication, you can safely order anything they offer and reasonably expect to be well fed on their typical British fare.  For suggestions, I'd suggest you experiment with the menu offerings. But don't order the fries. Get the homemade potato chips instead. They're good enough to order extra to take home. Don't nuke 'em. Reheat then in the oven, instead. Yummy!  The steaks are really good, but you can get good steaks all over town. Instead get the Lord's Roast Lamb or Haddock and Chips. Save the steaks until you've tried the other menu items.  You can make a meal from the appetizers. Ploughman's Platter or Welsh Rarebit are good places to start.  Why only three stars? I miss the old place. If you've never been to the old Big Ben's on Providence Rd., go ahead and give it another star.  But I'd've put in a balcony or something to bring the ceiling down to give the place a more cozy atmosphere. And lose the fake fireplace."}
{"text":"We had a great experience the last couple of times during our visits but this time not so much. It was not crowded for a late afternoon and the service was just so-so, I think our waitress was more concerned with eating then she was with serving.   Food was good except our Bubbles & Squeak was served with nadty dirty lettuce for a garnish."}
{"text":"Awesome little British pub.   Great selection of beers and lovely selection of British foods."}
{"text":"When we arrived only a few tables were taken, but unknown to us, a Chelsea vs. Manchester City soccer match was about to start and the place was buzzing with people within 15 minutes. We started with the Bubble & Squeak appetizer. This traditional English dish consists of mashed potatoes and sautéed Brussels sprouts, but here they substituted cabbage. The dish had a great consistency and was very tasty. For our meal, my wife went with the Famous South-end Haddock N' Chips and I took our waiter's suggestion, the Chicken Pot Pie.   The Chicken Pot Pie was definitely a unique dish. Rather than the traditional pot pie served in some universal type of container, this pot pie was formed inside of an exceptional puff pastry type shell which held in all of the goodness of the dish. It was served with fluffy mashed potatoes, fresh steamed vegetables, and topped with chicken gravy.   The Haddock N' Chips was far larger than most persons could eat at one sitting. Luckily, my wife was willing to share. It consisted of flaky haddock, cooked to perfection, crispy pub fries, Cole slaw, and a pickle that they call a Wally which in England means a \"dill pickled baby cucumber\". The fish was great, not greasy nor overly fishy. The pub fries were cooked flawlessly, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside and the average Cole slaw complemented the dish.  So, our takeaway...if you're not a soccer fan, ask to be seated outside the viewing area of the huge screen or you'll feel like you're at the game. And go early. We snagged a parking spot right in front, but when we left, vehicles were lined up, circling. Oh, and if you like a coffee after your meals, be sure to stop in Not Just Coffee, located on the back side of Icehouse right next door and wander around the indoor farmer's market.  I would rate this establishment 5 spoons out of 5 for a family friendly restaurant serving outstanding food.  The restaurant was reviewed by Food Blogger Ernie Hiers in his series \"Excited about Eating\".

{"text":"We moved across the street 4 months ago and have been trying to make this bar our new home.  The bar is okay but the service sucks!  They don't care about their clients but rather care about hanging out with other staff members more than service.  They are slow, forget your requests and the managers couldn't care less. The bartenders and servers are great, but they can't do anything without the owners and managers support.  We are not going back after giving this place 6 chances and trying extremely hard to make it our new hangout.  They need a ton of management support, and the wait staff sucks! Cross the street and try Tyber creek or all american pub where the environment is more upbeat, positive and they care about their customers."}
{"text":"I had dinner here on Friday and was quite pleased with the atmosphere and the food. My cousin and I each got the Haddock Sandwich and it far exceeded my expectations. The batter was perfectly done on the outside making for a crunch sought after by many sub-par establishments. With two large pieces of fish overflowing off of a kaiser and a side of steak fries this was plenty and the price suited the portion. My girlfriend went with the Cottage Pie which I had never heard of but it appears to be almost identical to a Shepherd's Pie without lamb. I can't imagine there being much of a difference other than the price but then again I've never been a huge fan of lamb. Again, this Cottage Pie was a great portion for the price.  Our waiter was very attentive throughout the entire meal and was quick to make sure we were kept well-hydrated (with beer). What appeared to be the manager kept making rounds to each of the tables and was genuine in the way he asked each group if everything was okay etc. It helped that there was a great band playing some great music although the volume could have been a tad lower (to be fair it wasn't really dinner time, we got there pretty late).  Overall I was very happy here and very happy with both the Haddock Sandwich and Cottage Pie selections. Next time I'm going to have a hard time making an alternate selection since I was so happy with the sandwich. It helps too that this place is walking distance to many other spots (including my house) such as Ice House and Tyber Creek for those looking to check out a few other places after giving some English fare a go."}
{"text":"Go to place for a great beer and comfort food. Come hungry! Great atmosphere. Good drink prices! And a fireplace!"}
{"text":"Oh how I miss the old Big Ben.  No more pets allowed on the patio.  No old house charm.  Service went down the toilet at the new one, we had to wait 45 minutes just to order our drinks on a Sunday afternoon, if we hadn't of been there with out of town family & gone there specifically to watch the Arsenal match we would have left.  On top of the slow as molasses service our food was awful.  Sticking to RiRa & Valhalla to watch matches and eat English breakfasts."}
{"text":"Nice experience at a good pub... The atmosphere perfectly comes across as an English pub.  The food is a little bland, and that might be fine for many. With the Haddock, it was well prepared and this is to say the moisture of the fish and the breading and frying process can be tricky. These guys were on point and the delivery and presentation was very good to excellent (as pictured). The fish was fresh and the fry was crispy. In all, it was a nice experience and I will definitely be back to have the haddock and chips again and explore the menu more. On a final note, seeing some of the other plates coming out of the kitchen looked very good too"}
{"text":"Best fish and chips in town for sure. Unlike some of the other reviewers I actually like the atmosphere of the new place better. Maybe it's because I remember the old place when smoking was allowed at the bar. Regardless, I would highly recommend this for anyone interested in British Pub fare. The live music is a huge plus as well on the weekends."}
{"text":"The food here is a bit average. I got the shepherd's pie, and it was as expected. Pretty good tasty but nothing special. The fries here leave something to be desired. The atmosphere is pretty good though."}
{"text":"My fiancée was getting her hair styled next door, so I stopped in for a few beers to keep myself entertained while waiting for her. Charlie was bartending and was very friendly. No one bothered me as I played UNO on my phone and drank my beer. At one point, I cashed out to go meet her stylist. When I came back, Charlie remembered me and the beer I had been drinking.  The décor was decent and it was amusing to watch a replay of the Winter Olympics from the viewpoint of the UK. I would not make a special trip to Big Ben, but I would definitely stop in again if I am in the area and looking for a beer."}
{"text":"Our first time proved to be a very good experience and we will be back!  I had The Lord,s Roast Beef and the hubbie had Fish & Chips. Both were excellent and looking forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"I ordered the fish and chips... the fish was HUGE!!!!  And delicious. The server was super fast with our orders, World Cup was on and everyone was there for it. Great crowd!!!"}
{"text":"Great place, pleasent atmosphere and a nice food selection. This place aslo offers some good daily food and drinks specials.  So far the food items I have tried has been good and the portions are generous."}
{"text":"Unique little bar in south end. Usually a low key, quieter place with nice bartenders. 1/2 price bottles of wine on Wednesdays!"}
{"text":"I read the other reviews and realise that I probably chose the wrong dish. But the shepherd's pie was awful, too much mash and very little meat. Shame because what little meat was there was tasty. My company's salad looked unappetizing but she said it was OK, not great but OK. Going there early on a Monday evening was also a mistake almost empty and so the lack of ambiance was way too apparent. Anyway fish and chips on Friday night is propably a good bet."}
{"text":"Stopped in here and sat outside during a weeknight because we live nearby and it always has people. The service was in the top worst experiences I've had in the area and it took over an hour to get a quick bite. The sodas were flat and the fish and chips was a huge piece of fish that was super greasy and mostly fried batter or the skin side of the fish. Won't be coming back here!"}
{"text":"First time here, I've driven past a few times but never had the time to stop in. So when some friends suggested we grab dinner here I was excited to try something new.   Sure, it's a small place but it's packed with tons of character.   For dinner, I kept it classic and went with the fish and chips. The fish was crispy and perfectly flaky and the fries dipped in vinegar (don't knock it until you try it) were the perfect compliment.   Overall, it was an excellent meal and I'd be happy to return!"}
{"text":"Wow!! Second time passing through Charlotte and stopped here for great food. The wings, Ploughman's Lunch was great...large portion and well worth the price.  The two guys I was with liked the food also. One had chicken pot pie and the other had the two Cornish pasty and sautéed mushrooms.  I would definitely recommend this pub and whenever I pass through Charlotte I will stop here for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Best English or Irish breakfast in Charlotte! And excellent Bloody Mary's as well."}
{"text":"Easygoing crowd, casual atmosphere.  Lots of room, slow but reliable service.  You can run a tab without a minimum.  Parking in their lot or even street parking is relatively easy.  Great for large groups.  Huge beer selection.  Poor whiskey selection.  The chips (french fries) are a hearty appetizer.  I can't vouch for the rest of the food menu but my friends say it's great.  I'll definitely be back!  My only complaint is about the bathrooms.  The men's room floor is where they store beer kegs, so it's an obstacle course every time you must relieve yourself.  And there are no curtains on the window, so you can wave (with your free hand) and make faces at people as you are obviously standing in front of the urinal while guests get in and out of their cars in the parking lot. WTF?"}
{"text":"Food is good and wait staff was very good. I eat here for lunch when I am in the mood for good British food at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Best place in town to watch World Cup! They open as early as six a.m. for matches. Scotch eggs and Guinness for breakfast!"}
{"text":"I really liked the atmosphere here. I had tin miner's cornish pasty with mashed potatoes and gravy with a side of mixed vegetables. The price tag was $14 and some change. The pasty was decent, not particularly good or bad. Same for the mashed potatoes. The mixed vegetables were awful, they were frozen and not steamed well. Warm on the outside cold on the inside. Even without the mixed vegetables I feel like I overpaid for this by at least $7. If I ever go back I'd definitely try something else."}
{"text":"Great bar - I never made it to the first location of Big Ben's and always wanted to stop in...I'm loving the new place though.  The food is great for bar fare and the service was spot on.  I will always remember Big Ben's as my first and only experience with the \"Spotted Dick\" umm not  a fan of this dessert but it was worth a try.  Great place to meet some friends after work, and a decent outside patio once Spring finally arrives :)"}
{"text":"Best fish and chips to be found on this side of the pond for sure! Excellent bangers and mash also."}
{"text":"Ok, ok. so a British pub along the light rail is bound to be hyped up.  But I'm quite sold on the atmosphere of this place, inside and out.  Though the food and beverage prices are a bit steep, its nice to have a chill hangout with a good patio.  I went on a Friday night and expected mild-to-moderate revelry, but instead I observed a reserved post-college crowd, soccer on the telly, and a reggae singer.  Sounds like a pleasant evening.  I agree with other Yelpers that the new pub doesn't have the charm of the old house.  The interior is pretty cramped and lacks seperate rooms that gave the old restaurant a parlor-like effect.  Instead, the bar and the compact dining area is seperate by a curtained half wall, breaking up this already cramped space.  So, I headed towards the patio and it was golden-the light rail speeds by you and see the neigbors in the condos acoss the street yelling at one another from the balconies.  Perfect place to see urban life.  The staff is very friendly and though understaffed, a server came out to ask my friend and I if we needed anything.  I find that patio-dwellers get ignored at most joints so this was a nice touch.    While the new Big Ben doesn't make a splash on my list of Charlotte hang-outs, I will atleast give it an honorable mention. It does however make for a nice diversion from my tried and true weekend hangouts or a good spot for  launching an evening in Southend.  I look forward to grabbing dinner at Big Ben the next time I see a show at Tremont or Amos'."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner Friday Night at Big Ben.  Quick, courteous service. I had chicken diane, rice and veggies,  excellent!  My friends enjoyed fish and chips and chicken pot pie.  Food was awesome,  great drinks and entertainment was such a plus.  Always enjoy our time at the Pub!"}
{"text":"Good standard English pub with a nice selection of beers and full bar. We enjoyed the bangers and mash and fish n chips! The fish n chips were my favorite and the fish was perfectly crisp without being greasy. I'm excited to come back and try the traditional English breakfast!"}
{"text":"Love Love this place! Their British dishes are spot on and so authentic! I highly recommend the full English breakfast; fish n' chips, bloody Mary's, and Cornish pasty! Honestly whatever you pick, you are going to love. If there is a soccer game on, it's playing on the big screen. Service can be slow do to the number of waitresses they use, but grab a beer and just enjoy yourself! Great outdoor patio also."}
{"text":"So, I'm in the foodservice business and one time I had to do some nutrition analysis on Welse Rarebit.  Now, knowing what I did about British cuisine I figured it was some sort of offal.  Then I discovered it's really just cheese sauce on toast.  Wow.  Sounds good.  Then I discovered Big Ben and they serve Welsh Rarebit (as well as bubbles and squeak which I remember from Wind in the Willows or something).  They also make a mean Shepherd's pie.  I'm sure the fish and chips is good and it's probably their signature dish, but when I go there I always get a Shepherd's Pie, Beef and Mushroom pie, or some other awesomeness.  Big Ben's is my favorite British pub in Charlotte and if I'm not feeling British I can hop across the street to Tyber Creek and get my Irish on."}
{"text":"I got the fish and chips.  Fish really did not have much flavor and was kind of bland but was crispy.  Seems like a pretty cool sports (soccer) bar at night but for lunch not my favorite.  I would go if someone asked me to.  Atmosphere is pretty cool.  I was really hoping for more.  I may give it another try and order something different.  We went in a group of 4 and there were mixed reviews between the four us."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times. Yes the Fish and chips is amazing. But my favorite is the Black and Blue salad. Blackened steak cooked to perfection and mixed in a balsamic vinegar dressing with blue cheese crumbles , pine nuts and whatever else. Yummy !"}
{"text":"My favorite little bar in charlotte. With the BEST bartender in town! This place has great beer and great atmosphere. They have music on weekends and good food. If you want traditional British food then stop by. Definitely love coming at night because it's never to busy."}
{"text":"We ate here pk a Sunday at 12 noon and were seated immediately. The service from then on was a bit slow but the food was amazing! I had the English Breakfast and every bite was delicious. Definitely coming back here. Great place for brunch!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite place to order in Charlotte. The service is always excellent and if there's any problems the managers are quick to solve and help."}
{"text":"I can't believe this was my first time coming here but it was. Came on a Saturday night before the live band started (which we did on purpose). When they seated us it was a little weird that they had us crawl through every person on the right side of the restaurant to seat us in the one table empty in the very middle up under the television. That I was not a fan of!! There were plenty of seats on the other side but we dealt with it.   However the important stuff... on to the food!! We ordered the bubble and squeak, which I surprisingly really liked (think potato cake with cabbage), and a scotch egg (it was okay to me and my friend from London says it's not the best he's had), appetizers for the three of us.  I got the Chicken pot pie as my entree and it was delicious.  My boyfriend got the Tin Miners Cornish pasty, which he liked better than mine and I also liked it (but not better than mind lol). His brother got the Lord's roast lamb which he said was good. We did not try dessert although next time that bread pudding is happening as I hear it's amazing!!  Overall the food was good but not blown away by it. I want to give it 3.5 stars but that's not an option and I really do just think 4 is a tad too much. I'm hoping on my next visit I can up the rating a bit :)"}
{"text":"this was my first time at big ben's and i think they recently moved to the atherton mill area. i don't know where they were before, but they have a private lot, so that's nice.  we had cheese stick app's and split fish and chips entree. the cheese sticks were good, but we had to ask twice for a different dipping sauce. the fish was great! crispy and large portions! they brought it out on separate plates for us too, which was nice! some places aren't as accommodating to plate splitters. it comes with steak fries, which i also liked. so over all, i'd have given it a 4 on food. ....  where the 3 comes in is the atmosphere. it's LOUD in there. really high ceilings which just carries the sound around. there was also a band, which didn't help. the food runner who brought our app out took it to the wrong table at first. when my boyfriend asked for a whisky and soda, the server asked if he wanted regular or diet. we assume he was new, so not the worst thing in the world, but...   so, a solid 3 it is."}
{"text":"As usual, the lying cow on my GPS insisted I was at my destination and I was not.  Thanks to perseverance and a female's uncanny ability to read maps (ha!), I was able to find this great little spot.  (thank you Yelp photos!)  Dark wood, low lighting, lots of British items (including Union Jack ties on the wait staff) - this was right up my alley.  And speaking of alley, that is where you enter - not under the signage.  My waitress was friendly and helpful, though I am low maintenance, so I am pretty easy to please as long as you remember I am sitting there.  At an early 6:00 on a Wednesday night before a holiday (July 4th), the crowd was sparse for dining, though the bar seemed to have a pretty lively bunch.  They had some $4 pint specials (I believe it was Guiness, though I don't drink so I wasn't paying attention).  Also, Wednesday has half price appetizers.    The food: Cottage pie ($12):  Ground beef, peas, carrots and onions in a beefy gravy, covered with mashed potatoes and topped with melted cheese.  Very well flavored and not overly salty.  It is hard to do a cottage pie to my liking and this was delicious.  Though unevenly heated, some spots were molten hot and others were room temp, it was a very good dish that I would definitely order again.   Bubble and squeak ($4) - A pan seared mashed potato cake with cabbage in it.  I like colcannon from the Irish, so I was hoping this was kind of like that.  Alas, it was a mashed potato cake with a little cabbage in it.  It was kind of salty to me.  But, different.  I liked it, but I didn't love it.  I did however eat every bit like I wasn't going to get food ever again because I like white food groups with a pan sear on them.    On the far right side of Atherton Mill, there was plenty of parking, even directly in front of the pub.  If you are heading towards uptown and exit the parking lot on the same side that Big Ben's is on, you can catch a stop light to get back onto South Blvd rather than trying to cross all of the traffic.  Wonderful little spot, I shall return!  (the food is better than the pictures I have posted would have you believe - I try to not use my flash inside of restaurants, as to not disturb other people with the weird fat girl taking pictures of her food, and this is a dark bar, so the pictures were bleh)."}
{"text":"I think this is the only British themed restaurant in town??  I stopped in the other night to have dinner with a friend. Obviously, if you aren't a fan of British anything, don't go here. I ordered the sausage plate, they weren't too heavy in flavor but I enjoyed them very much. Paired well with the side of mashed potatoes and Guiness. :)  Next time I'm trying the Shepard's Pie for sure! Cherio."}
{"text":"This is one of my favs. I'm slightly biased because I have British family. It's a good quiet pub and a good rowdy pub if you go during a game. Either way the haddock fried fish and chips are great along with the pies or dishes!"}
{"text":"Ive been meaning to try this place sine we moved to Charlotte and after a horrendous (which I dont want to get into) adventure we finally ended up here for brunch. Both the hubby and I ordered the English breakfast. It was excellent! The eggs were yum and I especially love their sausage and bacon. The meat is definitely good quality. I also liked the grilled mushrooms...although a bit on the blander side (lack of salt and pepper) the brown sauce make it all better. Hubby and I left fully satisfied and I am planning on going back for the fish and chips :o)"}
{"text":"One of my favorite parts of coming here is that i get to sing \"Bangers, Beans and Mash\" from Get Him To The Greek all day long with no shame whatsoever. Its all on the menu hahaha. Ok, so ended up here on Thanksgiving after driving around forever trying to find some place open to eat. Kudos to Big Ben for being open and not just having a prix fixe turkey menu that day. Everything was available.  It's a cozy little place with an inviting staff.  Decent beer specials and the food is pretty good. The fish and chips are solid and you get a ton of food. They offer a decent breakfast too. I had the traditional English breakfast and i left stuffed. Its convenient to the light rail as well so it's easy to stop in for a few drinks or food on the way downtown."}
{"text":"I'll start off this review with a \"Please come back to Myers Park!!!\"  This staple moved to South End after their quaint cottage on Providence Rd. burned down several years ago and unfortunately it just hasn't been the same since they moved to Atherton Mill.   The food is good, this time around it was fish and chips. Huge portion of perfectly fried haddock with a big 'ol pile of steak fries. The food was topped off with a mini British flag and a side of slaw. It went great with a pint of Boddington which was $4.50 on special.   The service was also very friendly and there was a oddly funny musical duo performing reworked hits on keyboard and a guitar. Think back to that SNL skit with Will Ferrell and Ana Gastyer. Unfortunately the place was nearly dead, which doesn't seem good for a Friday night.   The place is unlike anything else in town. But unfortunately the space just doesn't seem to fit the concept like it did in its old spot.   I remember fun trivia nights on the old patio and celebrating British New Year (at 7 PM rather than midnight) in the cozy side room. Now that space is a Sprint store. I think Big Ben's could really hit it big again with a change of scenery."}
{"text":"As a bar, it's great but the food and atmosphere needed help.  After the Yelp Get Lucky event tonight, my wife and I stopped at Big Ben's for a light meal.  We ended up being seated away from the musicians which consisted of an electric guitar and a bass but even at this distance, it was extremely loud, especially couple with a roudy group in the bar which was a few feet away.Sometimes musicians are under the impression that if loud is good, louder is better. Not necessarily the case and it was definately true this evening.  We could not hear our server so we had to point out our order. I had the haddock sandwich with steak fries and sweet tea.  My wife had a black and blue steak salad.  She loved her's but mine was lacking. The haddock had a mealy texture to it with little taste. The Steak Fries were under cooked and raw in the middle.  Maybe an off night because I've dined here several times over the years and had generally enjoyed it. Not the case tonight. Maybe next time I hope because in generally I enjoy the menu and it's one of the few places where you can go and consistently watch soccer. Service has always been good here."}
{"text":"Great fish and chips!  Four of us had dinner here, all food was good.  They started playing music bingo while we where there, which turned out to be kinda fun."}
{"text":"As 55 promised... GREAT Burger! !! !!!  Last night (Tuesdays are \"Trivia Night\") we ate Burgers and Chips (chips as we know in US) [they have fries too], watched the Olympics (many screens) and \"played\" Trivia (I'm no fan and still did alright) It was a lot of fun!  This was our first visit to the \"new\" location, 55 a BIG Fan of the Myers Park (pre-fire) location (I only visited it one time the did have a cool \"cellar\"!  I ate \"Bangers and Mash\" at the other location... Last Night the Burger was GREAT!  Burger of ground Beef gets five yelp stars even though it was not exactly as I ordered it... I said no Cheese, it had cheese, I said Onion, it had no Onion, I said Ketchup it had no Ketchup, three \"strikes\"?  NO!  All of this is easy to fix without sending it back!!!  Our server offered to take it back and get it right, I told her NO, \"I'll fix it!\" and I did! They did get the no Mayo right!!!  It was Great!  I added Ketchup and she brought me a plate of Red Onion, mmmmm, nothing left but plate!!!  These Chips are American style \"chips\" Potatoes thinly (perfectly) sliced, deep fried, (probably the same day then reheated?)  These were the CRUNCHY Crisp style Chips, so if that is what you like you'll probably LOVE these!  Here is what I LOVE and what I should have asked for: : Made to order (right then NOT reheated) more lightly fried and slightly tender!  My yelp rating of these Chips:   Potato Thinness 5 yelp stars  Crunchy Crispness (even though that is not my preference) 5 stars  The service was very good and did not need to be much better as far as we were concerned!  This place looks GREAT, plenty British Pub for me, please do not say it's a Sports Bar, that would ruin it for me and we were watching the Super Heavy Weight Class Weight Lighting (\"Lift Weighting\" as Paul Koehler says).    Enter through the Alley!  Cool Alley Patio, partly covered, shade from Sun, not shelter from rain though!  Cool Light Rail Patio also (opposite side)!  Multiple patios always impresses me!  Why does eating outside seem so Romantic to me, even if I'm alone, even if I'm alone with friends along (you know what I mean right???)  Live Music (wait til you see the stage) Friday and Saturday Evenings!  I'll be checking this out!"}
{"text":"Being the only English pub in town and having won for best fish and chips,  I initially tried this place out and the food was amazing even though the staff wasn't so. The atmosphere, though supposed to be British, isn't so much so. What ultimately made me give only 3 stars is that when I returned for the amazing fish and chips I had a month previously,  I soon realized they had changed their recipe and that I now was eating a much smaller, almost fish stick like fish and chips and well, the service was even worse. For the price and inconsistencies,  I doubt I will be back."}
{"text":"I'm from Texas bar hoping while I'm here. If you come here ask for Tamira! Haven't bad this much hospitality from anyone, even in Texas in a while! Great place, good beer and great staff. Thank y'all so much!"}
{"text":"I want to give 2.5 stars but that's not an option so just imagine I did.  2.5 stars, here we go....  We went for a walk last night around our neighborhood and this place caught my eye because of the sign that said \"Well Wednesday\" all well drinks $3!  Ok, in we went.  It was pretty dead so we were seated right away.  Whiskey and Coke for him and Whiskey Sour for me.  They came out quick, were decent sized but my Sour lacked a cherry which is a minor detail but I secretly really wanted one.  We decided to share the Fish and Chips cause we weren't super hungry, it was ok.  The fries were better than the fish I thought.  We got talked into dessert and chose the Bread and Butter pudding.  This is where 2 of the 2.5 stars come from.  It was AMAZING, warm with raisins some kind of heavenly sauce and whipped cream.  Yum.  One more drink was ordered and we got our bill.  They charged $2 extra for an extra plate because we shared the meal.  This makes me mad because they didn't state this beforehand.  If I didn't make it obvious we were sharing and just ate off the one plate would you have added the $2?  As my Dad would say because of that it's an OTOTO.  One time, one time only kind of place!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and have enjoyed my time both times.  Food: Big Ben has most of your standard bar-food-type offerings with a few British foods as well. I could go on, but I imagine that most are here to drink, not eat.  Service: Both times I've been, the service has been great. It did not take long to get our food and drinks, and our server was pretty good at making sure our glasses were full.  Price: The prices are in line with most bars. $10-$15 will get you most of the entrees. Beers and other alcohol prices were also in line with most bars.  I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Went specifically for the fish and chips and thought it was pretty tasty. The piece of fish was so huge I could only eat half and the chips were the standard steak fries. Scotch egg was just okay, probably wont be getting that again. Overall the food was decent and the service pretty quick."}
{"text":"The chicken pot pie is amazing.  Had the Bubble & Squeak appetizer (potato & cabbage) which came with a small salad.  It was delicious!  This place does have the best Fish & Chips in Charlotte.  The Cottage Pie is very good, too!  Big Tvs, good drink selection."}
{"text":"Attended the Guinness Cup soccer match and thought that nothing would top off the evening like a visit to an well recommended English style pub. Unfortunately, as tempting as the menu looked, we never found out how the food was.  Somehow, the management must have missed the memo that nearly 70,000 soccer fans were in town and reduced their wait  & kitchen staff to only 5 ....because is was \"slow' (during the game..duh!).    We arrived around 10PM  as the crowd was ebbing, got seated & waited for 90 minutes for any morsel of food and despite some desperate measures by the over-whelmed hostess (and single waitress) managed only get drinks (with great confusion) and 2 appetizers.   We finally left following out another VERY angry group of diners after the waitress, upon questioning admitted it might be an additional hour before the meals could be served!  What could have been a banner evening was tarnished by very poor planning on someone's part and very dysfunctional lack of service & coordination.   I think that there is great potential here IF this establishment can get past its lack of preparation for the \"big leagues\""}
{"text":"Very much your typical English pub in America, not manufactured version of a English pub a true one. Couple of old geezers talking in the corner, weird smell and English premier league team losing in Europe on TV. Dark wood English gear on the walls flags the queen and all that stuff. Be back again nice reminder of home"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. Not really authentic enough for my taste, but I did like it. Not particularly memorable, but I might go back if in the area. Try it, you might enjoy it."}
{"text":"I've only been here once and that was a lunchtime visit.  The food was very good though the wait was almost 40 minutes after ordering --seemed a bit excessive being as we arrived at 11:30am and we were the only people in there; there were only 5 of us.  The pub itself has a very old-school British pub feel --probably the most authentic I've seen since living in the states for over 12 years.  It was pretty dark, with accent lighting and had a stale ale kind of smell.  Yes, the stale ale smell 'IS' required if you want to make the 'authentic British pub' feel.  Though this might not sound too appealing, it really adds to the atmosphere and isn't as bad as it sounds :)  There was a lot on the menu I wanted to try; however, there is only so much one can cram into one's mouth during a Friday lunch session --at least without having to taking a nap when returning to work.  I will be visiting here again and look forward to sampling more of their traditional style foods.  I will certainly update this review after another visit."}
{"text":"This place is so neat!!!  We stopped in on a Saturday for a couple of beers & the bartender was so sweet, thorough and knowledgable.  The decor makes you feel as if you are out of town and they have giant tvs.  Prices were a bit high but the menu looked interesting.  We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Neat atmosphere. Service was poor - I had to get my own menu after waiting at the bar for a while, waited longer to have my drink order placed, ran out of beer without being asked if I would like another drink, & had more waiting getting my check and being able to pay my tab. Kind of a bummer."}
{"text":"Good traditional English pub, the people were very friendly and the service was great.  I recommend getting the Tomato Imperial appetizer special, it was very fresh and tasty.  The cottage pie was also very good."}
{"text":"I am so fantastically jealous of the meat eaters when I see the cottage pie. I wish they'd make a veggie version.   Sigh.  The food is authentically English, and the environment can make you forget where you are for the evening. I don't even mind that my only real dinner option is the cheese appetizer...it's a fun cheese plate with lots of relish. There's also the veggie salad that's pretty good.  While I often leave hungry, I still like this pub. The bar is stocked with all kinds of goodies, and the patio is as good as any in the area."}
{"text":"\"Ok..... bare-able.... but not good\"  Been here many times... Keep trying to believe Big Bens will come thru.... Oh well  Food is still par... Absolutely nothing to write home about.  And the bar...How frustrating ..... Still charging way too much.  We truly tried, tried and tried again....   Good bye, Big Bens."}
{"text":"Unreal Scotch Eggs!!!  Probably the best I have ever had.  Served with a fruity marmalade instead of mustard - sweet mixed with the salty sausage/egg combo.  Sooo perfect!    There is a huge variety of beer - Pilsner Urquell my fav on TAP!!  But no really great beer specials or happy hour specials on beer.   So it isnt the cheapest place to drink but the food and the cozy atmosphere make up for it.  I have also had the salads here and they are outstanding and reasonably priced.   I would have given this place five stars but I have to mention the few times I have been in here the music choice is horrible.  On these occasions it was some sort of gangster music which one of the waitresses must have picked out cause she pranced around the entire restaurant singing it.  I am all for other's joy and singing while you work I guess but I think this was a bit excessive and she should take her talents to a karaoke bar instead of holding us patrons hostage to her pipes.  But I can't imagine this happens all the time so I definitely will keep going to this place and LOVIN it!  :-D"}
{"text":"I had the \"fish 'n chips,\" (haddock) which was about $13. Were they the best fish 'n chips that I've ever eaten? Ummm, no - not even close. They were average. And for $13, one would think that there would be two pieces of fish, perhaps? 3/5.  The waitress supplied malt vinegar and ketchup without being asked, so I was impressed by that. I love malt vinegar on my fish 'n chips. If you've never tried this - you should.  The fish 'n chips were good, but not as good as I was expecting after reading all the \"OMG, these are the best fish and chips on the planet\" reviews and anticipating my visit for three years - admittedly, my expectations were sky high.    The fries were average, but I did like the fact that they were the thicker version. 3/5.  The coleslaw had no mayonnaise, so I found it to be below average. 2/5.  The tartar sauce that came with the meal was outstanding - it tasted homemade. There were capers in the tartar sauce, which is something that I do at home when I make tartar sauce. (FWIW, I also add lemon pepper, dill weed, and a smidgen of cayenne to my version.) 5/5.  I was going to order a Guinness, but I said the heck with it, and just ordered my usual, sweet tea with lemon. Their sweet tea wasn't sweet enough, but I remedied that with Equal. 4/5.  None of the above stopped me from eating everything and cleaning my plate. ;o)  Service? Outstanding. Friendly. Cordial. Professional. Timely.  My server was a lady in her 40's, and she was simply excellent. She would not been out of her depths in a Michelin three star restaurant. 5/5.  Décor? Faux UK.  There WAS a soccer game on the telly, but I couldn't see it from my table.   The music? Sinatra, which I think of as New York or Vegas, not Manchester or Bristol. It was incongruent, but strangely enough, I liked hearing ole' blue eyes croon. (I didn't know that he did a cover of \"Bad, Bad Leroy Brown!) ;o)  Parking? Adequate. 3/5.  The place was easy to find since it's located right off South Blvd. 4/5.  The Charlotte light rail system almost runs through the bar, so if I lived in Charlotte, I would be a regular here. (Tremont station)  Don't get the wrong impression, I'm not saying that this is a bad place - we've just been introduced. I would guess that this is a GREAT place to grab a Guinness with friends.   I was surprised that there weren't many people here for lunch on a Friday. I counted nine diners, including myself.   I would like to return and try some more authentic British food, such as their version of shepherd's pie, sausage sarnie, and bubble and squeak. This is the type of place that has been know to \"grow\" on me, so I was not disappointed with my first visit."}
{"text":"Good Food, but not excellent.  A bit pricy.  The location of Big Ben Pub is convenient.  Right in South End.  That is it's best attribute.  We went on a Friday night, and this place was empty.  They had live music, which was good, but a little loud for a dinner crowd (8pm).  I ordered the Fish n' Chips.  I really enjoyed the fish, the fries (chips) were pretty good as well.  I couldn't help but think that I could have gotten the same thing at a seafood restaurant for significantly less money.  My wife got the Haddock sandwich.  We had the same feeling about the sandwich as we had with the Fish n' Chips:  It was good, but on the pricey side for what it was.  The thing that locked this review into a Three star, rather than a possible Four star, review, was the fact that they added the tip into our bill.  What!!!!  We had 6 people at our table, three couple's.  I don't know why it bothered me so much, but it did.  So they get Three Stars."}
{"text":"We had about 4 different appetizers to share and I hate to say it but the chips were the best. The other items we had were just bland."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Big Ben's bar and only recently tried their food.   I think this place has great character and it would be a top pick if you have friends in town. They usually have live music on the weekend and some draft specials. They also have a decent sized patio where you can watch the light rail zip by...well, not really zip, but you know.   Last visit was for Fish and Chips. Wow. What a huge portion, I couldn't even finish it! The fish was fresh and the batter was delicious! Very happy I tried it!   The service was great, and as always, I enjoyed the atmosphere. I loved the old Big Ben, but I love the new one too!"}
{"text":"We only ordered beer and sat on the patio, but the inside looked really cool and would be a good place to watch soccer games. They didn't have a huge beer selection, but the patio was very nice. The table next to us ordered fish and chips, which looked and smelled great. It's right off the blue line, so very easy to get to."}
{"text":"Two words and a letter- FISH N CHIPS! It was outstanding. Light, tender, flaky, yummy. Everything real fish and chips should be. As an appetizer we tried the sausage rolls. Also not to be missed. Then the home run was dessert. Bread and Butter Pudding! Just scrumptious.   Lots of places try to be other places. Big Ben does as well but gets it right. My buddy who was eating with me is from England and he flat out says Big Ben's is as close to a British pub as you'll find in the states.  We notice they also advertise a proper English breakfast. I've already decided that's a must try. The service was top-notch as well. Very attentive without being annoying. What are you waiting for? GO!  Big Ben's Pub: A+"}
{"text":"Big Ben.   I saw your ROTD and thought, \"Hey, we'll meet John H there for a beer before dinner\".  Bartender was friendly - draft beer selection was good. The prices however - ugh! Three beers for around $20. When did a pint of Birdsong become $6.50?   I dig the British pub vibe. Yeah, baby! (obligatory Austin Powers remark)There's a small stage, small dining room and what almost feels like a much larger outdoor space. Lots of TVs with sports.  Great Southend location. John assures me this is a cool place to come for New Years and has a full English Breakfast on weekends.  There is this really cool pitcher behind the bar that looks like \"The Donald\"."}
{"text":"We all need a good British pub in our lives. The bar tenders are down to earth. No frills just drinks and ok food. Great to watch games and after work HH."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times for dinner and a beer or two and was never disappointed.  We noticed the breakfast items and ran back here last Sunday morning.  The place was deserted at 9:30am... right when everywhere else was jamming up.  Coffee.... full English breakfast... yum!  The management hires the best, most friendly servers!  Good on you guys!  Love what you are doing.  EDIT -  This has become a regular place for my wife and I.  Food is always solid, hot and tasty.  The beer selection rotates... several ciders on tap as well."}
{"text":"Awesome little pub right here in Charlotte but when you walk in you'll feel like you've arrived across the big pond.  The girlfriend and I popped in for a quick drink while out shopping just because we had been meaning to.  So we sat down to the nice sized bar and had a few beers.  Super friendly service and a great selection of spirits and not to mention a menu that looked very, very appealing.  I'll be back to give it whirl for sure!"}
{"text":"The wait is finally over. After saying \"I wanna go in there\" for 5 years, we finally visited Big Ben's pub. I've heard and read about the fish and chips, so that's what I had. Don't ever recall having haddock, so it was going to be a new experience. I tried not comparing my plate to the plate I had in Ireland last year. I thought that would be unfair. The first thing my wife said, \"that doesn't look as good as the one in Ireland\".    The taste was ok. Kind of bland in an English way. No soul or personality to it. My fish in Ireland tasted like there was a story to it. Like the oil it was fried in, was the same since the turn of last century. I was stunned by how good that was. That's why I didn't want to compare. But it was hard not to.    My wife had a curry dish that was quite lovely. Very tasty.    The service was bland, so I guess that was the theme. Very nice waitress, but she left us alone, and not in a good way.     All in all, I believe this was another first and last for us."}
{"text":"Mmmm, fish & chips.   First time at the new location. I know, what's my deal? I'm a horrible procrastinator.   Ok, let's get the critiques out of the way first. I saw one server wearing a Union Jack tie, and thought \"Oh, how quirky, it must be ironic.\" Then I saw 3 more and realized, \"Oh, you poor things, that's your uniform.\" Look, I get it, it's a British pub but really? You can't make me believe that British bartenders all wear flag ties. The decor was also a little too kitschy for me- while I could believe that pubs in the UK may have their flag on display, I hardly think it's one with Prince William's wedding picture on it.  Come on.  Ok, all that aside, I still had a good experience. I went with the haddock sandwich, which while I enjoyed it, was quite messy and fell apart in my hands. It wasn't really poorly made, there was just so much fish it was hard to stay in one piece. I'll definitely stick with regular fish & chips next time. Chips (fries, whatever) were nice and hot, with both malt vinegar and ketchup offered. (I won't lie, I used both. Sorry.)  Bar service was excellent, bartender recommended Warsteiner Oktoberfest over the more popular Sam Adams, and it was an excellent choice. There were a few more foreign beers on there I'm eager to try.   Haven't been here yet? What's your deal?"}
{"text":"Best British pub in Charlotte!  I was in town from California over Christmas and went to Big Ben's twice that week.  Everyone at our table was 100% satisfied with whatever they ordered.  I got the fish and chips and they were fantastic.  Two giant pieces of fish, each the size of a small whale and lots of thick cut chips.  Yum yum!  My Dad ordered the steak and mushroom pie and he was raving about it, which really says something because my family is British and my Dad is a total food snob (love you, Dad!)    I am totally devastated to learn that this place burned down :( The staff were very friendly and the building oozed charm.  I'll miss you Big Ben's -- I hope you return soon!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, awesome atmosphere, beer is awesome, bartenders name is Randell and he is cool as hell.  Will definitely come back to this place!!!"}
{"text":"Aside from it always being short-staffed, the food is always delicious & comforting. Great portions! They're most know for their fish 'n chips & their burgers but the shepards pie, made with ground lamb, is scrumptuous! If you want a hearty meal, I highly recommend the Tin Miners Cornish Pastry. Just wish they'd resolve the on-going staffing issue."}
{"text":"Checked out the new location of Big Ben's in Southend on a Friday night, and they had a live reggae singer jamming - nice! The space in intimate, very British in decor, and with the high ceilings, an enjoyable place to meet friends.  $4 Boddingtons were the special, and they really poured it nicely (think Guiness at Tyber Creek nice!). Prices were high for shots (4 royal flushes = $36 without tip), but then again this isn't the place you'd normally do shots anyway. Bar tender was nice, but absent and it took a while to get our checks and have her give change. I'd go back, but this won't be my local bar anytime soon."}
{"text":"It's a nice place with tasty food. I like the fish 'n' chips as well as the shepherds and cottage pies.Will return."}
{"text":"So, the light rail provides a nice way to visit the Southend without worrying about have too much fun and getting behind the wheel.  So a little walk from the place and a quick ride to the stop just a short walk to the pub makes this a nice little get away from the center city.  For this particular evening it was Tuesday night pub quiz and we sat outside to get away from it.  Unfortunately, they blasted it on the speakers outside so that was a real disappointment.  It was great to see the place packed on a Tuesday night, but not everyone was there to hear the guy tell cheese jokes as he moved through the trivia questions.  We has an appetizer and a few beers (which were discounted this evening) so all and all a nice night and a nice price at a nice place."}
{"text":"Great fish and chips the best I have had in years. The fish was very  clean and not greasy. Scotch eggs were fabulous.  Use mustard on the  eggs."}
{"text":"I've eaten here three times now, twice for lunch and once for dinner.  My biggest compliment is that I've always gotten quick and friendly service.  Oh, and their bread and butter pudding is OUT OF THIS WORLD!  However, the food I've had was just ok otherwise, and their beer specials and food are just ok.  Still, I like the ambiance here, and I will definitely come back again and again for dessert."}
{"text":"Have been going weekly for Tuesday night pub quiz. Not the easiest service situation, for sure. 30 - 50 people all showing up and ordering within 15 to 20 minutes of each other.   Even with that handicap, we haven't had to wait unduly for drinks or food. The servers are competent and friendly, especially Lucky.   I have yet to get a dish that wasn't very good. The fish and chips and black and blue salad are my two favorites.   My only nibbling qualms include the tight space (might just be on quiz night) and no change in the nightly special- Tuesday has been fish and chips (delightful) and $4 pints of Sierra Nevada (meh)."}
{"text":"Love this place great food the steak and kidney pie is amazing. Nice selection of beer great atmosphere and service."}
{"text":"After 2 hours of deliberating where to eat for lunch, we finally settle on Big Ben. It's a British style pub with some TVs to watch sports. The server was great and checked back on us frequently. She made the suggestion of ordering the fish and chips which many on Yelp have already reviewed. I haven't ever tried fish and chips so I don't have much to compare it to but it was good when you put a lot of tartar sauce on it. Tip: ask for extra tartar sauce. FYI a Wally is a pickle."}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of spending NYE here at Big Ben's.  Not too crowded, had to reserve a table, but the service was fantastic... the live band and bagpiper was a nice touch and great way to bring in 2013!  I was a little late to the party, but I was able to park pretty easily - the Atherton Mill shopping center had plenty of parking.  As soon as I walked in, it was welcomed with an immediate cozy feeling.  People were having a good time enjoying each other and the atmosphere.  We ordered food and our server was very attentive - glad to see that everyone was able to celebrate 2013, including the staff after all the champagne was passed out.  Will have to check out Big Ben without the NYE craziness, but I have a feeling it would be a nice regular place to eat, hangout, and drink."}
{"text":"I can't say that I've ever been to their original location before it burned down but I heard it was awesome with a great atmosphere.  The new building is kind of unique and sits right on the light rail/trolley line.  It must be fun to sit outside and watch the trains/trolley go by.  Anyway, I've been here a few times for lunch and it never disappoints.  The Haddock and chips is supurb and best with malt vinegar which is supplied.    The service here is outstanding as well.  I've had the same server multiple times and she's friendly, courteous and ready to explain when is best on the menu.  The atmosphere of the restaurants has memorabilia from the UK but I did find it odd that the last visit the music playing was Billy Joel.  Shouldn't it have been Elton John?  ;)  Another great thing about Big Ben's.  They support the LGBT community...note the equality stickers on every door!"}
{"text":"Yummy food and a cool atmosphere! Limited seating but an authentic London-style pub feel for sure. I bet it's a great spot to be when the World Cup is on or for any sporting event for that matter! I got a bangers sandwich and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Super friendly waitress (Tina?).  We were the first customers on a Sunday morning at 9am.  LOL.  She had a great, droll sense of humor and had us smiling the whole time we were there.  We were pleasantly surprised by the brightness even though it's a Pub feel, with the bar being separated nicely from the main dining area.  Everything was very clean and  tidy.  Interesting art work/decorations with plenty of British/irish flair.  They have gobs of good ol' English/Irish fare.  We went with the simple Eggs over Buttered Toast & I got mine poached for some good, oozy yolks over my toast.  The potatoes were nicely small & done well, with some crispy ones, too (my favess)!  We definitely would go back & are glad we found an amazing Sunday breakfast place."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch, it wasn't busy. Obviously, I ordered the fish n chips. It was crispy and delicious. Parking was tough, beware. Food was good so check it out if you can find a parking spot."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a friendly staff and mellow vibe. The $4.50 20 oz daily specials are great as well!  The food here has, for the most part been good (I am not counting against them that time I had steak and kidney pie expecting steak and kidney beans, and what a surprise I got when the pie came with kidney in it!) however the first time I went the chicken pie I ordered was made with some sort of spoilt milk product. Last time I went they got my boyfriends order wrong and I finished my meal before they brought his out. It was supposed to be a steak and mushroom pie and there was no steak in it. Both times they comped the pies, but since I've only eaten here four times that's getting orders right half the time.  I would recommend this place if you are looking for something slightly different, or a good filling meal. The Cornish Pasty is a new favorite of mine."}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum. Great food, good beer, groovy environment. I wish I lived closer though."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to give this place a try, but was sadly so disappointed! Service was good and I liked the location itself, but the food was so bland. I shared the potato skins with bacon with a friend and ordered the haddock and fries for myself. The potato skins were fried well, but lacked any sort of flavor (even the bacon was bland!). The fish and chips however were the real disappointment. Again, the fry was great but the whole dish desperately needed salt. Both the fish and the fries were totally flavorless. The only thing I enjoyed on the plate was the tartar sauce."}
{"text":"We have tried fish & chips at MANY local restaurants, but none can compare to Big Ben's!  The fish is fresh, the batter is perfectly crisp, and the French fries are awesome!  Servings are huge! (Reheats perfectly in the oven!)  Service is always friendly and attentive. They always has a great selection of beer and mixed drinks.   If there's a soccer game on, the place will be packed...especially on a weekend. There's also an outdoor patio that is perfectly on a lovely sunny day!  We're huge fans of Big Ben's!"}
{"text":"live across the street, go here all the time, like the folks working there, like the beer, so far i love the food BUT its just a bit over priced.  ive had the fish'n'chips they were truly unreal, and several other items off the menu that were very good.  i dont want to bore with detail as i go there a few times a week btu I highly recommend this spot and will continue to frequent it...as i live a block away from it"}
{"text":"I've gone to this place for years but like a recent review that I've read here, it's been hit and miss. Food has been solid but service has been declining. Asking for things only to ask again a second time, quick/cold interaction with our waitress..the only time she actually smiled was when we asked for the check."}
{"text":"We were trying to decide where to eat in SouthEnd and my buddy picked Big Ben.  I was a little skeptical at first but boy was I wrong.  Their food is fantastic.  We went on a Friday and there was a live singer who was the best I've heard in the neighborhood.  I had the Tin Miners Cornish Pasty ($14).... ground beef, potatoes, onions & carrots in a puff pastry shell served with mashed potatoes, gravy with mixed veggies. It was homey and fantastic.  Had a couple Guinness with it...   We will be back!  It was great!"}
{"text":"The new Big Ben doesn't quite have the appeal of the old location, but it's still well worth a visit. The interior especially gives off a great vibe - enhanced by the friendly service - and it is one of those places that is completely different from what you would expect when walking up to a relatively nondescript building on the outside.  While the menu contains all manner of meaty fried things, it's probably better not to ask precisely what is in some of them, and just dig in and enjoy along with a fresh pint (or so), which helps to not worry quite so much about what you are eating.  Charlotte does not have a bunch of options when you get outside of certain food groups, so having Big Ben come back on the scene is definitely a good thing."}
{"text":"This place has the best fish and chips I have ever had. Bring your family bring your friends.  Every dish at my table looked amazing! I will be returning for more. They have plenty of beer on tap.  Best British pub in the US. Great service and food was hot.  Try this pub or you will regret it.  The server was very knowledgeable about all of the dishes and desserts."}
{"text":"This is my third time visiting Big Ben but my first review.  Great location, they are celebrating their 10 year anniversary so longevity is a good thing!  Excellent beer selection, many varieties for many tastes.  Menu is loaded with traditional English dishes...Bangers & Mash are amazing!!  Not a big venue but nice atmosphere and the staff are friendly & helpful even at non-peak times.  Outdoor seating is available so you can enjoy the day with a good beer!  I definitely recommend coming with a group of friends (leave the kiddos home) and relax with a pint (true 20 oz pour) or two!!"}
{"text":"A solid 3.5 stars for this cute little place.  I work right across the street and have been meaning to go here for the food, besides just belly up to the bar.  Its a really nice set up and the atmosphere feels very cozy.  For lunch, they had great lunch specials (for $5.50) and it included 5 choices!  Their menu is so huge and very diverse.  Including your traditional English pub fare of fish and chips, bangers and mash, and shepherds pie.  I had the beef stroganoff over rice and it was pretty good.  Nothing tremendously special, and I was left wishing I had gone for the fish and chips instead.  I have heard great things about that.    I will be back here to try something else and the prices and atmosphere are really nice.  The service was great and it was fairly busy for a mid day late lunch.  Which is always a great sign."}
{"text":"Cool spot to grab a beer or drink, they have drink specials every day. The ambience is what I would be imagine a British pub to be. The server was super friendly and ecstatic. Very affordable!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to visit a British pub in Charlotte for a while now, so I was very pleased to come across Big Ben.  The pub is located right in the hustle and bustle of South End - right along the light rail tracks.  The atmosphere inside is very homey and inviting.  As I typically do at British pubs, I ordered the signature fish and chips.  This consisted of one giant piece of haddock with fries and a side of cole slaw.  Delicious! The fish was not too heavy, but still filling.  Washed it down with a cold beer.  Their beer selection was pretty impressive.  Even got to sample one.  What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Not usually over this way. Needed a quick lunch and something different. Really great place to find. Loved my haddock and chips!"}
{"text":"If you read my previous reviews of this restaurant, I think you'll see that I've tried to be fair, even-handed. But today's experience was ridiculously frustrating. We sat down, ordered two Guinness pints to start. Then...the server returned and announced, \"We're out of Guinness.\" I understand that this is a British -- not Irish -- pub, but to not keep Guinness on hand even in a British pub in America is appalling.  And since the server didn't know up front that they had no Guinness, I have to conclude that they don't consider this an important issue. The end of the story? We left and went to Sir Ed's, where the service is excellent and the Guinness always flows."}
{"text":"Came here with a coworker about a week ago, not too bad for bar food - kinda tight quarters but I think because it is a British Pub that's the feel they are going for.  Food wasn't great, but again it could have been because it was more of a British Bar feel."}
{"text":"Hit or Miss!! Best way to explain it. Last visit, BIG MISS!! I've been going to Big Ben for several years now. Not a \"regular\" customer but have been there many times. My last visit ruined it for me and I'm not sure I ever intend to return! To that point in a moment.  I used to love to go there because of the pub atmosphere, the food and plus they showed good sports programs. I LOVED there fish sandwich and/or Fish and Chips!! Went there about 3 years ago to get a delicious fish sandwich and it came out with the usual nice set up only to find there were 2 little \"fishstick looking things\" for the fish like something you'd get in the freezer section of Food Lion. Terrible!  Didn't go back for a little while then several months ago I stopped in to try again. That time I had another yummy, delicious dish sandwich and a charming bartender. Everything was grand! BUT, yesterday totally blew it for me. I can understand people having a bad day, I also work in the service industry BUT when you ignore your guests for some 20-30 minutes while you're doing nothing and certainly NOT BUSY that takes the cake.  I was meeting a friend that I knew would love the food, praying it would be good this time.  I arrived early so I had a seat at the bar, asked about beer/liquer specials and was informed that some local beers were $5.50 and whiskeys were $5. EXACT WORDS from Brittaney the bartender mind you. Great so I got a Hop, Drop and Roll, one of my favs and a shot of Bushmills.  Then Courtney came to take over the bar and bar table area so I tabbed out with Brittaney while talking to my friend that had shown up by that time. Tabbed out (obviously not paying close attention to the tkt ot I'd have noticed I was overcharged $1) and tipped Brittaney. Finishing my beer and waiting on Courtney to bring menus and maybe take our orders. No acknowledgement whatsoever for at least 20 minutes. Yes Courtney had just arrived at work.  Courtney evidently had to get settled. She did have to change the TV for herself or someone. She did need to carry on a non service related conversation with someone sitting at the bar.(for a while). She did have to text or get on Facebook or whatever was more important than we were although we were in plain view the entire time. I finally decided to go get my own menus and then noticed Brittaney telling Courtney something at which time she made her appearance at the table.  Took our drink orders. 2 local drafts. Went back to the phone. Finally after 5 minutes or so, another waitress asked if we needed anything and we said we had ordered beers. She volunteered to bring them (Kudos to her) and then Courtney decided to bring them.  Finally took our order. Brought our food and asked if we needed anything else. I decide since the Bushmills were $5 that sure I'd have another. She brought that and informed me it was $6 not $5???? Ok, only a buck but why was I told $5?? Then Brittaney decides she told me they were $2 off not $5 for whiskey. Ahem!! Not true! Not what she told me earlier! We all make mistakes but that got to me a little. Admit it if you screwed up alright.  Courtney apologizes for not getting to us earlier because she had just come in and had 20 different things to do. As I stated before, TV, chat chat chat chat, stand around and play on phone. And even if that were so was there NO ONE around to take orders in the meantime?? Yeah, there was! SMH! HORRIBLE SERVICE!!! On a positive note, the food was pretty good although greasy."}
{"text":"Overall:  - For the food alone, 98% of the menu is incredibly delicious and the kitchen staff seem very kind. A couple things aren't good, but the menu is great otherwise for 5 Stars there and for their kitchen staff. - For the service from bartenders and servers, 70% are great. But about 5 of 13 and their bus-boy are terrible.  - For management, as I've mentioned, they are insane and do not know how to please customers and think if they do ANYTHING for them, whether it's replacing a meal, giving a slight discount, or a free dessert, they strut like they've done the best work in their life (and they let you know it). And also, don't bother complaining about anyone, especially the 30% of the bad servers or the bus-boy who has an attitude with everything from the trash can to the lovely newlyweds that were just sat).  - The prices are high. Granted, portions are huge for a lot of things, but most items are good reheated. If you order anything that has gravy or a sauce on it, ask for it on the side so if you do take it home it won't be soggy and you can reheat it better. And reheat anything from there in the oven if possible. Pretty much 375* for 5-8 minutes does the trick for. The drinks are high too. Most drafts are $6-$7 for a pint....some are a 20 oz cup, some are 16 oz.....it's just not consistent and the most expensive draft is the Red Clay Cherry Cider that comes in maybe 12 ozs for $7!!!! That's crazy expensive.     To sum it up: Food is decent and authentic. However, the experience as a whole is pretty bad. Most of the servers are great, but there are a couple bad seeds that can ruin your dining experience from genuinely not caring about your experience. Management is INSANELY TERRIBLE. There are two managers, the owner and the chef, equally unapproachable and they will not compensate or replace anything for you. They make it seem like whatever is going on is your fault and guilt you for it. If they do happen to do something to replace a wrong/bad item, they act like they've given you the world. So, I hope you don't have to ask for a manager to help you. I really think with 2 new managers and replace the bus-boy and like 3-5 bad/rude servers, you may have a good thing going. It's also always hot there. ALWAYS hot. They always say the fans are \"broken\" and act like the air conditioner doesn't exist. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Big Ben is a neighborhood staple and a great casual spot with a European feel. The ambiance in an old mill building gives it a certain charm with the pub style. The fish and chips are delicious and they always have delicious British beers like Boddingtins and Newcastle on tap."}
{"text":"BLUF: I was full when I left, but felt like I paid too much.  I went to Big Ben one Sunday night primarily because it was within walking distance of Tremont Music Hall, where I was going to a concert later that night. I ordered a steak and kidney pie, a glass of Crispin (which happened to be on special that night, conveniently), and a slice of their sweet potato maple layered cheesecake.   The pie was all right, but I discovered I wasn't a big fan of kidney. Definitely should've gone for steak and mushroom instead. The sides that came with it were fine, but nothing special.   The cheesecake, on the other hand, was very good. However, I'm not sure it was quite worth $8 a slice.  In the end, the food was all very filling, but nothing special and not worth what I paid."}
{"text":"Big Ben is by far my favorite place to spend a weekend morning. As a huge Arsenal fan, this is the spot to watch my favorite team play. The breakfast is always fantastic, and for the later games the salads are great (steak salad is the best I've ever had). Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I went to this place the other evening because some other plans had fallen through, which I was disappointed with. I had been here before and liked it. This time, however, was exceptional.  The blond waitress that's been there forever is the absolute best. I enjoyed my food, the atmosphere and the service! Very happy!"}
{"text":"Best, and most authentic British Pub in Charlotte.  I would probably give them 5 stars, if they got rid of the corny Union Jack neckties the waitstaff wear.  Their fish and chips are the best in Charlotte - always crispy outside, moist Haddock inside, huge portion as well.  For those that wish the old location had not burned down, forcing the move to SouthEnd: yes, the pub has lost some of it's \"pub\" charm, but let's admit it: it's now a better restaurant.  Excellent cottage pie, tin miners cornish pasty, bangers and mash, and if you're feeling healthy, the black and blue salad.  Nearest place to my house that serves Spaten on tap.  If you happen to be there on a soccer weekend, make sure you don your red and white and pull for The Arsenal!  The pub is the semi-official meeting spot for The Arsenal supporters club, the Queen City Gooners."}
{"text":"I've visited here twice, once awhile ago for an impromptu birthday dinner and again last night to watch the Women's World Cup Championship. For the first visit, they were accommodating for a last minute large party.   Last night, the environment was fun for soccer, but not to rowdy, as there were mostly 40 somethings present. I had a mimosa and a Pimm's something, both which were good. The drink wasn't watered down and our waitress, Eady, was very kind and always within eyeshot. Kudos to her on such a busy night.   The table shared the crab and artichoke dip. The pita chips with it were warm and soft enough. I highly recommend the crab dip. There was also the Ploughman's platter. I didn't taste any of it, but my friends seemed to enjoy. High marks for good service!"}
{"text":"If you've ever traveled to England, or wanted to, Big Ben will give you a taste of across the pond without the plane ticket. It definitely resembles a traditional pub in England, slightly dark, very old, and a true love for all things Union Jack.   As for food, I can only attest for some appetizers, but both the Scotch eggs and bubble and squeak were spot on and delicious. If you've never had a scotch egg, I highly recommend trying it. It's a hard boiled egg rolled in breakfast sausage and fried (or sometimes baked). The bubble and squeak was of generous portion and equal parts sprouts and mashed.   Overall, I enjoyed popping in here and would certainly come back to try a traditional dinner."}
{"text":"A friend suggested Big Ben when we were in Charlotte for a day. The service was excellent and they had decent beer specials. Nice decor as well! I ordered the turkey wrap with a cup of their soup of the day, which was bacon, spinach and cheese. The soup was amazing! The turkey wrap was pretty standard, nothing special, but it was good. If I lived in the area, I could see myself hanging out here a lot!"}
{"text":"Their fish & chips were a DREAM!  The fish was very fresh and cooked to perfection.  It is very filling and you honestly do not need to order any appetizer or dessert because it's more than enough.  Definitely a great spot for date night or a small family to get together.  Great recommendation!"}
{"text":"I only came for drinks but I enjoyed it a lot! A very homie feeling when you walk in and a friendly staff. The menu is a little weird and on the pricey side but overall I liked it a lot!"}
{"text":"So seeing they had breakfast... I just had to come back the next day...  This is breakfast http://instagram.com/p/dKCyKeNkw3/  Well it is not the most healthiest but darn is it sooooo good."}
{"text":"Very authentic pub for a pint! The atmosphere is great especially for watching soccer games! The staff is extremely friendly and always attentive. A must visit for soccer games!"}
{"text":"Weirdly, they have my favorite burger in Charlotte. Haven't tried any English food, but if you want a burger from somewhere new, try them out."}
{"text":"If I could give a half mark it would be 2.5 - I give three because my server was really really nice and super helpful. As a Brit I was looking forward to some decent home cooked traditional food - I chose the steak and kidney pie. I was told it was homemade. I know what a pie out of a can both looks and tastes like and that's what I got. Not impressed at all and as a British pub, poor poor representation."}
{"text":"This bar has potential, but it is in the wrong type of building and doesn't have the right things going on.  With this place I expect a dingy hole in the wall for a place like this.  It was a little too clean, and the ceiling was too high.  I apologize for rating it based on the looks because I enjoyed the beer and the bartender, but it just didn't feel right for the kind of bar it was suppose to be in my eyes.  Also, when I went there was trivia going on and it kind of depressed me."}
{"text":"I was in Charlotte to visit the NASCAR Museum and catch a concert. Stopped at Big Ben for dinner between the two. We were greeted as soon as we came in, and our waitress was friendly and helpful. Both my daughter and I ordered the fish and chips. The portion was huge and it was very good. I would definitely stop in again if in the area."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere-- when we were eating there was a live soccer game on and people were getting into it.  Menu was a little limited, but it had something for those that were willing to try british cuisine.  We tried the fish & chips, roast lamb, and steak and mushroom pie.  The food was alright, nothing amazing, but incredibly filling."}
{"text":"My Mom came in town, after being in Germany, and wanted a specific beer, which after my searching Big Bend was the only place in Charlotte that had it on top. Needless to say the beer was good, but the food was awesome! We ordered the fish & chips and a cheeseburger with fries and shared...Both were SO good. The best fish and chips I have had in Charlotte & the burger was cooked to perfection. The only reason for the 4 stars, the service was a little slow. I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"3 words: SCOTTISH MEAT PIES!  I am so happy that it is still as good as I remember it from last summer.  Half price appetizer Wednesday made it twice as perfect. The pies were savory, and the crust was flaky even with the gravy. The meat with peas and carrots were excellent comfort food.  I wasn't as happy about the wings, they were a little over fried, but I will give it another try just to taste the curry buffalo sauce. But all is forgiven the moment I took another bite if the meat pie.   FYI, $4 pint night Tuesdays, and $10.95 all traditional British dinners (exclude the steak) on Thursdays.   I will be British (again, yes, I used to be British by national even if I don't look it) more often since it's around the corner from my work :)"}
{"text":"Visited here for the first time on April 17 with a friend.  I was a bit concerned at first because there wasn't many people inside. The server we had was the only one working the front and bar. I have to say that Nichole was phenomenal. She made some recommendations that we loved. The food was great and Nichole was absolutely incredible. This is one place I will be visiting again and as often as possible."}
{"text":"I visited for a weekday lunch, when the restaurant was pretty dead - I'm sure it's more lively in the evening, and that dishes geared toward a dinner crowd are considerably better. I had the British BLT which was ok - bread was overly toasted (nearly burnt) and it was quite dry - really needed more mayo or something. Nice beer selection - was happy to see that they had Old Speckled Hen!"}
{"text":"A great selection of British beers and British food, Big Ben is the best in Charlotte for as close to proper English food as an American palate can determine. My wife is an UK import and she gives Big Ben the thumbs up.  Ordering from the dinner menu, we started off with a Scotch Egg (a boiled egg encased in a sausage wrapper then briefly fried) which was served with English relish. After that was cleared, our dinner arrived. I had a cottage pie, which was excellent. Plenty of meat and vegetables and actual (not from packet) mashed potatoes. My wife enjoyed the lamb dinner, which was a medium size pile of sliced lamb with steamed veggies and potatoes, covered in a zingy brown gravy. (On previous visits, I found the chicken curry to be very flavorful and not too spicy.)  Desserts were the only place where Big Ben lets it down. The Sherry Trifle was labeled as \"traditional\" but it seemed to be mostly canned whipped cream with very few lady's fingers. It was way too sweet and we ended up sending it back.  For two, with one appetizer, two entrees, three beers (one domestic, two imports) and a dessert, our tab was $70. While the food and service was great, this seems a little on the high side.  On some nights, they have music in the downstairs lounge. Even with the door closed, the smoke comes up from there as well as too much of the loud music. If that bothers you, try sitting on the other side of the restaurant. There's also a full bar if you just want drinks and (warning: English ahead) crisps.  They have a small parking behind the place and you're not supposed to park on the street. Overflow parking is across the street and down the hill, next to the Bank of America. It's clearly labeled but I think it could use a bit more lighting at night.  All told, a four star place. When we want to eat English, we're here!"}
{"text":"Edie and Barb are great for service and add alot to this place. The food is phenomenal and would recommend to anyone that is near Southend...  Killer fish and chips..."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff, excellent service. I've been here many times and always enjoy myself. Pints are always on special and the atmosphere/decor is relaxing."}
{"text":"The food is amazing. Fish and chips and the roast beef (with mash potatoes) were insanely good. You MUST try the Yorkshire pudding!!!"}
{"text":"Nice spot, huge portions, friendly service, don't attempt to eat remotely healthy here!"}
{"text":"Small place with friendly service.    If you're up for bangers & mash, you will enjoy the breakfast here. I had a great breakfast special on a circular croissant. They said it was a special, but I would ask for it if I returned."}
{"text":"Very good, got there at 6pm on a Saturday night and got right in. I had a steak and mushroom pie it was very good. At $14 dollars it wasn't  a bad price. It is expensive if you compare it to the dollar menu at McDonalds, but the meal was worth the price. I have to go back and try the fish n chips they look very good."}
{"text":"This new location is quite a surprise. It as a lot of fun and the food was good. Watching soccer on the big screen with some diehard fans actually added to the experience rather than make you not want to go back again. My wife had the fish and chips and loved it. It has a great atmosphere, great people and even live music on the weekends. This is a place you need to go to at least once and then be surprised by how many times you want to go back."}
{"text":"I love this place!  I tend to forget about it until my urge for Fish n' Chips kicks into high gear.  The bar is beautiful and reminds me of being in London during college.  I always have excellent service and food!"}
{"text":"This is not the first time we have been to Big Ben Pub ...There are a lot of great things about this particular restaurant. Just to name a few, it is right next-door to savory Spice, it has a great patio, even though it backs up to the train (which is really quiet and kind a cool when it goes by), And the atmosphere is awesome...(this Total English pub is authentic, which is validated by the fact that I have actually been to London and Watford England having eaten and drank \"Real Ale\", served by a 1 armed/1 eyed bartender).  Big Ben pub is a wonderful dining experience and they have great beers on tap... Please take the time to try their chicken pot pie!"}
{"text":"Maybe I just don't like British pub food but everything I ate was extremely underwhelming. I decided to go all out and get the Cornish Pasty but it sucked. The potatoes and gravy were bland, the vegetables were flavorless, and the pasty was gross. If I ever come back here it'll be strictly for a beer."}
{"text":"This is my favorite bar in south end.  They have great fish and chips, rotating monthly specials, live music on Fridays, and British brunch on Sunday's.  They have a projector they lower for big games and hands down this is the best place to watch soccer games in south end.  My most favorite thing about this place though, is its local.  If you live in south end and go here every 2-4 weeks like we do, you'll see the same friendly faces and they'll remember your name (and your drinks).  Very laid back bar with a great neighborhood feel to it - definitely worth five stars."}
