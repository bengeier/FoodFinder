{"text":"I had been coming to this restaurant for over 20 years as this USED to be a great place to eat. However, over the recent years I have been getting HORRIBLE service. I'll have to say I have been treated rudely for quite some time now, and have to unfortunately rate them a 1 star for this. I had introduced many friends to this place before, and they all have mentioned how horrible the service was. 

My latest incident involved my order to me SPOILED. It was pork Sui Mia, and it clearly smelled and tasted sour. My friend and I reported it to the waitresses and all she did was argue with us."}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend and we're both born and bred Hong Kongers craving authentic Chinese food so we had high expectations. The atmosphere was just what a noodle restaurant should be - loud, bustling and casual. I wasn't hungry so I ordered a good ol' chicken congee with the deep fried doughnut. My boyfriend ordered soup noodles with all the goodies - fishballs, char siu and wonton. The food arrived promptly and the portions were very generous. I could only finish a third of my congee bowl although my boyfriend demolished his noodles. 

My congee was good and I was satisfied! My boyfriend was equally satisfied with his noodles. So it's fair to say that our expectations were met and I will definitely be coming back here and ordering something else whenever I feel homesick. 

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Ordered Fried Rice Noodle with Beef, Beef Congee, plate of Gai Lan (Chinese Broccoli with Oyster sauce), and Wonton Noodle Soup.  The only dish with flavour was the fried rice noodle although it was greasier than other similar restaurants like Congee Queen uptown, however the portion was generous.  The small plate of Gai Lan was boiled in some type of meat broth and smelled rancid when we got the plate.  Beef Congee was quite salty with huge thick slices of beef thrown in.  The texture however was good for congee.  The shrimp-pork wontons in the noodle soup were mediocre at best - again the portion was good.  Unfriendly staff and need to pay cash only.  Overall there are much better Congee restaurants uptown but if you're eating in Chinatown the food is decent."}
{"text":"This is as good as it gets folks. Know what to order... I'll help you. Been coming here since I was a kid, and the below dishes are the best of the best:

- wonton soup (don't forget the deep fried donut to go with it)
- soya chicken dish (extra sauce on the side, pour it all over)
- shrimp rice flour roll (best cheung fun in the city, hands down)
- roasted pork (wedding reception quality tonight)

I'd recommend sticking to the above items. Thank me mentally when you're stuffed out of your mind and in a total food coma."}
{"text":"3.75 stars

{"text":"The food wasn't fresh at all, they gave me cold food. Staff is not friendly at all, they didn't greet my mom and I and when the waiter took our order her voice was just cold as stone, expressionless. The only thing that I enjoyed much was the shanghainess dumping, although not like the original taste but it was better than most of the food."}
{"text":"Dropped by this place for lunch because Goldstone down the block doesn't open on Tuesdays.

All I can say is, a very substantial disappointment.  The prices are sky-high for that neighbourhood, a good five to six dollars higher than other places for the same dishes (over $10 for just simple Chinese rice-and-noodle dishes, nothing fancy), and the portions are not any bigger nor the quality noticeably better.  My brisket-and-tendon rice had very little beef tendon, the rice was soggy, and the brisket was so tough and unflavourful that it was much like chewing shoe leather.

The seating was abysmal.  Even though the restaurant was half empty when I arrived, they stuck me at a big table which I had to share with three or four other non-related diners.  It is common restaurant courtesy to allow even a solitary diner to sit at his own table unless the place is full.  What happened here merely made the experience even less appealing.

I haven't tried too many things on this menu so I'm not ruling out that other dishes here might be better.  However, given the very high prices, it would take quite a bit of persuasion to convince me to go back and give this place another shot."}
{"text":"Five stars!!! Best chiness resto EVER!!!
Vous devez essayer ce restaurent de cuisine chinoise traditionnel dans le cur du quartier.  
La cuisine y authentique et fabuleuse!  Quelle expérience!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here at least 10 times, and I've only tried 4 things: seafood with wonton noodle soup, duck noodle soup, shrimp in rice flour, and some fried donut thing.  The seafood with wonton noodle soup is so good that I've ordered that the last 9 times...even though it's one of the most \"expensive\" items at a whopping $8.99.  However, if you're a high roller (like I am), you can't go wrong with this dish.  Not only is it delicious, but it's quite filling as well.  If you're extra hungry and have someone willing to share it with you, I'd recommend getting the fried donut thing on the side.  

My girlfriend always gets the duck noodle soup here, so that's worthy of a mention too.  It's pretty good (and cheaper than the seafood with wonton noodle soup), but I find having bones in my soup annoying, so...

Overall, prices are cheap, food is tasty, and service is generally pretty fast.  Oh yeah, and this place is CASH ONLY, so don't count on using your electronic money here."}
{"text":"Good food, awesome BBQ pork, service is a bit lacking, with never a smile from any of the servers except one nice lady.  The rest look like they just want you to get out.  I go back once in a while for the food, but not the service."}
{"text":"Surprised at the amount of reviews about customer service. 

It's an Asian restaurant, therefore not like the Western service we're all accustomed to. Its different, so you have to be open minded. 

Went with a friend, got a table as soon as we got in. Service was fast... not very friendly, but I don't mind. Food was very good, especially the roasted pork and wonton soup. 

Cash only. Communal dining table - yes."}
{"text":"Wow! Just an amazing restaurant. Everything was so good I don't know where to start off. The jasmine tea you get in the beginning has an amazing taste to it and you don't need to add sugar. Now my 2 favorites were the stick rice and oysters. So if you live or visit here you have to come eat here."}
{"text":"We dined here last night on a whim (after carefully searching through Yelp and Urbanspoon, of course), and have decided this is the go-to location for noodle soups. 

For ~$4.99, I got a bowl of seemingly endless noodles topped with the most interesting cut of barbeque duck that I have ever laid eyes on. I wouldn't count this so much of a 'complaint', than as a 'ponder'... but the cut was along the ribcage, and all the 'slices' of duck were attached by the ribs. Therefore, this would lead me to believe that this was the Mr. Duckie's back. But for $4.99, I'm not feeling particularly malicious about it. Particularly because the barbeque was excellent (though not exactly piping hot- which has been mentioned by previous reviewers). 

The broth in the soups are wonderful. Not too salty or msg-rific, but flavourful. In many Chinese restaurants I usually find their soup broths really meeeh. Not so here- they actually season it. 

So the food is really 'A-OK'. What isn't 'A-OK' (and really I would have rather done two and a half stars, but I've rounded up) is 1. the service and 2. the seating arrangement. 

When I go to a Chinatown anywhere, I always expect to be treated like utter shit. But honestly, my boyfriend had to sit there with his hand up, like in grade school, to get a server's attention for 10 seconds. And 10 seconds was about all we got at one time. It also wasn't clear WHO was our server. The woman who seated us? The woman who took our order? The woman who brought our order? The woman who re-filled our tea? The woman who slapped the cheque on the table? Who am I to flag down, for chrissake!?

As for the seating arrangement... my boyfriend and I endured a lady's conversation with her friend about so-and-so's wedding for the better part of 45 minutes because they were seated a foot away from us. That close, and you feel as if you ought to be part of the conversation, and it's rude if you don't answer!

An inside 'Don't Look Like a Retarded Whitey' tip: if you're going to order donuts... just order 1. Because if you order 2, the server brings two mountainous plates of chopped-up donut bits. We took a lot of it home, of course... but it looked a little odd. \"Do you have any... dipping sauce?\"  **Strange look, shakes head 'No, stupid! **"}
{"text":"Barf...ugh...gag...I make better instant noodles than what they supposedly sell as noodles. Went a few times thinking it may have been a bad day at the tracks for the chef, but consistently bad. 

I'll never go back again."}
{"text":"Great food. BBQ duck milk noodles. This place and House of Gourmet are my go to places for HK style meals. More expensive than restaurants uptown (Markham/Richmond Hill) but living downtown options are limited! Go check this place out."}
{"text":"love the food here. cheap, and very good quality. the BBQ here is also great for takeout. don't be intimidated by the meat hanging in the window. the congee here is excellent- very simple and clean with fresh julienne ginger pieces thrown on top. they even make the fried long doughnuts that go hand in hand with the congee. they make the thin rolled rice noodles here as well which are excellent! 

the service here is really rough around the edges. don't expect the usual friendly and kind service you're use to but they are efficient and get the food out to you fast. they tend to warm up to you the more they see you. 

it gets really busy sometimes and if they need to, they make you sit at a communal table."}
{"text":"I had to give King's Noodle one more star after trying their fried donut/fritter wrapped in rice flour this weekend.  Not usually my favorite dish, my socks were knocked off by the light rice flour surrounding a perfectly fried piece of fritter.  I hear some yelpers think the soya sauce is too \"salty\" - yes, it was salty, but I don't think it detracted from this dish at all (besides I never heard that there is a \"standard\" for the soya sauce applicable to this dish and I've had a lot of HK style cafeteria food).  

The egg noodles were still excellent and the BBQ pork and fatty pork were cut properly this time.  I was concerned that the BBQ pork would be tough because it didn't look to have much fat in it, but it was very tender.  A joy to eat.  

Service is still the usual.  Fast, curt and very efficient - love the way the waiters read my mind.  I didn't have to ask and we got our menus, an extra pair of chopsticks after I dropped mine, our bill, etc.  As far as I'm concerned, if service was like this all the time, I would be happy."}
{"text":"I used to come here religiously every week for years (way before their reno). I loved their food and the service was OK. Four stars.

However, many of my recent visits were extremely dissatisfactory. I came with a group of friends, and our food came about 10 minutes later, all except for one of our friends' order. We tried to get a waiter's attention regarding the matter, and was told it'll come. Thus, everybody started eating.
When most of us were half finished eating, her order still didn't come. We tried getting the attention of several waiters, albeit not a single one gave us their attention.

I might mention that most waitresses here act like as if they hate their lives and really couldn't care less about anybody. This behaviour appears to be consistent, no matter the time of day nor the number of people eating inside.

Well anyway, when we got somebody to confirm her order, most of us were done eating.

The food here is excellent.

I'd rather not eat at a place where I'm full of a load of pissed off instead of the food.

The tea here always tastes like dishwater. Order water instead."}
{"text":"Came in for breakfast and wanted to get something comforting in Chinatown. I was surprised to find that the interior was pretty clean and the walls were covered with colored glass and looked very chic with the exception of the booth chairs that were covered with tape used to fix the holes. 

We ordered the pork blood congee and Hong Kong style congee, not knowing what it was. The pork blood was very smooth and the congee was exceptionally smooth. The youtiao evenly textured and not too oily. The Hong Kong style congee had peanuts and lettuce on top with strips of pig's stomach, fish maw and other very chewy things I couldn't identify. I can't recommend that particular dish, but I would love to come back to try their roast meats.

If you expect friendly service in a casual place like this, then you've never been to China. This place reminded me of similar restaurants in China that I've been to and it's kind of comforting to know that there are places like this here that haven't been corrupted by concepts like hospitality. Eat, get out and quit your whining."}
{"text":"Yum!

Roast duck. BBQ pork. Seafood congee. Wontons. Rice rolls. Soup from the soup noodles that staves off every cold I think I'm getting. If you're a regular (which we are), free Chinese desserts -- _douhua_, red bean soup, green bean soup...

The _youtiao_ aren't always warm, but probably I shouldn't be eating so many of them anyway! But when they are warm, they're great. The dim sum is better than I was expecting, given that they're not a dim sum restaurant. The green veg is often a bit tough or under cleaned, but who comes here for plain green veg??? One sort of feels obliged to have it to make up for all the fried tastiness.

Great as takeout, too. And if you come here regularly enough, the servers WILL smile at you!"}
{"text":"Food: 4.5

Service: -1 ?

Not expecting the servers to be nice (been here many times) but sometimes the food takes forever to come. The BBQ items and vegetables are super delicious though. 

My sister won't eat here anymore after watching one of the chefs scratch himself and eat while cooking, I just thought it was funny."}
{"text":"Always enjoyed food here. Plenty of choice and great value. Best bbq pork downtown. Great Chinese donuts. Little bit cramped by Western standards so make sure you do not mind the Chinese style seating. But it's worth it for the good authentic Chinese food."}
{"text":"The tight, crowded seating means that it's easy to stare longingly at the dishes on nearby tables that you wish you had ordered.  Probably one reason why I returned on multiple occasions.  That and the noodle soups with BBQ anything - large, hearty, and perfect for a student budget.  One of the cleaner joints in Chinatown too."}
{"text":"I think this place is kind of like Great NY Noodletown in Manhattan which I frequent. Cool atmosphere good bbq meats"}
{"text":"If you are craving for a duck, no matter the roasting, just go there!
Even if you don't want duck or you are a duck hater, you will certainly find something you like/love! They have a huge selection of meat, noodles, seafood! Very complete!
The price is very reasonable and the portion are huge! 

I always take out, because the place is always busy... There is only one guy who handles the cash register and take the orders for those who want to take out! But this guy is cool, not too stressed and very polite! You might need to wait for 20mins standing up in the entrance and having the waiters telling you \"sorry\" all the time as in the entrance on the left, they take care of the duck preparation and on the right they take care about boiling and frying vegetables and meats.
I think there is another kitchen in the back!

Anyway although these tiny drawbacks, it is really worth it!

They accept CASH ONLY!"}
{"text":"Food was decent. All the dishes arrived at same time which was nice. The eggplant was a little greasy. Service was average. I would back but not too often"}
{"text":"I've going there for over 20 years...
love it.. best bbq duck in Toronto.
cash only .
Not the best place for a first date, No concept of customer service....but they are fast...don't take it personally when they throw the bill at you and grab the money out of hands.

Just go for the food and a authentic cultural experience."}
{"text":"Can't say I'm a fan. I love Chinese food but I was turned when I had to debone the chicken I had on my plate. I also had the pleasure of the guy next to me spitting the bones from his duck out on the table next to me, lovely. Also maybe it's just my experience but if you're a tourist don't expect to be treated warmly, left for ages before order taken and ignored until they decide you are ready."}
{"text":"Two different people recommended this place to me. I now distrust them.

I ordered a bowl of wonton noodle soup with bbq pork. The pork was good, but every thing else was terrible. The wontons seemed old, the broth was just water and the noodles were filler. If I had just ordered wonton noodle soup I would have been very disappointed.

I wish I had just got the pork over rice."}
{"text":"Thank you to my friend who recommended this place to us! So as the story goes, I was seriously stressed about taking my chinese parents, who don't live in Toronto to a Chinese restaurant. My preference would have been to go to some place in Markham, but logisitically, downtown was easier for all. And, I haven't been downtown in a while so I had no clue where to take them. After many panicked text messages to friends, one fabulous friend recommended King's Noodle. She's been going to Kings since she was little and the place recognizes her family. Perfect. Check mark #1.

From the outside, you don't think much of the place. The store front has roasted pork, chicken and duck hanging in the windows and if you are able to peak past them, you see hurried workers cooking or serving people at the front counter. Hanging food in the window doesn't phase me at all, actually it makes me want to eat! But the old restaurant signage and the general look from the outside didn't make me think this place was going to be anything special.

But when you get INSIDE, that's a different story. The place is modern and clean! Check mark #2. (a disclaimer though, I didn't go to the washroom so I cannot comment on it)

We went for dinner, and the food was also good and came out pretty quick from the kitchen. For 6 adults we were well fed for the fantastic price of $103 + tax and tip. We had: 5 bowls of steamed white rice, a 3 meat BBQ dish (cut from the hanging pork, chicken and duck in the front window), snow pea tips in garlic, General Tao's chicken, sweet short ribs, a seafood dish in a sizzleing cast iron pot, deep fried chili shrimp. They also served us the house soup at the begining of the meal as well as the hot read bean dessert (both for free). So overall, a good meal for a good price. Check mark #3.

The server was also fantastic. She recommended a few dishes for us to try and was nice to my parents. 

Overall, I'd go back again to try more things on the menu. FYI - I think they do all day dim sum. Also, please note, they take cash only!!"}
{"text":"Food is good, went twice in as many weeks with my wife.  After we left the restaurant on our second visit, we realized that they had actually factored in the tip when we got the bill and that we were duped into tipping on top of that.

In summary: pay close attention to how much the food costs and don't let them dupe you into tipping any more."}
{"text":"Ok this is it! THEE place for Chinese in Toronto, or anywhere east of San Francisco and west of NYC.

I have traveled into Canada about once every 6 weeks for the past 10 years or so.  This is my go to when I NEED real Chinese.   There are several legit chinese eateries in Toronto's China Town, but this one is called KING for a reason. Buyer beware: If you enjoy the greasy, salty, surgery, over cooked, noodle dishes made famous in America or most western countries, look elsewhere.  King Noodle Is as authentic as it gets outside main land China.  Whole pigs, ducks, chickens, cuddle fish, assorted innards, and other fair hang freshly cooked in the storefront window.  Anything, and I do mean anything Chinese is available. If its not in the Herman Melville sized menu, just ask. 

Some of the employees speak English. The seating is somewhat communal. Meaning, if you come alone expect to sit at a large table w strangers.  This may seem strange to some, but it's actually quite interesting.  The place is packed nearly all day with local Asians, students, tourists, and the guys who hand out note cards asking for money for the deaf. Yes, as with all huge cities the beggars come out. But relax, they don't push...I digress 

Anyway.  As per other yelp reviews, the BBQ pork is the best Asian style BBQ pork you will find. Tender inside, subtle crisp to the outside and a sauce that isn't too sweet or too spicy. Just right!  The money shot for me though, the Roast pork!  Now if you are a foodie, grew up frequenting pig roasts, or just love real Chinese food, I don't have to go further. To all others, allow me to explain. The roast pork usually comes out room temperature. At first this may set you back, because everything else comes out blazing hot, as fresh food should. To heat it up, just dunk it in a cup of hot broth.  However the thick crispy hairless skin is fried to perfection. If I were to surmise, I'd say they flash fry the pig to crisp the skin and remove any hair. Then they roast it.  WOW swine heaven!  It's the best hands down! The flesh is tender, sweet, and mild. Just enough of that fresh hog taste to remind you you're not eating the bland tasteless grocery store \"pork\" we have so unfortunately come accustom to in the west. But I assure you, it's a real treat! The contrast of the crisp thick skin against the always tender, slightly fatty flesh, is an amalgam of culinary bliss!  I get the porks (bbq AND roast) over steamed thin egg noodles.  It comes with steamed Chinese broccoli. Dumplings too depending on how you order it. But again, the sky is the limit on options. I could eat here every day for a year and literally not try every menu item, it's that diverse. 

All meals come with tea. If you require more than one napkin you will have to ask.

The roast duck, is also very very good.  If you are unfamiliar with water foul, it is all dark meat, buttery and delightful!  The skin is crispy and the flesh is melt in your mouth.  Newbies take note, unless you order the duck Peking style, you will have to naw and nibble around the bones.  Not a problem or even difficult, but good to know if you are new to the scene or have little ones. 

Like others have said, it is recently updated inside, can be elbow to elbow at times, and a little noisy.  However, the dining area appears clean considering the volume they do. Unless otherwise noted , I base my reviews solely on the QUALITY of the meal.

That being said, I give the FOOD at King Noodle 5 stars.  As an amateur chef, food snob, and perfectionist, I award my business only to places that earn it or I cook myself, to which I am quite adroit.

When you're in the big T.O., and you crave real, authentic, high quality, ethnic, Chinese foods, you owe it to your taste buds to dine here.  Yelpers, I know we have all been tricked by the \"5 star\" review before.  As far as the food only goes, this gets a fair 5.  ENJOY!"}
{"text":"My favorite, always there and open when you need a good hot dish or quick noodles dish.  Nice and clean, and good service!!"}
{"text":"The hanging BBQ and the noodle cook in the windows drew me into this place among all the other restaurants in Chinatown. I was only a party of one so they asked me to sit at a large round table with two strangers. This as fine as there was plenty of space in between us. Once seated, a pot of tea quickly showed up in front of me.  I ordered the \"roast duck BBQ pork wonton noodle soup\" that ended up to be about $10 including tax. The wontons were large and flavorful with pork and big pieces of shrimp. The soup noodles were perfectly done, \"crunchy\" as my mom would say in Chinese, which is a good thing. The roast duck was flavorful and so was the BBQ pork. A bonus was that there were a few pieces of shanghai bok choi in the bowl too, which rounds it out nicely.  The bowl didn't look that large, but it was densely packed, so before I got to the bottom of the bowl, I was more than full. Overall, a satisfying meal in a somewhat typically chinatowny frenetic environment."}
{"text":"As we walked in, the place was packed to capacity which is always a good sign.  I was so entralled/mesmerized by the production/hustle bustle at the front of the house (the bbq counter take-away and the noodle deepfried station at the front) that the wait staff had to tap me on the arm to get my attention to seat us.

As we got seated, one of the waitresses smiled/said hi and dumped two greasy menus in front of us. I was shocked that someone actually smiled/said hi in chinatown.

Although i was starved and confused by the huge selection - everything looked so delicious since i was starving at this point, I finally selected the bbq duck noodle soup. Price is reasonable $4.95+tax/tip. The food arrived quickly.  As we dug into the food, we both realised the bbq duck was so good we could not stop eating to talk.

They make their deep fried dough in house.  You can see it as you enter the resto from the front. They also have this fried dough wrapped in a thin layer of rice dough/dried shrimp/chives that looked really delicious.

I recommend the bbq duck & the roasted bbq pork.  The dumplings look really good too as they look that they are made in-house."}
{"text":"The Toronto Lover system:
5 stars = Must visit!

Let's not be needlessly sensitive: a lot of Canadian people go to Chinese restaurants because they want fast cheap food, and a lot of people go to Chinese restaurants because they want Chicken Balls and Chow Mein.

If you're the kind of person who gets excited when you see groups of Chinese people eating Chinese food, including Chinese families, then King's Noodle is a sure visit. They offer hundreds of dishes, but all revolve around the same concept: meat, seafood, or vegetables on rice or noodles. Or, even better: meat, seafood, or vegetables in a soup filled with noodles.

The BBQ pork and duck are sweet and well roasted. Favourites like BBQ Pork on rice ($5) or noodles with squid ($6) or BBQ pork noodle soup ($6) will do you right. Try the fried bread donut for a guilty pleasure and dunk pieces in your soup.

The tea is right, the service is cold but efficient, and the dishes are consistently good. For real Toronto Chinatown, you can't beat the King.

4 stars"}
{"text":"The food here is below average and the service is exceptionally bad. We've been here a couple of times and it hasn't improved. 

Today, our BBQ pork was served cold and the noodles tasted like they were sitting in the kitchen overnight. Also, the waiters basically grunt at you (we speak mandarin so it's not a language issue). Today the lady at the cash made me sit and wait to pay as she was doodling something on a piece of paper, didn't even look up, took my money and gave me 2$ less than I was supposed to get back. Needless to say, that was their tip."}
{"text":"The place is clean and they have good service. The curry beef is worth a try - not spicy atall and very flavourful. Top it with the chilli oil from the table and you get the right amount of kick.

My friend's ordered a duck with rice and it too was not all that bad."}
{"text":"This was not my first time here but had been 4 years since last time. The service was even more horrible than I remembered and the food quality had deteriorated quite abit, did not make up for the bad service. 
Cheated us in the exchange from American to Canadian, so if going bring Canadian, never before had a waitress ask for tip for crappy service... just told her we needed change and she commented \"It is at least 10%.\" Actually she got nothing... I don't reward very poor service and substandard food"}
{"text":"Amazingly delicious Chinese food in Toronto Chinatown. You definitely pay a premium but it is worth it. This is the best bbq pork that I've had in Canada."}
{"text":"We decided to eat here around dinner time on Saturday. The restaurant was packed but the servers did their best to give quick and friendly service. 

The food was a little overpriced for Chinese food. We ordered bbq pork dry noodles which didn't come with enough noodles but the pork was good (a little fatty). The Kung pao chicken was flavourful but not very spicy at all. 

Overall a good experience for Chinese food at dinner time in downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"3.5 stars
I've actually never dined-in, but this is where I usually take-out roast pork and BBQ pork when the craving hits.  

Their roast pork is superb, and they're usually accommodating if you have a preference for either lean or fatty.  The skin remains crispy unlike some other BBQ take-out places where the skin gets soggy.

The take-out counter is clean, service efficient, and they have digital sign boards that clearly spell out the prices.  

The only thing is that they tend to cut the orders on the generous side.  If you ask for 1 lb of BBQ pork for example, they'll likely give you more and ask if it's OK (as they're weighing it).  It's when you pay that you realize that perhaps it's way too much!  (Luckily, left overs make great fried rice!)

I've tried a few other places in Chinatown for Chinese BBQ, and have decided that the quality and service is most consistent at King's Noodle.  Perhaps one day, I'll even dine-in!"}
{"text":"Descent food but maybe the worst service in Toronto.  I've been about 10 times over the years and finally I've HAD IT!  Each waitresses has more attitude than the last. I was alone and they would only seat me at community table, which looked like it was being used by some homeless people. It wasn't that busy so I offered to wait.  The server would only respond \"You alone. You no get table\" Then just looked past me like I was invisible.  I tried to speak with another server and everyone just looked away like I was crazy.  All I could say was \"but....but....I wait\".  So embarrassing and awkward.  A couple of my friends have also written this place off because of the bad service.  Now I see why.  They really are arrogant with their clients.  Ended up going to Phohung up the street.  Should have gone there first."}
{"text":"I fell in love with this restaurants for years!i like Their BBQ style almost everything(even duck wings and chicken feet)And honestly ,the wAitresses there looked kinda mean ,but actually treated me super good !when I ordered too much food,they even kindly reminded me."}
{"text":"Great food. They are known for their cheap wonton soup, only $4.50 and it can come with a different meat if you want. The wontons are delicious. It's decently filling too, not some tiny bowl of nothing. If you want a really large bowl, they offer that for a bit more too.
The service is not what would be considered \"good\" but is typical Chinese. The attitude is not friendly but they get you what you ask for in a timely matter, so who really cares. It's how Chinese culture is and should be expected at these types of restaurants."}
{"text":"$11 for a 1/4 of a duck. Wonton noodles soup with barely any shrimp.  Dishes are much smaller.  The food is good but no longer a good deal imo."}
{"text":"Good Service, Good Food, Good Price. 

King's Noodle got to pick only two and it picked food and price. It's delicious and really cheap but you won't get any service unless you stand up on the table and light a flare to have the waiter come to you."}
{"text":"Food was always good, some dishes are priced very competitively, while some are not.  So check out the prices before you order.  I especially like their BBQ pork, roast duck, and roast pork. If you like your roast pork or bbq pork a tiny wee bit fatty, you can tell them you want it a bit fatty, not all lean, which is super yum. I went to UofT for school and this is definitely one of my fave restaurants in that hood.  I even saw one of the famous Asian chef in Toronto there once, maybe he was checking out the food too !  

The only thing I am not comfortable with this place is that the tables can be too close to each other and I felt like I was sharing my food with some strangers.   I tend to go during off peak hours to avoid the crowds."}
{"text":"I would recommend not going there. The congee was full of MSG, the bits of meats in it are not entirely pork and positively tasted funky. The thousand yr eggs inside the soup was tasteless and very low quality. The you tiao (they call it fried donut) was cold and soggy. The roasted duck with this glossy corn starch sauce had an odd texture that did not taste even taste like duck. The choy... Where do I start... Was so muchy and wilted. I have nothing remotely good to say about the food."}
{"text":"If you like noodle soup with a FLY in it, then this is the place to go. I'm serious, my better half and I both ordered a noodle soup and both of us had a fly in each of our orders. 

And besides from the FLY in our food, seriously why is this place getting 4 stars? I'm Chinese who grew up with these type of restaurants and I don't even like the food here and find it a tad bit more expensive than other places in Chinatown. Your best alternative is Goldstone down a block!"}
{"text":"Based purely on the sliced beef congee and the rice flour roll with donut!

Pure deliciousness.  The donut was crisp and complemented the congee well.  Just go try it and you'll enjoy it very much.  Trust!

My Persian and Korean friends had some and enjoyed it very very much also =)"}
{"text":"Roast duck wonton noodle soup! Awesome!"}
{"text":"Top notch Chinese food in the heart of Chinatown. I cannot even describe the love I have for this restaurant, I've been going here since I first arrived in Toronto (2005) and I always come back for their delicious food that never changes. I have noticed that more and more non Chinese people are discovering this place, which is great! I hope they make more branches in Toronto :)

What to expect.
-The restaurant is casual,  can be at times loud and really a place just to eat.  The waitresses do not speak english too well, but are quick and efficient for such a busy restaurant.

-No debit or credit, so bring the cash! (you pay upfront after you eat btw)

-Washrooms are not the best, can be dirty but like I said, their restaurant is just a place to eat and nothing else.


What to get
1. Wonton in Noodle Soup. Absolutely the dish to have if you're looking for a cheap way to get full, about 4$ for a flavourful soup enough for 2 people to share, but 1 if you're really hungry.
 
2. Any Congee dishes. Even though Congee is not my favourite dish, my dad claims it is the best place in Chinatown to get it .

3. Any BBQ/Soy/Roasted meat dishes, are almost perfect (it can be a bit greasy at times) and goes perfect with their scallion ginger dip (make sure you ask for it)

**All the above dishes go perfectly with their perfect garlic chili dip found on every table**"}
{"text":"Very good, price is reasonable. Not the best. I had the wonton noodles and they were good but nothing out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"The preserved egg & pork congee here was sooo satisfying! I really needed some congee after going home sick from work.  The prices are reasonable, for 11 dollars, I got 2 containers of congee and 4 sticks of the fried dough fritters.
The congee had lots of big slices of egg.  

Not sure how the dim sum or other food tastes here though..."}
{"text":"It's my favorite China Town haunt. At first I was frightened by the carnage in the window but if you don't look, and are able to pretend it's plastic you can actually enjoy the food. The dim sum is ok, the portions are generous and the prices are fantastic. Writing this review is making me think about eating Black Bean Chicken. It's good. Simple and fast."}
{"text":"Have the rudest server ever. I ordered rosted pork with ribs and gave me just rosted pork. Complained and the server came at the front and talk to the other server. She came back and told me that they dont have ribs anymore. Sure, whatever! I can definitely see ribs hanging at fhe front. Then they always give me my bill when i'm not even halfway done my food. This restaurant should have a good customer training!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this restaurant for as long as I can remember. Personally, it's become a Toronto landmark. Whether you're sober and hungry, drunk and hungry, or hungover and hungry, the food here will more often than not comfort you and satisfy your appetite.

An important thing to remember though is that you are coming here for the food, not the service or dining experience. The servers can be brisk and fast paced, but that's just because they work very hard and have a fairly busy house to serve. Most of the waiters have been serving here for as long as I can remember as well, so they don't play around or sugar coat things.

Overall, food is good, prices are low for a personal meal and moderate for a group/family meal, usually open pretty late. Keep in mind that it's CASH ONLY but it's located beside a scotiabank and across the street from other banks."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place in TO Chinatown.  Good, fill 'em up diner food."}
{"text":"I left my black leather Michael Kors gloves at King's Noodle. I called the next day to see if I could get them back. I waited on  the phone for 1 minute and 47 seconds. Nobody answered and I hung up. 
I had #48, bbq duck and wonton soup. I ate it fast. It tasted very good. Very good."}
{"text":"I have had many terrible experiences with this place but by far this one was the worst. Also, if you're asking why I still continue to go it's because my boyfriend loves the place so I just get the soup now. One time I found a hair on my noodle, pulled it out and there was what looked to be a dusty bunny attached to the entire noodle. Another time, through the window I saw the chef picking her nose. This last experience yesterday has crossed the line. In the little room, beside the window where they put the food, I saw COCKROACHES. It wasn't one, not two but THREE going in and out of the creek of the wall walking around each other like nothing. This was in the little room next to the window where they put the food out and staff eats. Under it, was a lady eating calmly as the cockroaches walked on the wall above her head. They were literally walking IN AND OUT OF THE CREEK CHASING EACHOTHER OR WHATEVER. I was so repulsed I didn't even eat anything there. Disgusting. I would have taken a video if the lady wasn't staring at me. Do yourself a favour and stay away from this place. If you do go, sit at the very end of the restaurant in the corner booth and stare into the room. You will see with your own eyes what I'm talking about."}
{"text":"GOOD AND CHEAP FOOD (for the most part).

HORRIBLE SERVICE.

But hey, the first part makes up for the second so I still like coming here!"}
{"text":"Do expect stellar service but look past that and get the BBQ duck and roasted pork...then all poor service issues will melt away!"}
{"text":"Their crisp pork is a must if you never had one. The bbq duck is ok. The meat is quite salty. The fat layer under the skin is quite thick and made me feel sick after a few tries. 

Their plain congee is FANTASTIC!!!! Simple but great. My friend thinks they put egg white in it. Maybe that is the reason why it tastes so good. Also a hint of mung bean. Will come back for their congee!"}
{"text":"Food's average but hopefully you won't get the nasty older waitress with the glasses.. serious attitude problem."}
{"text":"A review from New York :)

I came here last year in May. It's a decent place. The memorable thing from this restaurant was the AC. The air conditioning was a blast! I was really cold because I was wearing shorts. The roasted duck noodles (lai fun) was quite good."}
{"text":"This place has consistent food quality, price is a bit higher than other similar Canton restaurant. Services are just so so. They did decoration quite sometime ago, I think it looks clean and bright."}
{"text":"My favorite chinese restaurant in Toronto. I've been going here since before they had their own branded cutlery and dishes, since before their renovations, I practically grew up on this chinese food. Highly highly recommend it, here is why:

Food: 5/5 - from congee, to fried rice, to dry noodle, to soup, to their bbq duck, pork and chicken. To their vegetable dishes to their appetizers I've had them all. And none of them disappoint. MAYBE their garlic snowpea leaves can be a bit oily, perhaps on some occasions they give you smaller than average cuts of bbq duck on your wonton dry noodle on duck, but to practically grow up on this food I've never had one big complaint about the taste and will always always come back for the comfort of the chinese dishes they serve.

As an aside, I wouldn't recommend this place for vegetarians as they are few pure vegetarian items on thier vast menu :(

Cost: 5/5 - wooo one of the best parts is the price! Ok not dirt cheap, but decently priced for the high quality food you get here :)

Service: 3.5/5 - could be more friendly, needs some reminders at times (for water, for forks and not chopsticks etc etc), but its always been like that. Some of the waitresses that have been working here I still recognize from the first time I came... I wonder if they recognize me too (?) Bahahhha!

Ambience: 4/5 - since they renovated its been a much nicer place to eat in! Like I mentioned earlier their chopsticks and dishes are branded so they've definitely invested alot into branding their restaurant. Don't expect a fancy dining experience of any kind, but it is clean and updated to feel more modern than most chinese restaurants :)

When the food vs. cost outshine that of everything else, this restaurant in my opinion is a 5/5 overall. Highly recommended to locals and visitors of Toronto :)"}
{"text":"I always come back to this place especially for their BBQ items.  Their BBQ pork is nice and juicy, and the roast pork has a nice crunchy skin.  Portions are good and the prices are good.  Service is also quite decent.

The other menu items are also quite good for casual dining, and their dim sum is decent enough for a simple meal."}
{"text":"When I'm feeling homesick or crave some noodles, I always like to visit King's Noodle Restaurant! 

The House Special friend noodles has everything - seafood, veggies and meat over crispy fried noodles - yumm-ee!! :)

When I'm sick, I order their congee with thier crispy donut to dip - good comfort food! My grandparents would be proud. 

I've always gone to eat solo, service is quick and efficient! Would definitely recommend this place to others!
 
Cheers!

{"text":"Visited twice on my recent visit to Toronto.  Went there first with my sisters and then with my parents, both late night grub experiences.  Had the hot and sour soup and then the seafood congee (aka \"gook\") which was super!   Chocker block full of shrimp, scallops, and all things fishy.   I'm a vegetarian now so a lot of my old time favourites I had to turn down, but it was ok and I survived.  Plenty on the menu to satisfy a greener diet.

I do have to bring up something wierd and pretty typical asian - we got there with my sisters and mum & dad, and they sat us at the same round table as this poor guy, who was already eating.  He had to endure our family's bickering and banter....I felt bad.  (He did speed up his eating and left pretty quickly.)"}
{"text":"Hands down my favourite Chinese restaurant in Toronto (besides Swatow). 

Love the wonton noodle soup, number 235 (fried noodle with spicy shrimp and pork), oysters with ginger and onion, duck on rice!

Omg! I seriously love it! I feel like this place is seriously my biggest weakness!"}
{"text":"Clean restaurant and washroom, quick service. I got the roast pork and wonton soup noodle. No pressure to order or leave which is common amongst other Chinatown restaurants. Food was a bit salty and you can only pay in cash. Pricier end of Chinese food in the area."}
{"text":"Best spot in Chinatown, been going here for years. Always reliable chow at affordable prices"}
{"text":"I was a regular here as a child since I used to come with my dad for their famous wonton noodle soup, but stopped coming as an adult because the food and service has gone downhill and my palate had changed.  Plus the decor was outdated and sometimes not very hygienic. 

That has changed since they renovated the place many years ago and the food is up to caliber again. With the modern decor, the place doesn't look as run down as it ussd to be and is probably one of the cleanest and decent restaurants in Chinatown. 

The service is fast and efficient like most Chinese restaurants,  and staff are not always friendly,  but that's not a big deal because when you're hungry, you just want food quick.

Portions are good sized and priced well.  Definitely a go-to place if you want Chinese comfort food like noodle soups, congee, plus their roasted ducks are probably one the tastiest in Chinatown. 

Don't let the meats hanging in the front window deter you.  Food is worth the try for the price and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I can eat the slightly above average food at the beginning but after a visit to their bathroom, I kinda lost my appetite."}
{"text":"Based on my last and final visit, this place is boycotted.  I've never come across such ignoramus cows.  To be yelled at while arms flailing when trying to get service and then being lied to is not how a paying customer should be treated. Some of the servers in this place are miserable and intolerant.  Disgusting human beings."}
{"text":"This place is good;  however,  there are some things i was wary about.  To good things first,
1.   Steamed bass with soy sauce and scallions was delicious.
2.   Bbq duck was off the chart.
3.   Snow pea shoots was delectable.
4. Roast pork, bbq pork, hakaw, fried chicken wings: I can't recommend them.
5. Service was okay.  You have to be aggressive in getting their attention.   

The wary part:
We did not get a receipt breaking down the charges for our meal.  They just told us how much was the total of our bill."}
{"text":"\"The one with the Hong Kong styled interior.\"

The Good:
Relatively good food quality compared to other downtown Toronto Chinese restaurants; cleaner look than some of the others; resembles a typical modern Hong Kong style restaurant in the interior (i.e. organization of the restaurant + the decor); good \"oil sticks\"

The Bad:
A little pricier than your other Chinese restaurants in the area; typically gets very packed (long wait-times); often have to share tables (\"Dap Toy\") during peak times or wait longer

Overview:
Out of all the Chinese restaurants I've eaten at Downtown Toronto (I've livined on campus for three years just north of Spadina and College), King's Noodles has consistently delivered above average quality food for a downtown Chinese restaurant. Maybe it's just me, but I'd generalize that your typical Chinese restaurant on Spadina can't compete with those uptown, but that's my opinion. However, King's Noodles comes close. Interior styling is nice, resembling your typical Chinese fast-eat in Hong Kong (mirrors on the side, cashier and oil sticks prepared in the front) which I found to be different than other places on Spadina, plus it looked cleaner too. The floors weren't overly sticky like places nearby that I've tried (i.e. Goldsor, which I'll review later on).

Food quality is pretty good; we went as a group of 5 the first time we went and I ordered the large BBQ pork on rice. if you've had BBQ pork many times before you'll know that every restaurant has a different taste and sometimes you'll get those that are more crunchy while others are more soft and moist. This placed served the latter, which is pretty good but I prefer the more crunchy/harder ones. Others had the same, with some having soy sauce chicken instead. Overall, we all found it to be much better than others in the area. We also shared a seafood congee which we liked very much with the oil sticks. However, it was our first time and we didn't know how much one serving was so we ordered 5, one for each person. Well, suffice it to say it was too much: one serving could easily be enough for 3 people so we were left with oil sticks to  take home (=. Some might find it to be very oily but hey, it's not often you have good Chinese food on Spadina (again, at least in my opinion and my friends). Lunch came out to be about $11 each, with my BBQ pork costing around $9 tax in but yeah, we were stuffed. Waiters and waitresses are typically running around frantically but overall service pretty standard. You pay up at the front at the cashier and the funny thing is they have a drop off box for tips which all tips goes in to. I'm not sure how then do they split the tips, maybe evenly but maybe this is why service across the board was pretty good.

They also have a dim sum menu to for lunch but I've only ordered a few things from it in addition to my regular lunches (in the cases where I came from a 5 consecutive hour of classes!) and I was starving. Prices for dim sum are a little higher than others though, maybe even a little higher than those uptown (say, Golden Court), and quality was OK, nothing exceptional.

Overall, I'd rate this higher than my other reviews but only because relative to what you have available on Spadina, this is probably the best places. Definitely give it a shot if you're in China town and want some food quality reminiscent of uptown restaurants with a pretty comfy decor.

{"text":"The restaurant must have best roast duck and the curry chicken was delicious.  Fast and friendly service."}
{"text":"Have come here for years and have to admit it has been pretty consistent in terms of quality of foods, service and prices. Very tasty bbq, noodles and other cantonese staples. Reasonable prices. Good variety so there's something for everyone. Nice!"}
{"text":"I go here for a cheap good and quick chinese food fix. 
You get your food quickly.
And your bill quickly.
Washrooms are gross, but that's not anything new.
Service is terrible, but as expected.
Tables are tight, really tight. But its okay, because I can sit eat & go in record time."}
{"text":"My wife was craving noodles, so we decided to give the King's Noodle a try. We had the BBQ Pork & Duck Leg noodles. The duck was cold but flavourful, and the BBQ pork was amazing. The noodles had a sweet flavour to them and the soup was alright. Craving fixed, but nothing to rave about."}
{"text":"Saturday Afternoon: Was there for a lunch takeout. I am not going to comment on the service, just going to talk about the food and overall cleanliness.

Firstly, I ordered the char siew rice bowl and the char siew low mein. Seemed like their roast offerings was more popular so one for me, and one for my friend. I honestly did not look at the takeout menu. I was asked what size I wanted for my rice bowl and of course I I got the small portion and boy, it was small. The reviews raved about how big their portions were but man, mine was sooooo small it was served in a hamburger container. It cost 3.99. Cheap, but no value.  I was not impressed at this $3.99 excuse for a meal. No vegetables either, just a hamburger sized container with cheap rice and sauced char siew. Bad business decision.

The char siew low mein was delicious, but for 10.99 was overpriced. Very little veggies. Not much noodles.  No value.

Chefs were eating while cooking. Serious health regulation infringement. To make things worse, they ate with their hands, and then carried on to make fried dough fritters. Nice... 

Not going back. Ever... Such serious neglect for public health on the outside open kitchen only leaves you wondering what the heck they do inside their main kitchen."}
{"text":"I love coming here for the food is really flavorful.  Here are my picks:

     BBQ duck wonton noodle soup with egg noodle.  - I get the soup separated with the rest                     and add the beef brisket sauce.  
     Thousand-year-old congee with fried doughnut

The BBQ pork is really flavorful and hardly have any fat.  The service is on par with other Chinese restaurant.  The server takes your order, bring you the food, and provide you with the check.  Nothing more and nothing less."}
{"text":"There are roast ducks hanging in the window, so it's relatively straightforward to figure out what you should order if you wander into King's Noodle Restaurant: duck noodles!  Mine were really good, with the right amount of yummy duck greasiness that I miss on cold Winter days in Europe.

The ambiance is what you'd figure from the sign, but who cares?  Definitely make it here for dinner sometime if you're in Toronto for a little while."}

Extra information:

*Center of Chinatown
*Specialize in BBQ meats
*Gets really busy during lunch time

If you are craving Chinese food, where better to go than Chinatown? King's Noodle House is located in heart of Chinatown and they specialize in BBQ meats and noodles. It gets very busy during lunch hour so make sure to get there early to beat the lunch crowd. Even before walking in, you can see all the yummy looking BBQ meats in the display case. 

Although I got there before 12:30, I still had to wait around 30 minutes to be seated. However, the table turnover is very quick so it's not so bad waiting around. There is no waiting area so you have to form a line between the BBQ station and Congee/Noodle/Donut station. They make all the noodles at the front so the waitress had to keep on walking through the line of people waiting to grab food- and this is never good when there are so many people standing around and the waitress is standing there with bowls of hot noodle soup.

Ordered: YEUNG CHOW FRIED RICE - Fried rice is big in portion with lots of shrimp. This was good with hot sauce that is provided on the table.

Ordered: BEEF BRISKET & TENDON NOODLE SOUP - This was a big disappointment. It looked good when it first came with lots of meat/tendon pieces as well as fresh vegetables. However, the soup was very watery and the noodles were too thin and hard to soak up the soup. Meat pieces were tender and tendons were very chewy, but the noodles just didn't do it for me. I would not get this again.

Ordered: BBQ DUCK ON NOODLES - This was one of their popular dishes avail. Same type of noodles are used for every noodle dish they have but this was good with the BBQ duck. I just wish it came with more meat to balance out the dish though. Soup was good on the side.

SUMMARY: I would come back to this place, maybe earlier during the weekday so I don't have to wait so long. I want to try BBQ pork next time!"}
{"text":"I had duck and pork noodle soup and it was great lots if duck and pork . I like this place . Bonus they open at 9am great place for breakfast but don't go in there if you want pancakes and coffee at 9am."}
{"text":"It's a typical Hong Kong type joint, where the waitresses has no knowledge of customer service or greeting.. All grumpy and unfriendly. 

Besides that my family and I (2adults 3 kids), ordered roast pork on rice, roast duck on rice, roast duck leg and roast chicken leg on rice, wonton noodles soup and a prawn soy paper roll. The price came up to be $38, my husband didn't give exact cash, and the waitress just took it that all the extras were for her tip, and wanted to keep it all. Hmm.. 

The prawn soy paper roll was a huge disappointment! Prawns were not fresh, and the rice paper was way too thick! By far the worse I've eaten in the 3 continents of Chinese food I've tried! 

The roast pork on rice wasn't that great as all the reviews had suggested. It was indeed crispy.. But was way too salty! 

The rest of the dishes were fine.. Not too bad comparing to what we've tried prior. I've to say their wonton noodles soup was the best valued meal. It has nice chucks prawns in the wonton and it's only $4.50 for a decent size bowl! And it was tasty!"}
{"text":"I'd like to give King's Noodle 3.75 stars, but can't quite justify rounding it up to 4 stars. Store front may fool you because lots of various barbequed and roasted items hang in the window to entice passerby and to being nostalgia for my younger days of going to Chinatown in LA with my grandmother. But once you walk in, the decor is rather modern and the dining area is pretty clean and orderly (can't say the same for the bathrooms). Since this was a mid-afternoon/pre-dinner snack, the hubby and I split a bowl of wonton egg noodle soup with roasted duck and barbequed pork, YUM. The broth is delicious, full, and had just the right amount of fat content that kept it from going over the side of \"greasy.\" For a special treat, we also ordered the shrimp rice rolls with special soyo sauce. Yummmmmmm, I was craving this for days while I was visiting Toronto, but unfortunately did not get to relive this bit of glory. Some of the meats can be pretty fatty; I know some people enjoy that. Eat with lots of water: the MSG digests more easily with liquids."}
{"text":"This place looks a lot nicer than the last time I went in.  It's actually clean (compared to 90% of the Chinatown restaurants) and the decor is more modern.  I'm not sure if I miss the old look or not.  The old look was more of a yes we know the place is looks like a dive but the food is still pretty good!

Anyways onto the food here.  I might be the only crazy person reviewing this place for what it's supposed to be but....I decided to get the noodles...at a noodle restaurant.  That is pretty much when I go to King's.  The noodles are fresh, the soups are exactly what they should be and the items that you get in your noodles are pretty fresh.  The price is still cheap and the service is pretty fast.  

I'd venture out to try other things on the menu...but then why not go to another restaurant that is definitely better at making those items, unless I were to get a stellar review for an item on the menu?"}
{"text":"Stay away. Tourist trap - It is somehow rated 4 stars on Tripadvisor, totally misleading. The food is terrible quality and the taste isn't there either. We got prawn har gao, wonton soup, garlic fried seasonal veges and a mixed bbq meats with rice. The bill came to $65 for 2 people!!!!! I challenged the cashier, the docket was written in Chinese so I couldn't understand what I was being charged for. She was like ohh sorry and brought the bill down to $55. They only accept cash, so of course they have their own ATM machine. Avoid at all cost, terrible food, terrible service and crazy  overpriced. Never again"}
{"text":"Came here for a quick meal and usually they give free soup when u spend over $20,but today I had to ask and ask and they seemed not too happy for for giving out soup . I realized that many time I come here, they only they soup to their usual HK clients."}
{"text":"I have been going here for a long time. I have also been to many other Asian restaurants in the US and in China and I do not care about the service being sub par to common American/Canadian service which I find at times to be overzealous and annoying. I enjoy the food and the prices at King Noodle but I will never be back again.

The last time I went and was confused about where to sit, I did not speak Chinese back to the waitress. She called me a \"Slow Idiot\" loudly in Cantonese figuring that I did not understand her.

On another occasion when I was paying my bill a waitress said \"This is the bill, but does not include tip\"
She knows that you are not supposed to tip Chinese restaurants like this one. That is why she and her friends are allowed to be so rude to the customers, throw their ordered food on the table and pretend to ignore them. Furthermore, why would I want to tip her anyways, treated me like trash? 

NOTE: for those who are unfamiliar with this culture - you are NOT supposed to tip in places like King Noodle when the service is noticeably rude. [side note: I am not saying to NEVER tip in ANY Asian restaurant. Just don't tip in King Noodle] Places like King Noodle do not rely on tips to stay in business and are keen to take advantage of the generous American/Canadian culture to amplify their profits.

My suggestion for tipping at ANY restaurant: Does this service that I got today deserve a tip? And how much? Then tip that amount."}
{"text":"Well, I was pretty disappointed. 
The interior is nice and clean, I expected the food would be a blast after reading blogto and other reviews. 

The biggest disappointment was that the meal I ordered was completely cold when it arrived (chicken bbq with rice). This should never happen in a restaurant. Needless to say that my boyfriend got his meal cold as well (duck bbq with rice). The other thing is that the portion was pretty small.

The service was ok I guess. Did not feel the urge to hurry up with eating, pay and leave. So that was a plus."}
{"text":"Good wonderful place.. Delicious duck must try. It is so cheap and affordable, the wonton soup is like 5$ with noodles and meat. Try out the goose as well, it's unique but a good taste. Their congee is also a nice treat if you are into rice pourage."}
{"text":"This is a good Chinese food, I would say is quite Hong Kong style Chinese Food, we've this restaurant for few years. Although we are not regular customer, but we go there at least once a month.
But, we had a very bad experience yesterday night- March 14,2017 around 7:30pm.
We ordered three dishes as usual, the total bill was $48.75. Tax included. When i checked the bill we have noticed that there was $5.00 extra. So we asked cashier/ waiter what is extra $5.00 for. She replied that our bill was over $50.00, that is the tips. Then, she walked away , i checked the meau and any notice place on the wall. The answer is nothing. 

Then, my husband paid the bill at the front desk and he was keep asking why there is extra $5.00 in the bill. She just kept ignored him and my husband asked her for the receipt, she refused to give him a proper receipt, she only painted out a slip ftom the cashier mavhine, there was only numbers on it, no restaurant name erc.

The reason I posted this incident here, because I don't want there is another victim like us. This is not the matter of the extra $5.00, no matter what we always paid 15% tips.  We felt this is dishonest behavior and  cheating in order to boost up their tips and I won't go back anymore and I don't recommend anyone going there too."}
{"text":"Do not come here if you care about service.  However, if you like good food, don't be a stranger.  Like literally cause they like to seat strangers together at a large table if they are running out of smaller tables.  They ask you if it's alright first.  

If you already know about how good the roast duck is, then you need to try the roast goose (seasonal).  This is like having McD's burger and then having a REAL burger.
It's leaner and just as tasty.  Unlike the duck which I also love, there is no fat between the skin and meat.  It's seasoned the same way so you will not miss the duck when you eat the goose.

If you've tried the soya chicken, the next step up is the ginger chicken.  This is not to be found in the window display which is why its taken me years (i wish I could turn back time as I've eaten this twice since I first tried the chicken 2 weeks ago) before trying.  I saw it on the menu and they pointed me to the overhead refrigerated cabinet thingy with the glass door showing yellow and regular steamed chickens.  She told me the yellow on is the ginger chicken and the Chinese name sounds like something we call walking chicken in Vietnamese.  The meat on this type of chicken is not as dry as regular chicken.  They've brined this ginger chicken- guaranteed.  It's the most moist, flavorful bird I've ever eaten.  

They are skimpy on the ginger - green onion oil dips.  I've noticed that if I tell them to feel free to charge me extra - they will give me less attitude and more dip (its a win-win).  Plus (I've yet to see the extra charge on my bill ;-p).  

I prefer the oyster sauce and lettuce over the Chinese broccoli which is sometimes overcooked.  It sounds weird but somehow, when you dip iceberg lettuce in boiling water/broth for a few seconds, remove and drizzle oyster-flavored sauce on top it becomes a nice lightly crunchy veggie. It is easily one of my favorite simple veggie sides.  The must-try fried rice is their shrimp and chicken friend rice with cream and tomato sauce.  They top the fried rice with two different sauces.  One is a sweet and sour tomato based sauce and the other is a creamy (egg white based?) sauce.  I could eat that once a week for the rest of my life."}
{"text":"We had 4 people and ordered 5 dishes included spicy fried shrimp, 3 styles bbq, eggplant with tofu and ground pork, congee, rice roll stuffed with chinese donuts. We paid $80 (tips included). The food was delicious but the atmosphere was too noisy then we had to talk loudly to able to hear each other. Spaces between tables were small so every time waiters passes by, they collied with our table."}
{"text":"Probably closer to a 2.5 star. 

Felt the need for a bowl of congee and meandered my way to King's Noodle. Ordered the pork and preserved egg, and an order of har gao (which wasn't on the menu per se, but pics of dim sum delicacies were at the front of the menu and sure enough when asked, dim sum was available to order). 

Congee was $5, nice consistency and good pieces of egg and pork... but was underwhelmed by the flavour. Har gao wrapper was way too thick and chewy, and I really should have thought twice about ordering something that wasn't detailed on the menu. 

I will be back, only to try some of the barbeque and give this place a second chance."}
{"text":"Great food, hands down!  Use this place as a night cap when I'm in the T!  Best way to end a night.  Not to expensive(like most of the area) and open late!  Love the all day dim sum and the deep fried pastrys, ummmmmmm they are to die for!  Going here this weekend and I can't wait to go here!

Only knock on this place like every other Chinese restaurants is the bathrooms, but on a scale of 1 to 10 on importance, bathrooms are about a 2.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"King's Noodle House located in One of Toronto's Chinatown's offered some spectacular duck! 
My boyfriend and I visited this place twice as the first time was not exactly how we envisioned it. 

After hearing so many great things about this place from the one and only Andrew Zimmern, we went right over! The lines were long and the staff were super busy. In fact, there was so many people in there that we anticipated returning following day. However, the staff were good at getting patrons in and out. 

After waiting online for about 15-20!minutes we were finally seated. While thevwait did not get to us, the closeness of the seating did. 

Adventurous, we ordered Andrew Zimmern's recommendation of a mixed bbd plate with pig ears, cuttlefish and Chinese sausage. The cuddlefish and pig ears were not for the faint of heart.  The pig ears are very gelatinous and tough due to the cartiledge. The cuddlefish was flavorless. This wasn't a good meal for us. We returned the following day and enjoyed duck, chicken and pork, along with noodles, soup, etc. sticking to what we knew and enjoyed definitely made our experience much more pleasant and palatable. So why the four? Staff waits were long, items were forgotten but bill wasn't corrected. Too chaotic to be smooth."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the duck leg with friend rice. And the side order of beef tendon was so good. The portion sizes are large and I was eating beef tendon for three days."}
{"text":"This was the absolute best Chinese food I have ever had, and I'm from NYC. A little pricey but worth it. I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Don't know why this place was rated so well. I made the mistake of taking my grandparents here for a quick bite. It wasn't quick and wasn't worth eating. We just ordered wonton noodles. It took more than 20 minutes for the food to arrive, the food wasn't hot and the wontons were flavorless. And would it have killed them to put some some sprigs of bok choy or some veggie just so it looked nicer?  My grandfather didnt even eat it. Expensive for what you get too."}
{"text":"I was craving crispy pan fried noodles (Hong Kong Noodles) done right and they did them right at Kings Noodle Restaurant.  I ordered them with BBQ pork and BBQ duck.  If you want quality Chinese food with a ton of choices go here!"}
{"text":"Walked by and the BBQ roast duck and pig on display was saying \"eat me\". And we walked right in. This place was packed with different ethnics of people, and looks like everyone is happy.

Good selection of Cantonese food. Got a small BBQ Pork on Rice, the pork was so tasty and tender. Shrimp dumpling (Sui Kau) noodle soup broth was a little bland, but the shrimp dumpling was a hit. Minced beef congee (jook) was perfect! 

We got a table near the kitchen, and we were drooling seeing all the different dishes came out. Absolute if you want Cantonese food. And this is a cash only restaurant."}
{"text":"Family style.

Ordered 
Soy chicken 
Beef stew wonton noodle soup. This is enough for one person
Beef chow mein

Great food, quick service."}
{"text":"Decided to get take-away from King Noodle on an errand filled  Friday evening... The restaurant itself wasn't too busy, a few free seats and a short line at the bbq area.  I went into King Noodle once a few months ago, but came out empty handed cuz I didn't feel like hanging around when it was busy and the front area was cramped with people waiting to be seated and ordering the bbq.

The restaurant looks bright and clean when there isn't a crowd of people and service was fast... Very fast. I ordered my food and it was ready in 10 minutes.

I got:
- Beef brisket noodle soup
One of the best I've had - The beef was so soft and broth was flavourful, not too salty... Could use some veggies tho.
- 1/2lb bbq pork and small container of rice
Also very flavourful and juicy, good balance of sweet & savoury.

King Noodle food is top notch and prices were reasonable (total was under $13) - that's saying a lot as I have been spoiled coming from Markham/Scarborough. Will definitely be back to try the rest of menu.

Cash only."}
{"text":"Don't even know where to start, first and foremost the service is terrible (1/5) and food was not bad for it's price. Hence a 2/5 stars plus the food came pretty fast.

I am a chinese canadian who grew up eating at similar restaurants with a loud and fast-paced atmosphere. That being said, I am used to very blunt customer service but king's noodle took it to another level. It may the one specific worker but here's my experience:

1.) Waitress was especially impatient due to high volume of customers which is forgivable 
2.) She refused to listen out our order because we had questions about the price between an individual bowl vs big bowl leaving us with unclear prices (contradicting herself)
3.) When she had witness us asking a gentleman whom clearly look like he held a higher position she quickly came back to us after with a NEW attitude apologizing that she had giving us incorrect prices ($1 more for the big bowl and $.25 for individual bowls).... offered us complimentary soup as well.. I wonder why the sudden change of attitude.. hmm hmm 
4.) At the end when our bill came, she did not inform us tax AND TIP (more than 10%) is included. (totally unheard of in my 26 years of eating at chinatown). If we hadn't checked the bill, she probably would not have told us tip is included. 
5. and CASH ONLY for such a big/busy restaurant, they are totally unapologetic and rude about it. Plus we all know where that money is going.. 

Again, maybe it was just this one waitress but if someone can confirm that TIP being included is a normal practice there. 

We all know TIP being included isn't exactly a abnormal practice but restaurants do inform their customer BEFOREHAND for a party 8 or more usually.  In this case, we were not informed at all. 

Also I think this place is more of a $$ and not $. Most of their main dishes are $15-20 with the exceptions of congee and rice dishes which is slightly more expensive any other chinese restaurants in chinatown."}
{"text":"I will definitely return.  The bean curd rice roll was ahhhmazing!  My mother in law had some sort of soupy noodle dish with beef stomach that I had a taste of ... yummy!!!  The veggie rice roll was on the salty side - would not order again.  The BBQ pork rice roll was also quite delicious - I will order again.  Can't wait til the next time!

Prices are reasonable.  Food is fresh, tasty, and authentic.  Check it out :)"}
{"text":"Horrible service, we were seated and waited for over ten minutes to place our order. The restaurant was quite empty. I asked the server very nicely if someone can take our order she looked at me and kept walking. I figured they didn't need my money so I left. Will never go back."}
{"text":"This place was very clean for a Chinese restaurant. We ordered tons of food to try. The roast duck and char su pork were good.  A little fatty but delicious. The noodle soup lacked flavor.  But for the roast duck that came with the soup, the dish would have been tasteless. The shrimp in rice flour was good. The pineapple and pork fried rice was very good. Service, as usually in these  places, was not good. I would go back."}
{"text":"My friend recommended me this restaurant. I supposed this is small place, but actually cleaner, brighter and bigger than I expected. There are many kind of foods and they are really cheap!! I got a Wantan noodles. Wantan was so good. It looks like not so big meal but I was pretty full. 

????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????...??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Everything we tried here was fine.  We had the roasted pork (crispy skin and moist pork underneath), beef with bean sprouts and rice noodles was fine, and seafood with chinese broccoli was fine.  Although we had no major complaints, nothing was terribly exceptional or outstanding.  Serviceable place overall."}
{"text":"You can't miss it.... it's the only place with a window display full of crispy ducks!

The interior is very clean and modern (surprisingly clean from the exterior...)
Upon entrance to your left you'll see the butcher station and to your right there's a congee station and the display of FRESHLY made Chinese donuts (youtiao)! 


My family & I ate here 3 times on our trip!  

1st time- 
Hot & Sour Soup is too freakin' sour! 
Snow pea leaves w. garlic is overwhelmingly greasy...

2nd time-
Dim Sum was just OK. A bit on the dry side. 

3rd time- 
Congee (rice porridge) is absolutely delicious & perfectly cooked! 
Paired that with their freshly made Chinese donuts and preserved eggs. 
Definitely come here for their congee! 

...and if you like their Chinese donuts & dim sum. #149 is what you should order!"}
{"text":"Best Wonton soup in the city! Nearly always a line up, but they seat you fast. It's nice to see an establishment where the staff have worked there for years. The place was renovated a few years back, so no more of the broke tea pots that I used to always seem to get ( I think I miss them secretly) One of the few places where I've never had a bad dish, the taste is always spot on and the service fast inspire of its busyness, which i can only attribute to the efficiency of the staff."}
{"text":"Le King's Noodle une des institutions chinoises à Toronto, c'est pas cher, bruyant, ça geule, ça court dans tous les sens, le service est expéditif mais avant tout c'est super bon!

// the King's Noodle is one of the places to go in TO for chinese food. It's cheap, loud, manager yells orders to waiters, everyone runs around, service is super quick but damn their food is good!!!"}
{"text":"I've been going to King Noodle for 10 years!!! It's great to go with a group of friends , sometimes going with a plus one is a bit of a squeeze but it always works in the end.I always get the soya chicken on rice dish, it's my favourite cause it's so simple and super cheap too! I also get steamed Chinese broccoli and my mom tends to get her wonton soup with vegetables and duck. The food is always hot and fresh. Very fast service, you're in an out of there in a good amount of time as other hungry bellys are arriving. Sometimes we get roasted bbq pork to go and it's so delicious! They've upgraded a lot with their appearance from when they first started up! A little corny with the glass walls but very casual atmosphere. Great restaurant. I'm there every weekend."}
{"text":"The venerable staple of chinatown, King's Noodle has been spiffed up and instead of a dizzying array of round tables, white plastic table cloths, and hand scribbled wall poster specials, now sports a more modern layout with jazzed up colourful decorations along the wall and a TV with a custom video rolling through menu selections playing over and over. 
I dropped in to satisfy a craving for wonton soup and it hit the spot. The broth was hot and the noodles rounded out the soup nicely. The wontons were chock full of shrimp and pork and I could have slurped back a couple bowls of the stuff. The stone-faced staff seemed to be in a good mood and it sounded like a party going on in the kitchen behind me which I like to hear. There's nothing more satisfying in a restaurant than a perceived happiness happening with the staff. I dropped some change on the table hoping my server would pocket it, and threw more change into the obligatory huge pile of silver at the til where you pay. For under five bucks it was the ideal stop over when chugging down Spadina."}
{"text":"Typical China Town Experience. Food is decent. I've only order Soups, BBQ and Congee here which were all mediocre. Atmosphere is casual and busy."}
{"text":"I feel bad about giving this place one star but I have to!!' I ordered their congee with liver & intestines!! It was so disgusting!!! The liver had blood coming out of it and the funny thing is that other parts of it was over-cooked! So the chef didn't cook the dish evenly so it was partially over-cooked and partially raw. 

My friends ordered other stuff!!! Their beef in black bean sauce over rice was pretty good! Their other dishes were just OK...

Advice: order their dim dums! I think they're more known for their dim sums and other dishes on their small menu! 

On the plus side: their prices are cheap/ decent

I wouldn't come back again. I would rather eat anywhere else!!"}
{"text":"HISTORY/ABOUT: King's Noodle has been serving up insane Chinese/Cantonese style cuisine for years now in the heart of Toronto's Chinatown district. It truly is IMO the best Chinese cuisine you can get in the city, and hard to miss with the BBQ and bright orange cuttlefish hanging in the window. 

DÉCOR/AMBIENCE: KN went under renovation back in 2007-08 and they redesigned the restaurant. Although some may call the interior decor tacky, it is still on the higher end of venues in Toronto when compared to other restaurants serving similar if not the same cuisine. A highlight for me is the plates, they have grooves in them which allow the chopsticks to rest without rolling around and without lying on the table. The chopsticks are also customized with the print \"King's\" on them. 

MENU DESIGN/READABILITY: HUGE menu as you would expect of any Chinese restaurant. One page of appetizers, soups, congees, side dishes (including dim sum), noodles, rices, pork, fish, beef, chicken, desserts and more! I recommend Chef special section. 

FOOD QUALITY: Ridiculous. I highly recommend the Congee with duck and fried donut. Congee has perfect consistency, duck is tender and the chewy donut takes the texture train to a next level. 

The beef and Chinese broccoli is the best I have ever had. It's covered with bits of garlic and the beef is straight tender. Broccoli is perfectly blanched, mad green and super crunchy. 

I just drooled on my shirt. I'm actually having trouble writing this review. 

All I can say is..... Pineapple/BBQ Pork fried rice. 

BOOZE: Beer/Wine

PRICE POINT: slightly higher than average but well worth it. You will still walk out full for $15, but go with a group to save $ and try more dishes. 

SERVICE: The waitresses are hit or miss. Some don't even look at you or respond when you say thank you, others are very kind and smile. Bad service can often taint my meal however I have been eating Chinese food my whole life and am used to the occasional cold shoulder. At restaurants like KN service is not what they are known for or what they have built their rep on, it's bad ass Chinese cuisine.

BATHROOMS: standard, clean, downstairs. 

FINAL THOUGHTS: If you love Chinese food you must eat here. You can't go wrong with the menu because everything is executed and seasoned well. It is also one of the nicer looking Chinese restaurants you can go into wearing jogging pants if u had to. Do it."}
{"text":"A bit surprised things are so overpriced even though they only accept cash. Had roast duck and bbq platter for a whopping 16 bucks. You can get a three item platter from across the street at house of gourmet..... fortunately things tasted good so you won't be let down there."}
{"text":"Alright Andrew Zimmern, this place better be good!  Prior to arriving in Toronto, I had bookmarked King's Noodle Restaurant because I caught it on Bizarre Foods:  Delicious Destinations Toronto.  We found it, came here for an early dinner, easily seated at a table for two and just beat out the dinner-rush crowd.  

+ Dining + 
They had more than enough tables and chairs.  Large round family tables in the center, seating for four dining on the sides.  If there's anything I noticed, it was seeing someone wiping down tables or sweeping the floor.  That's always a plus!

++ Dishes we ordered ++
#47 Barbecued Duck & BBQ Pork wonton noodle soup ($12.95).  Oh man, this bowl had everything I ever wanted!  The wontons were plump and hardy.  The egg noodles were long and tasty.  The duck and pork were cooked just right.  All together in some savory broth and bok choy!  Such a refreshing bowl I deeply inhaled!  

#7 Ginger Chicken (half @ $21.95), well this was the biggest mystery, as I know for a fact after investigating every delicious piece, they pretty much served us duck.  This half chicken didn't have a huge breast, nor was the drumstick even fat.  It was all lean, dark, and boney.  But whether if it were duck or chicken, it was the ginger sauce/dip that made this dish!  Every bite had to be dipped.  The ginger was that good!  

#149 Rice Flour Roll with Donut ($3.95), how cheap!  We tried this just because.  I didn't mind the donut, but I wish it were shrimp.  Oh well.  It was still fun eating this.  

+++ Overall ++++
Now, I didn't exactly try their popular char siu dish they discussed on the show, but a sample of it in my soup was good enough.  Same with the duck.  The staff serving us was fine, no issue.  Only the busy emotionless cashier lady gave me attitude while paying.  Didn't know what I did.  This would've been a four star review, but she killed it.  Two turn offs, the 'cash only' factor.  Which is really lame as they're on a major street.  Second, again, it was that grumpy cashier lady.  The food here was simply delectable.  It made a lasting impression on how they do it in Chinatown Toronto!   Even with the mediocre service, I would still totally go back!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great food every time and always so cheap. We usually get the wonton noodle soup with bbq pork, shrimp dumplings and the donut. All amazing. This place gets packed at lunch so make sure to beat the rush!"}
{"text":"I would like to start off this review by noting that I made this Yelp account just so I could share how horrendous my experience at this restaurant was. 
Firstly, it took around 5 minutes for a waitress to finally show my friends and I to a table, several waitresses walked directly past us without even acknowledging us. 
We were then given one menu for the three of us to share, it took another 10 minutes for the waitress to come back and take our orders, when my friend began to ask about a portion size, she responded quickly in an extremely rude manner. 
My friend asked politely for a cup of water, our waitress walked away before he had even finished asking. We assumed she would return back, however after waiting about 10 minutes, there was still no water. My friend proceeded to ask a different waitress, she also refused to acknowledge him. After trying about five more attempts (no exaggeration, I have written five generously, it was probably closer to 10), a jug of water was flung onto our table. 
I took a bite of the chicken from the chicken with Chinese mushrooms and fried noodles i ordered. When I bit into it, It felt notably rubbery, as it went down I began to realize it did not taste right whatsoever.  I looked at the piece of chicken, it was pink. This chicken was raw. 
I showed my friends, they were shocked. I called over the waitress, at first she did not acknowledge me, In a bolder tone I said \"Excuse me, come here please\", for the first time on this visit, someone had actually acknowledged us. I proceeded to point to the piece of chicken and said \"this is raw\", she looked at and eventually responded \"raw?! it's chicken!\", I'm still not sure what exactly she was trying to convey, however I noted how rude and taken aback she was. I am an easy going guy, I give people the benefit of the doubt... However, I have always known that the customer is king, and I do believe in a certain amount of decency, regardless of it's at a restaurant or not. As I became increasingly defensive I said \"yes, this is chicken. raw chicken\" she continued to deny that the chicken was raw, eventually, she called over one of the chefs. I said \"this piece of chicken is raw\", after glancing at the piece, I watched as his face filled with fear, he began to shake his head repeating \"no, no, no\" in denial, and then walked away in a hurry. The waitress continued to argue with me, I told her that it was unacceptable for a restaurant to serve me raw chicken. \"pay and get out\" she told me, I stood up and told her there was no way I was paying for raw chicken, immediately she exclaimed \"you ate other parts of this! Pay!\" I stood up, i told her if she thought I was going to pay for raw chicken she was an idiot. In the end, I did not have to pay. By far, this is the worst service I have ever had in my life. It probably would have been even without the raw chicken incident. I am genuinely confused looking at the other reviews for this restaurant, as they are shockingly good. This makes me question why we were treated so poorly from the start. 
I truly would like to give Kings Noodle Restaurant 0/5 stars, unfortunately, that seems impossible on Yelp."}
{"text":"My family and I walked up and down Spadina having a hard time deciding which restaurant to settle down in being that we're foreigners. What's the surefire way? Peep inside and see how many people are eating!

At an odd time (3 PM), this was the only restaurant that was bustling. It proved to be a wise choice. We ordered a few dimsum dishes, salt water duck, fried crullers and vegetables to share. I had sam bo fan (roast pork, roast duck and chicken over rice), my parents had noodle soup dishes and my uncle and aunt had different rice dishes. 

Other than the roast pork I have no real complaints about the place. Not that it was bad, it just wasn't like how I'm accustomed to eating in NYC. 

Satisfied, we ordered congee and more fried crullers for the next morning."}
{"text":"They've definitely tried to make this place more welcoming by revamping the interior.  It's now bright and modern looking.  Heck, the washrooms are even pretty decent when before I was scared to go down the steps!  

The food is quite good for downtown standards.  The BBQ pork was very moist and flavourful.  I'd order that again any day.  Duck was pretty good too.  Stick with the BBQ options and the congee.  We liked the noodles but really, the wontons were the biggest let down.  

Pay at the cash register and leave your tip with the cashier.  She will put your tip in the communal tip container."}
{"text":"Really good bbq pork and bbq duck. Lots of options for noodle soups that are delicious. Service isn't fabulous but you take it for what it is."}
{"text":"I just called them asking for a take out order. I asked how much a whole barbecued duck costs. They couldn't really answer me. Then I asked how long it would take to pick up. She said just come and they will chop the duck in front of me! Not even answering my question! Haha and she hung up on me (--\") ya forget it. I'm going somewhere else it's fine for me."}
{"text":"I didn't like this place at all. 

I've had many people recommend this place to me. 

We came here for lunch on my bday and it was nasty. I got duck and it tasted disgusting. I usually love duck but idk what was wrong with it. It just tasted off. 

The service was absolutely terrible. I was not impressed. 

Bad experience all around"}
{"text":"I rarely go to Chinese restaurant in Downtown due to my fear of MSG (luckily I go to places in Scarborough/Markham that at least have less MSG or none) and the quality of the restaurant itself. But one restaurant, I somewhat trust is King's Noodles, having been here and Lai Wah Heen. 

Several months ago, I went here alone after prancing around and feeling hungry, I found this place again. The place to my surprise wasn't packed even though it was somewhat during dinner (other yelpers pointed out that it is often packed).

And like what other yelpers had been saying, if you are alone (or less than 8 people) then they will ask you to sit next to complete strangers but what annoys me is that place wasn't packed and I still have to sit next to strangers even though several tables are still open (and NOT reserved). 

Regardless of the annoying stranger that kept pestering me, I quickly ordered the Beef Brisket Noodle Soup so I leave right after I finish it. 

I liked the beef brisket, it was tender and soft and it really complimented the noodles and the broth was delicious as well. 

But after enjoying that meal, paying my bill at the counter and leaving to catch the streetcar, I had a sudden headache thanks to the MSG. 

And that's why I stay in the suburbs..."}
{"text":"Yeah that's two stars.  I had probably some of the most delicious Chinese food you can find in Toronto, left full, and even had leftovers for later.  The selection was great and it seemed very clean and busy. So why two stars then?  Oh right, the service.  Yeah I get it.  Chinatown is notorious for terrible service.  Does it have to be this way?  Does it really have to be like that?  I've never been to China so I can't really tell if it's a cultural thing, you know like the way it is over there, but in Toronto if you want a good review you treat your paying customers like people rather than dung-covered cockroaches.  Did they at least smile? Nope.  Did they respond with \"you're welcome\" after a thank you? Nope.  Did they mechanically walk away without even a glance? Yep.  One of the servers was even rude enough to tell one of the girls I was with \"you know you don't have to ask me things just because I'm walking by your table\" in Chinese.  I know this because it was translated.  It occurred after she asked for a takeaway container.  I wouldn't have tipped, but guess what: the tips are included in your bill.  Also, when you're paying up front in cash they are sure to let you know that \"tips go here\" and gesture to a change-pit in the counter.  Just in case you want to tip double for their \"great\" service.  I left here feeling a bit annoyed and ripped off.  I'm not sure if it was the prejudice from the staff or the double-tipping, but I probably wouldn't return here until it's been duly documented that their service is a bit warmer.  Maybe this review makes me sound like a big baby, and I'm ok with that as long as it gives you, the reader, an idea of what to expect going in."}
{"text":"Went for dinner because of the window display of Duck and Roast Pork.  
Food was average at best and EXPENSIVE and the portions were relatively small, we were taken aback when we got the bill.  Later we found that they had already added their 10% tip, we didn't mind because we typically give 15-20% here in the States
Our waitress was judgmental, rude and seemed to know what we wanted before we did.  We had to ask several times for plates, cups and utensils, no one wanted to help and tried to pass the buck to someone else.  

I eat in all Chinatowns and accept the rudeness, its part of the ambiance but they were just a little more rude."}
{"text":"Slowly becoming a regular here. Seating is a little tight / squishy if you are only a party of 1 to 4 as you won't get one of those big round tables, and you will easily hear your neighbors' conversations and/or them yours. Service and food have otherwise been excellent so far.  Food comes out fast and if you are lucky, you get free Chinese soup to start your meal and/or you get free Chinese dessert (tofu fa) at the end of your meal. Both were delicious and were a nice treat. We got free soup one time and we got free dessert one time. Not sure if it was because they had extras or if it depended on what we ordered. It will be our little mission to try to figure it out :)"}
{"text":"This place used to always have large portions of fresh Chinese food for a very reasonable price, how ever the last visit seemed like things have changed. For one the \"large\" soup was not that large at all, the crispy pork portion was tiny.
 The food was still good, the only thing was the donut ( I think that's what it's called, the crispy deep fried batter looking thing) wasn't as crispy and was more saggy. The other problem was the pea tips, they have it on the menu as \"seasonal price\" I should have really asked, but it being summer and all the fresh ontario veggies are in season I didn't see why It should be more then 7-8$. When the bill came it was 13.95$ I was shocked, it wasn't sooo little for so much? Wow what a shocker!"}
{"text":"Really good. We had the Chef's Special Fried Noodle, Wonton Noodle Soup, Spring Rolls and 1/2 bbq duck. 

King Noodle has the best BBQ duck in the city-- HANDS DOWN.

The only unfortunate part about the excursion here was that I think their food is loaded with more MSG than my body can handle. Most of my visits have been of the late night drinking variety, so if it affected me, I probably just passed out and didn't notice. And if i felt terrible the next day I likely chocked it up to a hangover. 

After our walk home, my eyes felt swollen and puffy as did my whole body. I felt as though I might not be able to keep the food down and a slight headache was looming. 

Great food (albiet the MSG) and good pricing. And that duck is A1!!"}
{"text":"One of the better Chinese restaurants in downtown Chinatown. Similar to House Of Gourmet and Golden Stone both just down the street.

They renovated not too long ago so it looks nicer than the other places and their name on all of the dining plates, bowls and chopsticks are a nice touch.

It gets busy and loud. If you're there at lunch, don't be surprised if you have to share tables with strangers (not unusual in china/hk) 

Food I would say is better and general hygiene is better than the other mentioned restaurants. Downfall is that they're closed on some days and their hours are not as flexible compared to the other two that open to the AM.

If you're looking for a place to eat in Chinatown, give this place a go. If you have a car, time and planning then go up town to Scarborough (the foods much better)."}
{"text":"Have loved this place since my childhood and not surprised that it is still open and busy regularly. Many dishes that sound bland and unsophisticated end up being surprisingly good. Late night or standard dinner hour this place won't disappoint!"}
{"text":"After walking along Chinatown in Toronto, I decided it was time for a mid-day snack / early dinner before boarding the train to Ottawa.  A bowl of hot noodles seems just like the right thing!

Atmosphere: 3/5  Simple restaurant with a bbq take out section up front and tables in the back; unfortunately there were already a few guests so I ended up having to share a table.  Overall adequate

Food: 3.5/5  I ordered the beef brisket w ho fun. The beef was a bit tough and there were only a few pieces - but enough for me (also see 'price'); otherwise it was tasty!  I also liked the fact that each person gets their own tiny pot of hot tea instead of the standard one glass of watered down tea

Price: 4.5/5  Great price for a bowl of noodles!  

Service: 2.5/5  Lacking; expected to order immediately and did not take credit card; also the server kept stealing our condiments which we needed to steal back; however also see 'price' 

Overall: 3.5/5  Overall a good place if you are only looking for a good satisfying quick meal, as service and atmosphere can be a bit lacking.  For me, it served my major purpose which was to grab something quick before another long trip."}
{"text":"The place is an institution in Chinatown. The BBQ meats are good as most other reviews have indicated. I can't say it's anything special for Cantonese style Chinese food, but it is a good option when you're looking for Chinese comfort food. Generous portions, brisk service."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I have to agree with a lot of reviews posted here. VERY POOR SERVICE! I went there with our family of 6. My mother in law who is fluent in Chinese in several different dialects, was treated very poorly. The won ton noodle soup came out with some won tons that were raw on the inside. The beef tendon was very rubbery. The \"siu-kau was also raw on the inside. The noodles in my wife's chow mein dish had a bitter taste to it. On top of all of this, we had ordered one order of dim sum on a separate paper (fried turnip cake) and it never came. When we asked our rude waitress where it was she denied we even ordered it! Terrible service. I think because we were so displeased with the service the waitress purposely added her tip on the bill! We will never go back and I urge all you yelpers to do the same."}
{"text":"Their noodles are legit. 

I had the wonton duck noodle in soup. 
the wontons were ok; mushy and not very tasty but the duck was done just right. The noodles were great; not overcooked and very authentic. the soup was tasty. 

I had the fried dough (youtiao). it was ok; huge for sure, but cold and not crispy, unfortunately. 

Prices were Very reasonable. The huge bowl of wonton duck noodle soup was only $8.99. absolutely worth it. 

Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"This was our fist time getting Chinese food from here and Sweet & Sour Chicken is my all-time favorite Chinese dish. It was simply ok from here. A tiny bit bland. BUT, the pork fried rice was AMAZING, so I met it the middle to give Kin's a 3. It was more a 3 and a half, but I couldn't give that. I would recommend eating here, but maybe trying something else besides the Sweet & Sour dishes. :)"}
{"text":"I got my brother to grab some takeout for me today.  I was looking forward to the noodles with beef tendon.

I could care less for the noodles as there was no flavour.  The beef tendon was ok as well, could have had more flavour as well but it was super soft.

I would probably go back but would try something else."}
{"text":"Stopped by because there was a large amount of Asians dining in the restaurant.  We started with conger and beef . The was a nice hint of fresh ginger and plenty of beef. It was also nice and hot. We ordered their beef stew in a clay pot . It was very tasty with the right amount of herbs . The meat was also very tender . Finally we had the crispy skin roast pork which was low fat and had crispy skin"}
{"text":"The food is only OK.
The service is absolutely TERRIBLE. The server their all look like they hate their job and are never patient when you have a question.
Yesterday when I went there, i asked for bbq goose because it was on the menu, then the server got really upset and annoyed and replied:\" I told you there is none.\" Well, news for you, you just started talking to me! and plus, if it is not in season, then don't put it on the menu, or put it on the menu and don't get upset when people trying to order it.
I came here often before, but finally couldnt take the terrible service anymore, that they act as if you owe them money, rather than you are a customer, so I no longer go there. Yesterday I was in a rush and another place close to them was not open so I gave it a shot. BIG MISTAKE.
terrible terrible. only go if you want bitchy faces looking at you when you eat."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place for over twenty years. My father would bring us and now I'm keeping the family tradition by bringing my nieces and such. This place is such a great eat on Spadina Road. It's cheap, fast service and clean. The food is very tasty. 

Their three meat combination on rice is what keeps me coming back. Along with their soups. 

Great Chinese quick food place."}
{"text":"One of the best roast duck in chinatown! All other food items are yummy. As authentic as you can get here in Toronto (other than Markham, etc.) Nice experience. Hard working employees. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place four stars based on authenticity alone.  With whole duck, pigeon and large chunks of pork hanging in the window, you know you're in for the real deal.  Their menu is huge, with everything from duck liver tripe noodle soup to pigs blood with vegetables over pan fried noodles.  It's worth a go just to try this place out.  They also have simple fare like chicken fried rice and the biggest spring rolls you've ever seen in your life.  
You guys should go. . .this place is packed with Chinesians. . .so you know it's good."}
{"text":"Meat-lovers, welcome home.  This place does great bbq'd pork, duck and others.  They also seem to sell a lot of donut-like bread that is eaten with congee, but neither of those appeal to me.  I'm big on noodle soups with bbq'd meats.  I like it with duck, pork and shrimp dumplings.  In most noodle soups, the broth is very clear, but at King's Noodles, the broth has a velvety texture that I quite like.  I've been here 6.2 billion times, and the quality has been equally high each time.  

New interior looks great, but the place is so festooned with customers, you hardly notice.  In addition to the diners, there's always a line up to grab a duck to go.  If you don't like crowds, you're in the wrong spot.   But if you are looking to grab a quick bite and you're not turned off hanging racks of various bbq'd animals, enjoy."}
{"text":"I've walked by this place dozens of times, and was eager to try it. Overall though, I was slightly disappointed. 

Food: Actually really flavourful. We ordered beef fried rice, the duck and pork meat dish, and Chinese broccoli. The rice was super tasty, and the broccoli were what you'd expect. As for the meat, the pork was good, and I really liked how the duck tasted, BUT it was really really fat and also annoyingly bony. There wasn't much meat left if you took off the skin and removed the bones.

Venue: Clean, relatively modern, and bustling. The washrooms were surprisingly nice. On the down side, the tables are VERY close together -- maybe just a couple of inches apart. By the end of the meal we had people on both sides of us, and it felt like we were all on top of each other and invading each others' space.

Service: Very fast -- Too fast I'd say. The food came within 5-10 minutes, and then the only interaction we had with a waitress was at the end of our meal when she dropped us the bill without saying a word. I just got the sense that they wanted you in and out ASAP. Basic courtesy, or a smile, wouldn't hurt.

I'm still hunting for a great Asian place on Spadina. I think I enjoyed Goldstone more..."}
{"text":"Dined here today and it was just okay.  Seafood congee was tasty as usual, my favourite, so a bit biased there.  Other family members ordered wonton noodle soup (nothing special) and beef flank and wonton noodle soup (alright).  We used to LOVE coming to King's Noodle, been patronizing it for at least a dozen years.  Over time, we've noticed that portion sizes are definitely less generous and prices have gone up.  Quality is not amazing but certainly does the trick.  Used to be a greater deal because of the value but when portion sizes are stingier over time while continuing to hit your pocketbook, the draw is lessened.  Unfortunately will be shifting gears and minimizing our visits here..."}
{"text":"There are two reasons I come here: the roast pork soup (which is a huge portion and I always struggle to finish) and salted donut which I have not had anywhere else.  What I also like is the circular communal tables which they sit you at when the place is busy, which add to the experience.  The staff really works to get you your order quickly.  Would recommend for the experience."}
{"text":"It's open again - just closed on Wednesday now. Excellent value for soups and Chinese-style bbq. Not a dining experience but a good meal."}
{"text":"Do not get the wonton noodles here! You've been warned. Several people in my circle including me have gotten what we call the dirty water noodles. This is where the noodles and broth taste like they've been sitting in some stagnant nasty rag water that's been used to wipe the counter a trillion times. Honestly just watch the meat butcher use that brownish grey towel to wipe his meat cleaver. Go spend your money else where you'll thank me later."}
{"text":"This place has been a landmark of Chinatown  for years.  I've always found the food to be consistent and service quick.  I come here for the BBQ meats.  BBQ pork, roast pork, BBQ duck and the congee are no fail items.  Most importantly if you can read the tiny plastic Chinese menu (usually on the table already) you'll find hidden specials that's not available in their regular menu.  You can't go wrong with the $3.95 BBQ pork on rice bowl. Although it's slightly smaller than the standard size, but still sufficiently filling for a lunch.   

Also expect to share tables with other hungry strangers if you come alone or with a small party."}
{"text":"As a CBC I love all types of food from Lebanese to Carribean to Indian and Greek.  But given a choice my go to meal is still Chinese.  

Came here after a visit to the AGO for lunch.  Ordered BBQ pork over noodles, BBQ duck over wonton noodle soup, and spring rolls.  It was all good!  BBQ duck was delish and wanton dumplings big meaty shrimpy pockets of goodness. Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Beef brisket here is really good. The ho fun noodles are soggy though. Next time I'd just stick with the regular noodles.

Sliced fish congee was yummy, and wonton and snow pea shoots pretty good. However, the fried dough wrapped with rice flour wasn't crispy enough. It was also served cold.

King's noodle is hit and miss depending on what you order. I'd get beef brisket again, and the fish congee for sure."}
{"text":"I agree with the recent reviews with regards to the low ratings. 

Food is not what it used to be. Congee is thick, like they added flour. Mister's beef tendon ho fan soup was bland, and the fried fritter wrapped in dough was soggy and damp. 

We had to go up to the front to ask for the bill since no one paid attention to us - long after our meal was done. 

I asked the manager if the chef was the same. He seemed a little embarrassed, so I guess the answer is quite obvious."}
{"text":"Fast service, great flavour and values. Highly recommend the Rice Noodled Rolls Stuffed with Deep Fried Dough (?? Zha Liang) and the Pork Blood Fish Fillet Congee! Soooo good."}
{"text":"Avoid this place at all cost!!!! The only reason I came here was because they open early. My family and I was here for breakfast. We ordered a few noodle soups and congee. My bbq duck noodle soup comes with vegetables and I saw it with my own eyes that my chef picked it up with her hands after scratching her head. DISGUSTING! The congees were cooked with baking soda and it left a weird soapy after taste. The waitress was RUDE and unprofessional. I work as front of the house and know exactly how to greet my customers. When we walked in she didn't even greet us and just asked how many? Really? No greetings? So please avoid this place because they aren't sanitary, rude, and foods that left a weird after taste."}
{"text":"The best authentic Chinese food I've had for a while.  We had the roast pork and seafood fried rice and pea pods with garlic and everything was very tasty!"}
{"text":"I ordered the BBQ Duck, BBQ Pork with Wontons and Noodle Soup. It was really delicious. The broth was flavourful, the wontons are awesome and the BBQ duck and pork were the best I've ever had. The only issues I had was that the meat had bones in it which made it awkward to eat and the noodles didn't taste that great."}
{"text":"Amazing dim sum, noodle soup with duck and bbq pork done perfectly, no \"pucker.\"  

Have passed by this place on Spadina a few doors north of Dundas more times than I can count.  I am so glad a pal o' mine reccomended it and we went today with a group of friends.  Food, service & price superb!"}
{"text":"We drove all the way from New York and ate here twice within 3 days.

They offer fantastic options for Chinese/cantonese breakfast.  Their rice rolls are super fresh.  Made to order, you can see the uncle making it upfront.  Best I've had!!!  I will be back again for it.

Their crispy pork is also good... Silky meat and crispy skin.  Perfect combo.  The duck and soy sauce chicken were also spectacular.  I was so tempted to bring some home.  Next time need to bring a cooler.

We have to wait both times for a table - and luckily we didn't have to share tables cause we were ordering like crazy.

Service is good and the decor inside is quite nice.  I wish we have something like this in NYC."}
{"text":"I have been here quite a few times, and unfortunately the last time I found a good sized maggot in my food! I walked out and will never return!"}
{"text":"King's Noodle is an institution in Toronto's Chinatown. You do not come here for good service. Nor would you come here for the atmosphere. You come here for good Chinese food at great prices. The portions are generous for the prices.  You should note that King's Noodle is cash only.

My go to meal at King's Noodle is the wonton noodle soup which will only set you back $4.15! Where can you get a meal for $4.15?  The other items on the menu are reasonably priced as well. If you are looking for some Chinese comfort food at reasonable prices, King's Noodle is the place to go."}
{"text":"Registed Yelp only because I want to say something about this restaurant. WARNING: Horrible service they cheat on the price when you want a take out. very small portion ( most of them were bone )when you opened it after you back home and the price they charge is higher than dine in. Obviously they treat take out customer different as I saw other people also complained about the same thing on Yelp."}
{"text":"This was a modern chinese restaurant and nicely decorated. Looked like a pretty clean place. Of course it was crowded and there was a long line to get seats for dinner. I ordered roast pork with noodle soup with the flat wide noodles (haw fun). It was pretty good spot in Toronto. I would go back here to eat."}
{"text":"I LOVE this restaurant and make a point of bring all my out of town friends here at least once! The food is always fresh and delicious, and they have a very good selection of vegetarian fare as well as plenty of amazing meat dishes for the non-vegetarians.  I have a gluten allergy so sometimes it can be difficult ordering a wheat-free meal if I am in the mood to try something new, but so far I haven't had any problems. This place is always overflowing with customers and for good reason!"}
{"text":"I must say nothing bad about King's Noodle Restaurant. Must never.
Simply because there isn't anything bad to say about this restaurant.

I've been coming here since I was young, before I lived in Toronto. I grew up with these tastes, preparations and expectations. My family comes here because it's good and the prices are very reasonable. The portions are massive, the BBQ is done exceptionally well and the wontons are plump and flavourful.

The restaurant is always bustling. I am always certain (as should you) that the food will be juicy, crispy and succulent. Speaking of succulent, the duck here is really good. It's a standard leg or thigh cut into manageable strips to make you look less barbaric when stuffing into your mouth. Often times, I do it anyways, its a finger food for me.

The roast pork is always also very good. Skin is super crispy and the pork itself is juicy and tender. With the dipping sauce, it's unbeatable. It always hits the spot.

I almost always get the Duck, BBQ pork (don't mistake this for roast pork), and wonton in noodle soup. It's the best of all worlds and only about 8 bucks. The bowl arrives steaming with the BBQ fragrances you want and crave for. The first bite is usually the best. A bit of this, a bit of that, with or without noodles with this bite. It's heaven for me.
The soup is flavour packed which makes the noodles even better, them already being great.

The Congee is very good here also. My mother orders that all the time, and I always help her polish it off (which is not very easy because the portions are large). 
The restaurant is now more modern. They have a long booth style bench hugging one wall and the wall decor has changed too. The utensils are branded King's and I'm confident in their cleanliness.

What I really like about King's is the environment. I feel part of the crowd amongst others that enjoy food as much as I do. I'm sitting here with my favourite dish and you're sitting beside me slurping on yours. Seeing kids eat the food I grew up eating is nice. I feel assured that the flavours I love will stay around for a while, even well after this bowl of noodle soup."}
{"text":"Food is alright.  I've been here since a wee little lad so I have to say that I enjoy their food but nothing really is special about it.  It's normal Chinese food in my opinion and that's how it should be.  If you want some good food,  come here. 

Service is bad as it is in many Chinese restaurants in Chinatown.  Their waitresses are worked to the bone and get scolded at by the aunties so definitely makes.  

I come here from time to time to get congee and their you tiew but that's about it."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went on a Friday because I was craving BBQ duck and chicken. If I were just giving a rate on the food it would be an easy 4/5, but with the service we received I give this place a 3/5.  I grew up in a Chinese family (half Korean, half Chinese) and I would say this place is pretty spot on. I ordered the BBQ duck and soy chicken rice on a plate, and my boyfriend had the BBQ pork and duck rice on a plate. Oh also, we ordered the BBQ rice flour rolls as an appetizer. The BBQ duck and pork was nicely cooked. The chicken was also very tasty. The plates came with a ginger scallion sauce on top which really made the meal. The BBQ rice flour roll was yummy, and reminded me of something I would eat at Dim Sum.

The decor is nothing spectacular as expected because it is a casual dining place. What's important is that the restaurant itself was clean. The staff are not very attentive and did not speak much English- as expected in many Chinese restaurants, but the later at cash was kind of rude. They also only take cash here as an FYI!"}
{"text":"Sans grand intérêt gustatif, j'adore les noodles d'habitude et elles n'étaient pas bonnes, le riz grillé, lui était très bon. Par contre le service etait lamentable, nous étions transparents !"}
{"text":"This place is a cesspool. Dirty, sticky disgusting. Had their special noodle soup, everything was crap... Duck was like rubber, pork was all fat, wontons were tasteless , and broth and noodles weren't good at all. Compound this with sticky gross environment.. I can't believe this place gets customers"}
{"text":"Although I've been to King's Noodle on multiple occasions, I have never tried their takeout service before. 

We ordered half a duck and Mapo Tofu (tofu stir fried in spicy sauce with ground beef). I was craving the tofu and had high hopes since King's Noodle never disappointed for any dish in the past. However, this dish was quite bland compared to expectations, with little pieces of pork instead of what was traditionally ground beef. 

The duck was very well cooked and flavourful, albeit a bit pricier than other places in Chinatown (as expected with King's Noodle).

The restaurant itself has a nice atmosphere where guests can see cooks at work, so I definitely recommend dining in if possible."}
{"text":"It disappoints me to give this place a 3 star due to service. The food is affordable and so good... Minus all the oil. The service was horrible and put everyone at my table in a bad mood. Every server who came to our table seemed distracted like we weren't as important as everything that was going around us. The server who took our order left in the middle of our order to get something/to do something and then came back... No one checked on us and we had to constantly flag someone down. 
As I was eating, one of the workers were mopping the floor. Right next to me. As I was eating. 1. You don't do that while people are in the dining room eating. It's rude. 2. People are going to coming in and the place will continue to be dirty. Why not wait until closing time? Not professional."}
{"text":"This is place always packed. Service is slow and wait for a table is so long. Place is loud and hot. Food is nothing special. All of them tasted ok. Price is reasonable. The bill came out more than what we calculated. Random 5 dollar here and there. Worse of all i got a stomachache after eating their food. I have to rush to the nearest washroom. Never coming back here. Stay away if you have a weak stomach."}
{"text":"Very solid. Yummy dumplings. Great noodles,, BBQ pork and dim sum (you need to ask for the ds menu). The veggies are all very fresh and place is as clean as it gets in the area. Service is efficient but not friendly. It is a strict cash only policy but there are lots of bank tellers around. In my opinion, the best of its kind on the Spadina strip."}
{"text":"I had the rice flour roll with shrimp as an appetizer and it was so tasty. The rice flour roll melted in my mouth, and that drizzle of light soy sauce gave it that hint of saltiness it needed. I had both the roast pork and BBQ pork, which were good. The roast pork has a nice crispy skin on it. I visited on Friday evening and the place was packed. I'll be visiting again next time I am in China Town."}
{"text":"I always get the duck to go, as well as some Deep Fried Dough. Warm it up when you get home, and it's delicious - always the same and it never disappoints."}
{"text":"Kings noodle is a mixed bag for. It comes with it's pros and cons (The pros really do outweigh the cons in here) but I feel that folks should be aware of what they're walking into:

Pros:
First and foremost this place is CHEAP and the food is REALLY good if you know what you're ordering. A bowl of noodles and meat with some diced onion can run you as low as 4.75 and an order of steamed pork buns maybe another 3.00 ontop of that. That's a GOOD bit of food for such a low price. It's perfect for hard up college students who are up late studying (It's open pretty late if I'm not mistaken) or just want a bite to eat with friends

Cons:
The service is very \"Rushed\" and can seem rude at times. They take your order, give you your order, give you your bill and you're out the door (Often times they just bring you your bill without you asking). They don't really talk to you that much, but they get the job done. The thing that bothers me though is the communal tables. If you come in with 1-3 people you risk being sat at one of the large, circular tables in the centre of the restaurant with up to 6 other strangers. This can lead to some awkward confrontations.

Other notes:
To elaborate on the food prices, it really is knowing what to buy. There is the entree menu further in with your roast duck, curries, etc that can certainly add up the bill, but if you stick to the noodle soups you'll always be walking out with a heavier wallet.

So yeah...Take what you will from this. Good food if you're looking for something cheap and quick, but don't expect pleasant conversation from the waitresses"}
{"text":"3 stars only because the wait staff seemed disinterested and even rude at times. However, the food was great. Noodle soups and spring rolls were just so-so but pan fried noodle with beef was excellent, as well as the stir fried noodles with pork and shrimp. Best dish was the spicy green beans with minced pork - amazingly good. Next best was the barbecued pork that had a delicious sweet glaze over it. We also liked their fried rice. Left full and happy and they give you big portions at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Really Fast service, sort of like a well oiled machine,  especially with take out.  
The seating in the restaurant, and the atmosphere is average, no ambience.  very much eat and go, definately not the kind of place that you want to sit and hang out at....but for hunger, it fills the need and hits the spot"}
{"text":"This is a pretty good place if you are looking for an above average cleanliness factor in Chinatown.  They have a great selection of soups, noodles, meats, dumplings.  It's like a 1 stop shop for all of your chinese food needs."}
{"text":"About the only restaurant in the city where you can walk in, sit down, eat a meal, pay the bill, and not have one server utter a word or smile at you for the entire time.

The food is actually better than average and decently priced. I'd go back more often if the staff would offer a hello once in a while."}
{"text":"Intersection of Dundas/Spadina for some noodles again looking for a SIGN from above.  King's Noodles, good enough for me and went inside and was surprised how it's not a dump that I knew Chinatown once was.  When did eating Noodles become so chic?  The crappy decor was always for a reason, to get your noodle, eat it, and get kicked out.  This place looked good enough to chill in a la Bubble Tea house setting up north.

BBQ Meats up front on the left as you walk in where you can hear the guy hacking into it.  Noodles/Congees to the right as you walk in the center towards the back where the dining area is.  White sleek walls with some kind of blown glass effect design patterns on the wall as decor.  The back is where the full kitchen is and can be seen as there is a sizable opening which I guess gives comfort to miscellaneous patrons.

BBQ Goose on Rice Vermicelli($8.95) came in a big bowl larger than the Noodles that varied from $4-$6.  Nothing bad to write about as it came with a large BBQ Goose Leg.  Some Bokchoy, big bowl of Broth and Noodle.  I paid Chinatown pricing but I was hungry and would have ordered more.  

The customers are of all demographics and backgrounds, also noticed what Neil T. said as the SOLO men sat communal style across from each other, having a romantic night of chowing madly into their large Rice dishes.

Menu items are largely Congee/Noodes/Rice/Snacks mostly relating to those BBQ meats.  The higher end Lobster Congee is seasonal pricing but I spared my friend who paid my meal.  I didn't even order additional Snacks or Vegetables.

As I left, I saw the BBQ Duck still hanging around but wondered where the Goose was.  Did I take the last Goose Leg?  It was only 9 pm or so."}
{"text":"the best place for HK style bbq and noodles.... also a great selection of one plate dishes... usually hit up the wonton soups with bbq but the tomato/beef on rice always hits the spot!"}
{"text":"A return visit to King's Noodle for the second time in only two weeks is possibly a good indicator of the quality of this establishment. Our first visit was during the day and it was busy with the lunch rush. This visit though was early Saturday dinner and again the place was packed.

We took up the standard position in the waiting area, which unfortunately is also the entry and exit foyer, the take away waiting location and smack bang between the BBQ service desk and the Chinese donut / soup desk. The constant dodging of wait-staff from the dining area to the counter and across to pick up orders for some could be overwhelming.

The food here looks good. The hanging BBQ pork and duck in the window are tempting during the wait for a table and they have a constant supply of Chinese donuts in production and ready for delivery to tables. A sample of what is to come once seated.

The tables are located close to one another, allowing a good review of others choices before making your own selection. As I was not feeling 100% that day, I went for my staple comfort dish of beef flank noodle soup.  At only $3.99 it's well priced and raises the question of why the addition of tripe in the \"Beef Flank and Tripe Noodle soup\" warrants a price-tag of over $7.00. A question to be answered next time.

The noodle soup comes out quickly and in a good sized bowl which is not overly voluminous that it makes you burst finishing the dish. The soup is clean and tasty, without the sometimes overly salty tint that some beef noodle soups impart. Both the noodles and meat are tender and revitalising.

This is a pretty simple dish and some would say that it is difficult to mess up, but it is also a dish with nothing to hide behind if things go wrong.

I'll definitely be back again, hopefully when I'm feeling better to select the other tasty morsels, or even just for some take away BBQ duck and roast pork as so many were opting to do. The word must be out."}
{"text":"The rice flour rolls?  Really?  If there's anything on this menu you shouldn't get, it is any of the rice flour rolls.  The soya sauce traditionally served with this dish is a touch sweet, but the one they serve here is salty salty salty.  This is a huge factor in my enjoyment of this dish.

Moving along...

I am a regular here and come often when I am by myself and want something quick.  I lean more towards the rice with BBQ'ed meats.  My girlfriend hates this place because the meat is always served cold -- yes, it is served pretty much at room temperature.  It is a little hit or miss too in terms of what part of the chicken/duck/pork you get, but you can request certain parts (i.e. breast).  Not sure if they charge extra.

Eune Y -- as for shrimp dumplings ('har gow') they shouldn't have pork in them.  Maybe you got 'shui mei' by accident.

This place gets 3.5 stars for me.  Despite what some might say, this place isn't 'cheap', it's about the same as other restaurants in the same genre in the same area.  Paying $7 for a plate of rice with meat isn't inexpensive (when you can get this in the burbs for $3.50-$4).  Oh yeah, be prepared to share a table if you are flying solo."}
{"text":"King's Noodle has happily become a default \"post AGO\" lunch spot for my friends and I.

Today we had (mostly) items from the dim sum card.  Previous to that we ate regular menu food.  Not to repeat the comments here but I find it all to be very tasty, authentic and a great value.  I'm still stuffed for about $17 all in.

Service was really good.  The interior is pretty nice too.

I would just note that part of the experience is a little bit of...I don't know...roughness?  This is a tricky one to explain but it comes from the fact that this is indeed a high volume, very busy restaurant.  Somebody mentioned \"well oiled machine\" and this is a very fitting description.  So, there is a lot of commotion.  It might be a cultural thing but I guess what I'm trying to describe is that there isn't a soft touch here.  Dirty dishes are slammed into their bins, food is quickly put down on your plate and the whole place might feel crowded too you.  This is the kind of spot where old guys stop in for a bowl of soup and chew with their mouth open.  Different culture, different standard and norms, right?  Again, this is all part of the experience--a sort of Chinese fast food joint with a huge menu to select from.  

If you are visiting, and there is only time for one Asian restaurant on your trip, this is an essential Toronto place to consider.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This is my favourite go-to place for my comfort chinese food.  I usually get the hot and sour soup and the pan fried noodles with beef.  Both dishes together can feed 2 or even 3 people.  :)  It's also quick if you just want to run in and order take out.
All in all, this is your typical chinese restaurant that has the ducks hanging in the front window and the soup dishes are also prepared at the front of the restaurant.  Prices are very reasonable for the amount of food and quality you get.  Service is quite fast and they will put the bill on your table even when you don't ask for it. lol.  I've been back several times.  
From time to time, you'll see the cooks carry a bucket of rice, broth or even sticks of pigs/ducks from the back kitchen to the front kitchen area.  
Try the hot sauce (chilis in oil) - it's quite tasty!
Note:  they do not accept debit of credit.  So make sure you have cash on hand or they send you next door to the ATM machine."}
{"text":"Our first restaurant upon arriving at Toronto at 10 pm. We were starving and so glad that this place closes at 2 am. 

The food was not bad either. We ordered quite a bit for 7 people. 
2 clay pot rices: these were a bit too wet. They added a bit too much water and the rice did not crust up on the edge like it was supposed to. It felt like sticky rice, but the flavor was there and very nice.

Ong Choy and Choy sum: garlic sauce like how all Asian people eat it. Not too soft and still crunchy.

Zhong zi- rice wrapped in bamboo leaf: not very good

Yin yang fried rice: this dish is always good. Being comfort food and all. Two different sauce one being white cream sauce with shrimp and a red ketchup tomato sauce with some fish cakes on top of fried rice. The sauces were kinda thick but still tasty

3 different congees: I tried the chicken one and it was very flavorful! We got a plate of fried bread sticks but they weren't crunchy

2 wonton soups which had a nice flavorful broth. And the wontons are made very fresh  when you bite it in half. You can see the shrimp

Complimentary beef stew was great. They make it like my grandma with all the different Asian nuts and seasoning"}
{"text":"I have been coming here since 1989 after checking out a few restaurants in downtown chinatown. The BBQ here is the BEST.especially the duck and roasted pork . As for cleanliness i had no issues . The cheaper items are still the rice and bbq and also noodles in soup and curry brisket and rice , and the massive steam dry noodles remains good  deals. The mains have gone up in price but if you can splurge , the deep fried squid with spicy salt ,is a standout. It is impossible to cook that dish and it is always consistent at Kings. The congee and hot pots , beef dishes all deserve a mention ."}
{"text":"what a rip off!!!!!!!!!!!!! not worth the money for the food. way over price.  never will I go back to this place again.  trust me people, find somewhere else."}
{"text":"Decent Cantonese restaurant in Chinatown. Quite typical in the area. Keep in mind it's cash only."}
{"text":"Cash only!! They will also take USD.

A few years ago, I was walking around Chinatown, trying to figure out a place to eat. I ended up at King's Noodle because of the amazing window display they had going on. Glistening barbecued pork, massive golden roast pork, stacks and stacks of long chinese doughnut, really I could go on and on. 

Four years later, I found myself still thinking about the amazing roast pork I had here and decided to come back. The roast pork is just as good as ever!! Perfectly crispy skin that gives you that crunch without the tough chewiness. Tender meat that's soft and moist. 

I also enjoy the congee here. It's nothing like the watery stuff I make at home. It's got that thick consistency that's almost gelatinous, but it goes down so smooth. 

This was one of those meals where there was absolutely no conversation because the food was just so damn good - we were too busy trying to inhale all the food. If you were sitting at the table next to mine, the only thing you'd hear is:
- *muffled* \"Omg\"
- \"So good\" 
- \"Do you want more hot sauce\"
- \"I want to order some to go too...\""}
{"text":"I've been fighting off the Cold From Hell recently, and the only thing that could fix it was some Asian penicillin -- that is to say, a piping-hot bowl of chicken congee. I went at around 6pm on a Monday and it wasn't too crowded; my dining companion and I were seated right away and at a little table of our own -- no communal eating per se, but the tables are pretty crowded together that it might as well have been. 

I can't say I enjoyed the tea too much -- it was gritty and kind of tasted like dirt. But, hey, it was worth what I paid for it (which was free), so I can't complain. 

The congee was delicious: gingery, soupy, and everything I needed. I also ordered a bowl of rice and BBQ duck to go for my dinner later, and that was good even reheated. The sauce wasn't too salty (a plus), but the skin wasn't very crispy (a minus). 

Service was very quick and efficient. I felt about a thousand times better, and the meal was very easy on my pocket. I'm definitely coming back!

Pro tip: CASH ONLY!"}
{"text":"I ordered the pork barbeque with rice dish while my friend ordered the pork barbeque with noodle soup. 

I think the pork barbeque used in both dishes is the same but I liked mine better because there was sauce. The rice was close to $9, the noodle soup was cheaper. I enjoyed the dish but the pork was not even warm. The rice was nice and hot though."}
{"text":"This place has always been the default restaurant for my friends and I whenever we go to Chinatown and can't decide on where to eat. The food has always been pretty good, especially the stir fried eggplant and fried rice. Portions are really big so you'll always leave feeling very full. The only complaints that I have about King's Noodle is that the prices seemed to have gone up recently, and that (like most places in Chinatown) it is a cash-only place."}
{"text":"I got wonton soup with BBQ chicken, congee, fried dough stick, rice paper roll wrapped in fried dough, beef tendon, and milk tea.

I LOVE their rice paper roll wrapped in fried dough; perfect crispiness of the dough is paired with soft (not soggy) rice paper roll. 

Beef tendon is tender and the broth is very beefy.

Definitely returning! This place and House of Gourmet are my favourites for comfort Chinese food."}
{"text":"We came here starting late at night and loved our food. For $18 all inclusive, we got a Egg/beef stir fry over rice noodles (ho fun) and a BBQ duck wonton noodle soup. The noodles in the soup were bouncy and chewy, but the duck pieces in the soup were not the best quality (there was a lot of fat and skin on the duck and the meat was overly salted). The start of the night was definitely the big place of ho fun that my boyfriend gulped down in less than five minutes, the ho fun was stir fried before hand, giving it a lot of the smoky wok flavour typical of HK cuisine and it was topped with stir fried beef and vegetable is a slippery egg sauce. The almost sloppy texture of the noodles and the extremely strong flavour of the ho fun was definitely the highlight of the meal. The Ho fun were a bit too oily, but having only eaten a small bowl of it, i found it to be extremely yummy."}
{"text":"Great food. Perfectly greasy, lots of flavour, just spicy enough. There are about a dozen different types of dumplings, and you should try as many of them as possible. The duck soup is also great, and my personal favourite dish was the spicy hot pot King's Noodle is great for big groups of people so that you can try as many of the dishes as possible. The atmosphere is loud and busy, perfect for a Chinese restaurant and the wine is generously poured."}
{"text":"House special spicy fried noodle with pork and shrimp - must try!!! Great dim sum and soup great too, but literally the noodles are something I dream for all year and I bring them back with me on the plane. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I went to this place today after all the talk about how it's the best BBQ place in Chinatown. I spent $4.50 for a bowl of noodle soup + soya sauce chicken. After tax and tip it came up to $6ish. 

The service was horrid. I went in and asked to me seated and she literally scolded me in Chinese and made another lady bring me to a table. It took me about 10 minutes to order. The servers were acknowledging me with a head nod and walked away. Granted, it was busy so I let it go. 

My food came with no vegetables. I go to goldstone all the time and they include bok choy, even in the photos, people usually get vegetables. There was so little meat. I literally had to scrap the skin and a tiny bit of meat off the bone. The noodles also tasted like fish??? The soup was so oily I couldn't even finish it. 

When I asked to pay, they told me to walk up to the cash. I went up to cash and asked to pay and the cashier got upset with me bc she didn't know what I ordered ...so I tried to tell her and a server threw a sheet of paper at her and she rudely told me the total. I still tipped 20% even though I had basically no service whatsoever and a terrible meal and she still scoffed. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Only if I didn't see them microwaving the soup in a styrofoam container where they prepare food for take-outs (near the entrance).....this just tells a lot about how careless the staff is. Although bbq duck noodles I got was OK, I will not return here. There are plenty of Chinese restaurants like literally everywhere in GTA that serve equal or better quality of soup noodles. Decor is pretty modern and clean compared to other Chinese restaurants near the area at this price range."}
{"text":"Great food for the price.  Their deep fried chicken wings are little known but amazing."}
{"text":"I ordered \"Three Types of Roast Meat combo\" with rice.

The portion was massive - could probably feed two moderately hungry people.

(1) Roast duck - too much blubber, could not get more substantial meat from it.
(2) BBQ pork belly - I did not think the skin was crispy enough. The pork was too bland and stiff. They could have cut it into smaller cubes.
(3) Char siew - not flavoured enough.

The gravy which came with the dish was the only redeeming factor ... Probably one of the worst cantonese roast meat dish I ever had."}
{"text":"Came for breakfast on a Sunday morning. The restaurant wasn't crowded which was a good thing. 

We ordered:

Roasted pork: good, skin was delicious and crunchy but a little bit on the salty side 

Roasted duck and char siu with egg noodles: duck was super salty and chewy. Char siu and noodle soup was bland 

Preserved eggs with pork congee: good. Not too watery

Chinese donut: would have been better if it was a little toasted

We asked for extra onions and the waitress said she already put a lot in the noodles and didn't seem to want to bring us more but she did. We asked for boxes to pack up our food and they asked for what. The waitress even left the cashier to come to our table and ask what we are packing up. I said the Chinese donut and pork, they said use the brown bag for the donut and give her back the box. Who says that? I don't want to put it in the bag. Does it matter how I pack my food? I told her I didn't want to put it in the bag I'm traveling far. She was pretty upset and mumbled in Cantonese how it should be in the bag and if we weren't going to use the bag she wanted it back. I replied in Cantonese and told her you want the bag then take it back, but of course she didn't. She was super rude. Food is whatever I would say pass on this place and spend your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"When you walk in and you see ducks on one side and fried congee donuts on the other, you know this place is legit.  We ordered the roasted pork (crispy!), roasted duck congee and some cow tongue donut.  I think I should have had the regular congee donuts.  The cow tongue was a bit heavy and didn't soak up the congee as much.  The place was packed and the table next to us ordered 10 dishes for 2 people.  I was so hungry!  We will order more next time.

The roasted pork was sooo good!  5 stars for food and atmosphere since I love busy restaurants."}
{"text":"THAT BARBECUED PORK. GET IT.

Also, service was decent, prices were amazing.
Not much to complain here."}
{"text":"My usual go-to-place to buy BBQ / roasted pork take out when I'm downtown.

This place is always packed whenever I go. The service is always quick. The serving size comes in huge portions, which usually ends up as take-out.  Might I add, this place is clean. 

I would recommend trying the wrapped rice noodles. The texture of the noodles is smooth and silky. Flavourful with the shrimp or scallop.

Price is reasonable. You won't walk away feeling hungry."}
{"text":"oh kings noodle. a bit biased since i've been coming here since i was a kid, but this place is full of memories, even if they've renovated the place. 

the mein is never overdone, always al dente and excellent. the wontons, are pretty average in size and taste. the juk is never burnt and the youtiao/yau ja gwai is best eaten early in the morning when they're still fresh, crispy and warm. their bbq pork is done right and not too fatty. 

this is an excellent place to grab a quick cheap bite of some decent cantonese/hk style comfort food."}
{"text":"We had noodle soup, fried rice, spicy noodles   Everything was great. For sure we will come back!"}
{"text":"When I'm downtown and I'm craving really good deep fried squid, I make my way to King's Noodle. Their offerings are balanced as they have a BBQ table, noodle counter in addition to the kitchen. But I find their very extensive menu can get confusing with redundant items. 

I often stick to the tried and true - squid, fried rice, steamed fish, rice noodles, roast pork et al. I haven't been disappointed with that. 

The one thing that's hit and miss is the service. Sometimes extremely efficient and quick, other times slow and careless and never warm. It's always business which makes me wonder - could it kill them to smile?"}
{"text":"It amazes me that there aren't enough congee places in Chinatown. Went here, picked up two bowls of Shrimp Dumpling Noodle Soup, the Fisherman's catch congee and a dough fritter, total damage, $17. CHEAP!

The shrimp dumplings were of good portion but I prefer the noodles to be slightly more al dente. Might of been cause I did takeout, don't know.

The congee though, was quite surprised how good it was. Lots of seafood includes. A good one.

Dough Fritter, of course made the paper bag all greasy and such. Means it's done well!

But I've also had the wontons here before, I wasn't as impressed with it.
Seems everyone likes this bbq ducks, I gotta go back and try."}
{"text":"DON'T COME HERE IF YOU'RE NOT WHITE.

As much as I'd like to say the food is good. Service is the most terrible by the servers - if you're not white. The way my friend and I got treated was incredibly disrespectful. As soon as we walked in, no one says hi. The server just pointed to a seat and threw down the menu on the table. When we got seated, no one paid attention to us. As soon as a white couple walked in, they're greeted with an enthusiastic \"hi!\" or \"hello!\" and a smile ... from all the servers.

After we ordered out food, the server just put a stack of bowls in front of us - expecting us to separate the two bowls ourselves. There was a racialized couple sitting beside us, and as soon as they left, the servers pushed the empty table closer to us - and seats another racialized couple down. We were practically sitting like a four seater! Which is extremely uncomfortable and disrespectful. Why didn't the server push the table closer towards the white couple that came in?

The comparison of the way the staff here treats white folks versus racialized folks (even if you're chinese/east asian) is condescending. You can see the favouritism in serving white folks. It doesn't really matter if you lose me as a customer, because you have white folks supporting your service anyway.

P.s. don't even get me started on the portion size of the food we got, compared to white people. $12.95 for 8 strips of roasted pork? I can probably get a quarter of a pig if i went to scarborough."}
{"text":"I used to go here over the years with my family from when it used to be a dive, through the renovations and then now with the fancy odd shaped bowls. It's funny how the waitresses look the same from when I was younger. They're the constant fixture of the place through all the years.

I've always liked the food at King's Noodle but last night I was just disappointed. I hate to give them 3-stars.

After a semi-late night in Kensington Market I decided to take a route through Chinatown on my walk to Union Station. I already had a simple dinner but the soft glow from the King's sign beckoned me in like a siren to passing seaman (hehe... seaman).

Anyway, I ordered the sui-kau noodle in soup and a side order of rice flour roll with donut. Something quick and simple since I had a train to catch. Anyway, the food looked delicious. Unfortunately, it wasn't.

The sui-kau dumplings were horrible. They were either overcooked or were recooked because they tasted bland and just dissolved in my mouth. Dissolved like a Crispy Creme donut... yeah, you know what I'm talking about it.

There was no give from the shrimp and pork mixture. It just turned to mush. There was no hint of sesame oil, ginger or green onion. No flavour at all. I don't know if things changed or if my nostalgia blinded me but this was definitely not the same as the same dish I've had over the years. The dumpling wrapper just fell apart when I picked them up with my chopsticks and turned to mush along with the filling when I ate them. It made the whole experience horrible. The only good things were the soup which wasn't overly salty and the noodles were nicely cooked. They still have a little texture as i shovelled them into my maw.

The roll with donut was good. The sauce wasn't overly salty and complimented the roll and donut nicely when you tipped it on its side and dipped. Not a lot of sauce to bog down the crispiness of the fried donut which was good.

I'd give them a 2.5 but there is no half points and nostalgia can't give them a 2.

Maybe next time I'll try the siu-kau again or maybe I should stick with the window meat over steaming rice or the other cooked dishes (ie. three kinds of seafood with black bean sauce on rice). It was a sad moment and made my childhood me cry... but only a little bit."}
{"text":"If you are a fan of rushed service and decent food, this might be for you. It's busy, it's an interesting Toronto experience.. Won ton is not very good. Ask for bbq pork LEAN, or its gross.. Chicken fried rice is good. It's overpriced."}
{"text":"I heard about this restaurant when watching Andrew Zimmern visit King's Noodle during his trip to Toronto. The duck and the noodle soups looked so good. 

I came for lunch and ordered #47, Barbecued Duck, Barbecued Pork and Wonton Noodle in Soup. The duck, pork and wontons were all delicious, and the soup itself was tasty and not too oily. I particularly loved the wontons which were very flavorful and were loaded with meat and big pieces of shrimp. The portions here are huge and I wish I shared my soup instead of ordering a whole bowl to myself. I couldn't finish the noodles or broth so I made the effort to at least eat the meat and wontons.

There are a lot of items on the menu so be sure to read through it thoroughly. The restaurant is clean and there are tables for small and large groups. Service was courteous but a bit scrambled during my visit."}
{"text":"4/5, must try if you like Chinese food! Prices are quite cheap and food is great. However, service isnt the greatest and nothing special about the aesthetics of the restaurant.

King's Noodles is a fairly famous spot in Chinatown known for their Wonton Noodles and deep fried bread sticks. I grew up in Singapore and I feel like I have a fairly good taste of what good Chinese food tastes like. I ended up ordering the Hot & Sour soup, Wonton Noodles, Dried noodles with duck and pork, fried donut rice roll and black bean pork ribs rice. Overall, food was really great! I was impressed by how good it was, given the cheap price point. The meat (bbq pork, duck, etc) was all excellent and the broth of the soup was really amazing. The food is quite authentic and enjoyed everything I ordered. The portions are also quite large. The only drawback is that the service isnt the greatest but I typically expect that at Chinatown restaurants; you have to work to flag down the waiters/waitresses and they arent always the friendliest."}
{"text":"Food and service were very good. Place was packed on a Sunday afternoon. We had siu gow mein and shredded pork and bean sprout fried noodles (#245). cooked perfectly. Portions were hardy. Most of the customers were Chinese which speaks volumes. 

We will definitely come again. We felt like home in San Francisco!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Would have been much better if I had a few drinks, however being around 3:00 it wouldn't have been a good idea.

Congee tastes great, barbecue duck is great (just a little too much bones), beef rib and tendon was pretty good. 
And they surprised us with a free bowl of black bean congee for dessert.

We ordered a couple of other things, not worth mentioning, but with the bill coming to a total of around $40, and with us leaving with a take container, and fully stuffed, it was definitely a bargain."}
{"text":"You'll quickly identify this place by the hanging food in the window just north of Dundas; it's what first caught my eye a couple years back and I had to step inside.

Once you're inside, I strongly recommend sitting near the back of the restaurant as every time the door opens there is a very chilly draft off the street this time of year.

The food is quite tasty.  I enjoy any of the soups with duck, as well as the dim sum.  They have many options for everyone to find delicious things to eat.

One thing you'll probably find is that the service isn't as good as it could be.  Sometimes it takes time to place an order.  That being said, once your order is in, it doesn't take very long before it's on your table and still steaming hot.

A word of advice:  be careful not to have your feet in the aisle or they may accidentally run over your foot with one of the dish carts!  This happened to me the only time I went there in sandals.  Not only did they not offer to comp anything, but they barely even stopped their cart when I yelled-out a painful \"YEOUCH!\""}
{"text":"Food was average for a china town restaurant, but the service is terrible. They're extremely rude to you, really ruined the experience. There are much better restaurants in this area with much better service."}
{"text":"I don't have a problem with this place - food is always delicious but the price went up recently and the portion sizes have shrunk. Upon checking out,just count your change."}
{"text":"Warning: the food quality has dropped.

I eat here a lot and this time I really didn't like my usual dishes, my friend also agreed that it was too salty. I felt the duck was gross. The dim sum quality is also lower, but still pretty good.

I'm going to be skipping this place for a while.

Staff: Kind of moody, but I don't think that's on purpose. I don't like it, however."}
{"text":"Always been my favorite place for no nonsense noodles.  Roasted duck wonton noodle
Soup is the best.  Too bad it has become a place for tourists."}
{"text":"Not what you pay for!!!

This was a huge disappointment. With the current star rating I only went there because the rest of the family wanted to go there.

Hubby ordered the roast pork. The roast pork picture showed veggies but came without veggies. It was very fatty - and not in a good way, it felt like you were drinking oil. 

I ordered roast duck. Again, nothing but fat. I decided the scrape off the actual meat and felt like there *may* have been up to 1 oz of actual duck meat. Total rip off. 

The wines on the menu pictures were Beringer and other brand names but the actual wine came out of a huge box. Which would be ok in an of itself, it's the fact that they were misrepresented. At the end, the wine was probably the best item we had. 

Rest of the family said their food was ok.

They also take cash only.

With so many great Asian restaurants in Toronto, there really isn't a reason to ever go here."}
{"text":"O!

\"you tiao\" = 
Chinese cruller
a.k.a.
Chinese Donut
a.k.a.
Oil Strip

I know, it does not sound appetizing, but I guarantee - it's delicious!"}
{"text":"I gave it 3 stars because the food was just ok. Nothing blew us away as being very good. We had the steamed bbq pork buns, which was the best thing we had. We also tried the bbq duck and chicken over rice, the beef with fried noodles, the Schezuan prawns, and a beef noodl soup. All were good enough after adding soy sauce and hot sauce, but none were great. I will not come back. I would prefer to try different restaurants."}
{"text":"Food is okay, service is terrible. Ive been here multiple times before and just went again last night. I have never received such terrible service anywhere before. An older woman served our table and was immediately angry at me when I asked her for three BBQ pork buns. I asked how many come in an order, and she didn't tell me. She told me to write it down, and when I saw the menu ordering sheet she gave me, it said 3 BBQ pork buns per order. Then I wrote down 1. She got upset because she already put the order for 3 BBQ pork buns into the kitchen (which defeats the purpose of giving me a menu to write down my order). 

Then towards the end of the meal, I asked for my soup to be put in a container. She got upset, telling me she \"doesn't like to do this\" and that I shouldn't have asked her to pack up my soup to take home. She then proceeded to pour half of the soup in the container, splashing the other half of the soup that I PAYED FOR on the table and pouring it on the floor. There were wontons and noodles all over my table, and she continued to yell at me. My jaw was on the floor (along with the Niagara falls of soup on the floor and my shoes). When we went to pay, they actually had the AUDACITY to demand a tip!!! Absolutely not. If you're in the food service business, and complain about a simple task, you shouldn't be working the job you are now. Terrible!!! I am absolutely shocked at the service I received. I usually love coming here, but will never come here again."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Sunday night.  Ordered number 33: Noodles (rice noodles) in soup with braised beef sinew.  It was pretty good and the price was decent.  Ate here before and will repeat.  One of the most popular restaurants in Chinatown.  Always crowed.  One of those go to places."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 4 stars because their wonton noodles and char-siu are really good. The service is quick and efficient, don't expect friendly service, it is Chinatown after all. It's a great resto for a quick bite of good, solid Chinese/Cantonese food. When I visit my sister and I'm not sure what to have for lunch or dinner, this is definitely our go-to spot for affordable, quick Chinese food."}
{"text":"Has been a very long time since I came here to eat again.
The place is still the same. Even the lousy service.
Other than that. I came with 6 other people. We ordered quite a bit of food.
Rice, roasted pork, bbq duck, char siu, leave greens and 3 bbq duck noodle soups.

I really missed the char siu from this place. Before my mom would come into this place to buy char siu every time we went to Chinatown, now she buys char siu at the local Chinese supermarket..tastes different. 

The BBQ duck noodle soup was nicely porportioned. The delicious part of it was the nice crispy skin on top. As you bite down, you can hear the cracking sound. The noodles were a bit  too oily for my liking but whatever. 

I really recommend this place but beware of the lunch and dinner periods, it can get pretty crowded, you might get seated with a group of people (complete strangers) too if there's not enough tables (if you go alone or if you go with a small group of less than 8). Overall, the BEST noodle and Chinese BBQ restaurant ever!"}
{"text":"One of the better restaurants in China town. Incredibly cheap for what you get! Basic noodle soup or rice bowl with bbq pork or duck are around 5 bucks. I frequently get noodle soup with bbq pork and wanton, which is only around $8.

Other than noodle soup, they are known for their bbq pork or duck dishes. I especially love how their pork is golden crispy outside, but soft and tender inside. Most of their other dishes are good as well. 

Only major complaint I have with them are their service. They only take cash and the service is pretty slow. Most servers are okay, but there are few who are rude. 

However, in spite of their below average service, I would still recommend this place if you want cheap Chinese food."}
{"text":"Kings's Noodle House is great!   Look, for those of you dimwits who call this place \"Noisy, rude, and rushed\"...do yourself a favor and stick to Red Lobster and Olive Garden and never, ever visit China, Vietnam or Hong Kong.

The service is rushed, but who cares?   I want my noodles!   They aren't terribly personal, so what?  I want my noodles!  Who wants to chit chat?  I want my noodles!   And seriously...they are Chinese immigrants...what are you going to talk to them about?  If you want to chat with your waiter go back to TGIF.   They are rude?  No way.  They put duck on my soup instead of pork...they fixed it promptly.  Was she insistent that I ordered it with duck?  Sure!  JUST LIKE IN CHINA!  It was great!

The Hong Kong style noodles here were nearly perfect.  The duck is roasted on site, the broth was perfectly seasoned, the bbq pork was generous in portions and flavor.  The Spring rolls were great.

I love this place and you people in Toronto are LUCKY to have it.  EAT THERE"}
{"text":"King's Noodle fits that comfortable place between small, possibly big risk-big reward Chinese joint and upscale dim sum-a-palooza.

The restaurant is clean and well-lit. Food comes out quickly, and the menu features about 1,000 options, so even the most begrudging Chinese restaurant goers can find something to eat here.

My experience was satisfying-tasty, yet familiar Chinese dishes. The portions were rather large as well.

The possible drawbacks are....


- a fixed menu where there are no \"new\" dishes or options. What you see (in the picture menu) is what you get.

- it is cash only. Not even debit. Seeing that a party of four could spend anywhere from 50-100 or more here, this is kind of annoying."}
{"text":"Went in for a breakfast of congee. The congee was flavorful and the duck was delightful. It was pretty quiet but still a good number of people in the place considering it was about 9 am on a weekday morning."}
{"text":"How come shrimp dumplings have pork and beef in 'em and the wontons just have shrimp.  Hello I am confuse okay? Or have I got that wrong again?....Anyway, despite the fact that I still seem to order the wrong dumpling everytime I come to King's Noodle I still have a tasty meal and leave in a good mood.  I love that it's bustling and that the service is super fast like lightening.   The noodle soups are very filling  and a bit on the heavy side so I like to eat 'em with a side of steamed Chinese broccoli.  It's so cheap I want to order more but I just don't have space in the stomach which is a shame 'cause it all looks great especially the bbq meats which I miss terribly."}
{"text":"So- the service is horrible, get over it. But, that roasted crackling pork is sooooo good.

I got the roasted pork/duck rice plate. It is super moist and the skin is perfect. The dim sum is not bad either (try the Hau Gaw).

I noticed all the other Asians got the Wonton Noodle soup, and it looked amazing. I would do that next time.

This places opens until midnight on the weekends for a late night snack too!"}
{"text":"Best bbq duck and soy chicken place in Chinatown. Wonton not so good."}
{"text":"I am not sure how this place received so many great ratings and a 1-$. We spent $123 on breakfast! Admittedly, we ordered a little more than the avg people, but the prices were outrageous. $18.95 for 1/2 roast duck. I'm from NYC and I'm used to seeing high prices but this place makes NYC Chinese restaurants look like a bargain. Someone in our group ordered a san Bo fan (three roasted items on rice) and it was $14.95. Same dish in NYC would be $5-$6. So these are just some comparisons for you. 

The worst part about this place isn't even the ridiculous prices. It's the fact that the food isn't good. We ordered a variety of noodle soups and congee and dimsum dishes. The noodle soup base was tasteless as were the dimsum dishes. It was incredibly disappointing. They forgot two of our dimsum dishes and it was towards the end of our meal so I requested they cancel it since they forgot it. 2 minutes later, she came out with those dishes refusing to let us cancel. We were already done with our meal by then. 
They also automatically tack on 10% gratuity which isn't so bad but with their horrible service, I would have left $2 instead of the $12. 

I am never ever going back to this place and everyone in my group agreed. Overpriced. Under tasted tourist trap. Save your money for all of the other places to eat around here."}
{"text":"This restaurant is constantly busy with customer lining up to get a table. They are known for their great noodle bowls and also their in house BBQ meats. 

Most of their soup noodle bowls are less than $10 each, which is really value for people looking for a fast, cheap meal, which explains the huge lineup everyday. I ordered the BBQ duck with flat rice noodle and got served within 10mins. The BBQ duck as ok, but I would have liked it more if it had more flavour or sauce on it. The noodle was soft and smooth and it didn't break easily. The soup was pretty good as well, didn't taste like it had a lot of MSG which was good. Would come again if I'm in the area looking for a cheap eat.

The waiters were pretty impatient, typical of many restaurants in the Chinatown area. However, the cashier was straight up rude when you try to ask her something. Since this place is cash only and I was given exact change when I paid for the meal, I just kept all the change because their attitude was pretty awful."}
{"text":"This is my social club in Toronto Chinatown. Its a great place to relax, drink as much tea as you like on the house, and enjoy their Hong Kong style delicacies. Sometime members of certain organized groups get in loud arguments, but just mind your own business and chalk it up to \"ambiance\" I used to come here with my friend Shrimp Boy in the 90's."}
{"text":"Overpriced and really bad service. Food was mediocre. If you are a tourist in search of good Chinese food, I would  avoid chinatown and eat in markham where the food was much better quality for a little less."}
{"text":"This place is packed with line up at the front. But seriously, I'm not quite sure why though. Service is horrible. The server won't look or even respond to you. When we paid for the bill, it took them forever to give us back our change. I guess they were hoping that we will get impatient and leave it all as a tip. Food was just ok, nothing in particular stood out for me. My husband did come back another time and said their congee and shrimp roll were good. So maybe I'll give it another try someday. But for now, just 3 stars, and that's is being generous."}

{"text":"Listen, you shouldn't be in Chinatown if you're looking for high-quality, super authentic-like-home Chinese food. It doesn't exist here anymore (ironically). That's all moved up to Scarborough, Markham, and Richmond Hill.

What you have left in Chinatown are just those old-timers that refuse to pack their bags. The food served at King's Noodle is mostly the same as what was served in the 80s and early 90s -- there has been practically no change. It's still the same simple, staple food that represents an era of transition from the time of the early Chinese immigrants, when you had the first Chinese restaurants firing up North Americanized spins on their hometown dishes using whatever local ingredients were available, to the time of mass immigration starting from Hong Kong in the mid-90s. This latter era saw a large influx of more wealthy, entrepreneurial immigrants -- a stark contrast to their predecessors. And with them came more highly skilled chefs and artisans, settling down north of the 401 with their talents, where now you will find some of the best Chinese food in all of North America.

So with the amateur sociology lesson out of the way, maybe you can understand the food that King's Noodle puts out. The restaurant represents that transition \"sandwich\" generation of Hong Kong immigrants, and the food reflects that perfectly -- it is a marked improvement over the fast-food style Chinese places, while not quite being able to match up to the quality and authenticity of the more recently opened restaurants in the suburbs.

Having said that, King's Noodle is among the best in the Chinatown area. They still make one of the best BBQ ducks to be had in the downtown core. The food is economical and the quality is mostly dependable. Service is down to the no frills, barebone essentials. Come here with realistic expectations and I don't think you will leave disappointed."}
{"text":"I was visiting Toronto for the first time from California, and it was my first meal in Chinatown.

I'd like to think I have a good experience with Chinese food, and I came here for dinner my first night in Toronto. Yes, we were seated very quickly, but the service here was straight garbage. The waitresses here have no regard for the customers and will blatantly ignore you even if you're right in front of their face. I'm not sure if thats the theme or the way they're trained here, but it certainly doesn't make me want to tip them well. If you're on a date, don't take your girl/guy here because the service here will make you look like a fool...

As far as the food goes, we ordered the beef with oyster sauce, the wonton soup, and a seafood dish. I've had these same dishes at other restaurants that were way better than they were here, and also gave way bigger portions for the relative price. I thought that the wonton soup was pretty good, but other than that, I would not go out of my way to eat at this restaurant. I think there are a lot of better options around the area to eat, and I just picked the wrong restaurant."}
{"text":"The glistening duck hanging from the window attracted me to go in. However I ordered the congee since it's a colder August afternoon. I came here alone for my lunch time and was sat at a round table with other random singletons. That's fine.  No big deal. I ordered the congee and it basically never came. Everyone else at the table got their food and I am still sitting there.  I finally waived a waitress down and asked her in Cantonese where my seafood congee is. Now I don't speak in Cantonese very often anymore so I suppose I advised her of a different kind of congee. She comes back to inquire if it was seafood and I said yes. Then she proceeding to scoff like why did I tell her something else. I heard her say more stuff under her breath as she walked by again later. She was not the only one. As I can understand Cantonese, everytime a customer disagrees or says something the waitresses don't like they talk to each other under their breath and mock the customer as they walk away.

The congee itself was watery. It was bland. I added some salt but it's not the same. I feel like the BBQ meats would be a better choice here. The dude next to me had a combo of chicken and duck on rice and it did look very fresh and crispy.

Final thought. I am willing to come back to try the BBQ meats on rice as the reviews are good on yelp. The service however was not pleasant."}
{"text":"on vacation in canada and it was a recommended place by my friends, had the shrimp churn fun, chinese broccoli, ja lurn (churn fun wrapping the fried stuff) and soy sauce noodles

the \"ja lurn\" was amazing, it was very fresh and soft, the fried thing in the middle was just right, not too crispy, crispy and soft

the churn fun was okay, the skin was kind of too thick, would like it if it was thinner

the soy sauce noodles were good, just about right

service was okay, can't expect much service when at an asian restaurant

this is definitely a must go if you go to canada for vacation, so many places to go to in canada to eat"}
{"text":"Do not understand the relatively high praise this place receives. While service was very good, the food was mediocre, and partly actually unappetizing. Might be because it was a busy night , but the dishes were sloppy, the flavoring was off, and on one noodle dish the sauce was slathered on to a excessive degree making it almost inedible. Attention to detail is greatly required ,would not go back."}
{"text":"Reliable place to go for Hong Kong style cafeteria food. Fast service and good prices."}
{"text":"This feels like your classic Chinese congee and noodle house. I've been here a couple of times and it's always busy; definitely a student haunt. 

Ironically, the egg noodles and wontons are not great, the wontons are starchy and the soup was not super hot. The fish congee was delicious and super hot and the hot and sour soup was exactly what it promised to be. The fried bread in rice paper (cannot for the life of me remember what this is called) was hot and fresh, but we had to ask for the peanut and hoisin sauce. 

I will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Not coming back here again! We ordered the BIG bowl of House special noodle soup and the stir-fry pea spouts..... Nothing special about either and the pea spouts was a bit too greasy... not only that, no one (waiters/waitresses) ever smiles... did someone die here? ..... I know, its a Chinese restaurant, but I feel like i'm at a mortuary... plus they don't clean their tables.... the waitress just brushed the dirty food onto the floor and started placing the 'new' plates, chopsticks, napkins on the table.... just glad I did not get sick.....also, if you use American dollars, they will charge you 10% .... most of the other restaurants do not.... so go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"I love the BBQ section of this restaurant, and usually whenever I'm in Chinatown this is the place where I'll order BBQ pork, soy chicken, etc. to bring home.

In terms of dining in, this place serves you the basics of Chinese non-dim sum cuisine, targeted mainly towards tourists. I'd also come here as well if I want a quick bite and am on a budget, as their noodle bowls are REALLY cheap.

Service is terrible. Once we were ignored for about 15 minutes when we were trying to flag someone for the bill. I mean, it IS a Chinese restaurant after all so that's sort of expected."}
{"text":"*more of a 3.5 stars*

On a weekend lunch, King's is completely packed but without a lineup- we got seated quickly. The decor is a bit odd- is the wall made out of christmas ornaments?- but definitely not off-putting. The vibe is super casual and really good for big groups, but if you're only dining for two it would be a bit of a squeeze.

The menu is extensive and rather overwhelming at first, but if you look through it there's a recurring theme with bbq pork, duck, or roast duck. Food gets served up really fast and the waitresses also move at the speed of lightning as well.

I don't recommend the noodles (the noodles are thin and yellow, nothing special) but the meat is really good! The bbq duck is to die for! The bbq pork tastes pretty nice, not the best but certainly quite good. Lemon coke is literally coke with a slice of lemon in it, and the fruit punch is really cute- it's full of jelly inside.

We ordered our own dishes and split a bbq duck (around $40-$50 I believe) and Chinese broccoli. Tips are included in the bill, and you pay together. I don't think you can separate it. I wouldn't mind coming back to eat again. 

Favorites: bbq duck! Pretty sure it's half of a duck"}
{"text":"There are so many similar restaurants around China Town. King's noodle as one of them doesn't have their unique and special food to let me remember them. Everything is just average, like food and service."}
{"text":"Great place to get quick chinese BBQ or even if you want a family style dinner. Service can be crappy at times, but there is one server who is realllllly nice. I usually order egg noodle soup with roast pork and a side of HAR CHUNG (shrimp in rice noodle roll). SOOOO GOOD

I've also had the congee, fried rice noodles, seafood.. everything is legit and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"All hail the most savory Shrimp Rice Flour Rolls in North America (well, at least the best in the immediate New York City, Philly, Boston, Toronto, Montreal area).  

King's is the quintessential bustling noodle shop.  The service is efficient and gruff in a good, assembly-line way.  There can be a wait, but it's worth it.  

The simple dishes are the best - Roast Duck or Pork over rice, Wonton Noodle Soup (heaping bowls), deep fried donut dough, even goose during the Christmas season.  

Great prices, communal seating - no frills, but by no means a dive.  

Did I mention the Rice Flour Rolls?  Who knew gelatinous goo could be SO GOOD!?"}
{"text":"Surprisingly I didn't have to wait to be seated on a weekend. The food is really good and they have a alot of selection. Good pricing as well. Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"BEST Beef and egg over rice noodles hands down! Usually it's over rice, but I tried theirs over noodles and it was the best tasting variation I've ever had! Didn't need soy sauce or chili paste! So delicious!

The Curry Squid rice plate was excellent!

The duck/BBQ pork noodle soup was good!

The wonton/dumpling noodle soup was good too!

Service was quick and place was clean."}
{"text":"All this time of growing up and living in the GTA, I still hadn't been to King's Noodle... until recently! Even in my childhood trips to Chinatown with my family, I recall this bright yellow sign in the midst of Spadina. 

Service here is fine, it's exactly what you'd expect at an Asian restaurant. They're not friendly, but they're not rude. Getting the job done ASAP is usually just the goal and they accomplished that. 

Food though... So disappointed! Seeing as this place has been a neighbourhood staple for such a long time I thought it must be good. Total tourist trap for Cantonese food :(
- Congee: Flavour was alright but the texture thoooough. Too thick and it seemed like it was made of rice flour instead of boiled down slowly from just rice. Making congee from rice flour is the shortcut that some restaurants do since it gives you a congee-ish texture in a much shorter duration of time and for less effort because you don't need to constantly stir to ensure it doesn't burn at the bottom of the pot. But the effect is just not the same as boiling raw rice until it breaks down. 
- Fried dough fritters: Not fresh enough... they fry huge batches that you can see at the front of their restaurants. But that means what you get is oil-soaked and cold.
- BBQ Duck: This was okay. You can definitely get better elsewhere, but still this was better than the other dishes we got.
- Fried beef rice noodles: Very average. Doesn't really have that wok-hei flavour that's iconic in fried dishes. 
- Fried veggies w/ garlic: This was yummy because it was so fresh when it came to our table! And fried with tonssss of garlic. Beware of garlic breath after eating haha.

Apparently their bbq duck with the slippery noodles is supposed to be really good here. So if I ever decide to come here again, I'll likely try more of their BBQ options. 

If you want some solid Chinese food, head north and hit up Markham or even Scarborough!"}
{"text":"the bbq prok wasnt that good because was too salty but the skin was very very crispy!!"}
{"text":"Food was good but was pissed at the arrogant service:

* Had OPEN sign flashing at 8am but lady in window shooed me away saying 9am 
* Wanted to put me at a communal table when there were 10 small tables available

* Charged me $28 for 3 BBQ items and gave me soy chicken instead of roast duck
* Another cash only bandit
* Service with stern no eye contact glance should be their motto"}
{"text":"Holy crap this place is busy. Came in at 8pm on a Tuesday and could barely squeeze in. Their ramen kitchen is in the front, and combined with the waitresses coming in and out and the mob of people waiting to be seated, right away there's this huge bottleneck of activity.

Got seated and decided to splurge for the wonton and duck ramen. I wouldn't say it was the best ramen I've had - Chinatown can definitely do better. The noodles were firm and thin, but they were the kind that you can get anywhere else. The broth was kind of watery and not very flavorful at all - didn't even have the very salty taste that you usually get with ramen broth. The wontons were OK - they had the shrimp filling that was very similar to the filling in shrimp har gow dim sum.

Highlight of the entire dish was definitely the duck - soo flavourful and tender. It kept it's flavour even in the broth. Next time I'm not going to waste my time on the ramen. I'm going straight for the BBQ meats."}
{"text":"I have only gotten one thing here... BBQ ROAST PORK. It's the one with the crispy bubbly skin.

I brought it to a \"pork\" party (yes, we had one) and it was a hit!! The skin was so crispy, I had the whole party drooling over it.

If you're looking for crispy BBQ roast pork, look no further!"}
{"text":"I am in like with King's Noodle Restaurant.  

Since moving from Toronto, there are many things I miss, but easily one of the top five is stopping in at King's for a bowl of something noodle-y and meaty before doing some grocery shopping.

Price?  Awesome.  Honestly, if you're like me and you just want a simple bowl of meat, noodles, bok choy, and broth, this is the place to go for a proper bowl at a good price.  I've walked out full for way less than $15, or even $10.  

Quality?  Since the place is usually so packed with both restaurant eaters and bbq take-outers, you can be guaranteed that what you get is fresh.  The meat is always glistening with fat, plentiful, and flavorful.  The noodles have a great bite.  The broth does its job as broth and doesn't overpower any of the meat flavors.  

Atmosphere?  It's a bbq/noodle shop.  It's busy, loud, casual, fast-paced, no nonsense.  Love it.  Order, eat, enjoy, pay, go.  If it's really busy, expect to share a table if you're alone or with a small group.  

Is it the best?  No.  Sometimes the cuts of meat are kinda \"meh\", and I think we've all had better bbq meats and noodle soups...but for quality, convenience, and cost, it's a winner."}
{"text":"Quick and no frills service. Packed with people on weekday evening. I was expecting a lot more Chinese customers, but most of the sit down customers are non-Asian and to-go customers are Asian. 

Ordered the most basic cha siu pork wonton noodle soup. Nothing too special. The soup is flavoured, but nothing worth remembering. Good volume for the price, around 14 dollars after tax. Will keep on trying the different options around the area next time I'm around."}
{"text":"First time review.  CASH ONLY!

Ordered the duck, wonton, noodle soup and noodle dish along with the donut wrapped in rice roll because that's what most people on Yelp recommended.

The beautifully glazed duck was served room temp and it's bone in.  And the cheap thin yellow noodles itself had 
absolutely no flavor on its own. 

Price was very cheap but flavor wise, it was just mediocre.  I thought the duck would be warm, it was not.  And I hate de-boning meats.  So that to me was very annoying.  I'm used to eating crispy duck skin but these were mushy.  The glaze was delicious but I just couldn't swallow any more gelatinous mushy duck skin.

Other tables were ordering udon like noodles, rice, sizzling platters and those looked really yummy.  I'd come back but only to try hot items.

Service and the speed was very efficient.  I liked how they had roasted meat take-out counter with a scale in the front for those who want to just buy and go."}
{"text":"I was craving roasted duck, so decided to give this place a try.  The duck was good, but would have been better if it was served warm.  

Since the place is called \"King's Noodle\" I had to try a bowl of won ton noodle soup.  While the noodle and wonton itself was good, the broth was very plain and lacked any salt or dimension.

The food appeared very average to me."}
{"text":"I had their noodles here and it's good! One of the best BBQ roasted duck i ever had! The fruits stores around there are really good too if you want to look for exotic fruits. 

They have alot of cheap items you can call and try. My experience is food in Toronto are pretty expensive comparing to the US so this is a super value cheap eat place and it's good!"}
{"text":"Decent enough. The prices are fair for the location. Staff are a little rude. The other problem is that they only accept cash and wouldn't let my friends and I leave the restaurant to use the bank across the street. Ended up we had to call a friend to bring some cash over and it delayed all of our time. Very selfish inconvenience for a restaurant this big in such a prime location."}
{"text":"It's great they're open late! The service is far worse than most stereotypical Asian late night restaurants but once you get past that, it's good! The workers there are very hard working, they were cleaning everything and refilling everything throughout my whole time there."}
{"text":"Buyers beware! Went there recently with a party of 3 (!) and we were wondering why the price seemed a bit higher than expected. Below at the bottom was a tip they conveniently added without telling us! We were outraged because we were not informed and they would have happily accepted tip on tip! Be cautious!!"}
{"text":"The roast pork is delicious. 

Chicken with ginger sauce over rice is awesome and super cheap. Prices are VERY reasonable. 

Stick to the bbq style items."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for almost thirty years, but they are just as good as ever. Believe it or not, their service has greatly improved over the years.
While they are a \"Noodle House\" they are also famous for their Congee and Chinese BBQ, but their menu is not limited to those items either. Their price is reasonable, some may even find them cheap.
If you come he during peak hours, be prepare to share table if you have less than a party of four."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. As a traveler from NYC, I've heard abt all the good Cantonese food in Toronto. So I decided to give this a try in Chinatown since I see many local dine here as we'll. I ordered a roast pork wanton noodle for $10, aside that the portion is huge, out of the 5 wantons I was given, only 1 have small piece of shrimp in it. My first Chinese food experience in Toronto is disappointing. Later on, my fd told me all the good food are in Markham."}
{"text":"Order the ribs. They're worth the wait. And the iced coffee and shrimp dumplings and steamed buns. Great experience."}
{"text":"Get there early and be prepared to share a table with strangers !
We sat at the big table right inside the front door, it was a bit chilly. There were 5 of us, we had the large bowl of won ton soup, 3 plates of rice and BBQ pork, 2 pop and  a beer for under $40. Food was good, service was fast and price was right.
 I am a believer !"}
{"text":"Went there on a late night. Awful. Awful service. After we ordered we were told that we only had 10 minutes to eat because they were starting to close. Then they started cleaning all the floors with something that smelled horrible, like a dirty swimming pool, as we ate. Horrible experience, probably won't go back again. Which sucks because the food was actually pretty good."}
{"text":"Always consistent, fresh and yummy! I have always had good service and yummy soups! The portions are generous!"}
{"text":"Like the place.  Most things I have had there have been acceptable.  HOWEVER, can be a bit on the greasy side.  Have not tried their jjeok here - maybe next time."}
{"text":"One of the best soups I have ever had (BBQ pork, duck and wonton)
Miam"}
{"text":"Our first spot to eat while in Chinatown! We had a family dinner style grub. It has 2 lobster, a main dish some stir fry veggies and a bowl of crab soup. All for 40 bucks and fed 2 adults and 3 teenagers. A typical Chinese style sit down dinner, with not so happy servers haha. But the food was good n cheap."}
{"text":"A good place to satisfy your Chinese food craving. I love the congee and garlic sprouts. Don't mind the unpleasant bathroom and remember most Chinese restaurants are similar in this fashion bc they focus on the food. Service is fast and they speak English quite well so don't feel uncomfortable to try it out."}
{"text":"The surprisingly amazing thing about Toronto is that you can find delicious eats from all over the world right in this beautiful city. Toronto is just packed with restaurants, breweries and bars that feature all types of food, from the super casual to the exclusive fine-dining. If you watch the Travel Channel, you will probably know of the TV show: Bizarre Foods with Andrew Zimmern. From this show, there is an episode called \"Toronto: Horse Heart and Flipper Pie.\" Here, he takes us to his food travels in Toronto, with one restaurant called King's Noodle Restaurant in the heart of Toronto's Chinatown. What's so special about this place? Just one thing: ROAST PORK.

Right when you walk in, you will find a Chinese chef to your right preparing unlimited bowls of their exclusive famous dish, the one most ordered for: roast pork and wonton noodle in soup. There is a constant stream of people walking in and out, either ordering take-out or doing a quick sit-and-dine to wolf down this dish!

My friend and i literally slurped this take-out in our rental car right outside of the \"return spot.\" Yes, we were that pressed for time, but that didn't stop us from trying this dish. Even as take-out, it's better than nothing right?

And you know what? It was unbelievable......

The noodles were thin and cooked perfectly al dente to give it that firmness that every thin noodle needs for that perfect texture to chew on. The roast pork had that perfect 1cm surface of crispy and crunchy skin to contrast with the intensely soft and chewy layer of fat that was still attached right on. I did not feel unhealthy to eat this. This tasted way too good, like a little piece of heaven packed right in this take-out box. How amazing is that?!  The bok choy was soft yet firm at the same time. The broth was amazingly savory and just added on packs of comforting juicy flavors to the roast pork.

This is one of those noodle soup dishes where I try to eat and drink at the same time! You just got to. Chew on the roast pork and some noodles and slurp on some savory broth at the same time so that each chew on the pork releases dense flavors onto the broth for you to swallow. AHHHH.. This was heaven in a take-out box (an hour later).

Pros:
-very fast and speedy service, but hey! you get your food faster!
-everything is made fresh on the spot, you can watch them if you want to!
-DELICIOUS, DELICIOUS, DELICIOUS FOOD

Cons:
-can be a long wait during the weekends, but that's not their fault
-parking may be difficult, try to find street parking and walk a bit or opt for a parking lot
-small restaurant with limited tables so must come early!"}

{"text":"I just love a simple comfort food such as a hot bowl of wonton soup on a cool rainy night.
I went to Hong Kong and Singapore twice last year and this year, each time I always had wonton or su kow soup with noodle.

 This is my 1st time in Toronto so I checked in Yelp for recommendation, we went to King's noodle in Chinatown, the restaurant was bright and cheerful, it was quite crowded at 9pm. Service was fast, the wonton dumplings were plump and tasty, the veggie was cooked, the broth was also tasty. The duck leg noodle soup was a huge bowl, the duck was so flavorful, better than what I had in Vancouver, as good as what I had in Hong Kong, the broth was out of this world good, I sucked up the last drop! it was actually cheaper than what they charged in HK and the portion 4 times the tiny bowl they served in HK. 5 stars for the noodle soup.

 We came back again and had the duck soup and the sizzling shrimp. This nice restaurant was open till 1am! I wish I could come back but we are from California in Toronto to go to the Niagara falls. If you want fast service, good Chinese BBQ and seafood at an affordable price, ths is the place to go to, beware that they only take cash."}
{"text":"I miss this place sooo much! They have the best Chinese in the city. I tried the chicken chow mein and pepper steak and not only do they give you a massive amount of food but it is a must when you visit Toronto. If i had the time to go back i would just eat there and then fly home. Now that my love of Chinese has grown i really want to go back and try their chicken fried rice, orange chicken, kung pao and many other delicious cuisines that are authentic as they get.!"}
{"text":"Excellent Cantonese Chinese food. Just like in Hong Kong. Every dish we ordered was a hit. 
We had Yang Chow Fried rice, seafood pan fried noodles, garlic sautéed peapod leaves, and a roast duck. I usually don't like duck but I like theirs. It's not that fatty or oily, which is why I like King's."}
{"text":"No frills - no nonsense - cash only.

If you want good Chinese BBQ then this is your place. The BBQ pork is the real standout for me, its tender, juicy and perfectly cooked. Their duck is also well done, but a little salty for my taste - and that's with the expectation of Chinese BBQ. Something that sets them apart a little is the goose on the menu, definitely worth giving a shot. Rich, meaty, crispy and fatty. I found that it's a little pricier than you'd expect, but worth every penny."}
{"text":"Living in DC drives me nuts about Chinese food, because there is no good one in downtown DC's Chinatown.  I happened just seen an episode of Bizarre Food America set in Toronto.  This was one of the restaurant featured in the show.  This is as authentic Hong Kong Cantonese food as you can get!  I had the Dough Stick wrapped Rice Lasagna, Roast Duck, BBQ Roast Pork, Vegetables, Singapore Vermicelli, and Spicy Sausage with Rice in Clay Pot.  Everything was delicious.  The Rice in Clay Pot will take half an hour, but everything else comes very fast.  This place has dim sum also, though I had not tried. It opens for business from 9 am in the morning.  If you fancy a Chinese breakfast, rice porridge with an assortment of meat or fish with fried dough stick, this is the place for you.  This is a MUST place for me when I am in Toronto now.

The prices were cheaper than we pay in NYC and the quality a little better. The menu is more extensive than any in NYC and the stand outs were creamed corn crispy grouper, greens and of course the BBQ. Also they have Chinese  doughnut  sticks. I haven't had those in a while they were a treat! But we tried other Toronto Chinese restaurants that were much better. But it was good just not a must try!

$11/lb!"}
{"text":"We ordered take out from kings noodles because our usual House of gourmet is currently closed for renovations. 

The first thing we noticed was the price, it's $1-$2 more than house of gourmet.  Not a big deal. When we got home and open up our take out, my husband was quite disappointed because the duck and chicken he got were all bones with very little meat and there wasn't many pieces either. The beef with vegetables stir fried was really good imo. It had a lot of \"wok\" flavour to it.  A taste that most Chinese look for when they dine at Chinese restaurants. Its similar to the charcoal taste when you BBQ but instead it's from a wok. 

Perhaps this is just an one off incident, I think we will give Kings noodles another shot by dining in instead of take out."}
{"text":"I have been going to King Noodle every time I visit toronto.  I think the food is great, especially the shrimp-laden wontons.  The bbq fare is good as well.  I would caution anyone to try more than the casual chinese cuisine.  I ordered the \"BC clams in black sauce\" for about $12.  what I got was very few clams on a bed of lettuce!!!  I could not believe what a scam this was.  About 1/3 what other chinese restaurants in the area would serve for that cost.  That said, stick to King Noodle's bread and butter:  noodle soups, noodles, or BBQ duck, pork, or crispy pork and you will have a delicious meal.  also, when you pay up front, there is a place for you to deposit your tip.  Don't leave it at the table.  I noticed the person who cleared the table taking it and not our waitress.  Also, the decor is much nicer than it used to be but if you are single or with someone else, expect to be seated close or even at the same table as others.  No big deal..."}
{"text":"*CASH ONLY* 

I haven't been to King's Noodle in a few years but seems like they have renovated in the last year or so. The decor is pretty clean at least in comparison to other Chinatown restaurants.

King's Noodle has great congee at very affordable prices. My favourite is the classic preserved egg and shredded pork.  The pork and duck with noodles dish was great too.

I have usually opted for House of Gourmet nearby on Dundas, but I'll definitely be coming back to King's Noodle for their congee and pork. 

Service (or lack thereof) is as you'd expect from an Asian restaurant. Nevertheless, it's a good place for an affordable and tasty meal."}
{"text":"Boy Andrew Zimmern you got this one wrong!

Tried  the noodle soup with brisket. The meat and noodles are great but soup broth is BLAND! Noodle soup from Hong Kong is so much better! The egg roll was pretty lame too. All it had was cabbage! I Liked the sticky rice with salted egg as it actually tasted okay with  some vinegary soy sauce. The sautéed snow peas veggies had too much stalk instead of the tender tips. I felt like a cow or a horse trying to chew on it. 

I was a embarrassed I had to drag my Mom to try it with me. Sorry Mom! My bad. Errrr.... well no! Blame it on Baldy!

I had to travel from California to try this out but what big miss!"}
{"text":"Giving this place 4 stars for the food. Its actually more authentic than 'Canadianized' cheap Chinese places, and most of the dishes I had here actually had the wow factor. You can't go wrong with any of the bbq dishes and for those you who attempt to eat healthy, the mixed vegetables as a side will compliment your proteins. Service is meh, but that's typical in Chinatown."}
{"text":"I used to love this place. Ate here probably 3-4 times a week. Until recently I got a takeout here (Duck with wonton and noodle). As I started eating the food I realized there was a cockroach stuck to the piece of meat. I will never eat here again."}
{"text":"I remember King's Noodles as a family favourite and we use to frequent it on our annual pilgrimages to Toronto.  Since I've been living in Toronto on my own, I've found other options so I haven't been back to King's for awhile.

We decided to drop in for dinner on a Tuesday night (only because Gold Stone is closed on Tuesdays).  Ordered the BBQ duck on rice dish ($6.95) and seafood fried noodles ($10.95).

Service was alright but the tables for 2 were placed very close together and left little elbow space.

Our duck was the fattiest I have ever seen...not sure if they were trying to fatten us for the feast or just gave us the reject duck of the day.  Seafood noodles were good but portion seemed skimpy.  We always have leftovers whenever we order the same dish at Gold Stone.

I'll pass on coming back and stick to Gold Stone like the creature of habit that I am."}
{"text":"I loved the authentic look of King's Noodle on Yelp and when walking into the restaurant.  

First off, spoiler alert, I hated it.

We got seated quickly as the turn over rate for smaller tables is fast.  The menu is pretty extensive for what I thought to be a basic noodle place.  They have your staples of \"cha siu\", chicken, duck, and roasted pork.  The protein can be accompanied with rice or noodles or just by it self.

Second, the service is dismal.  The lady we got was irritated, rude, and downright bitchy.  We wanted fried noodles but not to the crisp of Cantonese noodles and we were trying to tell her that. She gave us mad attitude. \"Crunchy right? Like canto noodle!!?\"  We told her no and she rolled her eyes and sighed. We should eyeroll you, we already told you not like Canto style. This went on for 3 minutes where we just relented and ordered something different and uncompletely satisfying (read on below).

1. We got duck with egg noodles.  The egg noodles were soggy. Like sooo soggy when I wanted the chewy al-dente kind.  I left half of that mess in the bowl. The duck was mostly fat but it was well roasted and I loved the flavour.
2. We got a \"run ground\" chicken. This thing was so poorly cut that bone fragments was bombarding us when we tried eating it. It was very greasy and not the clean, aromatic chicken I was expecting. It costed $22.50 as well. For half a damn chicken...
3. Cha siu & chicken with rice. My sister had this and it was fine but not praise worthy.
4. My boyfriend (poor guy) got the \"something different\". First off, she didn't get fried noodles like we stated. He had the soggy egg noodles that I suffered through. The beef was thick cut which was good. But the kitchen dumped a lot of gooey Chinese sauce on the WHOLE dish. We said we only wanted soy sauce... Fine. My boyfriend ate 3 bites and left the whole plate on the table as it was honestly disgusting.

The only saving grace was:
1. Their duck 
2. Their rice dish

The place gives off an overall dirty vibe as everybody working is sweaty. The dishes and utensils felt sticky. 

No thanks."}
{"text":"This place has super rude service. I've come to expect that somewhat in Chinatown restaurants but, wow...the service was so rude that it ruined my experience. 

We got an order of salted donut, hot and sour soup, noodles with dumplings and BBQ duck plus spring rolls. The spring rolls were good, as was the salted donut. The small size of the hot and sour soup was a huge portion - way too sour for me though, I barely ate any. The dumplings were delicious, as were the noodles. The BBQ duck was cold and unappetizing - huge disappointment. Every portion was absolutely gigantic. Very generously sized, and we had a lot leftover to take home. 

But from having our menus literally thrown at us, to being questioned about why we need multiple plastic bags for our takeout (we only needed two bags, and it's because we live in different homes...but why should I have to explain that?) to having a lady literally tap on the tip jar in my face, while I cashed out...

The food was good, but just average and certainly not enough to deal with the borderline abusive behaviour here."}
{"text":"I've had 3 visit here now and each one has been quite a different experience. The menu is big and has lots of different options.

Today I tried #63 (I saw someone at the next table eating it and it looked badass) - a giant soup with wonton dumplings, seafood, noodles and some bok choy. Perfect hangover meal. Highly recommend this one.

I tried the bbq meats the first time around. These were delish (pork and duck served over rice), but I was more impressed by the free soup we were given with our meal, which was a basic broth with all sorts of veggies. (I know, I know, I'm easily impressed)

On my second visit I tried an egg drop soup (tasty!) along with a couple items off the $2.50 dim sum menu. Har gow (decent) and some of those sweet buns filled with custard...mmmmm

Lots more menu items me to try, so I suspect repeat visits.

Bonus point for having nice-ish decor and OK bathrooms."}
{"text":"Yikes. Rudest service ever and mediocre food. 
The lady pointed at a table without a word. No greeting, nothing.  Literally threw the tea(that spilled) and dishes on the table. Took another 5 mn to bring ONE menu... we were TWO people. Ignored us for a nice long while we were obviously ready to order. We ordered two full dishes (one duck, one veggie). That's all? She asked with a rude voice . The duck came first. The veggies 10 minutes later, once the duck was cold. 
Duck was moist but way too salty, we did not finish it. Veggies were plenty but swimming in oil.  Food was 'thrown' on the table, just like the tea, then the bill. Not a word . Nothing. 
Same with the lady at the cash, except she  screamed something in Chinese as we were leaving.My guess is that she did not like that I left only $1.00 tip. But hey, it is cash only. Which means tax evasion. These people don't pay the income tax they should. That is their tip right there."}
{"text":"Great value. I usually get the roast duck bowl which is enough for me but for a hungry appetite I would say to get the plate. The sauce they use is delicious and the roast duck is very good too."}
{"text":"An OK 3.0 not more.

Food is fresh and made of good ingredients and tastes better than Gourmet, whose quality really fluctuated and deteriorated lately. However, overall,  bbq duck is good but soup tastes relatively bland. Place is relatively noisy and waiters love to pack customers."}
{"text":"I grew up eating at this place. It has been here forever. When I was a kid and didn't live in Toronto, my parents would take us here from time to time after a day of grocery shopping in Chinatown. It looks a lot nicer now then when it was just a hole and served good food. Now the food is still good, still cheap, and a lot more comfortable to dine in. Service is still typically Chinese - they get you in and get you out as quickly as possible. And yes, the noodles are bomb. Get them."}
{"text":"Kings Noodle is located In Chinatown.  Right at Spadina and Dundas.  I've been to King's Noodle Restaurant maybe 10 years ago. When I visited this restaurant today it looks totally different. They did a complete renovation to it. It's looks a lot better and much cleaner and more modern.  The front looks pretty much the same with the ducks and roasted porks hanging from the front glass window. I had the bbq duck with milk noodle soup and my friend had the roasted pork and wonton milk noodle soup.  We both shared the donut fritter wrapped with rice rolls.  Food was authentic and tasty.  The soup broth was not overly filled with MSG.  Food was a bit lukewarm but all in all great food. I can't comment on service since it's Chinatown. Most restaurants have poor service.  You're there more for the cheap food than the great service."}
{"text":"Expensive restaurant.

I believed that a plate of fried calamari shouldn't cost $21. There wasn't even any calamari tasted to it, the calamaris were mushy and the batter just blah..... 

Will avoid going to this place if in ChinaTown. I have so many other choices."}
{"text":"This restaurant by far is the worst that I've been to when is comes to shrimp wontons noodle soup. The broth had no steam coming off of it.. the shrimp wontons looked like they were on life support..... shrimp tasted like the ones in the yellow bag at no frills..... and then the cleaning lady had the nerve to mop the whole restaurant with the dirty mop laced with bleach while customers  are eating so I had to smell bleach the whole entire time.....it could have just been a bad day but I'm never going back to this restaurant.... and they should be ashamed to have shrimp wonton soup on the menu. It's all good you got me once I usually don't write reviews but this place was just that bad.... rotten ass mop head smh"}
{"text":"Why are people complaining about the service? Sure, it's a bit brusque, but it's quick and always crowded, so be happy they turn the tables. If you want attentive service, go somewhere else. If you want good food at great prices, this is a place for you.

I love this place. One of the best in the downtown Chinatown. Especially recommended: all the noodle soups (I like duck and wonton) and the donut in rice noodle. Excellent flavor to the broth without being fatty. Meat is rich, and everything is generously portioned for the price. Good place to take kids or eat alone, as it is always noisy to begin with."}
{"text":"I had \"bbq pork and wonton noodle soup\" and \"bbq duck and wonton noodle soup\" here. They were both awesome and under $10. The broth provides a simple, light and hot background for the meats, wonton, and greens, all of which were prepared perfectly right. Greens were not overcooked.  A generous serving of BBQ pork was some of the best I have ever had. Each wonton had a shrimp, pork and chives in it. I don't remember exactly, but I think there were 5 or 6 of them in a bowl. Noodle was thin but firm and had a nice texture. You can get a bowl of bbq pork noodle soup (without wontons) for $4.35!"}
{"text":"Now, I've only been here once.  And all i had was their minced pork and century egg congee.  I am a huge fan of congee and they serve a good amount.  There really a science or expectation for flavour as congee is most on the bland side of things which is why i love it for breakfast!  Have it with a their fried dough fritter and you're golden."}
{"text":"Great noodles and prices. We had the soups and dumplings and several other small dishes. Very good. The line was very long to get in, but it moved quickly. The restaurant is very small and crowded, but this is expected in an authentic Chinatown. Cash only."}
{"text":"Will Never return after coming here for years! We were generally pretty happy with the dishes. Service is fast but space is pretty cramped. Usually feels like the wait staff might knock into you along the aisle. 

Today they made several minor mistakes of bringing us other people's food and bring our food to other tables.

But the final straw were the RIDICULOUS prices of things. We're pretty sure they made them up because the prices weren't what we expected from the menu. A standard plate of roast pork was $16 when the menu said $8.75, 1/2 a free range chicken was $20, baby snow pea tips with garlic was $16 and stir fried shanghai bok choy with beef was a whopping $21!! Are you kidding me? Three people ate for $100 and that was 4 dishes with 3 white rice bowls and nothing fancy! We then got charged 10% tip on top of their final total (which was miscalculated). We had to look at the bill 3 times. The silver lining was the \"free\" soybean pudding we received.

Don't wanna get scammed, don't come here!"}
{"text":"I rarely go to eat Chinese food these days. But If I do have craving, this is the only place I would go despite the fact that they have crappiest n slowest service! 

This place has the BEST BBQ PORK unlike anywhere else! They are juicy, tender, lean, flavorful! There wont be fatty parts on em, or occasional odd smell from pork I have gotten from other restaurants. Everything from this place is pretty good, 

The interior decor is very modern n contemporary which make them stand out in China town. Seating are comfortable. 

Highly recommend  this place!! But if  you are in a rush, you wont want to go there."}
{"text":"It's really cheap foods, good taste but too much people eating as too busy, Its too messy environments. But I like here"}
{"text":"My family's go-to restaurant in Chinatown. 
I remember coming here as a kid and they still have some of the same wait staff. It tends to get crowded so you might be sharing a table with fellow diners. 
As with most Chinese restaurants, the price is great for the portions received. You can easily have  a 2 person dinner for under $20.
My favourite is the wonton in soup, but the congee with a side of donuts, stir fried rice noodles as well as the fresh meat in the display window are also hits."}
{"text":"Decent Chinese food in the heart of China Town. There are a LOT of options to choose from so it's hard to really know what's best. I got #253 and it was really good.
However there were some not so great things to point out. We got seated right away but no one came to take our drink order for about 10 minutes. By that time we knew what we wanted to order so we placed the food order at the same time. My food came out first, then a couple minutes later our drinks came out, then another 5 minutes later my friend's food came out. Not to be rude, I waited and didn't eat until she received her meal. It wasn't that busy but the wait staff was hard to get a hold of.
The most important thing to note is that they ONLY TAKE CASH! I don't know how that's possible but it's true."}
{"text":"Your typical Chinatown restaurant - not the friendliest service, but super fast and the restaurant is clean. This place has been a Chinatown staple since I was a child and I've been coming here my entire life. BBQ pork and duck on rice w/gravy is my favorite. Their curry rice is delish as well."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place when I am in the Dundas/Spadina area for lunch.
Very large generous servings (and priced accordingly!) 
I found it a little more $ than other but it's still worth it imho.

Typical of Chinese BBQ restaurants, the food is decently good.
And untypically of Chinese BBQ restaurants, the decor is actually quite nice!

Can be quite crowded during lunch so be prepared to share a table with strangers.

Parking can be challenging on Spadina so look for the Green P parking on the SE corner of Spadina and Dundas."}
{"text":"Do not fear the hanging ducks and chickens and pigs. Come to King's Noodle and keep your eyes straight ahead if you must, but go at least once.

Someone else mentioned the rice rolls...SO DELICIOUS. Probably the best I've ever had, even counting from dim sum places. That alone made my day better. Everything else is alright -- you can get the same stuff in Scarborough for cheaper but it's decently cheap for downtown.

I will have to agree with whoever said the menu is confusing -- it's about 10 pages filled with listings, a lot of which sound like they're the same things being repeated. I'd stick with the soups and the rice bowls (you can get smaller servings for one person instead of sharing a dish) but they charge extra for silly things like vegetables and fried egg ($2 each I believe). May as well get another dish that won't end up costing you $12 by the end of it.

This place is actually really nice inside, and I'm told the menu is very authentically Chinese. So all in all, it's a great option for Spadina. And everyone should have the rice rolls because they are phenomenal."}
{"text":"Ordered minced beef congee with Chinese donuts... The beef didn't look cooked properly (still pink) imo. But anyway it still tasted good. Forgot to take pic of congee."}
{"text":"I arrived at the restaurant with a party of 5 just before 6 o'clock. Although the restaurant is well-known for their barbecued meats, I have already bought the barbecued items before, and decided to order the chicken rice in a clay pot, the beans in a black bean sauce, and two noodle dishes. Overall the food was decent, and what was to be expected from a Chinese restaurant. However, the beans in the black bean sauce were a little salty. I would like to come back here again, and try the congee and the barbecued menu items."}
{"text":"Good food, clean, affordable. More spacious than other restaurants I've been to in Chinatown."}
{"text":"I love their roast pork on rice. A quick to go meal has never disappointed. The skin is crispy as hell and the lady at the counter is pretty quick."}
{"text":"- Food is delicious
- Service is poor
- Cash only
- Cashier demanded tips for the poor service, I gave nothing.
The restaurant typically gives free soup when you ask.  I asked for soup and she said she was too busy to serve me (with an attitude).  Mind you, she said it in Cantonese which makes it more rude the way she said it."}
{"text":"The duck is excellent, if not the best I have ever tasted. Combined with a rice over soy chicken, it would definitely be my last meal request. Other dishes looks fine too, but I can't vouch for the quality of them. 

Remember, duck and chicken."}
{"text":"The restaurant was really clean & the food was very average. We tried the bbq pork noodle soup, fish ball noodle soup, beef rice noodle roll, egg roll, sticky rice. All the flavor was quite bland and the sticky rice was dry. Would avoid the egg roll. The noodles were meh, okay option."}
{"text":"Definitely lives up to their name of King noodle. I've ordered the roast duck noodle and it was very delicious. The duck and soup was really flavorful. The noodles weren't soggy or too hard. I also tried the beef tendon noodles and the tendons were very soft and flavorful. You also can't go wrong with the prices!  I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This place is authentic Hong Kong style \"jok fun min\" (congee rice noodle) restaurant. Perfect Cantonese \"jok\" (congee) and \"zaa leung\" (fried dough sticks aka Chinese donuts wrapped in rice noodles). Will definitely head back!

These were delicious and highly recommended:

- preserved egg and pork congee. This was thick, smooth, and immensely flavourful like it should be! Really delicious! 

- \"zaa leung\" (fried dough w/ rice noodles). The dough was perfectly crispy outside and puffy soft through the middle, wrapped in delightfully soft rice noodles, topped with scallions and sesame seeds

- shrimp won ton and duck noodle soup

- gai lan (chinese broccoli), boiled, with oyster sauce


These were good:
- beef brisket noodle soup
- pork liver congee

These were mediocre:
- bbq pork. Too chewy, maybe overcooked, but otherwise good flavour.
- \"tong choi\" (not sure what the english is for this veg). Chef stir fried it to death.

Bonuses:
- Surprisingly clean.
- Ample seating (though expect to queue a short while anyway at dinner time).

Minuses:
- MSG + Salt = thirsty

Pay no heed to the other reviewers who just ordered fried rice and bbq pork over rice and failed to try the above wonderful dishes!"}
{"text":"Looks good. Presentation is good. Clean looking restaurant. Food is a notch below. At least it was clean. Congee tastes diluted. Most diluted tasting congee ive had in a while. The beef curry was oily.. Ok tasty but not too much substance."}
{"text":"i love this place. I love getting their wonton noodles and a rice dish with some cantonese BBQ meats here. there are plenty of other restaurants near by that make similar dishes but i feel like this place just makes it the best. Huge wontons. The bbq meats here are always very nicely seasoned. Prices are always very reasonable for a store down in downtown. I always make sure i stop by here whenever i'm back in town. Highly recommend you try it as well."}
{"text":"This restaurant has good food at a very reasonable price.  The service is less than stellar but fast.  Eat great, even late!"}
{"text":"As long as I've been around, King's Noodle has been around.  It's the place to go for roast duck and noodles, Chinese fritters (yau tiu in Cantonese), and congee.  However, recently I think King's Noodle is resting too much on its laurels.  The last time I went, several days ago, something strange had happened.  They had re-renovated (unheard of with Chinese restaurants!) and the prices had also gone up!  Mind you, not for the noodles, but I was surprised to see dishes that cost over $15, which seemed a bit strange at a Chinese greasy spoon.  Also in the \"charcuterie\" section at the front of the restaurant, a roast duck is now $20, which is also insane (anywhere else it's around $15).  

Similarly, some of the food that I love there also seemed lacklustre.  The roast duck was soggy and cold, which is unusual since it's usually crisp on the outside and warm on the inside.  The fritters were cold, soggy and super greasy.  All in all, disappointing!

As it has been for decades, service is still brisk and brusque, and it's quick to get a seat here but they are also quick to rush you out of your seat.  You might also find yourself eating with strangers at a larger table."}
{"text":"Bad, tasteless and cold food + rude careless service = horrible dining experience.

We practically left half of our food behind. In order to eat the half that we did manage to eat, we had to drown it in soy and hot sauce. Everything was slimy and smelled weird.

Don't be fooled by the amount of people you see, there is nothing good about this place. 

Your in the heart of Chinatown with several other good options. Try all others first!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for weekend morning breakfast/brunch so I can only speak for this place before 11am on a weekend morning. 

Whenever I'm in the mood for a Chinese breakfast, I come to King's Noodle sit between 10-11am and the restaurant is about 1/3 full. My order usually consists of a Seafood Congee (since I don't eat pork or beef - this is one of the only options), a breadstick rice roll or sweet doughnut roll. 

The Seafood Congee (around 6$ for a medium/large bowl) consists of some shrimp, scallops, and fish. Their congee is very creamy and is usually on point every time I go. The breadstick rice roll (around 4$) can be quite salty at times so it's a hit or miss. The sweet doughnut roll is crispy with a good amount of bread in between so it makes for a filling combination with the congee. I always leave with a full belly. 

The service is laid back as is the case with many Chinese restaurants. They don't come to you unless you call them and they can be hard to flag down if they're not looking at you. You just have to be tenacious and patient. Usually, I ask for everything when I put down an order to avoid flagging someone down. Also, since this place is very popular for take out, orders may take a while but that all depends on how busy they are. (Reason for docked star)

Overall, like I said, this is my go to place because I do really like their congee and my belly always leaves content. If you don't need good service, this is a good place to go!"}
{"text":"not a bad place to eat ... middle of the night and crave some bbq duck on rice/noodle.

This place beats goldstone x100000 ...  service is at least quite good here and seats are roomy.  

i would come back if i was craving some late night noodle soup in spadina."}
{"text":"King Noodle is pretty nice. They have a large menu and many good dishes. You can also buy your fried dough  here fresh to go to eat with your congee at home. It is also open very late like midnight when most of chinatown is closed.

The downside that I do not mind is it is really busy and they want you in and out to serve new customers. In terms of dishes, I think the BBQ duck is pretty good, but these are generally cheap dishes for them to serve. They also have other nice dishes, I just need to learn how to order them now. Not all dishes I think are worthwhile though. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Does Chinatown even serve good value Chinese food anymore? I don't know, seems like they've all moved to Scarborough or what not but hey if you're actually in Chinatown AND craving Chinese food? Then yeah I'd recommend King's Noodle.

You haaaaave to get their barbequed pork (or any barbequed meat actually) - it's roasted to perfection. I also love getting their freshly made shrimp rice rolls and wontons. It's actually my favourite place to get wonton soup! I get the place wonton and soup though without the noodles cause the portion of noodles is massive.

This place was recently renovated so it's a lot cleaner inside now. Service is meh, I mean, are you surprised? A bit pricier than what you'd find elsewhere but it's still decently priced.

This place is probably one of your best bets for good Chinese food in Chinatown."}
{"text":"This is my favourite rice noodle place in Chinatown.
There were so many Hong Kong style cafes in Chinatown. This one is probably the best one. They got noodle soup specials for around 4 dollars. Plus, this place is near my university, so I went there a lot during my university.
I don't like the yellow egg noodle, but I am a fan of rice noodle. To me, this place probably has the best rice noodle, tender and does not fall apart.
I usually go by myself, so the waitress usually send me to share the big table with other people. So I got to sit with many many strangers.
Like in Hong Kong, the waitress are busy and impatient (usually unavailable). But they ran this place at incredible efficiency.
I usually drank the soup first, then add chili sauce and vinegar, stir up the noodles and eat. Yes, I am strange and I am probably the one person who eats this way.

Their other dishes beside noodles are pretty good, too; such as BBQ pork and chicken.
However, I would appreciate if they improve their services."}
{"text":"First time come here. The taste is good. I try the rice with BBQ duck. The bowl is suite for a woman except you are really hungry then choice the dish-a little bit greasy~Cheaper then you thought."}
{"text":"A friend raved that this is her favourite restaurant in Chinatown, so i was looking forward to trying this place out.
It's a mid sized restaurant and there were a decent amount of diners there, but we were able to get seated immediately even though we were in total 6 people.
The restaurant was cleaned.   It's not a fancy place but one where you expect no frills and delicious authentic Chinese food.  I ordered wonton bbq duck soup noodles for just under $11.  The order came quickly.  It was decent sized soup noodles.  What was surprising was that the wontons were nice and big!!!!  The flavour of the soup was a bit bland.  I had to add extra pepper and a bit of chilli to give it a kick.
We paid individually and tips were already added into the total.  Not that the service was bad, but i really wish they left the tips to us to decide."}
{"text":"This place is (apparently) the best and specializes in Chinese bbq goodies. This place was our last stop before leaving Toronto. We were pretty much the only person there but not long after we've arrived, people started coming in. I had the wonton, bbq duck with egg noodle. I enjoyed it! It was super flavourful and piping hot. The egg noodles and the duck were my favourite! The broth was seasoned just well enough so that it would let the main player shine. BBQ DUCK. I wished my drive back to Montreal wasn't so long because I would of ordered 4-5 whole ducks to take home! The prices here are very good and our waitress was really sweet!"}
{"text":"The best congee and BBQ pork and duck in Chinatown!  Only thing is, you should expect to wait in line for a bit during peak lunch and dinner hours.  Service is not the friendliest, but very fast and efficient."}
{"text":"Before I go into detail, I actually give King's a 3.5/5.

Sandra T was in town so she invited my family out to King's for dinner with her family. We arrived around 6:30ish and the restaurant was already busy...and it was a Tuesday night! Halfway through our meal, the place was rammed and we even had a random person eat at our table because there wasn't enough room...kinda weird.

My family all ordered the noodle soup with the wontons and BBQ duck thinking that we could finish it. We also had the rice noodle shrimp rolls which tastes the same as every other dim sum restaurant. When our noodle soup came out, we totally regret ordering our own bowls. Let's just say that the three of us could've shared one bowl. However, it was delicious!

Would I go here again? Possibly...I just think it's the same as every other Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"Awful customer service. Two out of the three Chinese staffs that helped us were pissy when we placed our order and asked to order more. Other than that, the noodles and wonton with roasted duck and pork were delicious. My boyfriend ordered a beer. The glass was greasy. Cash only. Will not be back."}
