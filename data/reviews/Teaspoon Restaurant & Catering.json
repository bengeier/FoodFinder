{"text":"Been there a few times now ! Food has always been fresh and in a satisfying amount (if your hungry this is where you should go) service is very good , quite family friendly environment and open pretty much everyday ! If you enjoy some persian food and some tea, go there today and check it out !"}
{"text":"Happened to pop into this place after lunch time... Such a good find as I let my nose lead me to the amazing smells coming from this place... my growling tummy was intrigued!    I had a half order of the Meatballs with green beans and saffron rice with fresh salad on the side to go, and I demolished it in my car... tasted like you were at someones house and they had just invited you for Family dinner.  Very Tasty, and the service is lovely!  Will be back to try dinner for sure"}
{"text":"Love the food at Teaspoon. It's delicious and well priced. The tea is killer as well."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant, but sadly, was forced to close due to problems with the building owners. Check out their website for the whole story and see how poorly the Teaspoon was treated.  Thanks Ali for the great food. You will be missed!"}
{"text":"Tonight I had a Barg and it was very authentic. Of course it was too much for me considering the dish size that they usually serve. For this range of price, you get something really extraordinary. I would come back for sure."}
{"text":"The most expensive Persian restaurant I've ever been! Such a small place, fast food design and slow service."}
{"text":"Had my first order since it's close by and I always have enjoyed the food I've tried from the region. We had some mixed kebabs which were cooked perfectly along with rice, grilled tomato and onions. There weren't any sauces to indulge in if that is what you are looking for so it made it a lighter meal. We also had a Greek salad which was a bit generic but it was still good. The pastry desserts we tried had a unique taste to them as if there was liquorice in it. It was a good dinner for the price and I think I will be exploring more of the menu."}
{"text":"I tried the 3 other main Persian restaurants in calgary and in my opinion teaspoon is the best. The meat is tender and well seasoned. I like the half rice /half salad option. And the owners were very friendly. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Expert in lamb shack as well as tahchin. Their salad is so good and different from other restaurants. Kababs and chicken rices are fresh and tender. Strongly recommended."}
{"text":"We had 2 entrees and an appetizer and everything was so delicious and flavourful. There was one thing in particular I'd recommend, but I don't remember the name but it was a garlic, tomato, eggplant dip. Also great service.  We will visit again for sure."}
{"text":"The kababs( both chicken and koobideh) were so tough as if they were cooked in a microwave. No grill marks on them! Their borani was the weirdest tasting borani I have ever had. Service was ok but food was awful!"}
{"text":"I love Persian food. One of my best friends in Vancouver use to make Persian food for me when I lived there. She said the best Persian is made at home because its so time consuming to make and most people don't have the patience  or will take short-cuts. I like to think she would be happy I found Teaspoon.  The food is so homey and comforting. The flavours are delicate and such a different flavour profile. The prices are inexpensive and anyone who thinks otherwise ... well.. let's just say I strongly disagree with them.   The lamb was lovely and such a huge portion. Do try the desserts. They have about 5 options and the price ranges from $2 to $5. For our meal and dessert, we paid $36. I had a huge lunch the next day and I thought it tasted even better than the night before."}
{"text":"Teaspoon is a tiny Persian restaurant located in a small strip mall in the Glengarry neighbourhood of SW Calgary. Teaspoon specializes in stews and kebabs made with traditional Persian flavours.  On my first visit to Teaspoon, I ordered several dishes for takeout as I wanted to try a variety of items from the menu.   The fesenjon (pomegranate and walnut stew with meatballs) was rich with a great walnut taste, but a bit too oily. The ghaymeh (split pea and beef stew) was lighter and came with a potato chip fries and pomegranate for an interesting garnish combination. My favourite dish was the eggplant dip with a deep herby flavour.  On the side, the saffron rice is standard as is the mix for the salad. However, the default dressing for the salad is a fresh lemon-y variety that seem to be made in house.  Overall, great off-the-beaten-path spot for something different!"}
{"text":"It's a very warm and cosy place with delicious food. I had Kabab there and it was very good. Dough was awesome, I recommend to have Bourani as well cause it's really tasty."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon a great authentic Persian place to eat.  The food was fantastic and very fresh.  We definitely will return"}
{"text":"I have taken away food from teaspoon few times but never had a chance to dine in. I have taken away stews ( like ghorme sabzi and fesenjoon) as well as their famous loobia polo and also tried their kebabs. What I can say is that the customer service is great, they are really friendly and accommodating. Food in general is good, lots of variety; Kebabs however need improvement; I did not really like the Barg. Koobideh was better but I like Koobideh from other Persian restaurants better. However, their Stews and Loobia Polo were tasty. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Positive points: - The prices are very affordable. - You can get half portions for those with a small appetite and even cheaper. - Fairly good menu items variety   Things they could do to improve: - Who would close an Iranian restaurant on Sundays?! That's the day most families go for Kabab or other traditional food. Close on Mondays like every other restaurant..! - The food quality has room to improve, and can be a bit less greasy.  I would go back and hope to increase to 4 or 5 stars next time  :)"}
