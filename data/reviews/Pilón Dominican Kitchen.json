{"text":"Great Dominican food!!! Came here yesterday for the first time. I had the Chicharron De Pollo and the Oxtails. The food was absolutely delicious. The Red beans and rice was excellent. The Sancocho soup; unforgettable, the taste was like back home in NY on Amsterdam Ave. Also tried the Pastelitos w/ (Chicken and Beef). Freshly prepared and made to order. A must go to establishment. You will not be disappointed at all. Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Delicious authentic food.  So glad there is something different in this area.  The environment they have created is also fun, simple and clean.  Everyone there was extremely nice and helpful.  Go get some authentic Dominican food!"}
{"text":"Very welcoming environment. Employers were very friendly. They even let me try some samples before actually deciding. This is a true authentic Dominican styled restaurant. Don't let the outside fool you. Inside is clean and modern with pop of colors! Must try! Will be coming back."}
{"text":"The pork Mofongo with pork was seasoned wonderfully with the perfect amount of salt. Three stars only because my palate craved more diversity of flavors and textures. A lettuce bed, crushed chips, avocado & tomato would do wonders in my opinion.  I also like spicy.
The atmosphere was welcoming, quaint and cool. The owners take pride in their business and it shows in their personal attention to the customer. 
Still curious about their others options."}
{"text":"Check this place out. Not a whole lot of variety around the area but this was a really nice find. The place looks nice inside, very clean and a modern look. The food prices are very reasonable. Most of the choices are under $10. The chicken stew is really good. If you want to try one of the items before you buy, they'll give you a sample as well. They're really nice and friendly there."}
{"text":"Yum!  We sampled a bit of everything and my favorites are the pulled pork and the rotisserie chicken!  Delicious!"}
{"text":"Authentic Dominican food at its finest! This is actually my second time eating from here and it definitely won't be my last. So far I've had the pernil (roast pork) and today I had the pollo frito (fried chicken). Their rice and peas are perfectly made and they have all traditional Dominican dishes with daily specials available. Let me add that the customer service is superb! They are patient, knowledgeable, their service is fast and with a smile. Pricewise its also great. I'm glad that I found this restaurant. Check them out...it's totally worth it."}
{"text":"Great food, location was a bit sketchy (parking lot could use some cleaning).  Generous portions but a limited offering with stewed chicken, beef, and roasted chicken.  I had the stewed chicken over rice with red beans which was very tasty, great home cooking Dominican style. The only veggie offering was what appeared to be frozen mixed vegetables, not a side that really went with the Dominican theme.  Plan on spending about 10 bucks a plate without drink."}
{"text":"Mofongo Mondays! Awesome authentic plantain dish cooked to perfection and the special on Mondays. Goes great with the fried chicken and a Dominican soda. 
Staff was super friendly and helpful, they even brought out samples of other dishes for me to try. The beef stew was delicious. Can't wait to try it with black beans and rice. Looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"OMG! Being from NY finding good Dominican food is super hard here. This place has delicious food!! The Chicharrón de Pollo are well seasoned and the chicken is super tender, I got the tostones which were a bit soggy because of the steam from the to go container. I also got a small portion of fried cheese which was a generous portion and just perfection. The staff was friendly and even gave me a taste of some bread pudding, which was very delicious. I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"This place was great.  Definitely going back. The food was amazing,  and the owners were attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"Update 2/2018- Quite bummed to find this place is currently padlocked with a notice to not trespass by Caburras County Sheriff. A contact number for the Landlord is on the notice. Windows are covered but when you peek in from glass door it looks cluttered and disorganized. Such great people that ran this little place and food was so good. Hope they are okay. 


*****
Decided to take the scenic back roads from Mint Hill to this place. I am not familiar with this area at all but Pilón is worth the drive to this side of town. 

You might miss it if you are not paying attention. In the lot next to Dollar General. 

Upon entering, you get the Dominican vibe- delicious flirtatious aromas of rotisserie chicken, rice, and beans, a pop of Caribbean colors, wood benches and tables, a large flat screen playing latin videos, and blown up sized photos of mouth watering Dominican dishes. 

A cozy mom and pop joint that can accommodate small to large groups. A menu that is extensive enough to serve favorite well known dishes that are hard to find like Mofongo. Prices that make your wallet sing its gratitude. Owners are engaging and eager to serve their customers.

Get in line and place your order to dine-in or to go. Only two people handling the serving and cooking so expect to wait just a little bit to be served. 

We had the yellow rice, red beans, rotisserie chicken, beef pastelitos, and sweet plantains. A pepsi fountain drink and bottle of a Dominican cream soda. Everything was delicious. Took a large order home for late dinner. 

My kids will be begging to go here every weekend now...and despite being keto, I will cave in every time. There goes my 2018 summer body goals. 

A great new addition to NC's growing latin restaurant scene."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a new place to eat in Concord and happened to drive past this gem. The food here is delicious! The people are friendly and the prices are reasonable as well. I played it safe and got the rotisserie chicken (still amazing), but I'll definitely be back to try more."}
{"text":"Hallelujah! What a relief to find some good Latin food in NC! So far I've only seen Mexican restaurants which aren't bad, but variety is everything! 

 Aside from the few positive reviews I had a good feeling about this place the moment we walked in, although it was a bit warm I'm hoping they were having temporary air conditioning issues. They were very friendly and even allowed us to sample some of their food. The food looks spectacular and taste even better! Their portions are very generous as most Latin places are and the prices are very reasonable. 

I ordered the \"CARNE DE RES GUISADO\"
(Stewed beef with white rice and red beans and plantains) it was Delicious!!

She ordered the Chicken Gizzards with rice and beard and she loved it! The food was fresh and authentic! I will definitely return! 

PS try the Dominican soda, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Great Dominican food. Reminds me of the Dominican spots in New York! Your going to leave full!"}
{"text":"Seriously LOVED this place! Everyone who works here is so nice and they make you feel at home. The great service is matched by it's amazing food. We will definitely be coming back here."}
{"text":"Today they had a traditional Puerto Rican meal as their special. The roast pork, rice w/pigeon peas, and yuca w/onions took us back to the island. You definitely need to check this place out!"}
{"text":"Love it, love it, love it!  Forget those \"other\" over-priced chicken chains!  Come check out Pilon for amazing food and wonderful service.  We came here because of other great yelp reviews and we were not disappointed!  If you walk in a little clue-less like us as to what to order the staff is super friendly and helpful.  They are very proud of the food they prepare and they should be!  I eat A LOT of chicken and this was top notch! The chicken was super juicy and flavorful.  Really nicely seasoned.  We had the mixed veggies and fried plantains as our sides, really yummy!  And they give you a large portion of food for not a lot of $.  Also the dining area is decorated super cute with lots of bright colors. This is now on our list of regular spots we visit for great food.  I highly recommend you check it out.  They will take care of you and you will leave with a happy tummy!"}
