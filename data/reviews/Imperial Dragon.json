{"text":"They have plenty of tofu & vegetarian choices. DO NOTE: You MUST be VERY clear with each item you order that this MUST NOT CONTAIN MEAT.  The order takers are not skilled enough to know that when you say this entire order is vegetarian....that this includes the fried rice, egg roll, etc... This is not a language barrier issue (most speak very clear English, just not knowledgeable in what vegetarian means, as stated by the manager.) You can easily swap out a spring roll for the egg roll in your combo meal, but again, you must specify that the spring roll is INSTEAD OF the egg roll. Otherwise you will end up with a spring roll in addition to a meat filled egg roll. Then also being charged for an extra spring roll. If you can get past the ordering issues, it's actually pretty darn good. Just too pricey to have them NOT get it right. So be very, very clear even if you think it's overkill. I know this from experience."}
{"text":"The service is good, but the food is so terrible, disgusting! I mean. Our firm likes to provide employees with lunch now and then, and I have to tell them each time that is is no way Chinese food, it is garbage. Not just he looking but the flavor. I don't know how they put together some random food, it is the second worst food I ever had in the US. Terrible!"}
{"text":"Order takeout for 7 people, we ordered the family dinner for 5 people, that was more than plenty! The wonton soup and chicken fried rice is my favorite! Everyone else loved their dishes( sweet and sour chicken, chicken lo mien and shrimp with lobster sauce). They deliver but they use an outside company."}
{"text":"A restaurant welll past its prime. We went into an almost empty restaurant,  waited more than 5 minutes, during  which time no one acknowledged us,  got up and left.  In the past few years the service went from ok to terrible.  I think we're done bothering to even try."}
{"text":"A staple in Mentor. The only Chinese restaurant in the area that we consistently get fresh, delicious food. Love the gyozas and spicy garlic noodles w/ pork."}
{"text":"i've been going here for about 10 years.  they have the BEST cashew chicken that i've ever had.  i'm also a big fan of their egg rolls (perfectly crisp).  a great local favorite !"}
{"text":"Probably the best Asian cuisine I've had in a very long time.   I have a particular, yet constant craving for a dish called Chow Fun. It's hard enough to find somewhere that does it, to do it right is another thing.   I ordered their Imperial Dragon Special (ordered it spicy), and was amazed. I highly recommend this joint. The dish alone would keep me coming back for years.   If not for the strip-mall atmosphere, I would give it 5 stars."}
{"text":"Always awesome....That could be the end of my review however it is not. Richard Jue and company really know their stuff. When I call an order in its always right/spot on and full of spice, thats just the way I like it. The Chicken and Rice soup will scare away all that ails you. The Lo-mein is fantatsic and The war su gai is so worth the battle.  But let me tell you as someone who knows this SECRET...............It my friends is the late night menu! The Grand Reserve if you will that make this place such a gem . Get to know Richard is step 1. Stay after close for a Zombie is step 2 amd then just wait to see what he and the boys bring out of the kitchen. Everything from Rack of Lamb to Pot Roast , Pasta and meatballs. Fresh deli sandwiches . Indian food. Hamburgers , Steaks and mussels and clams . The list goes on and on.   Now make your way to the Dragon and EXPERIENCE this for yourself Sincerely  RD"}
{"text":"WARNING: be ready to eat A LOT of food when you dine here.  Yes, I'm talking a lot of food!  Why, you ask?  Because not only do you get a mountain of food with each order, the food is that good that you won't be able to stop until it's no longer humanly possible to put anything more in your mouth!  So let's start from the beginning.  The appetizers are all excellent, but my favorites are their soups.  The hot and sour is to die for, the wanton is mouth watering, and if you like seafood then you have to try the velvet seafood chowder - AMAZING.  As for the entrees, everything I've ever had here has been delicious so it's hard to single out one, or even a few, dishes.  BUT, I will say this - I will recommend any of the combination plates.  For no more than $11.00, you get an eggroll, choice of soup, your meal with rice, and dessert - TOTALLY WORTH IT (especially since you'll have enough leftovers for lunch/dinner the next day)!  So, as you can see, you won't be disappointed with what you get for your money.  Enjoy this wonderful Chinese comfort food in this comfy cozy little joint (and yes, I agree with everyone else when they say not to let the strip mall exterior fool you - DON'T!)"}
{"text":"My husband and I visited the Imperial Dragon and had a poor meal. We we were very surprized at the service ,cleanliness and attention to. Dishes on the tables , water glasses empty...we waited a long time for the check. Pd ourbillwhen we got home my husband checkedour ba,k account for another reason and found they charged us with a $ 30.00 tip !! When my husband called the owner refused to give us our credit n my husband had to go back rest.toget our money he told my husband it's your handwriting !! He said really a $30.00tip ,a $ 23.0 Bill???? When he got to the rest. The mngr was unavail. The cashier pulled the Bill and showed him it was very legible at $3.00. He was refunded our money n we will never ho back again...and haven't ..servicefoid and cleanlinessis down hill sloppy ..carpet torn very un-kempt ...pick another Chinese rest.to eat at ..."}
{"text":"It's a OK place the won ton soup is good and it prices are not bad. I would give it 3 1/2 if you could give them.It's not a 4 stars because I have been to better but it is good"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in the area.  The food is great, and for the most part the service is great.  There are times when the help from the back will come out and start conversing with the owner.  The only issue is they start talking really loud.  Also it would be nice if the owner would help the wait staff a bit as there have been times when the place is ally busy, but he is just standing around doing nothing.  The food is fantastic though."}
{"text":"Still the best Chinese in Lake County In my opinion.  Standard American Chinese done right, everything is always fresh. Large portions and the best duck sauce or whatever that orange sauce is called!  Ask for the hot oil if you like it spicy, really good."}
{"text":"Stopped for dinner after work today. I had sweet and sour chicken, boyfriend had cashew chicken. Portions are generous. Everything tasted great. Restaurant server was nice and works quickly. Dinner was $26 including tip for both of us."}
{"text":"I drive from the East Coast to the Midwest about 4x a year, on I90, and I always stop in Mentor, OH. The first time, I discovered Imperial Dragon by happy happenstance, as I was jonesing for Chinese food. Now I ALWAYS make sure to leave my home in Boston early enough to get to Imperial Dragon before it closes! (10:30 PM)  As others have said, the strip mall exterior is a disguise for the excellent food inside. The entrees are good, but my favorite is the hot & sour soup, which comes with scallions and hot peppers and is absolutely delicious.  The hostess told me every time one customer comes to Cleveland from NYC on business, she orders a month's supply of egg rolls, frozen, and takes them home with her.  It's that good."}
{"text":"I come here every now and then and have always had a hot, fresh, and tasty meal. I like both the regular egg rolls and their spring rolls too. I love their teriyaki steak on a stick which I always get. I'm a fan of several Chinese restaurants all over the area so I keep this one for a dine in experience rather than take out. It has a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"My wife and I were long time & loyal customers until our last visit.  Service was slow and rude, while the food was cold and flavorless......we're looking for a new ( and better) Chinese restaurant......any suggestions?"}
{"text":"Went here with the family on my sister's recommendation and had a wonderful experience. We started with the pot stickers and crab rangoon. Both were incredibly good, and I was particularly pleased with how fresh the ingredients were. The texture and flavor were just superb.  Most of our party ordered sesame chicken. It was clearly fresh cuts of chicken, with no fat and amazing texture. Again, fresh is apparent and the seasoning very good.  I ordered the Mongolian beef, and it was easily one of the best examples of it I've ever had. Again, FRESH and flavorful.  The service was prompt, and the waitress was particularly attentive to and indulgent of my 1 year old son. She brought him a cookie, doted on him, all while bringing out superb food and keeping our glasses full.  We will definitely return."}
{"text":"The food here is only a bit above average and the portions are generous, but what makes me want to go back is the service!  It was 9:20 pm on a Thursday night.  (On Thursday's they're open until 10:30.)  We were seated right away and our server came over immediately to take our drink orders and give us menus.  Our food came quickly and was fresh and yummy!  She was very pleasant and helpful, as it was our first time here.  I would definitely go here again."}
{"text":"Food is very good, but a little high for Chinese food.  Service was fast.  I had the beef and asparagus.  Tasted good....beef, asparagus, carrots and water chestnuts in a brown sauce.  I ordered it as a combo with soup, egg roll, fried rice, and ice cream.  My friend had sweet and sour chicken.  Both meals were plentiful and delicious.  My friend's comment that the menu explains exactly what was in each dish.  A big plus!"}
{"text":"Brought home over $60 of a variety of food for the family.  Received the food timely, however, my 4-year old summed it up when she said it tasted like a band-aid."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food I have eaten in a long time. Friendly staff, great ambiance, and reasonable prices. You have to try to General Tso's chicken and the Beef Chow Fun - to die for! Thank you for providing the Cleveland area with great Chinese food!"}
{"text":"I have never had a bad meal here.  Fast service, always a good experience.    I can't say enough good things about this restaurant and the food.  Hunan chicken is my all time favorite, but the triple delight is wonderful as well.  I always get mine extra spicy, they never over do it though, it's always perfect.    Wonton soup is great, as are the egg rolls.  The food comes out super hot, but I can never wait long enough for it to cool down.  Huge portions for a good price.  You'll find yourself craving it a lot."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday. Sat down right away. Food was good and it had huge portions. Indians game was on and service was really good.  I enjoyed it very much."}
{"text":"Service was awful, waitress came by once then brought food and then we waited for a check for 15 mi s . Additionally we could hear the waitress swearing as she walked by. The food wasn't terrible but we won't be back. I had chicken lo mein and the noodles tasted like they were just instant ramen noodles from the supermarket."}
{"text":"Order here few times a year. It is close we notice it is hit or miss last couple of times and the food is changing. Still a great option if your in the area. I just think it is time they update their food and not be so much about quantity and go back to quality.  But we will be back as the choices in lake county are slim."}
{"text":"Total comfort food!  Old school Chinese!  Hubby & I sat at the bar...we were served our drinks immediately.  Richard, the owner, made us feel right at home:  he'd provided a tray of cheese & crackers for everyone to help themselves.  We ordered the pu pu platter for two--we were stuffed for $8 a piece!!!  The platter materialized quickly & all items hot.  The golden fingers & shrimp were crispy, steak skewers tender, ribs delectable.  The egg rolls were perfect, too.  I also couldn't resist getting the shrimp toast: golden, crunchy, delish!  A shout out to Sharon who tends bar.  She's got a smile that lights up a room & also made us feel welcome.  We'll be happy to patronize this Mentor gem again!"}
{"text":"This place is OK.  Nothing special really.  They have a decent dining room for a Chinese place.  There are better options in Mentor."}
{"text":"We ended up here after getting our hound dog chipped. Mentor has so many fast food places and we wanted Chinese, so we went out of our way.   We started with the pu pu platter which was on the menu for $8. What a bargain! Until we realized it was $8 per person. Admittedly the waitress asked \"for 2?\" when I ordered, but I do not remember seeing that noted on the menu.  On the other hand, after the gigantic and worth-the-money pu pu platter, we didn't have much room left for supper. I ordered either the Orange or Empress Chicken. (Sorry I don't remember.) Upon eating the leftovers however, the whole thing was a little too sweet. The server was attentive and polite without being annoying.   So now you're wondering \"Ok lady, so why 2 stars?\" The manager on duty.   I have no idea if this is the owner, but he acted like it. He directed the floor staff to do some stuff, no surprise, but as someone who's been in foodservice far too long, I know that tone. It's the tone of an arsehole. Overbearing. Very snippy. You can tell he thinks everyone under him is an idiot. I could just visualize this guy chewing people out in public- oh wait, I don't need to visualize, I got a glimpse of it.   While we were waiting for our food, the manager told the waitstaff that there would be a large party (10-12 people) coming through in a few minutes. He told Servers X and Y. Server X was our server, who had 3 or 4 other tables. So here comes this huge party and Server Y went over and greeted them and they both handled their beverages. They weren't there long and they were ready to order. So Server Y started taking the order and Server X was trying to attend to her tables so she could get to this big party. (Server Y had none that I observed.) So Mr. Manager comes over and sees this and said, \"Server X, why is Server Y taking the order all by herself? Is there a problem?!\" I'm telling you, I know this tone and this is the tone of a Chef Ramsey-esque jerk.   Let me put this in perspective, since not everyone has the jinx of working in foodservice. Have you ever had a boss that treated you like crap? That chewed you out in front of your co-workers? A micro-manager? When you looked at the schedule and you saw you worked with Mr. Manager that day, did you cringe? Yeah I thought so. This is that guy. Would you ever want to give Mr. Manager any of your money again? Hell no.   And that's why this place got 2 stars, and it's also why we won't be going back.   If you're going to treat your people like sh*t do it in the office where the customers can't see it."}
{"text":"Don't let the creepy strip mall thing fool you. Imperial Dragon is really good.   Their soups = hot love in a bowl. Seriously.   Always great service. Friendly and very attentive. You never have to ask for a refill on anything.   Many options for vegetarians and other diet restrictions.   If you feel like drinking there's a full bar.   Imperial Dragon is completely worth the drive into the Ninth Circle of Hell that is Mentor, Ohio. (I know, it's only the 100th time I've referred to Mentor in that way).  I cannot find good Chinese food anywhere near my house.... so Mentor/Ninth Circle it is!"}
{"text":"Sadly this restaurant USED TO have good food. Twice now I have gone since I moved back to mentor and both times it was \"MEH....\"  EVERYTHING was bland and tasteless even the sweet and sour chicken. But this time at least they got my order right. Everyone is hurting for money and looking for shortcuts buying cheaper ingredients shrinking portions and raising prices but at this rate we will be paying top dollar for vending machine quality food served off paper plates that probably have more and better flavor. Cooked by shoe salesman and served by those little robots that vacuum your floors. I MIGHT give them 1 more chance. But I doubt it.  Food definitely NOT worth the price."}
{"text":"I used to enjoy the food here, but it has gone downhill.  I ordered the chicken fried rice for lunch on 2/23, and it was disgusting.  Too much soya sauce, tofu instead of chicken, and I think I found one bean sprout.  Nasty stuff.  I tossed it out, it was even hard to look at.  Never again."}
{"text":"What happened?  This place used to be so good!  I have noticed the customer base has dropped off.  The parking lot always seems so empty.  But nevertheless, we ordered carry out last week.  The price they quoted over the phone was $16 higher than it should have been.  So, they fixed it because I noticed the overcharge.  After eating our kung pao and General tso chicken, we both became sick within about an hour.  That food went through us like a bullet train.  Used to be a great place.  Sorry to see it come to this.  I cannot go back....I'm sorry."}
{"text":"I read a few recent reviews on here that relayed a similar experience I had at this restaurant about a year ago. I've been coming to imperial dragon since it opened back in the day. For the most part, I do like the food, but the last time I dined inside I was a little put off by one of the male managers or owner. A newly hired waitress (who was foreign) was struggling with service, menu items, and billing. She was a sweet woman and was trying her best to pick up the job. Although our table was patient with her, she had a small mix up with a table next to us. She accidentally charged this table for combination meals when they supposedly didn't specifically order them. Keep in mind, they were served these combos and happily ate everything she brought (won ton soup, egg rolls, main dish, and ice cream). Then they made a big surprised fuss when the bill came and they were charged for what they ate. They were very rude to this poor waitress and made her fix the mistake on the bill. Anyway, the waitress consulted with the manager/owner who persisted to berate & belittle this woman loudly in front of all the restaurant patrons. It was very tacky. No one deserves to be treated that way and especially not in front of clientele. The whole incident left a sour feeling about the place for me. That, and in the summer it's always very cold inside. I may still get take out but am hesitant to dine in. Food is good, but two stars due to the overall experience."}
{"text":"Dining in is fine but I work in the area and we have tried to get delivery. They use an outside company to deliver and the company will not deliver if the order is not over 50 dollars. That's crazy that somebody must order 50 bucks of food for a company who takes over an hour to deliver it."}
{"text":"This place always has great food. I have loved coming to this place for years. Reason for my 4 star rating and not 5 was the service I received on New Years Eve. Granted they were a lot busier than normal because of the holiday. But that is no excuse for poor service and the waitress acting like we were inconveniencing her. All of our food came out together except one and everyone else ended up finishing dinner before that one ever came out. We complained but the server argued with us about it saying its not their fault that they are very busy and that's why it didn't come out on time. When does a restaurant being busy become a customers fault? Then we asked to not pay for that one dish. The server said she would speak to the manager and we saw her just go back and stand by the drink station for one minute and not speak to anyone. She then came back and said all they could do is take half off. In the end it was not about the money at all, I would have gladly paid for that one dish. It's about the service and the fact that they tried to make excuses for their horrible service. Oh and they were trying to rush everyone in and out because they had people waiting out of the door. This could just be one bad employee but it reflects poorly on this restaurant."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of those situations where the quantity and quality of food completely dominate the service, therefore making it tolerable enough to keep coming back for more.   Strip mall-flip mall--this place is delish! Yea, it's got that tacky decor. But are you really there to critique their fashion design skills? No. You're there to conquer a huge combination plate for $11 starting with their wonton soup, some chicken chow mein with fried rice and an egg roll and a finishing it all with a double scoop of sherbet, right? Yes.  All sorts of yes.   Now, don't get me wrong. You'll be seated pretty quickly here and get prompt service. But let me tell you, it will be prompt, no-bullshit service. The last time we were there I almost died laughing at the way the waitress was talking to my sister. She actually interrupted her during her order for steamed rice and told her, \"No! You want fried rice!\". Then I tried to order just a wonton soup and a glass of red wine for the time being. Wow... it was like I wasn't allowed to keep my menu just in case I wanted more.   Honestly, though--the rudeness isn't offensive. It's actually a little funny! And it's not like that all the time. I think out of the many times I've been here, only a handful have included rude service. And with food as cheap and as tasty as that, you really don't think about anything else. Seriously."}
{"text":"I took my family to Imperial Dragon for lunch on a Saturday afternoon. The place was almost empty, which surprised me given the great reviews I saw on Yelp.   We were seated quickly by a surly hostess. Fortunately, the waitress was friendly and helpful. This being our first time here, we ordered a pu pu platter offering various meats plus some pork fried rice and chicken chow mein. Sadly, most of the food tasted the same, all liberally seasoned with allspice. Even the fried rice had that faintly cinnamony flavor. The only exception was the gold fingers (chicken strips) in the platter, which were bland. It wasn't a horrible meal, but I expected better based on previous reviews.  A whopper of a headache later that day made me wonder how much MSG the restaurant uses. I'll be looking for other options for Chinese food around Mentor before I try Imperial Dragon again."}
{"text":"Great food with nice-sized portions. This restaurant has consistently friendly service, too. I have only ever eaten in but would be willing to try their take out, too."}
{"text":"The food is always fantastic and fresh! When we want good, fast Chinese food,  it's THE ONLY place we go!"}
{"text":"The food here is excellent quality... pleasant quiet atmosphere. Service extremely quick. A bit on the pricy side for Chinese but well worth it...my kids also love it!"}
{"text":"Last few times we order take out .They left some food orders out.We call and they add us to missing food items list.So couple weeks go by and we order agin.But this time we want our missing food from their list.Of course they can't find our  name on list .All I can say I will not be back and check your orders before you leave"}
{"text":"Imperial Dragon is by far the best Chinese food in the area. Their prices are very reasonable and the quality of the food is excellent."}
{"text":"I love there Sweet and Sour Chicken.  Not a bad spot to get some good food in Mentor."}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming to Imperial Dragon for years. About 3 weeks ago I ordered takeout around $70 worth. I know different cooks sometimes cook differently but the items I ordered were definitely inconsistent from what I've had before. My 3 complaints: fried rice tasted burnt, my green beans were really mushy, and the wonton soup only had the wanton and broth with a few green onions and that was it. Whenever we dine in theres always cabbage/greens and is so yummy! Still my #1 favorite chinese restaurant, just disappointed with that takeout experience. Thanks"}
{"text":"Came late on a Saturday night. It wasn't very busy, but they put us next to the bar anyway and having a conversation was a bit hard, given the at times lewd shouting behind us.  The booth was a bit slimy/greasy, the waitress was prompt and attentive, she was quite nice. Our water was always full.  The crab ragoons were good as always. The egg rolls were alright too.  The vegetable lomein was pretty bad. Flavorless. The Buddhist delight was meh, the veggies were okay but there was something very soggy about the tofu, very water logged. Also got the general tso's chicken. Very large pieces, it was okay.  The lomein and the vegetarian dish seemed to be coated in a weird gelatin.  And the tea they brought out was some heavily steeped black tea- not very good.   I gave two stars on the basis of the good service and the appetizers. But I don't think I plan to return."}
{"text":"excellent food and service! first time here and one of the area's best in the east side. we dined in and had a few drinks before dinner! Richard was very nice and turns out he was the owner as well. prices are fair compared to other Chinese places however the portions here are very large in size compared to most other places, more bang for your buck yet excellent dining expierence we will definitely be here again!"}
{"text":"I'm still a fan, but... Last night we got the Family Dinner for 2, to go. I was very annoyed they charged me $4 extra to get beef fried rice, rather than pork! WTH! For years I've been getting that and have only paid $1.50 extra, which is the difference between the price of a pint of pork fried rice and the beef, a-la cart, even though the portion for 2 is smaller than the pint. But I'm OK with that. So, they have raised their price. Now, the difference is $2 between pork and beef. Why am I paying $4???! That's total BS!"}
{"text":"I always try to make a trip here when in Mentor. They have the best wonton soup and orange chicken I've ever eaten. The general tao's is also excellent. The prices are very reasonable for quantity served."}
{"text":"You can see from my past review I've always liked it here. I think I try and be fair with any negatives b/c I realize people are trying to make a living. That being said, in 2017 with so many options available to the customer, I find it unforgivable when menu items don't accommodate people with diet restrictions. The combo plates here are not available with veggie fried rice. They try and up sell you, saying they can't make that small of an amount. No other Chinese place I've ever been to has had this issue, especially when I'm buying like $50 worth of food. And when I asked to speak to a manager, I was told no one was available. You lost a customer."}
{"text":"Growing up, dining out at Chinese restaurants was a common practice in our household. Having tried a variety of places, I have to say, I was Very pleased with this one. I ordered hot tea to start & it was very tasty (not a lot of sugar necessary) & the General Tsos Combination Platter. My wonton soup was delicious: not salty, 3 beautiful wontons, accompanied by some slices of pork & green onion. The chicken platter was the best I have had in a long time. The vegetables were nice & crisp, cooked just enough, the fried rice had the right amount of soy sauce & the chicken: the breading was crisp but not covering the meat so much that it was all you tasted. And the sauce: a little spicier would have been fine but the taste was authentic, as if it was homemade. My husband ordered the sweet & sour shrimp (but didn't share) but what I did taste of the sauce, I'll have to try it next time! We look forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"The food, drinks & atmosphere are terrific! The orange chicken was positively delicious!  We had the off the menu pork \"wild wings\".....heaven on Earth!!  The owner Richard provides a fun, relaxed & casual dining experience that compares to none other! You surely will not be disappointed in the Imperial Dragon!  Thank you!!"}
{"text":"I hate to do this because this has been the place that I compare every other Chinese place to. I've been getting the chicken fried rice from here for 12~ years. I ordered it again today.   I got home ten min later and my car seat was covered in oil. The bag bottom was drenched in oil. The container was styrofoam rather than the usual box. It had leaked oil everywhere. The rice tastes absolutely terrible and I had to throw 3/4 of it out.   I don't know what's happened here but it makes me upset. I won't give up on you just yet, but I threw away $7 today."}
{"text":"I'm not a Chinese fan, but Imperial Dragon is pretty good. I love the calamari! That's one of my favorite's. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"I had dinner there with my girlfriend the other day and as usual the food is good. They're nice big portions and the service is friendly. They get the food out to you quick and then come back often to see if you need drink refills. I will be back there to eat and if you have a taste for this kind of food you should try it also."}
{"text":"I truly enjoyed the food and at first the waitress had apparently had a bad day but she warmed up slowly and the meal ended on a positive note."}
{"text":"Yep this Chinese Restaurant is in a strip mall but the quality of the food is of a very good quality. The staff is friendly enough, the portions are large and the modern restaurant is big enough to cater to groups and families.  I highly recommend the lettuce wraps (vegetarian option has lots of mushroom morsels), crab rangoon or hot and sour soup for starters -- don't forget the shrimp chips too! Entrees always have a solid amount of veggies which is a must. Love the pepper steak, honey walnut shrimp and curry chicken. Of course there are fortune cookies for dessert too.  I wish that Imperial Dragon offered brown rice and some additional \"healthy\" Chinese food options. I may be a little old school, but I'm also a fan of the Chinese zodiac place mats - hey its always a little something to keep you busy, right? If you're placing an order for takeout be sure to check and make sure your orders are right.  There is a full bar at this Chinese restaurant and plasma TVs too. All in all a solid choice for Asian dining in the City of Choice (that's Mentor of course)."}
{"text":"Surprisingly Great Chinese food in the far eastern suburbs of Cleveland.  Lots of dishes you could only normally find in the authentic places in Asia Town, such as Chow Fun and Honey Walnut Shrimp.  On the particular Saturday night we visited, the place was very busy with both diners and take out orders, but once seated, the service was still attentive.  The food was excellent, the aforementioned Shrimp, and Thai Wings were a very nice treat, and the Sesame chicken was of mammoth proportions.  Despite the large portions, the prices were very fair. If you like Chinese food, and find yourself stranded in the Lake County wasteland, this is a welcome oasis."}
{"text":"Some of my family's old Chinese restaurant favorites have since closed (May Wah in Euclid and Chin's Pagoda in Willowick when it was good, like back in the 80s - still remember that old school red velvet wallpapered interior, it was divine), so I'm happy that Imperial Dragon is here. We are never disappointed dining in or getting takeout.   Day after Christmas was busy! We had sesame chicken, lo mein noodles and crab rangoon for appetizer. Portions are always huge. Chicken was moist. And they give you plenty of veggies and sauce.   They also serve the illusive War Sue Gai, which I've only found in the Cleveland area (seriously only people from like Ohio and Michigan seem to know what the heck I'm talking about), so I usually get that - I don't care if it's not authentic cuisine, it's good!  Also, there's a nice little bar area with TV if you don't want to sit in the main dining room, which is nice."}
{"text":"Friendly service. Well-done versions of the classic Chinese restaurant dishes. Crab rangoon can be a little greasy -- if you're eating in, make sure to flip the fried wonton over in case there's some hot oil hiding inside."}
{"text":"Very good food here and one of the best Chinese options in this area.  Great place for takeout but not for the atmosphere. I came in today around 3:15pm, so an odd time to dine in, and was one of only 3 people here.  The waitress seemed pretty annoyed with the fact I was here during what may normally be her break time and also cut me off while I was ordering when I was asking to upgrade soup for an extra charge.  I overheard the other tables making comments as well about her questionable service so maybe this employee was just having a bad day.  It is an odd location. It is in a strip mall and kind of dark so one of our guests was kind of weirded-out but also enjoyed the food.  Food came out very quickly as well!  Just don't take a date here and you'll be fine! :)"}
{"text":"over priced for deliver  i ordered two items and it came out to almost $30.00. delivery charge is $5.00 when usually its around $2.00. they also push an automatic $5.00 tip on you when you order.   do not order online - you will be paying $10 just for them to get it to you. also, more money for whatever price they make up.  stay away."}
