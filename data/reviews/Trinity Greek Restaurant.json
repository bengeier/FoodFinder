{"text":"BEAUTIFUL decor, exorbitant pricing for what amounts to good, but not amazing or creative, food."}
{"text":"Great Greek restaurant with a forte on the traditional Greek food. The mood is more upbeat on Thursday and Friday at the lounge.    A bit pricey, so be careful when you say yes to the server...  My recommendation is to share a full fish among the guests, this is the best approximation of my idea of a real meal at a Resto in Greece.  R."}
{"text":"Great food served by a wonderful staff!  Authentic greek food at its finest. Staff went out of there way to make sure my party of six was taken cared of. The food was outstanding as we tried ALL of the appetizers. As an entry please try the lamb as it is cooked to perfection. Great upbeat atmosphere and very reasonable prices. The establishment looks great and the crowd looks even better!"}
