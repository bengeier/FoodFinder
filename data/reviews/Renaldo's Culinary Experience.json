{"text":"First time eating at Renaldo's, we had the lobster Mac n cheese and the crab cakes.  Both were very tasty and well presented.  We also had fried kale which was plain awesome.  We will definitely going back soon and will be spreading the word about the good food and nice people."}
{"text":"I dropped in after hearing great things about this place on Gaston Eats and reviews from coworkers. The best way to describe this place is to take your typical Italian restaurant in a food court then polish it with a chef polish. I had the lobster Mac and cheese and topped it off with bacon. This was lovely and a good baked style Mac with solid portions of cheese and just the right amount of lobster. My son had the Mr 704, a meatball sub with waffle fries. The fries were crispy on the outside and perfectly soft inside. The sub was filled with tender meatballs and a red sauce with freshly grated off the block parmesan cheese on a fresh roll. The roll had just the right amount of tooth to hold up to the sauce without being bready or falling apart. We also had the Mac and cheese egg rolls as an appetizer. These are a signature here and worth getting. The Sriracha mayo adds just a little bit of kick to balance the cheese and crunch for a smooth finish.

For dessert, we tried a lemon sorbet piped and finished with toasted coconut that was light on the tongue and a refreshing finish after the heavy cheeses and lobster. We also tried a peanut butter chocolate mousse with a chocolate ganache and Oreo crumb bottom. This was also sublime, and definitely in the chef's wheelhouse.

It was a pleasure to meet the chef and watch him take the simple ingredients an tableware of a food court and make it gleam. This place is truly a culinary experience. Thank you Renaldo!"}
{"text":"I know this is going to sound odd coming from me, as I am one of those folks who simply detest going to the mall, but listen for a second.
In Gastonia, North Carolina, we have a mall in the center of town located on the corner of I-85 and New Hope Road. This mall has had its share of troubles and is losing stores faster than it can fill them. Even the food court is spotty as far as having vacancies. I'm not sure what inspired it,  but we also now have our Motor Vehicles tag office located in our Mall LOL!
All that said if you go in the main entrance of the mall you will come up the escalators and be standing next to this tag office, and to your right will be the food court area, and then you'll see this really shocking restaurant / food stand, for lack of a better terminology. Somehow we've been blessed enough for God to put \"Ronaldo's culinary experience\" in the middle of a food court in the middle of a crappy dying shopping mall.
This is honestly a four or five-star culinary experience. I'm going to upload some photographs, I hope you'll enjoy, but I don't need to sit here and tell you about this food because everything I've eaten there has been spot on delicious. Nothing else in any mall in America can compare to this, being just obnoxiously honest, there are only two or three places in this entire town I would put the same category in one of those is $30 for a ribeye. When I go there to eat, I feel like I should be sitting at a table with a nice white tablecloth and fancy folded napkins, maybe even with a tuxedo wearing server. I can't imagine for the life of me why anyone would go to the nasty Asian fusion place to the left of him with a 93 Health rating instead of walking up and letting Renaldo blow them away.
His pricing structure was a little higher than most of the other choices you have, but now they seem to have fallen in line.   I know for some reason, in my mind, I'm able to say I'm getting more food for my money quality-wise whereas other Mall goers and people who work there may have a need for it to be cheaper to justify them eating their. No I probably couldn't afford to go there every single day, but I would have a darn hard time trying not to go get two jobs in the mall just to be able to do so.
I'm going to upload photos of his Greek Pizza, Shrimp and grits, the best chicken wings in Gaston County, possibly that I've ever had, tiramisu sponge cake, macarons, Salmon part is, crab cakes, and every single thing I'm going to put a photo of is homemade right there from scratch. If you are traveling down I-85 in either direction you will have sorely missed out if you do not stop and go sit on the crappy tables in the middle of our mall and try Ronaldo's. If you live in Gastonia and you haven't been there, shame on you!"}
{"text":"We saw some other folks eating a gourmet pizza at the mall.  They said it came from the pizza place in the food court.  So we stopped by to try it.  The chicken bacon ranch pizza was really good. It reminds me of Brixxs pizza."}
{"text":"Great food, great variety, great service.  Worth a trip to the mall just to eat here.  Chicken Parmesan sandwich was fantastic.  Pizza really good too.  Super Friendly people."}
{"text":"WOW!! This is the best restaurant in Eastridge mall!  Big deal right?  What if I told you it's also one of the best restaurants in Gastonia?  Or better?  Renaldo's Culinary Experience is one of he best restaurants in Gaston County, and that is not hyperbole.  After reading and hearing so much about it, we decided to finally give it a try.  I am so glad we did.  The shrimp and grits are amazing.  I've had shrimp and grits that were half as good for twice the price.  After trying those we ordered the bang bang shrimp, the truffle butter grilled cheese, and a dessert platter.  Every dish was amazing and so much more than you would ever expect from this unsuspecting spot in the food court.  Do yourself a favor, and get here soon.  Support a local business that deserves to be supported!!  If you're looking for good food, you won't be disappointed with this special place and it's talented and charming owner!!"}
{"text":"The spin chips were awesome!  Fantastic service. Busiest restaurant in the food court!!!"}
{"text":"Today was our first time dining at Renaldo's. My son had been hearing great things about the restaurant so we decided to give it a try and we are so glad that we did. The menu had a good variety and we enjoyed all of our food. Try the shrimp and grits, which chef informed us he sells out of every day, it was fantastic!  The mall is not the typical location that you would find such great food so don't let that fool you and give it a try. 

Other great menu items were Lobster Mac & Cheese, Spaghetti & Meatballs, and Bang bang shrimp. All were excellent!!"}
{"text":"Best mall food you will EVER have!! We got three different items all delicious, the crab cakes, jerk chicken, shrimp and grits... WOW. What a hidden gem"}
{"text":"Food was made to order. I tried the crabby patty (crab cakes with a spring mixed salad, topped off with a seasoned corn dressing) the food was a tad bit spicy but the crab was very flavorful and the dressing was a new taste, so I enjoyed that. I also tried a slice of the cheese pizza. It was very fresh and the cheese and sauce tasted like actual new york style pizza. The chef was there and everyone was friendly.  Will be back again!"}
{"text":"I work in the mall and there is nothing good to eat here, except Renaldo's. The food isn't cheap but this guy can cook lol. So well infact, that I disregarded the woman at the front counter who has never smiled when I pick up my food and is very short with people. However, today has changed that. I ordered my usual, the lobster mac and cheese. When they presented it to me it was a fraction of the normal size. When I inquired about this he got rather irritated and when I offered to pay more for my usual size, he rolled his eyes and went to the back of the store without saying a word. Because of that, I decided I would eat elsewhere. I got a refund and left. No biggie right? WRONG! Lol apparently it offends him to the highest degree to give refunds. He followed me to my store and began shouting so loudly my customers all stopped to watch the show. He demanded my corporate office number and as I attempted to look it up (I never needed it before so I didn't have it on hand) he began shouting about unprofessionalism and asking for a refund in front customers. He would not cease yelling and at this point people stopped what they were doing and were staring. In order to maintain professionalism, I asked him to look up the corporate number and leave. Shortly after he left, I apologized to the remaining customers for the scene they witnessed. One of them stated \"Oh hun it's ok. He's my neighbor so I know all too well what he's like.\" I love the food here but because of the lack of customer service and him following me to my store for requesting a refund, unfortunately I will not be able to support this business."}
{"text":"This place will blow your mind. It's like a hidden gem because it's in the Gastonia Mall Food Court but the food tastes like it's a five star restaurant. They have a appetizer called the Mac & cheese egg roll with a sauce that'll have you going crazy. Everything is made fresh and seasoned to perfection. This place will really change your view about ordering food in a mall food court"}
