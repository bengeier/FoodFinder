{"text":"Oh my god can you say ghetto ghetto ghetto... Should have went with my first instinct when is saw the 4 obese security guards standing outside not doing a damn thing... The waitress was actually okay..but when my friend got her drink they forgot to put the liquor in it... The hookers are a turn off.. Dirty dirty dirty.. Then when they supposedly forgot the liquor in my friends drink a second time I was done.. I dont even understand why the radio advertises this place.. nasty.. Never would I go here again not even if it was the last club in the world..yuk.."}
{"text":"Such an undiscovered Jem. The Best hands down Bloody Mary and ceviche . Guy Ferrari needs to come down to check this place out!"}
{"text":"The ambiance is vibrant. The only thing I got dizzy from was the  flashing stars by my table. Staff was very friendly and attentive keeping my divaness calm. My friend and I ordered the Sampler Basket which was fantastic."}
{"text":"Nice lil spot to watch free fights get there early for cheaper food and the food is good"}
{"text":"I work near by and always wanted to try it. I heard of it before from various friends which they said it was ok so I decided to go. Worst decision the pool tables are only for the usual people that go. I literally was setting up the pool when this guys came up to me and said it was their table. I told the bartender and she ignored me completely. Very unprofessional and the service is inefficient. If your new they will treat you like crap. You can easily tell their preference. I went another time about 4 months later maybe it was day or something but same deal. I highly recommend to NOT go here."}
{"text":"On 4-12-2015 my soon to be wife and I, due to miscommunication and a true misunderstanding were not happy with our service. I wasn't not aware how unhappy my future wife was until she posted her feelings on yelp. Her feelings I understood for that moment but I write this review because in the process of getting this cleared up Krystal personally reached put to me and explained the situation. This has never been done for me. So to Arik Krystal and Roxy you have given me years of great service and I am grateful for all the memories. A 5 star review is not even enough. I will still continue to recommend your establishment to anyone and everyone."}
{"text":"The only good thing about this place is the waitress/bartender Francina and the bouncers.. so we payed for bottle service and they kept the bottle in the back the whole time. We had to pay an additional $2 to mix our drink with pineapple juice?? Where do they do that at? On top of that the bartender Crystal said \"fuck that\" when we try to order 3 additional mixed drinks on top of our bottle we paid for.. all because she was in a \"bad mood\"? Customer service is great but the MANAGEMENT is horrible. Sad because we were weekly guests at this bar and now we will never come here again.  LOST A VERY LOYAL CUSTOMER ALL BECAUSE OF THE MANAGER CRYSTAL OR KRYSTAL."}
{"text":"Been here twice. It's a neighborhood bar, which I'm a fan of. But in any business & for women, a clean decent restroom is VERY important. This was so disgusting  I can't step foot in ever again.  ."}
{"text":"Great place. Food is amazing and cooked fresh! He is client....but I bring clients here as well. Wait staff is amazing. People are Great! I really like it here! Erik is owner...give him a shout!!! He will take good care of you!"}
{"text":"By far some of the best food and service here in AZ. As a native born and raised here the food and the drinks are legit. Great atmosphere and awesome, affordable prices   Kids are welcome during the day too, Lemon Pepper wings grilled are Life!!!"}
{"text":"This place is the best - location is heavy industrial - food and service is AWESOME!  Don't miss it if you are down this way!  Fabulous $1 tacos on Tuesday."}
{"text":"If there was an option for NO STARS that would be my review. This place is very unsanitary. Employees are very rude and unprofessional. The place just has a dirty look to it. The time I went I waited 40 minutes for my food only to find a hair in it after complaining multiple time on how long they were taking. One time was enough at this place. I would NEVER step foot in there again if someone paid me."}
{"text":"We enjoy coming to 27th.  Roxy, Kristal and Arik are the best.  The drinks are extremely great!  I recommend anyone to come in and ask for the Roxy special.  Enjoy"}
{"text":"Came for the mayweather fight and had a good time.  The food was good, service was good, and it was cheap. Overall well done; even though the bar was full the service was still doing a fine job."}
{"text":"I can't believe I even set foot into this place. Gave it chance and thought it would turn out to be a charming little place but it certainly wasn't. Filthy tables, filthy bar, filthy pool tables and not to mention the filthy guys blatantly staring at you from the bar. Did stay long enough to try the food. Do so if you're brave."}
{"text":"OMG, the food is so delicious! The jalapeno poppers and shrimp are so good! Had a pina colada as well and just as great!"}
{"text":"Awesome Bar n grill very dive good jukebox good food good service pool tables good service I haven't had a bad experience yet nice and friendly crowd"}
{"text":"Best wings, coldest beers in town! Good atmosphere & awesome bartenders! Come check it out!"}
{"text":"Staff was friendly but the place itself could use some improvement it's more like a club than a bar and grill."}
{"text":"This is a great neighborhood bar and I see why everyone has given it so many stars. The bar has two pool tables, but the real appeal is the vast amount of Oakland Raiders memorabilia throughout the bar. The bartenders were polite, very nice, and asked if we needed new drinks when appropriate. It's a clean bar, the bathrooms are a little basic, but also very clean which is always a plus for a small bar."}
{"text":"Alittle hole in the wall place, but if you become a regular they treat you like family. One of my favorite hang out places. Always very clean :)"}
{"text":"It was a Thursday night my first time... Raiders vs KC I believe. I arrived early. All the tables were RSVP. I went to the bar to get a drink... It took about 10 minutes to get the bartenders attention. Staff is rude & the owner is a dick. What makes me say this? I'll tell you why! I tried having a conversation with him & asked him if he had ever gone To a Raiders game in Oakland or in Los Angeles! He became extremely paranoid & asked me if I was a Chargers or Niners fan! I was appauled by his reaction & his wannabe thug attitude considering I was wearing an LA cap! He became upset & walked away mumbling from the side of his neck.  I was there for the whole game. Only 1 bartender offered me a drink without calling her. The wings were alright. After the game the DJ arrived. The DJ is a really cool dude. I had met him before at another bar. Too bad he can't mix if his life depended on it! I will never give this establishment another dollar!"}
{"text":"So my girlfriends and have been here before multiple times. The drinks are great amazing prices. The music is on point for the atmosphere and crowd. Our table was clean and waitresses were friendly. Why only 4 stars?? Please for the love of god put a door on the women's bathroom n get rid of that curtain. I don't understand a door is so cheap. Otherwise great place."}
{"text":"Awesome environment great staff Really great food awesome food specials the also have $1 tacos on Tuesday and Thursday's they also get creative with there mix drinks will definitely be back"}
{"text":"The Best bar in the area! Tacos will make your grandma jealous. The coolest bartenders and owner! The burgers, salads and wings are excellent. I would give it a try if you have any sence at all!"}
{"text":"While visiting the beautiful city of Phoenix from my home of Chicago, this bar was definitely a memorable night for me! The place gets pretty packed pretty early; and it seems like most are locals that work in the area within blocks around the bar. Everyone was super nice and the girls definitely took care of me. Apparently if you're a regular (and it seems like most are), you're like family; I went with my friend and some regulars and their regular server (Roxy?) definitely took care of me; and after a while I told her to surprise me with drinks she thought I'd like based on what I'd been getting and I absolutely LOVED every single thing she brought me!   AND GET THIS...   My favorite part? I must have had about 10+ drinks on my tab and in Chicago...that's easily over $100. At 27th Avenue Bar...MY TAB WAS ONLY $40! How was that even possible?! It's not even like the drinks were super weak, because they were made perfect to me.    SO BASICALLY...  -Awesome atmosphere -Friendly people -Perfect drinks -SUPER low prices   Sounds great to me! I cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Good food, great service and they support nonprofits...what a great place to hang out!  So happy I stopped by for a drink with my friend. :)"}
{"text":"I am a die hard Broncos fan and this is a Raiders bar.  It has black and orange Harley Davidson colors on the outside and all black and silver on the inside.  The beer mug was cold but the beer tastes warm.  I will never go back to this bar and also biker colors are not allowed."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to just have some food and drinks on a weeknight.  Their shrimp tacos are amazing!  And happy hours drinks did the job!"}
{"text":"Well it seems that this place has zero accountability so there's no wonder why my food order was totally fubar when I received it. Ordered a patty melt.. simple enough, nope.. not for this dump. A hamburger patty on two pieces of plain white bread, a chimichanga that was total crap and terrible tasting wings.. was able to get refunded from #UberEATS but I still felt compelled to write a review to let other people know how terrible this place is."}
{"text":"Roxanne was really sweet and helpful. Definitely recommend this place , clean environment and really cheap deals for drinks. Will come back again :)"}
{"text":"I have been here numerous times and every visit has been great! The service is the best, especially if you see Roxy or Johnny. A very very clean bar and you really won't find drink specials any where else the way they do it at 27th. Not to mention some good bar food. There's always something going on here like boxing, UFC, and live music. My friends, family and I are always guaranteed a good time! Not to mention I live a distance from the bar and I'm always ready to make the trip."}
