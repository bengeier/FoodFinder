{"text":"It was only my first time there but so far VERY unimpressed.   I got one of the daily specials, the Stuffed Pepper and mashed potato.  The tomato sauce was cheep and lazily done, simply tomato soup, and the was little to no meat in the pepper... just rice.  And the mashed potato was more like sculpting clay.  My friend got the chopped sirloin it was a hamburger patty covered in onions and mushrooms and was very salty as was the gravy on the sculpting potatoes.  Would NOT RECOMEND."}
{"text":"This place is a great quick lunch spot! We usually run out from work and are able to get in and out in about 45 min! The breakfast menu is pretty great and quick... which we appreciate! The Greek Skillet is my favorite... Eggs, potatoes, feta, tomatoes and onions... Nice and simple but very filling! We like that it is not very busy so they can take our order and the food comes out quick and hot! Overall this is a great place to have in Garfield Heights!"}
{"text":"Very friendly service in a small space. Good for breakfast and quite affordable. I went yesterday with my stepdad and had the Mediterranean omelet with home fries and toast and it was flavorful. Today I went with my mom and had the breakfast burrito with hash browns my folks both had two eggs; over easy. One had sausage and the other bacon and were generous in size. Great place for comfort food!"}
{"text":"This little gem is too new to judge it with my normal tools, so today's review will be based on just the basics... The menu offerings are rather diverse and cover basic Americana as well as some European dishes. Breakfast seems to be their thing, but there was still a decent lunch crowd.

The atmosphere is total mom-and-pop shop complete with teal booths and old school placemats. The servers are friendly and eager, with the kid-next-door charm that you can expect in a neighborhood like this. The owner is a young native Clevelander who has been in the family restaurant business since he was twelve. This is his first venture into restaurant ownership and his passion for creating a truly welcoming neighborhood joint is very apparent. 

 The chicken noodle soup was clearly homemade and had that momma's kitchen flavor that I like.  The Bang Burger is already ranking in as a guest favorite, and not without proper cause.  It's a fresh patty topped with grilled ham, turkey, and provolone all on a grilled bun. Served along side crunchy fries. This burger is boss! 

Today's specials included a goulash served atop noodles, an open-faced roast beef sandwich with all of the fixins', and a beef kabob and fresh mashies combo. I sampled the goulash and must admit that the beef was ultra tender and it was uniquely seasoned. The surely instant potatoes that accompanied the goulash were topped with a really nice house-made gravy.  

The overall experience was pleasant and the food totally decent. This is good come-as-you-are kinda place. I will for sure be back and hope that others will give this little newbie a try. It's worth it. If I had to sum this place up with one statement it would be... A neighborly old school charmer that's home cooked classics help to warm up this horrid winter!"}
