{"text":"Very nice place, classy without pretension good food, hot staff, and I was surprised through all this they managed to also pull off a hip musical selection.
You can easily go there for a date or as a nice eat & drink before going out with your friends"}
{"text":"A great new place specializing in rotisserie chicken at the far east end of the Plateau. A big, open, bright, and beautiful space serving delicious food and cocktails. A group of us shared two whole chickens, which came with fries and coleslaw. I dare say it's the best rotisserie I have had in Montreal...very friendly service and casual atmosphere. Will definitely be returning to try their chimichurri...."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite places, the food is delicious, the cocktails are tasty and the staff is wonderful. They have one of the best Bloody Caesars in town and the tartar is a classic. This place is great for groups and to watch the hockey game."}
{"text":"We visited this pub for a light dinner while visiting Montreal on a girls weekend. It was a Friday evening. The hostess seated us outside quickly.
     The atmosphere was very nice, and the prices were reasonable-- 2 drinks, a salad and poutine classique for about $50. They did not have an English menu, so if you don't speak French you will have to work out the translation yourself. The poutine was good-- as told by a local, your poutine MUST have cheese curd, no other type of cheese or it is not authentic! The caprese salad with ricotta was also fresh and tasty-- I will try to recreate it at home!
      Our server was very friendly and even helped me fulfill an odd request-- I just had to get a local pint glass to bring back to my husband. She was absolutely wonderful and helpful and I would definitely recommend this for a quick meal while visiting the area. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that the menu is rather limited-- not too many healthy options. Otherwise, a great upscale pub."}
{"text":"I feel kind of torn about this place, but I'll start will all the positives: The staff were all quick, attentive, helpful, funny, and bilingual. The food was really good, seriously above average for this type of sport bar setting. There was lots of room at the bar and at booths surrounding - this is a big venue, great for groups watching a hockey game who want to eat well. There are screens pretty much everywhere you need them if you're a habs fan, but the rest of the decor is kind of country house, sportsy. 

Where we sat we were under a vent that blew cold air down our necks, if we were a smaller group I'd have suggested we move. I wish there were more local beers on the list but the cocktails were great. I don't live in this neighbourhood, so I'm not sure if it fills a hole or if the slightly high price point makes it an uncomfortable fit - it seemed like the latter to me, but I wouldn't know for sure. For a group of folks getting together to watch the game and eat good food it was a great choice and I was happy to be there."}
{"text":"Chaude ambiance au Sieur d'Iberville le soir du match de séries Ottawa- Montréal ! Assis au bar avec vue sur l'écran géant, entourés de supporters hyper motivés et bien excités nous aussi, nous avons passe une super soirée dans une ambiance qui restait bon enfant et conviviale, servis par une équipe sympathique et attentionnée malgré la foule et l'excitation ambiante. 
Une carte digne des gastro-pub qui allie les grands classiques de ce type d'établissement (burgers, salades, rôtisserie, plateaux de finger food a partager), et des plats plus originaux (a la carte ce jour la par exemple : cochon de lait farci a la brioche avec purée de pommes de terre au cheddar fumé et légumes rôtis dans une réduction de sirop d'érable et de Jack Daniels) Nous avons gouté les crevettes de Mantane , un peu huileuses mais délicieuses. Tous les plats, même les plus classiques, sont faits a partir de produits de qualité. Les burgers étaient très bons ( bon point pour les frites, fines et croquantes et pas trop grasses) et j'ai aussi gouté les betteraves cuites, ricotta et pistaches dans une petite vinaigrette a l'orange, original et fin. La prochaine fois je garderai un peu de place pour le pain perdu aux pépites de chocolat...
Un endroit parfait pour un verre ou un dîner entre amis!"}
{"text":"J'étais déjà allée au Sieur lors de son ouverture et la place m'avait laissée indifférente! Toutefois, j'y suis retournée et ils ont vraiment bien aménagé l'endroit et ils ont su créer un ambiance de \"pub festif fancy\" ! ahah, en gros, c'est comme être dans une cage aux sports, mais de riches, avec des bonnes bières et de bons plats raffinés (pour ce genre d'endroit normalement) !! Le pub était rempli lorsque nous y sommes allés, et pour les amateurs de sports, il y a des télés géantes qui diffusent les matchs! Les prix sont légèrement au-dessus de la moyenne niveau bières, mais je crois que tu paies pour la qualité! Bref, je souhaite longue vie à cet endroit !"}
{"text":"Finally great rotisserie chicken in Montreal! Absolutely delicious! They don't have spicy sauce, but their chicken gravy is just perfect. We also loved the poutine, untraditional, made with roasted baby potatoes, onion and chicken, a meal I would come back for. I also liked very much my endive and apple salad. 

Perfect choice of drinks, the Bloody Caesar is a must try. The list is impressive, including extensive Bourbon choices and nice beer selection. 

We felt very comfortable in our booth and the restaurant feels spacious with its nice layout. The service is a little bit immature, I'm sure the girls will learn with practice.

The trip to the east end of Mont Royal street was definitely worthy!"}
{"text":"I had solid service. Seated right away, drink order taken quickly and didn't wait long for food. 

Good beers and drinks. Also, the portobello burger is awesome!!! As a vegetarian that is always on the look out for something tasty- this is it."}
{"text":"I went with my sister and cousin. We sat at the bar and ordered a pitcher of sangria. It was delicious, and the environment was comfortable."}
{"text":"When it comes to finding a good spot to watch a game, it is amazing how little people generally care about the quality of the food. As long as the drinks are cheap and the screens are plentiful, we are suddenly okay with mediocre burgers, junky fries and bad fried foods. I, for one, want to enjoy both great food and a great sport watching experience - it really shouldn't be that hard to find. Recently, I organized a small Yelp event to watch the Habs play at a tavern that I hoped would be what I was looking for - Le Sieur d'Iberville.

Opened by a group headlined by Taverne on the Square's Chef Stephen Leslie late last year, Le Sieur d'Iberville is a revamp of an old neighbourhood taverne and a beautiful revamp at that. A massive bar at the center of the room is the focus of the space with tables all around. The room is quite large and thankfully isn't too cramped by the general \"flair\" that these kind of bars can use to create a vibe. The old visible beer elevator is a nice touch to the space's old roots. Music was a touch too loud for great conversation - I did find it a bit funny that they had a DJ at the bar for the night - but I did appreciate that they alternated between the live TV sound and music during commercials and intermissions.

A nice touch for Habs game is their free shot game. Each table selects a player for the game using cards. If that player scores, the table gets a free round of shots on the house. I selected Alex Galchenyuk and he actually scored so shots of vodka lime came quickly to the table. Fun way to get everyone involved in the game and create a little \"chatter\" between tables.

Foodwise, the menu is a nice blend of \"staple\" bar food with additions befitting a joint whose cousins include Monkland Tavern and Taverne on the Square. Two items present on our table which I didn't get a chance to try were the pork and beef chili nachos with house chips, corn, grilled tomato salsa, smoked cheddar, jalapeños, avocado puree and marinated onions as well as the Sieur Caesar salad with oven roasted tomatoes, house bacon, sourdough croutons and anchovy vinaigrette. In both cases, I enjoyed how more developed and refined Le Sieur made these dishes but still kept their essence in tact. Given how quickly both were finished, I believe my fellow diners would agree.

On my end, I first started with a dish that intrigued me tremendously when I read it - maple syrup braised bacon sticks. What I got wasn't exactly what I expected - more like a cubes of fatty ham than bacon but regardless... they were delicious. Fatty goodness with a touch of maple sweetness. A nice little salad on the side helped to make the dish feel a little lighter.

As a main, I went with the Sieur grilled cheese sandwich composed on rotisserie chicken from their house rotisserie, bacon, house cheddar, grain mustard, caramelized onions and a house squash relish. Just a wonderful sandwich - every component listed on the menu was perceptible and enjoyed tremendously together. Gooey, cheesy, sweet but with a hint of tang. The true star was the rotisserie chicken - just wonderfully moist and tender. Everything I had heard about the rotisserie was on-point. It is a guarantee that next time here I will order the chicken. I need to try it on its own now. 

As a side dish, my sandwich came with their Lyonnaise poutine comprised of grelot potatoes, onions, smoked cheddar and cheese curds. A intriguing play on a poutine which was best summarized by someone at our table - it's like a French onion soup in poutine form. The amount of cheese in this dish was absurd but oh so perfect. I really enjoyed the richness of the gravy but its consistency was more like a broth hence the perfect soup analogy. Very very good.

Finally, I couldn't leave without trying a dessert. The \"Ooey Gooey\" chocolate chip cookie with vanilla ice cream was a huge cookie baked in a mini skillet and yes it was certainly ooey and gooey. Quite easily shareable amongst friends, this rich and sweet cookie was a great way to finish the meal.

Le Sieur d'Iberville was exactly what I had hoped - a great bar to watch the game, enjoy a drink or two and have great food at the same time. Loved the overall feel of the place and definitely want to come back to try more of the menu. When people recommend a junky sport bar next time you want to watch a game somewhere, please remember Le Sieur d'Iberville - friends don't let other friends eat bad bar food. You won't regret it.

Cheers!"}
