{"text":"Good pizza, good pasta. BYOB which I love. This place fits well in Sewickley. A little pricey but a place we will continue to frequent. Their dessert is amazing..,"}
{"text":"Great service, great food! They we're also very kind when we broke a glass accidentally. Will come back here whenever we are traveling through the area."}
{"text":"This was my third time eating at Mambo, for various reasons such as trying a new place, going along with friends who wanted to eat here, giving it one more chance.  The wait is way too long each and every time.  They might have regulars, but that showing preference should not happen in this business.  My last visit, we used the app NO WAIT, and still had to wait longer than expected. We ate at a large, long table who had a party of ten at the other side - they all got served their dinner before us and so did other tables.  

When we asked about the Pancetta pasta, the server said it was cream, pancetta is pork, when asked about the delicious cheese, the server did not know the name of it. We could not get additional appetizer plates, nor additional forks or spoons as the dishwasher broke.

The food is great - the service, servers and atmosphere, not so much.

{"text":"First let me say that I agreed with the other reviewers up until my last dinner there.  To start, we had salads which ranged from just ok to pretty good.  I too had the linguine and clam sauce when I was there shortly after they opened and it was fantastic. I ordered it again and it was terrible! Overly salted and it has a ton of  pancetta (bacon) in it.  It didn't have bacon the first time that I had it. If this was intended to elevate the dish, it achieved the exact opposite. Last time I checked bacon does not belong in linguine and clam sauce. Plus, it was gummy. I love that they are using homemade pasta, it just needs to be executed properly. My daughter had spaghetti and meatballs. I CAN'T adequately describe how bad it was. It tasted like water. ZERO flavor. It didn't even have the taste of tomato and had no seasoning/salt whatsoever. It was odd tasting. We had a bit of the sauce on the side and sent it around the table for a taste test. We all agreed and all of us were perplexed.  How can you mess up basic tomato sauce??

The meatball lacked flavor as well. The pizzas are under done.  Plus, they also don't serve bread which I think is odd for an Italian restaurant. With that said, my daughter's bolognese was good the first time. I'm confused. DId they change chefs in the last two weeks?

I will say that they did an excellent job with the decor.  It's rustic chic. There are garage doors that open-perfect for a warm evening. I like that they are BYOB. 

Now, I'm not excited to write negative reviews. I just want them to succeed and serve good Italian food. Selfishly, I was excited to have another restaurant in the area.

Please be consistent!! Taste your food and don't put out anything substandard or people won't come back.  Hopefully, you are still working out the kinks. However, please don't change what's working!  I'm going to give Mambo another chance but I'm now skeptical."}
{"text":"Probably some of the best pizza that I have had outside of Italy, especially the crust which has a great wood-fired taste, but the prices are shockers especially considering the pizza sizes.

That would be tolerable if it weren't for the corkage charge of $8/bottle when there are good wines to be had for $10/bottle and the nearby liquor store.  I'm a firm believer that corkage charges should be to offset the cost of cleaning and maintaining the stemware and it certainly didn't cost $16 to clean three glasses.

For three of us, who had three pizzas, a salad and parts of two bottles of wine (using the same glasses) and \"community seating\" the cost was over $100. There are better places to spend that kind of money."}
{"text":"As one of few places available for dinner in Sewickley, I keep trying to like this place.  The atmosphere is cool, they offer a gluten free pizza, and I always prefer a decent BYOB.  The problem is the wait staff culture here.  We have gone here at 4-5 times now and each time it is the same lousy service and we are disappointed yet again.  If you read the reviews, it is definitely a recurring theme that is not being addressed.  Hoping they read this  (and all the others) and understand they need to hire people with some social skills!"}
{"text":"Lot of money spent on decor.  Not a lot on expertise.  Caesar salad was not a Caesar... Call it a toss salad, a few cherry tomatoes and vinaigrette with pepper and a \"fancy\" i.e. stale Parmesan cheese cracker sticking out the top.  Sorry, not a Caesar in any part of the world you came from.  Pizzas were under cooked, crust not thin enough, where's the olive oil to finish it?  Over staffed, I couldn't count how many waiters were clustered in the back just talking with one another, twittling their thumbs, standing in the way of the restroom... Really just obstructing space whilst the manager ran around slightly frayed, not managing.  Atmosphere was boisterous, dining room should be more dimly lit, at least for dinner.  One star for opening in Sewickey - God knows this town needs a little life, two for the decent albeit thrown together decor.  We'll call it \"fun\" design.  A long way to go to get three more."}
{"text":"Great place. The wood fired pizzas are amazing. The specials are out of sight and some of the best wedding soup I've had in a long time. Service was great and everyone was very helpful. It can be an inexpensive night out with a pizza and a salad or you can go all out with entrees and apps. Cool BYOB. 

Only bad this was the seating. Not the most comfortable and the tables and seating arrangements are way too close together."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and the service was fine.  The wife ordered wedding soup and a margarita pizza.  I didn't try the soup but the pizza was fine.   I wanted a salad with ranch dressing - but they don't have ranch so I passed.  I ordered the pasta with vodka sauce ($12) and asked that they add some chicken.   When I got the bill - they chicken was $6.   Adding 50% to the price of the entree seems excessive.   Even with the chicken- the pasta had zero taste.   The bill for 2 of us with the corkage fee for 1 bottle of wine and tip was $55.   Seems pretty step for what we got.  No rush to return."}
{"text":"Food awesome, ambiance awesome, service below average. It was busy, but the table next to us with a different server was two courses ahead of us and sat at the same time. I would go back but hope for a different server."}
{"text":"Staff was friendly, service was attentive, lasagna special was delicious with lots of meat, ricotta, and fresh sauce."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere great service and delicious food!  Stop driving by and enjoy a little vacation at home!"}
{"text":"I don't really get the bad reviews of this place. I stopped here for take-out on my way home one night. I'd been meaning to try it out because an Italian friend of mine likes it and I figured that was a good sign. The restaurant is small, bistro-like, with modern decor. Really cute, I'd love to actually dine in at some point. There were some families there with small kids as well as adults-only tables. It is BYOB. I got the special: pan roasted chicken over linguine with sun dried tomato cream sauce. It took ten minutes (I hadn't called ahead, just showed up in my gym clothes, sneakers, and parka, they were super-nice about it). It was expensive (close to 20 dollars) BUT this is home made pasta with home made sauce and fresh chicken. Hence the price. You get what you pay for and this was worth the money. It isn't the type of thing I can afford all the time unfortunately, but I did get two meals out of the portion size. My only complaint is that they didn't include a vegetable with the meal and don't have side orders of vegetables. They have beans and greens and salads which cost around seven to nine dollars (They looked quite lovely. I didn't order one because I was going home and figured I could just make one myself). 

One aside for reviewers who have complained about the menu: this is Neapolitan Italian food not Sicilian Italian food. They are both \"real\" Italian, just different cuisines from different regions of Italy. Neapolitan has more cream sauces, white wine, and long pasta. If you want red sauce on everything you want Sicilian. Bread is not normally served with meals in Italy as the pasta or pizza is your carbohydrate. Also Sewickley is an affluent area and the rents reflect that fact. The cost of the space gets passed on to customers in the menu prices. When you factor that in along with the quality of ingredients that are used, I don't think their prices are unfair."}
{"text":"If I could give it a half star,  I would. I used no wait app at 5:50 and it said 32 min. I checked in and it was another 45-60. Then, we got our text at 7:00 that our table was ready. The restaurant was cool at 5:50. Upon our arrival, it was hot and humid and the door was open to the outside. It was about 90 degrees and miserably hot in the restaurant. It took over an hour to receive our food. We don't mind waiting for food, but in an environment that wAs extremely hot; it was unbelievable. The owner came over and was unapologetic for the food taking so long and instead of reassuring us it was almost ready, asked if we thought we were at Burger King. Eat at your own risk at this establishment!"}
{"text":"Delizioso!!  Highly recommend the Nutella stuffed pizza for dessert.  OMG. 

Pretty loud in there though. My mother-in-law with hearing aids couldn't keep up with the conversation and couldn't hear the waitress when she was addressing her. So awesome food, but not the greatest atmosphere."}
{"text":"I would not recommend this restaurant.  The arancini was good.  The linguine with clam sauce was passable.  The wait in between courses was extremely slow and this was a Tuesday night.  I could not imagine what it would be like on a weekend.  The server did not check on us in between courses and had attitude."}
{"text":"I love that Mambo is BYOB and love their pasta and pizza. I have been here several times recently. A couple of areas where I wish they would improve: 1. Restaurant temp. Visited last week and the inside of the restaurant was warm, then they opened the front sidewalk \"garage type\" door and it got really warm in the restaurant. Opening that door to accommodate three tables on the sidewalk didn't seem like a good trade since it became really warm inside. 2. There was a keyboard player playing inside the restaurant. It made the atmosphere louder and the music being played didn't add to the atmosphere at all. It actually was a bit of an odd choice of music. I would eliminate the keyboard player. 3. I hate when our server (Cassandra) didn't write down our order (party of 5). She forgot my salad.  Please write it down, especially when you are busy. 4. I had the veal Marsala. The veal was not tender at all, it was very tough."}
{"text":"I'll be brief. Wedding soup was pretty bland. Beans and greens was overwhelmed with onions. Spaghetti and meatballs were terrible, tasted like someone put the entire basil plan in the meatballs and sauce. The pasta wasn't drained so my sauce was watery (pet peeve of mine). My wife got a pizza which was good."}
{"text":"Good food, good service. They need some acoustic tiles on the ceiling to dampen noise when the space gets full - gets loud fast."}
{"text":"Delicious Evening!  Our table of 4 could not have been happier! From the Meatballs, stuffed banana peppers fresca salad and the absolute BEST Beans and greens this Italian has ever eaten! to the fantastic Bolognese pasta, and Margherita pizza ending with delish  Tiramisu!  It was one of those meals we  were still talking about the next day.  We will be back very soon!
Service was excellent! Just remember BYOB."}
{"text":"Had the most amazing meal here last night. Everything from start to finish was delicious. The overall atmosphere is great, and the service was friendly and attentive. But the food is what was really worth writing about. We started with the arancini which was seasoned perfectly and had a great balance of crispy and creamy. The bolognese sauce served with the arancini was unbelievable and full of flavor. We were literally eating the sauce with spoons after the arancini was gone. Next we shared the shrimp scampi pasta and the Mambo pizza. The pasta was packed with large sautéed shrimp and covered in a light, buttery garlic sauce. The pizza was everything pizza should be-- crispy, chewy and cheesy with a fresh tomato sauce, salty prosciutto and peppery arugula. We finished our meal with coffee and the tiramisu which did not disappoint. Light and creamy, a perfect end to an amazing meal. We will definitely be back and can't wait to try more items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Fantastic place. Great service and great Italian food/pizza.   We had the meatballs appetizer and pizza for dinner.  The meatballs are a great mix of pork and veal.  We had the Mambo pizza.   It was recommended by the friendly staff, and was fantastic.  The food here is perfectly done.  2nd best pizza place I have been to in Pittsburgh, and there are lots of good ones.  Well worth the drive to Sewickley."}
{"text":"Great food if you like Good food.  Not your take out nasty. Salad had fresh greens, great Gorgonzola, and not too much dressing.  Pizza is up there with Cucina Bella, fresh, thin crust with proper Italian toppings. Service was as good as the food.  BYOB is never a bad thing."}
{"text":"We're so glad to have Mambo Italia in Sewickley. We've been here several times now.Service is great; love their pizzas and the penne arabiato (sp?)-good taste and nicely spicy. We sat at the pizza bar and love to watch the action."}
{"text":"This place is so cute, right in the heart of Sewickley.  If you use their suggested \"NO WAIT\" app you are sure to get a table right away.  We had a party of 8 and sat right down. 
The beans and greens were exceptional- as was my husband's pasta bolognese.  I had the fig pizza which was crispy and delicious.  

The kids ordered the nutella  pizza for dessert.  The nutella mixed with the salty pizza crust was delicious.  The tiramisu was the best we've had in a long time.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Four of came here for dinner on a weekday night. We had a reservation and got a separate table. There wee long communal tables too. 
The lighting is perfect. The music volume so that you can talk but also hear it. 
I started with a Caesar salad with no croutons. Then went into the funghi Margherita pizza with a request for a side of arugula to put on top. And had ice cream for dessert.
My salad was delicious- crisp, fresh, cold, and garnished with a Parmesan crisp on top. They offered more grated cheese which I gladly accepted. The anchovies were separate and a bit strong. I prefer them integrated more. 
My pizza took me back to Italy immediately! I ate it all! 
For dessert I had the Caramel cashew vanilla ice cream. Wow! It tasted like butter pecan and I wanted to take a gallon home! 
The service was great. Our waiter did not hover but was there when we needed him. The place is BYOB and the corkage charge was $8 per bottle of  wine and $1 per beer. This was surprising to me because I usually see places with a liquor license and corkage fee or no license and no fee. 
Overall excellent feel, great food, and great service. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I wanted to love it as the atmosphere is great and the service is informal and quite good.  But, the food is very average and the price/value is terrible.  

My comment is not about quantity, it is purely based on quality.  Consider,,,

Taggliatelle Bolognese - good pasta, tasty sauce, small plate size for $17.  Not bad and worth it

Fig/Goat cheese/Prosciutto pizza - 12\" pizza with stretchy, not crisp crust and nothing special in the flavor.for $20???   That is criminally bad.  

Could be great, but far from it and ridiculously overpriced."}
{"text":"Mambo Italia has become quite popular since it opened last year in Sewickley. Every time I drive by Mambo, it seems packed to the brim. I've only been here twice, but I can say that the pasta is very fresh. Both times, I went with their gnocchi, and it's melt in your mouth goodness. The best gnocchi, I've ever had!  Garnished with basil and ricotta cheese, it's prepared to perfection. This is not your typical rubbery, tasteless gnocchi, but a delicate gnocchi with even a potato taste and consistency.

So before this becomes solely an ode to their gnocchi, I will mention that my experiences with the waitstaff has been mixed. In particular an instance with their hostess did not sit very well with me. She was neither welcoming nor very professional. Thus some of the run-ins mentioned by other reviewers do not seem like much of a stretch. 

But if you are just going to the food, it is worth it. Just keep in mind you will pay a premium for it ..."}
{"text":"Not a fan.  Been here a handful of times and while the food is ok, the service is terrible and the seating and acoustics are downright uncomfortable. Poor design and their inability to hire and train good service staff have kept me away.  Last time we went, we had a simple order, a salad and one pizza. Waited FOREVER and the pizza showed up. We had to tell our server that we didn't get our salad.  The chef sheepishly brought one over but by that time we were less than impressed.  It's amateur hour compared to il Pizzaioli or other upscale pizza restaurants."}
{"text":"Went here last night for the first time and I was really impressed.  I'm a big fan of il pizzaiolo and piccolo forno and they've got nothing on mambo italia.  I loved the Linguine with Clams - really reccomend it!"}
{"text":"Caesar and Meatballs were 5 Star.
    Heads up BYOB- BUT cork fee all good!
Well staffed, well decorated, but building could use some work."}
{"text":"Everything was excellent. Pasta cooked perfectly. It was fairly busy Saturday around 6:20 and the hostess had a hard time telling us how long the wait would be for 2. What was stated as 20 minutes turned into 40 but in the end the food was worth it."}
{"text":"This was our first time eating here. The only plus to this experience was that we didn't wait as long as we expected. It was extremely crowded and the tables were too close together for comfort. I ordered the chicken fettuccine, which was VERY bland, the chicken basically had no taste whatsoever. My husband ordered the shrimp scampi- both entrees were disappointingly small portions. We will not be returning for a second time."}
{"text":"Mambo is one of our daughter's favorites!  She loves the pasta.  We like the pizza too."}
{"text":"Great BYOB!! Delicious pizza and salad- stop at Lula before if you can't get a table and they will call you!!"}
{"text":"My mom and I went here at around 4:30 on a Wednesday. The place was absolutely empty, but the hostess says we can't sit at the high top because \"those are for 4 people\" wtf? No one is here! (see the pictures I posted). Literally, not one other table was occupied. Not even that, but we walked around for like 2 hours afterward and NO ONE was ever sitting at that high top. Can you tell I am bitter?? I have no problem with the food here, the pizza is not the best or the worst that I have had, but their hostess/customer service (and by that I am referring to the hostess, NOT the wait staff) is terrible. Our waiter on the other hand was great.I probably won't go back, it's not just that she wouldn't seat us there it was how she treated us in general and her attitude to everyone. Gross."}
{"text":"The service is excellent and the pizzas are generous, hearty, and delicious. High quality ingredients, great plating of appetizers, and BYOB option. Also use the NoWait App so you can shop around town and receive a text message when your table is ready."}
{"text":"Mambo where have you been? Love this place. Come early because all of Sewickley are going and word is getting out. We went for Pizza ready in 5 minutes and then tried the Pasta and it's THE BOMB. BYOB, Family Style, Priced Right, and most important the food is delicious."}
{"text":"Great add to Sewickley. Convivial atmosphere, enthusiastic staff."}
{"text":"Awesome dinner with great friends! Pizza and pasta was delicious. Server was very attentive. Owner stopped by the table to say hello. Atmosphere was fantastic!"}
{"text":"I had low expectations because the reviews weren't amazing but I was really pleasantly surprised!! 

First of all I have to comment on the service...AMAZING. probably the best service I've had at a restaurant in a long time. Our waitress was extremely attentive but not invasive and never left us without a full drink (in some tiny glasses!) We sat at the pizza bar and some of the chefs behind the bar checked on us as well and were interested as to whether we liked our food. Every person I encountered on the staff was extremely friendly and helpful. 

Now the food, we started with the wedding soup which was very tasty and had lots of \"stuff\" in it, which is great! Next was the mambo pizza and one more (whose name I forget) that had ricotta, Peruvian peppers and sausage. Both were Delicious. The crust was crispy on the outside and slightly charred, and the inside was soft and doughy. The toppings were plentiful and extremely fresh. Half a pie was enough for both of us. 

Finished a great meal with a piece of tiramisu, which was delicious and was inhaled so quickly I can't comment on it much more. I thought the \"m\" on top in powdered sugar was a cute touch. 

The atmosphere inside was loud but in an energetic way. Just be wary if you prefer quiet dining because there was definitely not a quiet spot in the place. I liked sitting at the pizza bar because we could watch the chefs work. For two sodas, soup, two pizzas and dessert the bill came to $59."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great food, and it's byob. New favorite local spot. The fresh pizzas are delicious. Their gnocchi is one of the best I ever had...melts in your mouth.  I've been here 4 or 5 times and will continue to be a regular!"}
{"text":"Yummy! Food was tasty and well prepared. Our server was friendly and attentive even with handling us AND a large party at the exact same time. We waited a little longer than I would of liked for the food but we came to find out it was because they remade our pizza because they felt it wasn't good enough for us. The seating is a little odd with a large part of it being a sort of community table in the middle of the restaurant. The booth seating is very \"friendly\" too. We will go back for sure but maybe when we can get a less social seating arrangement. Oh and we strongly recommend utilizing the No Wait app."}
{"text":"Went back after the last time they told us we had to come back because they had 2 minutes til they opened.

They turned me off right away by telling us parties of 2 can't sit at the table...they are for parties of 4.  We could either sit at the bar or the booth/chair combo (where the tables are about 4 inches apart).  I do not like dining at the bar, but chose that.

We ordered the gnocchi and a pizza.  I guess I should have read the menu better because I'm used to spaghetti sauce on my gnocchi.  These are made in a sage/butter combination.  They were ok, but not anything like my husband's Italian grandmother used to make.  The server was kind enough to give us a cup of sauce.  Unfortunately, it had a sour-like taste and very unappealing.  The pizza is ok at best, plus they cut it into 4 jumbo slices. They need to make the slices normal for people to share instead of the customers cutting every slice in half

Price wise, this place isn't worth it.  I think the gnocchi was $17 and you get about 13-15 of them.

Very noisy.  Couldn't even hear my husband  and he's sitting next to me.  Only good thing about this place is the decor."}
{"text":"Overall, bad experience here.

If I had known it would be double the amount of time to be seated than they told us, the food would be blah but expensive, and the service to be just okay, I never would have gone.

For starters, we had a party of 3. We checked in with the hostess to put our name on the list and were told it would be 30 minutes or less. I received a No Wait text confirmation on my phone and was told I would be texted when our table was available. It was cold out but we walked around and came back after 30 minutes. We ended up not getting seated for an hour and waited outside in the cold, the staff didn't seem concerned/apologetic for the inconvenience once they seated us. 

The food was decent, but definitely NOT worth the price value. I got a the pesto white pizza which was $14 and the meatball appetizers for $9, both of which were just okay and definitely not worth the price. The pizza was wood fired but stretchy and bland, and the meatballs were hard and lacked flavor. 

The service was a bit strange. It was a very cold night out and they left the door to the restaurant wide open....throughout our meal several customers were clearly cold and got up during their meal to close the door and the hostess didn't seem to care/accommodate at all for this. 

The atmosphere in the restaurant was okay but the seating is a bit weird. 

I definitely will not be going back."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for quite some time. I went last night and still can't decide if I liked it or not. The service was average. The atmosphere was loud. The seating was a bit strange. One giant table down the middle of the room where you were seated with others. 

The shrimp alfredo I ordered was a bit bland.

However the chicken piccata we ordered was the best I have ever had. I would go back to try other meals based on the amazing flavor of this chicken alone."}
{"text":"The restaurant was very busy when we arrived and we were seated at the \"pizza bar\", which proved to be a good thing...fun to watch the work in the kitchen and somewhat less noisy than the rest of the room. The noise level was a big negative for me. We'll go back, but not until later in the evening.

The pizza was very good; my linguine with clams excellent. Nice service.

I'd give it a five except for the noise level and the extreme corkage fee."}
{"text":"VERY good Italian food with such flavorful, fresh cheeses. The burrata appetizer was incredible. I got a gluten-free Margherita pizza which was fine (normal GF crust) but the mozzarella on it was so flavorful. Prices were a bit upscale but not outrageous for a Sewickley restaurant. We will return!"}
{"text":"This is a fun place with excellent food.  I don't feel their pizza is on par with Il Pizzaiolo or Piccolo Forno, but it's a close third.  We sat outside, which was lovely, however I can see how it might be loud for people sitting inside.  The menu is creative and fun.  We split a Toscana salad (Arugula, asiago, pear, walnuts, champagne vinaigrette) and the portion was perfect for 2.  We also had the Pizza Vegetariana (Tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, zucchini, eggplant, artichokes, mushrooms, grape tomatoes, fresh basil) and it was delicious.  This restaurant is BYOB with an $8 corkage fee.  It would be nice to see them lower the fee to $5, but after all, this is Sewickley.  Our service was prompt and cheerful.  I would enjoy going back again, and I would definitely recommend to a friend."}
{"text":"6 of us entered all of us were disgusted.
Seems that the Female Chef whoever she was
appeared drunk and was screaming at people
in the kitchen near to where we all were.
WE WILL NOT be back.
Food ok but she caused a scene in front of EVERYONE.
NOT good for business.?"}
{"text":"My wife went here Friday night with 3 friends for her birthday dinner.  After a long wait the service was super slow and inexperienced,  they have a $8.00 per bottle cork fee ( and one was a screw cap ) give me a rip.off break, the food was just fair,  nothing that tasted like the price hey charged and to top the whole thing off,  while finishing their dessert ( Nutella pizza which was awful btw ) the manager came by and asked them to leave because they have people waiting!  What a joke! Rude beyond words to ask a paying dinner party to leave just because they can't schedule the  restaurant properly.  The manager told the table next to them to wrap it up and leave too. Do yourself a favor,  if you want Italian food, go to a mom and pop where the food is excellent and your made to feel at home."}
{"text":"I'm a bit torn about this review, because there are some excellent things about it, and not-so excellent things about my experience.  

Specifically, in terms of the customer experience, I felt that there was a line being walked, and it wasn't a good one.  I had a large party and I knew that the restaurant doesn't take reservations.  I stopped by in person several weeks beforehand to inquire how to go about getting a big group into the restaurant, and was advised to use NoWait and/or call ahead.  When we arrived to check in, we were told that we likely had a 45 minute wait and advised to go somewhere nearby to have a drink and wait it out. I wasn't surprised and had already managed the expectations of the group.  So, we did exactly that, and by some miracle a table freed up within minutes.  A friend and I returned immediately to claim our spot, and as soon as we sat down I texted back to my friends to let everyone else know to come back quickly as soon as they were finished with their drinks (that they had just ordered) at the other location.  In the several moments that followed, I was approached by both a hostess and the manager one after the other, and was informed that if the rest of my party didn't show up asap, others could get seated in their place because they didn't like to leave seats empty.  I understand the economics of having empty seats in a restaurant that can't sell alcohol, but frankly, that shouldn't have been made my issue when I complied with everything that was asked of me, and circumstances beyond either of our control made for a delay in seating the whole party.

That said...our server took really excellent care of us, and the food was absolutely delicious.  She was even willing to try and work with us to sort out the check because apparently they will not split checks for large parties. Unfortunately, the split that was offered was to do it equally 5 ways between the 10 of us, which would have been very unfair to some people in the group. So we did go with the one check and sorted out money exchange among ourselves.  Again, I understand the economics of that from the business side, but all in all, I don't think this restaurant is friendly to large parties, and I wouldn't try to bring one here again."}
{"text":"Service was great. Food left a lot  to be desired. This was a \"try it once\" restaurant for me.  My wife is a fourth generation Italian American and her ancester would roll over at what they called Italian cooking.  The noise level was excusiating, they payed Italian music so loud that everyone  had to talk louder to be heard over it. Nice yuppie atmosphere...but if you're  going to call it an Italian  restaurant....make some Italian  food. Revise your memu and I'll  consider coming back...if not, it's  a one time shot."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant on a Wed. night and were meeting another couple. We walked in and said there were 4 of us as we were meeting another couple in a few mins. There were many tables vacant but we were told we were not allowed to sit till the other couple arrived. We waited outside and smelled the smoke from the cigar bar beside the restaurant. 
I had a caesar salad which was mainly romaine with croutons and a slice of thin cheese. I tasted no dressing, very bland. My wife and me split a pizza which was just OK. Good crust around the pizza but the bottom was limp and soggy, just OK. Corkage is $8 for a bottle of wine and you are given a tumbler, not even a stemmed glass for that amount. They gave us a bottle of water for the table but took it away and we had to ask for it back. I will not return and can not recommend."}
{"text":"When we arrived at the hostess station on this rainy Wednesday night we were assigned seats at the bar in front of the kitchen with no input from us. There were tables available but they apparently were not available to us - not a good start. 

Things went better thereafter, with quick service, uncorking of the wine, and delivery of the food. The Arrancini was about the best we've had. One of the entres, a spicy pasta, was pretty good, but the other chicken dish was too bland. It's a loud, open room and the menu is just pizza and pasta. The BYOB feature is a money saver. Overall, an okay place for a weekday pasta dinner, but no more than that."}
{"text":"A buddy introduced me to Mambo after having a few pints down the street.    I noticed the imported brick oven and had high expectations.

We sat at the counter where I had an opportunity to observe the magic being performed for each pizza creation.

They have a very good menu that offers salads, pastas, and a variety of pizzas.     We ordered a very basic pizza (Margherita).   They know what they are doing!   The pizza was crispy, chewy, and gooey.

The place features a BYOB policies (charge a corking fee).

Next time I am in Sewickley - I will be back."}
{"text":"We had take out one time and went in to let them know that the food wasn't up to par and they cursed at us. Literally, \"F\" bomb this and that. Completely unprofessional and discourteous."}
{"text":"I come here frequently, so this review encompasses my last 10 or so visits.

This place just cannot seem to get it right. In Sewickley, unfortunately, they aren't alone. The atmosphere at Mambo is decent, and the food sometimes borders on great, but the service is almost always remarkably slow, and is sometimes outright snotty. Other reviewers capture the specifics in detail, so if you want to read episodic outrage or delight, read those reviews. From mine, take that when you visit Mambo, you have slightly less than a coin toss' chance of having an overall satisfying experience."}
{"text":"There food prices are very expensive for what you get our waiter did not ask if we wanted more to drink or not"}
{"text":"Excellent beans and greens, salads, pizza!  Server was friendly and courteous!  Will definitely be back!  Mikie C."}
{"text":"After reading mixed reviews I was somewhat skeptical about trying this place out. I went during the week shortly after they opened for dinner and was pleased that the hostess was friendly and gave my any option of where I wanted to sit. She recommended the bar where they make the pizza so I took her up on the offer. The waitress was very friendly and helpful with suggestions. 

We ordered the arancini for an appetizer and it was ok, but nothing special. For dinner we had the tagliatelle bolognese and the mambo Rosso pizza. The pasta was good but the pizza lacked some real flavor. 

Im giving this place 2 stars bc I would have hoped for more in Sewickley. I'd go to Marios in Beaver, Anthony's Coal fire in Robinson or Stone in Pittsburgh. I also wasn't too happy about their kitchen. When you sit at the bar and the chef is just standing 10 feet from you, you might think that they make speak to you or see how you like the food. I'm not asking for a full blown conversation but the place wasn't even that busy. I would also think that the chef wouldn't rub his eyes and put eye drops in his eyes in front of customers.  I know that tons of things happen in kitchens that we probably don't want to know about but use some discretion when working in an open kitchen."}
{"text":"So loved this place!  I couldn't give it five stars for a couple of reasons I will explain shortly.  But first of all, I love the decor...it's like a rustic chic type of vibe.  The place isn't huge, but they fit a lot of seating between the pizza bar seats and the huge, long table in the center.  We are wood-fired, Neapolitan-style pizza snobs, having had some really great experiences where we used to live in Dallas and Minneapolis before that, so I'm happy to say that this pizza was up there!  So far the best from what we've tried in Pittsburgh so far.  The crust is good, red sauce is very tasty - two things you need for Neapolitan-style pizza to be on point.  We had the Mambo, which was good, but I'm excited to try different pizzas in the future.  The burrata appetizer is SO good.  At first, I was disappointed that it wasn't served with wood-fired cooked bread, but they serve it with perfectly dressed greens and cherry tomatoes that I thought went really well.  We also got the penne pasta with vodka sauce.  I'm a big fan of vodka sauce.  I didn't love the first couple of bites for some reason, but it grew on me and served as a great dipping sauce for the pizza crust.

A couple of changes I would recommend.  Do something with cooking bread (preferably drizzled with olive oil) in the wood fired oven...take full advantage of that thing!  I don't think it's necessary to serve bread to everyone but it would have been a nice touch for at least the burrata app, maybe even other apps too.  The other recommendation is to put out some olive oil bottles and maybe even balsamic vinegar bottles.  The crust of this type of pizza is best dipped in olive oil.  Otherwise, I personally won't eat it (although the vodka sauce did serve as a good dip).  Also, we didn't bring wine, but an $8 corking fee is a bit excessive.  I think $5 is reasonable.  But that wouldn't keep me from coming back."}
{"text":"The good - 

Pizza ingredients were VERY fresh and the pizza was \"light\". The portions were good but you did not feel like you had eaten a brick when you were done.

Some have complained about the price, but I felt the prices were fair considering the freshness of the ingredients.

The decor is nice (my fiancee says it's \"just like if Pinterest opened a restaurant)

Polite, efficient server

The Bad - 

It's LOUD. Crazy loud. We were seated across from one another at a very small table and eventually gave up speaking to one another as it was just too loud to hear.

Crowded. When we were there, there were only maybe 5 or 6 empty seats and, to be honest, the place was already at about 10 or 12 more people than it could comfortably handle. We felt crammed in like sardines and heaven help you if you're seated at the long bench/chair combo section against the wall and the person seated behind you at the long table in the middle of the room needs to get up a lot. Your chairs are going to collide every time.

Long wait time between ordering and receiving the food. We waited almost 40 minutes. The couple next to us (who ordered BEFORE us) waited even longer.

They ran out of Coke while we were there. Not a huge issue, but that's the first time that's ever happened to me. I just found it odd.

8$ uncorking fee PER BOTTLE of wine. 

Over-all, I would not go back. The pizza, while very fresh (and not overly expensive in my opinion), was very bland.  Add to that  the excessive noise (they really need to look into some noise dampening) and borderline claustrophobic conditions and I just don't think this place is for me."}
{"text":"cheese was off, crust was sub par; hard to get a call back after bad service  why dont they have an answering machine?"}
{"text":"This Italian restaurant is delightful. Wonderful food, nice atmosphere. I would've left a review of five stars, however our waiter, Lane left a bad taste in our mouths. I'm not sure whether it was a rough day for him or what was going on, but there is no reason for what happened this evening. It started with him slamming the bottles of water on the table, sliding the wine glasses. Did not pour the wine after uncorking the bottle along with throwing the wine cork onto the table.  Our bread was delicious, but it wasn't offered to us, we had to ask for it and; even then, it arrived ten minutes after our meal. We were never asked how our meals were. But don't worry, we were asked if we would like dessert."}
{"text":"Had the worst experience!  Waited well over an hour for our food, and it was mediocre at best!  Save your money, support another local restaurant.  Ann the owner was one of the rudest people I have ever met. Arguing and berating us over our food wait time.  Every table was complaining, never witnessed such poor customer service and outright rude behavior toward guests!  She asked us if we thought we were at Burger King!  Who says that to a paying customer in your restaurant!!  Ann, try kindness and appreciation! Also, learn how to run a restaurant !  Wish I could say the food was worth the hassle, but food was average!  No air conditioning either! In the summer, with a hot pizza oven!"}
{"text":"This is my second time visiting Mambo Italia so I guess it's about time I write a review. This place is great. It's pretty small inside with about a dozen table around the outside with a large table that runs the length of the restaurant in the middle. I've only sat at the large table because I've always been with a large group. I like it!

The menu is a handful of great pasta dishes or wood fired pizza. The wood fired pizza is really good and there are a lot of choices to be had. My cousin said it best about the menu, she said that she could order anything on the menu and like it, and I agree.

The wait staff is nice and friendly and came by often to check on us. They have a BYOB policy and do charge a corking fee, so be aware. Great place, great atmosphere.l, and great food. What's not to like!"}
{"text":"The pizza is good, but be prepared to wait a long time! I've been here twice, and the first time, our party of 6 waited over 2 hours for pizza. On our most recent visit, there were just two of us, and it took around an hour to get our pizza. If you're not in a rush or hungry (as the pizza's are also pretty small for the price), this is a place to try."}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times and the food is always up to par. Pizzas are great and I am a huge fan of BYOB. If you don't have a bottle of wine you can stop by Sidelines, located around the corner, and choose from hundreds of bottled beers to get a nice 6 pack to-go, I think it was about a dollar a beer corkage fee if I recall correctly. They have nice outdoor seating as well. 

Give it a shot if you are looking for a good quality, neapolitan pizza in a great atmosphere over a nice BYOB of wine."}
{"text":"Interesting atmosphere!! We sat at the pizza bar in the back. It was cool to watch them make the pizza in the wood fired oven.  Many choices of pizza, not your ordinary pizza. Tasted fresh and the crust has a nice flavor. We watched the dishes come out of the pen kitchen and everything looked fresh and tasty.  Portions are perfect for one person. The pizza is about 12 inches round. Great to share. The salads looked fresh.  Only down side is the noise level. The middle of the restaurant is one long table and it's difficult to hear the person sitting across from you. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Prosciutto, Fig, Goat Cheese Pizza was fantastic!  The Ricotta dessert w/ honey & berries was out of this world!  Great surroundings, Wonderful service, & Charm!  (BYOB)"}
{"text":"We have given Mambo a few tries but they have disappointed each time.  The space is really nice, but whether it be their terrible service (especially their owner), below average food or above average prices, it's really not worth you time.  There are better options for Italian food in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite  places  in Sewickley  food always good and who knows who you'll  see ? Last time in Mario Lemieux"}
{"text":"Truly one of the best Italian restaurants around. DO NOT LET THE BAD REVIEWS TURN YOU AWAY!! I swear they don't know what they're talking about!! My boyfriend and I have gone three times now and request to sit at the bar-- you seem so involved watching them cook. The service is amazing. We were never left unsatisfied while the cooks, waitresses and the owner asked about our food, always made sure we had a full glass and clean plates for every course. The pizza, salad, appetizers and desserts are all beautiful and delicious. Both Doug and Kevin that work on the oven are so sweet and cook the pizza to perfection. This is one lucky restaurant to have such great people! Our waitresses (though I don't remember names but one was the owners daughter) were so attentive and so helpful. Will most definitely become regulars, I don't know how you couldn't!"}
{"text":"Such a pretty place with a super sweet hostess,but horrible service. Our waitress put in our order and the food came out wrong. My 2 year old son and I were food less bc our gluten free pizza was put in regular and my appetizer salad came out with food. My husband finished his meal b4 our pizza was ready. No silverware or napkins after asking twice and no remedy to our bill after waiting an hour for our meal due to waitress error."}
{"text":"The food here is great! We've been 4-5 times and eaten the salads pizza and pasta all have been excellent. The service has always been great as well but the noise volume is so loud you can't carry on a conversation unless you join in on the yelling. It's a bit annoying for a date night and it's been that way every time we've gone. The only other issue is that a pizza costs $18 on average and it's small and not worth that much. The taste is there but certainly overpriced but that's Sewickley for ya!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food. Great atmosphere.  We love this neighborhood Italian restaurant.  Used the Nowait app which really helps on a busy weekend night. We ordered appetizers, salads, meatballs, pasta and dessert.  Everything was prepared perfectly.  We found the food and service to be excellent!"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to having dinner at Mambo on Saturday night. I brought two bottles of wine and wanted to sit outside with my wife and my cousin. The servers brought over three wine glasses and all three were filthy, along with the also dirty flatware. I asked my server for new wine glasses and he returned with three more dirty wine glasses. Mine had lipstick on it. I told my server that these were also dirty. The owner came over with three more that had greasy fingerprints on them. Rather than apologize and bring three clean glasses, the owner said that the greasy fingerprints were mine. Poor customer service. After two complaints he should have washed them himself, but he was in denial. Otherwise the restaurant was pretty. The food was average although the pasta was cooked nicely el dente. The waiters were very inexperienced. They hovered and did not offer ground pepper or bread. Our salads and entrees came out all at the same time. Ghastly pink t shirts were worn by the staff."}
{"text":"One of the worst dining experience ever...the food is overrated...the vodka sauce was running and tasteless and the pasta had no flavor and that was the highlight of my dinner....the service was horrendous...my waitress was full of attitude and when I asked her for bread and grated cheese you would have thought I'd asked her to walk across burning coals barefooted...will never go again and will never recommended it."}
{"text":"Below is a previous review...we've always had a great experience at Mamba....last night was disappointing.  Reason being is I have gotten the chicken piccata several times in past and they served three medium sized breasts with a side...this visit they served three chicken tenders...two of the pieces might have been two bites and one was so small it was one bite.  Also, the pizza had three big burnt large bubbles...should have never have served us that pizza.  I do understand that with a wood fired oven like Marba has that one of the pizza qualities is small dark specks/bubbles on crust...but ours was over done on crust...also the pizza wasn't cut.  As far as Service...waited way too long for our salads...had no wait getting seated and the place wasn't full.  So no excuse for the slow service.  I dropped my review to three stars cause the atmosphere is always great...take away that and I would have given two.  I hope next visit is improved.  Get back the three chicken breast on the piccata....why change something that's perfect!!!  Thank you.


First review gave four stars...below write up.

After reading the reviews I had to chime in.  Have been here several times and it is very good.  The gnocchi is the best and served on Saturday only.  The pizza is awesome, chicken piccata and Romano style is great, the salads are great, the pasta dishes are good...one complaint I have is the bolognese sauce needs to be meatier.  Great atmosphere...yes, they have a large community table in center of restaurant, but it's very comfortable and roomy.  Yes, on a weekend night you'll have a long wait if you just show up and add your name to list.  They do use \" No Wait\" app...we use the No Wait app all the time for this restaurant and we time our arrival so we've never waited more than 1/2 hour.  The service is very good...one time we had a new server that made a couple mistakes, but it was handled perfectly by manager.

As far as some reviewers complaining about price...it's not overpriced for the quality you receive.  In today's restaurants an $8 per bottle corkage fee is not a bad price...in Sewickley you'd  be paying $8+ for mediocre glass of wine.

Highly recommend....use the No Wait app."}
{"text":"Really great if you want lots of sauce and don't mind the family (unruly kids) atmosphere. It was hard to hear and the food, average. They don't serve wine, which is a bummer. I did not have the pizza which I have heard is quite good. I'll try again as I have heard good things about this restaurant. After I go again, I'll modify my rating if needed. Cool looking place and I love the openness."}
{"text":"Our favorite restaurant. Amazing pizza, pasta, salads, appetizers, meatballs, dessert pizza, and staff. Truly incredible on every level. Not to be missed."}
{"text":"We love mambo. We come here almost every week. We love the pizzas especially the honeybee pizza. Wonderful! The salads are also very good."}
{"text":"Kind of a tough one to rate for me. Food was good; service was pretty good, if a bit slow. But to pay $30 for a pizza and salad (I split both with DP, but I probably could've eaten all of it myself) is a bit steep. I realize it's Sewickley, and maybe I shouldn't even try to rate places in this town lol."}
{"text":"This is a very small restaurant with an open kitchen and pizza oven.  The menu has some salads, pizzas and some pasta dishes on it.  

The seating area is comfy and with the garage door front open, it lends itself to additional outdoor seating as well.

The staff is very nice and accomodating, that's a plus.

As for the food - it's okay - not spectacular, not bad.  There are other options around that are so much better for specialty pizza and fresh pasta dishes.

On the downside - $8 cork fee for the BYOB.  

A three star review on Yelp is A-OK and a 2 star is \"meh, I've experienced better\".

Yes, no doubt we've experienced better and yes, Mambo Italia is A-OK, even with the $8 upcharge.  Maybe a 2.5 star if I could.

Can't tell you when we'd go back - if at all."}
{"text":"Very good food. Wife and I split meatballs, mambo pizza and penne vodka. Very good service. Had two seats at the counter. Was expecting a table or at least a heads up about counter seating. No big deal. $8 corkage seems higher than most BYOB's but still a lot less than buying 4-$12 glasses of wine. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Loved the decor and atmosphere!  The Arancini was great and would recommend.  The pizza was ok.  The flavor was good but the bottom crust (especially at the center of the pizza) was not crispy at all; could barely pick up the slices.  Server was friendly.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"Tried to eat here tonight, but didn't happen. There were tables (multiple) available, but only for parties of 3 or 4. When we pointed this out she again said no. Hostess refused to seat us in a table that sat 4 (with no wait - we walked right in and saw reservation list that was empty)."}
{"text":"I found this great little place in Sewickley and I was very excited to try it out. I called to see if Mambo took reservations. A man answers and says he put me down for a reservation. We get to the restaurant and the hostess informs us they don't take reservations. I asked well \"then who answered the phone and took the reservation?\" \"Oh\", she replies there are 2 restaurants with the same number. Very weird I thought, but still proceeded to put my name down. It's a very nice atmosphere the food smelled delicious. 

 As we stood and waited we noticed 4-5 open tables and 3 parties ahead of us. The hostesses were literally walking around in circles, not sure what was happening. 2 parties were seated and soon it was us and another couple waiting. Then it was us and the other couple left standing while people just walking in got tables because they had a party of 4. The hostess told my bf that it was the policy that 2 people can't sit at a table that holds 4 people. Funny, there wasn't one table in there that was for only 2 people. So we would have NEVER been seated this evening due to the people all coming in for a late dinner. We left after witnessing how unorganized this place was. I would not recommend this place to anyone I know. It's a shame the food smelled and looked great."}
{"text":"This place was very cute and delicious! My husband and I just moved here and we were walking through the little town and the good smells brought us in. We sat at the little bar area and got to watch the men make the pizzas! We got the Pepperoni rolls appetizer  and they were BOMB! I order some pasta (cant remember what is was called) husband ordered the margarita pizza and of course they were both delish! My favorite part was the tiramisu, best tiramisu I've ever had!!! We will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite places in Sewickley! Great pizza and the bolognese is to die for. BYOB with a small cork fee."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service, and a great location. 

For our first time there, I tried the tagliatelle bolognese (yeah, I probably spelled that wrong), and it was excellent! The portion sizes are appropriate (not too large) to finish in a single meal and the food was fresh and tasty. I look forward to returning."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the area by far.  Very authentic Italian.  Great atmosphere and service.  Wife and I had margarita pizza and kids had chicken alfredo.   The wood-fired pizza was amazing."}
