{"text":"Angie's offers very good home-cooked Italian food.  Prices are reasonable and you can bring your own bottle.   The atmosphere is extremely casual.  The owner/chief will usually stop by the table to see if you are enjoying the meal."}
{"text":"I've been going to Angie's for years. Small family place with excellent homemade Italian food. My favorites include the eggplant parm, anything with sausage and meatballs, spinach & cheese Stromboli. It's all good and the owners are always nice. Atmosphere is a little dated, but makes you feel like you're in Grandma's kitchen. Works for me."}
{"text":"Very good food at great prices. There are reasons why they been there since 1987!
My daughter and I had pizza today and only one slice was left! That never happens! Looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"I love heading down to Angie's for some great Italian food. I'm a big fan of the meatball hoagie, chicken parm and really anything else they serve. Joe and Kathy are awesome and it's a great intimate place to just enjoy a thoughtful meal."}
{"text":"I didn't have a great experience. I have had worse, but there are better options minutes away.

The service was slow, and the kitchen matched its pace. They said more than once they were having a bad night. It's hard to say if they were missing staff or what, but they didn't work it out.

- Soups came out late - so late they gave us bowls as a free upgrade. But it was too cold to be appetizing. They offered to replace the cold soup with another side. 
- Spinach rolls were ok, not great but the high point of the meal. (Check out Veltre's for a much tastier version.)
- A while after we were done with soups and app, the chef came over to let us know entrees were going to be out in 15 min. When they came, the alfredo was cold - it tasted better microwaved the next day - and the veal parm was not breaded. It was edible, but not at all what I expect when I order veal parm. 

Overall the experience was nothing I hope to repeat. I think I will give them another shot at some point, maybe my experience was an unfortunate fluke."}
