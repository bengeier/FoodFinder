{"text":"Great vegan food, and amazing service! We had Copper Branch cater for an event, and the food was exceptional and was very well received. Would recommend if you want to try out some high-quality, diverse, vegan food in the area!"}
{"text":"My first time trying out Copper Branch. I shared the vegan poutine and smoked tofu sandwich with a friend. The taste of the poutine sauce reminded me alot of curry and was tasty but definitely different.   However, I find the smoked tofu sandwich to be a bit bland and too sweet to my taste ( because of the sweet potato). Overall, it was a good experience, the staff was very friendly. Will definitely come back to try other stuff from their menu."}
{"text":"Terrible service. There were only two rather clueless employees working, who couldn't keep up with any of the orders. A long line of clientele formed, and no one was served before twenty minutes of waiting. Get it together!"}
{"text":"Terrible!  J'y suis allé avec une collègue pour le lunch. Commande de ma collègue : erreur sur la facture, ils lui ont chargé un brownie supplémentaire. Nous avions pris les plats pour emporter. Quand nous sommes arrivés à nos bureaux, nous nous apprêtons à déguster le tout : le pain à burger est tellement détrempé qu'il se défait par lui-même. Ma commande : D'abord, je précise que je vais prendre pour emporter, on me la sert comme plat à consommer sur place. (Ce qui de prime à bord n'est pas si tragique) mais quand je mentionne que je l'ai demandé pour emporter, on me fait une attitude de M**** en me disant : sur la facture c'est écrit pour manger ici... Finalement, on me l'emballe rapidement et on me \" garoche \" mes trucs, sans même me donner de sac... (Encore là vous allez me dire qu'il n'y a rien là, je suis d'accord mais, ce qui suit, est à mon avis inacceptable). J'ai pris un burger et des frites, avant de quitter, je souhaite mettre du poivre sur lesdites frites, car moi j'aime ça mettre du poivre sur mes frites et j'estime qu'à près de 20$ pour un burger et des frites si je veux du satané de poivre sur mes frites j'ai le droit d'en demander et ils se doivent de m'en fournir....Ça ben beau est un resto grano, du poivre ça ne vient pas d'un être possédant des yeux. Donc, j'en demande... On me dit \" S'il en n'a pas là, c'est qu'on a n'a pas! \" Fin!  Ne prennent pas la peine de me dire : \" deux minutes, je vais aller voir si nous en avons derrière.... \"Et je tiens à dire ici, que la même attitude de M*** mentionnée ci-haut est toujours présente. (J'apprends plus tard que cette personne est en fait la super propriétaire. Pour le reste de l'histoire cette personne sera surnommée joie de vivre.  Bref,  nous arrivons à nos bureaux et première bouchée : je passe près de tout recracher, car ce n'est pas ce que j'ai commandé. J'avais demandé pour le Burger aux patates douces et j'ai eu le je sais pu quoi \" Burger Gala...\", mais visiblement fait d'un ingrédient qui ne passe pas... Nous décidons donc de retourner sur place, car c'est impossible que je mange ce burger.  C'est Joie-de-vivre qui nous accueille. Nous lui disons ce qui cloche avec nos commandes : le pain détrempé. Pour eux c'est normal, c'est comme ça que ça vient. Point. Si ça t'écure du pain détrempé c'est to bad. MANGE ! Tu as commandé ça, c'est ça que ta, tu perds le droit d'exprimer ton mécontentement. Donc, ma collègue a eu le droit seulement de se faire rembourser le brownie de trop qui lui avait été chargé. Moi, on me dit sur ta facture c'est écrit \" burger Gala...\", je m'en fou, je sais que ce n'est pas cela que j'ai demandé, car j'ai pris la peine de consulter votre menu avant de venir et dans aucune langue le mot \" Patates douces \" ressemble à \" Gala.... \". Bref, on me rembourse de peine et misère ledit burger, mais on oubli pour les frites, car c'est ce que j'ai commandé, c'est ce que j'ai, j'ai donc perdu le droit d'exprimer mon mécontentement vis-à-vis les frites (qui depuis le temps, sont pas mal rendues froides, même très froides, donc pas très mangeables). Bref, tout ça pendant qu'une manifestation à lieu, et pendant que j'attends pour le remboursement Joie-de-vivre cri après les manifestants, quand Joie-de-vivre finit de crier après les manifestants elle s'exprime sur les québécois et à quel point ce sont de mauvaises personnes et de personnes chialeuses .... Toujours au même moment, ma collègue reçoit un snapchat, le regarde et Joie-de-vivre pense qu'elle est en train de prendre une photo. Ma collègue lui dit que ce n'est pas ce qu'elle est en train de faire. Joie-de-vivre tape sur le téléphone de ma collègue, comme pour cacher l'écran. (Ma collègue va même jusqu'à lui montrer les photos qu'elle a dans son cellulaire et Joie-de-vivre lui dit carrément que c'est une menteuse). J'ai finalement mon remboursement (seulement le burger) et comme par magie il y a maintenant du poivre sur le comptoir. Vous savez le poivre qu'il n'avait pas quelques minutes plus tôt. J'Imagine que Joie-de-vivre est sorti en acheter entre nos deux visites. Bref, je suis très souvent dans les restos,  et j'en ai eu des histoires étranges et de mauvais services, mais celui-ci gagne haut la main la médaille d'or !"}
{"text":"C'était ma première expérience chez Copper Branch et j'ai été choqué de voir le caissier une fois que j'ai payé ma commande se diriger directement vers le comptoir ou il s'est mis à preparer mon hamburger sans se laver les mains ni mettre de gants!!  J'ai été tellement degouté que j'ai demandé à ce qu'il annule ma commande et qu'il me rembourse avant de quitter en jurant de ne plus revenir dans ce restaurant."}
{"text":"Vegan, Gluten free, Organic and no MSG fast food joint.   The staff who was at the counter to take orders was polite, friendly and helpful.    I had Mushroom galaxy burger $7.95 and house-baked Fries $ 3.45.   Portion: Burger was satisfying enough that I regretted that I ordered the fries, since the fries were pretty big (not super size big, but quite big.)   Taste: I liked the burger, and the fries were a bit too salty (they were served already salted.)    I found it a bit disturbing that they use cardboard containers to serve their food. They have a recycling station where you return containers after you are done, bu I wonder if they can really recycle those food stained cardboard containers with the recycling program of the City of Montreal.  The burger was wrapped in a waxed paper like paper which was a problem because the burger cannot keep its shape while I was eating it, since the mushrooms slip out from between the top and bottom slices of the bun. It gets messy, so a plate and fork and knife may be a good idea."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch based on all the hyped recommendations but we were hugely disappointed. We ordered the quinoa breakfast bowl and waffles.  The servings were small, waffles were not warm and lacked substance. Only positive was the good coffee. I wouldn't come here again...sorry. I'm a big fan of the healthy-clean food revolution, Copper fails at it."}
{"text":"In my opinion the Southwest scramble is the best vegan breakfast in Montreal. I'm thrilled that they now serve breakfast all day! I love the Copper Branch chain, I hope they take over the world :D"}
{"text":"The good was good and delivered fast.  I didn't know how good vegetarian food could taste."}
{"text":"Stayed in Montreal for one night, so googled, and stumbled on this place.  Since both my husband and I are vegetarians, we were quite excited it was a short walk from the hotel.  The person working there was nice enough, and did offer an English menu and his recommendations when we asked.    However, there was a hair in one of the burgers (never a good thing!), and the Einstein shake did not look anything like the picture and was nothing special.  Tastewise, the burgers were okay - I've had better, but it could be worse.  And then, to top it off, we could not even wash it down with water, because the water was a bit mirky and had things floating in both glasses.  For a burger, it is pricey, because the portions are rather small.  Nice concept, but definitely needs work."}
{"text":"Great healthy meals. Amazing flavors!! Friendly service. open late"}
{"text":"Me and my family are staying in Montreal for a few days, and we needed a quick, casual, and vegan place to have dinner. Copper Branch was the closest option, so we decided to eat here.  The food was very good. The service was super quick as well! Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Mushroom poutine was great. Breakfast tofu sandwich a little bland. Would def go back"}
{"text":"Quinoa bowls - perfect pre-race fuel for Montreal Dragon Boat Challenge!  Not only really good food, but Daniel!  Best, most charming, most helpful counter person ever!"}
{"text":"Was greeted when I walked in, menu on the wall is in French so had to use a paper menu but no big deal. Staff was overall really nice. The food came really quick - I just got the General Copper. The sauce was spot on and everything tasted fresh. No need for soy sauce. Reminded me of some of the spots in LA. Will be coming back."}
{"text":"Forever three stars:  It's like I went to McDonalds but its shareholders converted to veganism and health foods.   It's all reheated stuff from the freezer but it's good reheated stuff from the freezer.  The beverages look fanciful and trendy. The tea was okay.  If I was hungry for fast, healthy, light and semi-cheapish food for its category, this would be my top option.  Just don't forget this is a healthy fast food joint and not a true restaurant and you will be fine."}
{"text":"Super friendly, helpful staff. I had the poutine and my friend got the Aristotle bowl. Food was tasty, but I think I would be kidding myself if I thought this place was low-cal/low-fat/healthy. Sure, it's \"healthier\" because at least you get a lot more veggies than you would typically get in a meal, but there is an abundance of oil in the bowl and I really don't see how the poutine fries are baked and not deep-fried! (Still felt fairly heavy). It's a good option if you really want vegan and you're downtown, but it feels like a poor imitation of Aux Vivres -- and it's not nearly as charming or vibrant."}
{"text":"Good healthy food. The Asia fusion bowl is great.  Service is pretty slow at the counter.  But worth the wait"}
{"text":"My daughters and I have a new favorite spot!  It is so nice to have a place where we can get wholesome and tasty  vegetarian dishes.  Their Aztec dish is delicious and their homemade fries also got the spot.  The staff at this location are also really great.  We love it!"}
{"text":"I LOVED the tofu scramble breakfast sandwich!!!!! I'm so excited the west island has vegan options and they're so yummy!!! I hope this place thrives!! And stays for good!!!!  can't wait to go back and try a burger!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious spicy black bean burger and fries.   Fresh and yummy.   Great atmosphere inside with blonde wood tables and stools.  Nice place to relax with friends over a day/mid-day meal."}
{"text":"Delicious vegan food with a great selection. Mediterranean power bowl is out of sight and the quinoa chili was total yum!"}
{"text":"5 stars for making healthy taste this good! Love the ambiance of the place as well. Only wish there were more locations in Toronto!"}
{"text":"I'm a meat eater!  However, I find that this vegan \"fast food\" restaurant is quite good.    The Asian Fusion bowl is packed with great flavour and a good amount food to fill you up even though it's all vegetables!  I even enjoyed the \"fake protein\" in it (it's all about the sauce).  I also tried the Copper Burger, kind of odd seeing a \"beet\" burger, in no way does it taste like meat...but it was very good as a sandwich...just don't call it a burger ;)  Everything was fresh and very well presented!  Prices vary between $8 - $12.  I can't believe I'm saying this...but I will definitely be back even though I would normally grab a burger from a fast food joint!  Give it a try and don't let the \"vegan\" scare you off, think of it as \"tasty HEALTHY fast food joint\" instead!"}
{"text":"Great vegan place on the plateau. My favourite item on the menu is certainly the aztec bowl. Yes, prices are a bit high but considering the quality of the food I don't think it's exaggerated.   My only complain is that they seem short-staffed during the evenings so you might have to wait little bit more than the usual for your order."}
{"text":"Great food. Modern decor. Friendly service. Healthy. Can't ask for more. New build in Brooklin right downtown. There's no place like this in Brooklin and is a breath of fresh air!"}
{"text":"Amazing vegan vegetarian cuisine...delicious, fresh and healthy...what more can one ask for. We had the sweet potatoe and beet burger and the \"chicken\" sandwich with baked fries and everything was amazing"}
{"text":"As other reviewers have said I'm grateful that this option exists in the West Island. It's in in a convenient location and the staff are very friendly and knowledgeable. The desserts are fantastic especially the zucchini bread brownies!  As for the main dishes it was at bit of a miss.  For example let's take the fries - I'm not sure what spices/coating they used but it did not work at all for me. My advice? Don't try to get creative with a cornerstone side dish like fries.  My wife and I will definitely go back to try other dishes but for now we're in no rush.  Sorry if my review sounds negative I just really want this place to work"}
{"text":"I was excited at the prospect of having a vegan option in the TMR/Saint-Laurent area. Unfortunately, it did not meet my expectations.   The first time I went, we got the Aztec bowl and the black-bean burger. Bowl was very underwhelming, but the burger was okay. Second visit: galaxy burger (portobello mushroom was really difficult to bite into, and the whole burger did not taste very good), Aristotle bowl (meh) and side of fries (a burnt, soggy mess - and I'm not picky with fries!). Not going back.  This place lost another star because of an employee interaction. On our way out the first time, an employee asked if we'd had the galaxy burger because that one was really good. We said we'd try it another time. When we order it from the same employee on our second visit, and we mention the initial recommendation, this person says that he'd never tried the burger. \"I wouldn't know. I don't eat at restaurants. It's not healthy.\" Seems like an odd thing to say to a customer."}
{"text":"Ordered from ALaCarte and included tip in the payment and then when the guy came we had to pay tip on the card machine so we ended up double tipping and paying $30 for two so-so burgers.  I would've been okay if it at least came with fries or a salad or a drink but nope. Just two small burgers that we're way over on the dry side.  I've definitely had better $15 burgers."}
{"text":"I felt mistreated when I arrived there in the weekend that just past. At the time it was a man and a women who work there. I asked if everything in the restaurant was vegan and the guy told me no with no smiles on his face but the girl(Server is Jessica. I got her name from my receipt) said yes. The guy rolled his eyes when she said yes. I look at Copper Branch on the net before but I couldn't remember if it said that it is 100% vegan. I was looking for another vegan restaurant but I got lost so that's how i end up at Copper Branch. I'm brown (multiracial) and they're brown too but i'm one or two shades darker. I felt that he lied because of my skin color. His reaction tells me that he heard me right because if he hadn't, he wouldn't be upset when she told me that everything is vegan. I think he didn't want me to be a regular at that restaurant. Well i'm not coming back there and I might boycott other Copper Branches (the jesus inside me don't want me to do that). Too bad because their MUSHROOM GALAXY BURGER is so good!. I added tofu slices to it. What makes things worse is that the girl was coughing so much without wearing a mask or at least covering her mouth with the inside of her arm. I kept watching her when she coughed so I think she got the clue and I also watch her to make sure that she didn't cough on my food. She did a little cough when she was preparing my order and I hope that wasn't over my food and that my food was sealed at the time. I didn't like the disgust/dirty look she gave me when I asked her a question after getting my food. Her back was turned and she thought I was someone else. She quickly took off the disgust look and pretend to be nice. the girl had no smiles on her face.i only asked if the menu was free.they obviously both have a problem with my skin color. I prayed over my food to Jesus to get rid of any germs and such. In general I don't care if the people who serve me hate me for whatever reason but I care if they coughed, pick nose or whatever while preparing my food. As i'm writing this I feel a cough coming on so I'll have to stop and pray. In another scenario I was thinking maybe in this case the guy is the good one who sees that the restaurant don't use only vegan ingredients. Most of the minorities in Canada want to be accepted by the majority(whites) so much that they'll go extra miles to discriminate against you if you're a minority. Even your own family will discriminate against you or treat you like you're lesser than. I had so many bad experiences in shops and restaurants from both whites and minorities that I stop shopping like I use to for around 10 years. Sometimes I feel like just leaving this planet forever :(."}
{"text":"As a vegetarian for many years, this has got to be the best vegan poutine I've had thus far! Everything I've had has been so good (spicy black bean burger, general Copper bowl, and the hot wings - all excellent) but this poutine is awesome!"}
{"text":"Delicious vegan food but over priced. Good for a bite every once in a while. Especially great burgers!"}
{"text":"Super, extra restaurant végétarien!!! Nourriture fraiche, inventive et délicieuse! Les employés gentils, courtois et nous conseillent sur les combinaisons gagnantes de leurs plats. J'ai adoré et j'y retourne sans faute et j'en parle à tous mes amis!:)))))"}
{"text":"Great food, great concept, great service! I'm a fan of copper branch and have been for awhile, just wanted to recognize the great service I had at Copper Branch on Bishop. I was greeted quickly and one of the employees, I think her name was Emma, answered all of my tedious questions about the menu with pleasure."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by this place. Felt like a chain but they have some amazing vegan food. The 2 burgers are a must have. The vegan waffles were a little dry but the sauce and fruit preserves we're excellent. Fries werent as crispy as I would have imagined but overall a must try restaurant. Street parking only but fairly close to Guy Concordia metro"}
{"text":"I've gone to this Copper Branch many times and the service is quick and efficient. Love being able to choose anything on the menu (I'm allergic to dairy and don't eat meat).  I've had the poutine, the quinoa chili and the copper branch burger.  The poutine and quinoa chili are delicious. The burger is good, but for the price you pay it's pretty expensive. You have maybe 5 bites and you're done."}
{"text":"Love love love this place. Can't even count the number of times we've ordered delivery from copper branch. I'm tried everything from burgers to bowls, shakes and desserts. My favorite has got to be the \"chicken\" teriyaki sandwich (made with shiitake mushroom) and their chocolate zucchini brownie . The sandwich is amazing, the texture of shiitake mushroom taste just like, if not better than regular chicken. & the chocolate zucchini brownie, probably the best brownie I've ever had in my life. Its so rich but not overly sweet, and for $4 a piece, please just go try it.    The prices are also very reasonable, the sandwiches burgers are around $8-$10 while bowls are $11-$14 (also comes in mini)."}
{"text":"Friendly service. Everybody was so helpful with the huge menu and all the choices! The recommended the shiitake teriake sandwhich and it was really good. I got it on a collard wrap because I don't eat bread, and I love that they have that option! really tasty, will come back again next time I'm in town"}
{"text":"So happy for this place! I'm from San Diego, visiting my sister and was so happy to find this organic,  plant-based gem! I wasn't sure how the food would taste it was awesome! My sister who doesn't usually eat very healthy loved it as well! Will definitely go back before I leave! Ps. It's super cute inside!"}
{"text":"My husband and I found this little restaurant during our visit to Montreal. I'm not vegan, but he is, and even I found their food to be quite appetizing! The staff was welcoming and very helpful. I've only got great things to say about this place. We'll definitely be visiting during our next visit :) the black bean burger is AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"Burger was very bland, lacked seasoning. This is a mediocre choice amongst the vegan places in Montreal. One positive was the brownie!"}
{"text":"The food is completely vegan and I think I remember seeing gluten free options as well. The place was clean and quiet, which was great. Parking was easily accessible, which was also great. The food seems extremely pricey, but I guess that's the compromise."}
{"text":"I cannot possibly say enough wonderful things about Copper Branch at the 444 Rene-Levesque location.    I just ate there for 5 straight nights.  For a couple of reasons:  1) The team was amazing.  Genuinely some of the nicest and most helpful people that you will meet.  The take the time to answer your questions and help meet the various needs that you may have.    2) I do not eat foods with onions and garlic and they were able to prepare meals for me that met this dietary restriction and they were very happy to do so.  It was not a burden for them, they genuinely wanted me to have a good experience.    3) You can tell that the restaurant was very cleanly and the staff works diligently to represent the Copper Branch brand very well.    4) This could very well be higher on this list, but the people are so good that I wanted to give them preference, but the food was great!  Overall, if you want a place where you can have a good meal from people that will treat everyone right, then this is your spot.    The team here is a great role model for the rest of the food service industry.  A big, heartfelt thank you to William and the rest of the team!  Keep up the great work and I am rooting and praying for your success!"}
{"text":"I had the shitaki teriyaki burger and a side of poutine. The burger was amazing, great texture and not dry at all. If I had just gotten the burger, this review would be 5/5. However, I'm giving this place 3/5 because the poutine was very dry, it could have had much more sauce. Also, the only condiments offered once you got your food were hot sauce, salt, and pepper. The hot sauce was not spicy at all. Also important to note: this place is fast food and located in the CIBC centre in a food court. The diverse menu made it seem like it was a sit down place. Hard to find if you've never been before."}
{"text":"A clean restaurant on Rene Levesque next to Starbucks. I got the Aristotle power bowl, with a brown rice base and shitake teriyaki as protein. The cost was 14.36. I took advantage of it being slow because this place is usually packed. Now I'm the only customer."}
{"text":"Fast-food vegetarian  Priced right, good food. I am not the vegetarian type but had to try this and found everything was tasty.  The burger  could have been served a little warmer.  First time in and expect to come back soon for more experience."}
{"text":"Bean burger is super yum!!!! Normally ppl might think its spicy but if u like spicy this will be a nice mildly spicy burger.  Aztec bowl is rly good with shitaki Poutine didn't even taste vegan so bonus points for that!"}
{"text":"Cadre très sympa idéal pour travailler tranquille choix de plats végétaux très cool moi même j'essaie le galaxy burger avec une drink kombucha rise ginger le Burger est fait devant vous cuisson direct mais le Burger est bien ordinaire et les morceaux de champignons et salade très gros"}
{"text":"You'd think a joint specialized in serving vegetables would know how to properly prepare greens. But when I took a bite out of my lukewarm portobello cabbage wrap, my teeth screeched on some sand. Yeah you read it right"}
{"text":"Love the food.  Great location. Normally give 5 stars for Copper Branch but service is the slowest at this branch."}
{"text":"Amazing salads. Burgers are great but expensive and you need 2 to fill full. Poutine is ok , fries are not fried thus making for less than a good poutine. Sauce is good and fake cheese is passable. Wish there were more tables, this place is hopping at lunch. Never had a problem with any employee"}
{"text":"WARNING. -   Copper Branch will steal your money and time!   Placed order online, you charged my wife's credit card, I got the car from the hotel, went to pick up the food.  The restaurant was closed, although the sign said it was to open at 7am, and the app charged me for the order.  Went back to hotel, paid $10 to repark the car.  Spent an hour looking for a phone number to call to reverse the fraudulent charge.  Finally talked to Leo, who offered us nothing but said he would refund the charge.  THE CHARGE HAS STILL NOT BEEN REFUNDED!"}
{"text":"Finally...someone capitalized on the fact that vegetarians are NOT averse to fast food, just to meat! I had the poutine; it was entirely vegan and the chef was NOT stingy on the sauce, like other Montreal poutine hotspots tend to be. My friend had the Galaxie burger, which he enjoyed tremendously (and admitted he was expecting NOT to!) and fries, and these were well-seasoned, golden and plentiful! We topped dinner off with a zucchini chocolate brownie that was seriously delicious...moist and rich...and coffees (Americano) that were flavourful and not at all watered-down like some healthy food restaurant coffee tends to be. It was such a great experience to look at all the yummy items on the menu and realize we could select anything since everything is vegan! We're going back...the healthy Bowls are calling!"}
{"text":"After comming in an announcing to her I have never been here before and am just looking for a quick bite and a coffee , she gives me the menu.  There was nothing that I wanted so I just got a coffee 4 bucks for 16oz .... I go to put in cream and sugar only to find out they don't have any ... So I ask and she says they are vegan. I said well I don't want a coffee with no cream or sugar , and she says well it's posted outside we are vegan. I said ok well you know I've never been here before and you should've told me before you gave me the coffee and I paid that there was no cream.   She wouldn't refund me and just kept saying they are vegan.    *update* customer service reached out to me , and rectified the situation. I'm gonna say whoever I dealt with was probably just having a shit day."}
{"text":"Went for vegan lunch with my cousins who are not vegans, and they loved it. The shitake mushroom terriyaki is INCREDIBLE- taste and texture makes you think you are eating meat, but you aren't. Really fresh, interesting menu, clean, nice location. Awesome Patio to sit in the sun! Feels healthy and not heavy at all. we got Nachos, copper bowl, beet burger, and collard wrap. It was super busy which is always great to see for a new restaurant, and, nice to promote ethical food choices :)"}
{"text":"Qu'on ne me dise plus qu'on n'arrive pas à avoir assez de goût sans viande ! Quelle délice ces puissances végétales (qui portent bien leur nom) et pour un rapport qualité/prix raisonnable ma petite dame !  Petit bémol par contre.. pour rester à fond dans le bio/vegan/meilleur pour la planète pourquoi ne pas montrer le bon exemple et faire encore moins d'emballage ? (Un sachet à emporter n'est pas nécessaire avec la boite en carton, selon moi ;-)"}
{"text":"I recently went to this location and ordered the Copper General Bowl. Just under $15 after taxes, and what a disappointment.  Tiny amount. A couple of small pieces of avacado and broc, a nice amount of mushrooms, and the smallest serving of rice I ever got in a restaurant.  I was very hungry after eating this. I don't think that for $15 I should be hungry. And I know rice is not that expensive, so why is Copper Branch so cheap with the rice?  I had it as a take out meal, and it was very nicely presented in a cardboard box that was placed in a classy looking Copper Branch bag. Pretty and slick. Both the box was only 25-30% full.  Copper Branch, can I have more food and less flash? I can't eat the box and bag, even though they are vegan."}
{"text":"Nous somme allés au Copper Branch un vendredi soir vers 20h. C'était presque plein, c'est-à-dire que les sept tables (plus ou moins) étaient presque toutes occupées. Comme c'est encore tout nouveau, la déco est très inspirée des dernières tendances: bois naturel, tuyauterie apparente, ampoules nues, rosaces sur les murs, plafond cuivré...   Au menu: sandwichs, burgers, soupes, bols (légumes, vinaigrette, etc. servi sur lit de riz ou de nouilles), desserts. Le tout sans viande ou sous-produit animal. Pour notre part, nous avons jeté notre dévolu sur les bols \"Aztec\" (style tex-mex avec guacamole, maïs, salsa, haricots noirs et tempeh) et \"Méditerranéo\" (style, vous l'avez deviné, méditerranéen avec aubergines, poivrons, tofu fumé, pois chiches et vinaigrette au basilic). Les deux étaient délicieux et très rassasiants. Du côté dessert, on a pris le brownie aux courgettes sans gluten qui était moelleux à souhait et absolument exquis et le muffin aux bananes et bleuets, sans gluten aussi, qui était aussi bon (mais j'ai préféré le brownie).  Côté service, ça se fait au comptoir, style cantine avec les traditionnels cabarets bruns. La préparation est assez rapide. Par contre, il n'y a pas d'ustensiles en métal, ni de verres en verre. C'est du plastique partout. Même les desserts étaient préemballés dans des coupes de plastique... Ça donne une drôle d'impression, surtout avec le beau décor tendance et la super bonne bouffe, de se faire servir dans du plastique.  Avec la prédominance du plastique, l'autre chose que je n'ai pas trop apprécié était le prix. Ça nous a coûté plus de 35$ pour nos deux bols et les deux desserts. On n'a même pas pris de breuvages. On n'était pas servis à table et on mangeait avec des ustensiles de plastique! Heureusement, nous avions un coupon de Groupon qui nous avait coûté 20$, avec les taxes, ça montait à environ 25$, ce que je trouve beaucoup plus raisonnable.  Bref, j'ai beaucoup aimé mon expérience gustative, mais, au risque de paraitre radine, je ne pense pas y retourner s'ils ne changent pas leurs prix ou leur concept cantine/plastique, à moins d'avoir à nouveau un coupon!"}
{"text":"This review is based on my first experience only.   The staff: definitely could have been more friendly. Maybe they had a really busy lunch service. Will forgive the slight attitude I received on this take out order.   Food I tried the Mushroom Galaxy Burger - oven roasted portobello mushroom, eggplant, caramelized onions, Swiss style 'cheese', lettuce and aioli.  It was DELICIOUS. Very flavourful and well seasoned. The soft sesame bun was super fresh.  For me a sign of good vegan/vegetarian food is that you don't miss the meat. This burger makes you forget that it's vegan.   Cost/Value My only gripe is, the cost. Like all vegan food, it's rather expensive. This small burger alone would definitely not be filling without a side. The burger is $10 after tax.  That being said, I'm excited to go back and try everything else on the menu!"}
{"text":"I love having a vegan fast casual place. However, I thought the prices here were really expensive for very small portions. My waffle was decent, but not crisp like it should be. The sandwich was also really bready. I might give it another try, but it's certainly not somewhere I would crave and purposely target for return."}
{"text":"The worst vegan food. Its like vegan fast food. I tried to eat twice at copper branch, and i wasnt impressed. I have tried a lot of vegan food in Mtl, and i was really disappointed. The prices are kind of unrealistic for what you get. The fries of the poutine were cold the sauce was sticky and cold and you get like 10 fries for 9$."}
{"text":"So I decided to order something healthy since I've been trying to keep fit and have fun body break ! I got a smoothie an energy bowl and the keftas. Now the star of this meal was the keftas ( which happened to be the most unhealthy ) they tasted almost like a falafel and I recommend you try em. I also got the the Aristotle small energy bowl and added the shiitake teriyaki which was great my least favourite part of this was the black olives as they were way to salty. And finally the smoothie I've eaten a lot in my life and I've had quite a few weird smoothies but this took the cake. Dawgs this was like the cinnamon challenge but with tumric. The smell from the straw was strong but the taste was something else I can stilll taste that tumric wayyyy to much for me but if you can do it hats off to you !"}
{"text":"This location of the chain that I have tried I love the most. It seems always so unbelievably fresh and tasty. Also being in the mall in Laval there's tons of free parking too. The service is always so fast !   I love that the place is always semi full and with the shopping mall there's lots of seating. The menu choices are great and same with the drinks. They have also tap water if you don't want to buy an expensive $3 or $4 drink.   I've tried the burgers and bowls which I love so much. As well the nachos. I dislike the poutine for the price it's a small cheap portion and not worth it. Very little cheese and fries.   If you buy a bowl get a mini if you aren't blessed with a huge appetite or share a regular sized between two people ! Also I'd suggest shiitake mushrooms as the base and I love the Aztec !"}
{"text":"Delicious food, healthy food, amazingly friendly staff. Best meal I had in on my trip home."}
{"text":"I tried their flagship \"Copper Burger\" as it was recommended by their staff as the best of their burgers.  The burger was better than your average veggie burger, but was a bit mushy and kind of extruded as I ate it. The toppings were tasty but unsubstantial.  It could have used more toppings like tomatoes for example. The burger was quite small in size, which was disappointing for a $9 burger with no sides included.  There were caramelized onions on the burger, which would have been good had they not included the tough onion skin in my sandwich (which any competent restaurant would remove).  Better than your average veggie burger - but for the price and quantity, it's not worth it, so I wouldn't eat there again."}
{"text":"Just recently found this place and I am beyond impressed! Absolutely love the decor, ambiance, food and service."}
{"text":"This place was a gem for me in Montreal. I was working at a hotel just down the street and the menu looked pretty healthy with a diverse selection of items. I can't tell you how surprised I was by their flavors. I tried a couple of dishes during my stay and I can't say I was disappointed by any of them. The prices were reasonable, the portions were solid, what more can you ask for? Definitely check it out! There's something for everyone!"}
{"text":"I was visiting Montreal this past summer and decided to stop here since it was advertised as a vegan dining joint, and I was very satisfied.  I went here to try their breakfast menu, ordering a tofu scramble sandwich with jalapeno peppers, which came with a vegan mozzarella cheese spread, and it was excellent.  I was surprised, because normally I don't enjoy vegan cheese, but I genuinely consider this the best I've ever tasted.  We came back for dessert at night, and their vegan cookies and brownies are equally delicious.    The service is great, the location is beautiful and very clean and comfortable inside, it's convenient to either stop and dine in or take out on the go, and the servers really know what they're doing.  My parents actually had a chance to talk with one of the workers and he was very friendly and willing to explain how they sourced the food and how they made different things.    Overall, a must-try experience for vegans and non-vegans alike who happen to be in the Montreal area."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here on our way back to the states for a filling yummy meal and we were not disappointed! I had the Aristotle with carrot keftedes (like spicy carrot fastballs, so good!) and my  husband had the bean and sweet potato burger, then we split a poutine. The gravy on the poutine was peppery and savory, really good, doesn't even need the dairy free cheese! Service was fast and helpful, and the food was fresh and generous. So happy to see another vegan option in this forward thinking city!"}
{"text":"Je rejoins les avis de beaucoup... Copper Branch c'est très bon, mais le service est excessivement mauvais. Aucun employé ne semble comprendre correctement le français, ils ne comprennent rien mais ne le disent pas en vous regardant l'air ahuri. C'est lent et ils ne connaissent pas leur menu.  Mais bon, comme on se régale vraiment, même si c'est cher, on y revient quand même, tant pis pour le service..."}
{"text":"Vegan poutine, enough said!!! A little bit expensive but the quality was good enough for me to justify the price. I also got the mushroom galaxy burger which was delicious. It can be really difficult to travel while accommodating a vegan diet so I am super grateful this place was close to my hotel. Plenty of places to sit and lots of food options to choose from on the menu :)"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed lunch at this fast food vegan chain. The quality of the food was excellent. I am visiting from San Francisco and heard of you on Happy Cow. Instead of a main I ordered three side plates:  Poutine w/portobello mushroom sauce and Daiya cheese, Carrot Keftedes (Greek style meatballs made with carrots) w/aïoli and a Chico Salad. The portions were very large!  I could not finish the poutine!  Everything was so delicious!  Remember to get a \"frequent user\" card to earn credit whenever you eat there!"}
{"text":"Delicious and flavourful food! You must try it! I absolutely love the General Tao. Takes exactly like beef! Amazing service and they are very quick if you're in a rush."}
{"text":"I've tried their salad bowls, quinoa chili, shiitake teriyaki sandwich and chocolate zucchini brownie. I haven't had a bad experience yet.  Love their outdoor patio during the warm weather. Perfect to get your tan on during lunch time."}
{"text":"We came here and got take out last night,and loved it!!!!!!! Me and my husband both had the Bowls.  I had the Asian Fusion bowl and he had aztec. Was great how we could choose our carb, and out protein. The meal was so fresh,filling and delicious! Glad Brooklin has a place like this. We just moved here from Toronto and have been looking for a place like this. We will for sure be back !"}
{"text":"Tellllleeement bon ! Si vous aimez le fast food vegan, c'est pour vous ! Je ne comprend pas pourquoi il n'y a pas plus d'étoiles  J'ai pris un sandwich au shitaké et c'était délicieux ! J'ai hâte d'essayer le reste du menu !"}
{"text":"I realize this location has only been open a short time and I'm extremely grateful that this option is even available on the West Island, however I respectfully have a few suggestions. As far as ambience is concerned, the room needs some kind of music. It was a bit awkward sitting there amidst silence. The food was good but needs a little pizzazz. We ordered the Bombay soup in it's large size option. I wanted the soup first and unfortunately I didn't really get it that way. Also it could have been served hotter. The flavor was good and it was a generous portion for $4.95. My niece and I both had the Galaxy burger which is a portabello based item. We had it without the cheese since I am not a fan of vegan cheese and I asked for no aioli. The lovely young lady behind the counter insisted I try the wasabi mayo on the burger. There was way too much and I did not taste any wasabi. Not a big deal but the burger needs some crunch and is very wet to eat comfortably. Also it is served alone on a plate just a bit larger then the burger. I would rather pay a couple of dollars more and have it served on a larger plate with a side salad. I will give this place another shot on my next visit to Montreal to see if a little time under it's belt will improve the  smooth flow I would have liked to see here."}
{"text":"Amazing place!  The food is delicious,  great variety and great presentation, as well as the establishment... will most definitely be returning there !"}
{"text":"Ma première rencontre avec Copper Branch n'a pas été optimale.  Malgré la qualité des produits et le fait que les burgers étaient bons, j'ai trouvé la note de 30$ un peu salée pour deux burgers de taille petite-moyenne et une grande frite.  C'est vrai que les burgers sont bons et je suis content d'avoir une option végétalienne à proximité de chez moi maintenant!  Je reviendrais pour tester les autres propositions de repas aussi car malgré tout c'était très bon."}
{"text":"I'd read mixed reviews of Copper Branch but I had a great experience at their restaurant on Ste-Catherine near Atwater (I've been told to avoid the one in the Alexis Nihon food court). Pricey but yummy. I had a vegetable sandwich - loved the caramelised onions and 'cheese', and my omnivore boyfriend had the poutine and a mushroom burger. The poutine wasn't great in his opinion but the burger was good. I'm very glad that Montreal has its own vegan fast food chain and if I lived in the city, I'd be back for sure."}
{"text":"I decided to try this restaurant today despite some poor reviews online. The reviews were fairly consistent: OK food, pricy, and restaurant is dirty. Had to try for myself and my experience was exactly the same. The food was OK. I enjoyed the Copper Burger but the oven baked fries were soggy and way too salty. $45 for 2 burgers and drinks and a shared side order of fries.   The problem is that every free table in the restaurant hadn't been wiped clean and crumbs and food residues from previous meals still covered them. You can't put your hands - let alone your food on a table without cleaning it yourself. Dirty dishes and uneaten food covered the counters. (I noticed a lot of leftover fries. Maybe too salty for others?)  The restaurant wasn't busy and there were two staff working so I find this pretty inexcusable. I'd love to eat their food again but the management needs to start taking these comments seriously to get my business again."}
{"text":"Awesome experience with this location. I previously reviewed the downtown location after a horrible experience and thought I'd try some takeout as I drove home from Pointe-Claire. Restaurant was clean (a big difference from the other location). Food was prepared quickly and was delicious.   This location is doing something right and I recommend!"}
{"text":"My cousin told me about a plant based restaurant in Brooklin she wanted to check out. Plant based in Brooklin?? I was officially intrigued. If you don't know Brooklin, it's the northern part of Whitby that doesn't want to admit it's a part of Whitby.    We headed up to see what Copper Branch is all about. Parked on the road and headed in. It has a nice big patio, but it was raining that day, so it was the day to be indoors in their bright dining area. Everything is white and accented with classy accents and art. There were regular tables as well as high tops, long enough to hold multiple groups.    There is no table service, so you order at the cash and have a seat. Good luck picking something. Your best bet is to grab a paper menu and have a seat instead of standing there awkwardly(like me) while the line behind you grows hangry....and there WILL be a line. Cousin and I just beat the rush. It went from a few tables take to a huge line and almost no seating.  I got a Cappuccino and she got a Chai Latte to drink. They also have Vegan Bailey's which I didn't know existed, but they were out. My cousin had originally ordered a drink with Vegan Bailey's and someone went to pick more up, but after 15min of waiting, she picked changed her order to the Chai Latte....which I will be ordering next time. So rich, so creamy, so chai!   I went with the Spicy Black Bean Burger and she had the Southwest Wrap Scramble. I love black bean burgers and this one did not disappoint. It had a gentle curry kick and all of the vegan goodness that fills you up. So flavourful! My cousin, who is what you would call 'picky', loved the wrap. Great seasoning! She said that she would never have known it was tofu, if no one told her. The texture and flavour was on point. Well done! We didn't opt for a dessert; they were small and a little pricy. They are located in the cooler with the drinks, if you've got room!  The service was enthusiastic. Everyone there is knowledgeable and appear to enjoy helping the newbies find their way(which I truly appreciate). Excellent quality of ingredients, as well. I'd definitely go back!   I assure you, the plants are way more afraid of us than we are of them."}
{"text":"Awesome franchise.    That is coming from someone who avoids them like the plague.    Non-GMO food at affordable prices.  Much of it is GF.  Aztec bowl had oodles of fresh ingredients.  Asked for low sodium and cashier stated they don't add additional salt to their food.  Super impressed.    The icy smoothies could be better but they do the trick.  Try the ghandi, it's the most green, sub the oj with half water-less sweet and calories.    Wish CB was in the states.  Would choose this over all others.  This is going to be our go-to for the rest of the trip.  Very nice change in a meat-centric Montreal.    For two: $21  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Best. Burger. Ever. The Shiitake burger is absolutely amazing. The organic teriyaki sauce is to die for. Get one asap!"}
{"text":"New vegan restaurant opened just south of Ste Cat, on Bishop--it's been open about a week and I've had 6 different people on Yelp and Facebook ask me about it... So here's the review.  The first thing that struck me was the menu - its gorgeous, full colour with excellent photography, but...entirely in French. This wasn't a huge problem for me, but in Montreal this is a big no-no, especially downtown and next to Concordia.  I decided on the sweet potato and black bean burger on kamut, with tofu bacon and daiya swiss. I got their fries instead of a salad and a Zevia ginger root beer.  First impression, the fries were amazing. I'm usually a reach for the condiments guy, but these were so well seasoned they didn't need anything.  The burger had good flavour, but a couple of technical problems - the bun, being kamut, was a lot more firm than the patty. Physics played its part, but the end result was a the patty spreading beyond the bun each bite.  If they can find a way to firm it up I'd definitely try it again.  The tofu bacon was a bit disappointing, and mislabeled. Its smoked tofu, which is fine, but a very different texture than I'd expect from something labeled bacon.  I didn't notice the daiya til the very end of the meal, I wouldn't spend the extra .90 for it again.  The whole meal came to just under $16, which is way more than I'd be willing to spend on a burger and fries on a regular basis, but they are new and experimenting with their menu (which I imagine includes their prices) I worry that the area they're in will buck at the idea of a $16 lunch.  I don't recommend the Zevia sodas, they're flavoured with stevia and its call I could taste.  After my meal I got to try one of their two deserts, and opted for the brownie. My brownie standards are quite high as there are some fantastic brownie destinations in Montreal. I'd rate theirs a solid 8. Possible ways it could improve? Serving it warm, or with some sort of custard or coulis. I'd ditch the quinoa sprinkled on top too - I could easily see it being a 9 or 10 then.  I also tried their quinoa chili, the kale was a great addition, but it lacked enough sweetness for me. If you like spicy chilli, you won't be disappointed.  I'll definitely be back to try them again."}
{"text":"I got the matcha smoothie bowl and a cappuccino with soy milk. They both tasted decent but they were a bit pricey. The interior is fresh looking and was comfortable."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of copper branch. This is my first visit to a second location of copper branch. My usual location- being dix30.  I liked the central location - as a healthier alternative to a movie night meal at the forum. It was clean and we'll maintained . The menu seemed to have more variety than the south shore location- burgers, sandwiches, poutine, etc. For salad bowls - you have to choose your theme (Mediterranean, Aztec, Asian fusion, Aristotle), choice of base of grain and protein. I decided to go with the Aztec Mini bowl (8$ vs 12$ w/o tax) with Konjac noodles and teriyaki Shitake mushrooms. Perfect portion to fill me up ladies! Unless you want leftovers to take home.  The only downer - the water dispenser took 6 mins to fill up my glass! For a franchise I'm sure they can afford to purchase a fountain machine or provide the complimentary tap water to the customers themselves!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location of Copper Branch a couple of times. The food quality and preparation is comparable to other branches. Featuring burgers, soup/chilli, their infamous salad bowls that are available in small or regular/large size. There are for choices in themes/veggie base , then you pick your grain and protein. The large size of the sled bowls are pretty filling, I can never finish them. The price ranges 12-16$.   There is plenty of seating indoor and outdoors. There is a sink for customers get water and empty cups which I thought was a nice touch.I wouldn't say their staff cleans up often because I saw bowl toppling over with a full garbage and recycling bins. However for vegan fast food I can't expect anything less for cleanliness."}
{"text":"Je ne pensais pas un jour dire ça à propos d'un restaurant qui ne sert que des plantes....mais ouahou que c'est bon et original! Leur slogan peut faire sourire:\"vous êtes plus végétalien que vous ne pensez!\"mais c'est vrai!  Je suis une véritable carnivore, et j'ai été émerveillée par le goût et la qualité des mets servis dans ce restaurant! J'ai eu une révélation pour les champignons shiitake teriyaki...un vrai délice et je les recommande à tous les yeux fermés! Ils accompagnent à merveille chaque salade ou burger! Je vous conseille également de vous laisser séduire par leur dessert, et plus particulièrement le brownie aux courgettes et chocolat et le gâteau végétalien à la noix de coco....des délices!  Mais et il y a un mais, les serveurs ne sont pas très habiles avec le maniement de la langue française...."}
{"text":"i ordered the scrambled tofu sandwich southwest style which was not spicy enough for me. i love the wooden panel walls in the restaurant. the bun was rosemary herb which i thought was delicious."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I found Copper Branch on Yelp and we were completely blown away of how incredible it was. For one, I am going to now be dreaming of their shiitake mushroom protein forever. Also, their customer service was the best I have ever experienced. Thank you, Trevor (the manager) for your overall hospitality and for making our visit such a memorable experience! Looking forward to going back again :)"}
{"text":"Copper Branch satisfied both me and my foodie-vegan friends (clarification: I am not vegan, or even vegetarian, but I can get down with tofu when the duty calls), so if you're looking for a quick spot to satisfy multiple dietary preferences, I give this place my full endorsement. We were literally standing on a street corner, starving and cranky after a long and foodless trek up and back down Mont Royal and Rue Peel, when Copper Branch appeared on Yelp and saved the day.   I had the \"Aristotle\" bowl, which was a massive bowl filled with fresh greens, sweet potato, avocado, smoked tofu, a balsamic-based dressing, and other yummy veggies. It was extremely filling! I shared a raspberry chia pudding with my friend, which was delish, if a little runny. My friends loved their bowls and sandwiches, including a very pink beet burger. There are tons of vegan and gluten-free dessert options, and many of the entrees are gluten-free as well.  Oh-- the POUTINE! Vegan poutine sounded like an oxymoron to me, but damn, this was GOOD. The fries are thin-cut and delectable and topped by vegan gravy and cheese sauce that is really, really, really yummy. Get it!"}
{"text":"I have tried many vegetarian burgers at most restaurants and can count the good ones on a single hand :) This is one of them!  I ordered Spicy Bean Burger and it was simply incredible! Despite being at peak hour and fairly busy, the service time was minimal.  Am certainly planning to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"The owner is an awful person. He screamed at a friend telling her: \"Go back to your country\" because she accidentally let her tray in the wrong place. She insulted her several times and screamed at her. Left her in tears for no reason. I wouldn't go to a place like this ever. What kind of service is this? Unbelievable."}
{"text":"First of all, don't make the clumsy mistake of promising to meet up at a Copper Branch and mess up the location. There are quite a few in Montreal (my friend and I didn't know that) so we almost star-crossed. Proceeding   Copper branch is your fast-food vegan place. My friend ordered a mushroom burger and matcha latte (she is not vegetarian nor vegan), and I ordered a cheesecake (I'm vegetarian but I try my best to have vegan food when possible). My friend freaking loved her burger AND her drink, and was constantly intrigued by what's in the food because it's SO good! It was her first vegan meal, so she was evidently very excited. I tried her burger too and indeed it was good, especially the sauce! I'd recommend that burger (though I don't remember the exact name of it). The cheesecake was great too by the way, but it was served in the fridge next to the counter, which was a little disappointing. But that's because I expected this place to be less \"fast-food-like\". I was not used to having vegan fast food.  Speaking of which, my friend and I thought vegan fast food was a great thing to have. It's convenient for eat-ins and take-outs, and pretty fast and serving good, vegan food. The prices were not so high either. I would totally come grab a bite when I'm hungry at university (Concordia), I could walk there and also take a short walk break because it's not SUPER nearby.   CONS: The cashier couldn't speak English. I can speak a little French, enough to sort of communicate (and I'm also a master of body language), so it was okay, but I didn't expect that happening at all. The table was also really dirty, it wasn't cleaned before us. I had to get a napkin to clean it up myself. I don't really mind that personally, but some of you might've minded that. But again, y'know, it's a fast food place.   Copper Branch is a great place to grab a vegan bite, I really like the idea of it and I will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"I'm usually not a huge fan of chain restaurants, but Copper Branch is amazing! All their food is vegan and they have a lot of variety.  I had the Aristotle Power Bowl ($12.49). For all Power Bowls you get to choose your base and your protein. I chose brown rice and shitake teriyaki. The Aristotle bowl comes with roasted sweet potato slices, spinach hummus, bruschetta topping, black olives, mixed greens, beets, carrots, broccoli, sprouted mung beans, spiced chickpeas, and hemp seeds. The dressing (which comes on the side) was a balsamic vinaigrette, but I actually didn't use any because I thought the bowl tasted perfect without any dressing.  All ingredients tasted fresh and the flavours blended really well together. The portion size is also excellent. The regular size is great for dinner.   The restaurant was clean and staff were nice. They ask you for your name and they call your name out when your order is ready. Your name also appears on your receipt :)   There is free WiFi and the password is printed on your receipt. I think this is a good and clever way of giving access to paying customers only.   Can't wait to try their carrot keftedes as my protein next time!   I wish they would open a Copper Branch in Ottawa!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here since it opened over a year ago so I'm surprised I never reviewed it. In the past year, they have speeded up the time that it takes to prepare the food which is much appreciated! This is a cafeteria style restaurant so you order your food and pay, and then they call out your name when your food is ready.   I have tried a few different dishes, mainly their fries, the shiitake burger, the bowls and almost everything was delicious. The items I wasn't crazy about were the 'chicken' wings and the Gandhi smoothie. My personal favorite is a toss up between the shiitake burger or for something more filling, go with the General Copper Bowl, I don't know how they make those mushrooms to be so delicious but they just are. This is a place I keep coming back to when I want something that is filling, yet not heavy. Keep in mind that the prices are higher than your average cafeteria style restaurant, but the quality of the food (a lot of their ingredients are organic) justifies the price tag."}
{"text":"Family owned franchise. Husband wife are hands-on. The faux chicken (mushroom) and the \"chicken wing\" mimic meat like I've never tasted.  I'm by no means a pure vegetarian but enjoy vegetarian fare.  Their food is clean and full of FLAVOUR.  I had the Aztec bowl and it was delicious.  The staff and the energy there is great.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"This isn't the least expensive place to grab lunch but it's certainly one of the most delicious lunches you can have! I think larger portions would be more enticing since you are paying a premium price for fast vegan food. That being said, it is fast and it is a great, healthy lunch spot!"}
{"text":"Amazing vegan food! I got the Asian fusion bowl with shiitake teriyaki. The shiitake is everything! It has a meaty texture which is amazing and it's wonderfully flavoured. I also got the Caesar salad. Personally, ordering off the menu is much better than the to go ceased salad however the \"chicken\" drumsticks that came with the salad was very good. I came back for breakfast and had the south west scramble wrap, a definite must order for breakfast and best devoured hot! The \"cheese\" they used melts great. I'm so glad we have copper branch in Toronto too. I was sad that I would miss the great food."}
{"text":"So this place is basically like a vegan fast food joint! Walk-in, place an order, pay upfront, pick it up when it's ready and take it to your table! Not that there's anything wrong with that, but I just wasn't expecting it.   A few of us had a bunch of different things, and everything was overall pretty good. Nothing was really over the top or even worth trying again. I had to Copper Burger... which came with a pretty yummy dijon maple vegenaise sauce. I did try someone else's \"poutine\"... baked potatoes with a portobello gravy and vegan cheese. But not so good at all and really nothing close to a vegan poutine. (I love portobellos and I love poutine, but this just didn't work.) The Bombay soup was good but pretty mild in flavors. The shitake teriyaki spelt wrap was tasty but the coleslaw was a little too overpowering. The bowls do seem pretty interesting though, but I didn't get to try any of them, so maybe next time.  As for dessert, the Raspberry Chia pudding was pretty fun but the Cashew Cranberry Lime Dream cheesecake on the other hand was really delicious!!!! (Of course it was, since it was made by Rawesome)"}
{"text":"WOW! I called here the other day to ask a question about pricing of nachos - i dont like olives so i wanted to know if it was possible to take off the olives and replace them with shitake mushroom. this lady named Diala or something answered the phone and I have never experienced this level of rudeness in customer service! She insinuated that i was stupid for even asking and then i tried to inquire about something else she HUNG UP ON ME. literally do not go here."}
{"text":"It's a tiny food court in Alexis Nihon plaza downstairs beside yeh. The picture of my breakfast, on their board, Avocado toast attracted me.. So I ordered the toast with mango and orange juice. The service was nice with a smile. My avocado toast was amazing. It had tomato with tiny beans. I felt good. It hit right spot in my tummy."}
{"text":"The owner's attitude was the worst I have experienced in Montréal. I can't help feeling that she was being a racist. Her attitude while taking order from me was vastly different from when she was taking it from an white lady prior to me. On top of that, she \"mistakenly\" prepared our order as \"to-go\" instead of for-here. Not only did she not show any apologetic gestures, she rudely took the bags from our hands, threw the food on a tray and muttered: \" Here you go then\"."}
{"text":"I found the overall taste of the food to be mediocre. The price point is high and not proportionate to the value/taste."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here twice during our recent trip to Montreal. I am a vegetarian and she is a vegan so it can be difficult to find somewhere that can accommodate both of us.  During our first trip we ordered the mushroom poutine, the portobello mushroom burger and the spicy black bean burger. On our second trip my wife ordered the General Copper Bowl.  I am new to being a vegetarian/vegan but my wife has been a vegan for quite some time. I liked everything I ate but didn't love it. My wife on the other hand raved about everything she ate so I will go with her opinion.  The service was great and the restaurant was very clean. This is an excellent option if you are a vegan."}
{"text":"What an experience! I am a true blue Non Vegetarian but this place left me wanting more. The Shiitake Sandwich was offered to me as a suggestion by Alex, the manager. The flavor and texture of the sandwich was outstanding. Would definitely recommend this place if you are looking for something different."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved their food, their friendly staff and the Coldplay music was def a plus"}
{"text":"I had breakfast here, the quinoa bowl was very flavorful. I'm not always a huge fan but their version was great with just enough fruit mixed in as well. Really nice little spot for a quick bite in the morning."}
{"text":"I had not brown bagged that day and it so happened that I was extremely late for lunch. So around 3pm I venture out and within a short walking distance from my office I see this plant based takeout place in The Path.   I see the picture of the Shitake Burger and my stomach growled. For about $11 including taxes I get a brown bag and rush back to the office.   First impressions - did not look anywhere close to the picture in the store which luckily I had clicked. Aside from not looking as advertised I began to chow down. As you might relate to this - when you are starving anything you eat seems delicious; however it this case it was the opposite the burger missed the mark. My assumption was that there were pieces of fresh mushrooms, this tasted as soy mushroom processed pieces that I have tasted at Asian restaurants. This seemed run of the mill rather than the uniqueness I was hoping for.   The toppings bothered me as well as it was too unflavoured. The over done bread/bun that didn't look like the picture wasn't helpful either."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my meal, but I found that the advertisement was misleading, showing ads that state that for $1.50 the meal could become a trio... It took us forever to understand the employee's explanations, which were confusing. Instead the bill came up to almost $20, which is no problem, but the advertising shouldn't be so misleading."}
{"text":"Good and fast place. Nice that it's vegan so you can get a fast meal and at least feel like you're hitting your diet goals."}
{"text":"I actually discovered Copper Branch when I was at a conference and their company did some catering. I've seen their franchise all over downtown but I was hesitant and wrote it off as another wannabe healthy fast food place...and boy, was I wrong!  Good: at $8.49 for a mini bowl (which is pretty generous), you get a hearty mix of vegetables and protein option. I always get the Aztec bowl with shiitake teriyaki (it's a mock chicken with mushroom base). One of the most satisfying fast healthy food places you'll ever eat at, without feeling bloated or guilty. The staff is also very friendly at this particular location and I purposely come to the Bishop location even if there's another one closer to me. Great job with the customer service!  Bad: my boyfriend tried to order a burger but swapped the buns for a wrap (which later we found out was an extra $1.50 charge) and it looked like the most pathetic and unappetizing wrap I've ever seen. It looked like a 4 year old rolled it up. Granted, it still tasted pretty good, but it was really small and barely filling (for the same price as a bowl). The whole time I was eating my food, I was roasting my boyfriend  and his sad wrap. Moral of the story is, don't get their poorly made wraps if aesthetics matter to you.  Bottom line: out with Aux Vivres, this is my new favourite vegetarian spot!"}
{"text":"Last time i was here i had the black bean burger. I meant to do a review and it totally slipped my mind. It's a great vegan fast food place with a good ambiance. This time i had the galaxy burger with mushrooms. It is soooooo delicious,the mix of mushrooms, eggplant and aioli is decadent. I could not get over the Gluten free bread it is some of the best Gluten free burger buns i have tasted. I will definitely be going by the bakery in LaSalle to get my hands on these!!!  Will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I can't wait for the day vegan and vegetarian restaurants become more popular and prices start going down.  Anyway, Copper Branch is a family favorite. I love any restaurant where I can eat a good poutine without having stomach aches or worrying about finding a bathroom (the woes of lactose intolerance). I've eaten here a bunch of times and each time has been a great experience. The bowls are good, the soups are yummy, the chili is dope, the poutine is fabulous (sweet potatoes give it that extra oomph).  Copper Branch is a great addition to the West Island!"}
{"text":"Copper branch is a great spot to get very healthy vegan food when you are in a hurry. I really adore their galaxy burger....nom! I also like thier bowls because there is usually a generous amount of veggies. I also recommend you grab the Gandhi smoothie if you go. More like Sooooothie because of the refreshing ginger which really refreshes you.  Read more about them on my blog: http://mtlveg.com/2016/05/25/montreal-vegan-restaurant-copper-branch/"}
{"text":"Came here twice in a week! Both times the staff were cold and not very welcoming.  They might still be bitter about Trump being president in the USA? Maybe I don't have enough tattoos or piercings or they don't like people driving a gas guzzling Lamborghini? Maybe the friends I came with looked too much like strippers? Well none of that is me so maybe it's all in my head? Maybe the \"healthy\" food they serve here makes me paranoid?  Well whatever it is, I like it here! Even though they don't seem to like me... Next time I'll come by in my new Tesla and invite some trendy hipsters!  The food here is absolutely delicious! A lot of ingredients are ORGANIC (!!!) and everything is vegan (prepare yourself to fart all night long) and looks and tastes wonderful. Tried their spicy black beans burger which was OK but their General Copper bowl is simply orgasmic. That will fill and fuel you up for a good 12 hours! A lot of food! Amazing flavors. Loved it. Had an organic coffee and a Rise kombucha drink, divine!   Hope they open many more locations. This is the future of food in restaurants, tasty and organic, more respectful of the planet and of our body. Now I need to figure out why it makes me so gassy!"}
{"text":"Great vegan place. I discovered that place when I was in Montreal. I have had the Copper Burger and the fusion salad; the mini size was enough; the French fries were really good. I will go back."}
{"text":"This place has such a cool vibe! super down to earth (obviously). A really great place if your looking for lunch or dinner. The only thing I don't like about this place is how pricey it is. Yelp says only two $$ but it was almost $20 for a small bowl and a drink."}
{"text":"The Copper Branch restaurant in/near Oshawa is fantastic. This satellite food-court type of location is not that great. Staff aren't knowledgeable about their own food and five hours after eating there, the roof of my mouth is still feeling scalded from the boiling-hot, steaming water-logged mushroom in the Galaxy Burger.    Hey, guys- if you are going to rush the cooking of the burger and not cool down the massive mushroom so it doesn't scald your customers at least warn me not to bite into this like a normal burger. Ouch!"}
{"text":"The food is quite tasty. The vegan chicken sandwich tastes almost like real chicken. A bit pricey though... Almost $15 for a soup and sandwich."}
{"text":"One of the best black bean burgers I've ever had is offered here. Combine that with the amazing oven roasted French fries cooked in olive oil and you have an absolute winner.  The power bowls are also really tasty and enough to satisfy you for a lunch of dinner.  The staff are really nice here and the location is clean and relaxed. Easy to get to with the parking behind the restaurant too.  Really like this location."}
{"text":"Good casual choice for vegan food. I had the shiitake burger, and it was quite good, the mushroom shreds had a very meaty and pleasant texture and carried the sauce well. I'm curious to know how they process the shiitake, perhaps a combination of dehydrating or roasting? The bun was soft, warm, and delicious, I liked the sesame seeds (nice touch)...I'm a sucker for tasty bread. The fries were peppery and air fried or roasted, which led to some of them being more leathery than crisp. They only offer ketchup as a dip, which is organic but much too salty in my opinion. My companions also enjoyed their meals, even the extortionately priced 7$ avocado toast. It's a good place to go if theres a vegan in the group...its fairly cheap, tasty, quick and lacks the prrtentious vibe. Not exactly healthy (though some options are better than others), but I'm here for taste :) Place was very clean and had a nice view of the street for people watching. Staff was nice, though food is self serve. Free lemon water!"}
{"text":"Ok, I can't believe this place has any good (or even average) reviews. My friend and I (both vegan) went here for dinner one night when we found ourselves downtown and extremely hungry. The place feels like any other fast food restaurant (order at the counter, carry your own tray to your table), which is fine, but good to know before going. We were excited to try everything and so ordered a bunch of food, but unfortunately all of it ranged from disappointing to disgusting.  The Aztec bowl was sad. It was just a bunch of ingredients thrown together without any effort to make the flavours combine. It was dry, under-spiced, and mostly tasteless. The sweet potato & black bean burger was worse. Similarly dry, under-spiced, and tasteless, but it also seemed like everything had been store-bought and then frozen for ages. Easily the worst veggie burger I've ever had. The (small) poutine with portobello miso sauce sounded amazing but was inedible. The fries were soggy, there was so much gravy it seemed more like a soup than a poutine, the daiya cheese wasn't even melted, and the whole thing was COLD. Oh yeah, and everything was overpriced - it came out to about $30 for the three items, before tip.  This place was so shockingly bad that my friend and I talked about it for a while afterward. I can't believe they opened two locations at once. Seems like it's being run by business people who have absolutley no idea how to make food. Even though there aren't many vegan restaurants in Montreal, you couldn't pay me to eat at this place again."}
{"text":"100% vegetarian place near McGill! I wish I knew about this place while I was a student.   They have really great salads called Power Bowls. My favourite Power Bowl so far is the Mediterranio with sun dried tomatoes, green peppers, chia seeds, eggplant, zucchini, sweet potato, chickpeas, broccoli, beets, mung beans, and carrot on a bed of lettuce. For protein we chose smoked tofu cubes which was amazing. I love literally every single thing they include. Sadly, I don't have a picture of it :(.  We went another time and ordered Aristotle, which includes sweet potato, spinach hummus, bruschetta, black olives, hemp seeds, broccoli, beets, carrots, chickpeas, mung beans on top of noodles. For protein, we chose carrot keftedes, which were like falafels but with carrots. This was good too, but I'd rather order Mediterranio when I go back.   We also ordered two burgers: Mushroom Galaxy Burger and Spicy Black Bean Burger. The mushroom one is a giant chewy, juicy portobello mushroom with eggplant, caramelized onions, \"cheese\", lettuce and aioli sauce. Black bean burger was with a patty made of black beans, sweet potato, rice, and few other ingredients. The food itself is really, really good and if I were a vegetarian I'd want to eat this everyday. However, the prices are bit steep. With tax it comes to around $10 for just a burger. Maybe not worth the money to try more than once, at least for me.  Next time I really want to try their wings, I'm curious what vegetarian-style wings would taste like.  The first time I came by, the service was really nice. The cashier was very friendly and made small talk about Harry Potter :). The workers always seem to have smiles on their faces. Good atmosphere."}
{"text":"Spicy black bean burger here is phenomenal. The fake chicken wings are also great, poutine is worth it especially if you add extra toppings."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. Every one of the bowls I have tried are fantastic. The ingredients are fresh, so colourful and delicious. My husband loves the spicy black bean burgers. Love the cucumber water readily available when you walk in. Such a delicious meal!"}
{"text":"Great food and the staff was so lovely, much more than at the green panther and other vegan places I've tried! Aztec bowl super delicious!"}
{"text":"As a vegan, I want to like this place so much, and we need places like this so bad in the financial district, but I can't, I can't go to Copper Branch any more. After about the 5th attempt, and trying something different every time, I gave a breakfast item a go, the South West Wrap Scramble. It's as if whoever made it threw everything on a crumpled wrap and used their fists to roll it up. The ends weren't closed in the least, so the excessive liquid poured on the paper wrap, down my fingers and my arms, and food just kept falling out. Taste wise, I'd give it a 7/10, so not great but not terrible, but it might have been the \"best\" tasting thing I've had there.  This place is so convenient for me, and exactly the type of food I need, but I won't be returning."}
{"text":"They often mess up my order here.. Seems like the employees are young Dawson students. It happens about 70% of the time honestly."}
{"text":"Awesome place with some unique vegan menu offerings. I tried copper burger and shiitake teriyaki burger. Both were good but on the sweeter side. If you like spicy or salty, avoid these two. They are definitely very sweet. The poutine was good but felt a little too salty. I took out one star for a long wait - about 20 minutes to get our food. But I guess it is the price to pay for freshness. Also, portions felt on the smaller side. But again this may be me being used to American sized portions where a burger is larger than one's head."}
{"text":"I am always satisfied. Went there for the first time during summer. Since then, I go there when I wanna eat healthy food. Really good selection of bowls. Especially love the shitake! The mini is enough for me to make me full. The place is clean, staff are friendly. Would definitely recommend this place:)"}
{"text":"I'm going to give this location less than the PointeClaire one since I literally tried both within a week of each other and service-wise and quality-wise, West Island all the way!  It's a pretty store; brand new and has ample seating for small groups. But I guess because the staff is new, they don't really know what's happening.   The girl at the cash could barely answer any of my questions so I ended up ordering wtv... kind of disappointed.   My burger's bun was super dry... otherwise the black bean burger is pretty tasty. The Aristotle bowl was ok, filling and healthy but nowhere near as delicious as the General Copper bowl.   Will probably be returning - not because of the service simply because it's a healthy option super close from where I live."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed their food the last 2 times. The new black bean and sweet potato south west burger is delicious, their oven baked fries are ok but their \"general tao\" shiitake mushroom bowl is DELICIOUS.   Healthy and filling, the only downside is the price point. $15 is a little steep for lunch but it really is \"power food\".   Will be going back!!"}
{"text":"I've always loved Copper Branch. Just grabbed a quick meal next to AMC forum before heading to the movie theater yesterday. The food was good. The reason of giving one star: incompetent staffs.  1. No forks available. They are probably short of staffs because the service was pretty slow. 2.Hot sauce bottle was empty.  3. I asked for a mini Mediterranean bowl and repeated my order twice. I just realized that I got an Asian fusion bowl instead when I got a bite on kimchi.   Didn't bother to exchange for a new bowl since I was already starting to eat and I don't want to wait another 10 minutes in line to get a new one.   In all, I don't mind about the Asian fusion bowl, I liked it anyway but I will give the service 0 point.  Will try the one in the Alexis Nihon mall next time instead."}
{"text":"Work lunch from time to time. Their bowls r really delicious with multiple choices of protein. If you wanna something light, healthy, organic and affordable for a casual lunch or dinner. That's the place to go."}
{"text":"Thinking that the place would be clean and fresh-I liked that the place had just opened. It was a pleasant environment.  Very nice menu. Fresh and tasty. Loved the Bombay soup it had just enough spice without being hot. Although if you want there plenty of spicy condiments. Ridiculously portions for oven fried potatoes  we got the small & it was too much for two of us."}
{"text":"The restaurant is pretty okay, considering it's vegan and almost all options on the menu come gluten free (for a celiac, this is amazing!)  I was sort of unimpressed with the portobello mushroom burger as keeping it in the bun was pretty much impossible -- it ended up all over my hands and I ended up having to eat it with a fork.  Maybe not the best design.  My boyfriend had a bowl and it looked pretty alright.  I also want to add that while I'm no garlic fascist, your bean dip gave me the worst breath imaginable.  I don't know how you managed to put that much garlic in there, but coming from a garlic lover you need to tone it down a little.  Either way, this place has some kinks it needs to work out, but it'll get there.  I'm proud to say we've got a vegan fast food joint in Montreal."}
{"text":"So its my first night in Montreal, and I'm sad to say that I couldn't get myself to leave my warm hotel room after a long day out in the cold. This Miami girl was having none of the struggle of putting on 6 layers of cold. Long story short- take out time.  I ordered from this restaurant because I read good reviews about it, and the food was so good! Personally I enjoy a good amount of veggie meat to vegetables portions so I loved each meal! We kind of picked a variety of things off the menu so when I got the food I just guessed what I was eating. But you can't go wrong- everything was so tasty!  They delivered the food 20 minutes earlier then we expected, and straight to the room! Also keep in mind that the servings are a bit small so order accordingly."}
{"text":"The food was delicious as always but the service was very underwelming. I will not be returning to this location. It took 5 minutes for the staff member at the cash to acknowledge that I was standing waiting to order. I had to firmly place my drink on the counter for her to look up from her computer and ask to take my order. After placing my order I waited 25 minutes for my food. The staff were busy talking to each other not in much of a rush so I thought it was just taking a while for my order to come out. I then went up to ask if the order would be coming out soon and the employee that took my order had forgotten about it. She did not apologize and I ended up getting my food 30 minutes after ordering. It's a shame because I have always loved the food at copper branch but the staff definitely needs to be a little more diligent at this location! A proper apology and some sort of acknowledgement of having made me wait 30 minutes for my order would have gone a long way :)!"}
{"text":"J'adore cette chaine de restaurant végétalien! J'avais vraiment hâte qu'une succursale ouvre enfin à Laval. C'est ma première fois ici. J'aurais aimé que ça ne soit pas situé dans le Carrefour Laval et je crois que l'endroit est un peu petit. Je doute qu'ils fournissent aux heures de pointe. La bouffe est excellente malgré les prix mais la qualité vaut ce surplus à la caisse. Mon seul point négatif est sur le service. Les jeunes sont blasé, ça parrait. Et le pire à été de me faire servir en anglais exclusivement. Je déteste qu'on me serve en anglais au Québec. Ce n'est pas seulement un manque de respect, c'est contre la loi."}
{"text":"Lorsque j'ai commandé (en spécifiant que j'allais être assise sur la terrasse à l'extérieur), on m'a dit que ça prendrait 10 minutes (déjà je trouvais le délais plutôt long pour du riz et des brocolis, mais je me suis dit que si ça en valait la peine, j'allais attendre dehors patiemment). J'ai demandé à la caissière s'ils allaient venir porter mon bol sur la terrasse lorsque ce serait prêt, mais elle m'a dit qu'il fallait que je revienne moi-même dans 10 minutes pour le recevoir. D'accord. J'ai alors regardé l'heure et je suis sortie à l'extérieur. 8 minutes plus tard, je suis entrée afin d'être prête lorsqu'ils serviraient mon bol (j'ai alors perdu ma place dehors puisque j'étais seule et que quelqu'un s'y est assis quand je suis entrée). Mon bol n'était pas prêt. D'autres clients arrivés après moi étaient maintenant servis.. Je suis donc ressortie quelques minutes et lorsque j'ai vu de l'extérieur qu'il y avait un bol sur le comptoir, j'ai cru que c'était le mien, alors je suis entrée le chercher. Mais ce n'était lui.. J'ai demandé au préparateur où en était ma commande et il m'a dit qu'elle n'existait plus! Il a parlé à la caissière en disant qu'il l'avait remis à une autre cliente arrivée après moi!! Pas la peine de spécifier qu'ils demandent nos noms lorsqu'on commande en plus... La caissière m'a ainsi dit que ça allait reprendre un autre 10 minutes pour m'en préparer un nouveau! Lorsque j'ai dit non, que je voulais être remboursée à la place, elle m'a dit que finalement, ça allait prendre seulement 2 minutes..! Mais pourquoi m'ont-ils fait attendre 10 minutes la première fois alors?! Enfin, ça aurait pu passer, mais la caissière n'était pas capable de me rembourser en argent par elle-même, alors elle a demandé à l'autre fille derrière (ça devait être la gérante) qui m'a engueulée pour me dire que c'était ma faute si je n'avais pas reçu mon bol parce qu'ils avaient dit mon nom, mais que comme je ne venais pas (j'étais DEHORS alors je ne pouvais pas entendre!!), tant pis pour moi, j'ai perdu mon bol!! J'ai alors dû lui répondre d'assumer son erreur et de ne pas me mettre sa responsabilité sur le dos alors que j'attendais longuement seule sur la terrasse et que je devais en plus me déplacer moi-même pour venir le chercher! Elle ne m'a pas remis tout le montant au complet lors de la remise et elle avait une attitude arrogante alors qu'elle aurait dû s'excuser d'avoir remis mon bol à une autre et de mon aussi longue attente! Enfin, alors qu'elle m'a souhaité une bonne soirée sur un ton très ironique, je ne peux que lui souhaiter la meilleure des faillites!"}
{"text":"Situated at the very border of quartier Dix30, it is hidden from the naked eyes, you will need google map for this one I think.  We had their blueberry waffles as an entré. It was dry to my taste at the beginning but if you let it sit in the sauce and blueberry jam for a bit it moisturizes the waffles making it much better. I had their shiitake burger which was absolutely delicious. Most common complaints for vegan food from non vegan people is that the food is dry, no flavour, and tastes like grass. Well not this burger. It was quite tasty for me.  I also had the chance to try one of their bowl: the Mediterranean bowl. You get a choice of \"base\": brown rice, salad, or quinoa and a choice of protein; tempeh, tofu, and shiitake mushroom. We chose brown rice and tempeh. It was delicious. The bowl is full of different veggies and source of proteins. The taste comes from different spices and sauce that you mix together.  They also sell a poutine, but honestly it wasn't that good. I've had better vegan poutine. The cheese is so hard to replicate for vegan. It's just not the same. If you're vegan, you might like it but otherwise you might be disappointed.  Overall, it might seems to be a bit pricey for \"fast food\" vegan style but then again it's a vegan style fast food.  Fun fact: they have breakfast options."}
{"text":"Good but not out of this world. A bit expensive for the quantity, and for what is basically juste vegetables. Really quick service."}
{"text":"Le burger au shiitake est délicieux et celui aux fèves noires aussi mais reste plus  commun . Grosse portion de frites qui gagneraient à rester au four quelques minutes de plus pour leur donner du tonus! Service courtois dans un décor raffiné et urbain. Choix de plats très large passant des burgers aux burritos et aux salades.  Génial de savoir qu'on peut manger de savoureux plats en épargnant les animaux!"}
{"text":"Went to this place for lunch today as it was close to US Consulate. Spicy Bean Burger was the best burger ever. They were extremely busy but service was fast. Price is slightly high but quality of food is excellent.   If you're around than you don't want to miss this amazing restaurant. Cheers!"}
{"text":"This was a nice place. very good atmosphere. Fresh cooked food. It is actually very busy. Was really surprised. The only issue is that seating space is limited. BUt otherwise really good."}
{"text":"Would love if a location opens in NYC!  This is great vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free \"fast\"-food joint.  I wrote \"fast\" in quotes because I waited a solid 15 (maybe even 20) minutes for my burger and carrot keftedes to be ready.  But it was totally worth it.  I certainly appreciate being able to choose almost anything on the menu, considering that my lifestyle is based on an anti-inflammatory diet.  Best way to describe this place is that's it's a funner, more grown-up, and open-minded version of By Chloe's in NYC.  Ya know - that girl cousin you had who was 2-3 grades older than you, and she seemed way cooler because she was able to tease her hair, wear makeup, get trendy clothes, while you were still wearing the white reeboks and Alexander's jeans.  By this reasoning Copper Branch is the cool older cousin because it has way more offerings that are all incredibly creative and thinking outside-the-box.  The burger was so good, as was the sauce.  Loved the carrot keftedes!    If they don't come to NYC before I get back to Montreal, I'll definitely pay them another visit while I'm there."}
{"text":"Agreed that this is not a place to go at lunch time as you can easily wait 20 minutes and then end up with the wrong order, plus the service is pretty rude...  However, i always really enjoy the food here. The bowls are flavourful and healthy, the protein options are all interesting and well prepared. The burgers and sandwiches can be a bit heavy but also have great flavour,and you can get a greens wrap instead of bread which is s great idea. I have tried almost everything on the menu and enjoyed it all! Its not ground breaking veggie food in any way, but if you want something nice, quick and relatively healthy, i would recommend it !"}
{"text":"Worst excuse for vegan food I have ever had. I was so excited to find this place while here visiting from CA. Paid $90 for my family to eat and threw most of it in the trash.  Poutine was gross and the nachos even worse. Don't waste your time or money here."}
{"text":"Just had one of the best burger I had in my life. It was full of delicious mushrooms. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"All vegan with many options to choose from. Decent price for the amount of food you get. They only give u 1 small cup of sauce/dressing then it's $0.89 each afterwards. The base is warm and the rest is cold, wish it was all warm.  1. Aztec mini with brown rice and shiitake teriyaki: Good flavor with the basil olive oil dressing. Just wish there was more dressing and a bit more rice. A good amount of all the ingredients. The shiitake teriyaki was very flavorful and sweet. Good texture.   2. Aristotle regular with quinoa and shiitake teriyaki: Bf got this and loved the flavor. A huge portion for the price. Mixed in the 2 spicy sauce and said the flavor was excellent together.   Overall, a great place to get vegan food in downtown."}
{"text":"The bean burger is really good. Though I have to say that if  you order from it with foodora you might be pretty disappointed. We ordered two vegan poutine once and it got with almost no cheese and no sauce. They were nice enough when we call to give us two more although we had to go get it ourselves. I guess, like any chain restaurant, the service can vary from place to place but they still need to have some standards about the food."}
{"text":"I visited Montreal for a weekend and I literally grabbed breakfast here every single day. I was vegan at the time so it was difficult to come across a vegan breakfast spot but we found this gem! It was so delicious and the staff was VERY friendly. The ambiance is awesome and the decor is one of a kind. I will definitely visit here again on my next trip to Montreal!"}
{"text":"Food was average. I paid more than avg $$ and what I got was bowl full of quinoa and barely any zucchini. Eggplant and broccoli were no where to be found. The rest, it was a generous portion no complaints. It did taste good. But for I paid I expect slightly more zucchini. All over disappointed. Oh I still remember the avocado toast that I bough for breakfast was falling all over the place"}
{"text":"Its my first time trying out this place, it's always crowded and I thought to myself, i should give it a try.   I just had the General Copper bowl, on eats week by ritual because I will never pay this amount at a place Ive never tried, for a meal with no meat.  I didnt end up finishing the bowl and I eat anything, and devour all my food.  Quality of each content in the bowl tastes awful and together ugh. The sauce is good, so they could have used more of that to mask the taste of the ugh. Quantity was too little as well.  I get that this place is for vegans, and maybe thats why i (a non vegan) hated it, but come on! Anyways, this just shows why ill never be vegan.  That was just unnecessarily bad.  I give it 2 stars and not 1 because I'm not vegan and benefit of the doubt and all that :)"}
{"text":"J'adore y aller. L'ambiance est chouette et une superbe terrasse l'été. Il y a des sièges pour bébé sur place. Un peu cher (30$ pour un bol régulier Aztec avec un assiette pour enfant et un kumbucha). Révélation pour le shiitake tériaki et les fausses ailes tériaki aussi! Le hic, pas de table à langer sur place!"}
{"text":"I tried the spicy black bean burger. It was juicy and tasty! Seasoned well and just the right amount of spicy. Staff was friendly and food was prepared very fast. The decor and ambiance is casual and welcoming. I'd recommend Cooper Branch also as a quick business lunch!"}
{"text":"The waffles are to die for. First, they are GLUTEN FREE. They really need to get this in Flordia."}
{"text":"I just ate here with a few friends. 2 of us ordered fries and the Copper burger. The fries were OBVIOUSLY precooked and heated. They tasted as if they were at least a day old and were starchy and inedible. Their ketchup tasted like barbque sauce!  The presentation of the veggie burgers was sloppy and the burgers were cold on the inside!  Neither of us received our reciepts so we had to pay for parking as we didn't get our parking validated :(  Also, the wait time was 15 minutes!! The workers didn't seemed stressed due to the rush and were moving very slowly and in the end what you get is worse than something a teenager would have made but these guys were grown adults!  The smoothie was OK but it's not fresh fruit it's just high sugar ingredients. The seating next to the restaurant was full of dawson kids eating McDonalds so we had to eat upstairs (also crowded with students)  PASS."}
{"text":"I hope your parchment paper is edible. I ordered a large poutine via delivery. As I was eating it  I realize I was chewing on parchment paper that was stuck on all the french fries. They must of overcooked it and got stuck on the paper. I had to completely throw it out. Maybe try using aluminum foil."}
{"text":"Clean, pretty surroundings serving delicious vegan meals. Diverse \"bowls\" offer a big helping of various veggie options for about $15. Choose your base and your protein, for themed items such as Aztec and Mediterranean. The carrot keftedes are a good choice for those who are sick of tofu. Very nice staff. They serve breakfast too, although I haven't tried it yet. Never been disappointed with lunch choices."}
{"text":"Try the chocolate & banana chia pudding! Great for an energizing breakfast.  Havent tried anything here yet but everything seems great so far"}
{"text":"I went with my family after seeing this place reviewed by a vegan YouTuber. This is a vegan spot in downtown Montreal and their veggie burgers were the best. This place is affordable but a bit limited on seating if you go during a busy time. Think of this as a vegan version of Panera Bread."}
{"text":"I would like to start off by saying that I'm not vegan, however the food is amazing.  My girlfriend and I have probably had over 50% of the items on the menu.  For plant based food, it was way more flavorful than I ever imagined it could be.  Staff is always friendly, super helpful and very accommodating.  The food comes out quick too!! I would recommend this place to vegans and even non-vegans.  Must try."}
{"text":"Première visite a ce restaurant Vegan.  Salades variées avec des protéines végétales ,légumes. Burger aux champignons  Tout est extrêmement frais. Deux formats de salades sont offerts. Frites disponibles et du tofu plein le menu.  Ma salade etait délicieuse et copieuse. J'ai commandé la fusion.  Stationnement facile et belle petite terrasse.  À table libre service est tout pres pour se prendre un verre d'eau."}
{"text":"This was an ok breakfast place. I ordered the quinoa breakfast bowl, which was a bit too sweet. The fruit topping was clearly not fresh and appeared to have been warmed in a microwave (presumably from frozen). However, the meal was filling and overall the flavor and texture was ok. The coffee was mediocre- better to go to a café or even Starbucks."}
{"text":"I liked their selection but I'm only giving 3 stars because I didn't like the quinoa bowl. It was dry and the mango tasted fishy to me. In all honesty, it might just be me because I don't really eat Quinoa on a regular basis, so maybe I was just hoping it would be better than it was. Staff was friendly and there was ample seating. I would say this is more of a lunch spot than breakfast."}
{"text":"Everything is vegan.  Counter service with a couple dozen seats.  Vegan poutine:  2 stars.  It loos like their french \"fries\" are baked, and not very thoroughly.  It feels more like lumpy mashed potatoes and gravy.  Pretty ugly looking too.  Maybe the worst rendition of poutine I've had.  The vegan bowls: 4 stars -- or so I'm told by others at the table.  They ***looked*** beautiful.  Oddity: They have free wi-fi, but you need a special code from your receipt to connect.  But they won't give you your receipt until you've received your food, so you'll need to pay for cellular data while waiting for your food to be prepped.  Not a great system.  Oh, and the special code includes Os and 0s.  Good luck telling them apart."}
{"text":"J'aurais mis 2.5 si je pouvais mais je n'ai pas envie de noter à 3 ...  Pros : - Vegan - Ce que j'ai mangé/gouté était bon. Que cela soit mon burger shitake ou le burger à la patate douce. Les frites au four changent des classiques frites à l'huile  Cons : - Cher, pour 29 dollars on a eu le droit à 2 burgers et une grosse frite.

Idem pour les desserts qui sont dans des emballages en plastique, quel intérêt lorsque l'on mange sur place à part générer des déchets inutilement ? - Le coté trop fast food des lieux  Je n'adhère pas à leur modèle et je trouve des incohérences dans leur fonctionnement, Je ne reviendrais pas renouveler l'expérience"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on April 28 around 1:45. Service was excellent. The employees never stopped working. Service was fast and food was good."}
{"text":"The vegan poutine was OK; I wish the cheese actually melted. The power bowls (breakfast and lunch) are good. Just know that they are a bit slow with making the food."}
{"text":"Absurd attitudes and awful food. We were 3 for brunch and we all ordered the \" all day breakfast \" waffles ...which were served cold...not even tepid. When the server was asked why all 3 servings were cold we were told that we \"should understand that the waffles were made in the morning \" ! ?  2 of us asked if the meals could be reheated , the other gave up after the ridiculous attitude ,  and the server complied  (   the ice-cold waffles were then nuked in a micro-wave, yippee) . The warm-over was still crap.  I guess waffles, and maybe everything else, from the \"all day breakfast\"  are made once a day and thereafter served  cold or nuked , depending on your taste... or tolerance.  Never again."}
{"text":"My mom and I went down to Montreal to visit my brother who was working there for awhile. We were in Old Montreal, looking for vegetarian food as it happened to be a religious day when we don't eat meat. This place was maybe a 20 minute walk,  which isn't bad but with my family already being hungry,  they were groaning and moaning and complaining that this place was too far away. However, I trusted my fellow yelpers enough to know this place would be worth the walk.  So we get there, around 2 and my family almost doesn't walk in because the place is empty and they think it may not be good (no faith!). We finally make it in and find out the whole place is vegan and they focus on good quality fast food. My brother and I ordered the galaxy burger and my mom ordered the Mediterranean bowl. Both were absolutely delicious. Needless to say, my family ate their words, while they gulped down their delicious meals!"}
{"text":"I am not vegan but I still really enjoyed the food here. Everything is made on the spot and they have a wide variety of options. If you're not vegan like me and are a little hesitant, I would definitely try the vegan poutine to start. The portobello mushroom \"gravy\" makes it taste a little gourmet. That being said, everything that I have tried tastes amazing. The only thing deterring me from returning is how expensive everything is. I understand that you are paying for fresh and healthy ingredients, but it's still a little pricey."}
{"text":"I decided to try out the Copper Branch location on Mont Royal Avenue for lunch one day as I was looking for a place near work that will serve me a hearty salad for lunch and not the lettuce-tomato based options most take out places offer.   I ordered one of the power bowls for lunch; you choose a base from brown rice, quinoa, konjac noodles or mixed lettuce, and then a protein from tempeh, tofu cubes, tofu scramble, shiitake teriyaki, or carrot keftedes. i went for the asian Fusion bowl with edamame, kimchi, beets, carrot, broccoli, sprouted mung beans, spiced chickpeas, goji berries, and black sesame seeds over a mixed lettuce base, with shitake mushrooms for protein, and the tamari ginger dressing. Ouf that was as much as a mouthful to say as it was to eat! The regular portion was more than filling and I thoroughly enjoyed the flavors and mix of textures in the salad.  The ingredients were fresh, well prepared but I found the salad a little heavy with all those beans and not enough greens considering I only had at most half a cup of lettuce.   The venue itself was clean and well maintained; nothing fancy but it is a chain after all! The service was friendly and personalized, which much like Starbucks, they call you up by name to pick up your order.  Overall, i enjoyed my visit. I would be curious to try their other combinations. However, I would prefer a little more lettuce in my power bowl next time..."}
{"text":"Walked to Notre Dame basilica instead of St. Patrick's by accident. Glad I back-tracked to find this place. I ordered the black bean sweet potato burger and some vegan poutine. After seeing omnivore friends eating poutine everyday, I knew I couldn't leave without trying it, and Copper Branch didn't disappoint. Gravy and fries were delicious. Not a huge fan of Daiya cheese, but had no problem giving these fries a good home in my belly. Delicious and would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Good vegan food, which can be hard to come by: I really enjoy the teriyaki burger when they don't leave the avocado peel on the avocado that comes as an extra. Service is poor: there's a manager-type who seems to frequently have to take over for other staff who are kind of lacking in customer service skills. It's not cheap either, but given the nutritional value, that's all right by me."}
{"text":"This is a vegan restaurant that even tastes good for non vegans. The spicy black bean burger is great."}
{"text":"I love the spicy sweet potato burger here. I also tried the chocolate waffle, which is nicely done with berry compote. The b other tastes so much like a meat burger.   I love the concept of this place and the mission of living life to the fullest."}
{"text":"Tasty, quick, healthy food. Bowls, burgers and more. A great option for vegetarians/ vegans.  This is basically a healthy fast-food joint- you order and pay at the cash and they call your name when it's ready, there's a counter with utensils and condiments, and you clean up after yourself. Located, quite aptly, next door to McDonalds. A much better option!  This place just opened so I think they're still figuring things out- the staff seem a little unsure and the manager could have kept his voice down when telling them how to do things (I don't need to hear about making sure the sandwiches are fresh, or how \"life starts after work\" while I'm trying to enjoy my lunch)- but they'll get the hang of it."}
{"text":"This place is scrap. Expensive and tasteless. I would seriously reevaluate what your selling. Vegan food doesn't have to taste like nothing. Or maybe it does.   Go to Adonis next door"}
{"text":"I agree with the review about them having one of the best burgers here - the teriyaki mushroom burger is really good ... both in taste and texture.  I'm not a vegetarian and only decided to come here out of a sense of trying something new... and oh boy was I pleasantly surprised!"}
{"text":"I'm not a vegetarian but if I was I would be a regular here. I ordered take out..   The Asian salad was filling as quite flavorful. I would have liked the sauce to have more of a finger kick, it almost tasted the the store bought wafu dressing (not a bad thing). I chose the quinoa but I have several choices. That's what I liked you have options with everything.. I even added shiitake Teriyaki mushrooms which highly recommend. I like that the dressing was in the side. I can actually say i could have only ordered the salad and I'd be full! I did want to try the Bombay soup which was a pea soup with coconut milk. It was simple and not spicy at all. I did enjoy my healthy and vegetarian experience. There are 8 locations in montreal and they defiantly like there labels \"franchise\" .. everything from the paper takeout bag to the paper food box, paper soup bowl .. oh and let's not forget the paper napkins .. \"copper branch .. power food-plant-based\""}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my Galaxy/Portobello burger, best I ever had actually, although not the service I was expecting for my first visit:  - I had thought it was table service, was surprised it was basically a take out place with tables; loveley decor and tables just the same.  We had chosen this place to go out for date night and to be pampered, not exactly what we were expecting, so date night was cut short.  - The entrance of the restaurant is a bit strange, so much that we backed out to make sure we had the right location, as the sign outside states Second Cup and quite honestly that, with the style of the restaurant being off of our expectations, we were confused.  -The food was amazing, although expensive and took quite a bit of time.  I had the Galaxy burger, my date the spicy black bean burger.  We were both expecting a small side dish with the burger, like a fresh salad, extra small portion of fries, or something to that effect, although none was given, it was just the burger.  Disappointing.    I would love to return here, although with the price and delay (25 minutes for our burgers) to make things, not sure I will.  There is an Aux Vivres/vegan restaurant that is opening up one block east of this location that will offer service, has the extras we are looking for, at the same price point as Copper Branch.  Ultimately this means that Aux Vivres will likely become our new date night spot."}
{"text":"Excellent, much enjoyed the Copper burger and the power bowl was delicious. Very friendly staff and atmosphere was great. Fresh food no complaints for this review"}
{"text":"Eww. I got the quinoa breakfast bowl, and it is literally hunks of dry quinoa, huge soggy chunks of overripe banana, and hot pineapple with coconut on top. And I gave them about $6 for this gunk... Inedible and disappointing."}
{"text":"Their (seasonal?) Grand Sumac was possibly the best veggie burger I've ever had and the fries they serve up as a side are exactly the way I like my ideal fry to be- fresh cut, a little limp, perfectly salted... all of this was right up my alley.   The quinoa bowl I got was just okay... actually, it was pretty meh and for sure a let-down. Especially after trying that phenomenal burger. The protein I chose was the smoked tofu and there were a total of 3 nickel-sized cubes in the entire thing... kind of made me feel like it was a waste to even stop and ask what I wanted as my protein since it was barely present in the bowl.   The veggie chili was good and hearty but if you eat it before going to a higher altitude (like a flight back to sf) you should prepare yourself for several hours being in fart-town with the population consisting of just you. But it's good and the portion is hearty and in the end I'd still say it was worth it.   Inside was more sterile and vacant than it should have been. They were out of napkins. Out of utensils. Had no condiments and it was was really hard to get someone's attention after you order.   Inside there seemed to be a strange shift change happening and employees got to sit down and eat but then there appeared to be both a manager and some sort of accountant man having strange interactions with employees. A lot of over explaining, maybe some berating and it not the best place to conduct such a thing nor did the interactions seem appropriate. It was otherwise a fine place but could certainly use some fine-tuning at the management level as far as decorum.   We definitely left wishing we'd just ordered 2 burgers (and stayed away from the quinoa bowl) and feeling bad for the employees."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place for a very long time. Well, I finally got the chance today and I was not disappointed at all. Everything there is vegan and it tastes oh so good!   I got the regular lentille soup with the chocolate zuchini brownie. The server asked if I wanted it warm and obviously, I said yes. The soup has this consistent taste and the brownie is... AMAZING. It has enough flavors in the brownie without it being too sweet. The regular soup is big enough for a meal and the brownie is enough to share with two people.   Needless to say, I got a -10.28$ on my wallet and -1.00 for the great service. The quality of the food did not disappointed me, neither is the portion size. I did expect to get small portions since healthy food is usually expensive but this place is generous. The money spent was worth it!"}
{"text":"Service incroyablement lent, espace de travail vraiment sale et désorganisé, erreur dans la commande (il en manquait la moitié)et nourriture froide, wrap falafel, pita chaud intérieur température frigo. L'îlot de service était vide d'ustensiles et plein de vaisselles sales bien que nous ne soyons que 4 clients sur place.J'aime les Copper Branch et en général le service et bien et la cuisine relativement propre sauf à cette succursale."}
{"text":"Dropped-in literally, 1 min before closing (September 5'th), had no idea they closed at 10pm, offered to leave and come back the next day because I felt bad about making the staff work later than they have to. They totally refused to let me walk away :) . Amazing service! THANK YOU!  I ordered a large poutine $11.95, \"bacon\" tofu sandwich $8.95 and drinks. Everything on the menu is vegan and Gluten-Free. The food was very flavourful, nothing was fried and all ingredients tasted very fresh. I'm so used to dealing with veg restaurants serving horribly bland food that I asked them for 2 servings of hot sauce on the side, totally didn't expect a burst of flavour every time I took a bite, didn't have to use the sauce at all.   I really wish this company would open a Toronto location, I'm sure they would do very well."}
{"text":"The food here was delicious. Hands down. I had an amazing bowl with tempeh, the Aristotle. My dining companion had a tasty sandwich. And we shared the vegan poutine. Everything was uniformly delicious, and my only sadness was that I live nowhere near Montréal. The employees were friendly, the place was clean, the food was fresh. I really don't have anything bad to say, except that it was a little expensive, but you definitely got what you paid for. And while we were dining, amazing activist Angela Davis walked in and died there too. Apparently this is a place for star gazing! I wish I could eat here everyday."}
{"text":"I would recommend trying anything with the shitake mushrooms in it - they are very tasty. However, I find Copper Branch to be a bit overpriced when compared to other options in the area (the bowls here are ~$3 more than most alternatives and are also smaller). The burgers are also a bit overpriced, but do you really have another option when it comes to plant based food in the PATH? Otherwise, I think the food can hit you quite hard and you can feel a bit bloated and lethargic after eating here.  I gave Copper Branch a try when I first started eating vegetables during the work week. My first order from Copper Branch was a portobello mushroom burger ($9.75); this turned me away from Copper Branch for quite a while. I took a bite into it and my tongue was burnt - it also was not that tasty.  Two weeks later, I got tired of ordering the exact same thing from Kupfert & Kim every day. I gave Copper Branch another try - I got the shitake teriyaki burger ($9.75). Now, this is a fairly overpriced burger, just like the first - but this one actually tasted really good.  From there on out, I actually frequented Copper Branch - I got either the general copper bowl ($14.25) or the shitake teriyaki burger ($9.75). Some times I order it with extra shitake, but I feel like it's just a bit too much at times. I don't know why, but after I eat at Copper Branch, I often feel a bit bloated and lethargic - the food is tasty though!"}
{"text":"Déjà fan de la franchise, j'ai voulu essayer leur nouveau bébé de la rue Mont-Royal.  Fit parfait sur le plateau, l'endroit est grand et très lumineux. Également, j'ai trouvé que l'endroit était TRÈS propre.   Les prix sont vraiment raisonnables, pour des bons plats végétariens préparés devant nos yeux. De nombreuses options sans gluten sont disponibles, wouhou!  Le seul point sur lequel ils doivent travailler est le service. En effet, les employés ne semblent pas tous parler français, et le gérant est omniprésent. Littéralement, les employés ont l'air de dépendre de lui pour tout, et il ne leur laisse pas beaucoup de largeur. Bien sur, c'est le début de l'établissement, un ajustement sera certainement fait."}
{"text":"Vegan poutine? Hell ya!  With all the delicious options and carbs galore in Montreal, maintaining a small semblance of a healthy diet is integral to my travel schedule. This place helps me do just that with all of its yummy vegan and vegetarian options. I love their breakfast smoothie bowls, macro bowls, salad bowls, soups and drinks. It's hard to say much more about it, but it's just good plant based items with out too many complicated and unhealthy additives. The vegan poutine as previously mentioned is a great way to get in the Montreal staple for those with dairy intolerances.   Definitely try it out!"}
{"text":"This is probably the best vegan bowl iv ever had. I was quite surprised by how fresh and delicious it was. The bowl has a basil dressing on it that I would never had thought would pair well with a Mexican style bowl. Sad that I don't live in montreal, but when I do come back to visit again I will definitely be returning to try the other items on their menu!"}
{"text":"It was a bit of a drive for me to get there but well worth it.  The servers were not only friendly but they were very helpful in describing the delicious dishes.  Food was the freshest I had tasted this winter. Somebody is doing a good job here.  I even met the manager and he was not only very personable but front and center with an apron on.  Their patio opens soon and I can't wait to drink one of their excellent selection of craft beers on it.  I will be back !"}
{"text":"TLDR: Quick, affordable, yummy vegan food.  I first went to Copper Branch after I heard of their vegan poutine and I had to try it. It was definitely on par with the animal-based poutines, but with less guilt accompanying it. I might even dare say that it was better than most of the animal-based poutines I've had. I've frequented their other locations and tried their other menu items which were also delicious. Service is always executed efficiently and with a smile. Copper Branch is my go to place when I've forgotten my lunch at home so that I can still have a healthy, tasty, and filling meal."}
{"text":"Soups are good but the bowl dishes are nothing special. Everything is way too salty. Desserts are so sweet that I couldn't eat more than two bites. I wouldn't go there again."}
{"text":"I highly recommend stopping by Copper Branch! They have a wide variety of vegetarian/vegan options on their menu, each with their own unique ingredients and flavours. Prices are reasonable and the service is fast. I wish they were in New York!"}
{"text":"I love the vegan and well-seasoned food. So whether it is their sliders or bowls or even fries, everything is just so perfect. Their coconut milk hot chocolate is really different and I loved it. The portions are decent, but for bowls and soups, they are generous. The baked fries are little less sinful and so crisp, you can't just avoid them. Black bean burger is one of my regular favourites, along with zucchini brownie and Buddha bowl.  whether you are vegetarian or not, this place deserves a shot!"}
{"text":"TERRIBLE SERVICE! Spend your money somewhere else. I wonder what kind of negligence occurs at the kitchen of a restaurant where the head of staff is disrespectful of customers at loud voice and in front of anyone who happens to walk in."}
{"text":"Was in the mood for a burger but decided to come here and try a veggie burger. Had the beet one. Very good. Don't miss the meat at all! The service was great. Guy behind the cash very helpfull"}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. The black bean burger was awesome! Gotta get it with the cheese and avocado. What's for sure is that the portion sizes are out of control here! So many fries and so much salad. Makes me wish the burger was bigger lol. I thought the fries were a little over seasoned. The workers were nice, but they must have been short on staff because the tables had fresh stains and someone's trash got moved around to the table behind us. Some almost spilled on my wife when some guy knocked over a coffee cup. Needs to be a little more cleanly, but the food was good. Just prepare for a lot!"}
{"text":"Overall great vegan food but sometimes bland. I love all their burgers and the baked fries make me feel better and not heavy. Depending on the location the staff might be friendlier."}
{"text":"Fresh colourful bowls of energy food. Tasty and diverse missing sauce perhaps butin the whole excellent"}
{"text":"love the food !! great place went i need health and tasty food fast !!!! people are nice and the service is great ! But the place is always so messy.... tables not to clean and the water bar no water or napkins.... after 4 times i guess it s always like that"}
{"text":"Vegan fast food? Apparently it's a thing now and Copper Branch has made some vegetarians very happy. Gone are the days of sacrificing a healthy meal for a quick lunch. They do have other locations downtown, however, this one is a personal favourite. The staff are always nothing but friendly and you'll always have an enjoyable experience. I've come multiple times and have on occasion ordered one of their bowls or soups. Those were good but quite average, in my opinion. However, my go-to order is the shiitake teriyaki mushroom burger (!!). Go the extra mile and replace the bun with a collard green wrap. If you'd like to indulge you can try one of their desserts, both are excellent! Copper Branch always uses fresh, high quality ingredients. I've never been disappointed and that mild sense of accomplishment you get from eating a healthy meal is unbeatable."}
{"text":"Stayed in Montreal last night and did a Yelp search of vegan places in the area. Luckily I found Copper Branch. The food was fantastic everything was flavorful seasoned and some of the best vegan food I've had in a restaurant. Not only did I eat breakfast there but I also had them cook me lunch as take out that I'm currently eating right now. This place is legit. If you are vegan and you are in Montreal you absolutely must check out this restaurant."}
{"text":"What a fabulous treat & memorable experience!! The staff, service & value was amazing, and the Plant Powered deliciousness was a lovely surprise! My wife & I are celebrating 18 yrs since the day we met, & were treated to a vegan to-die-for brownie. Please open a location in East Toronto/Beaches. We need you here!"}
{"text":"A small, vegan, and eastern Canadian chain; Cooper Branch is always a near perfect hit. Today, the bean burger I ate was delicious except for an undercooked section that was inedible. However, when cooked right, the burger is delicious! Extra points for the service, and ambiance. Free lemon induced water (something many Montreal places don't offer) was a plus. A little pricer for the quality but not the atmosphere. The smoothie I had was delicious. Visit if your in town and looking for a vegan bite."}
{"text":"Good simple vegan food! The copper burger was a fave! Also tried the black bean burger and tofu sandwich and enjoyed both!   This is one of those places to stop by when you're in a pinch or just need a bite to eat!"}
{"text":"Copper Branch offers a fast food formula for vegans on the go, akin to other bigger chains like Subway, with a focus on healthy foods.   The service is quick and the staff is polite. The location is strategic, right in the heart of downtown Montreal, and the interior design is fresh, minimalist and hipster with a touch of deliberate vintage.  During our visit, I had a sweet potato black bean burger, and my husband ordered the copper burger. Both tasted good, but if I may offer a critique, I would say the burgers would have benefited from some type of sauce or spices to enhance the taste. Prices were okay, right on the border of \"I'm not sure if I should be paying this much for a burger... and yet I just did.\"  Overall, I would still recommend Copper Branch; it might be fast food, but it's vegan, it's healthy and the taste is decent. And for that, in my book it deserves four stars. Although I am not in a rush to go back, I would certainly consider it if I were downtown and needed some quick fuel."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  Having a (almost) fast food vegan option is beyond cool.  There are a lot of soy products on the menu, which is a problem for those of us with soy sensitivities, but that's pretty standard.  The bowls and burgers are easily modified, though.  I was really happy that the staff took my questions about soy very seriously and made sure to pay attention to each step in their preparation.  I've had the galaxy burger, the sweet potato burger, the Gandhi smoothie, and the Aztec bowl, the detox juice, and the fries. Each time the items have been fresh and well made.  It seems like this is a franchise on the rise. They still have a few kinks to work out with their service and their protein options, but I am certainly impressed and excited to keep coming back!"}
{"text":"I had the Sweet Potato and Black Bean burger. One of my favourite veggie burgers so far, but I find it quite expensive for its size, and I didn't even take a drink. I give this place 4 stars for its quality, but be warned that eating here will cost you a pretty penny."}
{"text":"I've been to 2 of their restaurants in Montreal and, compared to Fresh in Toronto, it is tastier, fresher and cheaper. Highly recommend. Nice staff and nice chilled place to eat."}
{"text":"Presque trop beau pour être vrai; un excellent resto végé style fast food au centre -ville. Rapport qualité prix imbattable. Tout y est savoureux. Je ne connais personne qui y est allé et qui n'a pas aimé. Pourquoi luncher ailleurs? J'espère que cette chaîne bordera nos autoroutes un jour."}
{"text":"At first glance I thought to myself why doesn't this place have more than 3 stars, and then I reflected on my experience and I now concur.  I mean the flavor of my Shitaki burger  (really nuggets of some kind of chopped Shitake blend) was above average in the taste department. The beet slaw and faux mayo were quite a nice compliment on a sesame seeded bun, however the size of said burger was not so fulfilling.   For the price you think you might be more satiated - at least I didn't go to bed on a full stomach - filled with heavier foods like other nights. Will change that habit (good inner monologue), but not a subject for this review.     A huge disappoint was the Chai almond latte, more for the fact that it was $4.99 for a small cup of liquid that had an odd spice blend. Meaning it had neither a good Chai or Indian spiced tea taste. I figure the almond milk over whelmed the situation - or probably the price shocked my taste buds - what is this a high end tea shop or a drink at a vegan restaurant that is just over priced. Help more people become vegan. Start with welcoming prices, but again see below - I'm a newbie.  Other notes: The lemon water and clean bathroom were nice touches. The Jalapeno and Habanero hot sauces don't really fit the taste profile of what I would like to accent my vegan, but maybe I'm just a newbie."}
{"text":"I visited this place for lunch at the Robert Bourassa street. Tried their salad meal. It was good but nothing unusual. It is a good place for a veggie but not offers much belonged salads and usual sandwiches. I liked the smoothies offered by them though, with unusual names. Tried the budhdha smoothie and liked it. The place does not have a warm vibe, but it is like that with most of the food chains."}
{"text":"A dear friend of mine recently moved to Peterborough. Our midpoint to meet these days tends to be around the Oshawa area.  Whenever we go out for dinner, I am mindful that my vegan friend needs a place to suit her food needs. I simply like exploring new places to eat.  I have bookmarked Copper Branch for a while. I looked at my bookmarks and suggested that we go here. She was game, as she has also been meaning to give this place a try.  Copper Branch is located in downtown Brooklin, a bit north of Whitby. We parked on the street and walked in.  You basically order from the menu and the folks at the restaurant bring your food to your table. They jot down what colour or style of clothes that you are wearing, so they bring your food to the right people. Cool!  Everything on the menu is vegan, which made my friend so happy. She ordered the poutine with mushroom gravy and nachos, along with a San Pellegrino in orange. I ordered a portobello mushroom burger, poutine, and a Bec lime soda.  My friend shared some of her nachos with me. They were so good!   I easily get bored of fries. However, the poutine was outstanding here! The cheese was perfect. The fries tasted amazing with the mushroom gravy. There was pepper in the sauce, which was subtle.  I absolutely loved and enjoyed eating my portobello mushroom burger. I love how meaty portobello mushrooms are. You get a full cap with loads of flavour on top of it. I normally don't like eggplant, but I barely noticed it on my burger. So delicious! It is the best portobello burger I have had in my life!  My Bec lime soda was amazing. Bec is short for Quebec, which is the province where this soda is made. The lime was refreshing and had the right tanginess that I was hoping for. There is maple syrup and organic sugar in it, but it wasn't overly done like many products tend to do.   My friend and I both ordered the coconut lime cheezecake and chocolate zucchini brownie to take back home. I got another Bec soda, but in cola flavour instead.  The coconut lime cheezecake was so good. It had a great balance of creaminess, sweetness, and tartness. The brownie was heavenly - lots of chocolate flavour in each bite. I am not big on zucchini, but I didn't notice it at all. I suppose that all the chocolate chips helped mask it, too.  I do like the Bec brand of sodas. The cola is equally as yummy as the lime.  You have the option to dine in or take out. Folks are helpful and friendly at this restaurant. It's a nice, casual place to sit down and chat for hours with good company.  I highly recommend coming here. I left feeling full and happy.  (170)"}
{"text":"Visited this place after a long drive from  Toronto. Ordered the falafel wrap, power bowl  and Asian fusion bowl. Really delicious! It is all vegan and I am not even vegan so it is really great . Maybe I will become one  since the food is so tasty"}
{"text":"If you must, if you're starved, if you're vegan.   The flavours are good, don't get me wrong, but for a literally TEENY WEENY burger AVEC ZERO......they're making a small fortune. Talking about $9-10 CAD for a mini burger.   The two burgers we had were great, but left us hungry and we had to leave to go eat at another vegan spot that had larger portions for less $$$$$.   Decent quality, decent location, marginally clean space, marginally friendly staff. In a pinch, I would hit it again."}
{"text":"Went for dinner with my girlfriend, not your typical sit in restaurant.The setup is abit confusing at first but we figured it out for ourselves. It also took way too long to get our drinks (alcohol). I would go again but for lunch. Had the General Copper Bowl, was amazed by the texture of the shitake mushroom (like a crispy chicken thigh) but the general sauce wasn't very good and the rest of the bowl was bland. Poutine was very good for being vegan. Spicy black bean burger wasnt any better than a frozen store bought one, although the homemade southwest sauce is killer. Altogether I will defenitly go again, just not for a Saturday night out."}
{"text":"Copper Branch est un bel ajout au Plateau. Gardez toutefois en tête que ce n'est pas Aux Vivres ou Crudessence. Même si l'endroit est agréable et que les plats proposés sont de qualité, on reste dans de la restauration rapide! Le service est OK, les employés ont parfois un peu de mal en français et ils ne semblent pas tous être très à l'aise avec les différents items du menu. Comptez environ 15$ pour un lunch (sans la boisson). Évitez toutefois les desserts, ils n'ont pas beaucoup de goût."}
{"text":"J'ai été très surprise de tomber face à face avec ce resto! En plein food court du carrefour Laval, c'est une belle option santé et végé! Il y a des choix de bols énergisants, de burgers et de sandwich. Tout est vegan. J'ai opté pour le bol Aztec, avec patates douces, tomates, haricots noirs, chips de mais, avocats, carottes, betteraves, crème sure et plein d'autres bons aliments. Ces ingrédients sont la base du bol. On choisit ensuite quelle est la base qu'on veut (quinoa, riz, laitue, etc.) J'ai choisi laitue. Et on termine en choisissant notre protéine (Tempeh, tofu, etc). J'ai choisi le tofu fumé. La vinaigrette était au basilic. Le bol et la vinaigrette étaient super frais, rafraîchissant, rassasiant et goûteux. Il faut faire attention, il faut préciser quel format on veut, sans quoi on nous donne automatiquement le format régulier (environ 12$). J'ai préféré le format appelé \"mini\" (environ 9$). La portion était amplement suffisante. Mon conjoint a choisi le sandwich au tofu à l'érable. C'était un peu plus décevant. Pas très gouteux, malgré que la sauce était intéressante et faisait assez confort food. Pour nos 2 plats, il nous a coûté 20$ pile. Sans avoir eu de wow, je trouve le concept intéressant et j'apprécie grandement d'avoir la possibilité de manger sainement dans un food court de centre d'achat, sans me ruiner. J'y retournerais et je le conseille à tous! On laisse de côté le burger ou la pointe de pizza pour une fois, ok?"}
{"text":"Do not eat here at lunch - it's just too busy and too small to accommodate a lineup. The staff seems to get very overwhelmed if there are too many orders placed. I waited over 25 minutes today for the wrong order. Very disappointed when I got back to my desk - and a half-full box at that (which had happened before). I love the food here though, and it's a nice veggie option to have downtown. The scrambled tofu on the Aztec bowl is a great pick. Advice: eat here, in-house (where they are likely to fill up your bowl to a visibly reasonable amount) - and avoid lunchtime lineups!"}
{"text":"Awesome food! Quality is a must and they know how to serve deliciousness combination its a great vegan restaurant I love the flavor and after going 5 times i'm always satisfied so I will be investing my money again because I love places like that that care about health and cruelty free meal!so far I had the cooper branch burger awesome and the energized bowl are devine my favorite is the medditeraneo"}
{"text":"On m'a fortement recommandé ce restaurant et je n'ai pas été déçue! J'ai commandé le General Copper (des champignons dans une sauce général tao végétarienne avec riz brun, brocolis, avocats, salade de chou) et c'était super bon! La portion est généreuse et j'étais vraaaiment pleine après mon repas. J'ai trouvé la salade de chou un peu trop vinaigrée à mon goût mais on s'habitue après quelques bouchées.   Il y a une petite terrasse parfaite pour un jour d'été ensoleillé! Le service est rapide et ils ont même des bières bio!   On aime!"}
{"text":"Suuuuper good vegan fast food! I was really impressed!  I took the mini Aristotle energy bowl on brown rice with tempeh. The seasoning was really good, and the tempeh amazing. My friend took the vegan poutine (the sauce was exceptional, the portion a bit small to his taste) and the Gandhi smoothie (a bit too much ginger to my taste)."}
{"text":"Great vibe and friendly staff. Perfect for a casual lunch, or to pop open the laptop with a latte. Copper Branch: Thank you for helping us not miss downtown cafés too much. :)"}
{"text":"Seconde visite dans une succursale Copper Branch hier, et un second bon repas!   Commande et paiement au comptoir, puis on apporte son cabaret à l'une des tables pour manger. Les condiments et de l'eau sont disponibles à une station en \"libre-service\". Un bon compromis entre \"restauration-rapide\" et \"p'tit décor accueillant\".  Mon amie m'a fait goûter sa sauce à poutine aux champignons qui n'était absolument pas plate. Au contraire, c'était épicé, la texture était crémeuse et la température à laquelle elle était servie faisait bien fondre le fromage.   Je me suis régalée du sandwich au tempeh à l'érable et aux mangues. Pas cher pour la quantité et la qualité des garnitures. Le pain ciabatta sur lequel il m'a été servi avait le ratio gagnant moelleux/croustillant et il était tiède, miam.    J'apprécie toujours manger dans de la vraie vaisselle avec des ustensiles de métal. C'est conséquent avec les valeurs saines et environnementales de l'entreprise aussi, bravo!  J'ai retiré une étoile, très honnêtement, parce que je respecte tous les choix d'alimentation. Je ne suis pas contre la promotion du végétalisme, qui est légitime et dont on peut vanter des bienfaits. Cependant, je n'aime pas me faire parler \"d'aliments puissants\" ou \"d'aliments essentiels\". Ça ressemble à de la propagande où manger végétalien = manger sainement."}
{"text":"What a awesome surprise. I am not vegan, I eat meat and love it. However, I have made some changes and eating a lot healthier more balanced meals. I gave this a try and was very pleasantly surprised. I will go back 100% and recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"I went to Copper Branch Westmount Saturday night and it was delicious. I  wasn't sold on vegan food but I definitely am now. The place is beautiful (brand new), the food was great, and the staff were friendly. Will be returning."}
{"text":"I am usually very constructive in my reviews but here it's impossible.  The food is gross... Everything I tried was terrible... To the point it made me nauseous. The galaxy burger is a sloppy mess with raw eggplant and semi cooked mushroom and a very strong fake cheese. Sauce in the burger smells like melted plastic. Fries are baked but very greasy, soft and tasteless.   I am not vegan... But Montreal has delicious vegan restaurants.  Stay away"}
{"text":"Copper Branch offers good \"fast food\" for vegans, and people who can't eat gluten. There are several locations throughout downtown Montreal, which can be very convenient when you're in a bind and have many food restrictions. They also deliver. With that said, whenever I get an order delivered from this establishment, 99% of the time it's wrong. I have even called back a few times and been told that nothing can be done or that a manager will get back to me, but that's never happened. The food is also excessively oily sometimes. When eating in, the employees are usually pretty nice and helpful. I have noticed that most of them just play on their phones and socialize though, which can appear very unprofessional.   To be completely honest, I do enjoy the variety of food offered here, but there are much better options at other vegan establishments."}
{"text":"We've been to this location 3 times. Never disappoints. First the staff is very friendly and efficient. The place is always clean. And although most of the times their is a line up. We never waited for more than 5-10 min max. Very fast in bringing out the food. Now the food we've tried all their bowls. They're all delicious. Always fills us up. Fresh vegetables. This one in the picture is the general copper. You can easily mistake the shitakes for meat. Its unbelievable how tasty they are. We've had their oven fries twice,  very tasty love the seasoning and not fried! All in all this place is great. Would love to see more options, in the protein section and in the bowls, it seems most ingredients repeat themselves except for a very few and dressings should be more choices. But for fast food vegan its a great place!"}
{"text":"Food is great but service is too slow for a 'fast food' joint. The two guys in the back are working their butts off trying to prepare the food and they can't catch up with the amount of people in line. HIRE MORE PEOPLE"}
{"text":"Shiitake Teriyaki Sandwich good and the breakfast too."}
{"text":"Good food BUT the staff is poorly informed about which items have gluten.  The allergy sheets are not up to date and I was told the Shiitake Teriyaki was gluten-free, then found out the next day it was not.  After I ate it, no real apologies were made, and nothing was done to make up the fact you fed me gluten when it causes damage to my body."}
{"text":"Above-average Vegan fare.  Had the Copper burger and it was very good, the patty is a beet and brown rice mixture served on a bun with carmelized onions and alfalfa sprouts.  The atmosphere was modern and clean, walk-up service was efficient and friendly.  Glad to see the place bustling during Monday lunchtime in a downtown business area!"}
{"text":"The guy messed up my order. Asked for the Asian Fusion salad bowl to go. My bowl missed the kimchi and there were no beets. Plus, something in the salad smelled off, like it had gone bad. Maybe it was the tomato salsa thing. It was meh. Wouldn't come back to this location again"}
{"text":"I'd prefer it if it wasn't a franchise because it feels quite soulless. Anyhow it's great that this vegan eatery seems to be successful because the food is really tasty. The burgers are delicious but are quite expensive since they don't even come with fries on the side. We left a little hungry but I'm sure I'll return another time to try their other exciting vegan dishes."}
{"text":"Pleaseeeee bring this to the US! Vegan fast(-ish) food at decent prices is the dream I never knew I had. We tried one of the bowls, the vegan chili, and vegan nachos. Everything was well seasoned and filling and fresh."}
{"text":"Wonderful to see that Montreal can support a chain of vegan restaurants, when Buffalo doesn't even have one. We found this restaurant clean and bright, with lots of seating inside and out. After challenging ourselves with the French menu, we found the English menu on the counter. They were out of my oldest daughter's first choice--the shiitake teriyaki sandwich, so she settled for my choice, a galaxy burger--a portobello mushroom cap on a distinctive bun. The mushroom itself was not so distinctive, and she left a good bit of her sandwich on the plate. My youngest couldn't find anything tempting, so she had the side of hummus with bread. She enjoyed the bread, and ate most of the hummus, but it came with no other vegetables or garnish. We shared the poutine in mushroom gravy. It was ok--our first since we arrived for our vacation. I found a stone in it as I took the last bite--so glad my daughters didn't get it. Luckily I didn't bite into it, and I didn't feel the need to complain.  Overall, the experience was ok. We'd probably go back if it were a matter of convenience, but not as a destination."}
{"text":"Travelling always puts a strain on your diet, so it's always nice to come across a healthier vegetarian restaurant on my trips to offset the daily diet of not-so-healthy fat-laden restaurant food. I was here on a Sunday morning for breakfast which the only people other than myself there was a family, and there was only one staff member working there which made for a somewhat slow service. This was fine as they have free WiFi (the password is on your receipt) which gave me some time to catch up on my emails. This is a fast casual restaurant, which means you order and pay at the counter first and someone will call you to pick up your meal, so service was just average and the person working there seemed very disinterested.  The self-serve water tasted extremely off-putting, which had a weird bitter and plastic-y taste to it which I am not sure if it's from the overdue slices of limes in the water jug or from the plastic cup. It almost ruined my appetite which made me feel more impatient on my food as I couldn't get the awful taste out of my mouth.  I had the smoothie bowl, which was really nice concept and tasted really nice and tasted fresh though the fruits were made from frozen. The homemade granola was also very good and provided well needed texture and substance to this cold soup-like meal. I could have wished the portion was a bit larger or had more granola as it wasn't a very hearty breakfast. I had a cup of the organic orange juice which didn't taste fresh and was a bit on the sour side -- it reminded me of canned Dole orange juice I had when I was a kid which is not a good thing. My coffee with coconut milk was good though.    Avoid sitting near the window as it was extremely cold -- I don't know if it's because of the drafty windows or because their ventilation system was blowing cold air during a cold winter spell. I was initially excited about going to this restaurant but with met with overwhelming disappointment."}
{"text":"I had the teriyaki shiitake burger and it was AMAZING!! It tasted savory and meaty! Only problem was the price :( 10$ for a small burger that didn't fill me up"}
{"text":"uncooked sweet patatoes turned me off, the rest is ok, the Aztek bol i had was desapointing filled with cheap mesclun to look voluminious but it has no taste, the sauce that goes with it is very average comparable to a cheaper version of Aux vivre's. The only thing i liked in the bol was the protein i choose called Shitake Teriyaki which i can buy at the supermarket. I also ordered the shitake burger, worst burger ever i would think its a patty but no just a half sliced shitaki btw bread with mayo. This place has no soul, it's a chain i didn't expect much to start with but c'mon people are smarter than that. Some fast cheap food \"vegatarian\" food is not what eating healthy means to me. A chain in the Plateau has the balls to come here, insulted."}
{"text":"One of my favorite vegan places.  So far I have tried their matcha lime smoothie bowl, their breakfast wrap and their matcha coconut latte and all are delish.  I still have to go back and try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"I didn't even know this place existed and I'm so happy it does.  I just had their matcha lime smoothie bowl and it was matcha-licious!!!!!  Can't wait to go back and try their other vegan meals.  They're super quick too with serving the food which a thumbs up on my book.  I just wish it was closer to Pickering.  That's the only thing that makes me sad.  :("}
{"text":"A great vegetarian experience! The Mushroom Galaxy Burger was phenomenal and filling; I didn't try the fries (low carb diet) but I did get the quinoa chili  yummmm! Counter service and complimentary lemon/lime water! The weather was beautiful so I sat outside! Noon hits and it gets packed! Just goes to show how delicious healthy food is!"}
{"text":"It's all pretty ok, but not very interesting. Convenient location. The faux chicken wings were quite good, but very pricey. Everything else I tried was kind of bland."}
{"text":"Copper Branch is a staple vegan restaurant chain in Montreal.  The burgers are portobello caps (yum) and the food was generally good, but not amazing.  The smoothies are good and they offer hemp protein to help bulk it up a little, which was appreciated.  Overall, I was just surprised that these restaurants never seem busy.  Staff are pretty friendly and the menu is not too expensive, but portions are on the small side, so you may need to order more than you think."}
{"text":"Creative vegetarian menu with lots of choices. serving breakfast. Bowls are good, can customize. Fast service for being fresh. Coffee like drinks have sugar pre mixed so minus one star."}
{"text":"Bel endroit ensoleillé pour s'installer étudier, les plats sont colorés et végétaliens (enfin, on n'a pas à se casse la tête pour trouver une option végé!) J'ai essayé le bol général Cooper, c'est épicé et j'ai bien aimé! Les cafés sont abordables. Enfin un endroit qui ne surchage pas la totale pour une alternative vegan!  Le service est sympathique, mais je confirme les autres avis; ils ne semblent pas comprendre très bien le français. Quand j'ai dit que c'était ma première fois et que j'avais entendu parler du \"poulet\" fait de shitake on m'en a donné un échantillon pour goûter. Ils m'ont conseillé un minimum et donc ont gagné un point pour le côté sympathique, ils essaient ;)"}
{"text":"As a strict vegetarian who enjoys seasoned, tasty food (for some reason, a lot of vegan restaurants seem to think they can forego flavour?) Copper Branch is a real godsend! It's so exciting to see a chain-like vegan company expanding all over the city while offering a delicious alternative to other big box fast food restaurants.  My most recent meal from Copper Branch was the tofu and grilled vegetable sandwich with a side vegan brownie. I got it delivered to my apartment and was a bit nervous as I made a note to include no eggplant or tomato (food intolerance problems) and requested it to be replaced with other vegetables. To my surprise and delight, they pulled through without a hitch!  This flavour-packed sandwich was plenty with grilled zucchini, sweet potato, onions and a melty swiss-style vegan cheese. Yum! I shared half with my omnivore boyfriend - who is always skeptical of new vegan places - and I kid you not, he immediately blurted out, \"Wow! Ok! I LOVE Copper Branch\".  Oh yeah. Don't even get me started on the brownie. This zucchini-based piece of heaven is just as sweet and satisfying as its traditional counterpart but it's completely vegan friendly and relatively healthy in comparison to your average brownie.  The only downside is that it's quite expensive for what you get. This is very common among vegan restaurants though - so don't let it deter you from trying it out! Your stomach will thank you!"}
{"text":"Loved the concept of v/gf and especially because it felt like also clean eating! Portions were right size, flavors were great, menu variety was awesome!"}
{"text":"Scam. Never again. Paid $16 for a shitake burger and a bottle of RISE. All it was, was one big ass piece of mushroom that slid off the burger every time I took a bite."}
{"text":"I love copper branch! They never disappoint. Everything is very flavourful and the staff are extremely friendly. I would recommend this place to vegans and non vegans alike!"}
{"text":"We got the Bombay Soup, which was nothing but the Indian \"Daal Tadka\" and the Aristotle bowl. The Daal was okay but the bowl had refreshing flavours. The price was above average, but in line with other vegan restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"One of my favourite copper branch locations! The staff is so friendly, and very fast compared to some of the other locations (west island/Dix30). I have yet to taste anything on the menu I didn't like. I highly recommend the scrambled tofu sandwich for breakfast, and the shiitake sandwich for lunch. Is it pricey? Yes, but worth it as far as I'm concerned. You pay for what you get, everything tastes very fresh and so amazing!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Vegan and gluten free, and they offer so many options! I had the Fusion Asiatique (Asian Fusion) bowl and it was really tasty! I had some trouble ordering because their digital menu is in French and I speak no French, but the staff was very nice and patient and helped with explaining each item. I agree with Jenn A, please come to NYC, I'd be a regular!"}
{"text":"My sis and I went to the Copper Branch at the dix30 in Brossard. OMG soooo yummy! Tots gonna be a pit stop everytime I'm visiting her. We split the Southwest BlackBean Burger which was absolutely delicious and a General Copper Bowl (faux General Tao's chicken) which was really really good. We decided that we want to try everything on the menu. I also bought their mango hot sauce but haven't tried it yet."}
{"text":"Was super excited to try out this place, as it was close to our hotel and seemed like an innovative vegan fast-food type place. I ordered the tofu scramble breakfast sandwich, which was the type of food that doesn't taste vegan (or healthy!) at all but actually had very clean ingredients (I liked how the website listed the ingredients and nutrition of all the items on the menu). The sauce in particular was really good. My mom got the smoothie bowl, which seemed to be lacking some toppings and was poorly presented, but also tasted very good. She also got a coffee, which the staff forgot about but quickly got when we reminded them. Service wasn't great, but the food was, so I would probably go back here and try a few other things."}
{"text":"I want to drown in a vessel full of their bombay soup! It's so delicious and fulfilling that unfortunately I couldn't get to eat anything else here... Will visit again for sure."}
{"text":"Obsessed with the shiitake teriyaki and cole slaw. So delicious! Wish I could eat here every day, and certainly would if I lived in Montreal. The only thing I've had that I didn't care for was the tempeh, which doesn't have much flavor, but the Copper bowl (sub kale for rice), fruit smoothies, and the avocado toast (ask for some dressing) are all delicious!"}
{"text":"Loved this place got one of the bowls and ate every bit of it. Lasted me for hours and I wasn't hungry and I walked around Montreal for hours with the fuel this bowl gave me! Highly recommend you stop buy and get something anything to eat. The zucchini brownie is the bomb!"}
{"text":"J'aimerais bien donner un 5 étoiles car la nourriture est excellente et j'adore encourager un resto qui ne fait pas de mal aux animaux mais, même sir la rue Mt-Royal les employés parlent anglais, l'assiette brunch du matin est petite et le café dans un verre de carton....."}
{"text":"Petite sucursale bien cachée en plein centre ville et qui réponds bien à la qualité du service et des produits de ce restaurant."}
{"text":"Il y a plusieurs succursales de ce restaurant fast food vegan. Je préfère personnellement La Panthère verte pour ce genre de resto mais j'ai ma carte fidélité Copper Branch car je crois qu'il faut encourager tous ces restos vegan. Un peu cher mais très bon."}
{"text":"Here is the thing, I am pleasantly surprised with the food off the Copper Branch and I can really see myself returning sometime in the future. But there are two major problems with this place.   Firstly: It's expensive. Relatively small portions for relatively large portions of my money. I am a student. I don't have a job. I'm basically still entirely reliant on my parents and student loans. I shower less than I would like to. It's hard to get up in the morning sometimes. I drink way more than I should. Im having a lot of trouble quitting smoking. I'm still absolutely engrossed in the psychological burden of failed past relationships. And the frequency that I have to pee has become pretty alarming over the last two years, I called to schedule a doctors appointment but no one picked up.   Second: There are roaches here! This is a major major problem. Pic attached.  Edit: Just got up to get water, there is lemon and cucumber in it. I love that. Pic attached.  Edit: I actually shower quite a lot, it's more that the timing of my showers is totally off. I'll shower in the morning, then go on a run or a swim and then it becomes more difficult to get that second shower in. I can't spend all day in the shower, I have other things to do. I should be showering after I workout. Another thing, it's been so humid here lately that I pretty always feel like I need a shower. I'll get used to it. God it's been so hard to sleep. Just gotta go fully nude on top of your sheets like a slippery snail. The heat really generates some crazy dreams cause your basically perpetually in that state of sleep-purgatory."}
{"text":"It was the first time my partner and I try Copper Branch and we found it excellent. We tried several items on the menu and were impressed by the quality, the taste, and the variety of options available, and we were positively surprised by the size of the dishes that were larger than we expected. It was ready pretty fast too!  Our experience had started badly as a small incident happened with an employee, luckily we  decided to talk with the manager and he and the other employee worked out the situation to our satisfaction. We were very happy with the service as well at the end.  We will return and we recommend this place to vegans and non-vegans equally! I think everyone would appreciate the food as the meals are both very tasty and satisfying! The decoration of this branch is also very nice and I appreciate other things like the availability of a list of the dishes containing common allergens, for example, or recycled paper in the bathroom, among others."}
