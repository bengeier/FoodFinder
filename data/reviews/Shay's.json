{"text":"After watching American Splendor, I was intrigued by Shay's Diner. 
Don't be off-put  by the d√©cor.  
Smile as you walk inside and be greeted by a warm team of  \"so glad you found us\" servers.
Simply act like you've been here before. 
Smile, wave and sit yo ass down.

Once you find a good parking spot, the second you walk through the \"not feeling so safe\" doors, you feel SAFE. Seats are lined with local cops, lawyers and clinic doctors. So if some craziness goes down, you are not only  covered, you are treated and represented. 

The wait staff is friendly and Got They Sh#t together! 
As old as this place is..no place is more progressive and loving. Shay's embraces the purpose and devine meaning \"breaking bread\".

The front and back team work in harmony to deliver exactly what you want....super fast. 

I love this place. wish it was closer.

Try the pork chops, half grits/home fries soft scrambled eggs. 

Soak in the urban landscape, cuz this experience IS NOT to be found west of the valley view bridge?
I defy any place on Cleveland's west side to make an east side feel more welcomed.
The best breakfast ever!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to shays for years. Always friendly service. Excellent food. Will continue to come here"}
{"text":"Man, I hate to do this review. When I used to work in this area I used to eat breakfast here all the time. And occasionally lunch. Went there today because I was down that way for lunch and it was just terrible. I wont even get to the service because it was mediocre but tolerable. But I ordered the Shay Burger and it had absolutely no flavor as if they used zero seasoning. One piece of bacon on my burger (which was a first for me ever seeing that) and although it had mushrooms and cheese on it i couldn't taste any of the flavor. And lastly for my meal the fries were undercooked. How do you under cook fries?? My wife's fish sandwich looked worse than a Fish Filet from McDonalds.  After the waitress brought it out she asks...\"did you want cheese on that\".  And it was tasteless.  I guess I can scratch Shay's off my list."}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast joints Great food low price short wait every time . Feed the family or yourself whatever for a great price."}
{"text":"On the cold rainy Sunday of 12/27/15 a few friends and I gathered at Shay's for breakfast...I've heard many good things about this spot especially the food and after going there I see why.....We got there about 8 or so which means for a Sunday it was crowded at all since the Christmas holiday had just passed....our waitress was friendly and fast with the order....the food came out piping hot and correct....we ate good and laughed good so much that we agreed to make this our monthly thing to do on Sunday.....so if you're looking for good food and prices check out Shay's hours are Mon - Fri:5:00 am - 2:00 pm and Sat:6:00 am - 2:00 pm.....you'll be back....I know I will!"}
{"text":"Great place for cheap good food there Shay buger special is the best burger deal in town."}
{"text":"Great little \"hole in the wall\" diner.  The people are nice, quick service, large portions of home cooked food. A little rough as far as ambiance, but if good breakfast or lunch is what you need, Shay's has it."}
{"text":"Shay's is an ok greasy spoon. About average grease levels. 
I came in here once to try it after having been dazzled next door at Annie and Earl's. I got a Belgian style waffle. I got some strawberry topping and a coffee. It was all alright, but came out to more than $7, which to me seems pretty high for this kind of a place.

Ambiance is \"normal\" for a greasy spoon diner. As with every greasy diner in Asiatown, the clientele is delightfully diverse."}
{"text":"Shay's a pretty solid go to spot. The food is always inexpensive, never greasy tasting, and they cook up some pretty good tasting turkey sausage. Parking is limited, but the nice size portions once you get your food makes up for it. This place is definitely no IHOP, which says alot if your tired of going to fast food chains. Shay's is as down home as it gets and for that reason i'll keep going back."}
{"text":"I found this place the same way I found Slyman's, a Cleveland Teamster took me here and I'm glad he did. This review is only based on breakfast and if I come back it will be for breakfast. The other menu items didn't peak my interest.

The breakfasts here are awesome! It's strictly old school Americana so don't expect fancy but do expect a huge breakfast, most dishes come with three eggs.  You can get steak and eggs or pork chops and eggs for under $10 here. I had the steak and eggs and was surprised how good it was for the price. Even for double the price, I would have been happy. It's a great place for working folks to grab a bite before getting back to work. 

I would recommend Shay's for an breakfast experience that will take you back in time while satisfying your hunger."}
{"text":"Pretty good greasy spoon diner. Generous portions. Nice staff. We are truck drivers and we eat where we can. I review restaurants as to whether they fulfill what they aspire to be. Shay's has a nice, relaxed neighborhood diner feel with absolutely no pretentions. No hipsters, just working folks like us. They keep the hot coffee coming and have big pork chops and good blueberry pancakes. One could do far worse."}
{"text":"Met a client here for breakfast due to lack of time. Picked this spot randomly after another place I usually go to down there was closed for the day. I was happy overall with what I ordered which was the Krazy omelette. I prefer smaller mom and pop breakfast spots opposed to chains. The omelette came with half and half orders of home fries and grits which were delicious. Overall the meal was good, felt like something my mother would whip up in the kitchen."}
{"text":"I love this place....good portions with old school service and charm. I love the Halal omlett. The Porkchops and eggs are also a special treat. Being down here reminds me that its not technology that builds Cleveland and make our lives better....Its the people and and good food!"}
{"text":"I went on an overnight trip to Cleveland on Saturday for a mini getaway. 

After a long night of drinking, I was in dire need of some breakfast this morning. While I normally love brunch, alcohol was the furthest thing from my mind. My boyfriend and I drove around searching for somewhere to eat that didn't involve paying for parking. I consider it really lucky that we stumbled upon Shay's. 

The unpretentious diner was full of a diverse crowd getting their morning meals on. We were seated right away by the friendly waitstaff, and our drink orders were taken promptly. My coffee was fresh and hot, and they kept the refills coming. 

Their portions were very large, and really inexpensive for all that we got. Because I was hungover, I ordered a huge breakfast of a Belgian waffle with strawberries, bacon, eggs and toast. It was all perfectly cooked, and was really delicious. I didn't come close to finishing it all, but it wasn't for lack of trying! My bf ordered a sandwich called the Polish Boy - a regional favorite consisting of kielbasa, coleslaw, french fries, and bbq sauce on the sandwich. It didn't appeal to me at all, but he said it was delicious. 

Best of all, our meal came to $16 - less than the cost of one person for brunch, any given weekend. It wasn't a fancy place, but it definitely did the trick. I'd go back in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"My coworker and I went in for a quick bite and let's just say, I was not disappointed. It is one of those \"greasy spoon\" spots that's worth overlooking the debris on the floor because the food is good.
We order calzones and when I tell you they were the size and weight of a newborn...okay not really but they were big AND every bit was full of meat, cheese, and flavor. EVERY BITE! Mine was a bit burnt and it was STILL good. 
The prices are very reasonable and the staff was cool. When I say cool, I'm talking informal, but still professional. I would go again."}
{"text":"Brilliant! Nothing less describes the food, service and value. Yesterday, Sunday, the Owners and their son, Mason, were working the floor and running the kitchen - with terrific courtesy and warmth!"}
{"text":"One day I passed the time away reading Cleveland food blogs. As I am in this part of town several times a week I was happy to find bloggers praise Shay's. The old-fashioned platters of meat loaf, turkey, or roast beef served with gravy and mashed potatoes were described in mouth watering terms. The cheeseburger was nothing short of a culinary discovery. To add to the attraction bloggers claimed this was a place that served a highly diverse customer base. Economic and racial barriers are crossed at the Shay counter, booths, and small tables. 

On my one and only visit I found none of the above the least bit supported. I did find my waitress friendly and helpful. When asked she informed me Shay's serves processed turkey. Not much is cheaper or easier than roast turkey but restaurants have latched on to processed turkey like a Kardashian on a dollar. I had hoped Shay's did not. The hamburger and fries were typical of those found at a restaurant food service. As for diverse customers, on my visit I was the only diverse customer. 

Prices are very low, Shay's offers plain old American food in an area with mostly Asian restaurants. The menu is loaded with favorite diner foods. The premises are typical of an old luncheonette. It has a lot going for it with one important exception, the food."}
{"text":"Their service was great.. I got a gyro sandwich with fries and the food was excellent it was simple and nkt to heavy love a light gyro sometimes and that was perrrfect."}
{"text":"Excellent comfort food and you'd be surprised but the Spaghetti and Meatballs, Calzones, Pizza, Philly Cheesesteak, and of course The Shay Burger are all awesome!! Reasonable prices too. :)"}
{"text":"As seen in the movie \"American Splendor,\" about the life and times of Cleveland's own Harvey Pekar, comic book artist of everyday life. 

A classic, blue collar diner. Everything you could want in a Cleveland institution that seems to have not changed much in decades. 

Solid food, good prices."}
{"text":"Always a must when I come to Cleveland...but I love diners so this is definitely a mom and pop. Food is great...especially Corned Beef!"}
{"text":"Come early on Sunday the church people fill this joint up. Good food and prices . I had the 3 eggs  scrambled with cheese . toast was kind of stale. Just get there early."}
{"text":"This is a place to go for a good cheap breakfast. Not always the best service, but the food is outstanding. The Beef Omelette is the best deal with a 50/50 as a side. Have been coming here for years and the early bird gets the best meals."}
{"text":"Incredible food, reasonable prices, and friendly service, all of which contributed to an amazing dining experience. If you're looking for a chill place in Cleveland to get a great bite, this is it!!"}
{"text":"Although this place isn't the cleanest, or prettiest, the food is really good, and the employees are so kind. For less than $7.00, I got bacon, scrambled eggs, grits, home fries and toast. I also liked that the service was quick! I would recommend it!"}
