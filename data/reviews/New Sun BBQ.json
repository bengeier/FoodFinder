{"text":"Average at best. I've been to this place a few times because I keep forgetting when Ho Ho BBQ in the same plaza is open/closed. 

I had the BBQ Pork and Roast Pork on rice. The BBQ pork wasn't too bad, but was definitely dryer than I've had from other places. The worst part of this was the roast pork. It was overly fatty and by the time I was finished my food, half of the actual meat i received was pure fat that I obviously didn't eat. What made it even worse was the rice, they added too much water and it was soggy. 

It's nice they give you soup or soya drink for free, but all BBQ places do this nowadays. 

If you're in the same plaza, I would advise you to go to Ho Ho BBQ. The entrance is outside. Their food is better at the same price. 

1.5 stars for the BBQ pork, everything else was bad.. just bad."}
{"text":"I actually found this restaurant while I was looking for another BBQ restaurant but decided that I would try it. There wasn't much of a line up when I got there but it was busy when I left. 

Here's what I noticed:

The restaurant is inside the food court of this mini mall, I don't actually know the name of it. It is near one of the exits and doesn't appear to be the only one in the mall that serves Chinese BBQ; however, it is the only one in the food court. The seating area was small and when a couple of people were standing, it made it harder to navigate through. For this, I don't blame the restaurant. 

The kitchen looks cramped and haggard. The BBQ meats on the display take up a lot of room leaving a small window to have your order taken and to receive the order. It started to get cramped and people were shifting all over to accommodate people ordering and picking up their food while they were waiting. 

The prices were low; however, the cashier is no stranger to upselling and was able to upsell me on a BBQ Duck leg, which had more meat, but she charged me an additional $2. I realize $2 wasn't a lot but when you consider the price of my meal was $6, that's a substantial increase. I didn't bother ordering a drink. The cashier had a heavy provincial accent which made her hard to understand her Cantonese, so, I just agreed with her. My opinion is that I want food, and you have it, here's what I would like, how much?

The \"butcher\" or the cook in the back seemed like he was cramped and huddled inwards but he was working to get the meals done. He asked the cashier multiple times what people ordered, so, perhaps, he was the reason that we were all waiting. It's interesting because he really isn't cooking anything. 

The food was good. However, let's be more specific. The rice was flavorful but the consistency might have been off. This could have been because of the BBQ sauce that they put over it. Vegetables were very simple, just a boiled nappa cabbage on one side of the rice bowl. The take out container that I refer to the rice bowl was smaller than I am used to. The BBQ duck leg, had a lot of meat and was very flavorful, so, I was satisfied with that. The Roasted Pork meat was fall off the bone, if that is possible; however, the skin was burn and tough to eat. There was no sauce offered or given, which is sad, because everything has a perfect condiment. The soup was what I expected. If you don't like soup, she also offered soya milk. 

This restaurant is very reasonable, relatively quick and close to what I would expect for a Chinese BBQ restaurant. It isn't without its flaws but I give it a pass."}
{"text":"Ho Ho was closed.  Roast pork on rice was $5 plus tax.  Meat was tender, but skin was removed and placed overtop the pieces of meat in four longish strips.  Then, sauce was drizzled on top making some of the skin soggy.  Not cool.  The skin was also kind of salty.  A side of braised napa cabbage was ok.  If Ho Ho was open, I wouldn't have come here."}
{"text":"I actually came here to look for HoHo BBQ after reading about it in Gourmet Magazine and NOW Magazine as one of the best Chinese BBQ in the city, but unfortunately it was closed on a Sunday eve.

But what was open was another BBQ place in the Chinese food court in the same complex.

New Sun BBQ was about to close, and the proprietor was all over me as soon as I stepped into the food court and talked me into ordering their 3 meat bbq platter with rice and soy milk drink for $5.99

I got the roasted duck, steamed white chicken and roasted pork.  I got really boney pieces for the duck and chicken so I wasn't the most happy camper.  They probably gave me what was left of a chicken drum stick portion cut chinese style.   As for the duck I think I had about 4 pieces at most.

The pork was a little over done, but I was probably going to be out of luck for good pieces since it was closing time, and I didn`t look like a regular.  It`s a big thing to be a regular so that you`re always getting the best pieces.

The bathrooms at this food court definitely qualifies for one of the scarier ones in the city.  Why can`t there be a clean asian food court somewhere in this city?!?!?!

Anyways, it was okay, but I`m stuck still waiting to try HoHo BBQ.  Santa, I`ll be there soon I promise!"}
{"text":"I got the roasted chicken with noodles and soup for about 5 dollars. What I say? The food here is cheap with great portion sizes. The meat is relatively good in size, number of pieces, and flavour, so I would opt to just get the meat alone. The noodles I got with my roasted chicken was a tad bit soggy and you could tell that they put very little thought into the quality of the noodles they purchase in bulk.  The soup you pour over the noodles and chicken was light. The soup honestly just tasted like boiled cabbage with chicken broth and a pinch of salt, a bit too light for my tastes  (note: I don't even like heavy broths).  It didn't seem to harmonize  well with my roasted  chicken. In fact, the soup watered down the taste of the chicken rather than enhancing it. Overall, this is a decent place to swing by for some cheap eats, but again, opt for just the meat alone."}
{"text":"While \"others\" come back from Trips to start indulging in Sushi, I get back to basics more affordable consumption methods.  Plain old BBQ Rice Box at New Sun BBQ.  While the 1 item BBQ Rice Box cost $4.50, the interestingly named \"Four Treasures\" Rice Box was only $5.00 which  drew me in but I soon find out not all FANCY names are the best Dishes offered.

Four Treasures?

BBQ Pork, BBQ Charsui, Salt Egg and Marinaded Parts(Tongue for me  :P ).  I quickly realize my wrong choice of Dish as I see small parts of each item was not taken directly from the BBQ Display Case but from what was leftover on the Chopping Board.  Nothing looked amazingly appetizing but were A-OK and it's nice to enjoy Steam Plain Rice especially when sauced with the perfect amount.  I even found small amounts of Napa Cabbage.   2.5 *Star*

Soy Milk or House Soup?

One thing I can tell you is while I enjoyed the House Soup in the moment, it was not the best of choice with affects soon afterwards.  I haven't had the Soy Milk but I'm guessing it won't be too bad a choice in this case.  Up to you to decide.

...sometimes it's a bad feeling when you feel regret when it's too late."}
{"text":"Roasted pork (rib section) - just as good as last time. Meat was tender. Skin was crispy. Definitely better than a lot of places I've had it. If you ask them to, they'll let you choose where (within reason) you want your meat cut from. If they have a whole pig, I doubt the'd let you hack a chunk out of the top if they usually start from the bottom, but I don't actually know this for a fact.

Sweet and sour pork ($4.00) - not made to order. More like made so that if people want to buy sweet and sour pork made from that day's pork odds and ends, they're welcome to. At $4.00, I really can't complain. I've had much worse sweet and sour pork at much higher prices. I've also found that sweet and sour pork from Chinese BBQ stalls have a considerably higher meat to filler veggie ratio, probably because they don't bother to obtain veggies to put into their sweet and sour pork. This one had a few tiny scraps of onions. All in all, good portion, decent sweet and sour pork, and quite cheap.

Nice touch. I wanted the roasted pork bones. There are plenty of Chinese BBQ places that'll charge, sometimes through the nose, for these bones. I asked, and the lady manning the counter gave me a good sized pork back bone (I think it's a back bone), for free! I wish there was more (even if I had to purchase it), but she told me they were out. Oh well. Another day!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for 20yrs now and a regular to them now. Compared to most places I've been to the taste doesn't come close to how good this place tastes. Portions of lunch box are good amount. Roasted pig and the bbq pork taste awesome."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. First off they charges me tax and other customer they didn't charge tax.

The roasted pork tasted like it was boiled.
The bbq pork tasted porky and salt favour.

Very disappointed in the quality food.

I would highly recommend the bbq take out place right outside the food court

I would rate them zero stars if I could on yelp.

Rice tasted pretty bad, with the horrible sauce.
Only thing I can say good about this place, it's open late"}
{"text":"Located inside a small Chinese food court. I got some roast duck and pork to go. I thought the meat was very decent and comparable to most Chinese BBQ joints around. Even the leftovers still tasted pretty good the next day when reheated. I also got some fried tofu from here and it was silky smooth."}
{"text":"Came here regularly for the past 10 years since I like Chinese BBQ and they're the first thing I see when I enter the food court. I always get the soy sauce chicken.

The last time I came here, it was 8pm on a Sunday so they were about to close. When i asked for Soysauce chicken leg + BBQ pork, I was told that they were out of BBQ pork and that they can give me red sausages instead. I clearly saw BBQ pork but didn't say anything since I really only care about the chicken. When I got home, I noticed that they only gave me three small pieces of chicken. 

Wtf is there problem. If they didn't have enough chicken, they should have told me and i would have went elsewhere. I don't get why Chinese BBQ shops think it is okay to give their customers the short end of the stick. If you think customers deserve more respect and you don't like being ripped off, please support better service by not going here. I'm never buying food here again."}
{"text":"Was in the area and went for lunch. Saw the rice box special and the woman manning the cash kept pushing to say how good their food was.  So I gave it a try but received a roasted pork and duck (they charge  more than the advertised price) but the main issue was that the meats tasted sourish (gone bad) I brought it back and they declined to do anything. Piss poor service, this type of behavior may work back in China but this is Toronto and have filed a complaint with Toronto Board of Health to investigate their operation"}
{"text":"I too actually came here to look for HoHo BBQ after highly recommended by Tony F. and found out it is closed on Wednesday!

But there are another 2 BBQ places in the Plaza that is open.. so what the heck! Let's have some Chinese BBQ.

This is the first Chinese BBQ place I have been to for the last 2 years and I have never yelped about any of them. But I been eating a lot of BBQ pork, roasted duck and soy sauce chicken from takeout when my cook is on strike.

2 selections with soup of the day or soy milk drink ($5.00) is A-OK. So nice I was given a roasted duck thigh without asking or paying extra! Yes Chinese thinks the best part of the duck is their thighs, as we love dark meat. The skin is nice and crispy, the meat is juicy and melt in the mouth tender. The roasted pork is A-ok too, soft and juicy and have a lot of flavours....the only complaint it is a little bit too salty for my taste.

Love the Chinese veggie that goes with my lunch box to go order... at least I feel like I am eating something healthy too! Next time I will say less rice more veggie!

The lady was nice and friendly and even smile at me... Not often in other Chinese places :P

Cash Only!"}
{"text":"I came here because HoHo BBQ was closed.

The verdict?  this place only survives because Hoho bbq closes on Wednesday and closes early.

they take the left over customers who initially come for Hoho BBQ.  the roasted pork may have been one of the driest roasted pork ever.. texture was like the dry turkey breast left out for a day.  

the sauce in the rice is not that great.  I give it 2 star for food and .5 star extra because my friend felt totally sad for them.

so overall 2.5"}
