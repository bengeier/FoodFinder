{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised how good the pizza is. It really gives the other bigger pizza chains a run for their money. While it is priced higher than it's competitors I do feel you get your money's worth. I recommend you try one of their specialty pizzas, they are really really good."}
{"text":"Catering too!! Catering or sit down and dine at the restaurant...! We had Antonio's cater two graduation parties and one school staff party!  A friend liked the food so much that he had his fianc√© call me to ask for the name - and they are using it for their wedding now!!  Amazing food at 1/2 the cost than many of the great BBQ places!!  Trays of Chicken Marsala, lasagna, loaded baked potatoes, salad and more!!  We even asked Craig, the manager, if they can serve on site.  He sent two of the friendliest Broadview Height employees to our home in Hudson. Definitely check their web site for food and pricing, but call or email Craig (contact info on web site) if you want to customize it to your event.  I throw a lot of parties and this place is a little known gem in the area!!"}
{"text":"I was looking for takeout pizza better than one of the bigger chains (P Hut, Domino's, Papa John's) but was pretty disappointed overall with Antonio's.   I got a large specialty pizza and a pound of hot wings for $30. Could've gotten the same quality at any one of the aforementioned chains at half the price.  The Pizza: 3 stars The Dolce Picante (Sweet & Spicy) \"Our sweet sicilian sauce topped with our special blend of provolone cheese, old world pepperoni, spicy italian sausage, finished with a garlic romano crust.\"  I had pretty high hopes for this pie after reading the description. I would recommend ordering well-done/thin crust because it was too rubbery and doughy for me. The toppings were decent, most notably the spicy Italian sausage. But again, you'll get similar quality at a big chain.  The Wings: 0 stars I don't expect a pizzeria to always have bomb wings, but if it's on the menu I expect them to be an OK compliment to the pizza. These were honestly worse than store-bought wings. They tasted like they had been microwaved and then just drenched in a liquid-like hot sauce. You have an oven - use it. I want at least some crisp to my wings, but these, like the pizza were severely undercooked. I'm also not sure why they use pounds as the metric rather than actual number of wings. This \"pound\" was 10 wings, so at almost a dollar/wing I'm expecting so much more than the trash they're passing off as wings. Ranch/bleu cheese is not included ($0.35).  Overall: 2 stars Below average quality at an outrageous price point. I won't say I'll never order from here again, because I may be intoxicated enough one weekend to forget how disappointing this was.  Step up your game, Antonio's."}
{"text":"My second attempt at getting pizza at this location has resulted in the WRONG pizza again! Fortunately this time I hadn't left the shop yet, but a few weeks ago I was already home when I discovered their error! They are apologetic and willing to offer a gift card for the errors, but I hope (if) I go there again they might get my order right! I will then update my review as they usually do have good pizza!!! Their Chicago-style deep dish supreme is very good, but the pepperoni-black olives-onion that I received in error (ordered a supreme) was mediocre."}
{"text":"Good pizza, but my rating was lowered because I got a bad meatball sub today.  Two of the meatballs were burned as though they had been microwaved for a long time.  Pizza alone would have been a four star rating."}
{"text":"I have only had pizza delivered so let me start by saying that.  I hope their food is better than their pizza because that was terrible.  I am from the NY area to be fair and I have yet to find a place with decent pizza in Ohio.  I would go with Papa John over this place."}
{"text":"Who is writing these awful ratings for Antonio's? Their pizza is delic and the only brand will we eat now. Ingredients are really fresh, dough is nice consistency and just a touch of yeast flavor, and cheese is high quality. There sauce is OK, but we usually order Alfredo or Garlic/Oil because it is better. All in all you can't get a better pizza. They have a One Special / One One-Topping for $20.99 which is a very good deal. Perfect for New Year's Eve :)"}
{"text":"I see all the new commercials but if you think this is real Italian pizza you are mistaken. This pizza is tasteless and those big chunks of sausage and greasy is not true Italian. I grew up with real pizza, not to mention the front counter staff was a bit arrogant,"}
{"text":"Told me that they would not deliver me my order since it was snowing out. I then look at my window to see a delivery car dropping off food to some of my neighbors. My order for 4 people was well over 50 bucks but now I will never spend there again. I will chalk them up to another food chain that used it's name as a crutch. Really upset over the customers service especially since they kept delivering to several of my neighbors after my call. Completely unprofessional if they don't want to deliver pizza get a different job"}
{"text":"Restaurant is new to the area, figured that new restaurant pride would shine. Unfortunately, food (steak subs and meatball sub) failed. I could have made much better. Bread on all were stale, sandwiches were not seasoned, meat was overcooked and gray."}
{"text":"Delicious lunch special - one large slice with great salad and house dressing. Pizza is good, love the crust, place loss a lot nicer and cleaner than most to-go pizza places around here."}
{"text":"Save your money and DO NOT order wings. They are overpriced and not like any wing you would expect.  These are like they cooked them in a crock pot, and put them in a pan an poured butter on them.  A good wing is deep fried and crispy.  They should remove wings from their menu.  This was unexpected as their broasted chicken is quite good."}
{"text":"Man the pizza is excellent! Very well packaged!!! Not to greasy!!!! Just right! The only thing I will say is that it's a bit pricy but very worth it!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that the hubby considers himself a pizza connoisseur. Antonio's pizza is the only other pizzeria he will eat compared to his beloved Angelo's in Lakewood, Ohio. We usually go to the Antonio's pizzeria in Solon, but he is so happy they opened one up in Macedonia. Sometimes, when local restaurants try to expand and grow their brand the  quality of food goes down, but not Antonio's the food quality is still great. Customer service is always excellent."}
{"text":"I liked the pizza I got.  Ordered a medium pepperoni pizza and hot boneless wings.  I ate the wings first.  Exactly what you would expect, nothing special at all.  Normal value there.  The pizza was pretty good too.  I LOVE the crust.  The sauce was nice.  Pepperoni was normal in amount and size and flavor.  Too much cheese for my liking.  On the menu I think I remember there being a choice for how much cheese, I got normal, should have picked light.  If you're a cheese person, you'd most likely really like what I got."}
{"text":"Food good,46 minutes to deliver 4 miles away much to long (216) 415-7527.lsome stories can be told in only 6 fee words"}
{"text":"I do not understand all the bad reviews! Perhaps angry pizza shop owners in the area who are jealous of this place... I've ate here now twice and both times have been perfect. Food came fast and hot. Pizza very delicious. Perfect amount of sauce and toppings. I love the salads and the dressing is great. The jojos are awesome! Please folks try Antonios! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Tasty pizza, but very, VERY greasy! My favorite thing we got was the Italian nuggets. If you're looking for fresh Italian pizza, this is not your place! I was expecting this to be similar to NY style pizza or anything that is advertised as \"Real Italian Pizza\". The sauce was tasty & different, but the overall pizza was nothing close to being authentic."}
{"text":"Our whole family prefers Antonios to any other pizza. We have been going there for well over 30 years. This one seems to be as good as we expect and order regularly."}
{"text":"3/31/18 This is the second time I've tried one of their Sicilian pizzas. They are literally the best pizzas I've found that can be delivered to my house. The California Sicilian Supreme is my favorite, but the Portobello Palermo is also over the top delicious. They are very thick, have a buttery crust and are loaded with flavor."}
{"text":"What is with all the negative Nelly reviews? This place is awesome! I would never want to give a nationwide chain my money again after eating this place. From when I call in my order, picking it up, to then actually eating the food I have absolutely no complaints. The crust has a great crunch, the toppings are very generous, and just all around great. Hubby usually only likes pepperoni pizza but has since tried other types of pizza they offer ... It's just that great!"}
{"text":"Looks better than it tastes. Very doughy pizza - needs to be thinner & better cooked. Second time we ordered (hoping it'd be better) - no more"}
{"text":"Another disgraceful restaurant/pizza chain. The pizza is pathetic. Worst part of the pizza is the sauce. Come on people, know what good pizza is. Two thumbs way down."}
{"text":"If you want rubbery buffalo wings this is your place. If you like them crispy and well done find another restaurant. It doesn't matter how you place your order. You can ask for extra extra crispy you can ask for well done. They can confirm and repeat it back to you however when you get the wings it's painfully obvious they really don't care how they cook them. Never mind the person that hands them to you checking to see if the order was cooked properly that's nonexistent too. Shame on you Antonio's."}
{"text":"Online ordering works pretty well once you figure it out. Nowhere to use your gift card online, though. I had to take mine to the location to redeem. Good pizza better than dominos Pizza Hut papa johns etc."}
{"text":"All of the awful reviews are very warranted. I placed an online order for pickup. While waiting in the store for my order, they sold the order I had placed to someone else. Terrible service, I will not be returning. Would rate less than 1 if I could."}
