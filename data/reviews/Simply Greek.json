{"text":"Been here about 6 or 7 times and finally met the owner Pete. Great guy! We are proud to support this local business. The service has always been friendly, fast, and accommodating. The food is EXCELLENT and priced in my opinion lower than expected. As other posts have mentioned, a sign board is displayed infront of the restraunt. It is updated to reflect current political/religious events. We look forward to the opinions being posted by the employees. This is a business who chooses to take great pride in their products, service, and patriotism. Simply Greek...simply amazing."}
{"text":"Had their standard gyro which was BIG, so much meat on there it could have easily been split into 2-3 individual gyros so they def do not skimp on portions & you get your money's worth. Tasted great, no complaints."}
{"text":"I stopped by this restaurant while in town for a concert. The staff was friendly and provided samples, since they picked up that I was unfamiliar with their style of food. In short, everything was excellent!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that I have always enjoyed the food that I have bought at Simply Greek. I have tried several sandwiches and gyros, wings, and love their baklava and rice pudding! I've never not had something tasty here. The employees have always been very friendly and gracious, and I have even received free samples of foods there from time to time, which was awesome.

I do however have some issue with the response of the owner (Nick M.) to some of the reviews left here on Yelp, as well as his use of political/moral signage that is always out on the street front. I understand that it is his business and therefore he can post what he wishes on the sign, but sometimes it is at the expense of sounding offensive or overly political for what this place is...a family gyro joint. I have been put off by the signs several times myself, but the recent reactions of the owner to Kay K. (see the reviews below) are absolutely ridiculous, and it angered me and also made me sad. Not only did you call out a member of the community with incisive words and a very uncouth response, but you also admitted to making fun of the transgender community, or those who self-identify. Very uncool on all counts.

Simply Greek, I enjoy your food a lot, and my family and friends eat there frequently. I am not trying to throw you completely under the bus, as I think this is a tasty and worht-it establishment. But perhaps reconsider the message you are sending out into the community, and how a couple of chuckles at your signage may be at the expense of people's feelings and also at the expense of potential customers. I am very displeased with your response to customers' legitimate opinions and concerns, and that plus the bigotry of your signage makes me question continuing to support your business.

Keep in mind, your food isn't all that matters in regards to people's decision to eat at your restaurant."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly staff. Gyros are huge and the baklava is heavenly. My favorite menu item is the chicken souvlaki; it's tender and flavorful."}
{"text":"Great food! Great customer service! The portion sizes were large. The staff was very friendly. 2 workers  asked us how everything was and if we needed anything else. The food was well seasoned and very fresh as well. Highly highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Great service and good food. We love going there or doing take out using their drive through window. We definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Great food, even better hospitality! Felt like I was a guest at a friends house! My wife and I got the Souvlaki, delicious!"}
{"text":"Amazing. I got a Titan giro, chicken wings, lamb soup, and two kids burgers. Everything was the best of its kind!  Highly recommended this restaurant!"}
{"text":"So happy this place opened - Uptown needed something like this! Their food is so FRESH but also fast. My friend and I were both very happy with our lamb gyros and their tzatziki sauce is awesome. They also had delicious baklava samples at the register which were super yummy and everyone who works there is very friendly :)"}
{"text":"Love the food and owners! Def a small hometown type of place. They have a dessert that is banana's foster-esque, it's the best dessert I've had  Pete is the man!"}
{"text":"I have only eaten here once, but it was incredible. Their gyro meat is insanely good, and their fries are delicious. It was on the verge of being too salty for me, but I hardly like salty foods, so take that as you will. Also, their staff was extremely nice! 

Tip: Order to go. The restaurant itself is very tiny and crowded."}
{"text":"Amazing place with amazing service. Everyone is incredibly friendly and helpful. The food is insanely good. Gyros are generously sized and packed with flavor. Not to mention the in-house made tzatziki! The saganaki is very delicious as well. This place is quickly becoming a goto for me. 

PS they are open until 10 which is amazing for this area. No where else to grab a drunk bite!"}
{"text":"The guys here work magic. Makes no sense how so much meat can be packed into one pita. Perfectly seasoned, great prices, and positive vibes. Get the Titan if you want to eat for three days.

Solid onion rings too."}
{"text":"I visited yesterday with my friend that is visiting from out of town. We were killing time after going to the art museum and the botanical gardens nearby. It was a short walk from that area and the food was DELICIOUS. The customer service was even better. We had the menu explained to us twice; first by one of the workers while we were looking at it outside deciding if we wanted to go in (they have it taped to the window) and then again by the possible owner taking our order when we couldn't decide what to get. Everyone was extremely nice and the owner was full of jokes. As we were getting ready to leave, after wrapping up our meal with some scrumptious baklava (I bought extra to take home), they brought over a sample of rice pudding for us to try. Keeping in theme with the overall visit, that was also good. I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic! This is a great gyro joint and the quality is excellent. Everything is fresh and made to order and the staff is friendly. They've recently opened and are getting more efficient. The owner is extremely helpful an friendly. Having just moved here I was craving gyro and saganaki and this place stacks up well against any Chicago Greektown gyro joint. Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by after a museum visit and was NOT disappointed. We had grape leaves, spinach and feta phyllo, gyro and chicken wings. Everything was great. Truly. The owner/chef stopped at our table and told us all about the recipes. Great food great service. Will be returning. (Got the baklava to go.)"}
{"text":"Went in again.  Food is still good but the guy behind the counter seemed angry.  Something about the landlord.  Place has a weird negative vibe.  The political signs outside are off-putting.  Not sure why you would alienate people when you are a business owner."}
{"text":"The Gyros are delicious!!! Super fresh and flavorful.  The tzatziki sauce was fabulous!!  I cannot wait to come back and try something new!!!"}
{"text":"Do NOT order mussel!!! It's not fresh, and I don't think it's fully cooked. It made me sick."}
{"text":"So much potential here! 

Food is great. 10 out of 10. Atmosphere...well need some work here. Please remember this is Chagrin Falls. If someone needs to wait for 15 minutes for their food to be prepared. You need to have a more enticing environment. It's basically a white tile floor with some tables scattered throughout. It just screams carry out place, and I don't think that is what the ownership is trying to accomplish. 

And please start taking credit cards.....never understand...they are losing so much business because they don't take credit cards. 

Seems as though the ownership has some good recipes, and they prepare them well, but I am guessing this is their first go at a restaurant, I may be wrong....but you have so much potential...being in a populated well to do community the opportunity to make some serious cash is there if they spent a little more effort for the interior to match their great food."}
{"text":"Simply delicious!  Everything was so flavorful. It makes such a difference when care is given to cook from scratch with great ingredients rather than the \"grown for transport but little flavor\" ones some restaurants use. They do a lot of takeout and there are also seat yourself tables. No waitstaff but the very friendly owner checks on you if they aren't too busy. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We found this restaurant on Yelp and decided to give it a try. My wife likes Greek food far more than I do; however if more Greek restaurants were like this, I would be a frequent customer. Wow, the gyro and burgers were Amazing! My kid's chicken fingers were delicious; they were marinated and breaded in-house and you could taste it. The owner and his family were unbelievably friendly and you can tell the pride they have and put into their food. I will go out of my way to eat here again!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  High quality gyro sandwich, amazing baklava and rice pudding, quality draft beer and homemade pita chips.  The owner is unbelievably hospitable and friendly.  What a great spot!!!"}
{"text":"Easily the best food in Bainbridge. We go in often. The food is always fresh and consistent. 

Try the Calamari*"}
{"text":"This place was fantastic.  It's very low key - order at counter and wait for your food.  The farther and son owners were so friendly that I felt like a regular.  I tried three samples of beer before I found the one I liked; it happened to be the owners favorite.  My gyro and grape leaves were phenomenal!  I'm picky as we have great Greek food where I grew up, Chicago.

This place is worth finding!!!"}
{"text":"Best burger I have ever had- strange to say it was from a Greek restaurant haha. So juicy and absolutely delicious. The original gyro was very good, the meat was flavorful and the sauce was delicious. The baklava hit the spot for sure. Definitely going again for that burger!"}
{"text":"What a great experience!  The owner is awesome, only matched by the food. My son and I both had gyros. Maybe the best we have ever had. Not just a lot of meat (and man...there was a lot of meat!) but the quality was superb. He brought us a couple of free samples, one being barbecue wings!  They were deep fried, with delicious sauce and very meaty.  This place is definitely a place you have to try!"}
{"text":"Owner is generous and likes to share a sample of his families recipes. Food is pretty good, portion sizes are perfect but best taken to go. Baclava is excellent and the Greek Olive oil is high quality. Definitely worth a try. I will go back."}
{"text":"I've grown up eating Greek food and this place has the best stuff I've ever had. Everything is fresh and delicious and overall perfect. By far the best Greek place in Cleveland. The people who work there are passionate about their food and it shows. Overall a wonderful experience - every time."}
{"text":"Did an awesome job catering a family get together. Everyone raved about the food. Thank you Pete and staff for a fantastic meal -  great food - great service!
Will definitely use you again and recommend you to family and friends."}
{"text":"I love their Gyros+fries and their rice pudding! The standard gyros are HUGE, and they're very generous with their meat. I've also had their burger twice--yummy but not as good as the gyros. 
The employees are always super friendly and I love it that it's so close to the campus and apartments. The food usually comes out pretty quickly and there are plenty of seats inside and outside."}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service. We had a traditional gyro (best ever) and shrimp platter that was served with fries and salad, awesome. The place was packed, I'm sure because it's quick service and delicious. The owner/manager even checked on us :) Very nice that you can have an adult beverage as well!"}
{"text":"Delicious, authentic Greek food like Yia Yia makes. Everyone was friendly, especially Pete, the owner. A casual gem. Amazing Baklava, but everything was delicious. Go hungry!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, both with quality and quantity!! Very gracious hosts and owners.  Had the gyros, the Trojan fries with bacon, and Mythos beer. Everything was fantastic and we were all very pleased. Parking was easy and it's located in a super cute neighborhood. We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Cool indie place for comfort food (gyros, fries, burgers) in a solid neighborhood. You order at the counter and they bring it to your table. Employees are friendly and efficient. Decent selection of beers (bottle and draft). Not a lot of seating, and it's somewhat pricey. Plenty of nearby free parking."}
{"text":"As a new arrival to Cleveland I was looking for a lunch place close to work that served quick, delicious food.  Look no more, Simply Greek does it in spades, with a super-friendly staff as well. I've had both the classic gyro and Greek salad -- super-filling and wonderfully prepared.  Have been back three times in a month.  This is my new go-to work lunch place."}
{"text":"I was dying for a gyro last night I decided  go over there the Greek place here and I got gyro  which was very good but to me I don't like a lettuce otherwise it's a nice big sandwich it's worth every penny and it was very tasty and good"}
{"text":"Just stopped by on the advice of a friend. Ordered the Titan gyro, Spanakopita, and freshly cut fries. The BEST gyro I've had. Spanakopita and fries rocked as well. The jackass from Arizona's review didn't even merit a reply. The owner could not have been more gracious and professional. Agree with Chagrin Falls reviewer about the credit card acceptance as I mentioned this to the owner. I had planned on charging my order and luckily carry an emergency $20 bill in my wallet.  A small business such as this operates on slim margins but not accepting credit cards in this day and age is not wise. The prices are reasonable enough that I suggest a slight increase to cover the cost of credit card transactions. Not being able to charge is a definite turnoff for many potential customers. I think the owner will realize this in time and do what he has to do in order to make it happen. I will definitely return. (Providing I have the emergency $20 in my wallet)"}
{"text":"The regular gyros here do a decent job of satisfying your craving for Greek food, especially if you get them during happy hour (4-6:30pm) for $5! The baklava was a bit sweeter than I liked but still had the overall flavor. Take a look around the space - the signs are hilariously enjoyable."}
{"text":"I work in the uptown area and decided to check out Simply Greek for lunch because I've heard great things.

We ordered the Chicken Souvlaki, which was absolutely spectacular. It was served on pita that tasted like it was made minutes before. We asked if they make their own pita, and although they don't, they buy it all locally and it was top of the line. They piled on the meat- very generous with the chicken. All of the veggies were fresh and the awesome tzaziki just topped it all off!

This place is great and I'll definitely be coming back frequently. It's easy to stop by and grab a quick bite, but would also be very convenient to take to go as well! If you want a quick, fresh and healthy lunch in University Circle- this is the place!!"}
{"text":"A little out of the way but the gyro is worth the trip.  Easily one of the two best gyro places I have been to in Ohio (Steve's at West Side Market is the other).  The Tzatziki sauce actually had some flavor to it, unlike most places.  Portion size was very generous, prices reasonable, and staff friendly and attentive.  Stopped in for lunch today and had to wait maybe 2 minutes in line to order my gyro then sat down.  No more than 2 minutes later out comes the owner with my lunch.  I ordered mine slightly different than the way the menu lists, but it was made exactly the way I ordered it, thank you.  The taste was wonderful.  When I was about half way through with my gyro, the owner came back out and made sure I was happy with my lunch.  Needless to say, I will definitely be back even though it is a 15 minute drive each way from work, it is worth it."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. but it disappointed. We expect good value and reliably good food at Greek places around Chicagoland, but I guess Cleveland isn't so picky. It is very hard to find, and parking is expensive, The wait was long and the food disappointing. I ordered the smelt special, thinking smelt should be cheap and plentiful and should be well prepared at a Greek place but it was expensive, and only had about 6 small. greasy, overbrowned but ironically, uncrispy little guppies. It wasn't even enough as an appetizer, and I can't think how they could have screwed up the preparation without trying, I have prepared them at least 20 times and they are the easiest thing to prepare perfectly every time. The rest of the food (wraps) was okay but definitely underwhelming. The kicker for me was that using a credit card was performed on an IPOD that automatically defaulted to a 15 or 20% tip, which is ridiculous at a counter service dive with no service, and attempting to change the default was difficult.  The concept of paying a tip BEFORE you find out how bad the food tastes and for no real service is ludicrous."}
{"text":"Was looking for something different from the Norm and found it here. Great lamb chop dinner...best ever and baklava to die for!! The staff and atmosphere were awesome also.  And still family owned!!  for sure!!"}
{"text":"Food was great! I just didn't feel like I was actually in Greece which is what I was looking for.."}
{"text":"Gyros and Chicken Souvlaki are large, filled with fresh ingredients and delicious.  French Fries are hand cut, crispy and adding bacon and melted cheddar puts them over the top yummy.  They are totally worth the extra 30 mins I will spend in the gym working them off.     The Greek Wrap with four tortilla choices of Plain Flour, Sundried Tomato Basil, Spinach Pesto and Garlic & Herb is one of my favorites as well.  The Black Angus Burger is also extremely tasty since it is juicy, well-seasoned and cooked to order.  Creative menu filled with Opa-tizers, Salads, Soup, Wraps, Pitas, Wings, Burgers, Grilled Chicken, Seafood and other entrees.  Homemade desserts too!  The staff have ALWAYS been courteous, efficient and accommodating."}
{"text":"Business travel is not easy these days yet the best thing is finding Great Local Restaurants!, Yelp helped again by finding Simply Greek. Wonderful people, really tasty food and well worth the reroute thru Cleveland to eat. All our food was incredibly fresh and really flavorful. I will be happy to make the detour off I-80 to stop so why don't you'all?
Continued Success in your business Simply Greek!"}
{"text":"Great food! Great prices! My favorite Greek restaurant in the Cleveland area. Love the Saganaki. Everything excellent including the service."}
{"text":"Came in town for a wedding and needed a prewedding meal lol so looked up places around that were local and this place came up. Beyond pleased w/the decision!!! I ordered the classic w/ fries and onion rings and OH they have a full bar so I got a titos and tonic. The owner makes the food himself and is very funny. Personable and comes out when he isn't making things to check on customers. They aren't shy with portions so you may take it home, actually you will! Hands down the best gyro ever and the fries don't even need ketchup, geez...can't really think of anymore compliments bc I'm rushing back via walk to my room to get ready but I look forward to my post wedding meal for sure! Thanks Simply Greek!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! Since I first tried the restaurant a few months ago, Simply Greek has become an essential part of my weekly routine. I stop in for the Classic Gyro (and Baklava samples) at least once a week. Not only is the food delicious, fresh, and specially made, but the owners and chef are some of the warmest people I have met since moving to Cleveland. Great food, great energy, great restaurant!"}
{"text":"I have had an aversion for gyros for a while, but after eating a gyro at simply, I'm back at it again. I got their regular gyro and it's it BIG. It comes neatly rolled in a tin cone; don't unwrap it completely! It's there to help keep the structural integrity of the overflowing gyro. I made the mistake of unwrapping it and the equivalent of the contents for three regular gyros immediately started spilling out. The quality of the food matches the quantity, surpassing what I expected. Im sitting here waiting to digest some more because I want to eat more of this awesome gyro. 

The place itself is also neat; lots of Cleveland memorabilia placed around the walls, and the staff is great. Would recommend 10/10"}
{"text":"My first visit here. Wonderful place near university hospitals. Free parking available across the street. Delicious gyros, amazing rice cake pudding and a very friendly owner. There is the option to sit outside and eat as well which is an additional bonus."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times, and what keeps me coming back is the quality, cleanliness, and consistency. I've watched enough Kitchen Nightmares to know a good restaurant from a bad one, and this one is really good! It's a small casual restaurant with great, fresh food and a good beer selection. My Greek friend gave the food the stamp of approval. It's family owned, which is a plus, and you can see the owner and his son working behind the counter. They're very friendly and when they have time, like to interact with customers. The wait time can be a while, but I don't mind waiting for good food to be cooked right. Sometimes I'll call ahead and order take out.

The portions are always large and consistent. If it's your first time, you can't go wrong with the classic gyro. It's packed with meat, to the point that I feel that the meat to toppings ratio is off. Souvlaki is good but is a little salty if you eat the meat by itself. Souvlaki platter is large but is a little salty from the chicken, feta, olives, and fries. Fries are great and love the twist in seasoning. Spartan is like a very large sandwich and had to share it with someone else. If you like fish and chips, get the fish dinner. Large, crispy fish with fries and tartar sauce. Burger is great but greasy. Salads are fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"Gyros taste good, fries are nothing special. I'm okay with the price of gyros but the salads are way over priced $9 for what looks like a 6\"x6\" side salad? My friend ordered the salad for dinner and it looks just like a side salad, disappointing. Total order was $17, for a Classic Gyro and 6\"x6\"

update: thank you for responding Nick M., ill chalk it up as an honest mistake. Great to have your restaurant in the area."}
{"text":"One of the best places you find, hands down. Diamond-in-the-rough restaurant and once you will go there you be in love. Huge servings in the gyros and amazing, fresh ingredients. Extremely good food. But what sets this restaurant aside is the ownership. The man who runs the restaurant is the ideal small-business entrepreneur and exemplifies how every owner should treat its customers. He has treated myself and other guests to free samples (delicious) and ensures each customers satisfaction. Ideal American small business."}
{"text":"Wow. Girl friend and I just tried this. Really high quality. Best gyro I ever had outside Greece. Not kidding. GF had ahead salad with shrimp and rice - amazing. 

Update: April 2017. Tried chicken gyro - equally amazing!"}
{"text":"Edit: after seeing the restaurant's response, I've bumped my rating to 5 stars.  Ultimately, this is a systems issue and they dealt with it appropriately.  Glad that they are willing to take advice.  Bring on the gyros! 
____

I'm a bit torn to be honest. Last week I ordered a large catering order for 25 people and the lady who took the order and I spoke with multiple times. I ordered a gyro platter with some chicken on the side as well as a large Greek salad and two orders of dolmas. Never once did she ask me whether or not I needed cups or plates with the order (which came with four 2 liter bottles of soda). 

Later on when the order was delivered to my apartment, I didn't bother to check with any plates or spoons or flatware but I assumed it would be with such a large order. When I got upstairs, there were no plates forks or spoons and napkins for that matter. I called to complain and the person who answered the phone and claimed that they went over the order twice with me and said that plates usually cost extra. He apologized for forgetting to include one of the two liter bottles of Diet Coke and said that if you want we can come by and drop off some plates and spoons and cups but we already hungry cause they were late for the delivery and were finding other ways to hold our food. I appreciate the apology but if they charge extra for the plates, at least tell you or warn you and ask you if you want them or not.  

That being said the food was tasty gyro meat was delicious. French fries were cooked well and the dolmata were very good. I would go to this restaurant person but I don't know if I will be ordering catering from them anymore."}
{"text":"I love this place! The owner is super friendly, and the service is good! Food is filling and really delicious, I got the chicken falafel (there is a more official name, but it's the item exactly in the middle of the menu Haha) and got self-pressured into getting a piece of the baklava. 

The owner told me the falafel uses the freshest ingredients and a yogurt sauce. Really you should try this place to get an idea of what I mean! Prices are super reasonable too!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The staff are so friendly, always offering free samples, and always making great suggestions about their menu. The meat is flavorful, hot, fresh. Their specials are always delicious especially their watermelon and feta cheese dish. A few days ago I tried the hamburger for the first time and it was on point. We go there frequently for work, and it's hard to say no to their sides / desserts - the sweet mouthwatering baklava and their lemon chicken soup that can cure any winter cold. I generally always find myself in some sort of debilitating food coma, afterwards, but the current owners have totally revitalized this place and I just can't get enough. Strongly recommend!"}
{"text":"Delicious. We were hankering for some Greek food after attending parade at the circle. This was so awesome and made me happy we waited.

It's like a traditional Greek place with a twist (dill in the tzatziki and herbs in the pita) and really fresh ingredients. The salad dressing is also clearly homemade and delicious. The owner was quirky and teased a lot of the patrons. 

Deeeeelish. Opa!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!  The food is so good for the price - a gyro is super filling and cheaper than anything nearby.  The staff is amazing and the owner is really nice.  Also, I'm pretty sure it's the only independent restaurant around.  They have great food and great beers.  What else do you want?"}
{"text":"For a moment I was transported to Greece as the flavors of their gyros danced all over my mouth.  So tasty!  The spices were just right with a great balance between them.  The side of fries were also just right.  Upon arriving they provided a sample of their baklava which as also perfectly balanced.  A must stop when in town.  No need to check out the nearby eateries as this is the spot.  A further bonus is that they have both Coke and Pepsi products!"}
{"text":"AMAZING!!! Huge portions and great prices. Feta cheese was as fresh as it gets. I could happily eat here every day."}
{"text":"I usually do not write reviews, but this place deserves one. The BEST Greek food you will ever find. The flavors are bang on! The food is always cooked fresh in front of you. The food is simple , clean and healthy with nothing artificial added in there. The people are the sweetest and always greet you with a smile. You will leave wanting for more and more. This place makes my stomach happy. A MUST try"}
{"text":"Spent the entire day in Cleveland with my wife and Simply Greek was a highlight. For lunch we had Greek Salad with Salmon and the house gyro. Great ingredients and the salmon wasn't frozen. Gyro meat was fantastic. But above all the owner Pete was incredibly welcoming to us out of towners. He enthusiastically shared the sites and sounds to look out for as well as other notable eateries. Stop in soon. You will not regret."}
{"text":"Simply Greek is by far the greatest Greek restaurant I have ever been to. It's a smidge confusing to locate, but that is completel irrelivant.

Upon entering the super sweet lady behind the counter doles out Baklava samples refusing no for an answer lol And it was AMAZING! Flaky, Succulant, Rich & just YUM!

I odered the Gyro & Hand Cut fries. It was quite enough for 2 people. The portion size for a $9.00 Gyro was colossal. I was almost afraid to eat it because surely that size for that price I was expecting the lamb to be dry & the produce to be tasteless. I have never been so pleased to be wrong in my liiiiife. The meat was expertly cut & seasoned, juicy, tender and just plain the absolute best. The red onions & spinach were fresh & flavorful. The pita was soft & full of flavor. Fries were fried perfectly & the seasoning was superb!

While we were eating, the nice Baklava lady brought us complimentary rice pudding which was delicious!

The staff all seemed to have super personalities and were very accomodating. They truly made us feel as though we were part of a big Greek Family Get together. Laughing, joking & visiting with all of their customers. 

Will most definately be back next trip through Cleveland!"}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Cleveland. The service is great and the food is AMAZING. Real authentic and savory. All food is fresh and taste as if you were actually in Greece."}
{"text":"Love this place, it's clean, has a nice atmosphere, has good prices on beer and mixed drinks, and most
Importantly has great food! I usually the get the regular gyro and that's more than enough for me, and for the price I feel like I'm getting something a step above the chains surrounding Simply Greek like chipotle, Panera, or jimmy johns. Would recommend to a friend any day."}
{"text":"Awesome gyro, too big to finish. Baklava samples and yogurt was delicious. The staff was friendly and prompt. This place will do great, you should stop by!"}
{"text":"Come with an empty stomach because there is a lot of food in one simple plate. I've been to Greece before and was definitely looking to get some tzaziki and souvlaki again. When I was in Greece, I always thought that all the dishes had so much meat in it and it is the same withe Simply Greek. Good food, but lots. I ordered the Souvlaki Platter and could barely finish it . There's a location near Case Western, but it seems like they have other locations (Solon) in Cleveland as well."}
{"text":"Gyro are big (the TITAN is huge), juicy, hot and tasty.  Rings and fries are excellent.  Service is friendly and helpful.  A little slow, but well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Girlfriend bought trojan fries for a potluck and they were amazing. Went back for lunch and got a gyro, smelt, and a salad. Food was super fresh and portion sizes were unbelievable. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Simply Wonderful! Simply Fresh!

In an area saturated with quick serve options, Simply Greek stands above the rest. Fresh ingredients, wonderful and quick service with a smile and an overall enjoyable experience. I've had a variety of things from the menu, but the classic Greek salad with chicken is my favorite. Ages old recipe, a plate full of fresh and vibrant vegetables, quality feta and perfectly spiced chicken hits the spot every time. 

Noteworthy also is a rather extensive beer selection. They also do a happy hour and have a patio for those summer late afternoons.

Lastly, they are awesome at take-out. Call ahead and your order will be waiting for you - accurately.

The epitome of quality."}
{"text":"Great staff. Amazing baklava (and everything else). Free food occasionally. Best greek food around."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!! Great food at great prices. Free samples and the owner was awesome. Will definitely be back for more food and good times. You can actually taste the freshness and the rice and sauces are all homemade. Deeelicious!!!!"}
{"text":"This is the best Greek food ever! Better than I've had in Greece! You must experience Simply Greek!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Wonderful people. Wide ranging menu with good selections. The salads are all great and the gyro and souvlaki are definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Driving by this place I would never go in because of the negative, political sign outside.  It's ridiculous to possibly offend potential customers and alienating anyone when you have a business.  The owner just doesn't seem like a very nice guy and I won't support him."}
{"text":"Basically a fast food Greek food joint that also serve burgers. Food was fresh and delicious. We had the saganaki, Spartan and the lamb leg. Big portions."}
{"text":"We're enjoying this little place. Friendly people, good food and it's nice to have a Greek option in the \"quick food\" sector. We've tried most of the sandwiches and will sample the larger entrees next. Excellent Baklava! The \"real\" Greek yogurt is dense and rich. Remember the honey!

Give Simply Greek a try. You'll simply enjoy it!"}
{"text":"Best gyro I've ever had.  Was greeted by a friendly man (assuming the owner) handing out rice pudding samples.  Took 3-4 minutes to get our food.  Fairly priced.  Will be back! Very impressed.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"One of the wave of new restaurants around Uptown, Simply Greek has already established itself as a staple in many of my classmates' hearts. Mostly female classmates, due to a certain blue-eyed cashier. But enough about eye candy, let's talk food, shall we?

The most popular item is the Classic Gyro, which they make fresh and load up with a mixture of chewy lamb and beef. By load, I mean LOAD. They certainly don't skimp on the meat! The Titan is the Classic's bigger, swoll-er cousin which I'm not sure I'd be able to finish in one sitting. The meat was good (I'm still inclined to say that Steve's is better), the vegetables fresh, and tzatziki very rich. It's hard to get a mouthful with an even distribution of all the ingredients, but I guess if you deconstructed it and took a fork to the mess, you'd be able to. I wish the pita was a bit larger to encompass the whole thing, but I can't find much fault taste-wise! 

My order of Onion Rings came out piping hot on a plate, and there are ketchup and malt vinegar bottles scattered around on the tables for your dipping pleasure. I don't know if these are house-made or not but they were big, crunchy, and satisfying. Had to phone a friend to help finish. 

Other people ordered burgers that I eagerly would have taken a bite out of had I actually been acquainted with said people, but there will be a next time for that. Simply Greek also sells a small collection of various Mediterranean preserves, like house-made tzatziki, Greek yogurt, and baklava. I'm not sure if this is a normal thing or just during their promotional period, but we got to try samples of the baklava which was quite good. 

A single bathroom stall is located next to the trash cans, and it was kept up to standards. The only thing I don't really understand is, why is the paper towel dispenser at hip level? 

There's lots of TV screens around the room so that you can enjoy some form of distraction while there, though not necessarily the same as a friend who may be facing a different screen and different channel. I really like that they have high tables available as well since I have a tendency to perch half-on, half-off my chairs. Window seats available for people-watching."}
{"text":"Such a fabulous addition to University Circle--quaint & clean with friendly service. The gyros are super delicious and do not taste over saturated in salt like others I have had in the past. I ate everything without the pita and it was still just as tasty as can be, The tzatziki sauce is on point and I plan to try more on the menu. The lamb looked phenomenal!! Definitely going back."}
{"text":"Simply Greek aka Simply Great (creative???!!)- these people really know what they're doing and its apparent they make every effort to make sure you are satisfied and WILL come back. That's good business and that's why Simply Greek is here to stay. 

I've tried multiple things on the menu from the gyro, the pork, souvlaki, the list goes on... And every single time I gamble with something new I am beyond satisfied. 

Not to mention, these guys aren't oblivious to know Greek food isn't exactly the typical persons common food, so they make every effort to expose you to their offerings.

You like free samples? This place is your spot. They also do a great job with recommendations and advice. 

Don't be scared to step out of your comfort zone and try something new. Plus, you're helping a small, local business!"}
{"text":"I was actually  having a great day and a slight charge on some very average sauce would not ruin that nor make me say anything  that wasn't true. The food was nothing special, service  was rude ( as people can now read by the owner's bitter  tone)  and there are much more authentic greek places and better quality (even basic) gyros around. Simply  IS an appropriate  name though..."}
{"text":"Big portions, tasty menu, friendly service.  Even if you don't normally eat Greek food, I strongly encourage you to try this place. I love it!"}
{"text":"This food is delicious and its authentic. The owner sticks by his word and makes sure his customers are satisfied. This is one of the only Greek places that has authentic tzatziki sauce. I eat here at least 3 times a week. This place is a hidden gem I'm the university circle Uptown district. If eating in this area be sure to shop by this place. P.S the chicken wings are to die for literally. Im a life time customer."}
{"text":"Definitely some of the best Greek food in Cleveland. My go to is the classic gyro with a Greek Salad. The owner is very personable and it seems they pride themselves on quality ingredients. Definitely worthy a try for quality Greek food."}
{"text":"So I've been hearing their radio spots on 92.3 The Fan for the longest time... with their slogan of \"so fresh, they don't even own a microwave.\" I've been wanting to try them, but they're out in Bainbridge and I just don't go out that way very often. Then, alas! I heard they opened a new location in Uptown, near University Circle. Much closer! So I brought the whole family. Nice little place located on the same side of Uptown as Crop Bistro and Mitchell's Ice Cream.

We started with the Trojan Fries - \"a plate of hand-cut fries, covered in melted cheddar, chopped gyro meat and topped with grated parmesan. Enough to share!\" Indeed, it was. It was pretty good - loved the chunks of gyro meat. Not sure I was a fan of the \"melted cheddar\" though... it was the kind that you get with nachos for dipping that probably comes in a bag. Next time, I'd get the melted cheddar on the side. Didn't care that the fries were swimming in the cheese sauce. With these fries, I would have much rather have them with crumbled feta, parsley, garlic.

Kids got the seared pork gyro - built like a classic gyro with applewood bacon. I tried a little bit of because I was curious about the pork. Boy, was it good! Perfectly roasted, juicy and tasty. It was awesome!

I got the Spartan - \"gyros, grilled chicken, applewood smoked bacon, feta, american cheese, mixed greens, red onion & tzaziki on two pitas. Huge!\" Huge, indeed! It came with these huge medallions of gyro meat, the pita lined with chopped grilled chicken, and topped with all the other fixin's. Folks, this is not a meal to be be eaten with your hands. It's too big! I had to use a fork and knife... and I have a big, fat mouth! Probably large enough for two adults to share. It certainly filled me up!

My 6 y/o got the grilled chicken strips and fries. This ain't your standard, pre-made (maybe pre-shaped) chicken strips. These were fresh strips of chicken breast, well-seasoned and home made. My kid enjoyed it!

For the portions you get, prices are very reasonable. Glad they opened a location closer to me. A lot of other interesting items on the menu... such as their premium black Angus burgers. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food in the heart of CWRU campus. The guys working there are great and do not skimp on making Greek food the right way. For good food quickly this is a great choice. The best fries on campus by far! We will be back."}
{"text":"This is great greek food at a reasonable price. Simply greek has a cult following in the area. The specialty dish is the gyro (yee -ros), if you had to order only one thing. However, the burgers, grilled chicken sandwich, greek salad and shrimp saganki are great treats as well. For dessert, the baklava and bananas foster with a greek twist (greek yogurt instead of ice cream), are delicious.

Staff is very courteous and service is efficient.

That said, I'll have to compare this to Steve's gyros as a point of reference for most of you. My verdict: Steve's gyros in the West Side market beats this gyro based on one thing: Steve's gyros are served steaming hot! Steaming hot food adds one more layer of deliciousness in my book. Yup, that's it. Simply Greek's would be a little on the warm side."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in for a late lunch and could not have been happier with our experience. I ordered the Greek Gyro Wrap and my husband had the Greek Salad with Grilled Chicken; both were delicious. The portions were perfect. While we waited to order we were offered a taste of their homemade baklava and it was probably the best baklava I have ever had. I regretted not buying some to take home with me. We are looking forward to coming back and trying more things from their menu. The service was very friendly and fast. Overall, we had a fantastic experience and will definitely be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"My absolute favorite place for a gyro! I actually order a medium and get extra lettuce and eat it like a salad. It's healthy right?  The owner is great! He is always greeting people and taking the time to make each customer feel appreciated! I wish they would open the Solon location! When they were in bainbridge I was a twice a week customer! Try the cheese fries! Another favorite!"}
{"text":"Yum! These gyros were so good! For one, they are HUGE (even just the classic, non-titan, one). They come with so much meat and filling that I often want to ask for an extra pita. The meat is fresh and well seasoned. Since the gyros are so good, I haven't ventured out to try anything else on their menu. Except their fries--those are super fresh and crispy too!

Extra pluses are that they often have baklava samples at the cashier and they have a couple of beers on tap. 

There's parking in the paid lot in the back. In that lot, only 30 minutes are free, but if you park across the street behind Constantino's, that parking lot is 2 hours free. 

I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone in the area. It satisfies my gyro cravings with giant portions and quick service."}
{"text":"These days I'm an athlete as well as a mathlete. And a total \"player\" as well as a sports player. But when I was in Primary School, I was \"simply Geek.\"

However, I don't think even the most tastebud-less of Geeks would really love these Gyros. They're more expensive than almost any in Cleveland, which is a city of very cheap Gyros and mini Gyros (most towns don't offer mini Gyros but the best places in Cleveland do, often for under $5). So already we got off on a bad foot considering I was charged closer to 10 than 5 for a Gyro.

But then the fact that I found the whole thing - bread sugary/store-bought/bland, veggies wilted, sauce bland like sour cream, and meat not particularly flavoured or tasty - to be one of the less good Gyros I've had anywhere. There was a really long wait for it too, and I was starving, so that's further damnation.

I'd recommend Best Gyros (both locations) out east, or Gyro World out West of Cleveland, for the very best in town. The one in West Side Market is not very good either. But I totally support family businesses so I'll give them 3 stars."}
{"text":"Wow!!!!!! Every single thing here is mouth watering delicious. Amazing gyros, we tried original and chicken and they were so good. We will be back ASAP!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to get food near CWRU!

They serve the biggest and best gyro I've ever had, and for only $8! Occasionally I order the $11 gyro to split with my boyfriend and it is enough to leave us both full. Their fries are great too! Oh and don't forget to get a sample of their baklava when you order; that stuff is to die for."}
{"text":"From the outside this place looks like you typical greek grab and go. However, the food is delicious. The fries are excellent and the baklava is some of the best I ever had. This place is well deserving of its high Yelp rating."}
{"text":"This was a great find.  Best gyro I have ever had.  I can't wait to come back. The baklava is no joke either."}
{"text":"Flavors incredible, really friendly service   This place is quite a great find in a nice new location with lots going on in the area."}
{"text":"I love this place. Everything is top class.  The owner is funny and passionate about his craft. The gyro is so huge that I can eat it for 3 days afterwards. The fries are great and the village salad is amazingly good. 

Great value for the money.  I come here everytime I visit Cleveland."}
{"text":"Excellent!  Great Gyros and friendly staff.  The fries are awesome, and the kids meals are a fair price.  The onion rings are great as well."}
{"text":"Amazing food. I stumbled upon the place when I was visiting the MOCA and I've tried to make it back every time I'm home. 

The meat was not the slightest bit dry and the grilled octopus was perfectly cooked. Possibly the best grilled octopus I've had. Portion sizes are very generous. I dragged my entire family there and most of them couldn't finish. Only had a sample of the baklava, but it tasted delicious and wasn't overly sweet. 

The owner is very friendly and has come out so speak with me and whomever I'm with. My first visit he even threw in free wings for us. 

tl;dr: go."}
{"text":"Really nice spot in Uptown/University Circle area. Everything can be made to order. Not the cheapest menu, but the servings are HUGE...almost too much. Definitely will create leftover opportunities. Want to eat in? Not the biggest space but not a bad atmosphere to eat in. They do carry a variety of beers so the selection and the atmosphere sets it apart from any other Greek/Mediterranean option in the area."}
{"text":"I love these types of family owned establishments. This place would be a hit in Beachwood. All I can say is the food was AMAZING!!!!!! Oddly my daughter ordered a burger and I think that it was the best taking burger that I have had in ages. Chargrilled, juicy... WOW!!!!!!!

Roasted chicken was TOPS. A customer came in and bought five whole birds to go. He was raving about them.

Daughter two had an order or chicken wings. Insane. Turkey size wings. 

Wife was satisfied with her wrap. She said the flavors were great.

Server was very nice."}
{"text":"Gyro was on point, as was the beer-battered haddock. Portions are big and prices small. Plus, the rice pudding is as good as it gets. I'm not sure how one can achieve the miracle of rice pudding with only rice, milk, cinnamon, and sugar. Best place in Uptown."}
{"text":"Massive portions for an affordable price. I had the spartan which is essentially two different pita's smashed together and grilled with a bunch of cheese and meat inside."}
{"text":"Phenomenal food and fantastic people! I had a gyro that was amazing and as large as my face! Really delicious. The owner there came out and chatted with us for a while and gave us Cleveland tips and rice pudding and baklava samples. Definitely top restaurant I have been to in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"The best Greek food in The immediate area without question. The service is great, people are nice, and the baklava is the bomb. Worth checking out no doubt!"}
{"text":"Everything I've tasted is delicious and fresh. They have a great menu.  Ive stuck with carry-out (it's close to home). Every time I go in, the waitstaff behind the counter is super friendly."}
{"text":"Very friendly folks. The owners and employees always greet you with a smile.

Food-wise: Very delicious. The Titan is very large and will run you a bit cost wise, but very worth it since it'll last you for at least two solid meals. The amount of hot fries they give you is enormous and pairs well with the gyro.

Lovely place, will come back soon."}
{"text":"Simply spectacular! We ordered take out via Uber from you guys about 2 weeks ago. Wow! We weren't expecting such delicious food. The fries and the gyro were absolutely mouthwatering. We'll definitely be ordering again."}
{"text":"Wow...best authentic Greek food we have had.  Very good value and size and quality. All homemade. Get the Gyro or the Spartan."}
{"text":"We had two gyros and baklava. I'd go back.

Super quick service. Nice staff.

Pretty tight inside, but had plenty of outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Best gyros I ever had....and Ive had a a lot... and in many different countries. People are being critical of wait time???Its a cook to order joint...the wait time is normal."}
{"text":"Really really great food. I had the gyro- with bacon on it. The whole thing was Awesome but the meat was especially delicious. It was huge and I couldn't finish it all. 

Only negative was that food wasn't ready immediately. The owner was working alone and we had to wait about 10 - 15 minutes. Honestly, I had no problem with this- because everything was fresh and made while we waited (along with about 3 other groups that came in at the same time). But, if you're in a huge rush at lunch time, be prepared to wait a tiny bit. 


The owner was great. Baklava and the gyro were amazing. I will definitely be back. Yum."}
{"text":"Best gyro I've ever had!  Great deal for $8.  The owner was very nice and attentive....will definitely be back..."}
{"text":"I've been a student at case for almost 5 years now, and the customer service here is by far the best I've ever experienced at any restaurant near University Circle. Every time I've come, there are free samples of baklava cheesecake.

It goes without saying that the food is great. They have a pretty extensive menu, and you definitely get your money's worth. Get \"the spartan\" and fill yourself up for the rest of the day."}
{"text":"I was really impressed by the quality of the food. Best tzatziki sauce ever! Honestly, it is not fine dining, but what you are getting is top notch...more of a pub setting. Def going to try the octopus next time. The owner is very hands on, nothing comes out second rate. Looking forward to enjoying a meal outside in the courtyard when the weather gets better."}
{"text":"Friendly and fast service.  Huge portions.  Great flavors.  Completely reasonable prices. The souvlaki chicken is perfectly seasoned."}
{"text":"Besides that the food never disappointed me, the service is exceptional as well. I stop by about once a week and the owner and two other staffs always recognize me and even remember my name on my last visit. The thing I like most is that they always check if you are satisfied with your food and if you want to have a bite of their new recipes, and they are always very generous on the samples! 
By the way, give the daily soup a try, I've had two kinds and both of them were good. They pair well with salads."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful. I have been searching for a yummy place to get greek food, and I finally found it! I got the chicken souvlaki and my husband got the angus burger. Both were absolutely delicious!! The staff is very friendly and helpful. I will be coming here often!"}
{"text":"A burger for $11 was on the high  side- especially with no fries- burger was very good !  Cash and check only- hmm"}
{"text":"The food here is great the people who work here are friendly and hilarious. I got to see the friendly banter I only would see on t.v.  and once again to food here is great and quite filling."}
{"text":"I had a nice, quick experience at Simply Greek. I was meeting a friend for a movie at the nearby Cinematheque and had exactly 15 minutes to grab food. I asked the gentleman working what was the quickest thing I could order. To my surprise, a gyro was ready in just moments.

The gyro was awesome! The medium size was more than enough food for me. It had great seasoning and a beyond generous portion of meat. I was able to snag a table (it was an odd time) and enjoy it in peace with plenty of time to spare. All around me, Case kids were coming in and out like crazy holding huge bags of delicious takeout. The menu looked so interesting and I look forward to coming back soon when I'm not trying to eat a gyro in record time like an animal. Thanks for helping me make my movie, Simply Greek! I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"The most amazing food ... I'm coming from Miami I have Greek restaurant and I know what I'm talking about when it comes to Greek food!!! Fresh, delicious, tasty, just amazing.. and the service is the beSt!!! Highly recommended .."}
{"text":"At first I was shocked when my single meal came to twenty bucks, but after I tasted the food it was well worth it!! The fries with bacon an cheese were some of the best fries I ever had! The titan gyro was huge and the meat was very flavorful. The only complaint is that the veggies the put on top could have been a little more crisp."}
{"text":"Consistently excellent! I am often visiting  friends or family on the CWRU campus and I make it a point to eat here. Service is always fast and friendly. Good portion sizes and something for everyone on the menu."}
{"text":"I love an independent restaurant! Some reviewers slam this restaurant because the \"wait\" is too long. Give them a break! They just opened a few weeks ago.  Today I enjoyed a fresh gyro with my sister. The owner greeted us with a friendly smile AND his daughter gave my sister a fresh flower. The food is wonderful. I can actually taste the fresh tomatoes and olives in the Greek salad.  Five stars for the service and food."}
{"text":"The gyro's here are outstanding! They \"medium\" size gyro is huge!! You can't go wrong with Simply Greek. It is located in University Circle, and parking can be a pain but it's worth the stop. They plenty of items on the menu and they serve alcohol as well. They have outside seating for the nice weather."}
{"text":"The food is the delicious and the service was super friendly and fast. You can tell the food was fresh too. The portions were large too so you really fill like you're getting your money's worth. 

The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is my order got messed up. I ordered a burger to go and when I sat down to eat it realized that the cheese and toppings were wrong. This turned out not to be a huge problem because it was still pretty good."}
{"text":"It's a decent options if you are looking for a quick meal. I had once of their gyro's with a topping of feta cheese which works pretty well. They have a few options of beer on tap and bottles/cans. Prices are about average."}
{"text":"Went to eat here after a round of golf nearby.  Walked in and the place was smaller than expected but smelled pretty good.  I asked the older lady behind the glass if we could change the tv to the basketball.  She was so rude about my request stating I would have to wait.  I was then handed the remote and changed the channel to her request ( not to have the game sound on). She continued to bitch to the point me and my buddy left without even ordering.  I really want to support small places but I will not put up with attitude.  Never did get to try the food.
 (In response to the owner response)

The correct response from a real business owner is \"Sorry about the misunderstanding.  We hope to gain your business\".  That is how customer service is done.   You are so incorrect of the situation that it is laughable.  First of all, we do not drink when golfing and even if we did it would have to be a lot of beer for me to have a \"pink\" face since I am African American!!!  This just proves how ridiculous your response is.  Did your \"cameras\" not pick that up??  I referenced \"older lady\" because there were two ladies working and I did not want to call out the younger lady who I had not interaction with.   I support and actually have owned small business and I would have never treated my customers the way we were treated.  But by your response,  I  can see that it comes from the lack of leadership and professional they receive from the top.  Trust me, I will never visit your establishment again and I will make sure that my friends in Chargin (and I have quite a few) and my friends on social media are fully aware of your customer service."}
{"text":"My son and I walked here from the art museum. Owner took our order. Very nice guy. We both had gyros and they were huge and excellent. The fries are hand cut and very good.
Food came out quick and was hot. 
Great lunch place. I wish it was near where I lived!"}
{"text":"Just as tasty! I was a big fan when they were at their first location still. Finally I was in the area for an appointment at University Hospital and stopped by for lunch. Gyro, just good; fries, tasty as always; smelts, nicely fried and fresh; baklava, still the best! 

I think it's safe to assume that everything is just as good as it was in the original location. Especially since it is still owned and operated by the same people! I missed this place, can't wait for them to have a location near me again. They said they will be opening a second location in Solon."}
{"text":"Judging off the one (albeit HUGE) gyro I've had from this place, it's tasty! My dad bought each of us the \"Titan\" gyro. Needless to say, I could only finish half. Only thing missing was the tzaziki sauce. I could see, but I couldn't taste it.

And now I'm wondering if they have baklava...."}
{"text":"The freshest, best tasting food in town.  Prices are fair. Portions are large. Greek doesn't get better."}
{"text":"Discovered this gem while looking for a lunch spot playing Pokémon Go in University Circle. Small hole in the wall type place but everything from the service to the food and drinks were top notch. I got the Bree Burger- absolutely delicious. Topped with Applewood smoked bacon, sautéed spinach and Jack Daniels' battered onion rings. Good craft beers on tap. Will definitely be making a trip out here from Elyria again."}
{"text":"I was a big fan of Wrapz Pita Bar (the previous business in this location, RIP), but I have to say that this place is pretty unreal.

Kind of hidden away behind the Triangle apartments, so it doesn't get that much foot traffic unless you're in the know, but once you find it, you're in for a real treat.

Since the beginning, Simply Greek had massive portions of various kinds of Greek/Mediterranean and contemporary American options, including some TREMENDOUSLY portioned gyros, burgers, and some tasty desserts. For the price, it's a steal. Since then, they're also installed a bar on the back wall with reasonably priced drinks (beer + liquor), which is a nice touch.

Recommendations? Honestly, everything. The Spartan Gyro is a two-pita pile of meat, tomatoes, onions, and yogurt sauce, and it's something you might not be able to finish, but it makes for amazing leftovers. My girlfriend loves the baklava there, and my friend is a fan of the rice pudding. The menu is a bit cluttered, but that just means that I'll have to try everything at some point, right?"}
{"text":"Came back here after almost a year of hiatus. I ordered the chicken dinner, shrip dinner, and a burgur. EVERYTHING was done well. Seasoning was amazing. The fies were fresh and crispy. The ckicken was well done. The shrimp was amazing."}
{"text":"This is a definite try for the Bainbridge area. The restaurant employees are extremely friendly and their customer service earned 5 stars. The food exceeded my expectations which I believe has to do with the curb appeal of the location. The outside awnings are outdated and are not pleasing to the eye and a lack of parking spaces. This can be a giant turnoff to customer decisions but once inside the atmosphere is great. Must try!"}
{"text":"Fantastic authentic greek food.  This place is definitely a hidden gem of University Circle as it's not easily visible from the street."}
{"text":"Wow!  What a difference it makes having an owner on site ensuring you have a great experience!  We stopped in based upon reviews.  So very glad we did!  

This isn't a \"fancy sit-down\" place.  It's an \"order at the counter & they bring your food shortly\" place, and a very good one.  Our order was taken by the owner himself, who explained many of the dishes are his mother's recipes.  He had samples of the baklava right there, which was a great sales tactic, because we added some to our order!  My husband got a burger and I got Souvlaki, and we shared an order of Saganaki accompanied by fresh lemon wedges, Kalamata olives, and feta.  It isn't served flaming at the table, but was very delicious nonetheless.

The food is beautifully presented, fresh, & delicious.  They are generous with the fillings of the Souvlaki, which was overflowing with chicken, feta and very delicious house made Tzatziki.  The pitas were pillowy and fresh.  We enjoyed every bite.  

The owner came over & chatted with us after we finished, just to make sure everything was to our satisfaction.  Terrific food & service here, and not only will we be back on our next visit to Cleveland, but highly recommend it to others!!"}
{"text":"Almost unbelievably fast Gyros! The staff and owner are super friendly and offers free samples of baklava when you come (the baklava is delicious). Good local beer selection, gyro island, plenty to like here. The gyros are big (even the regular size is 14-16oz) and incredibly flavorful so don't miss this one when you're around University circle!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for a quick dinner before heading to Severance Hall. The Gyros were GREAT - the Baklava authentic - loved them both. Employees were friendly and professional. The owner/manager stopped by to make sure all was well with our food.

Beware, the interior is very small. We chose to eat inside at the window bar since everyone else was eating outside. Interior décor is fun and the music lively.

Yes, we would recommend Simply Greek! Now we need to try their Solon location!"}
{"text":"I met the owner and his son was cooking. Quality guys and impeccable food. As a traveling professional I try to find the best food a city has to offer. Quality food is great but s good convo goes a long way. Keep it up guys the food is impeccable!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  Make sure
You come here with an appetite because they won't skimp on the portions!  Most of all the customer service is awesome, they are so nice!"}
{"text":"Excellent gyros with the good, authentic sauce.   The owner works his tail off and his pride comes out in the quality.  The dining room is quite small and I prefer to take out and eat at home."}
{"text":"Their Greek Salad is the BEST in NE Ohio. Highly recommended. Great ownership and staff. Great Food.
A++++++++++"}
{"text":"This place was a great find. I always prefer to go to locally owned and operated establishments, rather than chains, whenever I can help it; and this place is emblematic of why. The food was great, and the character of the restaurant really shown through. Highly recommend the french fries in particular!"}
{"text":"Not only is the food amazing, the service is top notch. My husband and I got way more food than we expected for the price. They even went out out of their way to cut up a banana, cucumbers, and chicken for our two year old to eat without us asking and free of charge. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Peter is one funny, cool dude!  
We read the wonderful reviews and had to give Simply Greek a try...ordered pickup and upon entering the establishment the lively vibe just hit us smack in the face.  Had a great conversation while they made the \"meats\" in a quick minute to ensure it being hot n fresh.  Excellent experience!  The gyro was humongous, I really wanted more Tzaziki sauce, note to self - next time get more Tzaziki on the side.
So, I digress.  Anywho, when we get to the hotel we realize there is no Bakalva.  We immediately call back for yet another pickup.  What happened next was definitely over and beyond!  They had the Bakalva and some other home made freebies (homemade rice pudding) delivered to our room!  Way cool, eh?
And if all this wasn't dreamy enough -- the food was delicious!  Tons of succulent meats in the Gyro, the chicken in the salad just melted in your mouth!  Well, out of this world good.  Finally, the Bakalva is something you DO write home about - a definite must have if you are in Cleveland!
Here's to you Pete or Nick, my man!  Until the next time we're in the Land...Stin ygeiá sas!"}
{"text":"We came here visiting from Indianapolis. Very good Greek food, very large portions and very good value. The only drawback is the wait time and having to wait for wine to come out with your food."}
{"text":"If you need to fill in your tummy with great delicious food this is the right place for you. I often visit this place with my friends and we have always been catered with great customer service. The management is very helpful and cater the customers with finesse. 

I have tried gyro meat and Spartan fries here. Both are very tasty, juicy and flavorful. The baklava when made fresh is very good."}
{"text":"So. Much. Food.

Have been here a few times and it's always busy. The cashier lady offered us a sample of baklava, then said, I'll be right back... hooked us. Got gyros, fries... and baklava. They pile the meat up high, enough for two meals. 

Yum."}
{"text":"I visited Simply Greek about two weeks for the first time. My mom was getting treatment at Seidman and she wanted something to eat , so I decided to try them out, man I'm so happy I did. my mom and I loved the gyros! Added bonus the gentleman at the cash register was very friendly!"}
{"text":"Very nice place. Baklava was tasty. The Greek salad was amazing, nice and fresh. 
Lastly, very good customer service. 
Will be back very soon."}
{"text":"Really love this place. I've never eaten in before because I do take out all the time but it's great! I always get the salmon or the gyro!! Both are flavorful and filling! I also love the service, the guy there is super nice and fun! Delivery is fast too! Love going here!!"}
{"text":"Coming from out of state to visit family nearby, we called while driving and ordered two pounds of shaved gyro meat and some pitas to carry out. They said about ten minutes, we were there in eight minutes, and everything was ready to go. Food was warm and tasty, just as it was the last time we had it. Service was fast and friendly and we were quickly on our way. We have had Steve's Gyros which we liked. But for this side of town I thought the taste was as good as Steve's and less traffic and parking to deal with. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"They have amazing Fries here!  The staff is really cool and though its a small place it has a great atmosphere.  Have been there twice and plan on returning."}
{"text":"An absolute must try if you're anywhere near by. The food is fantastic. I've had most things on the menu (burger is amazing - get it with bacon and cheese and you'll thank me later). It's a bit of a hidden gem but I've recommended this place to most of my friends and they always have only good things to say about it. Nothing fails to disappoint and there is plenty of food so come hungry. This is definitely one of my favorite places to eat nearby. It replaced chipotle and jimmy john's as a weekly meal for the same price but 2x the deliciousness and 4x the quality of food. Give it a shot!"}
{"text":"Very tasty gyro, they definitely give you a lot of meat, which I LOVE. I got the classic gyro and I ate about half/three quarters in one sitting (I am a girl though). They've offered free samples both times I've been (baklava and some other dessert). I haven't tried anything on the menu other than the classic gyro yet."}
{"text":"Second time at this place, but forgot that they make bible comments on signs in front of their restaurant, have Fox News talking heads on the TV inside and generally just make me feel politically charged and dirty walking in the place whether I agree with their views or not.
Its got better parking and is more accessible traffic-wise, but food wise, Simply Greek is just not quite as good as the Best Gyro locations that I've been to and the prices are higher and it seemed like the wait is longer. Maybe that was because they were pushing their beliefs on me.
I think I'm done going there; a salad, 3 gyros and some fries were $50...."}
{"text":"One of the best places to eat out here.  The food is always fantastic and fresh.  The service and the friendly atmosphere is excellent!!!  Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Great lunch option in easy walking distance of Case. Very tasty food (veggie gyro and fries), bustling yet inviting space, and prompt friendly service. I have every intention of coming back again in the future, especially for a quick but delicious lunch between meetings. Give it a shot!"}
{"text":"Awesome gyro. The owner was so nice. He let me bring ice cream from Mitchell's next door and made me a dessert with it and baklava."}
{"text":"Fantastic!  Fresh. Tzatziki made w low fat Greek yogurt. Calimari marinated with peppers and onions then lightly fried. Goodness. Baklava with perfect filling ratio. Go."}
{"text":"The gyro was fantastic, loaded with lots of meat and fresh veggies. The Trojan fries were drenched in cheese... which was just okay.

The patio was great for our dog to relax - they even brought out a dog dish with water for her.

Definitely would get the gyro again."}
{"text":"I went here yesterday based on reviews form a family member. Immediately after I walked through the door I was offered a fresh sample of baklava, which was amazing. I was surprised by the beer and food selection. I ended up ordering a gyro with no tomatoes and an order of fries. The fries were great and had a hint of rosemary. The gyro was also delicious as well as huge. I can't stress enough how surprised I was with the quantity and quality. The food was great. I hate to reference another restaurant but the gyro was about the size of a chipotle burrito. Overall, I will be returning to Simply Greek to further explore the menu and will be recommending it to friends as well."}
{"text":"Won't miss this place, due to the stupid political signs. Best of luck in Solon. Good riddance."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch on a Saturday afternoon.  Perfect spot lunch.  The food was prepared fresh and served quickly.  We ate at one of the tables inside.  The octopus was tasty and tender. Also had grape leaves and a chicken wrap.  Nice they have beer wine and cocktails if you want.  Truly a great find. 
We will be back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, all made fresh to order with fresh ingredients, large portions and good prices, very friendly staff and helpful in providing recommendations and samples of different menu items, delicious gyros"}
{"text":"This place was great.  HUGE portions and really flavorful food.  The owners were friendly and generous and checked to see how we were enjoying our food.  By far the best Greek food I have tasted in all of Ohio!  I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I don't write many reviews, even though I use Yelp ALL the time.  This place was so exceptional, I had to write a review.  GREAT gyros (even better than Steve's at West Side Market), and they're one of the few places that really knows how to do fries. The guy behind the counter was super friendly - I think he may be the owner.  This was truly great food!"}
{"text":"I came here a few times, but never had an opportunity to review.  To say the least, it is the best Greek food I had in the Cleveland area.  I suggest getting the classic gyro, which you cannot go wrong with.  Their service is great and will be coming here often in the summer.  :)"}
{"text":"So much meat on that lamb gyro! I'm new to the area and this is definitely a go to place already. Tons of food for the price. Oh, and their baklava is delicious too, plus beer on tap."}
{"text":"Food is fantastic, and prices are fine.   Always get free samples from wonderfully friendly staff.  Sometimes it is free chicken wings, sometimes its rice pudding and baklava.   Gyro is my favorite in town.   Worth my drive out every time."}
{"text":"The best Greek place in Cleveland! 
We had chicken and it's really good. 
They also have burgers tho. The fries are crispy and well seasoned. Me and my wife will b definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. I tried the classic gyro, Greek salad, and yogurt parfait. One of the best gyros I have ever had and the parfait was beyond delicious. The parfait was made with goat's milk and topped with fruit, honey, and granola. I would go back just for the parfait. Most important to me was how kind and friendly the employees were. They were very accommodating to us dining in and to everyone else coming and going. If you want delicious and very authentic Greek food, you must try Simply Greek!"}
{"text":"Delicious gyros! I really like their tzatziki sauce and the meat is seasoned perfectly. I also got saganaki for and opa-tizer and it was amazing! The owner is a really nice guy and gave us phenomenal service. Definitely a new favorite spot! I am looking forward to going back soon to try more off the menu."}
{"text":"Small, quaint and friendly. I'm almost a regular. The gyros are the best, the real deal. You can get a salad with the gyro lamb meat, too. I was pleasantly pleased to see specials taped to the window. I tried the grilled octopus. I like octopus, and I've had it prepared many ways, but grilled was the first. Delicious!  Four tentacles, seasoned perhaps with garlic and oregano, were very tender. Some octopus can be rubbery. Kudos to the chef. As usual we also ordered the Titan fries. French fries with cheese and gyro meat. A meal!"}
{"text":"What a fantastic meal! Everything about my first visit to Simply Greek was a delight and it has earned a spot in my rotation of regular destinations for weekly dining-out. 

On our first visit we sampled:

- The Chicken Dinner platter: a healthy, beautifully grilled, flavorful, well-spiced portion of chicken - crisp on the outside and juicy on the inside + a delicious salad, fresh, homemade tzaziki, and a side of fries. A perfect meal! 
- The Spartan Gyro - delicious, velvety gyro meat with fresh vegetables and tzaziki sauce. As the menu states, this sandwich is HUGE! My husband, who has a rapacious appetite, could only get through half of it. We took the other half home and turned it into two omelettes for breakfast! 
- A side of french fries that were top-notch: crispy, piping hot, salty, and not too greasy!
- BAKLAVA: some of the best I've ever had!

I would recommend this place to anyone who loves fresh, flavorful food at a good price point in a casual atmosphere. Five stars!"}
{"text":"What a treat simply Greek was to our taste buds. We had a craving for Mediterranean and this café surpassed our expectations. The staff and owners were helpful and friendly. The Giro sandwich was a bouquet of meat and vegetables tender and full of flavor. The sauce was the best yet made with fresh ingredients. Do you try the corned lamb it was wonderful tasty juicy and tender. The fries were perfectly made, an excellent accompaniment to beer. Can't wait for next trip up to Cleveland as we will be eating at simply Greek again."}
{"text":"The Verdict: Best Greek in town!

The Food: Gryos is where it's at. I love it when the culture sticks to it's food and flavors and ACES it! The sauces are great, the meat is flavorful, just be ready for a mess on your hands cause the gyros aren't small! And they entice you with a sample of baklava and oh boy! It's hard to say no! They've got rice pudding too if that's what you like!

The Extras: No service, you just order @ the cashier. If you can't find it, it's behind Panera bread, just walk under the building between Panera and Chipotle, there's also usually signs pointing to where it is. The owner and workers are lively and they've got a great selection of beers to go with your meal!"}
{"text":"simply Greek is fantastic. the gyro meat is delicious, and their pitas are the best I've ever had! Even though the food itself is to die for, the hospitality by the owner and environment is second to none. Every time I have been there, the owner personally took my order, offered a free sample of baklava and engaged in a lively discussion. He would then proceed to take your food to your table and make sure you are comfortable. After I was done, he came up to me, made sure I was happy with everything, and offered me free rice pudding, which was phenomenal (I normally don't like rice pudding).

10/10 would go back again!"}
{"text":"I came here for a late lunch. I had the small Greek salad and gyro. It was a ton of food. Everything was great. I see myself becoming a regular at this place.  If I could give it 6 stars, I would"}
