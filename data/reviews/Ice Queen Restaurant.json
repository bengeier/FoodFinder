{"text":"i have to agree with Shinyi very weird crowd and i can handle rough places.They have to own the building, you could not pay rent selling 3 dollar beers to alcoholics living in nearby roominghouse. very brave to order food the bathroom was bad enough.lower roncy could use a good biker bar, someone needs to take it over."}
{"text":"I am not surprised that I am the first to review.
I must also disclose that this will be one the few times that I will write a review based on ONE visit - I normally like to visit at least twice but I would like to live to see another day, and I'm afraid that may not happen if I go there again.

Background: me and few friends had been eyeing this spot for a while; but it gave an eerie feeling and we never ventured. Believing in the power in numbers and in the spirit of adventure, 3 of us went - apparently that was not enough.

The decor? non-existent.
menu? well, most were not available but regular pub food. We got burgers and onion rings and pitcher of beer. I will say that was the crispiest rings ever!made me miss Harvey's onion rings very much. Hamburgers were bland and had a home-made quality, definitely filling. The BLT sandwich was just that: bacon, lettuce, tomato between toasts - nothing else....for $4.

Based on the above, I would have returned except, things got weird. 
The crowd there - sketchy at best (but in that weirdly frightening way- not in the Parkdalian kinda way ), is what would prevent the second visit.

People were watching us, music turned out loudly and someone on his way out to pee(I'm told), stopped behind my friend and gave me a look. A few minutes later, my friends who are born and raised in the small town ways, strongly advised that i finish the beer - and I did as I was told.
As we left, someone half way followed us and another man started screaming - and the staff were nonchalant and indifferent about a mini-fight or the strange group of people just hovering the counter; they weren't going to help us if anything happened.

So.
If you are feeling brave and adventurous, this is where you go. Otherwise, Ronsey is filled with other joyful spots than this, where you don't feel life threatened."}
{"text":"Super super weird place. Says it's a restaurant but they only had fish and chips on the menu. Groups of homeless people sitting in groups and drinking beer. My son studies at Kumon next door & I was starving- wouldn't have come otherwise. 

They've got a pool table though. If you're looking for $3 beer, love the smell of urine and are feeling adventurous I highly recommend it."}
