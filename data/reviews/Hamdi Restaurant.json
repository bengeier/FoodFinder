{"text":"It was about 2 weeks ago at Monday. I paid 16 $ for both me and my husband! And took some leftover home! The food tasted amazing the service was fast and accurate . We were the only ones there and I assume that that was the owner in the back of the restaurant who couldn't decide what to watch on tv so every couple minutes flip the channel .I enjoyed the food and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Good eats, reasonable prices and great mango juice, how can you go wrong!
Had chicken breast with rice and drumsticks - all delicious.

highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Love this place!

Its a rather old joint. No surprises there.
I appreciate the hand washing station and of course that there is a baby changing table in the bathroom. Thumbs up!

The food vs. price, you get more than you pay for.
The servings are hugeee!
My hubby and I usually split one platter.
mango juice is nice, and of course the banana tradition.

The place has two rooms to choose from, one is the \"family room\" which I really like.
Service is quick and pleasant.

Wonderful Halal option!

I highly recommend! We go back often, and now have many friends and family that always eat there when in the area. It is a no brainer if you are in the Rexdale area, you must give it a try!"}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday afternoon and it was packed with lineups. Unsure on how to proceede I decided to lineup. So I thought of doing a takeout as it was packed. After a few minutes I founs a seat and decided to dine in. I informed the waiter that i would be dining in instead of takeout but i still got take put. Without any fuss i decided to eat out of the take out containers. I noticed a piece of plastic in my food and thought it might be some part of the goat...lol....so I called the waiter...he was so embarrassed that he apologized and said he would get me a new order. I said it was ok and no big deal. He insisted that I get a new order. I told him I had no issues with the plastic so he said I could do a takeout and get another order for free. I was quite happy as the food tasted good! I ordered the goat shoulder.
FYI mango drink and/or lemonade is FREE!"}
{"text":"~A Solid 3.5 Stars~

I was at this location for lunch with coworkers and we really enjoyed our meals. We walked in and seems like the norm was to take a seat and grab a menu. Then you have order at the till. 

The server was very friendly and helpful in taking our order. 

The menu is very nice and full of flavourful options, and great for meat lovers. I ordered their Beef Stew with spaghetti. The beef was juicy and very will seasoned and tender, the meal also came with a side salad and a drink (water, pop or juice). My coworkers order Wasalad (Goat Shoulder) and Chicken Steak both loved their dishes and meat was tender.The food came in a very timely fashion and was hot. The portion size were amazing and filling. 

They also had a mini bakery area with very nice cakes but we were too full with our meal to even have slice.

Overall, a decent joint to check out.

For my Muslim folks - They serve halal meat."}
{"text":"called in to order about 5 times before. when arriving there they never have it ready. whats the point of taking orders on the phone? they always ask what did you order and then goes to the back to make the food even though you made the order on the phone 30 mins ago...

terrible terrible terrible...they should shut this place down. terrible service."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday for iftar when we were in the line to order food for about ten mins..during which we heard the adhan, but we were not offered any water or anything at all to break the fast. Luckily we had some water on us. The food took about 45 mins to get to us, was nothing like we expected. We drove all the way from markham and I had called twice to confirm they serve Alfredo, upon Alfredo the lady apologized and said they don't serve Alfredo but some white gravy. Returned the food and went to another restaurant. Awful customer service. If you're busy hire more staff and at least be courteous enough to offer water."}
{"text":"My Somali friend wanted to introduce me to his native cuisine.
With no Somali restos in Montreal, we made it a point to visit here while in Toronto.

It's a bit out of the way, so really just if you're coming by car, 
It's in a dingy strip mall, and the decor is very basic.
But I wouldn't have it any other way when it comes to ethnic food.

While at first glance, their menu might seem expensive ($13-$15)
It does come with an amazing spicy vegetable soup and bottled water is free.
Soft drinks and large juices are only $1. 

You also get to choose from Chicken, Goat, Fish and Steak (which they did not have on that day)

The fried chicken was very simple, tasted fresh and homemade.
I'm not a fan of Goat (too stringy) , but it was quite good, the Fish was also nice.

What stood out to me was the sides, the rice was perfect, it looked like Basmati.

The other thing that surprised me was their use of spaghetti (they were colonized by Italy), it was the best pasta I've had all year, the sauce and the cooking was perfect.

They do it eat it with a banana to temper the spices (it was not really spicy to me)

The waiter was very quiet and un-assuming, they have a family section and the section where we stayed.

They opened a second section in downtown Toronto, here's hoping to a section in Montreal"}
{"text":"Very good food and wonderful and smiling people working there.
Prices and quantity is well balanced.
a must visit place."}
{"text":"A great casual place to dine. I came here for the cultural food and found their roasted lamb amazing! Their portion sizes are massive. We opted for the optional platter for two and my spouse and I were presented with a massive platter with both of our orders on it. Pretty cool. Their bottomless mango/grapefruit juice is a nice touch with every meal."}
{"text":"Came here for take out --their roasted lamb shoulder meal.  This place does NOT skimp on portion size!!!  All mains seem to top out at $14-16, and for that you get a SIZEABLE portion of whatever you order.  The lamb was tender, juicy, not fall-off-the-bone like I really like, but pretty close.  The rice was ample, and delicately flavoured.  The side veggies were really just meh.  I would give it a higher ranking, but next time I'll try their suqaar and see if the really deserve it..."}
{"text":"The portions are great, one order 2 ladies or 2 kids can easily share...it's fulfilling for men too.  I think price is right too.  6 adults and 4 kids ate for about $100.  the sauce is very spicy, but tasty, so when you want to pour it all over be ready to have your drink right after the first bite :) its bz for a small place.  will be back."}
{"text":"I was there a few months ago with my family. As we started eating, noticed a cockroach with it's egg crawling by the table wall. Immediately lost appetite and left the place. That was the last time will ever go."}
{"text":"Halal meat is served here. Went here for dinner with party of 9. the service was a little slow (waited awhile to get our mango juices) but the food was very good. Had the t-bone steak plate with rice. Also tried some of the beef stew which was very good. The spaghetti was good as well. The chicken steak i tried had a bit of a fishy taste to it, but other people in my party did not have that issue. Overall it was a nice experience. Will have to come again next time I am in Toronto."}
{"text":"Have only ordered beef steak every time I have been here (which is quite a lot) because it's that good. Comes with rice and salad. Add tons of their home made hot sauce and you have a feast in front of you. 

All meals are generally priced between $10-$12 (incl tax) and come with unlimited mango juice (delicious!) and complementary tea (too damn sweet for me!)

Great place for a casual meal with friends."}
{"text":"Not as great as Cafe Sinai when it was still there, but if I'm craving t-bone steak and chicken stew, this is the place to go to!"}
{"text":"Hamdi, Hamdi, Hamdi. I expect better from a place with a name that is so fun to say.

I'd never tried Somali cuisine before coming here, and unfortunately, Hamdi didn't offer the greatest introduction to it. I ordered the chicken stew for $12. It came on a large plate - there were a few pieces of lettuce on the side, about three ounces of meat (not much), and a humongous mound of rice and peas. The meat was nicely cooked and flavourful, but I just didn't know what to do with myself or all that rice. I polished off the lettuce and meat, but had an overwhelming amount of rice leftover at the end... It wasn't spiced or anything, so I couldn't enjoy it by itself.

I left the place feeling like I got ripped off... The food was decent, but I wasn't satiated, and it definitely wasn't worth the (already inexpensive) price. It was a meal I could easily throw together at home in 20 minutes. Also, I despise bottled water (as I feel like it's a waste when we have perfectly good tap water), and that's all they serve at Hamdi."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place. Could be a little more organized and cleaner.

Overall, the food was delicious, mango juice was great and unlimited, and the service was friendly. We ordered the beef stew with the chicken drumsticks. Great flavours.

This place could use a little more lighting, we found it a little dim.

Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Went there last night and had the roasted goat. It was served with rice and vegetables and a salad. The food was very flavorful and plentiful. The price was very cheap. The ironic part was that they were watching the Republican Presidential Debated."}
{"text":"For a very long time now, Hamdi's has always held a place among my favorate restaurants in Toronto.  

To put it nicely, the ambience and the service are the least of what you should be going here for.  Hamdi's is a Somalian restaurant that offers wonderful meat and rice platters made for a small family/group (2-4 people) to share.  

Each platter comes on a very large pizza sized plate.  This platter is essentially covered with your choice of either spaghetti or rice as your base.  I personally prefer the spaghetti but most people will tend to like the rice so i like to recommend going half and half and getting the best of both worlds.  After choosing your base, you have the choice of choosing 2-4 entrees which are served directly on top of your rice/spaghetti platter.  Popular options generally include beef steak, chicken steak, beef stew, fried chicken drum sticks, or king fish.  By far, my favorate dish off the menu is the beef stew and the second choice usually varies by mood and who else im with.  

Mind you, because the entrees are served together on a large platter, the whole idea behind this is that the customers will be eating off of the same large plate.  If sharing food and eating off the same plate is not something that you think you would enjoy, than this place is not for you.  I tend to think that this place actually illustrates how there is no better way to enjoy a meal than to share it with the ones you love!  

The actual foods taste great.  I'd compare Somalian food to a very subtle and less spicey version of indian food.  They also serve roti here however i found that a bit dry and hard in comparison to the kind you'd find in a Pakistani or Indian restaurant...and thus i dont recommend that so much.  Aside from the food, the best thing about this restaurant is that they have unlimited mango juice and/or grapefruit juice for $1!!!  The meal itself is about $9 and so all in all...you get stuffed til your stomach hurts, rehydrated with litre after litre of mango juice and then a teased with a complimentary banana to conclude your meal.  I still dont get why you get a banana after such a heavy meal but i still tend to love it!

Somalian food is probably not for everyone however if you're adventurous and wanna try something different and new, give it a go and i hope that you're not dissappointed!  

Salaams!
ps. this establishment serves halal food."}
{"text":"What happened to this place??!! Guess the renovation killed the quality of their food... This was an utter disappointment. Absolutely no flavour ..i honestly felt like I was eating overly boiled meat n veggies... N exactly just that.. What a sad lunch it was..."}
