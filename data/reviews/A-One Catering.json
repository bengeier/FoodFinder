{"text":"Samosas ordered for funeral reception. 75 beef @.90/piece and 75 veg @.60/piece. Definitely not inexpensive but they were large. 
Vegetable were hot and tasty. Unfortunately the beef ones were fridge cold inside. Apparently it is my duty to advise them that I need HOT samosas. I called the first time to order and was not  asked as Kay rushed through order. Called again on morning of pickup and was told \"yeah yeah yeah they will be ready\". I called to find out why samosas were cold and was told \"next time tell us you want them hot\" , \"bring them back if you want a refund or we can make them for tomorrow...\", \"you want a refund for 75 samosas?\"  I didn't ask for a full refund but would have been happy being offered a partial credit of even a dozen samosas in the form of voucher for the future. Instead I got a long lecture from Kay (owner and manager)about how they cook the beef samosas early in the morning and then put them in the fridge because of the health inspector but the veg ones are cooked all day and that's why they are hot. I was also told by her \"that if I was a vegetarian like her, I would appreciate the fact that they are cooked separately\". I told her that I had no problem with that but that when they take orders they should advise their customers as well as have the right information on their website. Customer service is non existent as no credit or solution was offered just an apology and a directive to make sure I tell them I need them hot for next time...like that is going to happen. 
Samosas were okay even if cold but the attitude from both Kay and her brother left a VERY bad taste in my mouth.
Best samosas are at Sultan of Samosa!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of, if not, the best samosas in the GTA! 
Crispy, fresh, adequately spiced- these \"British style\" veggie pockets are the bomb!

Service is terribly lacking...only ONE person working the counter with a huge line-up? Seriously?

Spent nearly my entire lunch break waiting in line; and service is slow, like really slow! 
Explains why the line up is ALWAYS so long at this place. So.. if you're in a rush, don't even bother!

Sweets are also good , especially the jalebi...yum yum :P

Overall, still one of the best place for samosas, just be prepared to wait...and wait!

***A-One: Please listen to your customers and hire MORE staff! It's a win-win for everyone!"}
{"text":"One of the best Indian food places in GTA. The samosa chaat is better than that offered by many places I have eaten at in India! Wow
This place is a hidden gem.
There's always a steady stream of people in line .
I should of bought more....."}
{"text":"The Service is slow as only one person is working in the front, although she was friendly but they need people in front to keep the line moving as some people might only need samosas and don't want the sweets, which takes time specially if you are coming down during lunch time.

It nice to get large amount of samosas without pre-ordering. The veg samosas a little expensive as you get one for $0.60 usually you 3 for a $1 at other places. The samosas were crispy, fresh, and had a nice little kick to it."}
{"text":"Samosas are good but we didn't liked the veg pakoras. If you are going there then you must try veg samosa and paneer samosa. They used too much gram flour in veg pakoras so we didn't liked it."}
{"text":"Best somosa's I've ever had. Partial to the chicken."}
{"text":"Great place for samosas and Indian sweets.  Vegetable samosas are 75 cents each so bring cash and order a dozen for $9 because you can't just eat one...or two...or three!

Over two decades, the samosas are still fantastic but the prices have crept up plus the size has reduced.  I remember getting 3 large pieces for $1.  Still, I feel this is the best samosas in the west end of the GTA.

This place is usually very busy.  The staff take and process your order quickly; just know what you want when asked.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We have always gone to this location for Samosas and other appetizers. Most of the time we don't need to call in for a pick. But it does depend on how big the order is. The food has always tasted great. Never had any issues with the food being cold or not fresh. Samosas and spring rolls from here are the best compared to other things. If you haven't had a chance to try a Indian samosa you should definitely try one from here. They do have different types of Samosas as well like chicken or the regular one. I believe they did have beef at one point. Not sure if they still have one there. But overall, I love the samosas from this store."}
{"text":"Ok, I think this place is legendary.  People don't come here to buy a couple of samosas, they come here to buy a couple of boxes of samosas.  Used to work by here and the place is just insane, my coworkers would go in and buy tons of samosas as if they weren't coming back to work the next day and have close access to the store.  The samosas here are light, fluffy, have nicely spiced potatoes, green pea, cumin etc.  pakoras are good as well, but their specialty are samosas.  To my surprise, this place is even known to my old work crew back in Toronto."}
{"text":"Disregard the previous feedbacks, here is the feedback from a pro samosa eater. Samosas here are tasty but bit costlier.Than many samosa shops in Brampton. If to find the best and affordable samosas in Brampton area, the best places are one on Airport road and Derry East. And Indian sweet master on Ray Lawson and Mclaughlin. 3 samosas for a dollar are better than 2 for 1 $. As long as taste, and ingredient are same."}
{"text":"Drove 19 km as had a craving for samosas. The line to the door told me we were in the right place. Grease soaked bag was first sign of potential greatness. Second was the light flaky pastry/dough, not heavy. Third was the delicious filling. They had vegetable, chicken or beef samosas. All were flavourful with only a hint of curry, not overpowering. Couldn't give a higher rating as place had no signage with names and prices plus they forgot to give us sauce for the samosas."}
{"text":"Best samosas in Mississauga. The sweet sauce that comes with the samosas takes it to another level."}
{"text":"Best Samosas by far. 

The shell is light and flaky not like all the other places. They are always fresh and always delicious. I always get chicken and/or veggie and they are simply the best I've ever had in the GTA/Toronto region. Also the chutney is bomb!"}
{"text":"Terrible service, terrible attitude, unhelpful as hell.

Still, it's the best friggin samosa around..  the reputation is well deserved.

I've never tried their other food but looking at pics of John C.'s pakoras make me definitely want to try it on my next visit.

Hell, I might just go there this afternoon now...

Damn, this place is dope!

I buy the veggie samosas"}
{"text":"Probably the best samosa's I'ver ever had!"}
{"text":"For cheap delicious samosas this is the place. Kinda out of nowhere. This review is solely on their samosas. I have not tried anything else. Try it with the tamerine sauce. Lots of flavor with a little bit of spice."}
{"text":"Agreed! 
Best samosas in the GTA & the sauce, oh my, the yummy red sauce - so good. 
Stick with the veggie samosas. There're the best."}
{"text":"They have the BEST samosas in the GTA!!! Stick to the veggie samosas - you never go wrong with those!"}
{"text":"The best samosas..........veg are my favourite.
Great variety of sweets, butter chicken and all the popular indian fair."}
