{"text":"Very nice and clean modern atmosphere. My wife, not a big Asian restaurant fan, felt very comfortable. They offer custom-made noodle, rice or salad bowls where you choose your ingredients and they stir-fry them for you on the spot. Great flavours, fresh ingredients and a chef who cares and watches your reaction as you bite into it."}
{"text":"In an effort to expand my Bloor Street horizons beyond the tasteless sushi in Metro on my lunch hour, I tried Walk In Wok out for the first time last week. The place is clean and nice, and the food is consistenly good. (Lately I've been seeing more people in there so pehaps the Mozilla team is see progress on this project.) My only complaints about this place are the portions (HUGE! but so good I can't resist eating it all) and the prices - too high for this neighbourhood. Lunch is easily $13 every time I go in - that's for a carb, a sauce a protein and a few veggies. Then again, if I split it with a colleague I'd have both probelms solved, wouldn't I? 

All in all, Walk In Wok Out is a nice addition to the take out landscape and has much higher quality food than other fast food asian establishments on the street."}
{"text":"Okay, so I thought I wouldn't write reviews under 4 stars but having a meal this bad with questionable service compelled me. To start off, since they opened years ago, going into this place has been repelled by a general knowledge of comparative prices and quality better in nearby Chinatown; and a place I know that plainly does it better back in Victoria, BC. A review of this place, the Noodle Box, is soon to follow. 

At any rate, I was hungry and flying solo, and didn't feel like middle eastern, so this was the best bet. I ordered the shrimp with black bean sauce. It took them 15 minutes to give me my dish when there was no-one in the restaurant (looks like they were responding to pick-up orders as someone walked in from the street to pick up take out.) They have two woks running. I couldn't figure out why I was waiting.

So, it was to my utter surprise when I chopsticked into the noodles and found that they were undercooked. Add to this the fact that the vegetables were raw and their was no taste of black-bean ( or visual cue as to the presence of any sauce.) I was ravenous so I ate the meal. It's worth saying that it's a health option and they gave me water. Bottom line: I won't be returning. Too spendy. Not tasty."}
{"text":"Clean and tidy place. Decent food good value. Not spectacular but definitely would go back."}
{"text":"I don't know what it is about the Mozilla Toronto office, but it seems that we're always the saviour of otherwise-empty restaurants along Bloor West. I guess it's instinctual: if nobody else is in a restaurant, why would you go to it? (Call it the Sushi On Bloor effect: why else would people wait in line when literally next door there's an equally tasty, and empty, sushi restaurant?) Before we started going to Crystal Rolls, not far from Walk in Wok out, it was always empty. Now it's only often empty, but since we're generally a group of 4-8 people, once we sit down the place fills up.

I think Walk In Wok Out should be MoTo's next project. I've only been once, and that time resulted in a meal of tasty and spicy noodles. Others in my office have been occasionally, and say the same thing, but whenever we walk by, there's at most one customer in the restaurant. I think it's time we rectified that, because Wok In Walk Out is fast, tasty, and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"This place is kind of boring. I kind of enjoyed the \"woking out\" part most if I'm honest. 

It opened up just over a year ago but there never seems to be any customers. I think I know why !! Who wants to pay $10 plus tax for a stir fry when there are a zillion great nearby options for $5.99! 

The place is very clean but always empty. The menu features various kinds of rice, noodles, vegetables, proteins and sauces for customized stirfry and salads. 

The food is very tasty, I'll give it that (I had a stir-fry with peanut sauce) and seemed pretty healthy (not oily). For this reason I give it a 3, but I just hate sitting in an empty restaurant !"}
{"text":"Well not much to report that hasnt been stated. Nice decor, typically not busy. I do find myself a bit confused by the menu (the first time i ordered noodles+all veggies+chicken and was a bit appaled by the whopping $13 bill). But the deal is simply, pick your noodle (or go carbless with a medley of veg)+pick yoru protein+pick your sauce. its quick easy and quite tasty. i never leave feeling overly full but have been very satisfied on both of my last trips there. its a nice change up from the usual sushi fare along bloor and quickly becoming one of my post gym spots. Yet to try the salad so will likely update this review when i do. 

oh and the food tastes great."}
