{"text":"What an amazing place. My boyfriend and I were wanting some good sushi. Being from southern Cali we weren't sure how Phoenix would compare. Let me just say UniSushi was awesome. We were a little worried at first when we walked in...we weren't greeted like you are at most sushi restaurants...we were greeted with \"hola\", and the waitresses didn't speak English very well. The owner came over (his name was either Jesus or Jose) and asked if we had any questions, and if this was our first time there. After looking over the menu the owner came back and took our order. Let me just say the rolls were amazing. We had some kinda spicy tuna roll...it was VERY spice....my boyfriend loved it. The chef came over and brought us some homemade sushi salsa....boyfriend...loved it. The owner told us how he got into a sushi restaurant. If you haven't tried this place, I strongly recommend. We will definitely go back when in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Best sushi in town, awesome happy hour specials and THE best michelada. Good music and ambiance. Loved the uni roll Do yourself a favor and go"}
{"text":"My husband and i were looking for a light lunch close to Banner Estrella Hospital. Had the spicy udan noodle and tuna roll. Very fresh roll and good tasting. The soup was packed full of seafood spicy and very good. Waitress and sushi chef nice and helpful. Thanks for great lunch"}
{"text":"Excellent service. They have an unique style of foods. Especially their Latino Rolls. Very tasty and well managed. Will be coming more and more just from the wonderful service I received today."}
{"text":"As a previous Yelper stated, it is quite dark in the restaurant. The music was extremely loud. You have to practically yell to hear each other. I don't even know how many times I had to tell someone to repeat themselves. The food also took a ridiculously long time to come out. We ordered Gyoza, fries, and wings as apps and they took 45 minutes to come out. Note, everyone else in the restaurant (two other groups) had already received their orders when we were putting in our orders. Also, when I received my roll, the Bye Bye Roll, I expected the roll to be fully cooked as it stated that it was \"Baked,\" which is important because I'm pregnant. Not so! My cousin ordered a salmon roll and received a salmon skin. She also ordered Tempura Shrimp and received a tempera shrimp roll. Also, twice we received items that we had not ordered. Other than that, our waitress was friendly and food was decent."}
{"text":"I'm giving four stars because it took over 30 minutes to get our food  and there were only 10 people in the entire place  but, the food was awesome. We ordered the Vegas roll, the Lisa Lisa and the guacmachilito which were a bit pricey between $10-$15 a roll but, delicious. I would go back but, would take into consideration the wait time. We did take advantage of the groupon discount which helped a lot. Maybe it's a new spot and hopefully with time they will get faster back there, lol! Very delicious rolls-hot n fresh!"}
{"text":"So f*cking good. Best sushi and great service. The ladies that served us were super sweet. Highly recommend this place. The food does take a little while to come out but I'd rather eat something made fresh than something made fast. LOOOOOVED it."}
{"text":"As some other reviewers have mentioned, this place is notorious for their slow service. Friendly, but slow. When I went there was only two other people there, and it took me about half an hour to get food.   However, I mainly review based on flavor, and this place has a ton of it. I had the Dragon Roll, and it was amazing. Everything I had was really good."}
{"text":"Came here during business hours.. Doors are lockes and no sign. Out of business possibly?"}
{"text":"So tried a new restaurant last night, it was my worst experience somewhere so far. I had the teriyaki bowl and it was over done with more bell peppers than anything. Worst of it chicken was extremely hard to chew on. Felt like it didn't even have any sauce more like just old stale Grilled chicken with some burnt rice and day old veggies. Waitress did ask to see if we need anything. Lighting was horrible to where you have to take out a flashlight to read the menu and still told them it was not great and paid $30 for horrible food. Wish i didn't have to pay."}
{"text":"The sushi and sashimi was so fresh, but the service was pretty terrible.  I think it might have been the server's first day.  Still, will definitely be back next time I'm craving some sushi!  Maybe the service will match the taste and quality of the food."}
{"text":"Stopped in to try out the sushi before heading to a concert.   The restaurant was very dark when you walk in.   I had to use the rest room.  It was down a dark hall, and I couldn't find it without turning the flash light on my phone on.  Service was very slow. Took about 10 min to get waitress to come talk to us.  The place only had two other tables with customers.  The menu was hard to read and didn't have descriptions. The more I read the menu the more the place just seemed weird.  It was a mix of Mexican sushi.    The waitress didn't know anything about the menu when I asked her.  I ordered the egg rolls and they were ok.  The sauce it came from was just chili paste out of a jar.  The fried rice was the biggest portion size I've seen.  It wasn't very good.  It was very buttery tasting, lacked any vegetables, and wasn't fried.   I then ordered a couple of easy rolls you can get anywhere since I didn't have descriptions of the other rolls and the waitress couldn't tell me what was in them.  One was a California roll, the other was a Philly roll. The presentation was good when they were delivered, but they were the worst I've ever had.  Tasted like old fish and had a smell. The rice on the rolls had a weird texture to them.  I ate one piece each and that's all I could stomach. I just asked for the check.  The waitress didn't seem to care to ask why we hardly ate any of the food.   I won't be back and can't recommend it."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! The service, the food, the environment we're all excellent. The sushi was really fresh, they even customized my roll with jalapenos upon my request. I came by myself, I didn't mind that it's a little dark because the temp stays cooler. The music is a little loud, I can see how a group would have a hard time talking. But I'm sure they would turn the volume down if you asked. My service wasn't slow at all. Perfectly timed appetizer the entre."}
{"text":"Decided to come here since we had a Restaurant.com voucher. At first glance, the place seems rundown from the outside but it's better inside. The service was good and the waitresses were very nice. We ordered quite a bit to get a good feel for the place. Everything was decent. Fried rice was very peppery and the sushi rolls were just ok. I did try the carne asada roll and that was my absolute favorite! Great Japanese/Mexican remix."}
{"text":"My review is not in the food because I didn't have any. It is solely on my short experience at the place. First, it is a little hard to find because is in a strip mall, second, I am not sure if it's because I'm from NY but places that cover their windows with decals are always a bit sketchy to me. I walked in expecting an Asian restaurant. I was greeted by a Hispanic waitress (I can guess her nationality, but won't) we were not sure if we needed to sit ourselves or wait to be seated. There was a weird smell and the air was stale. They had a telenovela playing and very depressing music. Tables were sticky and the water on plants on table was dirty which made me wonder how the kitchen was. After we ordered the drinks, looked at my husband and walked right out. Maybe it was my imagination but I felt grossed out like I needed to shower right away.  Like instated, not sure how the food was but everything pointed to it not being good."}
{"text":"A really fun twist on sushi, which i luv in any form. I haf the jalapenos filled with spicy ahi, batter dipped and tempura fried. Really good. Also had the cucumber salad, excellent. My colleage had the avocado with ahi tempura style wbut it was toooooo much avocado (never thought you could have too much avocado!) And missed the mark."}
{"text":"I was sadly disappointed with the suhi here. We got a to-go order and they sad 10-15 minutes, we arrived and THEN they made our order. The sushi was room temperature. Ive had sushi on many occasions, and dont expect much. If youve never had sushi in your life, maybe you'll like it."}
{"text":"Worst sushi restaurant that I have ever been to. I wish I could give 0 stars. HORRIBLE service. We were the ONLY people sitting at a table in the restaurant and it took 30 minutes before they could bring our salads and soups out (by the way their version of a raw squid salad, is fried calamari on a garden salad, what?). They messed up every single one of our orders, or were completely unable to complete the orders at all. I made 1 simple request to have the shrimp removed from our rainbow roll, and they brought the roll out (45 minutes after ordering it) with shrimp on it! I'm HIGHLY allergic to shrimp. I told them to take the order off the bill. What do they do? Bring the roll back out with the shrimp picked off of it. Really? They then brought out our caterpillar roll, which is supposed to have eel in it, and it was a California roll with avocado on it. What?! While the sushi was being served (mind you we only had 4 people and we only had 2 total rolls served during the HOUR that we were there) our other friend who ordered the teriyaki chicken bowl, never even got her meal!! I told them to just forget about the other 3 rolls that we ordered because it would probably take another hour for them to even complete those. Worst service, mediocre sushi, NEVER going back. We were there on a weekend evening and the place was completely empty. Maybe we should have taken note of the red flags and avoided the place at all costs!!"}
{"text":"Well, before I start let me tell you the Atmosphere in there is horrible, music is way too loud to enjoy a conversation the place is a bit too dark for my taste and it seems that they tried too hard to make the place look Asian but they didn't come even close to the right look, now to the important part, I know sushi and this isn't it, i do not understand this Mexican sushi, now let me explain the flavor wasn't bad but it is not sushi, this place is way overpriced given that I saw the \"manager\" walking into the kitchen with food city bags, and that's never a good sign, we ordered a couple of rolls and a steak dinner, we'll let me tell you that was no steak we told the waitress (elena) which by the way was the best thing this \"restaurant\" had to offer, and she did everything in her power to make our experience better, but it just wasn't enough to change my mind about this place, the appetizer was decent (stuffed jalapeños) the roles weren't really that bad given that it it was happy hour and the were buy one get one half off, the beer was good (half price) I ordered some Nigiri and it wasn't available because according to the waitress their main clientele is Hispanic so they don't really serve anything else than deep fried roles, now I'm not Japanese, but my question is how is this place classified as a sushi restaurant, maybe an alternative sushi restaurant or something else, anyways I won't be going back, good luck to Elena, but management needs to step it up if they want to succeed, worst sushi restaurant I've ever been to."}
{"text":"I was driving through the area for lunch and needed something healthy and quick.  I happened to notice the Hikari Uni Sushi restaurant and was kind of surprised because it seemed out of character for the area.  This is a predominantly Latino area and normally you would not expect to find something with \"Uni\" (meaning \"sea urchin roe\" in Japanese) in the name of a restaurant.  That signified to me that the owner really knew something about sushi.  Usually the Sushi-Mex places don't.  So, with very few Yelp reviews to go off and intrigued by the name, I went in.    The place was empty and I thought it might be closed and there was a bit of a language barrier with the nice waitress.  Once seated, however, I ordered some tea, miso soup and roll.  The tea was piping hot and delicious.  The miso soup very good, too.  The roll was fairly reasonably priced and delicious - I think it was a Philly roll.  The gentlemen making the sushi turned out to be the owner and we got to talking.  He has worked as a sushi chef at many good sushi restaurants throughout Phoenix and brings this knowledge to his new restaurant.  He told me a beautiful new sign was on order and expected soon and that should raise the visibility of the venture.  Once he realized that I knew my sushi and we built a little rapport, he created a beautiful order of salmon nigiri sushi on the house.  VERY fresh and delicious with a nice sauce on top.  He told me he has a great fish supplier and it comes in fresh very often (Did he say \"daily\"?...well I can't remember now, but it is very fresh).  He said he can also order uni for me and that he is introducing the local area to what sushi is all about.  I wish them well.  The restaurant is very clean with a very modern and stylish design.  The bathrooms were clean and beautiful as well.  Lots of thought and care put into this place!  4.5 - 5 Stars for the Sushi, miso soup and tea 5 Stars for the hospitality and comping the salmon nigiri sushi 5 Stars for the decor and cleanliness of the restaurant 4 Stars for price (thought it was just a tad high)"}
{"text":"I initially wrote a very scathing review of this place, as I had a terrible experience.. let me put things into perspective.. the food is AMAZING... which is why I hated to write the really bad review the last time... it was the service that was so lacking. Anyway, fast forward several months.. I noticed an email from the owner's son Benjamin. The message was very courteous, mostly apologizing for my bad experience nothing out of the ordinary at first.... but It's what Benji did next that earned another shot. Benjamin went out of his way to give me his personal contact info, asking me to call him about my experience.. he then offered to treat me and my family to dinner at Uni Sushi, the right way. After some waffling back and forth with my fiancé, we decided to give Benji and Uni Sushi another shot.  I will tell you that the food was never an issue with this place, but even less of an issue this time. We had stuffed Tempura Jalapeño peppers as an appetizer, and were blown away by the flavor... spicy, sweet and completely unique... a nice fusion of latin and asian flavors.. next, we ordered several rolls of their specialty latin sushi.. carne asada, cielo mar y tierra, 3 amigos and then a vegas roll.. the staff and sushi chef never kept us waiting and we were constantly checked up on. The best feeling was knowing that my friends and family left happy... I will state again, the food was never a problem, in fact, probably some of the best sushi I have ever tasted... but I am glad that the service was better. Although I hate to be wrong, I have to admit that I was wrong when I said I wouldn't be back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Great prices, food is great, customer service is always on point and they play all major sports evens. I make the drive from North Phx to this place because of it. Highly recommended for your meal times..."}
{"text":"The service was excellent. The sushi was the best I've ever had. We've tried pretty much everything and it was perfect. My favorite  is the salmon teriyaki and they have the best Michelada (beer with lemon and tomato juice toped with shrimp). Would definitely recomend.  El servicio es excelente.  El sushi  es el mejor que he probado. Hemos probado casi todo en la carta y todo ha sido perfecto. Mi platillo  favorito es el teriyaki de salmon.  Preparan la mejor Michelada ( cerveza con limón, jugó  de tómate y camaron). 100% recomendable."}
{"text":"I have not eaten there BUT I know customers service is beyond belief. Live downtown we spend time on Westside found them on yelp rang because could not find menu. Jenny who answered sent me pics of menu and even responded to text messages. WHO DOES THAT! Thank you as you know we don't see that much. Look forward to eating there!"}
{"text":"This message is for the owner,  would you be willing to do some Uni on Wenday. I loved the service and the rolls last time.lets go for a round 2 buddy"}
{"text":"Went in yesterday for a couple of quick rolls and everything was surprisingly good. The exterior makes this place look very much like a hole in the wall, which I don't mind as some hole in the wall places are great, but the inside is neat and clean and everything looked nice. It's a good spot to pop in and grab some sushi."}
{"text":"My first time here and I am pleasantly impressed. Nice people who do a fresh take on sushi. Carne Asada sushi was a great surprise. Vegas Roll was perfect. Cielo, Mar y Terra is a blend of carne Asada, chicken, breaded shrimp, cucumber, avocado and cream cheese. Delicious! Three Amigos Roll is a fresh take on spicy salmon, ahi tuna, yellowtail, lemon, cucumber and spicy crab. Just try it. Don't think, just eat. Prices are a smidge more than usual but if you want to pay for creativity, you have come to the right place."}
