{"text":"What to say about Buns \"Master\" Bakery?

I knew we had made a mistake when the bread we brought to the counter landed with a THUD.  Upon further inspection, the bread was found to be ROCK HARD!

Thinking twice about our purchase, the helpful lady shouted: \"YOU TOUCHED IT, YOU BOUGHT IT!\". The smile on her face was proof that Buns \"Master\" Bakery had scammed another customer.

As my elderly mother had picked out the bread, and I did not want to embarrass her, I paid for the bread.  The cashier just smirked and said: \"Tell your friends!\"

Recently the strip club next door shut down, but don't worry, there is still a place on 843 Kipling where you can still get screwed!"}
{"text":"There are places in the city that I've discovered by accident, perhaps through my workday, or a random stop I made somewhere, that I've since \"kept in my back pocket\" and make certain to return to when I'm around.  

Buns Master on Kipling, just north of Queensway, is among them.  As a bakery, it's first rate, with bins and bins of freshly baked loaves and rolls and croissants of all varieties with that just-yanked freshness from the ovens you can clearly see behind the huge panes of glass.  Cookies, pies, and other treats await you from the shelves and coolers, as well as nifty things like breadbaskets to fill with your own chili or homecooked stew, or the hot-crossed buns you'll enjoy over tea on a spring morning. 

Several varieties of frozen Supreme-brand  pierogies wait to tempt you near the front door, including those esoteric (to me) sweet and desserty varieties like blueberry or cottage cheese.  Donuts, Jamaican patties, banana breads, stuffing crusts for your holiday turkey, and more yummies are available too.

But me, I usually go for the deli counter.  

Subway?  Mr. Sub?  Bah!  Instead of having to choose from some pre-planned, pre-sliced menu that they're going to serve me with some hoagie that's as airy as Wonderbread, Buns Master does what a proper deli should be doing.  

Go to a bin.  Take your pick of any loaf or roll you like.  If you're like me and want a larger sub, you then get to select between 'two meats and one cheese' from the sandwich counter, where your server will slice it fresh before you (rather than peel your choices away from waxpaper that's been sitting there since the front door became unlocked that morning... or earlier).

And I always leave with a smile.  ...That could be because the name reminds me of comic Margaret Cho's sketches about the \"Ass Master\" porn series.  But it could be because I think dessert pierogies are kinda weird.  I dunno yet."}
{"text":"Their assorted sub (already prepared and can be found in the fridge) is my fav sandwich. 

Their pizza meh. 

Their new jerk chicken sandwich is terrible. 

Their sausage rolls are always fresh, warm and not cheap on the meat."}
