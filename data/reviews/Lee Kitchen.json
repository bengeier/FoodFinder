{"text":"Waited 5 minutes to be seated, was told to seat ourselves. Waited 5 minutes to be greeted and get a menu. Stood up and got the menu myself. Waited 10 more minutes to have our order taken, nothing. Stood up and left. I'd rather fly on an empty stomach then try this place again."}
{"text":"Layover in Toronto and was hungry for Chinese. Was also curious to eat at a Susur Lee restaurant, having known him to be a celebrity chef with a few good restaurants to his name. But oh was I so sadly disappointed. Terrible service- inattentive and unapologetic for dirty chopsticks. Had to chase the staff for water, sharing plates and utensils. Food was extremely overpriced for what you got. $28 \"award-winning\" chicken curry tasted like a bad food court dish. Udon soup at $22 a bowl was the most overpriced and underwhelming bowl of noodles I've ever had. We weren't sure what to do but after deciding not to tip, the waiter laughed out loud when he took the receipt in his hands. This place should shut down and Susur Lee oughta be ashamed."}
{"text":"Stay away. From the food to the service, it was a thoroughly disappointing experience to put it mildly.   Service: I counted maybe 10 patrons at the restaurant and with two servers we waited over ten minutes for a menu and to order. This was just the start of the horrible service. When asking another server while ours was busy we received a rude, condescending response, bashing the other server in the process. When the food arrived our order was wrong and we ordered just two items. Lastly half the tables were still dirty and had half eaten meals still sitting around for the duration of our meal.   Food: Terribly average food. Yes if you're looking for dim sum at the airport it's a nice novelty but it's average dim sum at best and for something to have Susur Lee's name on it I expected much more. The grapes were unwashed and the potatoes underseasoned. I won't say it was overpriced because let's be honest what isn't at an airport, but for $7-9 a plate of dim sum a lot was left to be desired.   Overall, there are many other alternatives I would suggest you try. If you're in a rush to catch a flight don't even think about it. I'm surprised Susur let the quality of an establishment with his name on the line sink this low as this is a chance for international travelers to try his cuisine."}
{"text":"Good honest food and great service. Wasn't very busy in the resto on a Saturday at Pearson International gate. Had grilled cod with leak and potato creamy mash. The mash was warm not just quote hot enough, but the fish was hot and juicy with a perfect seasoning; delicious! I went with the Vanilla cake with melted chocolate, whipped cream and berry compote for dessert and it was just a perfect size to finish the meal. This is really the place to go eat if you have time before boarding your flight! I will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"Horrendous service: slow to take our order, lots of needless and tacky up selling, and incapable of giving us a bill in a timely manner: it's an airport restaurant! Food is OK but nothing like the real downtown restaurants.  If I were Susur, I'd be embarrassed. He should be."}
{"text":"Bad Pat Thai. Really awful taste. It was too salty and doesn't taste like any Thai I had before.   I am not exaggerating. I am not a picky person. I had so much Thai food in my life so I know what is good what is bad. I lived in the US for 8 yrs so I know what Americanized Thai food taste like. I had been to Thailand twice so i know what real Thai food is.  This is extremely disappointing.  However, manager and waiter have good attitude and cancelled my food order even I wanted to pay.   Good service, bad chef?"}
{"text":"As above. Stay away.  The servers must be angry or something. The person greeted us grunted and never even look at us (should've been the first hint)  Our server seems also only communicate in short, terse, angry words. I ordered 3 kids menu item that actually had 2 further options. Waiter didn't even blink. When i find out 5 minute later. He just told me he picked for me. It's like he couldn't even bother grunting me a heads up.    These guys seems to really hate working here.  It's pretty disappointing. The concept is good. Implementation.... I prob should've stuck with a burger. At least they wouldn't make me feel like Obama at Putin's house party."}
{"text":"Terrible service with average food. Staff not doing justice to Susur Lee brand. Will not go back."}
{"text":"A pleasant surprise at the airport.   I expected the typical successful brand interpreted badly at the airport by whatever factory produces airport meals .  I am a frequent dinner at Lee and Luckee downtown and I am happy to say to it is a very reasonable facsimile  Mark the bartender is an excellent brand ambassador for Lee he waa knowledgeable about the food and the other restaurants"}
{"text":"Funny how they called his restaurant one of the best airport restaurant, this restaurant 's food is so terrible, worst thing I ever eat in my entire life, I believe if u go out of airport and go to any Chinese dim sum restaurant, u ll get a much better taste and a cheaper price for dim sum, I didn't finish my food and I'm ready to go, I can't even eat more of those dim sum, taste so bad"}
{"text":"Instead of going into detail, I'll summarize my thoughts and let you read between the lines -  I should have just waited and ate on the plane."}
{"text":"Avoid this place unless you're out of alternative.  Long service. Super overpriced food, tiny portions and service is also very long.. You much better off the kiosks in front"}
{"text":"Need a quick bite before your flight? Then AVOID THIS PLACE LIKE THE PLAGUE.   Food is mediocre - standard overpriced airport disappointing stuff. I always eat here because it's dim sum and I'm an idiot.   Ask for your bill the moment they seat you and maaaaaaaybe you'll manage to make your flight departing in 3 hours."}
{"text":"I can only guess that Mr. Lee has never eaten here and if he has, his standards have fallen through the floor. Food was inedible, dim sum over cooked, fried food left a puddle of grease,  and the service was indifferent. Terrible value. Save your money."}
{"text":"I heard a lot of good things about the restaurant before so I finally decided to give it a try. It was the worst experience I ever had. The service was terrible. I asked for hot water when I ordee my food, 10 minuters later, the server brought me ice water. I asked for hot water again, 20 minuters later, still nothing. Finally I asked the third time, the server went to the washroom and never came back (Even when I was trying to pay at the end).   Secondly, the food was worse than food court quality. There was no flavor at all and the portion is so small.   I will never come back and definitely will not recommend anyone to come to this place."}
{"text":"Over-priced \"Chinese\" food, beef udon is $22 which tastes like $10 udon anyway else. Spring roll is good."}
{"text":"I had a quick layover in Toronto and I decided to check this place out. I have to admit that I had high expectations coming into it since I had just seen him on TV with Andrew Zimmerman.   I didn't have much time so I went with the beef wonton special. Service was polite and attentive despite being completely packed. Now on to the food. Ingredients were spectacular. Beef to melt in your mouth and juicy handmade wontons. I had to take a star away due to the bland broth which was very surprising but otherwise it was just what I needed to get through the hell of bad in flight meals"}
{"text":"As an asian and a fan of Susur's ( I watch a lot of food network television) I was hoping for much more flavourful fare from a restaurant bearing Susur's name. I understand that airport food is not amazing but the food I had at Rick Bayless' reataurant in Chicago O'hare was great.   The wonton noodle soup that I had was very bland although the shrimp wontons were tasty. I've made much better soup bases at home. The crispy spring rolls were mostly dough but the dipping mayo was spicy and good. My husband had the beef tacos and they were good but for a $20 plate the portion was tiny. He was still hungry. This was a disappointment especially since the Toronto Pearson international section had few proper restaurants."}
{"text":"Normally food at the airport in Toronto is very poor quality but this time I was pleasantly surprised with the food at Lee's Kitchen in terminal 1. I had some dim sum, specifically steamed dumplings which were very good and not too salty. This particular location was a Casey's until Susur Lee revamped the menu. It is not just Asian food but western comfort food with a slight Asian twist.  Definitely superior to average airport food."}
{"text":"At 11 am with few customers, service was slow. I had the dim sum sampler, half of which I enjoyed, but the sodium content is sky high. Six hours and several large glasses of water later, my mouth is still dry.  I did not add any condiments either!"}
{"text":"Service was bad, and it took kitchen 45 minute to make my Wonton Noodle soup.  At $22, It's is also way overpriced for the soup."}
{"text":"It's an American and dim sum restaurant.  Decor has a cafeteria feel, not really cozy.  There is a lounge side with tv screens.  Our omelettes were fine and came with all of the fixings.  They were probably the best deal for $15.  Other items were expensive.  Server was pleasant. Acoustics were tinny.  And retro music.  It was ok if you don't mind the cafeteria feel to the place.  Seats were hard plastic."}
{"text":"Don't get how people have given this place crap ratings. The food is probably the best food you can get in this terminal and worth the money.  First time I been here I think I had some sort of beef salad, I vaguely remember the mint and fresh taste of it. Was really good.  Recently I had there green curry. It seemed to be a fusion of Thai and Indian food, and honestly it was so freaking good. The portion of chicken was definitely filling.  Both times I have sat at the bar. Usually the quicker in/out option when there is a wait for tables."}
{"text":"Best food you will find in the E gates. I ordered a slow braised beef. It was delicious but pricey. Minus one star because of the long wait to be seated."}
{"text":"For being Dim sum place, you would think they would have edible dim sum.   You would be wrong.  Microwaved balls of low quality meat.  Lesson learned always yelp at airport."}
{"text":"We came here to grab a lunch, ordered noodle soups wand waited 30mins still no food. We have to go because flight is boarding. Just paid $40 for nothing. Do not visit if you don't have 1hr to spent!"}
{"text":"Very slow service. waited for 20' for a tiny bow of wonton soup. Still no meal until boarding."}
{"text":"Great Service! Bo did a wonderful  job going over the menu with me, and making me feel well taken care of after a long flight."}
{"text":"A very nice restaurant considering its in Pearson airport. The wait staff were attentive and prompt. Considering the meal was $22, I got a lot for my money. No complaints. One of the best vegetarian omelettes I've ever had."}
{"text":"I tried to find reasons to like this restaurant but after our brief experience there, it seems impossible. First we needed to ask for a table, once sitting, we were ready to order immediately as we had checked out the menu prior to coming in. They were quick to seat everyone else who came in, and since they were seating so many people, they were mixing up orders and giving other people who arrived after us the food which we ordered. They brought us fried wontons instead of the shiu mai and har gow we had ordered - after some investigation with the server, we were told that it was his first day. All good with us, we're easygoing people. It was only after we realized they served the same dish (which we had touched to inspect what it was) to the couple next to us as if they simply brought it to the wrong table. They brought the food over to them as if it was fresh out of the kitchen - this was EXTREMELY CONCERNING. Our food was not fresh and was clearly left to steam too long. They did not compensate in any way and we left with a bad taste in our mouth - literally and physically  I'm astounded that a restaurant advertising itself as a Susur Lee restaurant could be so HORRIBLE. Will certainly go out of my way to avoid eating here in the future as the experience, the food, the service, everything was well below satisfactory."}
{"text":"It was ok, nothing to rave over. The Kung pao chicken was alright but the mango smoothie had no mango flavour."}
{"text":"Pass.  Dumplings were mediocre and tasted like they simply steamed frozen ones.  To make things worse they don't even steam the different types separately so some come out fine and others way over cooked.  Service was poor.  Dumplings took about 30 minutes to come out and we only saw our server never checked on us between the long wait for food and after the food came until we asked for our check.  Don't come here if you're in a hurry because the servers and service is slow.  Drinks came out in dirty, oily glasses.    The restaurant was fairly empty when we arrived but somehow service was still terrible when at least 6 people were working the floor.    Prices were high for what you get.  Ambiance is hip but things felt dirty.  The floor had spills on it that were not cleaned up.    Bypass this place."}
{"text":"It is totally overpriced. I only ordered 2 dim sum and 1 wontons udon. I paid $46 for them and the foods are not good. Dim sum are really dry. The service is slow. I waited for 20 minuets for the food. Won't come again and not recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Over priced and noisy. The Asian salad was a disappointment with over cooked chicken on a skewer. Poor service on top . Over $40 with a beer"}
{"text":"Definitely the place to avoid at t1 international gate. Service was really bad. Servers just ignored customer. I was expecting the food could taste better than average Chinese restaurant food because of the name. I was totally wrong. The beef noodle taste much worse than $8 noodle from China town."}
{"text":"I was excited to see the Lee brand in the airport as I was traveling via terminal one at YYZ.  I've had great food at their main location and most of all I had incredible service.   I was hoping for something along the line and curbed my expectations given its airport fare.   But wtf batman, I wait at the front for a table the waiters don't say nothing and I ask if I can seat myself he points at a chair.  I sit. And I am sitting here.  And it's been over 7 minutes I have not been given a menu.  Waitress and waiter have gone passed me 3 times. Probably they could see the one star at the top of this review.    Even if I had the food now it would be tarnished by this experience.  Ugh."}
{"text":"1.5 stars: This place really capitalizes on sleepless travellers on layovers and the lack of other food options at the international terminal in Pearson airport.  My very low expectations were \"met\" and I unfortunately wasn't able to come away pleasantly surprised. I ordered the General Tao chicken which tasted on par with Chinese food court chicken except double the price ($19) and half the size. It was \"tasty\" in a food court way which I regretted once I boarded my flight.  Would only come back because it is here or the soggy panini place across from here."}
{"text":"We waited 10 minutes for a server, so we finally had to ask for our waitress, same story with the bill. Otherwise the food arrived quickly and was hot and delicious; I suggest the Dim Sum platter and the shrimp wontons--loved the sweet and spicy sauce with the wontons."}
{"text":"I'm veggie.    This place sucks.    Really nothing that fits as a vegetarian entree.   Salad or Veggie spring rolls.  Come on.  That's all you can do?   Waiter barks at us.  This is a thrill.   Argh.  (Turned out our waiter was also the barkeeper.).    So I decided to eat dessert.  Allow me to translate chef Susur Lee meant by \"banana blueberry cake with vanilla bean ice cream and salted caramel topping\".  He meant a very small banana-blueberry bran muffin, with a sprig of peppermint inserted in the peak, straddled by a scoop of melting vanilla ice cream, with 6 blueberries and some quite unsalted caramel sauce on a 12\" plate.   $12.     Airport food.   Eat before you come.   Eat on a plane.  This place blows.  How did they get 2.5 stars?"}
{"text":"Utterly horrible. I had a flight at 9:00 AM and decided to get break fast around 7:30 after I checked in. When I came in, the waiters ignored me for a full 5 minutes until one escorted me to my seat. I immediately decided to get their \"Classical Break fast\" but I was actually ignored by the waiters for another full 6-7 minutes but then I chose sausage and scrambled eggs. I sat and waited for 45 minutes until I asked where was my food. It came out 5 minutes later and it wasn't even my order. It had sunny side eggs and bacon instead, but I did not complain because my flight was already boarding. When I finished, I asked for the bill and it took the waiter another 7-8 minutes just to get it for me. I paid, and I didn't even get a receipt. I highly recommend no one go there especially if you're tight on time for your flight."}
{"text":"This rating is a reflection of the cost and taste of the food, and not a rating for the service staff.    Summary of this eatery (definitely not worthy of being called a restaurant), the food was both horrible tasting (extremely salty) and expensive. The added bonus I got was raw chicken which the kitchen claimed it was \"cooked\". A total waste of money!!!   Here's the long version. My dad and I were catching a long haul flight at Pearson, and saw this restaurant which seemed to be offering warm noodle soup and dim sum. I had mentally prepared for the authenticity of the place, however, the food was much worse than expected and was extremely expensive for what it is.   I had gotten the Pad Thai with chicken on the side (an extra $5). I had expected the chicken to be incorporated into the Pad thai, it instead came out as a skewer with 3 pieces (cold on the outside, and pink in the middle refer to photo) - not sure about you guys but that's not what I look for in chicken. I had complained about it, and was brought another skewer, and the waiter saying the kitchen checked the temperature of the chicken and said it was okay (really not sure what broken thermometer they used). On top of the raw chicken, the Pad thai was swimming in soy sauce. It was so salty but I was extremely hungry.  My dad had gotten a beef noodle soup with shrimp wonton noodles. Also very mediocre, but he doesn't complain as much as I do.  The total of the meal came to $60 with tip, NO drinks, just two horribly cooked meals.   Stay far away from this place if you can!!"}
{"text":"Lee Kitchen is located inside of the Toronto Pearson International Airport. The restaurant serves dim sum but it took 13 minutes to steam two dim sum orders. We ordered Chicken with Ginger and Scallion Buns and Steamed Beef Dumplings. The steamed buns had sweet egg yolks which made it more interesting. The Steamed Beef Dumplings resembles a shumai but filled with beef, chinese parsley, water chestnut, and English peas. These dim sum was served with soy sauce and sriracha. These weren't necessary as they were quite flavorful on their own. It was worth the wait."}
{"text":"Service was nice enough. My issue was the food. I'm shocked that a franchise like this could exist with Susur Lee's name associated with it.   I ordered the pork dumplings, and the chicken and peanut dumplings, the chicken and shrimp shumai, and the pork buns.  I was eager to love everything, but everything was severely under seasoned. Soy sauce was the dim sum's saving grace.  I found myself making excuses for the food but finally gave in by the time the fourth disappointing plate showed up to the sad, bland party.  For the price, I'd avoid this one."}
{"text":"Dim sum is delicious here, especially the steam beef dumpling! Better than any place I had in New Jersey!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the shrimp dumpling soup and pork bun while I waited for my flight.  Both foods were tasty. The service was nice and friendly.  I don't like eating airplane food and I'm so glad I didn't get ready-made food court foods.  I also enjoyed the hot green tea which was a nice green tea with a hint of passion fruit."}
{"text":"Thought i was gonna get some sweet dimsum before my flight. Jokes on me, for thinking i could get good food at the airport. I got the dimsum sampler, everything was over steamed and cracked from being over cooked. DONT BOTHER COMING IN just get some food from somewhere else. For $2.50 a piece you're getting ripped off."}
{"text":"Not very good.  It's in an airport, so I wasn't expecting much and while nothing was disgusting per se, for the prices they're charging I expected much better tasting food!  Pros -Nice, clean interior / design -Cleanly laid out menu -Service is acceptable  Cons -Hostess was surly (old white woman) -Very mediocre dim sum/borderline bad -Special Beef Udon soupbase was flavorless -High Prices  Upon arrival the hostess wasn't very welcoming. She apathetically waved us in and told us to \"sit anywhere.\" Wow, okay. Airport, breath.   Luckily, the server was better. He was pleasant and walked us through the menu and answered some questions honestly.   Shu Mai -chicken was a bit chewy  -overall want too bad -still probably one of the worst Shu Mai I've eaten  (including frozen)  Cha Siu Bao -on par w/ a combini/7 Eleven  -flavor was off  -pass on this  Har Gao -good compared to everything else here -very mediocre compared to even L.A.  Special Beef & Dumpling Udon -melt in your mouth beef -juicy shrimp dumplings -soup was flavorless like water  This place doesn't know what it wants to be. Instead of doing one thing (I.e. Dim sum) really well theyre trying to please everyone. This is probably one of the only dim sum restaurants that serves both bacon cheeseburgers and Indian Fusion. Or is it a burger joint that serves dim sum and Asian/Indian Fusion? Either way, just get a sandwich from Fetta or something. Waaaaaayyyyy cheaper and probably a lot more satisfying."}
{"text":"I ordered the Pad Thai as I was hungry during transfer. Tried to get them to add a bit of crushed hot peppers but they refused because they cannot change the \"standard recipe\". Instead they asked me to use the sriracha sauce in the table...that sauce has more salt that hot peppers  Their \"standard\" Pad Thai is...very mediocre...and quite saucy already...so with sriracha sauce it would've been even more salty.  Meh..."}
{"text":"Ordered breakfast for takeout before a morning flight. Omelette, Smoked salmon on a bagel and a yogurt parfait (for 3 of us), with 3 bottles of water. Pretty pricey at nearly $70, which was not unexpected given the main restaurant's reputation.  My Yogurt parfait was not as described - supposed to be fresh and dried fruit and a honey granola with Greek yogurt. Yogurt did not seem to be greek, and there was no granola. It was just a huge bowl of yogurt with dried fruit and some fresh berries on top. Not a parfait at all (should be layered). Very disappointing for the price.  Other food was OK according to my family, but I would expect much more for the money.   We enjoy Lee in downtown Toronto, so it is this location that is substandard.   I can't see this place lasting long if this is what they serve."}
{"text":"Service was just okay. We ordered shrimp shumai and chicken with ginger steam bun. It took 30 min. Not flavorful."}
{"text":"0 stars. We asked how long it'd take to get our food since we wanted to take it aboard the plane. The order took longer than the reported time. We then asked if it was possible to take what has been prepared to board the plane but the server/hostess made no effort to accommodate. We ended up forgoing the food to board our plane. This is our first time at this restaurant, and we had expected more based on the cost we paid (for food we never received). We are very disappointed. We will never visit this restaurant again and highly recommend avoiding this restaurant."}
{"text":"Personally, I'm transit, I'm looking for a good price/quality. This place has the advantage to have a real restaurant area where you can stand. The plates are generous and the team was serious in doing his job. 1000 Lee kitchen better than all the sandwich place without any interest."}
{"text":"If I can give 0 star, I would... It took them 30 minutes to prepare a breakfast and an assorted dim sum plate for me and my husband, tho there were only the two of us when we dined at Lee Kitchen.. Breakfast was really just cheap diner egg and toast, assorted dim sum is worst than what you can get frozen  from Asian supermarket and steam at home. Worst part was, half way through the dim sum dish, we found a long hair and we reported to our server right away. She took a look and said to us,\"so there's a hair, and you guys still ate the food!?\", we responded that we found it half way through . She repeated the same thing and looked at us in disbelief, and said that she can't give us refund because we ate the dish. Me and my husband were speechless and felt bad for chef Susur Lee, his face and name basically was trashed by people who just don't care about their job."}
{"text":"Was transiting via Pearson airport E gate, saw the noodle soup menu and decided to give it a try, the waitress was saying that is a  good choice. Waited for a while, it showed up as pictured, the first bite, immediately tells the story. The broth was taste less and the ingredient just went their own way, tasting what it should be. It was absolutely disappointing to pay so much money for a bowl of tasteless noodle soup! Will never again order this menu. Very disappointed, wish I can pay for what it's actually worth.  Definitely Not worth the $22!!"}
{"text":"Susur Lee's Kitchen ended up being a So-so Lee Kitchen...  While I enjoy the ambience, the atmosphere and (to  some extent) the meals at Fring's (Also co-owned by Susur Lee), the food and the portions at Lee Kitchen were abysmal to say the least..  I ordered the Shrimp Pad Thai with the strawberry mint lemonade while my mom ordered a vegetable spring roll combo.  The noodles for the Pad Thai were a little too sweetened and as a result, it  overpowered the overall  taste of the dish. Further, only 2-3 small pieces of shrimp were provided with too many nuts sprinkled on top. The Strawberry Mint lemonade was a little too minty for my taste, however my mom really enjoyed her mango smoothie!  That said, the options for vegetarian travellers are extremely limited (to 2 or 3 dishes MAX) and it was a little disappointing to not even be asked for dietary accommodations.   Lastly, the price for this place is off the charts, and definitely not worth for the portions you're being given. We (Party of 3) had a $120 voucher that we used for the meal (2 Pad Thai + 1 Veg Spring Roll + 3 Drinks which came about to $100+tax) but in retrospect, I think I would have realized better value using that at one of the many fast food chains combined with some gift items...  I like the hipster atmosphere, feel and ambience of the place, especially where I can directly see them making the dim sums so that was cool. The waiters were nice, but seemed really rushed (Maybe the airport atmosphere) Granted, I had a flight to catch in 35 minutes (and thankfully, I made it!!!)"}
{"text":"It was decent, it's a airport and we had s seven hour layover. Inflated prices for airport food but decent portion sizes. Pretentious, but they capitalize on offering something different then grab and go and your fast food burger."}
{"text":"Too bad there isn't a 0.5 star option.... We ordered the wonton soup and the \"award winning green curry\". Both were horrible and I wish I had just waited to eat on the plane....  Let's talk about the service first...  Walked in, waited 10 minutes before the waitress came to ask what we wanted to drink and she was very rude about it too... also was impatient. Waited 20 more minutes for food and not once did she come check on us. At end, when we asked to pay, she pretty much stared at me while I entered the tip amount and threw the receipt at me while my other friend paid her bill. Needless to say, she didn't get very much tip ...  Ok, now food... Wonton soup first - 3, yes... only 3 wontons floating in shallow \"broth\" and the worst part is.... the dish is completely cold (that's a $16 dish btw). Now to the award winning green curry... it's the worst curry I've ever tasted.... very deconstruct... and felt like throwing up after eating it..., the tomato purée was a mystery to me, not sure why he would ever add that to the dish because it overpowers everything...  Now to the bill, the two dishes costed me $50.... way overpriced and horrible food. Would not recommend at all"}
{"text":"I was early getting to the airport. I was getting hungry. It was lunchtime. I saw Lee Kitchen and decided to give it a shot.  I wanted to get the dim sum combo, which consisted of eight different items for $21. Yep, you can tell that this place has jacked-up prices. I was hungry, but was not at a gorging phase. Instead, I went with the Hong Kong fried rice and a Diet Coke.  The fried rice was okay. Frankly, it was too sweet for my taste. Since when is fried rice sweet in Hong Kong? Maybe I went to the wrong places when I was there years ago. Perhaps my mom, who makes excellent fried rice and grew up there, has been doing it wrong. Um, I'd say no on both counts.  Service was a bit sluggish, but I wasn't in a rush. I managed to have a leisurely lunch and had plenty of time to spare to board my flight.  I would like to try the dim sum platter next time, even though I would be breaking the bank again.  (126)"}
{"text":"The Fried Shrimp Wontons with sweet chilli sauce and Shrimp Dumplings were absolutely delicious; perfectly cooked, flavourful, and exceeded every expectation.   Service was lacklustre and inattentive, and the atmosphere is incredibly noisy with very few textiles to absorb sound in a space with high ceilings...but who cares when the dim sum is this tasty.   I look forward to having a pre-flight snack here again."}
{"text":"The food was good ordered wonton and beef udon noodle and the banana desert which was great. The service was horrible. It was hard getting the attention of the waitress even though they were just standing around."}
