{"text":"My wife and I eat out often and like to try one or two new places each week. This was the worst service we had experienced in years. The restaurant was not busy when we arrived. We asked to sit on the terrace and were told to go ahead and pick a table. About 5 minutes after sitting down, a busboy brought us water. We waited at least another ten minutes before the waiter showed up, and asked if we were ready to order. No one ever offered to take a drink order. We ordered a pizza and salad. The pizza was brought out by a \"runner\" who placed it on the table and left. That was the last time anyone came to our table, or any other table near us, for the next half hour, The waiter finally showed up and, noticing our empty plates, apologized for forgetting our salad. We asked for the bill, he brought it, and then disappeared again. Fifteen minutes later we left, leaving exact change in the folder. The pizza was okay, nothing special. Prices are a little high, but not unreasonable. There are many many better places for pizza and Italian food in Montreal. We will not return to Geppetto's."}
{"text":"Simple but delicious was my suitable and sufficient margarita pizza with crust that was crispy all the way through, and thick, sweet tomato sauce topped with very nice mozzarella.    Bruschetta was refreshingly fresh and flavourful, and my bresaola plate came with a nice heap of arugula.  Two of shared the pizza and three appetizer, which was a good amount of food.  I guess the third appetizer wasn't so remarkable as I really can't remember what it was... The dining experience was overall very pleasant - lovely atmosphere that is classy in an understated way but still casual.    Oh, and a fun Italian-centric cocktail menu with campari, citrus and prosecco as prominent ingredients."}
{"text":"Thanks to the wonderful folks at Trium, we came here for lunch today. Wow! The food was phenomenal! The spicy peppers on the side were a treat like I haven't had in years. Talk about hot !!! Then to top it all off, the dessert was deliciously decadent! A must visit and a double must if you can sit outside and enjoy people watching!"}
{"text":"Not one bad thing to say about this place !!! Went once had four dishes!!! The food was just SOOOO good !! Formidable !!! No words, just go try for yourselves !! Absolutely a must whether you're a local or from out of town !!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today with a group of work colleagues. I had the lasagne of the day which was super yummy, although it could have had a bit more meat in it. Others at the table reported that the soup of the day was excellent and the pizzas got rave reviews.   The service was a bit miserable and quite slow. We had to press for service rather than have it offered. That was even though the restaurant was only about 60% full.   Overall I would come back again because the food was good, but perhaps only when I'm not in a rush."}
{"text":"I love me some thin crust pizza! Geppetto is my go to pizza joint when I'm not in a hurry, I had the chorizo pizza and it was delicious, nice & spicy the way I like it. Most often then not a personal size pizza is not enough for me but I left the restaurant feeling satisfied with my meal. A must on my pizza are fresh pepper, spicy oil for the crust and pepper flakes which they had :-) My water stayed empty a little too long for my liking was the only negative point...I had to ask for a refill. For desert we shared a vanilla creme brûlée which was spot on! We will be back!"}
{"text":"My 3 kids said their margarita pizza was the best they've ever tried!  My husband and I enjoyed the grilled octopus and grilled chicken pasta. We will definitely coming back tomorrow :)"}
{"text":"Pizzas and food here are great!  I will come back again and again for the amazing octopus appetizer, and my picky dad swears the lasagna is the best he's ever had.  I love the variety of toppings, and the crust is fantastic.  Although the manager told me that there is a small amount of dairy in their pizza crust, I was able to eat a cheeseless pizza here multiple times with no issues. I have been a returning customer since I first went there last fall. Unlike some other yelpers I haven't had a bad service experience here; everyone has been friendly but I have learned to expect it will be on the slow side, especially in summer when the terrasse is open."}
{"text":"On habite le coin, et on aurait aimé avoir une bonne pizzeria de quartier, mais malheureusement à cause de la pizza pas tout à fait maîtrisée, on n'y retournera pas : pâte décevante, sauce industrielle..."}
{"text":"Dommage que le service soit si inégal parce que la pizza y est très bonne. Nous y sommes allés à trois ou quatre reprises et nous avons eu des problèmes récurrents avec nos commandes. Elles ont été oubliées une première fois. Puis, lors d'une autre visite, on nous a donné un plat de pâtes au lieu de la pizza commandée. Une commande pour emporter a aussi été extrêmement lente. Nous voyions nos pizzas refroidir sur le comptoir avant qu'elles ne nous soient remises.   Des bières nous ont été offertes, mais la récurrence de ces événements fait que nous n'y retourneront plus."}
{"text":"I hve been few time to this place with my family One of the best pizza and pasta in town very friendly staff. The Pizza is not too heavy so when you have it for diner you don't get too heavy :)"}
{"text":"Uh, Jessie Palmer was eating right next to us. No, that doesn't mean i'm impressed, nor does it mean that I'm a fan. I'm neither. But i do watch the Bachelor (ya, go ahead, judge me, i don't care) and was just hoping I would hear something juicy that I could share with friends with similar bad taste in tv. No such luck. He seemed totally vapid. OK...now the food!!  I had NO complaints with the food. We split an arugula salad that was large and mainly arugula (a good thing), the grilled octopus which was yummy albeit a tad chewy (hard to escape) and the marazinna pizza which was delicious although a bit too much ricotta. Overall the pizza had a great thin crust and we had a great evening.   My main issue lies with the waitress who had a BAD attitude. Never smiled once, seemed annoyed to have to ask what we wanted and took awhile with the bill. Maybe she was distracted by the overinflation level of her lips and chest...ooooh did i just go there!? Ya, i guess I did. That was low. I know. Sorry. But...whatever."}
{"text":"Made a reservation a week ago for a table of 4 on Saturday, and waited over 30 mins for a table. This place does not respect their reservations, rather you'll be seated based on your connections with the owner. Walk-ins without reservations were being seated before us, and when we complained about the wait the owner was extremely rude. We left immediately and will never go back. They need to learn customer service, because with their attitude their hype won't last!"}
{"text":"I got the risotto, my husband got the penne, and our two other guests got pizza. We should have gone with pizza!!!! The risotto was ok, not great, and not bad, same review for the penne, not amazing, but good. The pizzas however were great!!! Good crust, interesting selection of toppings! Will be coming back again for pizza!!!"}
{"text":"Best damn carbonara pasta I have ever had, and I've had more than my fair share in my day. Perfect combination of cream, cheese, pepper. Generous portion, excellent dish.  I also had the burrata on two separate occasions. Yes, the dish is $24, but if you understand the quality and sheer volume of ingredients that go into the dish, you'd be hard pressed to make it at home for less than $20."}
{"text":"Went to a food truck launch and ended up at Pizzeria Geppetto across the street with a friend !   This place is quite charming and the food is pretty good but the service was like we say in french ''Laisse à désirer'' which means could have been much better.  My first impression of the place was the decoration : intimate, cozy and romantic feel with vintage furniture and low lighting. I love many details, the fact that you could see a part of the kitchen from most tables is pretty cool and booth banquet seats are always a plus for me! Oh there is also a very nice patio outside for summer days/evening!   Now about the food ! The menu offered a variety of pasta and pizza dishes with some interesting entrees and a wine selection : Typical italian place or at least what most people would expect. I ordered a pizza called Americana which was a pretty standard with tomato sauce, green peppers, cheese, mild soppressata (type of salami which i abstained from) and Mushrooms - which was the main reason why i ordered it. The pizza was a pretty big size for one person but anyone can easily finish it because it didn't have that ''heavy-greasy'' feeling that most fast food pizza's have nowadays. The dough was the tastiest in my opinion, you could sense it was an oven wood pizza . My friend only took an entree, the grilled octopus which was served with chickpea puree - THAT was really delicious and i'm not usually a fan of sea food but i would go back to that place just for that one dish. A must try.  The thing that made me give it 3 starts instead of 4 was the general atmosphere of the place. It was so very busy, waiters were running right and left and it seemed to exist some type of disorganization. My friend and i arrived and waited behind 2 girls to be seated, they had a reservation and were seated after a few mins. After that we waited for about 10 mins at the entree before a man who worked there approached us to ask us if we had been previously approached, we told them no and specified we would like a seat for two and did not have a reservation. The man nodded and left and we waited....& waited....& waited all the while waiters were walking passed us without any acknowledgement. The man who previously spoke to us never came back and we had to stop a waiter in his tracks while he was rushing past us to ask once again if we could have a seat, he then told us finally YES and we were seated within 5 mins.  I would go back if ever i'm craving that grilled octopus or maybe just to give it one more chance. Overall this place has great potential but could really benefit from better service especially at the reception area."}
{"text":"I've eaten many pizzas at many pizzerias all over Montreal and the world. Sadly Gepetto was not at all memorable.  The ambiance is nicely decorated. The menu has a great variety of flavours and choices to please many palettes.   The service unfortunately was just \"OK\" Not terrible, however not much enthusiasm was shown when serving us, which was a table of two.   We decided to try two different pizzas. They do not bake pizzas with two different flavours. You have to order one per person. The portions are quite generous!!  We ordered the \"Margarita\" which is a basic tomato sauce, with a thin layer of cheese and fresh basil. Ours had two tiny leaves of basil. Quite stingy if you ask me! Our other pizzas was a cheese base with caramelized onions and bacon. The flavour combination was great! Very much on the salty side.. Too salty for my taste. The bacon was cooked to a nice crisp. The onions were nicely browned and caramelized. The cheese was very much salty with no flavour.   All this sounds delicious so far, right? Was was wrong? First and foremost it's far too thin! This was paper thin and very very soggy! You needed two hands to hold it so the pizza wouldn't fall apart. The crust was missing a great crunch factor and also quite soggy as well.   Overall, I tried it and I wouldn't go back. With a large variety of other wonderful restaurants in the area, Gipetto.. is not at all something I would recommend to others."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Geppetto twice now. Once out on the terrace and most recently I picked up a couple of pizzas to go. My first experience was neutral, the prices were a bit high for what you got but the food was ok, nothing memorable.   My most recent experience was more memorable, but unfortunately in a negative way. I called in my order, a Marguerita and a Funghi. I arrived to pick up the order, the restaurant was not too busy, and after waiting a couple of minutes at the front was directed over to the bar area to collect my pizzas. Throughout my interaction with the staff I got the impression that I was clearly some sort of inconvenience and that their evening would have been much better if I had chosen to order my food from somewhere else.   As for the pizzas they were bland and disappointing. There are a number of excellent Pizzeria's in Montreal that produce great thin crust pies so I will not be visiting Geppetto again."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza!! The crust is thin and crunchy and the toppings were fresh! The ambiance was great with jazzy background music and the service was attentive and courteous... I will definitely go there again!!!"}
{"text":"The pizza and pasta here are amazing. Very flavorful and plenty of meat in every dish. The brownie was delicious. The creme brulee was very ordinary though.   As for the service, it was a bit slow to get the food (or maybe we were just too hungry and every second seemed like 1h) and to get the bill.   Nice location, not too far from the metro."}
{"text":"Basilic frais, tomates cerises, proscuitto, roquette et généreuses boules de ricotta dulce, la pizza Mazzarina est la préférée de ses dames, selon le serveur."}
{"text":"One of the best pizza restaurants in montreal and service is A1!!! Terrasse is nice facing park - reasonably priced. I've been here a couple of times and it's always been a good. Deserts are supberb."}
{"text":"Je dois donner que 2 étoiles après ma 3e visite à ce restaurant tout près de chez moi pourtant alors bien triste. Point de vue emplacement (devant parc Molson) et décor c'est très bien. Or le service a été inégal ( on a eu droit à des beaux sourires mais aussi à des visage impatient) mais ce qui m'a le plus déçu est le goût. On a tous les 3 (avec mon père et mon frère) pris des pizzas et le goût était moyen, pâte brûlée et ingrédients qui goûtaient le réfrigéré, voire pas frais... Idem pour le pain sec et pas frais. Les escargots étaient également très moyens en entrée. Bref avec tous les bons choix de pizza fine dans les environs, je n'y retournerai pas... A moins d'entendre que des changements ont été apporter pour la fraîcheur et la cuisson"}
{"text":"I'm really not sure why the ratings are so low for this place, my friend and I walked in for lunch on a total whim since we were in the area. It was quiet and empty, except for a group of 4 sitting across from us. The restaurant is cozy and our waiter was really helpful.  They have a pretty vast variety of beverages. I had a glass of Italian Sangiovese wine, and for 8$ I was very satisfied and enjoyed it thoroughly. We shared an appetizer of grilled octopus (14$), which was phenomenal. It was by no means chewy or rubbery; it was rich in fresh flavour, very soft and tender, and served over some delicious hummus and a side of chickpeas. The dressing was simple: lemon-y and some garlic. Nothing overpowering, it was just right. Following our appetizer was their special of the day: A small (but not actually small) pizza and side salad for 15$. The pizza had been made with pancetta, arugula, and feta- really fresh ingredients that blended well together. I loved it.   Empty or not, I'd come again."}
{"text":"The food was OK i took the crevette pasta (was too spicy for me) and the chicken lasagna ( was good )  the service was slow and not friendly."}
{"text":"Went there while visiting Montreal.  It's not on the main drag (by Atwater Marche & the Canal), but that's it's charm -- it feels like a cute neighborhood place.  Very solid pizza  right from the oven.  One of the best places we ate while in town.  There are a lot of over-priced food places in Montreal, but this place is worth the 50 bucks we shelled out for two pizza and two drinks."}
{"text":"We loved this little restaurant. Service was okay, but their amazing tomato spaghetti pasta made it all okay. So far, this is the best tomato pasta I have tried. My boyfriend and I were going nuts on the sauce - just saying if you are into those kinds of things! Pizza was good, crust was thin and well baked. Toppings were fresh. I'll have to go again and try another flavour (my boyfriend ordered one I wasn't crazy about but he was :) ). Their wine is good too, so it was a nice addition to this meal. For my Italian cravings, I'll know where to go!"}
{"text":"Sat at outside. So can't review the inside of the restaurant. The service is good. The food was good but nothing extraordinary. If you are nearby, every restaurant around you is full, this one is a good grab."}
{"text":"Tried their pizza and pasta.  Pizza: thin crust, many choices of toppings, however, not much on top of the pizza. They have their \"house spicy oil\" that adds some flavour! Was not disappointed, but a bit expensive for a pizza...  Pasta: had the linguini with merguez. The sauce was very heavy and creamy. Couldn't finish it as I can almost see a layer of oil at the bottom of my dish. The merguez tasted good."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times and I love it. I've had pizza, salad, and the lasagna and all were amazing. I've eaten inside but the tables are pretty close so I preferred eating outside.   The only reason I don't go here more often is cause it's a little on the expensive side."}
{"text":"I ordered the pancetta pizza with ricotta and my husband ordered the four cheese. Decent portions and the pizza has a good thin crust."}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to give this place a try the other day. The inside of the resto is nice and had a rustic feel to it. The waiters were very kind and helpful with their suggestions. We ordered the 12 inch pizzas. My pizza was good but I felt it was lacking something. The waiter brought over some spicy sauce, which actually made it better for me. (Sidenote: that sauce is quite spicy for those who have a low spice tolerance). For dessert I had the tiramisu, which I enjoyed more than the pizza. The resto is quite expensive. Overall, good experience."}
{"text":"Enjoyed spending time with friends over some great pizza, wine and beer.  I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I'm sad to give this place only 3 stars because the food is very good, however, the service isn't as good. My Margherita pizza was amazing and all my friends got pizza as well and seemed to like their pizza just as much. I also tried my friend's tomato mushroom soup which was very tasty. As for the service, when we arrived we weren't greeted by anybody and we had reservations so we had no idea where to go. We were told to go speak to this one girl who told us to wait. Once we got seated, our waitress, this girl with short hair, didn't smile and wasn't very helpful. She seemed as if she was annoyed of us and it wasn't very welcoming. It did not stop us from having a good time though. At the end, she messed up our bills which was kind of annoying but she did oddly seem in a better mood at that point. Anyways, it was a nice birthday dinner needless to say it's just sad that the service was so poor. Many of my friends said they wouldn't return but I believe in second chances so I will be back because the food was so good."}
{"text":"Les pizza avait l'air délicieuse on étais on groupe de 12.. les entrés étais très bonne mais les pizza étais soie trop salé ou pas assez de goût plutôt fade genre pizza pesto et celle à sauce blanche qui son supposé débordé de saveur tk c'est la 3 iem fois que j'y vais je ne prendrais plus de pizza.. pour les pâtes jamais je ne payerais pour un bol de spag à 20$ mais ça c'est moi."}
{"text":"Nous avons organisé un party de Noël avec la collaboration du propriétaire. C'était vraiment super! C'était sous la thématique d'un cocktail dînatoire. Les entrées étaient vraiment délicieuses et nous n'avons en aucun cas manqué de nourriture. Que dire de la pizza. À essayer assurément!"}
{"text":"Was it that I thought it was pricy? Tucked away in a corner? to be honest, I'm not even sure why I haven't taken the time out to eat here prior to this visit but, I sure glad I did.   Another interesting thing was that we headed in at about 830pm on a Tuesday, and the place was pretty busy still (people were coming in after us too AND it closed at 10)!   So first things first: Ambience - This place is felt very warm, and I don't just mean sitting in an open pizza kitchen warm, but the decor and photos, and mirrors, it was totally cute. Secondly, there were a mix of crowds there, I saw  4 couples, a couple of families, girls dinner, guys dinner, among the mix of people, and of all ages.  There was 3 of us I ordered and split the Veggie Pizza with Goat Cheese, my 3rd friend the 4 cheese pizza, and we all shared the Grilled Octopus.  I watched my friend Anna inhale her half of pizza and it was good but the highlight has to be the Grilled Octopus! It was so delicious!!! Not chewy, perfect in taste, and the Chick Pea (not even sure what it was exactly but was like hummus but even better) Salad, Dip(?) that came with it was so tasty!  The only thing it was missing was bread to go with it.  Service was good, nothing that caught my eye superior or bad and I waffled on giving this place a 5 star because of price. Prices were just a notch above reasonable but I felt satisfied with my meal, It won't be my go-to neighbourhood resto unless Im feeling a bit more spendy! Just to give you an idea of price: 2 pizzas 1 entrée = $21 per Person with tax and tip, no beverages."}
{"text":"I've been here for the first time and we chose the place just because the other one, for which we came, was closed. We were served by 3 persons, the one who welcome us, another one who gave us some tap water (which I find an extremely bad habbit for a good restaurant)and the waiter who served the food. A very good menu, the food was delicious, well seasoned and fresh. The Meat Lover pizza was too salty for the, but the one with kales was great. The grilled octopus, served with humus was perfect, not too dry, and we loved the crostiny of the day. We also took some wine from Toscana and the bill was around 100 CAD without tips. I would certainly come back there to try their desserts. A nice place for italian food lovers, that deserves to be on the map of Montreal."}
{"text":"Went there on a busy Saturday.  Pizza was good (except one that was a little burned). Service was ok.   Too  long to get our main dishes (4 pizzas): 75 minutes. But could be due to a big group present at the same time.   Salad was ordinary (but arrived quickly).   Dessert took a little too long as well and was ok (crème brûlée which was OK). However they offered the desert to make up for the long wait time."}
{"text":"Food was great but the service terrible! Over one hour between the starters and the pizza. And our waitress couldn't care less. Won't be going back for sure!"}
{"text":"Overpriced and not as good as they think they are, based on lots of attitude. The place was packed so clearly it's popular. My arrabiatta was surprisingly ordinary, compared to others, and at $20 or $21 ridiculously overpriced. It was also not hot by far, considering the price.  I asked for it to be reheated. Still only fairly hot. Owner (or manager) had attitude to spare, unwarranted. My older aunt had spaghetti and meat sauce, her staple everywhere.  She, too, said it wasn't as good as even her neighborhood place, and twice the price. My cousin loved her pizza. Not impressed."}
{"text":"Food was great but the waitress was beyond miserable. She had a sour puss face forgot 2 of our drink orders and one person had to even go to the bar to get his wine!! Dessert took 20 min for the menu and another 20 to receive it."}
{"text":"Cozy and friendly pizzeria on Notre Dame Av. Good for groups as well. Big selection of pizzas and pasta to accommodate and satisfy everyone's taste and and preference. The service was really good and the pizza were served really fast (oven wood). However i found the pizzas (prosciutto and chorizo) quite average taste-wise, both of them had portions of the crust and dough burnt. The deserts were good and generous."}
{"text":"Réservé  Charmant, service impeccable et courtois. Arrivé sans réservation, on nous a fait attendre au bar avant d'avoir rapidement une place. Petit conseil si vous y aller en groupe, faite une reservation. Le menu est varié  et on ne parle pas ici de pizza \"toute garnie\", le choix est si grand que on ne sait pas quoi prendre. Les entrées sont un incontournable (à partager) à découvrir. Bref, belle petite place qui aurait passé inaperçue si on ne m'en avait pas parler."}
{"text":"Place was busy outside and empty inside. Not many people for lunch. But staff was not in a hurry and in total we waited for pizza 40 min. For start we ordered octopus- i do not suggest to order it cause it is not fresh and 100% preheated from the microwave, taste also so so. Pizza was OK, one was under salted underspiced - generally talking no taste at all if i don't add more salt and pepper. Chicken in pizza was totally no taste - to any spices. In generally pizza was not so bad. size was good, crispy dough. Second pizza it is last in pizza menu i do not remember the name but it goes with chorizo ,  onion and etc,,,, it is crazy fat pizza...omg our stomaccks were dead after it..... Coffeee latte was nice i liked it. Lemonade for 3 dollars they bring usual San Peligrino from bottle. Thank you"}
{"text":"It was very loud so we had to scream to hear each other. The Pizza and pasta came cold. I didn't care for the escargot. It was served in a oval bowl with a lot of a Dijon based sauce which I didn't care for. It was hard to find the escargot swimming in the bowl. I was disappointed because several of my friends spoke well of this place."}
{"text":"I don't know want to say, it is wonderful place! The pizzas are amazing and don't make me start on the pasta, they are speechless good, especially the pesto and prosciutto. We always had a good service, sometimes in the summer it is full and you have to wait if you didn't make a reservation but except that go there as fast as you can! It is a perfect place for a cozy romantic dinner with your significant other."}
{"text":"Fan fini. J'adore le branding et j'apporte autant d'amis que je le peux :)"}
{"text":"A friend of mine suggested this restaurant on a Friday, since we were around the area. We showed up there, summer 2016, and it was full packed since we had no reservation.  I really wanted to try it so we came back with a reservation this time.  We tried their special, 49$ for 2 items from the menu (it was from a selection of 6 items I believe) and a bottle of wine. I ordered seafood pasta, and my husband had pizza, and we both really liked our meal. The bottle of wine was a white biologic one and we really liked it (never had biologic wine before).  The waiter was very nice.  I recommend to reserve in advance . We are going back this coming week-end !! :D"}
{"text":"i nice little discovery! so glad i tried the pizza but the pasta on the menu looked good too! the place is really cute, the ambiance nice...and the service was perfect! i will for sure return. i had the pizza+prociutto+ricotta+basil and arugula...i kept thinking how amazing it could have been with burata instead of ricotta but the ricotta did not displease!"}
{"text":"This branch of Geppetto was started by the same owners of the Notre Dame St. location.  This new location is right on Beaubien and Iberville and used to be Boite a Tomates (another pizza place).  The service was good and prices are in line with other pizzerias in the city.  I started with a minestrone soup which was pretty good.  They added croutons to the soup which was different but a nice touch.  To top it off I had the pizza salsiccia which had sausage and rapini.  It was pretty good but super salty which was because of the sausages.  My one complaint was the noise.  I hate having to scream across the table to my dining companion in a restaurant and that's exactly what I had to do here.   There was a private event going on which featured a live band so that did play a role but even before they started playing it was too loud.  I would give the place another shot though because I did like the food quite a bit."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant twice. I left disappointed both times and decided to never step a foot there again. There are so many good pizza spots in Montreal and this one just doesn't make the cut for me.   I tried out 3 different pizzas and 2 different pastas. All of these plates where tasteless and badly executed in my opinion. The pizzas are never cooked properly and will often be soggy and soft in the middle, which makes it super hard to eat and not so tasty either. The restaurant is packed every night and the service is extremely slow. The waiters I had last time I was there was super condescending to me when I mentioned I didn't understand why my Caesar salad came in 20 min after the entres (lol). The carbonara pasta is mediocre and the bolognese sauce tastes like something that would come out of a can.   Sooooo yeah. Just save yourself the disappointment."}
{"text":"Thin crust Neapolitan pizza is definitely en vogue these days, and for good reason. Flavourful and healthier than traditional \"American\" pizza, it's a good fit for many occasions.  We were looking for a place to eat about the recording of La Soirée est encore jeune at Bar chez Roger. It was cold outside, and this place was 3 corners away, with a table available for us despite no prior reservation. Perfect.  The service was great. No complaints there.  The pizza wasn't bad, but it was not memorable either. I had the Salciccia (Lamb sausage, rapini, confit tomatoes and mozzarella). My girlfriend took the Genoa (Pesto, pine nuts, Kalamata olives, sun-dried tomatoes, fontina and parmesan). Both were lacking some brightness to make them spectacular.  Would I come back? Maybe, but most likely I would try something else instead in the area."}
{"text":"J'aurai tellement voulu donner une meilleure cote à ce charmant resto italien de la Petite Bourgogne. Dès que j'y suis entrée, j'ai adoré le décor à la fois intime et romantique, mais aussi relaxe et décontracté. Avoir une vue sur le gros four à pizza à partir de presque n'importe quel siège du resto donne même l'impression d'être assit sur le bord d'un feu de foyer. Puis le menu! Rempli d'ingrédients frais avec des combinaisons classiques, puis d'autres beaucoup plus imaginatives. Un pain na-an avec du saumon fumé, des concombres et une sauce blanche? Oh que oui! Une pizza blanche aux champignons et truffes? Bien sûr! Un ragoût d'escargots et de rapinis. Miam! La nourriture a été aussi bonne qu'elle en donnait l'impression et j'ai adoré le concept du menu régulier ajouté au menu du jour qui est affiché sur un grand tableau noir. J'ai aussi trouvé les prix très raisonnables.  À ce point là, vous vous demandez probablement pourquoi je fais ma difficile et je ne donne pas plus d'étoiles que ça. Il y a deux choses qui m'ont achalées pendant la soirée, et elles sont importantes.  1) La mosus de télévision. Elle ne fait pas de sens dans ce genre de resto. Tout le monde y était en couple ou en groupe d'amis pour un souper agrémenté de belles conversations. Ça n'était même pas un soir de hockey, donc on y jouait des émissions du \"Food Chanel\" sans le son. Si la télé avait été fermée, je ne l'aurais probablement même pas remarquée et le resto aurait eu une étoile de plus.  2) Le service était extrêmement lent plus le repas avançait. Nos desserts étaient terminés, nos verres d'eaux vides depuis au moins 20 minutes (il a aussi fallu qu'on demande pour nos remplissages tout au long du souper même si une personne avait l'air d'y être dédié sans n'avoir à servir de table), puis on a dû demandé pour la facture à 2 reprises car on nous avait oublié. Et il y a même une fois ou le serveur m'a clairement vu lui faire un signe parce que je voulais demander la facture mais il s'est retourné pour aller derrière le bar jaser avec d'autres serveurs. Pas fort.  Donc, si on fermait la télé et que le service avait été plus attentif et rapide, surtout vers la fin du repas, cette place se serait méritée un 4 étoiles au moins (peut-être même 5). J'espère y retourner quand même parce que j'ai aimé la nourriture, mais j'espère y avoir un meilleur service pour leur donner une autre étoile qu'ils pourraient facilement se mériter. Tout ce que je voulais, c'était les payer pour continuer ma soirée mais on dirait qu'ils ne voulaient pas de mon argent! Étrange..."}
{"text":"Went there with some friends. We had really nice time here. The pizzas had nice taste. And the service was also good.  I would try something special so I took the 'Salsiccia' pizza which with lamb sausages. It was really tasty but next day I was really sick, I thought I had food poisoning... Others were eating 'Quattro Formaggi'. They were fine. Maybe I was unlucky but after all my personal opinion is 2*."}
