{"text":"This place is not a coffee shop. It's basically a small filipino restaurant, that is known for their \"Batchoy\" noodle soup. But they serve all types of dishes as well. It's those type of places you go just to eat, not a place you would relax and enjoy the atmosphere, definitely not fancy.

I didn't know anything about Batchoy until a friend brought me here. Japanese have Ramen, Vietnamese have Pho and Filipino's have Batchoy. I really like it, the soup broth is very good, they use egg noodles,different pork meats, garnished with green onions and fried garlic adds to the flavor.  The serving should be just right to filling."}
{"text":"Better than FV Foods, that's for sure! Try their Special Bachoy, delish and the other dishes too. Friendly owner and staff."}
{"text":"Great food, Great Service. All dishes were delicious. My wife and I love the Kare Kare amd Dinuguan. Their batchoy is to try for and you wont regret it. For sure you will ask for more."}
{"text":"My third update, this place deserves more exposure but I feel like if they do, they will lose their charm of being very generous with their portions and just being plain nice. Their selection with their entrees are always amazing. I swear, I think the secret ingredient they have in their food is CRACK. Definitely will keep coming back for more ;)"}
{"text":"We were looking for a new Filipino food spot so gave this a go. There's turoturo  (hot table of already prepared dishes) but we chose a the breakfast dishes instead. We got the longsilog and the bangsilog with a side of lumpia. The eggs are made to order and they reheat the rest of the dishes. Plus side: everything was warm; they gave a side of onions and tomatoes; garlic rice galore; you can take the dipping sauces to your table sawsaw  (dip) all you want!; they have a calimansi (canned) drink!

The meal was very satisfying and cost for the 2 of us was $23. We'll go back and try their soup specialties when it gets cold outside!"}
{"text":"First time in this place last weekend and we've tried the Bachoy.  Too much fat in it.  The pork was not even cut for commercial consumption.  It seems that the meat was just bought from stratch in the chinese supermarkets.   We did not finish what we have and after eating while driving we still feel the greasiness in our mouth from what we have just eaten.  The 2 stars rating here is for the service.  They are very accomodating and friendly.  We'll not going back...sorry."}
{"text":"After such a long time..i brought my family back here to eat goto (rice porridge) and tokwa't baboy and lastly, the famous tapsilog filipino breakfast.  

the goto and tokwa't baboy was good but the tapsilog we found a strand of hair mixed in the garlic rice, we told the server and apologize and replaced it with a new one.

Brought the tapsilog home for my family to eat at home only to have found another strand of hair in the garlic rice. 

I'm so disappointed at the quality of the food. 

I will not return and will not recommend for anyone to go to this place since the quality of the food has gone down below zero."}
{"text":"Best Filipino food you can get in Toronto!! This restaurant brings you back to the homeland with their creative variety of food. From their delicious breakfast fried eggs, longanisa, and rice to their famous Batchoy ramen soup you cannot go wrong with this food. This restaurant gave me a full experience of the Filipino culture."}
{"text":"Amazing cheap eats here! The pork skewers are so heavy that the skewer starts to bend if you start with the skewer meat side down and then try to turn it right side up. They're also $3. Rice and one hot plate item is $5.99. It comes in a big square takeout box with two sections for meat/veg options, and they fill BOTH with the item of your choice. If you order the option with rice and two hot plate options, it's the same box with both sections filled with one of the two items, and then they get you a second round takeout soup container and fill it with your second option. It's big enough for two meals. Their kare kare was pork and tripe, not ox tail, but still full of peanut butter goodness and assorted veggies. 

Love it here. There are so many choices I need to try! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"had aroz caldo today was very filling .. my brother had Mongo and it was very good as usual"}
{"text":"I love coming to this unpretentious place. At any given time, they would have 2-3 hot soup varieties  warming in their huge crockpots aside from their special order specialty soups like Batchoy, Lomi, etc. They serve huge Filipino breakfasts. Their takeout portions are the most generous of all Filipino joints. The servers are friendly and there  is always a constant lively banter between the kitchen and the servers which draws you in, and  oh someone constantly mopping the floors. Sure , the place and d√©cor  could use some updating including their name, which could draw more Filipinos in (Batchoy would do the trick ), but  let's keep this Scarborough gem a secret for a bit longer..."}
{"text":"Monday morning and I've got a craving for a Filipino breakfast. Thank God for Coffee In because they are the only ones open in the area, the other Filipino eateries are closed booo! We sat in the car in front of the restaurant waiting for it to open and lo and behold they opened right on time (not Filipino time meaning late). The server/cashier held the door open for us and greeted us warmly. 

We ordered Tapsilog (Tapa, which in this case is beef that's cured then dried then fried accompanied with 2 eggs and garlic fried rice) and Longsilog (Longanisa which is a sausage made from ground pork accompanied with 2 eggs and garlic fried rice) and pork belly on the side. The meals came with a side of tomatoes and onions seasoned with fish sauce. They had a yummy spicy vinegar that went well with the meats. 

A Filipino version of a greasy spoon, food that's filling that will definitely put you in a food coma."}
{"text":"Great homestyle filipino food! The soups are just amazing... Huge servings!

Don't be fooled by the name - it's basically a filipino eatery. I think they serve coffee (but I'm not 100% on this). 

My fave was the batchoy!"}
{"text":"La Paz Batchoy is the best! It's super tasty. Will definitely come back to try their tapsilog. I only gave 4 stars because the place need updating, brighter lights and they need to clean it up."}
{"text":"Great place for tapsilogs, longsilogs and all the goodsilogs you can think of under the heat of Filipino breakfast for champs.

Small eateries like this remind me of restaurants back home that offer little ambiance but heavy on flavor. 

Couples dating over a year, prolly getting used to farting in front of each other and comfortable enough to head to this humble place in sweats and running shoes to chow down on some awesome authentic pinoy grub is on route to a long lasting relationship.
Results may vary."}
{"text":"Keep this place a secret!

This is such a low key Filipino restaurant in a plaza corner by Birchmount and Lawrence. I often come here and I am really thankful to discover this restaurant through the recommendation of a friend.

This is very ideal for my boyfriend and I when we come from a nightshift because the breakfast deals start at 7AM!

Their best seller is the Tapsilog! Yuuum!
I never had Tapsilog in my life, not even when I was in my motherland! Tapsilog consists of tapa, 2 eggs, onions, and fried rice. Portion size is huge and the meal will definitely keep you full for 6-7 hours. 

Pair it up with a warm cup of coffee and you are all set for an adventurous day!

They also offer a LOT of filipino dishes ie. Bbq, spring rolls, fish, pork dishes, etc.

You guys have to see it yourself by paying the store a visit!

The restaurant has around 9 tables that can seat 4 people per table. Enough to accommodate the morning rush of hungry people! 

If the staff know you well, they could offer you free tasters in full bowl sizes! This place is so generous thats why they are so blessed with customers and excellent business!

Keep it up Coffee In crew! More luck to all of you :)"}
{"text":"I come here whenever I am craving for authentic batchoy.  The broth is so full of flavour, and loaded with pork, liver and chicharon bits, just the way I like it.  It is wonderful to eat piping hot with some of the Ilonggo puto or Spanish bread. My favorite Pinoy treat in the GTA, for sure!"}
{"text":"Definitely the place to be to have filipino Batchoy. Good portion, good flavour and fast service!!"}
