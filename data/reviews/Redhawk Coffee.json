{"text":"Cool little place, nice atmosphere and staff. Great coffee too, go check em out!"}
{"text":"A nice cappucino with beautiful design. Breakfast food selection is limited with just croissants or strudel. Seating is limited with a few chairs and stools for the location. The chairs they do have are nice. Staff was very friendly. The aesthetic is rustic with distressed wood and ceramic tub to place used dishes in. A nice place to pop in for a few."}
{"text":"My office is right next door. Our entire office loves coming down for an early morning or mid afternoon drink. Great service and friendly staff. I prefer black coffee - and this is some of the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Redhawk is easily the best coffee in Oakland. You'll be hard-pressed to find better coffee in Pittsburgh.

They source their beans from a wide variety of roasters. You can't get most of their beans elsewhere in PGH. They're the only shop in PGH to carry Four Barrel coffee.

The baristas are incredibly patient and kind. They're very willing to patiently explain the menu and offer recommendations. Don't be afraid to ask dumb questions here. At the time of writing, I believe both baristas are co-owners (could be wrong). They're both remarkably knowledgeable - be excited to learn from them!

The shop has pleasant ambience, very comfortable chairs, ample natural light. The pastries are incredible.

Redhawk represents the best of small businesses in Pittsburgh. I encourage everyone to stop by!"}
{"text":"Went to this pace for a nice beverage before heading over to Hillman Library. The owner of the restaurant was very polite and the shop itself had a nice small town atmosphere. I ordered a regular latte and it was absolutely delicious. An awesome perk about this place is that they do latte art! 

The only thing I wished they had was some sort of rewards system, but this place is very new so they may come up with one later. 

However great coffee and I will be back without a doubt!"}
{"text":"Tiny coffee house, but outstanding coffee and service. I got a cappuccino. While it was not super hot, it was thick and delicious. 

There are three tables and an additional row of bar chairs on a wall counter. Many people were taking their coffee to go, but you can easily sit, if you want to hang out."}
{"text":"Now the excellent coffee choice in Oakland. Friendly staff, attention to detail, delicious. I like the use of local whole chocolate milk for the mocha. Your to-go cup gets a classy stamp when you order. Will be returning."}
{"text":"To put it plain and simple, best cappuccino I've had in the US! I'm visiting Pittsburgh from the Bay area on my way to moving back to Amsterdam, where I come from. I've had a lot of coffee in many different places and the cappuccino I had at Redhawk is at the top of the list! Just make sure you drink it from ceramic and not from a paper cup ;) (you American's...) The vibe of the place is also great, a neighborhood coffee shop as it should be!"}
{"text":"Excellent coffee/espresso. Happy he's finally got his own show to run. Hope he has an excellent, long run. The coffee community is better with Braden in it.

That said, I'd love for anyone complaining about the quality of Crazy Mocha's Oakland shop to say that to Emily's face, lol.

Disclaimer: Have known Braden for years, back with TdO and EaM. And I currently work for Crazy Mocha."}
{"text":"Ordered a cappuccino and loved it! The baristas are extremely well trained and very nice. Can't wait to try more of the menu! I wish I had known about this place sooner!"}
{"text":"Can't believe there is an independent and FRIENDLY coffee shop in Oakland! Not snobby at all-- nice and light inside, they will toast bagels for you, serious about coffee-- roasted in Lancaster PA. Oat milk and almond milk options."}
{"text":"A really pleasant little coffee shop. Redhawk reminds me of my favorite hole-in-the-wall coffee shops in San Francisco: nice coffee, prepared nicely, by nice people. Best mocha I've had in years. I'd never had a Cortado before, but I fell in love with them here. Recommend any of the espresso-based drinks. The coffee isn't brewed on-demand, so if you're looking for that, this might not be your place; still, the drip coffee is pretty good, too.

If you needed a coffee shop to become a regular at, this is your place."}
{"text":"I tried Redhawk Coffee for the first time when they were giving out free coffee from their truck on Election Day. Went to the new location this morning since it's very close to my dorm. The employees were very friendly and attentive, the coffee is delicious, and the setting is very quaint. Nice little coffee shop. Go support a local business and try this place."}
{"text":"Great coffee. Amazing owners. Tasty pastries. Looking forward to meeting Brogan, Mary's husband!!!"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff, and great coffee! Stepped in on a whim and walked out with an excellent almond latte. Look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Saw the fantastic reviews and had to stop by while visiting Pittsburgh! Unfortunately they were unable to make decaf espresso drinks when I stopped by but were super helpful in helping me find something else to drink, plus gave me a $1 off! Ended up with one of my faves, the golden milk latte. They use honey to sweeten it and asked me how sweet I wanted it (not very), and it ended up absolutely perfect for my taste. Sad this shop isn't in DC, but I think I'll be back anytime I'm in the burgh."}
{"text":"The space is quite small but the coffee is so good. The price is a little bit pricy but still the coffee is so good."}
{"text":"Updated review:
There's definitely been some changes in the interior of the place: more seating and fun decorations! But the quality of service and coffee is consistent! They use milk from a local place, I believe, and you can definitely taste the quality of it! The baristas are very passionate about their work and the family that owns the place is so sweet, genuine and real.

I highly recommend this place to college students near Oakland! What's not to love?

They also sell delicious ice cream sandwiches! And their pastries taste fresh every day."}
{"text":"very nice people who run this establishment. get the hot chocolate with a shot of hazelnut!"}
{"text":"Great local coffee shop to patronize. I was on business in town from Milwaukee and found this location. Got some excellent coffee from the counterman and told me really enjoys working there.

It will be my go to place in the future if I was a local this place would be jammed with neighborhood customers."}
{"text":"Love this place. I've come here three days in a row for coffee during a meeting I had in Pitt. The staff is very friendly and great with large orders. I much rather support a smaller coffee shop than Starbucks. AND their coffee is great! And reasonably affordable."}
{"text":"Finally a coffee shop in Oakland! Ever since it's first opening, I think this place has done a really great job serving coffee in the oakland area. The first couple weeks of opening, there weren't much interior decor or seating but they've added some tables and chairs so I would say to choose wisely what time to come if you want to sit down with someone to chat or get some work done. Because this is one of the coffee shops close by to the University, UPMC hospital and other offices, it can get quite busy at certain times. The baristas that I've met are all really friendly and do a great job keeping the place clean and welcoming to all their customers.

I normally order the iced vanilla latte and never disappoints :) I've heard the vietnamese cold brew is good so I'll be sure to give that a try next time!"}
{"text":"Honestly last year I was never much for supporting small businesses until Red Hawk opened about two minutes from my college dorm. Now I make a conscious effort to always buy my coffee here instead of Starbucks or Dunkin. The place itself started out with bare walls, not much seating but after returning this summer it's so wonderful to how much it has grown. Getting to come here when it first opened to seeing how far it's come now makes me so proud! 

First off Oakland doesn't really have coffee shops so I was super excited to try this place out. Red Hawk did not disappoint!! As a college student I hate spending 4,5 + dollars on coffee so one thing I like best about this place is the price for the quality of coffee. There's a rich flavor to the coffee which what sets it apart from coffee you can get around campus. Never walk away from here feeling guilty about spending my money here. The owner has put in a lot into this place and it shows through its service and the quality of what they sell. 10/10 would recommend to a friend!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for a 1:1 meeting and it was cute, quaint, and delicious. Located beside Peace Love and Donuts, this shop is very tiny but they serve sweet treats and coffee. The menu and style somewhat remind me of a coffee shop that you'd find in Lawrenceville. Starbucks and Dunkin Donuts dominate this area due to the large number of college students. So it's nice to see independent coffee shops. At the time I went, they only had window seating and one table with a few chairs; I hope they get more seating. I'll definitely go back as the coffee was good, the service was satisfactory, and I will always support independent shops."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Amazing espresso.   Today I had the best dopio... So much so I had to buy some beans.  This is definitely my go to place when in Oakland or anywhere close to here... Yummy!!!"}
{"text":"The coffee is better than your average Starbucks latte, but I feel that it is overpriced for what I get. The shop is really small and cute, but there's very little seating. Good for grab and go coffee when you feel like treating yourself."}
{"text":"Best mocha I've had anywhere. It's creamy and sweet. Best of all, unlike other mochas, the chocolate in this mocha doesn't leave a weird aftertaste."}
{"text":"If you haven't checked out this coffee place yet, you absolutely have to! Very conveniently located  near all of the major hospitals in Oakland, it's one of the best coffee places in town. The owners are extremely nice and knowledgeable. I'm thrilled to have a great coffee shop in Oakland, and I'm especially lucky to have it right next to my office! It is also very reasonably priced. The coffee is unbelievably good, so support the local business!"}
{"text":"This place is a gem! The owner and barista really know what they are doing and the level of product they are producing. It's delicious!! I had two drinks here yesterday and I'm back again the day after. 

The knowledge that everyone has here is amazing! And very friendly. Not to mention the awesome chairs and the window nook!

Come by and try this place out!"}
{"text":"Awesome new coffee place. We have lots of coffee shops around here already, but this place is my new favorite. A little pricey but worth every penny. I never get a place to sit, so adding more seating would be good."}
{"text":"Great coffee, friendly and good service. So glad to have an independent coffee place in Oakland! Will support as much as possible!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I just wanted to update my review to say it's still awesome. The best americano, a really good mocha. I think it's finally chilly out now though, so I think I'm passing on the iced coffee for now. They have Pigeon bagels here, which are delicious. I love that I can grab a local bagel with delicious cream cheese flavors. 

The staff is still awesome and friendly even when they are super busy. The only complaint I have is how small the place is. I usually grab my coffee to go in the morning, but there have been times when I go that I would not have been able to sit down if I wanted to. But! I want them to stay in Oakland so I hope if they ever expand that they don't go far. It's by far the best coffee in Oakland and you'd be really missing out if you skipped this place."}
{"text":"Certainly a delicious coffe, and very friendly people. 
Cool spot!"}
{"text":"This is the best coffee period!!.

The macchiatos are delicious, and the cappuccinos are incredible as well.  But my favorite is the espresso. 

Best espresso by far (Four shots over ice). The atmosphere is chill and the servers are really kind.  Definitely worth coming here."}
{"text":"Very small inside with only one long table and a few stools by the front window, so just know that if you plan to hang out for a while. But the lattes are great and I loved the cool leaf design. The worker said they do a taco bar on Fridays which we thought was a random pairing with coffee and caffeine but hey, who doesn't love fresh tacos?"}
{"text":"Obviously everybody loves this place, and with good reason. Had a well made cappuccino there today, in a ceramic cup, served with a little spoon. Staff handled the post-lunch rush well too. Good buzz to the place, with a number of Europeans who obviously like the coffee too."}
{"text":"This coffee was so good! I got the cold brew which comes in a glass bottle. A little pricey but it is so smooth. There was no need for any type of milk/creamer. The only downside is that there isn't much seating so it's more of a grab and go type coffee shop. It's also a little hidden and if you don't know where you're going, you may miss it! (Hint: it's next to the donut shop.) I'll surely be back.

The parking situation is metered street parking. It's fine if you work or live in the area, then you can just walk and not have to deal with that hassle."}
{"text":"I made a coffee date with a friend and met here since it was new to both of us!  Parking was street parking, and don't think you can just stop and not get ticketed because in the span of the 2 hours my friend and I hung out there, we watched at least 4 people get ticketed.  

There was some seating inside but no outside seating.  

The drinks were delicious and artful, I got a cortado.  Nice variety!  Very informed workers there, they will gladly answer your questions and they obviously care a lot about the quality of ingredients.  This place is pricey, but I found it worth the experience.

People came and went, studying, reading, stopping in for a coffee to go, the works.  Seating is sometimes plentiful and when there's a rush, not so much.  

The decor is adorable, sorta hipster rustic.  Very small space inside.  No bathroom though!
Water is provided in a jug to the left of the counter, with little serve-your-self-glasses. 

After my friend and I were there for 2 hours, the girl at the cash register brought us some free, fancy  seltzer water for us to enjoy!"}
{"text":"An absolutely wonderful spot - I'm so happy there's quality coffee in Oakland now! Plus, Braden (the owner) and his employees never fail to make your day!"}
{"text":"I'm happy to see some great coffee in Oakland. The coffee was very good, the shop has a nice vibe. Very friendly and helpful"}
{"text":"Good coffee. Ordered a latte, which is not cheap. It is worthwhile for the good quality. Love the atmosphere and service is great."}
{"text":"Great service and awesome location. Try their cold brew! Served in a nice glass bottle and totally on point! Will definitely visit again"}
{"text":"Had the good fortune of enjoying Redhawk via their truck at the wedding of some dear friends. (For future reference: coffee truck + typical Pittsburgh cookie table = solid wedding dessert decision). I loved their Vietnamese cold brew coffee, and had to go back for last call for a hazelnut latte, both of which were absolutely delicious. I have stopped by their storefront for a quick morning coffee but haven't had the chance to linger. Excited to enjoy more of their menu!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my cappuccino more than most of the chain coffee shops but I wish it was a better place to study. I'll be back while in Oakland, but won't come out of my way. I only go out of my way for coffee when it is either exceptional coffee or a good place to study. The coffee was good, not exceptional."}
{"text":"You know, I doubted the reviews before coming here and I feel bad for doing so. Finally got to stop in and loved everything about it. The interior decor, menu, pricing, and patrons. My barista was so friendly and genuine in wanting to create the best drink for me. I got an oat milk mocha which was smooth and not overbearingly sweet, just how I like it. Can't forget the cute latte art--even while ordering to-go--what a nice surprise. They don't have soy milk but there are other nondairy options such as oat milk and almond milk. The shop is really small so you will need some luck in finding a table of you plan to stay. Overall I'd say it's a better place for a grab and go coffee due to the space limitation. Will be making more stops here when in Oakland! You should too!"}
{"text":"This place is as good as the reviews say!! The coffee was delicious (I got an oat milk latte) and the service is incredible. The barista is very accommodating and really took his time with my drink. 

The only thing to keep in mind is that they are slow since they take so much time with each customer, so don't go if you're in a rush!"}
{"text":"Nice to see real coffee in Oakland.  Had a very nice macchiato at the bar and took a cappuccino to go for my wife.  Both were expertly prepared with wonderful crema in the espresso.  Place is cozy so I can imagine finding a place to sit can be a problem if you are looking to hangout."}
{"text":"Everything everyone says in their reviews is true - the employees actually like their job and it's obvious in the way they simply take your order.  The coffee was pretty good too.  I had a caramel macchiato and truly enjoyed it.

It isn't a large space, it would be awesome if it was.  The large window is great for people watching.  If you need a pick-me-up, pick Redhawk."}
{"text":"Love this place and the coffee is so good! I don't usually care for being a coffee snob but I honestly can drink it black because it's so good. Expected prices to be too high for me but they are really fair. Medium coffee is $2 and lattes are $3-4. It's also great to support the new business. Highly recommend trying this out and supporting the local business."}
{"text":"Great people great coffee!! Brady is awesome and took the time to tell me things about my long espresso that I didn't even know. Great experience all around."}
{"text":"Redhawk bean juice FTW! 

And chocolate!  Try the mocha! Made with local chocolate milk from the chocolate cows of course. This is an awesome coffee shop and the best in Oakland! If you're looking for some great mocha, aeropress, latte or even drip coffee, check this place out!

The staff is super friendly and fun and always in a great mood. They cycle through some really great coffee brands most other shops don't carry like four barrel and counter culture and the staffs more than helpful and happy to tell you your options and what each are like.

They even have a few specialty items they can brew up from time to time if you get to know them well. They have great bagels and food trucks right outside on certain days of the week. If you're looking for something with high octane check out their bottle of cold brew! ?"}
{"text":"Pleasant little standalone coffee shop that's open and that's near Pitt campus ftw? No, but actually this is probably the first of its own that's actually very accessible to students between classes. Though it's a bit on the small side (hard to find a seat when it's busy/full), this place serves up some legit coffee. Tried a Vietnamese Cold Brew since I found the name intriguing and it's as good as it gets. As cold brew implies, it skimps on the cream & sugar but I found such more than satisfying and one of the better cold brews I've had in recent history. They also sell your standard fare of espresso-based drinks, pastries, and oh did I mention ... ice cream sandwiches (Leona's), which not only come in interesting flavors but is rather dope in taste as well. Perfect place for getting a cup of joe. Would highly recommend a visit!"}
{"text":"Finally! A small, independent coffee shop in Oakland!
Let me start with the environment: it's small, but it's a very clean, welcoming, and well-lit shop. Moving to the counter, the baristas were incredibly friendly, kept a conversation, and readily helped to clarify my order (I ordered an Americano, but they made sure that I was aware it would only have one shot of espresso in it). The baristas and I chatted for a bit and they were incredibly friendly. They also knew how to pull the espresso shot and didn't rush my order, which I really appreciated.
They care about their product and the experience. Great cup of coffee. I'll be back soon for my grad classes!"}
{"text":"It's not often that you find a craft coffee spot where people are ordering magics and cortados that also happily (and kindly) serves excellent tea. This is but one of the many ways Redhawk is a refreshing departure from the norm.

I spend a lot of time in coffee shops, even though I'm allergic to coffee, and it can get real depressing drinking plain water or subpar, overly sweet chai whilst my companions swoon about their single origin brews. 

Not so at Redhawk! The fine folks here have a laudable selection of tea and didn't bat an eye when I asked for the vanilla rooibos to be turned into a tea latte.

Thank you Redhawk for making my stay in Pittsburgh extra lovely. I will miss your tea lattes when I head back home to San Francisco!"}
{"text":"As someone who isn't into coffee, Redhawk was definitely the place to be. With a striking red door that caught my eye on the way to class, Redhawk also have a very aesthetic appearance on the inside as well. Seating was minimal and seemed like most people would grab and go. The baristas were informative and made very pleasant conversation giving this small place an even more friendly feel. After deciding on an oat milk latte, the baristas made all the drinks quickly and beautifully. As for the coffee, the latte was tasteful and prepared with care. I could see coffee enthusiasts be more critical, however, I don't have much knowledge and just thought the taste was much better than most coffees I've had before."}
{"text":"Best local option in Oakland. Good atmosphere and great customer service. Very minimalistic but that's the draw. Coffee is great and so is the espresso, would recommend a shot in the dark (black coffee with a shot of espresso)."}
{"text":"THE BEST COFFEE IN OAKLAND. 
Enough said.

--
They bring croissants and other fresh pastries from a french bakery called La Gourmandine(which is my favorite bakery!!!) and of course the pastry is so delicious. They run out quite fast, so sometimes you have to go to next door to get the donuts instead.
Coffee beans are very fresh and it does not taste as bitter as Starbucks coffee or as sour as Dunkin' coffee. Very Well blended. Latte art is decent too. They also do the latte art with soy milk (or was it almond milk?) too- THAT was really impressive, actually.
Space is kinda small, and it closes around 6pm - so not the best place to study for the students, but their coffee is too good to resist. Just gotta go and grab coffee."}
{"text":"Fantastic coffee and in a great location in Oakland. 

It's great to finally have a high quality coffee option in the Oakland area."}
{"text":"They seem to love what they do at Redhawk. The passion shows up as hot, fresh, rich coffee; a super-friendly barista who sings you his wishes for a great day; and inexpensive prices. Too bad there isn't more seating - I would have enjoyed drinking my coffee there. The shop is closed at times when one would expect a coffee shop to be open, including early Saturday and all day Sunday. An overall winner but not a destination."}
{"text":"These guys are awesome.  Great espresso and aeropress/pourover.  I haven't had the lattes but I've seen that they are really skilled w/ latte art as well, for what that's worth.

It is bizarrely hard to find decent coffee in Pittsburgh.  Until Redhawk opened there was literally no decent coffee in Oakland / within walking distance of Pitt.  This place is badly needed and is by far the best coffee in the area."}
{"text":"Awesome little coffee shop and certainly a welcome addition to Oakland. This place provides a nice change of pace if you are sick of the questionable smell at the Starbucks on Forbes a block down the road. Perhaps not so surprisingly, Redhawk also offers a better cup of coffee for less money than Sbux. Bonus: very friendly staff that gives a crap about making good coffee and doesn't constantly try to misspell or otherwise butcher your name."}
{"text":"Great coffee, and incredibly friendly, hospitable owners and staff.  Cortado, macchiato, cappuccino, and drip coffee ... all excellent.  The location is pretty convenient if you work or go to school in Oakland, or even if you work downtown and want to uber/lyft over for a nice coffee break."}
{"text":"Good espresso and very friendly staff. Better product than chains. Worth checking out for sure."}
{"text":"This place is the BEST! When I found out Oakland was getting a non-chain coffeeshop, I knew I had to check this place out. The people, the coffee, the space, everything is absolutely amazing here. They make one of the best mochas I've ever had, using local chocolate milk and lots of loveeee. That's the thing I probably love most about this place, is that you can tell all of the baristas love what they do. 

Besides the mocha, I like getting their regular drip coffee or a latte. I also know they have a vietnamese cold brew that I've been meaning to try, and their bagel/croissant selection also looks amazing! Oat milk and almond milk are available here as well. During the morning work hours and around lunch time, the place gets extremely busy. They have limited seating, so expect to take your coffee to go if you come around these hours! On the off hours, however, you can find a comfy spot to study or chat with friends/coworkers. They place music in the shop, but it's at a nice volume where it isn't distracting. 

This place is definitely going to be one of the things I'll miss most once I graduate from Pitt this year!"}
{"text":"Making its triumphant entrance as Oakland's only independent coffee shop, Redhawk Coffee hits the nail on the head. The owner is passionate and amicable, bumping punk music and chatting with customers as he brews his product with enthusiasm. I can't really drink coffee right now, but I sampled my buddy's Vietnamese cold brew, and I was upset that I couldn't finish the bottle. They are very specific in labeling the percentages of coffee varieties in each brew. Whether intentional or not, Redhawk provides an educational experience for its campus customers. The atmosphere of the shop is very homemade, with old-school, Darwinian looking biological/zoological art strewn along the walls, further emphasizing shop's organic feel.

If you're passionate about coffee, trying to support local businesses, looking for a cool place to meet up with friends or colleagues, or just wanna talk chop with some awesome baristas, Redhawk is the hippest option available in Oakland."}
{"text":"I was just introduced to Redhawk yesterday and am already adding a budget line for what will be frequent visits here. Amazing espresso and super friendly service with prices comparable to Starbucks. Seating is limited compared to other area coffee shops, but the quality blows the main chains out of the water. Easily some of the best espresso I've ever had. So excited to support this local business and enjoy fantastic espresso on the regular!!!"}
{"text":"This my yelper friends is 5 star coffee
Little tiny shop with a couple of seats
Just come for the coffee
Super friendly barista
Answered all my questions 
Elaine wanted half n half 
My coffee was perfection in a cup
In a glass jar were treats looked like a biscotti ...I was told they are Jewish Pizzas 
The owner's Dad creation nutty fruity thick slices of perfect go with coffee goodness 
Go try it's worth it
Red hawk is my new fav coffee of the burgh"}
{"text":"My fav go to coffee shop in Pittsburgh! I got their tumeric latte and it was SO GOOD! Parking (Oakland area) and seatings area were limited that's why I gave it 4 out of 5, other than that, i love this cute tiny coffee shop!"}
{"text":"This place has the best coffee in Pittsburgh. It's an absolute must when you need a caffeine fix. Plus great bagels + kombucha."}
{"text":"I could go on, but the short version is Redhawk is the best there is or could be. Add to that is the owner, Braden, who is beyond cool and great guy. Go there!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic beans. Not really a sit-down coffee shop, but there are plenty of those in Oakland already. Redhawk is the place for delicious espresso."}
{"text":"Before Redhawk, there was no decent coffee in Oakland. I stop in here most afternoons for an espresso. The coffee is fantastic, and the staff is really friendly.

Great spot to do a little work (though not so much for the whole day, since they don't have a ton of seating, and it's more of a coffee shop where people come to chat with colleagues)."}
{"text":"My first impression of Redhawk was that it was really cute (but surprisingly tiny for such a busy part of town). If you're lucky enough to go when one of the three tables or few bar stools are free, this would be a nice little place to do some work. However, if it's any type of busy at all, I could see longer waits and the need to take your coffee to-go.

The coffee itself - I got a black drip - was nothing special. It tasted fairly watery, and didn't have any real tasting notes. However, the barista was friendly, and I think it's great that Redhawk is trying to stake out its place amongst the many corporate shops in Oakland. I'll probably try it again in the future to see if maybe it was just a bad brew day (especially since there's so many other reviews saying it's great), or to try a latte."}
{"text":"Favorite coffee in the whole city. The shop is small but the vibe is amazing and the coffee even better. Get a drip coffee or an espresso drink or even a hand prepared option like an AeroPress."}
{"text":"Came in on a Tuesday morning while moving my little sister into her dorm room. I was really interested in their Vietnamese coffee. They serve it hot and cold. And get this they even bottle it! So it looked like I was drinking a cold beer at 11am. There's lots of other things on the menu that look good. I'll be back again when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite coffee shop in this town. Just some awesome coffee and good vibes! Check this place out if you're visiting! No regrets here"}
{"text":"Finally a great coffee shop in Oakland!
Thoroughly enjoyed their cold brew.
Would recommend for the great atmosphere as well."}
{"text":"Great great coffee! A little cozy on seating, but they deliver on the java, and nice basic eats. Definitely a fave of both Pitt and CMU students !"}
{"text":"Applause, bro. 

Let's make that APPLAUSE. BRO. 

First of all, Braden Walter has a pretty cool story to tell. A story about Coffee People helping Coffee People. Here, read the article: http://pittnews.com/article/115046/featured/redhawk-brings-independent-coffee-oakland/
So this has made a progression from a coffee truck to a brick and mortar shop. Still a one man crew, (at least it was when I was there) and it can't be much bigger in size than the coffee truck could have been. But that's what I love about Redhawk. It's so low-key, so personal and so satisfying. 

And the coffees indeed were pleasant. The current lineup included Passenger- Lancaster, PA, Dogwood- Minneapolis, and Four Barrel with De La Paz- San Francisco. I've noted since that they're utilizing Cat and Cloud's liquid gold. That's great. And so was the coffee by Dogwood I tried. Espresso. It was tasty. Braden said it would be. Do not take Redhawk lightly. This place is real."}
{"text":"Small coffee shop that makes incredible-tasting coffee! It's conveniently located next to my work so whenever I feel like eloping meetings, work, pretend that I'm working really hard for hours, meeting online-dating prospects mid-day, or just finding a getaway to do some work this is the perfect place to do it!

Staff is incredibly friendly, perhaps some of the friendliest I've come across. Coffee is amazing, and they provide free refills if you sit in. My only concern is that seating is very limited, and one of the few times I did get a table, the screws were a bit loose so the table was very wobbly. The ambiance is so friendly, I was thinking about asking them for a screwdriver so I could just tighten the screws, but my date urged me otherwise... .... ....

Overall great coffee, even better staff and service!"}
{"text":"If you want to get away from the typical crowded coffee joints like Dunkin' or Starbucks, try this place! Decent, hidden little gem of a coffee place hidden next to Peace, Love, and Little Doughnuts, one of those blink-and-you'll-miss-it type coffee shops. You're greeted by the friendly owner, who, when I asked, kindly gave me a sample of the chai mixture used to make the chai latte. He keeps up a constant stream of friendly banter as he makes your drink, and you guys both talk a bit about your day. 

I ordered an 8oz chai latte, and boy, should I have gotten the bigger one! Spicy, slightly savory with a hint of sweetness and slightly creamy without overwhelming the senses, since I took mine with almond milk instead of regular. 

Although there isn't a ton of seating, which I think should change as this place becomes more established (it's barely been open a month), it feels much more spacious this way. The decor is eclectic, but minimal-not too gaudy or distracting. If you get a seat at the table, it's a perfect place for studying. I'm excited to have come here, can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"I've been here many more times since it opened and I'm updating my rating since the coffee is fantastic and service always excellent. Just wish they had more seating to hang out."}
{"text":"Loved the cold brew! It comes in a cool bottle and a tag that specifies the blend composition. I enjoyed it because the bottle is already chilled and since there's no ice, I can sip it slowly on a hot day without the flavor diluting within a few minutes.

The bottle is even branded with their logo and the barista was super friendly!"}
{"text":"Probably the best cold brew I've ever had. I hope there's a non-Oakland location someday because I would really like to be a more regular patron."}
{"text":"Great coffee great atmosphere and super friendly staff.  Nice place to visit along the college strip. Check em out."}
{"text":"Excellent Coffee, beautifully made cappuccinos, great pastry locally made. Only a few tables. We love it!"}
{"text":"Awesome place with awesome people serving awesome coffee. Small storefront, but rounds out a good Oakland experience with the only thing the neighborhood was missing: great coffee. I could grab an americano before grabbing groceries at Merante's, or stop in for a cold brew fix after hitting Chick'n'Bubbly and before losing track of time at the Carnegie or Caliban's. Or, you know, I could just stop in because I'm in Oakland want some coffee.

Also, they serve their cold brew in glass bottles, which makes me feel hip as heck."}
{"text":"I hereby dub thee the best coffee shop in PA. Period. Nice rotation of new beans and still keeping around the classics. Talented and friendly baristas make the experience even more enjoyable."}
{"text":"This is my favorite coffee shop in Pittsburgh so far! Although it doesn't have much seating, the strong, flavorful, and perfectly balanced espresso and brews are well worth the trip! They also feature numerous different roasters, so you can always try a new bean. 

It's also conveniently located next to a donut shop..."}
{"text":"Great coffee (and that's coming from a Seattlelite. The barista was super friendly and chatted me up for a bit. It's cheap too."}
{"text":"Cozy coffee shop within a stone's throw of Pitt campus. Try the mocha made with Brunton's Dairy Chocolate milk. Very delicious! Friendly and welcoming barista."}
{"text":"Finally, a non shitty coffee place in Oakland. So far so good. The cortados and lattes are as good as the higher end coffee places in pitt (21 street coffee, Espresso a Mano, Commonplace, Zeeks, etc) but the important part is the location. Its in the college center, a place nearly devoid of quality establishments! Great addition to the area."}
{"text":"I have passed this newer coffee shop on my way to and from work and have never ventured inside. Yesterday I thought, why not. It is usually pretty bumping and when I was walking past it seemed a little less crowded. I am not the biggest fan of lots of people in small spaces so I tend to shy away from shops that make me feel like I cannot breathe. So as I looked in the window I saw that there was room to walk around in and thought, \"why not\". 

The lady at the front counter was really nice. She answered my questions about the things on the menu and we even talked a little about the things that were for sale on the walls. It was a very pleasant experience. I ended up being intrigued by the Vietnamese coffee that they had on the menu. Lo and behold all that it was was iced coffee with condensed milk in it. Who would have thought that something that I sometimes do to use up condensed milk would be for have a name. Maybe I am fancier than I thought or trendier. 

The lady at the counter asked if I was taking this to go, probably because I did not take a seat like the other people in the shop. I thought that was really nice and thoughtful of her to ask before she poured it in a cup and then would have had to re-pour it in a to-go cup.  I get that it saved her the hassle but, sometimes people do not ask and then it stinks to have to go back up and say, well...you know.. I actually wanted this to go.

The coffee was STRONG. Even with the condensed milk it was stronger than I assumed it would be. I took it back to the office and cut it with a little bit of sweet cream creamer I have on hand. I should have tried it at the shop and asked for more of the condensed milk,  but that was my fault not theirs. The coffee was really good. I liked the smooth taste and once I got used to it being strong and cut it with creamer I really enjoyed it. The price was a bit higher than I would have normally paid for a cup of coffee but sometimes you just have to splurge to try out a new place and see how it goes. And I actually drank half the cup the next day because of how strong it was so really, one cup for that price and two days, kinda made up for it. 

The seating of Redhawk is less than desirable. But that is because it is a small intimate shop. If you get there early with friends and grab a table it would be fine, but if not, you are standing around or just grabbing a cup and walking out the door. I liked that it is a small little place, but if it gets too crowded I would probably skip it for something a little easier to deal with. 

There is one drink that I want to go back to try. They make a turmeric latte and that really caught my eye. I take turmeric pills for my joints and I would love to see how the latte is made and if it is good. If so, I might then have to get some on the days that my joints are really crying out. I wish that I would have seen this drink before I made my selection. But the menu is hung on some paper over the register and this was a little sign behind something at the register. I would hope that maybe the next time they would put all the menu items by the menu. 

I liked this place. It was better than I thought and I would go back. I think that it was a cute little shop and hopefully when I go in next it is not as busy so maybe I can sit and enjoy the shop."}
{"text":"The cold brew is like rocket fuel. It's my favorite in town. The atmosphere is great. The owner is a pleasure to chitchat with. If you're in Oakland and need caffeine, this is your place!"}
{"text":"Came on a Tuesday morning and ordered a latte + almond croissant, which was absolutely delicious - the perfect balance of crispy outside and soft dough inside. There isn't too much different from any other coffee shop in terms of variety... they have all the typical espresso, latte, mocha, cold brew, bagels and basic pastries. However, I can't rave enough about the great service (despite being extremely busy at times) and the very welcoming and relaxing environment. Although the seating can get a bit crowded, there is a pretty good turnover so you're bound to find a seat eventually. The tables are pretty widely spaced too so you don't feel cramped while trying to get work done. Great music as well.

Tl;dr
Typical coffee shop selections, but amazing people.
Great place to work/study.
Spacious and comfortable."}
{"text":"Thank God there is finally an excellent coffee joint in Oakland! Braden the owner and chief barista makes superb coffee and espresso in what is mostly a walk-in setting. However, there is one table, a couple of stools, and a couple comfy chairs, if you are lucky enough to snag one. One huge advantage this place has is that it's the only place I know of in the East End where you can get La Gourmandine pastries."}
{"text":"Was excited to try this new coffee shop in the Oakland area. A very small shop with not a lot of seating. The menu is pretty basic with lattes, espresso, mocha, etc. I got the medium mocha because the small was super tiny. It was $4, which is around the same price of Starbucks. 

The staff was super friendly and definitely made me want to come back. I was also happy to see a cute heart on my mocha. My mocha was great, not too sweet and could still taste some of the coffee. Overall, a nice change from the classic Starbucks or Dunkin on Forbes. I know I will be back!"}
{"text":"They make a mean golden milk latte (milk, turmeric, ginger, cardamom, pink pepper, honey). I also like their matcha lattes-- which they use unsweetened matcha. A lot of places add sugar to their matcha lattes, which I think is a ploy to mask subpar quality matcha. 

Doesn't seem like there's that much sitting room for doing work unless you get there earlier."}
{"text":"Awesome coffee, great service, nice people"}
{"text":"I'll preface this review by saying, I don't like coffee. 
I do love chai tea and other forms of tea, and the chai latte mix they have is so so so good. It is much less sweet than any other mix I've had, to where it tastes much more natural. It still had tons of flavor though. Also, the barista was very friendly and that's always a plus. I will definitely be going back for their tea."}
{"text":"Bottled iced coffee was really good and the service was great. Delicious caramel latte too! Really cute decor."}
{"text":"First off, the coffee is just perfect. You can tell this barista knows what he's doing and loves to simply make a great drink for each and every customer. Additionally, the prices are so reasonable! But what I might love most about this place is the staff interaction. I've been here several times now, and the barista (possible owner, as well) is so darn friendly! He makes a point to ask every customer how his or her day is going, what exciting plans are coming up for the weekend, etc. The kids and wife (I think) are there often, and you can see this is such a loving family. And THAT is the kind of place and business I like to spend my money. In a time where customer service and the love of a good, small business is dwindling, this little shop is just the breath of fresh air we all need. As a doc student I spend A LOT of time on campus, and I'm enjoying this change from the typical Starbucks..."}
{"text":"So glad this place just opened up on campus as a new alternative to Starbucks! I stopped in yesterday for an iced latte to go. The owners are very friendly and the cafe, while small, is nicely decorated and there is enough seating/tables there if you want to settle in and get some work done. They also have fresh pastries from La Gourmandine in Lawrenceville which is a huge plus :) 

The coffee was really delicious and they even used fresh milk straight from a milk jar! It was just strong enough without being bitter, and the prices are pretty fair as well. I will definitely be making this my go-to for coffee in Oakland."}
{"text":"High quality ingredients. Even better service. Great location- 3 minute walk from UPMC Presbyterian and Montefiore. It's about time Oakland has an authentic coffee shop! Well done!"}
{"text":"Best coffee I've had in North America! Awesome Barista, cool lounge area & decent enough wifi."}
{"text":"You pretty much have to drag me to Oakland for a meeting or social engagement... But one things for sure, I do not go willingly. Between the mess of parking and millennial students, this old lady can't handle it!

But let me tell you, my special treat to cheer me up will always be a stop at Redhawk. I stopped in for the first time recently and was pleasantly surprised to see a familiar face behind the espresso bar. It was one of my fave barista's from espresso a mano in Lawrenceville. Come to find out, he owns Redhawk! This makes me so happy to see genuinely passionate people fulfilling their dreams and creating a successful business! 

Aside from that, kudos for also making their own chai concentrate. I really hate a lot of the boxed brand chai, as most of them are too sweet. This one was the perfect blend of spicy with a little sweetness. 

This will now always be my treat when in Oakland, that will make me happy after fighting for parking at least!"}
{"text":"Amazing coffee, wonderful service, great treats. Best coffee shop in Pittsburgh."}
