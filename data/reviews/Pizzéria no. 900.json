{"text":"J'adore dîner à la Pizzeria no.900 situé dans les promenades St-Bruno. Salade césar + pizza du jour pour 9.99$. Je dirais qu'il pourrait améliorer un peu le service mais ce n'était pas si mal non plus. Le décor est très joli. Parfait pour une pause magasinage quand on n'a pas envie de manger dans la foire de restaurants!"}
{"text":"I went to Pizzéria no. 900 for lunch, at their new location at the St-Bruno shopping mall.

Their pizza is very good, and so was the caesar salad I took as a side. No complaints there, they know their pizza! Crust, toppings, everything was perfect.

The service seems a bit (a lot?) disorganized, however. This may be due to the fact that its a new location. When I entered the restaurant, I waited over 5 minutes and no one ever acknowledged me or even looked at me. They seemed too busy, yet it wasn't rush hour, the restaurant was 3/4 empty. I finally had to approach someone to get a reaction. They're lucky I really had a craving for good pizza as I would have left otherwise.

As I was waiting, no one ever came back to ask if it was ok or if I wanted more water. I was eating outside on the patio. After I finished I waited a bit for someone to come to me, and waited. I finally went inside. All the waiters around the register. They were having problems with the system. Ok, fine, but do they need ALL the waiters to work on this issue?

Worst, they couldn't issue a bill. And I couldn't pay by credit card. I had to go to the nearby ATM and pay the fees to withdraw money. They haven't offered anything for the inconvenience or extra fees.

Food? Very good and that's why I'm giving it at least 3 stars. I would perhaps try another location. But I sure won't be back at this one. 1 star for service."}
