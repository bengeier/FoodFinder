{"text":"Brunch is over priced and the quality of the food isn't good. If your looking for soul food its not the place to go. Service was good though."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to try this place a few days ago. Admittedly, we are early diners... arriving around 5:30 on a Thursday night.   We purposely avoided the \" kids eat free\" nights since we are decidedly past the \"every kid is adorable\" generation. 

We were greeted by a very pleasant young man who seemed to be ( I suspect) completing his homework at a back table.  He introduced himself as a busboy who was unable to recommend anything from the menu... although, he did tell us that ribs were his favorite item. 

An eager waitress arrived and the Mrs. ordered chicken fried steak with appropriate sides, while I opted for the catfish dinner with onion rings and stuffing. 

I will be brief... I suggest you avoid the dry, over-cooked chicken fried steak... even the local Bob Evans restaurant does a better  job with this standard.  But, the fried catfish was blissful!  Flaky, moist and tastefully sweet!  Try it!

We plan to return but,  Jenni please turn down the garish annoying overhead lighting!"}
{"text":"Despite the weird name for this restaurant, it is very cozy and had YUMMY food. The price is super cheap and their breakfast is just DELISH!"}
{"text":"We had heard this place had good food so decided to give it try.  Service was polite and prompt and seemed to know the menu.  My girlfriend had the special of the day, hash, which was very good.  I had the standard eggs, waffle, home fries.  Unfortunately they were pretty standard and did not stand out in any way.  Also, my eggs and home fries were far from hot when they came out.  Not a bad place but not as good as I was hoping.  Maybe try it again for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Service was great, food was really good, portions were of a good value. This place is fun, lots of southern style choices that I seldom see around here. We'll be back."}
{"text":"I went in there today for the brunch and someone was holding a lap dog in their arms and the owners and servers came up and were petting the dog. I LOVE dogs but I do not want to eat in a restaurant with a dog in it, no more than going out to eat and someone is changing a diaper in the dining area. I will not be back."}
{"text":"We read some reviews here on yelp and decided to give it a try... Not to mention the fantastic $20 voucher for $10!

We went for today's Sunday brunch and were very pleased with the offering.  Sarah was patiently awaiting direction for either fresh fluffy Belgium waffles or made-to-order omelets with all the fixings.  There was also eggs Benedict, large slices of crispy bacon, and sausage gravy and biscuits made from scratch.  Your choice of fruit salad or Cobb.

If you have a lunch/dinner appetite (we sure did) then you had your fill of fried chicken, baked fish, BBQ ribs, and twisted Mac & cheeses.

Truly, something for everyone!

Started with fruit which was ripe and fresh.  Followed with a piece of chicken which was juicy, tender, and had a good flavor.  The ribs were succulent and very easy to eat with a decent sauce... Not good enough to cry over but absolutely would come back for a full slab dinner.  The twisted Mac was good creamy and cheesy (my daughters fav) which is really all you want in Mac n cheese.  They had hot sweet yam sections that are one of my favorites!  they were every bit as tender, sweet, and starchy as i desire.  The sausage gravy was runnier then I'm used too but with a good bold flavor however the biscuits were cold and lacked much flavor... If there wasn't gravy, not sure I could use enough butter or jam/jelly to get through a whole one.  Loved the thick and crisp bacon!  I had it along with a serving of eggs Benedict... Which had a unique sweet flavor to it.  Seemed like there was syrup between the muffin and ham which I wasn't too fond of.  To end it all the waffle was the best part!  Somewhat crisp. But so fluffy and soft I topped mine with a little butter, fresh strawberries and there homemade strawberry sauce which wasn't too sweet and went perfect on the waffle.  I could've eaten the waffles w/strawberries all day!

Give it a try, you have more to gain then you do to lose!"}
{"text":"I had heard rumors that a Southern Style Restaurant opened up in Avon Lake so I had to try it.  I went on a Thursday Night and picked up a to go order.  The Menu is pretty extensive and they do a nice array of Southern home cooked favorites.  I opted for the Brisket, Mac n Twists, and Fried Green Tomato's.  First off, they give you a ton of food and I thought the Brisket was very good except the BBQ Blueberry Sauce was a put on pretty heavy.  However, the Fried Green Tomatos were excellent and so was the Mac and Cheese.  The Sauce for the Tomatoes was awesome, kinda like a spicy aioli, but very good.  The dinner also came with a Salad that was good too, try the Cilantro Lime Ranch House Dressing too.  

Decor, nice and cozy but nothing special. Its actually pretty small in there and not good for large groups.  The menu also features, Sandwiches, Ribs, Fried Chicken, Pulled Pork, Seafood, and a lot of other homestyle foods.  

I will be definetly be back!  Also, come hungry because you won't have an empty stomach when you leave."}
{"text":"We have eaten here quite a few times and love it! The pork chops are a must try! Come on Sundays for the all you can eat brunch you won't be sorry! I have a service dog and they welcome him with open arms! The owner and the wait staff are friendly, efficient and fun."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Great staff!! Real home cooking type menu too. We tried breakfast a few weeks ago and it was delicious. Really great, friendly and efficient staff really took care if us. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is no longer in business, as of 11/2/2014 or earlier. Sign is down and windows are covered."}
{"text":"I got the Blue burger and it was perfect. When I got back I'm going to try the Junky Jugs. Everything was great and the service was fast. Went there on a lunch break and was able to get our food in a timely manner to get back to the office. Will be a regular."}
{"text":"One preliminary warning: The Yelp map is way off.  Jenni Juggs is at the strip mall at the intersection of Lear and Walker (with a Giant Eagle and Taki's) and not, inexplicably, across the street from the high school.  To make things even harder, the restaurant doesn't show up on Google Maps.

Had a late dinner (around 8pm) at Jenni Juggs over the Christmas week holiday.  The restaurant was pretty empty, with one other table occupied when I came in and only two others occupied while we dined.  I was a little concerned that no one was manning the front when I came in, so I just stood there for a couple of minutes hoping to get someone's attention.  It would have been nice if any of the kitchen staff (who I know did notice me) would have at least alerted the appropriate person that someone was in the restaurant looking to get seated.

Past that, though, I thought the food was decent, with a mix of hits and misses.  I started out with the Savory Sausage Gravy, which was okay, but not something I'd particularly recommend.  The sausage gravy was a little flat and the biscuits were pretty unexciting.  For an entree, I went with the classic fried chicken and waffles, which I thought was decent.  The fried chicken is pretty good and, as the menu says, is presented simply--not too breaded or anything and with just a little bit of spice to add some Southern flair to it.  My friends split a Potato Pancake Reuben, which looked impressive in both its size and in its potato pancake top and bottom.  The unassuming highlight of the meal for me, though, was the side of hush puppies, which come as these fried puffy balls of batter, just a little bit smaller than oversized marshmallows.  Having spent some time in North Carolina, I thought I knew what a good hush puppy was supposed to be, but the Jenni Juggs hush puppies blow all those away, and it'll probably be those hush puppies that will have me coming back some time.

I would have liked to try their homemade Sweet Tea, but decided to pass, for now, for slightly healthier alternatives.  The word is that a permit to serve alcohol is in the works."}
{"text":"I really like this place. The first time was just for a cocktail while my partner was shopping. I was impressed that they don't rip you off on the drinks. Very nice of them. Can't bump up the rating because there was celery in my bloody mary because that should be standard practice, and way too many places get away with it. 

Very nice people working there. Good service. 

I was intrigued by the menu, and it delivered. 

My partner got a huge elk burger, too bloody for me to taste, but he's still ranting about it 3 months later. He loved everything! Raved about the cornbread, said it's especially good with the gumbo that was spicy. I like spice and that's why I wanted the gumbo. I prefer it thicker, but their gumbo has so much meat in it that it needs to be in a thin broth. I ordered the salad with greens and got an iceburg lettuce one. I'd have rather gone without, but I didn't complain. Fried green tomatoes were soggy. 

I look forward to letting them completely win me over. I'll be back. Nice menu. I really want to try the alligator."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday; group of 5. Some had brunch others ordered menu items. Overall food was decent and priced well. However two issues: 1.) service was terrible and slow; attitude was they were doing us a favor by waiting on us. Also, we were seated adjacent to the service station and the server, who was standing around, felt the need to sing along with every single song!  2.) I think the kitchen ventilation needs to be checked - we walked out of there smelling like a deep fryer and the air in the restaurant was a little hazy."}
{"text":"Come hungry! We came here for breakfast and it was delicious. The dining area is small, but has a great warm & inviting atmosphere. The owner was actually our waitress and you can tell she really cares about her place and making sure the customer is happy! Can't wait to come back for dinner."}
{"text":"Great Sunday Brunch and excellent service.  Ribs, chicken, fish, omelettes, eggs benedict, mashed potato, stuffing, salad, fruit, Belgian Waffles, ham, bacon, desserts.  Sunday 11-2."}
{"text":"I am sad to say we found JJs very disappointing, and we had wanted so badly to like this local restaurant. My husband and I ordered carry out...which I always give a restaurant some leeway here bc carry out is tough to do well and even great food can suffer in a styrofoam container. That being said.....so disappointing. Canned vegetables, no seasoning on anything, fried green tomatoes still tasted of uncooked flour soaked in oil, bland coleslaw. Just completely lack luster sides. Country green beans were just barely warm  canned beans...no ham or any seasoning. Husbands stuffed pork chops were just thin chops topped w a mound of cubed potatoes and smothered in cheese. My fried chicken wasn't too bad at all though, but again zero seasoning. It was all just so disappointing."}
