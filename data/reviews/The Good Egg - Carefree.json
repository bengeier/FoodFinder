{"text":"This place was below average. Specializing in breakfast, I'd think it would have been better. Denny's is a better alternative."}
{"text":"Great breakfast friendly staff reasonable prices what more could you want. The good egg is now part of the First Watch which I frequent in Florida, very pleased all around."}
{"text":"This used to be our favorite breakfast place.  However, since the change over the food quality has declined.  What used to be the best bacon around is now no better than the rest.  Sad.  However there is the new Kale juice which is awesome!"}
{"text":"Awesome food! I love their four peaks French toast but all their omelets are also really good! The servers and nice and attentive and the strawberry lemonade is not only pretty but pretty tasty."}
{"text":"Awesome service, super kind waiters, although we had to wait a little longer for our drinks then usual. The kids menu has a large variety of meals while on the regular menu, I want everything!!!! The food was awesome, the \"berry a more\" was dessert for breakfast, and the French toast and breakfast sandwich was awesome. Reasonably priced and freshly squeezed orange juice. Definitely a great place."}
{"text":"Lately the food has gone downhill. Ordered the eggs benny today and the white part of the egg was as runny as the yoke. (Yuck)   Bacon was burnt to a crisp. It was literally black and tasted like charcoal. The hash browns were raw and had a pool of grease under them. Not really sure what is up with this Good Egg!  Really bad!!!"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast or lunch. Reasonably priced, good service, fresh well made food. What more could you want."}
{"text":"I've been dragged to The Good Egg a few times and I still don't see what's the draw...  Their service is pretty good, I'll give them that.  The food is OK but nothing to boast about.  For the price I can get the same quality food at Denny's from much less.  I had two eggs over easy with sides of corn beef hash, fried potatoes and and english muffin.  The eggs were eggs... The hash was over cooked and so greasy they had to put it into another dish. The potatoes were bland and needed onions, herbs and seasoning.  The coffee was good and the orange juiced was great.

I will give this Good Egg some recognition for their patio.  It's the place to eat when your at this Good Egg."}
{"text":"Had an excellent breakfast at The Good Egg in Carefree AZ. My husband the Bananas Presley and said it was awesome. I enjoyed a fluffy and moist Spanish omelet. The staff here is friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"One would consider me a regular, frequented 6-8 times per month for the past 15 years.  Change is probably the most common denominator in the restaurant business and this is apparent at the First Watch/Good Egg.  I waited this morning for 15 minutes at my booth, extremely slow service, rude server, and if that is not enough, I asked the manager to follow up on my long ago ordered ice tea, she never pursued same.  Staff turnover is one thing but training is the solution.  It should be noted this is one of several occurrences over the past year of poor service,  this has become an exercise in food futility. The manager regrettably, does not manage.  Adios, Poor Egg."}
{"text":"Not the Good Egg any longer;  now First Watch Cafe (breakfast and lunch).  Food was good, hope it's better now!"}
{"text":"Service was fast and prompt however we all left feeling the food was nothing special potatoes were cold and I am not sure if the omelets were actually cooked in house tasted premade and warmed up in a microwave. I had a professional chef with me and he agreed, there were no skillet cook marks on it and it seemed rubbery"}
{"text":"We have been eating breakfast here for years. It is absolutely one of the best breakfast restaurants in town. The service is outstanding, friendly atmosphere and reasonable waiting time. Make sure to arrive early on Sundays in the winter as it really gets busy around 9:00AM. If you like whole wheat pancakes you will not find any better than here. Beware the portion is huge. You may want to opt for the short stack if you have dinner plans."}
{"text":"Two stars because it was good three years ago and now it is 1 star. 15 minutes for waiter to get to our table.  Asked for water- 10 minutes.  Food came 30 minutes after we ordered.  Order was screwed up with- one side was missing, easy over eggs were hard.  We didn't have time to wait.  They gave us a discount but the service was just unacceptable. New decor is nice though."}
{"text":"When we lived in Arizona, this is the location we always went to.  Always great food...excellent, friendly service...and very accommodating for special requests for healthier eating!"}
{"text":"Danger, Will Robinson! The Good Egg does not at all serve *good* eggs ... they are PROCESSED!

When the bill for our food arrived, the restaurant charged a dollar extra for an omelette to be prepared only with egg whites. I asked why. \"Because it's more expensive for us,\" said the server.

\"How can removing the yolk be more expensive? Aren't you paying for the same egg either way?\"

\"Unless you order an actual fried egg, all of our egg dishes are prepared with a mix.\"

\"What do you mean, 'a mix?'\"

\"We buy pre-mixed eggs in a carton.\"

What in the WORLD!? 

It turns out that even if my aunt had ordered her omelette with the yolks (read: normally) it still would have been made from a processed egg product, manufactured in some unknown location by an unknown corporate agri-business conglomerate.

The menu does not disclose any of this. If it did, business would drop like a rock.

The manager corroborated the server, that egg-whites only actually cost their company MORE money than if they cracked open fresh eggs themselves. 

First, why would a company named The *Good* Egg use anything but actual and real eggs in ANY dish? (Whatever processed egg-ish product they are using certainly includes preservatives and God knows what else.) Second, if their processed egg product is indeed more costly, why is it their preference? As a business person, I will say out loud right here and now that the people in the restaurant are mistaken ... if the oh-so-important egg-ish stuff The Not-So-Good Egg pours on a fry griddle is so damned excellent then, well, the truth is that the only reason for this strictly business decision is that the product costs less, not more.

My family has been a customer of this chain - and this specific restaurant - for 15 years, and this not-fresh egg issue came as news to us. 

We were not offered a discount when paying for our four meals. The server and manager both told us that next time we are in we will know to ask for our dishes to be prepared with actual eggs. There will not be a next time."}
{"text":"Good eggs.
Good french toast.
Good chorizo n' egg scramble.
Good cinnamon roll.
Good service.
Good patio shade.
Good price.
Good choice."}
{"text":"This place gets the four stars because of the patio.  What a GORGEOUS patio to sit at in November.

Food is pretty good... average I guess, but I'm not much of a breakfast person.  I had the Bacado omelette (bacon and avocado) and it wasn't bad, but nothing special.  Now... the potatoes that come with it... I LOVED those.  Love the seasoning.

Service was not bad... server kinda ditzy paired with my friend's dry humor... recipe for humiliation, but otherwise good."}
{"text":"Very nice breakfast place. All the food was delicious, simply a great place for breakfast! :)"}
{"text":"I love The Good Egg and especially this location. Ever since Melissa became the manager, it has gotten even better.  The food and service is always consistent for my family and I.  They have an extensive menu of traditional American breakfast choices in addition to healthy options for the health conscious.  When you get sick of being served dessert for breakfast (aka PanCAKES), give this Good Egg location a try."}
{"text":"I come here every Tuesday when I work in cave creek. Love the lunch special soup, salad and sandwich for $6.99.     The only thing that bothers me is that I come here every Tuesday for lunch by myself and the staff is always different except the manager.... Who doesn't remember me"}
{"text":"Stopped here on our vacation to grab breakfast. Delicious food. I recommend the bacato. Table behind us just got comped their plate because of a small mess up and forgetting havarti cheese. Great customer service and very kind staff."}
{"text":"Excellent meal; prompt service and lovely patio to dine on.  My husband had a hearty breakfast of two fried eggs, bacon, home fries and English muffin.  His meal, though standard fare, was delicious!  It arrived hot, with crisp bacon and non-soggy muffins.  My granola pancakes came with fresh strawberries and what appeared to be Maine wild blueberries- small, tender and flavorful.  I opted out of the \"vanilla cheesecake\" topping, but paid extra ($1.28) for real maple syrup.  Worth the price!  I would highly recommend this breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"It's lost most of its charm. Food was fine. Service was fine. The changes to the interior look fantastic."}
{"text":"I love The Good Egg.

Of course, I am a breakfast person---breakfast, lunch and dinner!  What could be better than something created from the incredible, edible egg?

This is the only Good Egg I have eaten at.  Everyone who works here is super nice and knows their job.  The hostess is VERY nice.  

Normally I get the always delicious and incredibly filling Huevos Ranchero's, but the other day I opted for the Florentine Benedict with fruit on the side.  I asked our server what kind of fruit and he said a variety of melons and grapes...  I HATE melon!  Why does everybody fill their fruit cups with melons?  So I asked him if I could mostly have grapes in my fruit cup and he hesitated, and then said sure.  So my Florentine Benedict arrived.  Omg, it was so good!  Perfectly poached eggs, grilled mushroom, onions, tomato and spinach, with little chunks of bacon and a nice Hollandaise, all piled on a nicely toasted English muffin.  And I got a side bowl of nuthin' but grapes!  Perfecto!

We ate on the patio, it was really nice, except for this stupid fly that took a liking to me and my meal.  There were some big birds watching us avidly, but the staff is pretty much on top of it, clearing dishes asap, so those winged rats are out of luck.  I liked that they brought me my iced tea in a plastic take-away cup.  I had drink to...take away!  I think I'll ask for a take-away cup always, in the future.  (Unless I get coffee.)  

I have filled up my Good Egg card and earned a free entree, and have started a new card.  Life is good.  Ahhh...life in Cave Creek-Carefree....it's EGG-zactly how life should be!"}
{"text":"What can I say? They are very reasonably priced and the service fast and efficient. I was suffering a particularly painful hangover after a long night of drinking and revelry. A quick brekky here put me on the road to recovery. 

Truth be told, the quality falls below iHop and is more on the level of Denny's but on the morning of my visit I can honestly say that I don't think I would have made it back to CenPho if I hadn't stopped here."}
{"text":"This is the best breakfast spot in Carefree. Two words: breakfast tacos. Love love love all the friendly staff and vast menu offerings. Mel is a gem and I always leave here with a smile on my face. The new facelift to the brand is fresh and modern. Now if only they would complete the update with the ceilings."}
{"text":"This place is ALWAYS busy, so I figured the food must be good. It turns out it is! VEGANS are welcome and the staff and chefs were very accommodating to my diet. I had the veggie skillet minus the eggs and cheese that originally comes with the dish as well as sourdough bread instead of the English muffin. Tasty and filling!"}
{"text":"The best breakfast place in the area! They have plenty of healthy options and will happily modify any item to suit your tastes. The pancakes are enormous and delicious, especially the blueberry and the seasonal pumpkin pecan. The Monterey and the pancakes are my favorites, but you really can't go wrong with anything on their menu. Each meal is cooked to perfection and the service is eggcellent! 

It is hard to think of a better way to start the day than by having breakfast at The Good Egg. The eggs are indeed good, as is everything else!"}
{"text":"Oh em gee!! This place if fabulous! I wanted everything on the menu!! They have a seasonal menu too! I got amazing food both times I went, as did my husband. Even something as simple as pancakes were exquisite! The service was also wonderful! Our servers both times were attentive and very friendly! Would go back again (already did). Don't miss out!!"}
{"text":"Servers here are very nice and personable.  I'm the type of person who needs that in the morning.  The patio is very nice and I think that's a big part of why this place is so popular.  My parents love the pancakes and french toast.  I thought the huevos rancheros were very good.  The restaurant is very clean and their cooking seems to have a a great home cooked feel that people love.  The service was also quick even when it was busy.  The prices may seem about a dollar higher than you might be used to, but they have a free customer loyalty card that is a good deal."}
{"text":"Just had the Sunday morning special today which was Peach Cobbler pancakes with ice cream and granola.  What a treat.  Absolutely delicious and others who were dining and saw my choice were all commenting and smiling.  Try it for yourself. Great service and a wonderful friendly place."}
{"text":"Big upgrade since they changed to a new format several months ago.  The food is fresh and healthy and the atmosphere is much nicer than it used to be.  Now one of our \"go to\" places for breakfast and lunch."}
{"text":"My parents love this place, and I think it's only because their baseline is NJ diners, of which is this is definitely a cut above.

When I come here with them while visiting, I know what I'm having before I walk in - an egg skillet breakfast. They aren't as good as Le Peep's, but this is much closer to my parents than Le Peep, so I end up here much more often.

General menu looks very similar to diner offerings, with a bunch of Le Peep-ish touches that I consider a cut above diner food.

They offer an additional coffee to go when one orders coffee, which is a good deal especially if you're the thrifty kind and have a second person who only wants a single cup of coffee, and have a punch card of buy 5 entrees, get 1 free which is good for repeat customer savings.

I'm not really a breakfast person, but if I were looking for breakfast on my own, I would take this any day over Denny's, although it gets crowded on weekend mornings when the weather is nice and there's no way I'd consider it worth it to wait here to eat breakfast.

3 1/2 rounded down."}
{"text":"Such a great little breakfast spot! We were in town for the weekend and came here both Saturday and Sunday! The food was excellent and the entire staff was friendly!"}
{"text":"This used to be a go to for weekend quick breakfast. The service was awful, took forever, food was not correct, unhappy staff and not dog friendly anymore."}
{"text":"Love the new menu. The staff are all so nice and friendly. Plus all the food is absolutely amazing!! I wish I could go everyday!!"}
{"text":"Good Egg has gone \"corporate \" and they have lost me ...probably permanently.  Whenever the bean counters take over, the customer  (BTW we pay the bills!) loses. 

A less than complete list of disappointments  would include :

1.  hard to read menu
2.  most menu items are overpriced 
3. Have ro ask for ice when ordering water.
4.  butter provided with pancakes very inadequate 
5. high turnover in servers. Their longest time server, left recently.   She was the best and probably tossed her hands in the air after all the \"improvements \"
6. less than friendly environment.
7. to go cups about 50% smaller than they used to be.

Are the bean counters responsible for all this?  This surely would be the case directly  for many of the above; their \"desires \" probably has had an effect on the rest. 

Although the business deserves a 2 in my mind,  there are two mitigating things that got me to a reluctant 3.  They have remodeled the inside so it looks a lot nicer and  more contemporary. 

Saddest thing of all is that this used to be one of my favorite restaurants.   Gave them high marks on Yelp and used to direct and/or take people here.   No mo!

There are many far better places near here.  Check them out."}
{"text":"This place has been around for what seems like forever. It is super easy to find and is actually pretty big inside. The decor is outdated but goes along with the theme of the whole place. Which is breakfast. The prices are cheap which is good and the food is a-okay. I've had my fair share of bad choices but overall the place is pretty good. It is also good for huge groups and kids."}
{"text":"Best Breakfast, best price!  Tasty options of diner versus southwest fare.  Location is beautiful looking up at Black Mountain.  Crowded as you can imagine but the servers are friendly and the food is fresh.  Stop at off times if you want quick seating.  Wish they were open for dinner for those late night breakfast cravings."}
{"text":"They took my favorite items off their menu but the food is still good. We sat on the patio where many birds picked food off plates. I found it interesting to watch but others found it unnerving having birds dive bomb you while you eat. The staff definitely needs to be instructed to remove plates more quickly. The birds swarm a table when people leave."}
{"text":"Pancakes good.  Mexican style entrees not so great - mine had cold components such as the black beans, and that's a major turnoff when going out for a hot breakfast.  Orange juice is quite tasty.  Service is so-so.  Patio is nice, but this location is very buy during prime hours on weekends."}
