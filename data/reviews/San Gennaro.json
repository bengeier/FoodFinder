{"text":"This charming café serves portions of pizza from the kitchen of Bottega next door along with delicious Italian pastries and, of course, good coffee. The service is excellent -- notably from the guy who seems also to be the manager. One of my favourite Little Italy spots."}
{"text":"Let's start with the good:     It's a really cute place. we came here on a Saturday afternoon around 5pm and there was nobody in the restaurant. They serve both pizzas as well as italian desserts. The service was great, the guys were really extremely friendly and helpful.   The bad:     The Pizzas. I'm not sure if it was because i had super high expectations or we came at the end of the day, but the pizzas really weren't all that memorable. we had the margarita pizza & the sausage pizza and both were average. Usually I'm a huge fan of margarita, but this one i couldn't even finish. It was very dry and non-impressive.   I didn't try any of the desserts so i might come back and give those a chance !"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, delicious pizza, warm and friendly staff. One of my favourite places to stop for lunch in Little Italy."}
{"text":"Adorable place.   Haven't tried the coffee yet but stop here for lunch for pizza & pastries. You can also get ice cream, and there are a few shelves of pantry goods you can buy on your way out."}
{"text":"Had read about this place online, and how they served Roman style pizza the roman way- by the weight. But we headed over on a hot afternoon and had no choice but to try the authentic looking gelato instead (no fluorescent colours here)! Oh mamma! That was the best choice of our day. The gelato had a beautiful, silky consistency and was not too dense, and was much cheaper than many of the not-so-good Montreal gelatos we have tried since moving here 5 years ago. Had both the chocolate and hazelnut flavours. It immediately brought us back to our trip to Rome, eating fresh gelato in the narrow streets late in the night. I would highly recommend trying this place! I cannot wait to go back and try the pizza (many vegetarian options, all fresh) as well as the delicious looking pastries (I saw nutella in many)."}
{"text":"Best espresso I've had in a long time. Homemade ice cream reminds me of Italy :-). Their pizza al taglio is delicious. You can't go wrong with anything you choose here. Terrace is very nice. Great for hanging out and enjoying great weather..."}
{"text":"Pastries and snacks, cute and inexpensive. Large terrace in summer, excellent coffee year round."}
{"text":"I went in for a quick bite as I was stranded in the valley of the shadow of hunger caused by two awkwardly-scheduled meals.   The Margherita pizza had an authentic Roman feel to it - both in taste and texture. The size and price were very reasonable.   In terms of setting, I enjoyed the light, familiar ambiance were the barista seems to know most patrons, who have all the reasons in the world to go back again and again.  I have not tried their coffee, but it looks (and smells) very promising.   In short: two thumbs up."}
{"text":"stumbled on this cafe when taking a trip through little italy. My wife only wanted a tea but what we found was A LOT more.  They make a whole bunch of stuff in here. Eveything from sweet stuff to also savory food.  They make a variety of square pizza's and they were mostly delicious. The breakfast pizza was my favorite. It had a sunny side egg on it and some other seasoning.  We tried the potato one which was also good. Ironically enough, our least favorite was the margarita square which was a little bland.  They have a glass window where you can see the pizza maker working his magic. Very cool!  The nutella filled donut was also awesome. It had a great soft texture with the creamy nutella. Solid!!  Definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"If you dare to try a nutella-filled beignet, just know all predecessors you'll ever taste after delighting in this symphony of masterful taste, will be a total, utter, massive disappointment. Others may dare, but they will never compare. Try it. Why? BECAUSE YOU'RE WORTH IT."}
{"text":"Mon cur a chaviré à la vue de ce beau comptoir rempli de douceurs italiennes. Nous somme venus pour la semaine de la pizza et nous avons aussi succombé aux charmes des bonnes pâtisseries.  Le patron nous l'a expliqué : ici, on sert de la pizza dans le style romaine! Les goûts sont divers et originaux (choux fleurs marinés à l'uf pimenté), la pâte est épaisse mais tellement moelleuse et surtout, caractéristique principale, ce sont des parts rectangulaires et non pas des pizza complètes. Ce qui permet de pouvoir en goûter plusieurs, ce que nous avons fait bien entendu! Elles étaient toutes très bonnes ;) Au niveau du dessert il y a des choix très bon. Le migliaccio est très bon (sorte de gâteau au fromage italien), les beignes fourrés sont succulente et que dire de leurs glaces maison. Celle au basilic et citron est extraordinaire !   Le service est particulièrement agréable, le patron est un connaisseur de bonnes places et nous avons échangés des bonnes adresses :)  Tous est frais et de qualité dans ce restaurant, je ne peux que vous le recommander et je trouve de plus les prix intéressant ! Je retournerais de sur :)"}
{"text":"My new all the time craving. Yesterday I picked up a bunch of pieces of pizza for a picnic in the woods. We ate them not heated up or anything, a sausage and peppers one, one with mushrooms and ham, one with potatoes rosemary and cheese, they were all just crazy good. The pizza dough so fluffy and chewy and crispy; the sauce so perfectly plum tomato-y savoury and gorgeous.   I've picked up a couple different kinds of baked goods here and they were all incredible as well, the best one was a kind of fig and pecan buttery upside down mini cake that I'm sad isn't here with me now.   If you're into Italian coffee this is a great spot too, I had an awesome cortado sitting in the window with my book watching St Zotique go by. No filter coffee, none of that third wave single source coffee stuff, but very excellent Italian mellow roast which sometimes is just what you need."}
{"text":"It was a good cafe.  Went in to try their specialty pizza, the waitress recommended the onion with sausage flavour, it wasn't bad but didn't impress me.  The \"donut\" with Nutella was overly sweet, but the dough was quite tasty."}
{"text":"I tried their pastry cream bomboloni on a quest to find a replacement for the best ones I ever had in London (have not tried them in Italy). The donut in itself was good if a little heavier than I would like but there was very little filling though it was excellent. A bit pricey for the small size. They offer a choice of pizzas and baked goods as well as gelato and a there are a few table to sit down and enjoy a cup of coffee."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place while looking for a place to wait for our Airbnb check in. Everyone was so friendly! We had a large luggage and a puppy and were warmly welcomed. Someone even brought him a tub of water.   Had the pizza (super delicious !!), quiche, donut, and a specialty dessert (forgot the name), and several espresso drinks. Everything was yummy and the service was truly outstanding. Also the interior decor is lovely - clean modern lines with lots of natural sunlight. Great place to catch up with friends, get some work done, (or wait for 4 hours for your Airbnb..), etc."}
{"text":"Thank you San Gennaro for starting off my Pizza Week 2015 on a high note!  From the moment I walked in and heard soulful blues licks on the radio, I knew it was going to be a good experience.  San Gennaro isn't making an entire pizza as their special for Pizza Week, instead they specialize in Pizza al taglio, or pizza baked in a rectangular tray and sold in slices. For Pizza Week, they're offering a roasted cauliflower pizza, using both white and purple cauliflower, sprinkled with paprika and grated parmesan, lemon zest, and a little parsley.  While it's not my favourite combination of toppings, in the spirit I ordered one piece, and also tried the Breakfast Pizza (eggs, fior di latte mozzarella, cherry tomato, and basil), as well as the marinated vegetable pizza (zucchini, eggplant, and peppers).  I immediately noticed that San Gennaro doesn't use a standard pizza dough, it's more crunchy and crumbly-feeling.  The dough is an important part of the flavour of the pizza here, unlike other places it has a distinct flavour and adds to the overall experience.  I found the special pizza to be a bit too \"busy\", I couldn't really enjoy all the different components, a few were drowned out.  That's not to say it didn't taste good, just that I felt it's perhaps too ambitious. I really liked the Breakfast Pizza however, and I'm looking forward to finishing the vegetable pizza later on.  I tried an imported Chinotto soda as an accompaniment (think Brio, but better :) ), and finished off with a small plate of bombolones, an Italian fried donut sort of pastry, filled with vanilla cream or Nutella (I had both!).  The bombolones were pretty awesome, if you like sugar (check!), pastry (check!), things that taste good (double check!), and don't forget sugar (check!).  The staff were very welcoming and eager to answer all my questions.  I really enjoyed the ambiance and the experience, and I think you will too!"}
{"text":"Le service est impeccable! Le café latté que j'ai pris était bon, mais grosse déception pour le croissant (sec)  pourtant ce n'est pas la première fois que j'y vais ( justement parce que je trouvais que les croissants était bon). Dommage."}
{"text":"When I heard that the people behind Bottega were opening up another spot specializing in pizza al taglio I was excited since their pizza is the best in the city in my opinion.  They also have a wide variety of italian pastries for sale as well as gelato.  There isn't that much seating but in warmer months there is a nice street terrasse.  The pizza is quite good.  I had a vegetarian one, as well as one with cheese, sausage and potatoes.  The vegetarian one was my favourite by far.  I wasn't too crazy about the potato on the other one but it was still enjoyable. I finished it off with a migliaccio which is a type of cheesecake made with ricotta.  It was a little on the dry side but I did like the combination of lemon and ricotta.  Pricewise it's worth every penny.  My whole meal cost me $15 and that included a gazzosa along with the food that I had bought.  It was in line with what I was expecting to pay and the quality of the product was very high.  Customer service was another big plus and it was very good here.  San Gennaro is definitely worth the trip if you're in the Little Italy neighbourhood and I will definitely be back to try more of their offerings."}
{"text":"Pizza was okay, not super impressed, it was kind of cold and average. I had a pastry filled with custard, now that was purely indulgent and delicious. But, what was really off the charts, and what you should definitely try before leaving it's the Basil gelatto, holy maccaroni, it was amazing. I love basil and I have tried basil ice-cream before, but this one was just exquisite. Forget the pizza and just buy two scoops of that!"}
{"text":"J'ai visité ce café aujourd'hui et j'ai bien aimé! J'ai dégusté un latte et un canoli, le meilleur que j'ai mangé de ma vie!!! Toute en douceur et en légèreté, je ferais un détour pour en remanger. Malheureusement, au niveau des pizzas, il y a eu une erreur dans notre commande alors nous n'avons pas goûté celles que nous voulions. Celle qu'on nous a servie était correcte, sans plus. J'ai trouvé la pâte trop épaisse et qu'il y avait beaucoup trop d'ingrédients sur la pizza. Il faisait un beau soleil alors nous nous sommes installés sur la terrasse et c'était très agréable! Je goûterai certainement aux pizzas à nouveau, en allant chercher des canolis!"}
{"text":"Service rapide et courtois. La nourriture est délicieuse. J'ai pris l'aranccini et un morceau de pizza. La terrasse du Bottega est disponible sur le lunch. C'est super rapide alors c'est un arrêt parfait pour un midi rapide!"}
{"text":"There is a certain vibe I love about Little Italy in Montreal. The real communal vibe - the way people seem to just come together to sit and enjoy a coffee and a chat. The little cafes and shops around that area cater to that really well. I don't visit the area as much anymore but when I do, I really try to enjoy that experience. San Gennaro on St-Zotique is a place I have heard much about since it opened a few years ago now. A hybrid pizzeria, bakery, coffee shop, grocery and gelato shop, it tries to cover lots of ground but given its heritage - San Gennaro was started by the same group that gave us restaurants Bottega and Hosteria in Little Italy - it definitely has a good chance.  First up, I tried one of their arancinis. A solid version all-around. There was a nice crunch on the exterior and the interior is a great mix of veal, green peas, mozzarella and parmigiano. Nothing to complain about here.  But truthfully, we are here to talk about their pizza. Coming from the group that brought us Bottega pizza just next door, there are certainly expectations even if we are dealing with Pizza al Taglio, not the napoletana-style they serve at Bottega. Pizza al taglio is baked in large rectangular trays and served by the slice. As such, crust-wise, we are not talking about thin-crust anymore. This is a thicker, more chewy pizza - the common version we have all had would be the tomato pizza often served in buffets or at children's parties. Thankfully, this is much better than that. This pizza has a great crunch to its crust while still being nice and chewy.  I tried a host of different pizzas over a few visits. The first one was a potato and andouille sausage pizza. The inclusion of potato was something I had never tried before. It makes the pizza a little more dense and a little drier especially without any tomato sauce. The real kicker though was the sausage whose spiciness really came out.  I then tried the standard Margherita pizza. Their tomato sauce has a nice smoothness to it and a nice sweetness but acidic taste. Top it with some mozzarella and you have a solid classic. On a follow-up visit, I tried the same pizza but with salami added to it. Same great taste with some meaty goodness.  A more unique offering is their breakfast pizza. Topped with a egg, some cherry tomatoes and some pork salume, you have a nice mixture of the richness and spiciness. The egg is cooked just enough to not leak all over the pizza which makes it easier to enjoy as a single slice. A nice change-up for a morning snack.  The final one I tried was another potato pizza - this time without the sausage, just with some smoked cheese. I was curious how the potato would work without the spicy sausage. Another hit - the smoked cheese created just enough of a contrast with the potato to help lighten the feeling.  As I was sitting outside of the terrasse on my last visit, I couldn't help but observe the table of elderly Italian men visiting there simply having a coffee and chatting. Their level of comfort on the terrasse chatting with the waitress as she passed by as they were enjoying the weather. It speaks to how San Gennaro has fit into the neighbourhood and the vibe they have achieved. Good food, a nice atmosphere and a great terrasse - all a good combination for when you are passing by Little Italy.   Cheers!"}
