{"text":"I moved to the area from Toronto's beach neighborhood where I used to frequent an awesome little bakery called life is sweet. Their cupcakes were made with the best ingredients and it was evident when you took your first bite. I went to coco's for the first time recently expecting a similar experience. I was sorely disappointed. It's like they are trying to cash in on the cupcake craze,  one box of betty crocker at a time. There are no creative flavors or decorations, one cupcake I got was topped with a cheap gummy but we tried it anyway. So disappointing. Word of advice to the Baker-please unleash your creativity that compelled you to open the shop. I would love to rave about a bakery in the suburbs."}
{"text":"From birthday cakes to our baby shower, and the many cupcake orders,very tasty and would recommend to anyone......."}
{"text":"Coco Cake Co is our go-to bakery in Durham region because they make the cutest, most flavourful and adorable cupcakes.  It is owned by Massey's restaurant and the owners are always creating beautiful wedding, birthday and other special occasion cakes.   We have tried many flavours, which change on weekly basis. Some of our favourites include:  Maple Bacon, Chocolate coconut, Double chocolate, Peanut butter chocolate, and Cherry Cheesecake.  Costs are $2.50 each or $2.25 for more than 6. Definitely worth it!  Coco Cake also makes a delicious coconut cream pie if cupcakes are not your suit."}
{"text":"Went there last minute as a bday emergency change of mind lol. Wasn't sure how they'd be as they were reg smallish sized . I took my chance and jumped into 8 variety of flavors . They were a hit and I'll be back .I will ask for a full list of all they do next time for sure .  Great jobs lady's!!!"}
{"text":"Omg these cupcakes are to die for!!!  Stopped in early Friday afternoon for a few cupcakes, the place itself is clean and tiny but turns out fantastic cakes & cupcakes! There are 8 flavours to choose from, which may change daily. We got: Chocolate, Vanilla, Coconut, Peanut Butter Chocolate, Cherry Cheesecake, Cookies 'n Cream. You can taste the quality & freshness in each bite, it really makes the supermarket desserts pale in comparison when you taste fresh peanut butter, or real vanilla bean in your cupcake. Will absolutely return and highly recommend it to anyone out in the East end (it is right at the Scarborough/Pickering border). PS. Worth breaking your diet for!!! $2.50 per cupcake or 6 for $13.50"}
{"text":"It's hard not to give this place more as their customer service was great - one of the best for cupcake shops.  But unfortunately I found their actual cupcake very dense, thick and heavy. I prefer a fluffier type. Just preference for cupcakes.   Very cute shop, only tried cupcakes."}
{"text":"Ordered a custom cake for my Mom whose birthday falls on Christmas Day. The cake was absolutely beautiful and incredibly delicious! Vanilla cake with mango filling and you could definitely taste the real mango. Great texture and simply tasty. My mom was absolutely thrilled and the cake has even held up moist and delicious several days later. Can legitimately say this is one of the best cakes we ever tasted and I've ordered custom cakes from many other places before.   We did pay good money for this cake but the quality was outstanding with great professional service. Highly recommend! Thank you Tianna and Coco Cake for making my mom super happy!"}
{"text":"Tucked way back in the plaza behind Massey's.  I saw the whoopie pies and they looked really yummy so I just had to try them. At $4 each they are pretty pricy. My personal opinion, the whoopie was nothing special. Reminded me of eating a Jos Louis which are readily available at most super markets at a fraction of the price. Just a more dense version of a Jos Louis.  The cupcakes on the other hand were oh so amazing! Very moist and fluffy. The icing was like butter and not your typical icing. One of the best cupcakes I have had at $3."}
{"text":"Cute little quaint shop with a mother daughter duo owns the shop. Each week they have different cupcake flavours. The daughter was really nice and was very helpful describing the flavours and ingredients of what was in the cupcakes.   I was happy with the level of sweetness for the cupcakes. Most places I go to the frosting is too sweet but the flavour was perfect. I was especially impressed with the mocha flavour!   I would happily refer others to this little cupcake shop. For someone who isn't very fond of desserts, it is great to find a guilty pleasure."}
{"text":"The cupcakes are a bit smaller than most gourmet shops. They are $2.00 plus each.    Its a walk-in shop. No more than 4 people can walk in at once. Really its just a place with a tall display of cupcakes and a cash register.  Other than that, they are baking and designing made-to-order cakes out front.  If youre walking in, you can buy cupcakes, whoopie pies, shortbread cookies, chocolate chip and sugar cookies.  I bought two whoopie pies and 4 cupcakes. It cost me $17.00 and change.     The flavors change every 5 days.  The taste is hit and miss. The icing texture sometimes differs between cupcakes too.  Sometimes the flavor might blow your mind, like Chocolate....and other times not so much. I had chocolate hazelnut once and mango another time, but I didnt taste like those flavors at all.   *They should taste the icing to make sure it really does taste like that flavor first*  Because of the miss on the flavors, I wouldn't order a batch.Other than that, they do a great job on the cupcake mix.  I love the whoopie pies. I personally would visit just for that!"}
{"text":"After moving from the danforth to Pickering (temporarily), we set out to find a cupcake place that would satisfy our leslieville cupcake habit. We found Coco Cakes through a yelp search and we are happy we did!    At first we drove right past the shop because it's situated behind a restaurant off of a small street. A bigger cupcake sign or a sandwich board sign might grab more attention from the road. This cute lil' shop has a open concept kitchen so you can see everything going on behind the scenes. There is a nice glass display where the cupcakes are kept----which I like because there's less chance of flies, dust and whatever getting on them.   We ordered 6 cupcakes-- cherry cheesecake, peanut butter chocolate (2 of them), red velvet, toasted coconut and cookies and cream. All of them were delicious! The cream cheese icing on the cherry cheesecake, peanut butter and red velvet was smooth and had a great balance of cream cheese, icing sugar and butter. The only complaint that I have was that the cherry cheesecake cake part was a little dry.   Overall, good cupcakes, a lil' under the deliciousness of leslieville, but it hit the spot! A 3.5 star!!!"}
{"text":"I almost missed Coco Cake Co!! It is a little shop behind Massey's and you won't see it when you driving along Liverpool Road...  Open Kitchen concept.. with chic deco... really a takeout place, so there are not seatings....  There were couple of  different flavours when I dropped in on this Thursday afternoon: Vanilla, Double Chocolate, Coconut, Cookies 'n Cream and  Chocolate Mango ($2.50) - The base itself is moist and rich... and I can see real bits of dark chocolate inside - The light mango frosting has just the right sweetness....  I should have get all the flavours...and I think I can eat 6 of those in one seating with NO problem!!"}
{"text":"When you walk into this shop you are immediately struck by the sweet wafting aromas of freshly baked cakes and icing. The store itself is very tiny. It's a mother and daughter run business and they sell a few cupcakes and cookies upfront but predominantly do custom order cakes. No seating here just standing room literally you could awkwardly stand 4 people into this tiny area. To the right of the entrance are the cupcakes displayed for sale in a tall glass case. They have 8 flavours available that change weekly (check there facebook page to see). To the right of the display is the cashier counter where they have decorated sugar cookies and giant wedges of shortbread cookies individually packaged for sale. Behind the counter are  beautiful displays of custom cakes and current cakes they are working on.  Of course I was here to grab some cupcakes. However by 2pm they were already sold out of 4 of the 8 flavours for day. I was told they only bake a certain amount for the day so once it's gone that's it.  These are the flavours I got:  Vanilla cupcake - I found the cake to be quite dense for a cupcake and not particularly outstanding in flavour. The icing was good though sweet vanilla and very thick.  Toasted Coconut Cupcake - This cupcake texture was lighter than vanilla one but still on the dense side for a cake and was also vanilla flavoured. The frosting nailed the toasted coconut flavour and would definitely be a hit for a coconut lover.  Red Velvet Cupcake - One of my favourites! This cake was much lighter and fluffier and what I prefer in a cupcake with a mild cocoa taste and not too sweet. The cream cheese frosting was sooo good though!!! Fluffy and smooth with that tangy cream cheese taste and a good balance of sweet vanilla flavouring.  Cookies and Cream Cupcake - This one was also very good. The chocolate cake was soo light and fluffy on this one which was surprising as chocolate cakes tend to be denser. It had a light chocolate flavour that wasn't too sweet. The frosting on this was also incredibly good. Nice and fluffly and tasted just like the inside of an oreo.  I also had to grab one of the individually wrapped Sugar cookies as it was too cute to pass up. A classic sugar cookie topped with pink royal icing and a red fondant heart was as scrumptious as it looked. A lovely sweet and soft sugar cookie with a delightful vanilla flavoured icing was also a hit.  Overall I have to say the varying textures of cakes was quite surprising but they have all the frostings nailed! The cupcakes however are on the smaller side and I was disappointed that so many of the flavours were already sold out so early in the day but I guess that's a sign of how good they are. They're custom cakes look incredible and by all the in progress cakes they were working on I'd give them my business if in need. I love supporting little family run local shops so I'll be back to try some more flavours."}
