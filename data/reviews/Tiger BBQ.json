{"text":"I'm terribly disappointed at the quality of its takeout seafood chew mien. There's barely anything in there except for oil, salt and noodles. I dug through the pile of noodles, and I could only find 2 teeny tiny baby shrimps and a handful of pathetic squid tentacles, literally 1 CM each. 
It costed me 7.99+ tax. 
Who would want a meal like that?!"}
{"text":"This place is a great alternative to a place like Yang's BBQ. Compared to Yang's they are less busy, so there is usually no wait time and less smoky interior. The food quality is not the same as Tiger seems to use spice that is somewhat different in flavour. Tiger has dishes made with fresh fish but comes with a price, roughly $20-30 each. 
Whenever I come here they only give me a checkoff list for menu selections written in Chinese. I can read it but I wonder if it is available in English."}
{"text":"This place is a traditional Sichuan place that offers Sichuab boiled fish, kebabs including meats and vegetable variety, and my favourite glass noodles.  The decor is so-so, as I usually wouldn't walk into a place that does not look extremely clean.  The place just have a greasy feel to it, and I think this maybe due to the food they serve here.  

The kebabs were good, but they were not spectular with a pop of cumin flavour which I love on lamb Kebaba.  The beef kebabs were really tasty with really fresh spices and meaty flavours.  As for the chicken soft bones kebabs, they were well seasoned with a slight hint of sweetness.  The cabbage kebabs were excellent though.  My favourite would be the Sichuan boiled fish with the wonderful spicy aroma from the herbs and spices.  It tasted delicious; however, I would prefer the fish bones to be taken out of the fish before it is cooked.  There were like a lot of bones that I have to pick up which is not something I like to do when I am eating.  The dishes were a little pricey for the quality also.  I was with 3 other freinds and it was around $30 per person.  

I love this style of food and I feel this place has a lot of  potential to be excellent.  All in all, I might return to this place if I am craving for the spicy fiah dish as I really love the flavours and also for the cabbage kebabs.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times, delicious bbq lamb skewers. They have all kinds of spicy bbq selections. Such as lamb, beef, chicken, intestines and such. Personally I like their grill cabbage. It was not salty like other places. Great place to have some beer and gather with friends for dinner or late-night meal. Cleanliness and service were okay, didn't expect too much from them. But the food was on point and price is decent."}
{"text":"Best place for skewers in Scarborough. Great food, good pricing, open till late. Come give it a try if you haven't. Beware of beef tendons though, that thing will kill you."}
{"text":"A solid 4 star... maybe even 4.5 because the food is still very much affordable and spiced just right. 

I've been to several places that serve the lamb and beef skewers. Most places overload on the spices making it extra spicy, but this place does it just right! Just enough heat so it's enjoyable, and not overly salty so you don't suffer from dry mouth the rest of the night.

The prices for the lamb & beef skewers are prices at $4.99 for 4.  My other favorite dishes are the \"home made potato chips\" with spice ($3.99), and the cold noodle dish that's served with peanut sauce ($7.99)

My go-to place for skewers in Scarborough."}
{"text":"Update: the beef skewers are now distinctly better than the lamb skewers. Also tried the chicken, which was pretty good but super bony.

I've been sufficiently impressed enough to bump it from a 3 to a 4 star, although it's a low 4...

Stay away from the beef tendon unless you want to prank a friend?!"}
{"text":"?????????????????????brampton?tiger???????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"From the outside, this place may not look impressive, but they do serve good food! 
After having dinner near this area, we quickly stopped by for savory snacks instead of desserts. Lamb skewers were seasoned well and overall very authentic and delicious food. Because we were too full from dinner, we did not get to order a lot. I will definitely go back to try different items from the menu!"}
{"text":"Nothing fancy, it's not the biggest place but they do have great skewers and CHEAP beer. Service is fast and the place is open late! 

I wouldn't go out of the way for it - more of a place to chill"}
{"text":"I've checked in here 15 times, but I know I have been here way more times than that. I come here at least once a month now because the service is always good and the food quality always consistent.

We usually always order the Guo Ba Rou which is worth every dollar. It comes with a generous portion size.

Lamb skewers always delicious, no gamy taste.

Fried fish (4 pcs), another hit, just chew the head carefully.

Sliced spicy tofu sheets - this is how I could consider becoming a vegetarian.

Any of the potato dishes - sliced or fried, you can't go wrong.

TRY this place. Open late and everything I have tried so far is delicious.

I recently had the cold noodle soup, me gusta.

Prices are decent too."}
{"text":"Great place for Chinese Kabab, tried lots of different meats, I think the lamb kabab needs a little bit improvement, the rest are just excellent.
Definitely will come back."}
{"text":"7/1/15: This was one of our last meals in Canada, before taking off for home.  And omg, one of our best meals here!!!  My gf loves the spicy food from her hometown in China, and this stuff is some of the most authentic I have ever tasted anywhere in the Americas!  Its hole-in-the-wall looks and crappy location are probably holding this place back, but if you're looking for truly authentic food from the northern-China/Middle-eastern/Turkish region, this is it.  Sorry, I have no clue what this type of food is called, but just that it's what they serve in that area.  Skewers.  Spicy with lots of cumin.  Heavily influenced by Turkish and Middle Eastern food.  Yeah, have no clue what it's called, but it's really good stuff!

I'm really sad that there is no equivalent that we have ever found in California of this kind of food.  If there were, we'd probably hit it up every week!

1. Molson Canadian Lager Beer C$2.99: If you're gonna eat spicy skewered Asian food, you gotta have beer right!?  Well, we had yet to try Canadian beer, so here it is.  It was alright.  I don't remember it, for better or worse.  5/10.

2. #1 Lamb skewer [? I think] C$4.99:  This is the sht.  Exactly like it should be.  My gf makes this every time we do BBQ with friends.  Chewy, meaty, spicy, ultra heavy cumin.  Great.  Must get.  10/10.

3. #6 Beef skewer (4) fat [? I think] C$4.99:  Pretty much the same as the lamb skewer but with beef.  10/10.

4. #10 Aorta and beef skewer (4) C$5.99:  Well, this was a total first for me!  So excited to try something new!  In this case, the aorta (of heart) is kinda like calamari rings--very similar in taste and texture actually.  And they put some beef in the middle.  Looks odd.... and awesome!  Ha ha.... well, tastes badass too.  Same sweet and spicy mixture.  MUST TRY!  10/10

5. #22 BBQ quail C$3.99:  Surprisingly cheap.  I'm not the hugest fan of quail cause there's little meat, and in this case it's pretty much what I expected.  Not too meaty, but if you like quail, you'll like this.  6/10.

6. #40 BBQ fried tofu (2) C$2.99:  Not normally what I would get, but she wanted it.  And what do you know!--tastes awesome with that special hot sauce they use!  Glad I tasted another variation of tofu!  7/10.

7. #52 House special clear noodle in sauce C$7.99:  Unfortunately I don't remember much except that it was good.

8. #79 Preserved napa & pork belly hot wok [? I think] C$10.99:  I think this is a typical preparation of the dish.  Reminds me of my mom's cooking.  It's good with rich broth.  Not sure it's that special though.  7/10.

So, you've seen the previous reviews, of which there are only 3 at this time.  I doubt any of them are familiar with this type of food.  Heck, since I've NEVER seen this before in America, outside of my own gf's cooking, yeah I doubt there could be more than just a handful of people on this CONTINENT who know what this is!  Anyway........... if you're open to new experiences, this is a great place.  Very great.

Damn I wish they had one near SF.  I'm sure there would have been 1000+ Yelp reviews with stars through the roof!

5/5

{"text":"Tiger BBQ serves more than BBQ.. Any dish you think belongs to North Eastern China, you can find it here.

Of course a lot of the dishes can be quite spicy, the menu didn't mark any of those dish off with pepper symbol so proceed with caution. My waitress was nice enough to ask me if I can eat spicy after she took my order.

Lamb Skewers ($4.50) only comes in an order of 4 was delicious . A good mixture of fat and lean, the texture was tender. A good dash of spice... cough cough... 

Jello ($4.99) ???? Jello has a more doughy texture, the sauce is well balanced with soy sauce, peanut and hot sauce.

Menu is diverse including BBQ fish in hot pot and even BBQ whole rabbit and some exotic organs of cow talking about head to tail..

Cash Only!"}
{"text":"Taking away one star now. The food at least the ones I order are still good. But their quality of service has severely declined. 

Gone at the call buttons and what's left are two waitresses that are more focused on their tablet and smartphone respectively than the customers. 

The saving grace they have is the food I usually order which are. 

BBQ Lean beef skewers
BBQ beef fat skewers
BBQ lamb skewers
BBQ steamed bun
BBQ potato slices

I didn't have room for 

BBQ Corn

As before the spice they've put simply enhances the taste of the ingredients rather than masking things to the point they all taste the same. 

We did order something that was lacklustre. Their seafood fried rice didn't use old dried rice and what ends up happening is it tastes very bland that even adding some of the BBQ beef on it didn't bring it to an enjoyable level. 

So for future reference just stick with steam rice or have more BBQ steamed bun or even BBQ potato slices if we need to carbo load.

All in all the experience was enhanced by bringing a friend who has never been here. His comment would be that this is a place to go with drinking buddies to have a cold one."}
