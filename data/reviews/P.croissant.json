{"text":"I enjoy their food and I admit I haven't sampled a lot of their menu. To me the prices seem a little high for what you get, I would give them 4 stars if I felt the food quality was higher to justify some of the prices. The staff is always friendly though and the place is always clean."}
{"text":"Sad that I moved away from this place but always stop in when I'm in the area. I got a breakfast sandwich and a raspberry cream cheese one."}
{"text":"A lady at my old work used to bring these in for the office often.  A couple years later when I needed some breakfast items for a work meeting I decided to bring in P croissants. When I went to pick up my order at 6:30 in the morning I was reminded why small businesses are so great.  The gentleman behind the counter was so welcoming and cheerful while I was still half asleep.  He offered help out to the car and I was on my way.  They were such a hit at my work and everyone loved the decoder sheet.   And did I mention how amazing these croissants are!!!!"}
{"text":"Fresh croissants made daily! Amazing blended coffee and their Philly bastilly croissant sandwich was delicious and they were not stingy with their roast beef!! Love it! Service: WOW! They make you feel like a regular even if you are not! Second time here and excellent service. 4 stars bc they do run out of their baked goods, but hey if they are made daily, I can see why!"}
{"text":"Meh.   Had a serious jonesing for a great cinnamon roll, and this place popped up, so we thought we'd give it a try. Apparently they haven't made cinnamon rolls in quite some time.   While the breakfast sandwiches on croissants were good, they were nothing remarkable. As someone who loves a great flaky French pastry, I'd still take the ones from Essence any day of the week. These were closer in texture to the ones you get at Costco.  While there was nothing *bad* about it, this place had the opportunity to blow my skirt up, and instead I'm just left with...meh."}
{"text":"This place is great! Delicious croissants (breakfast and dessert) and fabulous customer service!"}
{"text":"Had a very light and flavorful breakfast today! We had the sausage, egg and cheese croissant  and a tomato florentine croissant. Both were delicious and we\"ll definitely be back. The croissants were so light and fluffy."}
{"text":"This bakery was super cute! I tried an apple cinnamon croissant and it was DELICIOUS! My friend got a salad and said it was amazing. I will definitely be going back to try more."}
{"text":"Service was great.  The Latte I ordered had a little too much milk in it for my liking.  I would suggest putting more ice in the cup or getting smaller cups.  Everything else was fantastic and the croissants were delicious.  I will be going back."}
{"text":"I love this place, or 'USED' to love this place. The croissants and the sandwiches here are very good, but I had a very very bad experience today. The customer service was worst. Me and my husband walk into the restaurant, firstly we get a cold reception and when I ask a few questions about the flavors, I do not get a response and all I get is a frown. I was patient and kept my cool. Then we ordered our food (2 croissants and 2 sandwiches, everything 'For here' nothing 'To go'). We finish eating our croissants and wait for the sandwiches to come to our table or at least our names called out, as others were called out when the order was ready. Then after a long wait, I see that from the kitchen comes an order in a brown bag and a box(to go). The person behind the counter looks at it and doesn't even care to bring it to our table, instead she takes it and keeps it on the counter. I am confused and don't understand what is going on and still waiting for my food to arrive. In the meantime I see that she is calling out names for other orders immediately coming out Of the kitchen. We kept waiting and waiting, there were not many people in the restaurant, so it was evident that the order was ours, but nothing happens. Then I called this lady and ask her if that food sitting on the counter for the past 10 minutes was ours and she is very confused. She doesn't even remember our order and then she brings that stale food to us. Just after this, she goes to another table and gives the food (to go order) immediately which comes out of the kitchen. I also see her greeting another couple and talking to them with a smiling face for about 5 mins. That was very very rude and unacceptable behavior. Not sure what she was thinking and doing. WE ARE NOT GOING BACK TO THIS PLACE. That is for sure. SORRY P.CROISSANT, YOU JUST LOST A REGULAR CUSTOMER DUE TO UNACCEPTABLE BIAS/BEHAVIOR AND WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE."}
{"text":"So i walk up in P'croissants looking to buy a couple bags of croissants Or i would have, had the short mexican dude who was supposed to be aiding my hunger was passively neglecting me. The gall! I waved and said hello but he was busy on his phone and eating on the job. Like..what the frick. I didn't see anybody else so i just stood there thinking \"well, he must be cool poop piles or whatever. Dude's name was Vladmir, he ended up helping me but didn't seem to have the look of urgency or courtesy on his face or probably in his remote vicinity of where his soul would be. Vladmir is a fitting name actually... like the count of croissants. He guards his palace of P'croissant with poignant douchebaggery, like the buttery terror of the night, he holds no crumbs to the pastry dawn, forever watching....but never giving decent customer service. #endrant"}
{"text":"Time to clean up the cobwebs and the smell. It  needs a through cleaning. As for the croissants, a croissant is a buttery, flaky, Vienna?style pastry. The croissants here are gummy and chewy."}
{"text":"After reading many reviews I decided to check it out.  Stopped in right before closing today and I'm so glad I did.  I picked up 2 Bavarian Cream croissants- absolutely amazing.  I will surely be back to try some of the other flavors.  Brought some back to the office and they disappeared so quickly, coworkers asking for more!  The staff was very courteous and really patient even though they were closing shortly.  A+!"}
{"text":"The breakfast veggie with pepper jack is absolutely delicious. I also love the blueberry and almond. I usually take out but the few times I have eaten there, it's been fine with no seating issues."}
{"text":"Yummmm!  Finally had a sandwich from the lunch menu today.  Roast beef and cheddar - delicious.  We normally have the breakfast sandwiches. Love the gooey cheese on the fresh croissant.   Super friendly staff and pretty quick considering the work the put in to make each order."}
{"text":"Their filled croissants are awesome! The only reason I can't give 5 stars is because they are out of croissants about half the time I go there. I appreciate that they might run out by later in the day, but not at 10am on a regular Saturday. Anyway, I've had several varieties of their filled croissants and find them to be super delicious and yummy.  Be sure to go early for best selection!"}
{"text":"I used to LOVE this place... They're still pretty good now but not what they used to be. The croissants used to be *stuffed* with the various delicious fillings, and now they definitely don't put as much of the yum in there. The croissants also seem to be a bit more dry than I recalled. Still a good treat though."}
{"text":"Came here after a disappointing performance from the place next door. I had already eaten, but ordered a bavarian filled and was pleasantly surprised. It didn't have enough filling for my taste, but the flavor was nice. 3 other people in my party had sandwiches which looked generous and they said they were all good. I got a bite of the lemon filled and it was good too. I think prices are a little high, but the food was good overall."}
{"text":"What a waste of time. This wasn't my first choice for breakfast; I had attempted to go to Crepe Bar next door but found they were PACKED so decided I'd try this place. I tried to ask a question about their quiche and the lady didn't understand me. So I just quickly ordered one and paid. She then threw my quiche in a microwave. Really? Aren't you a bakery?? The two ladies next to me ordered quiche as well and theirs was placed in the oven vs microwave - I asked the lady if mine could be heated in the oven as well. She looked at me like I was a nuisance. She started then placing a new quiche in the oven for me, but then the other cashier lady said it would take 20 minutes to place in the oven (she had just told the other two ladies ordering quiche that it'd be ready in 5-10 mins). I asked her why mine would take so much longer and she then proclaimed that she would be placing their quiche in the microwave as well after a little oven time. Seriously... What is wrong with this bakery???!! It's not a fast food joint, yet everything needs to be microwaved?? What a joke.  They microwave their food and the staff is awful. Won't come here again."}
{"text":"This is by far the best croissant joint I've ever been to. Their croissants are so fresh and so tasty! The owner is such a genuine and welcoming person! Go try this place!!"}
{"text":"Just went here for the first time today after months  of wanting to try the place out.  The staff was friendly and the store was clean.  The croissants in my opinion are no better than those sold in a supermarket.  They were very dense and not at all flaky.  If you aren't from Arizona you know the experience of trying out highly rated pizza joints only to be bitterly disappointed.  My experience with the croissants here was the same."}
{"text":"I stopped by here today as we were headed to get crepes next door only to find them closed on a Monday.  :(  So we decided to try the croissant bakery since we were already there.  The service was very friendly, fast and pleasant.  We told them it was our first time there and were informed that there are a ton of different flavored croissants in the morning and that the baker was up at 2 AM preparing the croissants.  We noticed a few in the case, but opted for sandwiches, although the spinach and feta one was kind of calling my name.   I had the turkey, avocado and bacon and my friend had a breakfast egg sandwich.  Mine was a good sized sandwich piled high with the fillings (all fresh) and it was good.  The croissant was definitely fresh, light and fluffy, but I'm not a huge croissant lover unless it's the sweet filled ones and so for me it was just ok (I like mine warm usually and maybe should've asked them to warm it for my sandwich?).  My friend really liked and enjoyed her egg sandwich (filled with veggies and cheese).    All in all this was an ok experience and certainly not disappointing, but in my opinion I would hit this establishment in the morning for a sweet treat as opposed to a lunchtime sandwich."}
{"text":"I have been going here between 10 to 15 years and I still like this place. If you are looking for a great croissant with filling in the middle then this is the place to be."}
{"text":"I stopped by this cute little place on my way to work a couple Fridays ago. I love finding small businesses to try, and this did not disappoint!   I was warmly greeted when I walked through the door by two different employees. There was a younger girl in a chefs jacket filling in the empty spaces in the croissant cases and she said Hello. Seeing I was overwhelmed by the large selection, she asked me if I had been here before and if I wanted any recommendations. She said the chocolate chip and the almond were their best sellers and would be sold out in another 30 minutes or so...and if I preferred savory over sweet to try a breakfast sandwich.   With pretty sound advice, I picked up a 1/2 dozen assortment of the almond and chocolate chip. I also threw in a raspberry cream cheese for the hell of it because I can't say no to anything raspberry and they looked delish!!! Each croissant has a little icing or chocolate design so we can tell what is inside...and every box already has a flavor key taped to it, so I didn't even have to remember!  I checked out...very good value for money! Under $2 a pop! She was so helpful, I wanted to leave a tip for them (note to owner...get a real tip jar!). You could see she didn't normally work at the counter and asked a question to the guy that was making my coffee on how to ring something up. I had 2 hot coffees and the box of croissants and she offered to help me out to my car, too! Great service!  When I got to the office, we cut them up and shared them around. We will definitely be back, hopefully order for staff meetings, and I know I will drive the few blocks out of my way when I want my \"on the way to work on a Friday and I'm too tired to make breakfast at home\" treat.  Keep up the great work...and get there early to get the best flavors!"}
{"text":"We were looking for some quick breakfast this morning when the sign for P. croissants caught my eye. \"STOP!\" I told the hubs, \"we're eating here!\" I love local bakeries! I was delighted to give it a try--it looked like just the kind of place I love.   We walked in and ogled the rows of croissants with myraid fillings. Immediatley I noticed that they had a sort of dull appearance. Okay, I said, so they don't brush them with egg before they bake them. That doesn't mean they won't be delicious!   It was however, an omen. A dull, unremarkable omen,   I ordered a breakfast sandwich with ham, egg, and provolone.  The hubs got himself a Chocolate Bavarian Cream croissant.  Yikes. The egg is microwaved in some tuperware until it is a yellow puff (I hate microwaved eggs: I can do that at home!) and it's piled with ham and cheese. The croissant itself is akin to a McDonalds biscuit. I was sorely disappointed! Especially at nearly six bucks. I grabbed some jelly off of the condiment ar (because I'm weird and I enjoy the flavor combination) and was shocked when the plastic knife wouldn't peirce the jelly in the packet. I mean, this was some really, really old jelly. Yuck. Blech.   The hub's choice was not much better. It was chocolate pudding type filling in an equally McDonaldsy pastry. The revelation from other yelpers that this stuff is not made from scratch (or even close to it) was no surprise.   Non-bakers: please stop opening bakeries!"}
{"text":"If I were to go to this place again, I would get the specialty croissants in the glass case and nothing else. Their Bavarian cream croissants were really tasty.   My friend ordered a vanilla latte to go with her croissant and it was way too milky and diluted. If I'm pairing a croissant with any coffee drink I want it strong and to complement the buttery flakey croissant! In addition, and this is just me being super picky, but one of the servers who got me my tea had really dirty nails and it freaked us out. I don't think he was making actual food l, but still it worried me a little.   Overall: good croissants for takeout."}
{"text":"We've visited P. Croissant over the past few months several times. The food here is pretty good. The filled croissants were tasty, with a bit of filling. I went because someone in one of my classes worked there and brought some to a group meeting once, and they were pretty good. I would have liked to be able to get one without all that icing.  If you call ahead, they can make special requests (like flavor combos not on the menu, or no icing) so there is that. Service from the college age kids who work there is generally fast and very friendly, occasionally a little scatterbrained. They are quick to correct mistakes and do what they can to make things right, though.  However, the new management sucks. Rude and unpleasant to deal with - all the genuine, friendly (albeit ditzy) college kids who used to work here are gone. I've heard enough about their questionable food handling practices (cooking eggs in plastic, using old ingredients, etc) from the employees themselves to not want to come back.   Ultimately it's too expensive for what it is, which is a fancied up frozen croissant. If you notice the owner's comments all throughout the Yelp reviews, you'll notice they never once say the croissants are made from scratch, and the employees themselves have admitted this if you ask them in person. Apparently the other baked goods like the scones, muffins, etc. are from scratch, but the croissants themselves are not.  Lame, P. Croissant, lame."}
{"text":"This is a great spot and the people are super helpful. Call in your order before you stop by and it'll be ready by the time you get there. The croissants are delicious, the breakfast sandwiches are very good (traditional breakfast sandwich just on a croissant!), and they make great coffee drinks. This entire plaza is kind of a hidden gem with crepe bar next door and a drive thru Dairy Queen! Put those three places together in one spot and I think they will remain neighborhood staples for a long time to come! Cheers!"}
{"text":"I am very particular about croissants. Having said that, these were good but not great - the outside was crisp but the inside did not have the spiral layers of a true hand-made croissant.   Essence Bakery is definitely better if you're a croissant purist.   However, they have a mind-boggling array of flavors and I suspect the flavored croissants and croissant sandwiches are pretty great.  We just tried a plain croissant and then had quiches. And the quiches were outstanding - individual round mini-quiches that the very helpful guy at the counter told us could be microwaved in 2 minutes but are better when heated in the oven for 10 minutes. We opted to wait for 10 minutes while we shared the croissant and sipped coffee. Four quiche varieties were available today, and I had quiche Lorraine while my husband had a quiche with tomato and spinach. Both were excellent with a light, tender crust.   We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Just rating their croissants - plain ones & the double baked almond - and simply said, they are EXCELLENT. Just spoke to the one of the owners and the \"secret\" may be that they just use simple, traditional ingredients which includes butter. For me, that explains it all, because most of the crap masquerading as croissants (or crescents) are made with vegetable oil or worse. Moderate amounts of butter are now considered healthy while most oils are not. Enjoy full fat for full flavor is what I always say!!"}
{"text":"I called ahead of time to put my breakfast order in on my way to work. When I got there I bought more croissants. When it was time to pay I completely forgot my debit card at home and did not have cash on me, the gentleman that was working at the time said don't worry about it you can come back and pay later. I apologize many times because I was in embarrassed and didn't want him to think that I wasn't trying to pay for my food. I asked him to give me a pen and paper to write my name, phone number and my address so that If I don't come back he can go ahead and send me a bill. The gentleman was so sweet and very understanding and he  said not to worry and that he trust that ill come back. I left feeling embarrassed got in my car just then I realized I keep a credit card in my car for emergency purposes. I came back in and said look I found some money then he said I knew you'd come back lol. i mean what a nice guy thank you sir (im only sorry i forgot his name)   My food was obviously delicious . I am giving an honest opinion i had the tomato florentine sandwich i cant remember how it tasted cause i was hungry and scarfed it down haha. Oh and my coworkers said the croissants were good.   I suggest calling ahead for your orders because the man was busy and i over heard him say he had a couple employees that was a no show."}
{"text":"Fantastic staff, and good food. I ordered a dozen and a half flavored croissants for my son's first birthday party. They were big enough to fill us up and it was appropriate for all ages. I also ordered a turkey sandwich to go, and that was tasty also!i will be back for the croissants and iced coffee (:"}
{"text":"We came here because the crepe place was closed on Monday...what a fortunate choice! All the croissants are DELICIOUS! Nice and fluffy and large. The \"make a sandwich\" was excellent, the dessert croissants (almond and chocolate) were the perfect amount of sweet. Go here-fun, delicious, kinda kitschy and European!"}
{"text":"We were planning to eat at the crepe bar but when we walked in it was packed and nowhere to sit so we went next door to try P. Croissants for our first time. We've seen this place for years but always went to the crepe bar. I wish we had tried it years ago. My husband had the French connection, my son and I had the egg and cheese croissants, and then we all shared the peanut butter and blueberry cream croissant. We all finished every single bite to include out 5 year old eating his entire huge sandwich. Every bite was impeccable! And the service and owner were wonderful. He checked on us and talked with us a couple times while eating. The best part? It was quiet with great music and peaceful! We will be frequenting this establishment so much more often. We still have so many flavors to try now"}
{"text":"The croissants here move quickly, so I've never had occasion to pick from all the offerings. I have tried and liked okay the apricot and the cherry cheese. The peanut butter and jelly is kind of gross. Service was okay. Coffee was not good at all--tasted watery. Latte also tasted watery.   I have never tried the sandwiches, but I did try a scone which was pretty decent, as far as scones go. Really wanted to try a chocolate croissant, but fat chance of that happening anytime soon.   Located in a strip mall, I seem to remember sponge painting on the walls, possible stenciling. If not, it is the sort of place that would have that. I just wanted to leave, and so I did."}
{"text":"Yummy breakfast sandwiches on delicious, buttery croissants. What more could you ask for? A fun and funky cafe setting...done."}
{"text":"I have seen this place a few times on the way to work so I decided to stop in since I had a bit of a sweet tooth going on today. The latte I ordered was outstanding! Really delicious and mixed perfectly!  The almond chocolate croissant was also great! I wish they would have warmed it a small bit before serving it, but I won't knock a star for something they probably would have done had I asked.   I will be going back!"}
{"text":"I visited once and will probably not go back.  Unfortunately Starbucks has a better corner on this market, and that's not saying much.  Croissants were OK-flaky enough but not rich and buttery like you'd hope.  They offer a wide variety of fillings, which seems very enticing, until you try them.  Stingy remnants of fillings (and I tried 3).  I give 3 stars based on the fact that they weren't terrible and I was offered a free croissant, given that it was the end of the day and they were going to be getting rid of a bunch.  Check it out but don't get your hopes up too high."}
{"text":"The owner was so friendly and welcoming and croissants always warm and tasty! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've driven past this corner for years and never knew this place was here. Decided to give it a try. First impression was positive,  fresh bakery items nicely displayed in cases.  Ordered a blended iced coffee and a white chocolate raspberry scone. The iced coffee was not quite what I was expecting. The process for her to make it was quite long, so  I did expect it to be good. I asked for raspberry syrup in it and the flavor was there, but for some reason when she blended it, it came out very runny. There was no ice blended whatsoever, just liquid. The scone on the other hand was perfect! Just the right blend of white chocolate to raspberry ratio ~ delicious! Moist and light and nice size, big but not too big. I will come back to try the croissant another time since this time they were already pretty low on choices. Need to get here early if you want a good variety to choose from. Tip from the staff said to call ahead and they would put one aside! Nice ~ will have to do that next time. Yep, I'll be back and will have to give the reg. coffee a try. 5\12\14 ~ stopped in for a scone, tried the cranberry one this time. Perfect ~ nice moist texture and perfect ratio of cranberries. More cakey than typical scones so beware. Tried an iced blended coffee again even though of the bad experience last time. Must have been a fluke, this one was GREAT! Got the iced mocha with mango syrup and I love it. Well done P.Croissant!! Need to get back to try the croissant next time!"}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast croissants! Kind service! And the gentlemen decided to give me a free blueberry croissant for my bday!"}
{"text":"The \"Van Gogh\" croissant was vegetarian and really delicious. The service was very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"We stopped for lunch, I had a great chicken salad, others had croissants sandwiches which were filled with a lot of meat. They were soon to close but stayed open for us. Very friendly service and owners"}
{"text":"After reading all the negative reviews on Yelp I was little apprehensive about going here but, I had a hankering for baked goods and I happened to pass this place. This place a pleasant surprise! Unlike the other reviewers upon walking in I was greeted by all 3 employees who were working the front. There was literally a plethora  of filled croissants to choose from. I had the cherry & cream cheese filled one and my friend had the strawberry and cream cheese one. The croissants were light, buttery and flaky. I like how they mixed the fruit filling with the cream cheese so you don't have to worry about that weird gelatin texture. They were only $1 each, which to me is a steal! I will definitely be back to try the others."}
{"text":"I have been repeatedly disappointed in their fruit-FILLED croissants -- they're not FILLED (barely any filling; I've had one or two that were really \"filled,\" and thus developed an expectation).  If I want a fruit croissant, I usually think P.crossiants, but I think I've had enough poor luck that I'll stick to Paradise Bakery for their butter croissants from now on."}
{"text":"If you're craving a croissant, this is the place to go! The pastries remind me of being in Paris!  There are at least 8-10 different flavors/options. I ordered the apple croissant and a vanilla latte for $5.50.  The tip of the croissant was slightly harder/crispier than I would have liked but otherwise it was buttery, flakey and delicious!  Plenty of parking and there's also free WIFI."}
{"text":"Definitely a hidden gem, and one of the neater places I know of in south Tempe. They bake the croissants fresh every day, and every one I've tried has been delicious (they have plain ones and filled ones - peanut butter, chocolate chip, raspberry, and like a dozen other flavors). Raspberry cream cheese is probably my favorite. Good coffee too, with free refills. My only beef with the place is that they run out of croissants pretty fast, and when I've gone in late morning/early afternoon they've usually only had a couple kinds of croissant left to choose from.  On a loosely related note, I've also frequently thought about how if I were a French rapper, I would probably call myself P-Croissant."}
{"text":"Croissants, croissants and more croissants! This place is packed with baked croissgoodness of all kinds. For lunch I ordered the Philly Bastilly - roast beef, provolone, green peppers, onions and mushrooms served with a pile of crisp potato chips. Because it was so buttery good I ordered the feta and spinach croissant to go. Tastes great for breakfast. Can't wait to try the rest of their menu."}
{"text":"Truly great Croissants! I even tried the florentine quiche and it was wonderful.  We ordered out of the display before we looked at the menu. Next time I'll see if they have a ham n cheese croissant."}
{"text":"I dont understand a restaurant that always runs out of food before lunch time.  If you want to try a flavores croissant dont bother showing up after 10am.  The sandwiches are average.  The one upside is the service.  Staff is always friendly... Even when they are telling you they dont have any food to serve you."}
{"text":"My love affair with croissants has been constant, unyielding for 24.5 years. I have, admittedly, been spoiled by an uncle that works for San Francisco's Boudin, who hooks it up with all kinds of croissants all the time. So I've obviously been on a hunt for the Phoenix area's best croissant since my arrival in 2001.   P.Croissant makes a fine pastry. Not fine like okay, but fine like \"ooh damn she fiiiiine.\" It's probably my second favorite that I've found (after Essence, who I thankfully live far away from or else I'd be a space to them). I have only ever had their flavored croissants ($3.19 a pop) and coffee, and generally been pretty pleased with the results. They have a good variety of flavors, ranging from fruity to chocolatey and everything in between. I've tried most of the fruity flavors and have never been disappointed. My go-to order is a black coffee (not mindblowing, but definitely drinkable) and strawberry cream cheese croissant. Hits the spot any time of day.   I only wish they had a drive thru, because I'm the laziest person ever and would love to not have to get out of my car for my flaky buttery delightful carby treat."}
{"text":"Not sure if they changed bakers but I used to come for their scones, they were HUGE and flaky and for the price just GREAT.  Went there the other morning and they were small, heavy and barely edible, in fact so much so that I threw mine away."}
{"text":"We stopped by P. Croissants today for lunch. Our original plan was thwarted because Crepes Bar was so packed that our party could not be accommodated. The dining area is open and conducive to conversations and groups. Order at the counter. Service was friendly enough. I ordered a iced chai latte. My daughter had the iced mocha latte. Their drinks were well mixed, and they had soy milk. They would have gotten 5 stars if that was all we ordered.   We ordered the Eiffel Croissant Sandwich. It was nice but unremarkable. We also added avocado and had to take it back because they forgot the avocado. We also ordered the French Onion Soup. Sadly, they did not have Swiss Gruyere cheese but melted a sad slice of Swiss cheese over a handful of small croutons. The stock was underwhelming, lacking in depth. Nevertheless, it was accommodating for the young children that were with us, and our party had a nice time in a quiet environment. Our bill came up to around $20.  I should have tried the dessert croissants. They looked delicious."}
{"text":"Stopped in today for the first time. Wanted to grab breakfast. Had a very yummy hot croissant sandwich with egg, cheese, bacon, and vegetables. I also enjoyed a latte. The sand which wasn't the most mind blowing, delicious thing I ever ate, but it was pretty darn good. It was made fresh and the croissant was delicious. The latte was so so; I prefer almond milk which they didn't have. The customer service was fantastic and very attentive, caring. I didn't check out any of the other pastries, but they all look amazing!"}
{"text":"Light, fluffy and sinfully delicious! I highly recommend stopping in for a meal, a treat or a box of sweet or savory sensation for your office."}
{"text":"Friendly service and lots of options. Outdoor seating and kid toddler chairs for the little one. It's delicious"}
{"text":"Service definitely brought down my rating.  I waited about 20 minutes for my iced coffee while the guys were just standing there and mopping the floor.  Finally, I had to ask if they were going to give me my iced coffee.  The other cashiers ignored me and pushed me away until finally an older gentleman helped me out.  However, he didn't know how to blend coffee.  The poor guy had to remake it twice before finally giving me my chunky coffee.  He told me that once it melts, I could drink it.  Croissant was delicious however"}
{"text":"As I was driving from meeting with a client,I came across P.Croissants and decided to give it a try for a quick lunch.   I spent a ridiculously long time trying to decide on a pastry, they offer 21 varieties of croissants. It all looked wonderful. Flavors like chocolate bavarian cream, white chocolate, butterscotch...how does one choose. The pastries looked very fresh, perfectly golden and delicious.  I finally decided on a scone and coffee! The coffee was fine and the scone was incredible. Perfectly crisp on the outside, it was filled was plump cranberries, each bite was gorgeously buttery and delicious.   I will just have to go back to try a croissant. I would be interested in trying one of their sandwiches too, fun names like Franklin's French Mistress ,Bon- a- part and Guillotine is definitely worth a try.   The atmosphere at P. Croissant is casual and cozy. It was clean and the staff were very friendly and in my case very patient!!! P. Croissant will be seeing more of me in the future."}
{"text":"This place does have good croissants. That is not their problem.   Whatever you do, do NOT order a breakfast sandwich. They microwave the egg in a plastic dish. It is completely unaccepatible. I am a bit of a health nut and was SHOCKED that a restaurant that makes such beautiful croissants would serve eggs like that. It doesn't taste good and it's not healthy. Everyone knows you don't microwave in plastic unless you want cancer.   Here's what they need to do. They need to focus on making better breakfast food to compliment the croissants. They also  need to call in a decorator to create a better ambience.  If they did these two things, they would be so busy they would have to move to a bigger location. Arizonians love a good breakfast after a hike, and this place currently doesn't cut it."}
{"text":"Had the chicken salad croissant, it was actually very good. The place was cramped and service was confusing. Just an average place, but a decent backup if you cant get a table at the crepe bar next door."}
{"text":"So I went in thinking they actually make these things from scratch. Which 99% of the time means real ingredients.  I looked at the croissants and they looked unappetizing, the decription sounded good but the didnt look flakey or anything.  Which was a sign of hydrogenated oil, for some reason it weighs croissants down and is not only worse for you than saturated fat it makes them taste like shit.   I asked the woman if there was partially hydrogenated oil in any of the food or margairine which has trans fat. She went and get the 13 yr old baker.   Who told me they dont make the icing which has partially hydrogenated oil.  WTF!! why would I just go to the grocery store if I didnt care about the oil. I could get 7 unfresh pasteries for this price? The make there shit from a mix and have premade icing.  That is literraly the dumbest thing I have heard of.  I am definetly sending them an email, because if they dont even make there food than there is actually no point."}
{"text":"A good sandwich, but steer clear if you are conscious of price."}
{"text":"I really love to hit this place on the weekend when I am in the area. They have a great selection of croissant's that are filled with different chocolates and fruits. The key is to get there early as if you arrive by lunchtime there won't be a whole lot left. If you're in the mood for something like a fluffy croissant with white chocolate drizzled on top or raspberries inside then this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"I think its best to come here with an open mind because its not really a full fledge, hot butter-melty flakey crossaint place.  I don't recall how flaky the croissants are to be honest because I was too busy checking out the list of fillings they have inside their croissants.  Also they make a bunch of other snacks that are pretty good too.  Check out their website for the full listing of fillings they have inside their croissants.  Its a very long list and should fulfill anyone's desire of a peanut butter or even butter scotch croissant.    Oh ehh, i know its kind of weird at first because U can't quite place it.  The choices of flavors reminds me of selections normally found at a donut store.  Yet the appearance of the crossaints are between a bagel and a english muffin.  But hey, eat it and enjoy it :)  I had their breakfast sandwich kind of thing and its decent, tried their sweet croissant and it made me smile.  So come here if u like donuts, but wanna try something a little different, come here if u want to seek out a nicely made breakfast sandwich vs the typical microwave ones, and come here if u want breakfast on the go :)   I support the guts the owner has in pursuing this very interesting take on croissants and I shall be back again :)"}
{"text":"This is not a croissant , at least not like any croissant I have ever seen or eaten.  I ordered the raspberry croissant and got a big , round, soft jelly filled roll. Don't think I'd ever have a reason to go back.  Too bad. Seems they had really delicious and flaky croissants back in their earlier days."}
{"text":"This place is always sucking me into their delicious hell! There isn't a thing on the menu that isn't amazing! They have dessert croissants and sandwiches made w their croissant (both are amazing). They also have various other pastries on the side that are different day to day such as Danishes, turn overs, quiches, etc. The coffee here is amazing. I used to go to Dutch bros or Starbucks before work for my fix but now I come here to get their sugar free hazelnut latte which doesn't taste sugar free. I also just started coming here to get my ground coffee as well. This place is amazing. I highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Before I get into anything, let me reiterate to you what the name of this restaurant is.  P.croissants  That being said, here we go.  This place is known solely for having fantastic croissants.  They are not known for their great breakfast sandwiches.  They are known for making great croissants.  And for that, they are doing a great job.  They really do not need to fix anything.  How do I know this?  Just go into their store late Sunday morning.  Their croissants will be ALL GONE.  What does that tell you?  It means that people come for the croissants.  OBVIOUSLY, if people are eating them, they are good.  It's common sense.  I give this place a 4 stars.  It's clean, it has good coffee, but it is lacking a lot of indoor space... This is an almost-5-star review.  Very, very, very close.  Just not quite there."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Yum!!!! Great for work meetings. You'll be everyone's new best friend. ;)"}
{"text":"Croissants are yummy (much more than donuts), especially when filled with chocolate chips... or raspberry... or cream cheese.. or all three, I'm sure. Anyway, I also had an egg, bacon and swiss croissant sandwich, which was super oily but delicious.  They just moved into a new location on the corner of the strip mall they are in. I gather from Bonnie's review that it's a huge improvement over the location she visited, because the new corner space is pleasant and pretty cozy.   The only downside is that service was SUPER slow and they were getting orders wrong. The line just kept growing.. and growing....   The food was good enough that I plan on going back, though."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing croissants (i tried blueberry) and sandwich! The people were also extremely friendly."}
{"text":"Pastries made with LOVE. Went there yesterday, and it was Amazing. So many different flavors of croissants. The service was so warm and genuine. The gentleman behind the counter pointed out some different flavors and touched on how they are made fresh, every morning. He saw my hands full since I had my 3 yr old with me, and without hesitation, helped me to our table. Came back a few moments later to make sure we were enjoying everything. My son asked if his sister could \"come over sometime\" and they had  an amicable chat over what croissant might be her favorite.    The apricot croissant was just the right texture, and it tasted like delicious, homemade goodness. The filling was just right-- enough that it was tasetful and delicious but not an overload. Its a croissant afterall, not a Hostess fruit pie. You could taste the freshness, the quality of ingredients. You could tell they take pride in what they do.  Its definitely on our regular spot list now!"}
{"text":"To be fair, the food is good, very good actually. But when a restaurant gives your food to another table and then continues serving to other tables while you wait a half hour it's impossible to give a decent rating. Won't return because there are lots of restaurants to choose from in this world... So why go to a place that blows off your order?"}
{"text":"After a horrible experience at the Crepe place next door, we ran in and had a some great food. Nice staff, good prices, food and service!"}
{"text":"Charming staff. I think I know who the owner is. He's there often. He's cheerful and of course it trickles down to the staff, who all have a cheerful, helpful attitude. My problem is that I am allergic to dairy products and it's far too often that they don't have non-dairy powdered creamer. Sometimes yes, sometimes no. Come on boss, buy a box of it and make sure it's there all the time.They used to have the little creamer mini-tubs of non-dairy creamer...you've seen them, they are about an inch tall and you pull the foil cover off...they come in vanilla, chocolate, hazelnut, you know....well one time a few months ago one of the help said they cost too much. Hey, you're making money on this place, right? Gosh if you can't afford that and profits are barely coming off the gross intake, then get a consultant or let me talk tough love, sell it to someone who can make it profitable. Don't do it halfway or on the cheap or whatever, ok?   One other thing is that they use thermos type coffee urns with no heating coils in them and as the coffee sits it cools. I have had lukewarm coffee as often as not mid-morning. They need a coffee pot that keeps the coffee hot.   Lots of times I see plates sitting on tables that have long been empty of food and the patrons hang out for a bit to finish their coffee and the dirty plates just sit there and sit there. Hey staff, come bus those tables and as soon as someone leaves a table you need to be there to clean it and get the crumbs off the chairs. Foods good, very French stuff, tasty, fresh, I must say....but the details need to be attended to.    Yes I'll be back. Thanks for the opportunity to make my suggestions."}
{"text":"P. Croissants keeps it fairly simple, so I am going to do the same with my review:  Croissants - AMAZING. Like everyone says, get their early. I really loved the cherry cheese, strawberry, and peanut butter varieties.   Sandwiches - Meh. Maybe my hopes were too high. They took forever to make and were just so-so.  Coffee and Espresso drinks - BOO. Overpriced and not very good. Go somewhere else for your java."}
{"text":"Amazing croissants and I can attest to several different versions. All good!! We bought, okay,  I bought 4 different kinds and tried 3 of them.  Apple, raspberry and plain all delicious.  They also had a good selection of hot teas for me and I loved the flavored green that I tried.  They were very friendly when I called 1st thing in the morning to ask them to put 1/2 a dozen aside. (I had read they could ran out and was having a late morning meeting.)  Service was friendly, price was very reasonable and the location was clean.  Bravo P'Croissants!!"}
{"text":"Today I tried the Chocolate muffin.  Another great item baked fresh at PCroissant.   They also make a great Crème brûlée and excellent breakfast too."}
{"text":"I decided one day to work outside the office.  I had to concentrate on some writing and sometimes my work is not the best place to do that because I share an office.  I decided to go to Bunna, but was sidetracked.  I saw P.Croissants and had to go in.  I ordered a ham and egg breakfast sandwich and an iced mocha.  It was probably not the healthiest thing to eat, but I didn't care.  It was really good.    They have free wi-fi and I was able to work outside on my project.  A great start to my morning with yummy food and a comfortable work environment. :)"}
{"text":"The coffee - specifically lattes - sooooo good. So much better than Starbucks. And the croissants are amazing - chocolate cream, peanut butter, blueberry are my favorites but I've never had a bad one. The place is a gem!"}
{"text":"So so good! My daughter is a plain croissant kinda girl, my son loves everything. Their sandwiches are good, the croissants are very flaky and fresh. Get there early for the best selection."}
{"text":"Tried the Bavarian cream croissant with stripes of chocolate icing on top and a cup of drip coffee. The coffee was bitter and had a high acid taste--I only drank about 25% of the small cup since I do not like bitter coffee. The croissant was unexpectedly super sweet due some type of sugar glaze under the chocolate stripes. It left the same sugary after taste as a doughnut. The texture was somewhat flaky, but became gummy as you chewed it. Maybe that is the texture they are trying to achieve, but not the texture I am used to in a croissant. The Bavarian cream inside was excellent. The store is clean, parking is close to the door, and employees are friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Like the third time I've been here and they are out of croissants. It's ten am. Last time I got the last ones. Kind of disappointing that you drive over and they are always sold out."}
{"text":"If the previous owners are still in town, I wonder if it makes them sad to see what happened to their specialty concept?   If you went to the original in Tempe or Ahwatukee (before they closed it in the early 90's) you could tell that their little gem would flourish in a larger space with some appropriate decor and ambiance, specialty coffees, etc.   Sadly, while these changes were made by the new owners 5 or so years ago, the quality of the product went downhill and the prices went up. I recently tried a breakfast croissant again and I'd swear the croissant came from Costco...it was that mediocre. Gone is the delicate blend of overnight proofed crispy exterior with layers of tender inner croissant. I bought a filled croissant for later and it was so disappointing; I'm embarrassed I let my taste buds down this way.   I've tried going back several times over the last few years. I want to like them, I want to support them, but they are overpriced and underwhelming...I wont go back again.  If you never went to the original owners' Pleassant Croissant and think P. Croissant is great...continue to live in blissful ignorance. I, on the other hand mourn the loss of the father and son that delivered the original delicate delights that were worthy of praise and their price."}
{"text":"I ordered a croissant breakfast sandwich with egg, ham, cheese, mushrooms, and red onions. As the door dash guy dropped my breakfast off to me at work, I began to eat my breakfast. 30 minuets later I feel very bloated and sour stomach. I end up throwing up what I ate. I got food poisoning. First time I tried this place and the last time I'll ever have. Please don't come eat at this place. If the cooks or kitchen manager are not on top of checking their food and rotating properly, more people will get sick."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff! Was my first time here and I was told the breakdown, they make fresh croissants nightly and offer breakfast and lunch options. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Only flaw and mean only was the free wifi was inoperable.  Could not as for better croissants"}
{"text":"3 1/2  We took a chance on finding a small breakfast nook when we saw the Croissants sign on the strip mall. We checked it out and saw one of the most unappealing cafeteria spaces for an eatery. Seriously. The last time I wanted to not eat somewhere this much was at a) The U-Mass Boston cafeteria which had nasty carpted squares, folding chairs, uneven tables mounted on sugar packets and NO WINDOWS and b) the Boston City Hall cafeteria, which was in a BASEMENT, had checkered small tables on dirty floors and I swear to god a BLIND man making egg sandwiches!  So we surveyed the scene, asked the very accomidating near-by Bunna Coffee if we could eat our sandwiches there, and commenced our ordering. First off, this place is all about croissants. There are no surprises here-almond paste, blueberry, apple cinnamon, cherry, strawberry, chocolate, raspberry, chocolate BAVARIAN creme! But I really wanted a hot sandwhich where this hilarious conversation ensued \"So, I would like an egg and cheese, provolone please, croissant sandwich...with the vegetables\" \"Um, we are out of the green peppers and onion\" Ok...can I get the avocado?\" \"Yes, you can get that\" \"Can I get the sprouts?\" \"We are out of that (starts laughing\" \"Are you fucking with me?\" \"No, we really ARE out of sprouts\" And the cook in the back calls out \"And we are all out of tomatoes, too\" The staff looked at each other and said \"I guess we just ran out of the stuff we had plenty of yesterday\"....hmmm, I thought, maybe the clue to this mystery is people come there to EAT...and people maybe ATE the food they are OUT of...and someone forgot to buy MORE of it? Just a crazy guess here, guys! For my avocado, cheese and egg  and his ham, cheese and egg, it came out to 8 something with tax (a little steep, but the croissants are HUGE and DELISH). They even put it on a plate for us to walk down the strip mall to commence at Bunna Coffee-classy. And they were perfect-I was actually even full before I ate my second half, and I am a breakfast fanatic, so that is pretty damn impressive.  I think what maybe un-nerved me the most at this place were the guys just kinda...hanging OUT there. I mean, who goes to a strip mall this part of town and just kinda hangs out, not drinking coffee or eating, at a cafeteria style bakery? Do you know? I know I wasn't going to stick around and find the fuck out, thats for sure!"}
{"text":"I worked at the Dairy Queen in this complex for 5 years and loved this place. I still go when I am in the area. Their breakfast sandwich croissants are sooo good! Get the bacon, egg and cheese croissant and you wont be disappointed. The service is not the best but they are super nice. They don't always pick the brightest crayons in the box for employees but they are giving high school kids the chance to work, which is fine with me. This place is good and deserves at lease a try. I would take their breakfast sandwiches over the crap at a Starbucks or Einstein's.  Give it a try if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Sandwich portions a bit small for the price, but very tasty. Take advantage of the extra meat/cheese option.  A good variety of add-ons for the sandwiches (veggies).  Pastry croissants reasonably priced and portioned. Good selection in the morning, but dwindles quickly.  The espresso drinks need some serious help. Not awful, or burnt - but really, really blah."}
{"text":"These crossiants are delicious. I had one for breakfast and one for lunch. Breakfast was carmel apple. So yum chocolate on crust through me off. Would of been better with true carmel drizzled across the crust. For lunch made a leftover turkey sanwhich.  Truly blessing to find this joint."}
{"text":"Really been wanting to try this place out. I'm glad did. I got a croissant sandwich. It came with chips and a pickle. The croissant was very flaky and light. The price was fairly reasonable for what you get. I will definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Yum yum and yum. Picked up a warm savory croissant filled with spinach and cheese, as well as an iced vanilla latte. Pricing was very reasonable; in fact I was pretty surprised! What a treat; both my coffee and croissant were amazing. I took mine to go, however this is a great place to eat in at as well... With a friend, or just a good book or your laptop to get a little work done. Putting P.croissant on my list of places to start my morning happy!"}
{"text":"So excited that we have this awesome locally owned breakfast place right down the street from our new house! It's my daughters favorite & she asks to go all the time, so it's our special spot for delicious croissants ;)   Hint: You'll definitely want to order extras for later.."}
{"text":"Came here today because Crepe Bar was a crowded mess.  I was pleasantly surprised.  My croissant was deliciously buttery and flaky.  The chef came out to ask how the meal was.  The coffee was actually WAY better than Crepe Bars (which tastes sour like Dunkin Donuts to me). They only lose a star for service and that's just because they seem to need a number system so the girl bringing out the food isn't going up to every table with your food."}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast spots in Phoenix!!! I've been coming here since I was a little kid and have really enjoyed watching P.Croissants' success over the years! They've been open for over 20 years, a testament to their fantastic food and great service! Their current location is much larger and nicer than their previous store (same plaza). The owners are kind and genuine - this is a small business you definitely want to support!  Everything on the menu is delicious but my favorites are croissant breakfast sandwiches (egg, bacon, cheese) and their cream cheese/strawberry croissants. Every flavored croissant is amazing, so you'll be able to find a flavor to please everyone. Croissants are baked daily at like 3am, so they are as fresh as can be... however, when they run out of a flavor, that's it for the day. (Grab yours early in the morning, or order in advance!) Excellent coffee - espresso, americanos, lattes, etc. P.Croissant has tasty lunch sandwiches, as well as salads and soups.   If you know you'll want more than a couple of croissants on a weekend or holiday, ORDER A FEW DAYS IN ADVANCE! Also, don't forget to grab a stamp card if you order a sandwich!"}
{"text":"Great little restaurant for lunch or breakfast!  The Florentine salad was amazing and my don loved his veggie sandwich."}
{"text":"It's been a few months strong, but I am still in love with Pleaissant Croissant Patisserie!  How can you not be?   The minute you walk in, you feel as if you are at a café in Paris!  I now have had time to try the many items they offer, from flavored croissants, breakfast croissant sandwiches, salads, coffee, water, tea.  Every single time, the croissants are soo light, buttery melt in your mouth good! I have worked my across most of the flavored one, though the Cherry Cream is my favorite all of them are so very delish!!  So happy to have found this little bit of heaven!"}
{"text":"No. Not even close to what a croissant should taste like. Very bland. Texture was all wrong--no flake! Yuck. The vegetables with the egg and cheese were cold as well.  My husband didn't have as bad of a reaction but we both agree we have no reason to return."}
{"text":"We went at around 11:30am and they only had five or so croissants left. We weren't upset by this because we had never been here before. I found the owner to be extremely welcoming and helpful as he greeted us and explained what they made and offered. We couldn't help but laugh at the dopey girl at the register who asked my wife and I \"are you two together?\", while we had our arms wrapped around each other.   As far as the food goes, we ordered a couple of croissants, a Philly sandwhich, coffee and tea. I thought the food was pretty alright. I'm not used to the texture of croissants so the first bite seemed a little soggy for a sandwhich. The more I ate, I enjoyed it, but I don't think it's that great of a value for the $20 we spent.  The owner seems like a cool guy but I don't think this place has the best options if you are going out for a late brunch."}
{"text":"my husband and I ate here a few weeks back and found it to be ok. The service was very awkard and absent minded, but friendly. My husband and I ordered identical breakfast sandwiches and a butterscotch crossiant to share. The lady taking the order must have been overwhelmed because she kept asking us what we wanted on our sandwich and when our order was ready, the sandwiches were slightly wrong.   We first had to ask for our butterscotch crossiant as they forgot to give it to us, then both of our breakfast sandwiches were half right. We ordered our sandwiches with veggies and we didn't get veggies. I didn't really mind, but  my husband politely asked if his could be re-made. They were very gracious about re-making the sandwich and gave him a new one right away.   The butterscotch crossiant was good, but sort of disappointing. I would have liked more butterscotch.   All in all this place wasn't bad. I would go back. I do think their prices are a little high for what you get."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place since I was a little girl and when it was only ran by one guy. It used to be a Sunday treat for us to go in the mornings and get a box of these bad boys before church. You have to get there early to get the good stuff and they will run out. Its a testament to how good their pastries are. I only ever get the cream cheese croissant. Ever. I honestly haven't tried any of their coffee, but their sandwiches are pretty good. But back to my first point, you only even need to get the cream cheese one ;) Some of the other flavors aren't worth it, like the Peanut Butter one, but if you are feeling decadent the bavarian and chocolate is the way to go."}
{"text":"A wonderful little breakfast and lunch nook with a french flare and lots of natural light make you feel like you should renew your passport.  Croissants are to die for.  Turn one it a breakfast sandwich and you have memorable meal that will make you wonder if you just experienced the high point of your day.  Personal selection: egg cheese ham and veggie breakfast croissant."}
{"text":"This little neighborhood spot is good for a quick lunch. They used to have a lunch deal for a croissant sandwich with chips, but now for the same price it is just the sandwich...chips are extra. Their sandwiches are generous on the fillings and the croissants are large.  I have also ordered breakfast croissants by the dozen for holidays or celebrations. They are always a hit...mostly for the different fillings that are offered. They are pricey...so it is not like picking up a dozen donuts or a bagel bucket for the office."}
{"text":"Drove all the way from Peoria to try out the Crepe Bar....unfortunately, they were on \"summer break\" and won't be open until Monday. (Still upset about that!)  FORTUNATELY, there is a croissant place right next door. I love croissants, and these are fresh, huge, and delicious!! I had the Bavarian cream and my boyfriend had the raspberry one. Both were very, very good. They are so fluffy, soft, and a little crunchy on the outside!! To be honest, I thought it would be stuffed with filling and too sweet for me, but it had just the right amount for me! My boyfriend does not really like sweet stuff, but he enjoyed the raspberry filled croissant.   Very glad we came here :) If it were on our side of the town...I think I would go quite often.."}
{"text":"The sandwiches here used to be very nicely made and interesting. Sadly, they appear to have come under a new management or cost-cutting regime and the sandwiches now are fairly mediocre, particularly at their prices.  Sorry to see one of our favorites go, but it has happened."}
{"text":"I love this place.  For the area it is good.  Early in the morning you get to choose from a large variety of croissants.  As the day progresses they sell out of flavors so go early."}
{"text":"Note to self: If the staff behind the counter is fighting loudly with each other, just leave.   The boyfriend and I needed a quick breakfast this AM so we decided to head over to P. Croissant. We've been before and while the croissants are overpriced, they're decent so we figured it would be a good option. We were wrong.  We walked in and it was relatively busy. There was a short line so we found our place in the queue and were quickly greeted with the sounds of two staffers fighting loudly with each other. Good Morning to you too! They were both obviously stressed out and were blaming each other for their own freak out but it made us feel very uneasy. We ordered two breakfast sandwiches and I don't even think I got a thank you.  We then proceeded outside to find a table to sit at but almost every chair (and table) had bird poop all over it. The one chair that didn't had something (orange juice I hope) spilled on it. And I'm not talking about a little spec of bird crap. There was enough to really gross me out. So, back inside.  We finally get our sandwiches. They were okay. The bacon was pretty rubbery - probably because they microwave everything. But honestly even if the sandwich had been amazing, the atmosphere created by the staff was so off-putting I lost my appetite.   I know working in food is not easy but fighting in front of customers again and again is just not acceptable."}
{"text":"Not sure how I was unaware of this little gem located in the corner of a plaza that I visit so often.  Luckily my grandmother was.  I came here early on a Monday morning to find a clean, well kept small croissant shop.  I picked up 3 items.  Chicken Quiche- Amazing! Had to fight my dad for the last bite. Peanut Butter Croissant- Didnt get to try as it was demolished by a friend Regular Croissant- As good as it gets.  Great staple.   Long story short give this place a shot.  You will not regret supporting this small, local business.    I will for sure be returning next time I am in town."}
{"text":"Croissants still a little doughy but I never leave a crumb so maybe they need to be looked at as their own product and not as a classic crossiant. In that light they are excellent. In the last three weeks there seems to have been a staff change and now they smile and act like they want you to be there. It was not terrible befor but it is better now.  If you have not been there yet - go to the Y for some exercise and then drop in for a croissant, some coffee and some conversation."}
{"text":"Pros: Lots of flavors to choose from, easy code system for croissants, plenty of parking, and attentive staff  Cons: Incredibly dry croissants"}
{"text":"The croissants had improved so nicely since my previous review. Size, filling, texture and taste are ideal.  So I felt drawn back to that light flakey texture, buttery deliciousness....  Previous visit: Yesterday (weeks ago) was not consistent at all.  The croissants looked like blobs.  I even asked if they had a new Baker working today and the guy helping to get our order to ld me no, he's the same baker.   I picked up a dozen to take to my vets office and we ate one on our way.  That croissant was more like bread.  It was not flakey, airy, buttery.  It was more like bread.  Even the almond flavor was off. I had specifically requested the chocolate and Bavarian cream (?) filled croissant for Cindy at the front desk of the office.  What arrived was the Chocolate Chip filled one.  Not such a bad deal but she finished while I was still at the office and told me there was not a single Chocolate chip inside. P. Croissant, you're working on a record low. I could've picked up doughnuts, or hit the bakery (Karls) closer to their office, but I thought this would be a good stop on this day.  This morning: Went in to see croissants that appeared about 1/3 smaller and almost flat.  Just blob looking things. I was trying to decide which to have packed up and just changed my mind and left   Just very bummed. We used to come to Pleasant Croissant when owned by the original owner and they may have run out early but there was always delicious consistency back then."}
{"text":"Wonderfully fresh croissants and additional pastries (scones, muffins, quiche, and sandwiches)  I've enjoyed their croissants for years and they are by far the freshest (and largest!) I've had anywhere. They have a wide variety of flavors - from plain to chocolate and fruit fillings."}
{"text":"Ok people....this place is not TC Eggingtons or US Egg.  The breakfast selection is not extensive...they dont have a grill.  It is a good local croissant shop with a huge variety of croissants and other delicious treats shuch as eclairs, scones and muffins.  The coffee is descent and the atmosphere and service is better than average.  If your looking for a knock your socks off breakfast, go elsewhere.  If you want a freshly baked pastry that you wont find anywhere else in the valley....this is your spot."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place. Very good tuna croissant!  Nice change from the usual sandwich. Nice employees too. No wait on Sunday at 1:30."}
{"text":"Long time location with fresh approach, good bakery and pleasant attentive management"}
{"text":"Service is very slow!! Breakfast croissants were so so. Served cold and lacked taste!"}
{"text":"Yummm the croissants at this small family owned pastry shop are to die for. There are perhaps 20 different fruit and other sweet flavored croissants to select from. My favorite is the strawberry. I first decided to stop into this shop 3 weeks ago and I have been back at least 4 times since... I'm hooked. My favorite part about the pastries is that you can tell that the fruit fillings are made from scratch and God Bless the pastry chef for not being heavy handed on the sugar as to avoid the tragic syrupy-jelly effect. The quich are also very scrumptious with a light-flakey crust. The Lorraine is my fav and it is just enough to fill you, while not making you feel like a guilty glutton. Oh, and the prices are suuuper fair. I don't know where else in America you can get a fresh baked croissant for under $3, so great job team P' Croissant. I'm officially a regular."}
{"text":"I don't normally write bad, but holy poop! $6 dollars for an average ham, egg, cheese and hard croissant sandwich!  Next time will go get a crepe next door. Very over priced and quality is way down from childhood days!"}
{"text":"All I have ever sampled here is the croissants and they are a buttery delight and butter is not cheap and neither are the croissants but well worth the treat. Enjoy"}
{"text":"It's been 4 years since my last review of P. Croissants! Many croissants and pastry experiences later, I have to say I was disappointed in my last meal here. I had a cheese, vegetable and egg croissant with an iced vanilla latte. The sandwich itself was a large size and had a lot of filling but the croissant tasted quite honestly like something I can buy from Costco (Not to knock Costco croissants at all, but if your business is specifically selling croissants they should taste better than what you can buy at a store).  The latte looked almost white because it was mainly milk and not much coffee. It also tasted pretty much like milk with the barest hint of coffee and vanilla. I got the large size but I wonder if they just used the regular amount of coffee but then loaded up on milk instead of making the drink more proportional and adding more espresso.   The cashier was very nice but he seemed a bit flustered with our orders and we had to repeat them a few times back to him.  Due to disappointing croissants and coffee, downgraded a star."}
{"text":"This place has the best croissants I've ever eaten. They are a bit pricey but what do you expect with such a high quality product. Every flavor I've ever had tastes great and they melt in your mouth. They have a neat labeling system so that you can tell which flavor is which when you get a big box of them."}
{"text":"Excellent bakery/ lunch cafe! We recently moved to a neighborhood near this and were so happy to find a delicious locally owned eatery within walking distance. The owners and staff are always welcoming and they serve fantastic food. We highly recommend P. Croissant to friends and family!  They're so good we've even noted that a French club meets there to enjoy their food during their meeting!"}
{"text":"they microwaved my croissant on a Styrofoam plate. when I told the child working there that's unacceptable, she reacted like I was trying to explain theoretical physics in Cantonese.   I will not eat food microwaved on Styrofoam. I didn't realize that was some secret thing no one but me knows is bad for you."}
{"text":"This place has excellent croissants with a great selection of delicious flavors. Great for breakfast and lunch!"}
{"text":"Pretty good selection. If you want a croissant from the shelf come early!  I've been there twice and haven't gotten to try a fruit filled one yet because they are always sold out. Light abs flaky croissants!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place. Selection was really good. Croissant sandwich was really good. Service was really good. Will come back to this place. Forgot what I ordered but remembered it was really good."}
{"text":"This place has the best danishes I've ever had, hands down, no contest, absolutely amazing. Ordering from this place has been consistently a great experience.  The staff is the best. All thier breakfast sandwiches are pretty amazing and their coffee is great as well. This place is a real gem, I love coming here."}
{"text":"At first glance, these croissants are to die for.  They're huge and have pretty designs on them (to differentiate them in case you buy an assortment of flavors).  The croissant itself is extremely light I mean, you could easily convince yourself that they're calorie-free, so that's a giant plus right there in my book.  The pastry is mildly sweet so it doesn't take away from the filling.  Unfortunately, this is where it falls short cause there isn't very much filling in any of these croissants.  I really hate to say this, cause I really like these croissants but if you're here for the fillings, you're probably better off getting a bavarian creme or jam donut cause there's probably 2-3 times the filling in one of those than in one of these croissants.  But if you're not too concerned about the fillings and a croissant is what you want, definitely give it a shot."}
{"text":"I think this place is great. Their croissants are awesome and have such a good texture and taste. If you're looking for a simple but tasty breakfast or lunch this place is for you"}
{"text":"I like this place, it has very exotic pastries. I dont know how to explain it, they are just very upscale and exotic. The counter people are very polite too, its a very upscale experience, very delightful. I like the almond croissant and the salads."}
{"text":"I have a rule, if I can make a much better version of the same dish at home for cheaper then it isn't worth my money to go back to that restaurant. This was definitely one of those experiences where I could have easily made the food better at home for half the cost. Granted, P.Croissant isn't overly expensive or anything, the food is just sub-par and disappointing.   My husband and I got breakfast sandwiches (egg, cheese, meat, veggies). He ordered the ham and I had the sausage. The ham was cheap deli meat (we were expecting breakfast ham) and the sausage tasted like Jimmy Dean microwaveable patties. Nothing special. The veggies were what really got my goat though. The menu says the sandwich comes with bell pepper, onion, and mushroom. My sandwich had two sad, thin slices of mushroom, one on each half (see photo) My husband's sandwich had the same sparse fare. The onion and pepper was also cut very thinly so even though it covered the sandwich there really wasn't any substance to it. There was more egg than anything.   The customer service was good but they have locked bathrooms and you have to ask for a key that comes attached to this big piece of plastic. When one guy went up to ask for the bathroom key, the woman who was cooking grabbed the key with her gloved hand and then went back to preparing food WITHOUT CHANGING THE GLOVE! I don't even want to think about what might be on that plastic considering it probably gets set on all imaginable surfaces of those bathrooms. Not to mention all the people that have handled it without washing their hands. I shudder to think...  So, long story short, we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Thanks for the excellent customer service!  My sister and I stopped in after a disappointing visit to the crepe place next door. The owner was very friendly and explained all of their flavors and treats. Since we couldn't decide between two flavors, he gave us both for the price of one. We loved the welcoming atmosphere and thought the almond croissants were delicious! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love the croissants here.  They are so soft and flavorful, not like ones you can buy at any store around here that I know of.  I first tried one when I got one wrapped as a baby shower take-away gift.    I haven't tried the sandwiches, but the staff was super friendly and the hot tea was only a buck!  I thought it was very reasonably priced comparatively speaking and their marketing was professional.  Not the best atmosphere I've ever seen, I'd give it a 7 or 8."}
{"text":"Delicious. That's the best word to describe Pleaissant Croissant. After driving past the place in the evening several times, we finally made it in there one morning a few months ago. Since then its been a regular breakfast stop for us (that and Bagel Nosh). They're open nice and early and we can sit outside with the puppy and enjoy a croissant or two.   The food there is very good. The selection is about what you would expect from a place that has the word croissant in the name. A wide variety of tasty croissant sandwiches are available for breakfast and lunch, but where the place really shines is it's signature pastry. The filled croissants are outstanding and the perfect start to a Saturday morning. My favorites are the cherry and cinnamon apple while my girl loves the lemon. While I am normally not big on icing or frosting, both the regular and chocolate icing on these croissants get two big thumbs up.  The restaurant itself its relatively straight forward with two large glass displays showing off their wide variety of croissants. They have fountain drinks and a cooler with juices, etc. As I mentioned there is a small outdoor section that's nice in the mornings, but nothing special. The decor is that horrible french cartoon painting stuff that seemed to be popular a little while ago. I never understood that, but it goes with the whole croissant thing so I'll give it a pass. I wonder if they have that sort of thing in France or is it just here when we try to make something look French? Anyway, it's a great place for breakfast in Tempe that's not too busy on the weekends."}
{"text":"Friendly guy at the counter serving up delicious croissants. I bought 1/2 a dozen and mixed it up. The almond and chocolate almond were my favorite. You can't go wrong with a filled croissant!"}
{"text":"In reponse to some of the 1-star reviews on here for this place:  Yikes, people.  It is a croissant!  My brother-in-law has been picking up pastries from here for the whole fam for years.  He was our \"designated pastry driver\" so none of us had any idea what this place looked like or where it was.  Yesterday after a walk at Kiwanis my husband and I stopped in.  This place was SLAMMING!  But they are efficient and move you through in a polite but, \"Pick or get out of line\" manner.  If it takes you more than 20 seconds to pick a croissant flavor/filling, you can stand back and let others choose - sorry!  The decor was a bit... odd but I don't eat at breakfast places for the atmosphere.  Breakfast places are busy when they should be - at breakfast time - and I just go there to eat and get out.  If you want to lounge and savor every bite, go to dinner or go get a pre-packaged something from a coffee chain and sit all day.  I LOVED that we got there before what seemed to be the 10:15 rush.  We got the last of each of our croissants and they were DELISH!  I had V8 from the cooler and DH had OJ, so I can't comment on their coffee/espresso drinks.  Go in expecting New York politeness and have your mouth watering for a crisp-on-the-outside-delicious-on-the-inside croissant and you will be happy!"}
{"text":"Tired of the same old thing, my wife approached me one weekend morning and told me that she wanted croissants for breakfast.  Out comes the iPhone where I'm going to the Yelp app.  Yup, here we go, P. Croissants.  Nice, tidy place, with treats sweet and savory.  Why go to Burger King for their greasy croissants when you can get an egg, bacon and cheese croissant freshly made and tasty here?  Comparable price too.  If sugary stuff is what you're looking for, they've got it down.  You can get sweet crescents here made up like fancy donuts--many different kinds.  There's also salads and fruit pastries.  Fast, friendly service, surrounded by French ambiance..  The place is popular, so if you go at certain times, there might be a wait in line.  There's plenty of seating in and outside, though.  Next time you're in the mood for breakfast out, skip the pancakes and come to Pleaissant Croissant Patisserie, The Perfect Pastry."}
{"text":"The croissants here hit all the memories of Paris: tasty, buttery, flaky, and expensive. $30+ for a dozen is just too much for me, especially considering how little filling they have. I'm including a photo to show how flaky they are, but also how it's more like a hint of flavor than a filling."}
{"text":"This is a great locally owned spot. Fresh homemade food that is great! The staff was seriously nice, like good ol fashion nice. Trying to avoid a corporate setting? Go here!"}
{"text":"Looking for a crusty and delicious french pastry - P. croissant is your place. My one wish would just be a little more filling in the croissants. I just hope it wouldn't make it too sweet. The coffee was ok, but I really wanted it to be as good as the croissants. Its one of those places I could do once in a blue moon but after consecutive trips can get kind of old. Plus one time I went there were practically no croissants left -maybe it was busy morning, I will give them the benefit of the doubt, but I was a bit perturbed by my lack of choices. At any rate enjoy once in awhile - all those carbs and sugar are only good in moderation no matter how tasty."}
{"text":"Croissants are yum  Stopped in to grab some croissants.  Very pleasant and helpful service dude and the baked goods were yummers.  Standard fare overall.  Will revisit and order some meal options to rate again.  Place has potential and we want to try their French Onion Soup."}
{"text":"I had been CRAVING a Really Good Croissant for a long time!  I used to go to P.croissants back in the 80's/90's and I am sure they were owned by someone different then and the Croissants were AMAZING!  Then I went to day and more then likely will never go back!  I just got a Plain Croissant and brought it home and I was SO DISAPPOINTED!  It was not flaky at all and very LITTLE taste.  Not at all like I had remembered them to be.  As a side note if anyone is looking for the best Croissant's, HANDS DOWN, Williams and Sonoma!  You get them via mail order and they come frozen, set them out the night before and bake them and they are AMAZING, my holiday treat every year now.  Keeping a box around all year is dangerous!  I have found nothing to compare to them and looks like I will stick to them!"}
{"text":"It's just unfortunate that they are next to a fantastic french restaurant. It just does not compare and the croissants are OK. I mean i couldn't make them on my own.. but i will not be returning. There was nothing in here that calls to you and being the only ones getting helped and buying croissants there, it took a very long while to check out.  Not even service could save them...."}
{"text":"Top top notch bakery. I wasn't a huge fan of their muffins but the quiche and croissants are AMAZING. Hot chocolate is good, coffee is good. They're hot chocolate is made from Monin chocolate and milk so NO powdered junk!! I hate when places charge $3 for hot coco and I see some powdered stuff go into steamed milk. Not here it's super tasty!   The menu was a little hard to read, I did not see a printed menu that's the only reason for 4/5. They do have a diverse set of foods that are probably delicious, I've only stopped in for breakfasts.   I wanted to finally write a review because this morning I was short on change and the owner said \"bring it in next time\" and someone gave me the change! This is a great neighborhood place, I've seen a few repeat faces."}
{"text":"I'd say this is a good spot for breakfast pastries. However, I am not a fan of their lunch offerings. Staff are friendly and the decor is pleasant."}
{"text":"This place is soo great!! The music, food, ambiance, everything! It was our first time in and Seth greeted us right when we waked in the door, gave us a little mini tour of the menu, answered all of our questions and gave us some great recommendations. The staff was very friendly and everyone was very welcoming!"}
{"text":"Tired of the standard breakfast fare?  Stop by Pleaissant Croissants and pick up a dozen or so to bring to the office or treat yourself to just one.  They have a large variety of flavors.  If you bring an assortment to the office each is coded with a frosting doodle indicating what's inside.  These will make you a star, if you're late be a little bit later,  no one will notice."}
{"text":"Today's visit: definitely five star because of the apricot croissant.  I've always loved this place and was so glad I had a chance to stop by before moving to the Verde Valley. The service was good today too which was a nice surprise - the last time I was in it was  lethargic. I was greeted right away and the server was engaged and pleased to offer his products. As always, get there early if you want a good selection. I was there shortly after nine and the pickings were slim. This is actually one of those fortunately/unfortunately predicaments. Unfortunately, I had limited choices but fortunately because I have four or five favorites and I would've had to have had one of each. Again, the apricot croissant was outstanding. I'm trying to think of all the words I could use to describe it - there are many: light, flaky, and on and on."}
{"text":"I have worked across the street to this hot spot for 9 years.  I think I have had everything on their menu. I have never ever had a complaint on sandwiches or their really tasty salads.  Staff is friendly and is always very clean...  I will continue to enjoy the food here and hope that one day they will take me up on allowing me to do their hair.  I'm over at Salon 7000, next to the Vine."}
{"text":"I live near the place, have been there many times, and I wish I could love that place, but I can't. The croissants on their own are pretty good but the ingredients inside are okay at best, plus the take out orders are only accurate about half the time, the service is so so, and still I went back because I wanted to like that spot (i like croissants), but the last straw was my latest order for pickup when I asked about the ingredients of one of the croissants, the first guy was nice but did not know, had to ask the owner behind him who also did not know (?), he seemed very annoyed to be asked and grumbled that he had to check in the back which he did not do for another 10 minutes with me waiting in front of the register. Why did nobody know more about their own ingredients and why the rude standoffish attitude? I eventually left without an answer and without my order and promised myself I won't be back. I found out later that this cool croissant concept and business was created by a couple of Canadians that have left and sold it to the current owner. Sadly I don't think the passion is there for current management.   On the plus side, it is located right next to the Crepe bar which offers much higher quality food and excellent customer service."}
{"text":"Yummy food but definitely pricey. I still find myself coming back even though the service is usually very slow."}
{"text":"What a great little establishment!  My daughter and I stumbled upon this little gem a few days ago and not only is their food fresh and great tasting but they have excellent customer service.  The first day I had the croissant filled with boston cream and my daughter had the cheese danish....delish....the second day I split a savory croissant of ham and swiss with my daughter and it was even more delish.  I also had an iced mocha that was perfectly flavored.  I highly recommend this little spot."}
{"text":"I loved it here, the food was savory and delicious. The lemon croissant was flaky and perfect. I would of liked a little more icing because it was great."}
{"text":"If you read this review, please also read Nathan's comment below.  I hesitated to write a negative review about this place because I know it is local, but its food didn't taste local or homemade to me. I am not exaggerating when I say a breakfast sandwich from P.Crossant is no better than one from McDonalds.  Pre-made lumps of single-colored scambled egg, rubbery cheese, watery sausage patty, and a croissant that tastes like it has been refrigerated for days.  Not flaky, or buttery, or soft on the inside.  Kind of mashed down and a sickly yellow color.  Meanest review ever?  Sorry, P.Croissant!  But it's true.  I'll never go back."}
{"text":"\"Do you know on this one block you can buy croissants in five different places? There's one store called Bonjour Croissant. It makes me want to go to Paris and open up a store called Hello Toast.\"  ?  Fran Lebowitz  Woke up this morning to find some delicious croissants on the table and a mug of french-pressed Kona coffee all thanks to Mr. W.  This is how every morning should start off.  Being that it was a gorgeous Sunday morning, I sat down on the couch, dragged a throw blanket over my shoulders, ripped a croissant in half, and chewed on the most flaky and buttery croissant ever.  It was light, airy, and delicious.  I was lucky enough to grab a peanut butter filled one and had ended up splitting it with Mr. W.  Also to be tasted was a Bavarian cream filled croissant.  P.croissants has been Mr. W.'s favorite place for croissants growing up, seeing that his childhood home is down the street.  I'm glad he's decided to share this treat spot with me.  I would love to come back and try some of their sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Very fun treat. I pick them up for work occasionally. Raspberry croissants are really really good."}
{"text":"It's really just \"okay\". The food is mediocre and the coffee (I got a mocha latte) tasted like watered down hot chocolate. They had no croissants at all (I was there before noon) and they ran out of sandwiches completely, causing several customers to leave. I decided to stay and wait for the next batch (20 minutes). They forgot to give me something I ordered, so I had to order it and pay again, and then my sandwich came out wrong, so they had to remake it. They were apologetic, but that's all. Don't think they really go \"above and beyond\", they're just \"okay\"."}
{"text":"The actual croissants are good but only if you like plain ones. Very little filling in the sweet ones, and the breakfast ones are are frozen food tasting. Will not return!"}
{"text":"Last year my boss got boxes of croissants from here.  The different kinds were distinguished by a different symbols made in icing on top of the pastries.  I was hoping for a pan au chocolat, but the closest they had was chocolate chip (my boss got every flavor).  The croissants were decent, but there was nothing particularly special about them."}
{"text":"P. Croissants has the smell of a few cafes that I have been to in France.  I got a turkey avocado croissant and a to-go black cherry chocolate one.  The lunch one was a perfect size and the flaky and crisp texture of the croissant was excellent.  The sweet croissant was pretty good too.  It wasn't too rich or sweet as I may have anticipated, which is perfect.  There are not very many lunch spots in the nearby 2 miles radius, and you can count on coming here for great quality food."}
{"text":"Stopped by today for the first time to get a couple of breakfast sandwiches.  My husband ordered a bacon, egg and cheese with veggies and I got a egg, ham and cheese.  He also ordered a quiche florentine just to try.  Our sandwiches came out not as ordered.  My ham, egg and cheese had veggies and his bacon had none.  They were prompt to fix the mixup but the older gentlemen, I'm assuming owner, made it uncomfortably known he was not happy with his staff for the mistake.  The quiche was soggy and despite being loaded with veggies was surprisingly flavorless.  Our sandwiches also lacked flavor, the simple addition of salt and pepper to the egg would help this.  The croissant themselves had a floppy texture, not flaky and crisp like I would expect.  This visit was disappointing but maybe it was just an off day.  We live close by and I would still like to try their other croissants and coffee before I write them off completely."}
{"text":"Delicious croissant. It is absolutely fresh and delicious. We only ordered 3 to go because we were on the road. I will definitely come back here again"}
{"text":"What a sweet little find!    This small restaurant is located steps away from a very popular crepe restaurant.   Not to be dwarfed by that place,  P Croissant is big on taste,  service and options.   I went here on a Saturday,  pulled right up to the coffee bar and ordered a tasty cup of coffee.   The coffee ran out as I was pouring so the staff quickly filled the carafes.   Tasty coffee,  but that is not what makes this place special!   Tons and tons of freshly baked croissants.   Think of this as the Bagel shop of croissants.   So many different types of croissants,  from sweet to savory to spicy.   Then there are the sandwich options that are available.   I enjoyed a wonderful Croissant breakfast sandwich with veggies,  cheese and eggs.  I had taken a few bites and realized I didn't have the veggies.   I just asked them to brim then on the side,  but they insisted on making it over and making it right.   Awesome!     Great treat."}
{"text":"the croissants here were huge. felt healthier because they were less oily, but kind of plain looking and plain tasting."}
