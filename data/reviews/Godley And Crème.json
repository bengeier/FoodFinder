{"text":"This place is really beautiful, and has the most delicious treats and sandwiches! The scones and the granola bars are sooooo good, and the roasted veg sandwich is incredible! Everything is made in house and is very fresh. Definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"REALLY GOOD SANDWICHES. Great value for the price, too! I'll certainly be back."}
{"text":"Do not hesitate to try this wonderful little lunch place that does it right. Tasteful decor. Small terrace. Limited, chalkboard menu featuring daily super fresh lunches. Fresh juice/lemonade. Baked goods are total knock outs. Focaccia can be a little heavy handed on the oil, however, so it ends up feeling like a heavier lunch as it could be otherwise.

Rating Scale:
1 Star: Avoid the town in which this place is located just to be safe.  
2 Star: With so many great places to choose from, why risk this one?
3 Star: I'll try it again or consume here in a pinch.
4 Star: I go here regularly if financially and/or calorically feasible.
5 Star: I look forward to taking my wife or friends here."}
{"text":"Even if they are closed to public, They still sell their delicious pastries at other caf√©s, like Pikolo on Ave. du Parc, Flocon on Ave. du Mont-Royal... And I will keep you posted if I find them elsewhere."}
{"text":"Let me open with: perfect service.

I've never ever had someone serve me a coffee, then tell me if its not perfect to tell him and he'd replace it immediately. And it was perfect, so no need, but how awesome a feeling is that?

My friend also got scones here, which smelled incredible and I'll probable come back for tomorrow.

Very cool/quaint vibe, nice location, and again, great coffee and service!"}
{"text":"I had breakfast here while staying down the road on a visit to Montreal.  The owners are the loveliest people and basically they just ask you want you want for breakfast... as if you are guests in their kitchen.  The food is delicious and the portions generous.  The perfect (tiny) breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"Really cute and nice little place to stop to meet a friend. The staff were so sweet. Only problem was that a few things we ordered were no longer available, but everything we got was very fresh. So good :)"}
