{"text":"Good, quick food in a great location. I've been eating here for years, and though the chicken quality varies and bold flavor is lacking, you can't go wrong with the combination platter of bourbon chicken, mixed vegetables, and lo mein. You can always count on this place to provide lots of food for some of the lowest prices in oakland. 

There's plenty of outdoor seating and often musical entertainment in the summer. The bubble tea is a refresher during the hottest days, and they also provide fountain drink refills for a quarter. 

Convenient, good value, and pleasant staff."}
{"text":"Review is based on bubble tea and service.

A friend recommended this place to me when we were talking about bubble tea, so one day after work I went! The cashier was very knowledgeable on the bubble tea menu - I asked which ones didn't have dairy because I'm vegan. He went through the whole menu, pointing out which ones did and which ones didn't! I appreciated it a lot. In the end, I bought honeydew with bubbles. The drink itself was delicious, but the bubbles were kind of hard, not chewy and warm like what I was expecting. Would possibly come back for their food, but definitely for the drink!"}
{"text":"Very friendly and quick service!

always fresh food! Plus close to the Library.

Been going here for years!"}
{"text":"Asia Tea House is fast and simple. You order and then give you your food within ten minutes. It's ideally located and the food is delicious. The best part is that it's cheap! I had a combo with chicken and green beans, white rice and steamed vegetables for $6. There was enough food for two meals (which is great if you're a college student). I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner, got the Tofu in Curry sauce, vegetable spring roll, and fried rice. The curry sauce was not as spicy as I would have liked, but was fine after I added Sriracha. The fried rice was nice, nothing extraordinary, but the vegetable spring rolls are delicious. You get a large amount of food for an amazing price, excellent for college students. The food itself is average nothing special, but a great value for the price. In terms of spice I had to add Sriracha to everything to add some spicy flavor to the food. 

Overall great place and you definitely get your money's worth."}
{"text":"Couldn't imagine asking more out of an outdoor food kiosk. Good Pink Rose bubble tea and the Bourbon Chicken was surprisingly fresh. I'm used to Chinese chicken tasting so overcooked that it becomes a mushy rubber, but this still was recognizable as chicken and was stringy when pulled apart."}
{"text":"They serve the typical American Chinese food here. It's not bad; each entree comes with fried or white rice and sides. There is a wait, but it's not bad.

I also ordered a mango bubble tea. Unfortunately, it was loaded with sugar and not that good. This isn't the place to get bubble tea (I prefer Rose Tea Cafe). 

There are tables and chairs nearby, which are great when the weather's nice."}
{"text":"Ordered the green tea matcha bubble tea. It comes in one size only and cost around $4. They do have a minimum $2 purchase if you want to use a credit card. The taste was alright. I found it a little bit too watery and bland. An ideal bubble tea for me would be more matcha powder with a creamier taste."}
{"text":"Asia Tea house definitely has the best location in Oakland. Right in the heart of Schenley Plaza you can order and sit in the park. Asia Tea House is one of the few places in Oakland that provides authentic Asian food for a good price. The menu is offered is extensive and ranges from Sushi to General Tso's. Combination meals of meat and two sides seems to be a very popular choice. For an extra dollar, they offer double meat."}
{"text":"Pros:
-Rice to content ratio in sushi is great
-Portion sizes are great and a good bang for your buck
-As mentioned, good prices
-Rice noodles in soup are really nice
-Lo Mein has plenty of flavor
-Seafood soup is packed with scallops, crab (real crab) and scallops)
-great for college students due to large portion size and low prices

Con
-sushi lacks flavor. The California roll and Boston roll, for example, lack flavor. The cucumber has the most flavor, even with soy sauce. They skimp on eel in eel rolls. Spicy tuna is OK, not the best
-Seafood Soup lacks flavor
-portions for sides are very small
-most items lack flavor
-can take a bit for order to be done"}
{"text":"Tried the entree besides \"daily special\". It's way better. The corn tastes like its sweetened, but I'm not sure. The food is overall sweeter than other restaurant."}
{"text":"This is the absolute worst food I've had in the city. I realize that it is probably meant to be just quick, Americanized Chinese food. But even in that category, it's not good. My veggies were too greasy to eat, the rice was flavorless, and my sesame chicken had so much fat and gristle, I threw most of it away. I tried my friends' dishes, which were all similarly bad. If you're just hanging in Schenley, and hungry, go next door to the awesome Conflict Kitchen, or down the street to the surprisingly good cafeteria at Phipp's (you don't have to pay for admission to eat there). If you want quick, cheap Chinese food, this is not the place to get it, y'all. But get a bubble tea. Those are delightful."}
{"text":"Tasty, healthy, and fresh food at inexpensive price! 
Food is not salty as most Chinese food in US I had, actually the flavor is close to my back home! Highly recommand it!"}
{"text":"I am not happy with Asia Tea House.

It was a hot day, and I was feeling optimistic. So I decided to order a bubble tea. I went with the mango fresh fruit. Then the wait began. 

... Fifteen minutes later the guy hands me my smoothie. I took a sip. This was followed by a frown. Another sip was necessary to make sure I was not just imagining things. Yep. This was the worst smoothie I had ever tasted. And I have had a lot of bubble teas in my day. Forget the fresh fruit. It was too watered down to be identified as a mango smoothie. And the tapioca balls were tough and bland. I had just paid $4 for water and crappy tapioca balls.

The search for good boba tea in Pittsburgh continues."}
{"text":"Asia Tea House sucks. You're better off at Oishii Bento. Food is absolutely inedible -- DISGUSTING. I ordered sesame chicken and fried rice. The chicken is dark meat and becomes chewy in your mouth. It's very unnappetizing and you end up having to spit it out. Bubble tea is fine. This place is a waste of money and time. Schenley Park tourist trap."}
{"text":"Kind of bland for Chinese food.. I will go here if I have to when I am visiting Pittsburgh but only if I'm in a rush!"}
{"text":"Freshman year, I tried someone's bubble tea from here and swore I was never going to eat at this place (their tapioca pearls were atrocious), however..

I've seen maaaany people get food from here and a part of me always thought.. have I been missing out? Me and a friend walk past it several times a week, and this time, their daily special caught our eyes. 1 entree 2 sides for $7? Or 2 entrees 1 side for $8? If you're craving some American-Chinese food that's: fast, under $10, and weather's nice, I won't judge. 

VEGGIE TOFU + ORANGE CHICKEN + LO MEIN ($8): Lowkey good and they give a lot. You can say it's not real Chinese food and I'll agree with you on that. But you can't say that it's still not tasty. I do have to say that I wished the lo mein had more vegetables, as it was literally all noodles and was actually quite bland. Veggie tofu I thought lacked flavor too, but the zucchini and carrots were yummy and nicely cooked. Orange chicken is my guilty pleasure and in my meal I actually saw a cooked orange peel that I thought was funny. Well I know that they use actually oranges now..

SERVICE: Quite fast! Well. Me and the friend came here around 11 after class when they literally just opened for the day so I'd hope that they wouldn't be slow LOL. They also offer condiments like soy sauce and duck sauce. It's not laying out but I specifically asked for hot oil and they gave it to me. Yum yum yummmmm. 

Asia Tea House, cheap, very 'American-Chinese', just \"meh\" for me. If you're looking for authentic and not as cheap, try Hunan Bar or Sichuan Gourmet."}
{"text":"Asia Tea House is super conveniently located- I'd come here all the time, even if the food wasn't good. The spring rolls and vegetarian tofu is always top notch. The veggies are cooked well and the portions are huge. I love trying all the different bubble teas here. 

The only word of caution I have is that the General Tso's tofu here just flat out isn't General Tso's. It's honestly just watery nonsense, so if you're going for tofu, get the vegetarian tofu instead."}
{"text":"I had to visit yelp to see if I could have been forewarned how the bubble tea is NOT good. Granted it was my first time here and I only ordered one thing,totally ruined the mood for laying out in the sun, sipping on a cold bubble tea while reading a book. I ordered the pink rose tea - if ur a bubble tea fanatic (I'm from LA) definitely not what I was expecting. I can't really put into words what is this hot pink neon drink with only eight tapioca balls in it :( I'm too disappointed with this one to see if the green tea or taro tea would be any better..."}
{"text":"It's in such a great location. We ordered food and sat right by the lawn in Schenley Plaza overlooking the Cathedral of Learning. They produce mostly stereotypical American Chinese food, sushi, and bubble tea.There's a large menu and many people hesitate outside the window thinking about what they want to get.

We ordered pork dumplings as a shared appetizer and an entree for each of ourselves. The food is what you would expect from a Panda Express or any random non-authentic Chinese place in the US. But it's convenient, and the view is hard to beat. After chowing down Chinese food you can walk around the area, and maybe get some dessert from the nearby waffle place. A perfect three-course meal made."}
{"text":"The food is just okay, but there are much better options for Chinese food. The bubble tea is not vey good, I've had much better in Pittsburgh. The location is great, it's right in the Schenley Plaza, so you can eat on the lawn or under the tent. But the food is just filling, nothing very special at all."}
{"text":"Reasons to eat here: 
1. Good food and perf ft portions. 
2. The mango mango berry smoothie (you can add tapioca pearls for $0.50) is delicious. It's sweet without the overkill, and the consistency is always perfect; never watery or chunky. 
3. Fast friendly service
4. The prices are very agreeable

Basically if you enjoy being satisfied you'll enjoy dining here."}
{"text":"If you're really craving Chinese or Sushi and don't have time to visit another place, then sure, come here. The food is just okay- it won't blow you away and everything I've ever tried here and is just missing something. Their chicken lo mein is meh- even with taking it home to doctor it up, it still just didn't impress me. Their sweet potato tempura sushi is ok, but it sure isn't memorable. There are a few things to like about this place: 1) it's affordable, 2) it's convenient for college students to get to, 3) there's always outside seating available. Overall though, if you are looking for delicious Sushi or Chinese, I would recommend not coming here."}
{"text":"Asia Tea House was pretty good because of the amazing set of atmosphere. I had a mango bubble tea and it was dull with flavor in comparison to the pineapple bubble
Tea. I would probably come back to try their Asian Food (which looks amazing). But for now I will stick with a 3 of 5..."}
{"text":"Good bubble tea.  I got the Mango bubble tea.  It was definitely unique since it used Mango juice rather than just Mango green tea.  I liked it a lot.  A lot of funky juice bubble teas are sold there although if you're expecting a traditional one, don't go here."}
{"text":"I stopped here in August when my band was on tour. We decided to busk in the plaza before our show that night, and I needed some food that didn't come from the cooler in our van. Not wanting a huge portion of food and trying to eat healthy, I took a change on a roll of sushi and a seaweed salad. I thought that since I didn't order anything that needed to be cooked, it wouldn't take too long. After waiting for way longer than is necessary to make sushi, they told me they were out of seaweed salad and offered me a replacement or a refund (of which I took the latter). Again, I waited a pretty ridiculous amount of time and eventually got my roll. It was tiny, but it tasted alright. Employees were nice. All in all, about what you might expect from a tiny Asian food stand next to the plaza. Probably wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"The taro bubble tea had nice flavor but there were chunks of ice in it. I feel like it probably is frozen somewhere ahead of time and not made fresh there which is disappointing."}
{"text":"You fail. I can't even review your bubble tea bc WE NEVER RECEIVED IT! You said it would take about 5 minutes to get your fake bubble tea to us(which is to long), but what is five minutes. 5 minutes turned to thirty minutes which turned to us telling you to give our money back. Cute comment you made that you meant Chinese 5 minutes. I will take my money and write this post."}
{"text":"I had the Thai tea bubble tea. I never knew bubble tea could be this bad until I tried it here. I usually get from Fuku Tea and in comparison there was no flavor and it was obvious they didn't use fresh tea/milk, or fresh tapioca. Yuck."}
{"text":"I met a friend in Schenley Plaza since she has been away in New York the last couple of weeks. Even though Bobby was at home making dinner and I'm dieting, I still was hungry and needed food. 

I ordered the teriyaki chicken from Asia Tea House. The counter guy was nice and my food took long enough to know that it was fresh. It definitely was not the worst chinese that I have had."}
{"text":"I've only been to Asia Tea House once but it was enough to put me off for the rest of my time in Pittsburgh. This was the first place in the city that I went to for bubble tea because of it's convenient location. The bubble tea there was a huge disappointment, though. My friend ordered a strawberry smoothie and I ordered a matcha (green tea) bubble tea. Both were pretty bland, the strawberry one was probably worse. The matcha bubble tea did have the flavor of green tea, but was still quite watered down. Nothing like the bubble tea I've had in Philadelphia. Huge disappointment. The food here might be cheap and good, haven't tried it myself so I can't vouch for it, but if you're looking for bubble tea close to Pitt's campus, try Craig Street."}
{"text":"The shrimp teriyaki here = 70% hard rice that's going to cause you indigestion + 15% sad-looking broccoli + 5% shrimps with freshness that's questionable + 10% sauce that doesn't even taste like teriyaki."}
{"text":"If you keep in mind that this is essentially outdoor takeout/fast food Chinese/Japanese then you won't be disappointed.  If you are expecting authentic and gourmet, you will be.

The menu has bubble teas and smoothies, sushi, dumplings and an assortment of other Americanized dishes.  I tried the bubble tea and fried pork dumplings.  Prices were about what I expected them to be for the location.  It took longer than it should have for a simple order, but it was fairly crowded because it was a gorgeous day.  

I'm not a bubble tea connoisseur so I can't judge how it stacks up to others, but I enjoyed mine (as did the two others who we're with me).  It had a nice flavor that wasn't weak and it had a nice thickness.  

The dumplings were a nice size and cooked well.  The dough was thicker than it usually is on dumplings but they had a nice flavor.

Overall, not a bad option if you have an open mind."}
{"text":"How do I start?! Yelpers beware! The high reviews offered to this place are deceitful! This place is terrible.

Food: this is only reviews off the bubble tea because of previous reviews claiming it was great. Far from great it was! This watered down, tasteless, and sorry excuse for bubble tea puts all other bubble teas on top. Worst of all the bubbles tasted old and as if they were stored away all winter. Not fresh! In fact, our bubbles were more like giant balls stuck together. The tea was watery and lacked true flavor of mango or macha. What a dissappointment, however the people of the burgh wouldn't notice the difference. So fortunately for you, this is a good thing. 

Service: meh, slow and it seemed that they had no order in serving people.

Interior: it's outside, which was nice. 1 star given. 

Disclaimer: I drink lots of bubble tea, if you want a true experience go to Philly or Miami. They make a thicker juice with fresher bubbles."}
{"text":"This place is great for lunch in the park and the prices aren't bad either. I like the bourbon chicken, but sometimes it's a little dried out. The bubble tea is fantastic though! I like their bubble tea a lot more than LuLu's or Rose Tea Cafe's. I highly recommend the honeydew flavor. So good!"}
{"text":"Great cheap chinese on campus. Its not the best I ever had, but it is honestly better than most places in Oakland and Sq. Hill. I would take their chicken eggroll over any in town. Plus they are friendly and quick. Plus I love that you can get double vegetable sides instead of rice... Great for a lower calorie option. 
I would say that the bubble tea is \"meh\" at best."}
{"text":"they have a menu item described as Vegetarian in big bold letters on sign... but I was told all the food is made with oyster sauce. I asked if they could update sign. he said no all Chinese food is not vegetarian. What? lots of places in town.... and in China make vegan/vegetarian food."}
{"text":"This is the best bubble tea in Pittsburgh.  I usually get the matcha. The reason this bubble tea is the best is the authentic tea- unsweetened, and frothy and the tapioca bubbles are separate, not squished together like some  bubble tea places .   I live outside the city ,  but stop here whenever I am in Oakland."}
{"text":"Decent quick Chinese food in between classes. Price is cheap, haven't had a bad meal yet."}
{"text":"I was here on a nice sunny day and had the bourbon chicken with green beans and fried rice. The chicken and rice were both decent, but the beans were a little on the bland side, which I guess is fine for a side dish. Though the food from this place is pretty average, the large portions combined with the outdoor atmosphere makes for a pretty good experience. Schenley Plaza is always a nice place to be at on a good day because of the available seating and the nice breeze that seems to run through the area. 
Location is everything for this place, I don't think I would've ventured here if it was a restaurant say on Craig, but the nice roadside feel made me wanna check it out."}
{"text":"Hit or miss for me. 

The most popular American Chinese foods, like sesame chicken or general tso's chicken are usually prepped in advanced, so the quality is diminished. These chicken dishes have a ton of breading on them also, and are way too submerged in sauce. 

I tried the Lo Mein too, and it was extremely salty on its own, so I was disappointed. 

The bubble tea is also really watery. 

However, the service is pretty fast. 

If you're really craving American Chinese food, and want to enjoy Schenley Plaza, go for it, but it's not that special."}
{"text":"Bubble tea available here!"}
{"text":"My favorite place in Oakland to get Chinese food takeout. I love their teriyaki chicken with fried rice! The chicken is cooked well and covered in their sweet teriyaki sauce. There is also a lot of rice. The steamed broccoli is pretty standard. I drizzle some sriracha on it and then take it to the library across the street. This meal will for sure keep you full for a while. I also have had their spicy bourbon chicken and lo mein which is pretty good too. Reminds me of classic chinese food in the mall."}
{"text":"Food: the lunch combos are a great deal at $6.50 for a main and two sides. I usually get chicken and broccoli with fried rice and vegetables. It's good for when you're really hungry and meeting a friend on a nice day, but I wouldn't go there for any real occasion. Mostly this place is great for the location on schenley plaza. I don't think it would do as well if it was just a regular restaurant. 

Bubble tea: NO. As a certified bubble tea lover I cringe when I see people holding cups from ATH. This is not bubble tea, people. The bubbles are chewy and overcooked with no flavor, and few and very far between. A weird froth tends to develop as you near the bottom of the cup, which is disconcerting to say the least. Please please please do not even call what you are drinking bubble tea. It disgraces the honorable name of the thing."}
{"text":"I was never really a huge fan of Asia tea house, but in the past couple of months I've gone a couple of times and they've met my expectations for a cheap American-Chinese food restaurant. I usually get the general tso's chicken with lo mein and the green beans.

General tso's chicken is sometimes over cooked and super hard, but the flavor is good, just wish it was easier to chew. (Other friends recommend the orange chicken). Lo mein doesn't have any veggies or anything in it, it's just noodles. But the green beans are freaking delicious and fresh every single time, so I recommend getting that as a side. (They're also pretty veggie friendly - my friend asked them if they could do a general tso's tofu and they happily obliged). 

I've had their bubble tea before and I'm not really a fan. I have friends who really enjoy their taro and matcha bubble tea, but I've never enjoyed any of the ones I've gotten from here.

It's cheap and in a convenient location. Quality is probably higher than Szechuan in Oakland, but you don't get as much food."}
{"text":"I ordered their chicken teriyaki with friend rice and original black milk bubble tea.

The chicken teriyaki was good in that the portions were huge (more than a chipotle bowl if you're looking for a comparison), especially the fried rice. And the chicken was nice and mostly soft. However, the vegetables and egg in the fried rice were a bit lacking in that there were only a few pieces of chopped carrots, egg, peas, and even less egg. Also, unless you're seriously hungry, you'll definitely have some to save for leftovers.

Their bubble tea, compared to Fuku, had tapioca bobas (also called pearls) that were smaller and harder to chew with a lack of flavor to them. The liquid was sliiiiightly more thicker. What was odd to me was the 1/2 inch of froth on top of it but that was probably from them shaking/stirring (James Bond pls tell me the difference if there is one) the liquid to make it thicker, but the drink quickly lost its texture so I don't think it was worth the froth in my opinion. So next time, I'll be avoiding their bubble tea because of its lack of quality.

Tl;dr: go for the food (b/c of their portions in regards to meat & rice, a 4 star) but not their bubble tea (a 1 star)."}
{"text":"This place has pretty quick service (order at one window and pick up at the next window). The food is definitely not very authentic, but in my opinion it's pretty good Americanized Chinese food. The fried rice was nicely flavored, the steamed vegetables were not too raw or overcooked, and the garlic sauce chicken was tender. The size of the meal was a good deal for the price you pay. There's no indoor seating, but there's plenty of outdoor seats. Also, on the warmer days it's very nice to bring a blanket and eat on the lawn."}
