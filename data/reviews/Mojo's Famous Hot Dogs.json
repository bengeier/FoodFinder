{"text":"These are the best hot dogs I've had in a long time. Mojo's Famous is very good. I highly recommend going."}
{"text":"Found this spot on the way home from work one day when I was hungry. And to my surprise the hot dogs were real good the chili is excellent. Can't go wrong for the price."}
{"text":"Best hot dogs in the city. Really good smoked sausages also. Phenomenal customer service and all around nicest guy ever."}
{"text":"Easy in/out roadside set up on Statesville Rd . . . just look for the beach umbrella.  Great dogs, brats, and sausages with toppings.  Nothing gourmet here, just a good ol' hot dog stand.  I grabbed a jumbo dog with a Coke and got change back from a five.  Taste was perfect . . . just the way I like.  I say, \"Give 'em a whirl!\""}
{"text":"Just went for the 1st Time and it was great. I ordered two beef hot dogs. One all of the way and the other with Chile and cheese."}
{"text":"Hard to beat a good cart dog cooked on an actual fire by a real live person and since there's not even an actual place there's no place to hide an inferior product: no fake memorabilia, no fake music, no fake news, no beer (crafty or otherwise). Mojo's has more less than you can shake a stick at so the man and the menu have to carry the show... Maurice is a trooper: rain or shine he's out hustling hot dogs, chips, and soda. He's pleasant and cheerful and will share a few adjectives while preparing your foods. Spending 24 of my 30 lunch-minutes heading down and back on Statesville Road to get a little something is not such a bad thing, especially when it's lightly charred and served with mustard, onions, and relish."}
{"text":"Ashamedly, my foodie side and healthy side are at war one million times a day. 98% of the time my healthy side chooses veganism. But rarely, my foodie-ism completely smacks my desire to maintain a healthy lifestyle and the veganism in the face. Today was one of those days. I've been looking at Mojo's longingly on Yelp because unlike most vegans, I actually still crave meat and think it smells delicious even if it makes me sick as all hell when I eat it.   Moreover, I'm a sucker for certain meats when executed flawlessly, namely ribeyes, Eastern NC barbecue and hotdogs especially when the weather breaks. I'm such a summer baby and these are foods I nostalgically associate with summer cookouts, GOOD potato salad, strawberries , and watermelon ! Yummy !!   So today, the combination of 73-degree weather after four rainy days, end of semester stress, geographic location and timing finally broke me/smiled on me and I was able to visit Maurice aka Mo at Mojo's right as he was about to pack up for the day. There on the grill sat a beautiful red hot dripping in oily, juicy goodness and shining like a diamond  in the sky . After chatting with the congenial Mo, I opted for the beef smoke with homemade chili, mustard and a sprinkle of diced grilled onions, per his suggestion.   My rule of thumb is, \"If I'm going to commit a transgression against the plant-based lifestyle, it better be damn worth it.\" And this juicy, beefy, chili-smothered delicacy was DAMN WORTH EVERY BITE times 1000.  This thing was so damn good that I picked up the paper and licked up every chili and onion crumb. I almost ate the paper just because of the residual, unclaimed deliciousness left but I figured it wouldn't be a good idea, even if it is plant-based.   I would venture to say this is the most well-executed hot dog ever. I've eaten all styles of hot dogs from a lot of places. Admittedly, it rivals The Big Apple's signature dogs that are so good all they need is a strip of mustard. It really is that good. Mo thought of every detail down to the ratios of each ingredient. The bun was New England style and fluffy. The smoke was perfectly grilled and juicy with the perfect amount of \"snap\". The chili was a flavorful, tender all beef mixture with just the right amount of sauce.The onions were perfectly grilled and the perfect size and the perfect amount of yellow mustard topped it off. All of the ingredients formed a beautifully, perfect marriage of flavors.  This place is worth a trip (even from out of town to try). As the previous reviews stated, Mojo's is located in front of a vacant brick building in a pothole-filled parking lot on Statesville Ave (two doors down from Bojangles headed away from I-85 toward Cindy Lane) but the quality and service are worth all five stars and a few extra .  If you're going to go off the rails with your diet or lifestyle this place is worth it. Don't miss out on this gem. It just may be the best hot dog you will ever eat."}
{"text":"Stopped by MoJo's to get some hotdogs, 2 all the way. And they where Awesome!! The chilly is on point! Will stop by again."}
{"text":"Really good great price is just on side of the road. Tried the dogs abd brauts both were perfect. Chili is also realy good i recommend it."}
{"text":"Love at first bite. Hotdogs are either a hit or miss for me and this is definitely a hit. My coworker's put me on this place and have been eating here for years and it is no wonder why.  Mo's dogs are cooked in a cast iron skillet and topped with whatever your heart desires. Your choices are a hot dog, jumbo hot dog, brats or smokes. I have only had the hot dog and smoke and boy oh boy, they just make my mouth water. I don't know if it is the skillets he uses which offer flavorings to the dogs, if it is the brand he uses or maybe it is a combination of both - whatever it is, I love those suckers. Yes, LOVE.  My favorite toppings are slaw, ny style onions and chili. But mix and match your heart's desire and this dog will still be one of the best you have ever had! Trust and Believe that when I have friends come and visit, I will make sure that they get one of these before they leave!"}
{"text":"Excellent Hot Dogs!! Cooked fresh on the fire with real chili and tangy slaw. You can't be the price."}
