{"text":"We had our December Wedding at Roses Run Country Club and we couldn't have pulled it off - in just three months - without the incredible customer service of event coordinator Meghan and chef Janet.   We live out of state but grew up in Kent. We wanted to hold our wedding and reception back home, and it was important to us to work with local vendors - not an easy feat when planning a party for nearly 200 from afar. But every step of the way, Meghan and Janet were flexible, patient and accommodating as we brainstormed ideas, made very specific requests and proposed last-minute changes.  The value for the money was fantastic!  Meghan was responsive, professional, friendly, creative and very easy to work with. Her entire focus was on ensuring that our day was exactly as we wanted it, and, with Meghan in charge, we never worried about whether our ceremony and reception would reflect us or whether our needs would be met. She put together a fantastic team, and our guests universally praised the service, the d√©cor and, across the board, the food.  When we first met with Janet to discuss the menu, she said: \"I won't let you down.\" She kept that promise - even though we didn't make it easy on her! We wanted a sit-down meal with four options for entrees. We also had guests with specific dietary restrictions and more than two dozen picky-eating kids attending. At every step, Janet adjusted. Both the food and presentation were wonderful.  Our only negative feedback has nothing to do with the service or staff. Rather, it has to do with the venue itself. RRCC is located in a great place and has really good space for events of all sizes. But we've watched over the years as the venue has suffered from a lack of upkeep, and that's unfortunate. The site would benefit greatly from a bit of TLC, including replacing the worn, outdated carpeting, fixing cracked windows, improving the locker rooms/staging area and updating the pub area generally. It also would benefit from clear signage from the parking lot to the banquet area so event-goers know how to get to the right place.  Despite some of those venue drawbacks, we had a great experience entirely because of Meghan and Janet."}
{"text":"Had an unfortunate event occur here where we were falsely and rudely accused of sneaking beer into our golf bags in the parking lot. I understand they have a liquor license to protect but the way the whole situation was handled was very unprofessional. I'm not going to go into depth with what happened but this event upset me to the point of where I will never return to play here, which is unfortunate because I used to play a majority of my golf games here.... and I play a lot of golf. Not a smart move on them from a business standpoint, especially for a business that already struggles with sales."}
{"text":"My daughter just had both her wedding and reception here and we had an amazing experience working with Meghan and staff!  Meghan really handled all the details beautifully.  From walking everyone through rehearsal to acting as liaison between vendors, Meghan was such a pro at handling it all in such a calm fashion!  The food was very good- many compliments from guests.  The venue was gorgeous and set up exactly as we planned.  Would highly recommend this venue!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars, I would. Very unwelcoming golf course. We were reprimanded for  taking too long and someone in our party drove on the green. I understand that's a mistake and we corrected them before we were stopped by the ranger. Well, the ranger stopped over to us DRIVING ON THE GREEN. He proceeded to sit there and watch us as we were continuing to play and would not leave us alone because we were \"taking too long\". He treated us disparagingly with zero respect. We even let people pass us! I am very understanding that people pay money to own a membership here but we came for a business golf outing and bottom line, we paid money to play. We had one person out of our whole party who wasn't very good at the game and took a little longer than someone who is apt at golfing. We left and we couldn't even get our money back! It's a shame because the course is absolutely beautiful! But do not come here if you aren't a member as you are not made to feel welcome. They clearly don't care about growing anymore business for themselves. So sad..."}
{"text":"We had my future daughter-in-law's bridal shower here and it was excellent.  Maghen was terrrific and was good to keep me on task.  Life happens and thank goodness she worked so well with me about counts, food, set-up.  It was wonderful that a friend of mine booked a bridal show for August the next day!!  The servers were so nice and never interrupted the event, but magically picked up dishes and served cake.  Very, very pleased with the venue and staff!!  Book your shower here!!"}
{"text":"We will never return.  Which is sad because we like the course.  When we called for a tee time we were originally told the computer was down and they would call us back.  They did and gave us a 9:04am.  When we got there and payed we found that tee time had also been given to another large group.  We had to tee off on the back 9 where we had to go through the sprinklers that were turned on AS we were playing.  Then whe we did get to the front it was stacked up and we had to wait 5 to 10 minutes between shots.  Clean up your act, gentlemen."}
