{"text":"Cappleman's is definitely the best Fish And Chip shop in Scarborough. Just a poor location in my eyes. Best Quality Fish though. Well worth a trip. Use the QYPE map to find it though!"}

{"text":"Overrated chippy in my opinion."}
{"text":"A local legend that has managed to keep its' head above the water in recent austere times. It has been a few years since I used it and last night I had two fish and chips with peas at Â£9.80 total. Not a bad price. What struck me straightaway here was the efficiency of the place. I was asked what I would like as I joined the back of the queue. As I got to the front it was ready. The chips were fresh crispy on the outside and fluffy in the middle. The fish was very tasty. The portion was just right and did not overwhelm me or leave me bloated. Opening times are lunch 1130-130 except Sun/Mon and tea 430-900 except on Sat 430-730. Recommended"}
