{"text":"Simple pub fare, but good portions and good tasting.  Beer is ice cold, and frequent live music.  A local favourite!"}
{"text":"Small Tavern (not a pub) in a small town.  Food is pretty great...specifically the wings and fresh cut fries.  The place need some serious renovations. Not the cleanest looking place...loads of potential."}
{"text":"We always drove past but never thought of going in. When we did we were surprised how good the food was. You get good sized portions with the great tasting pub food. I suggest you try the wings. We will definitely keep going back."}
{"text":"This place is a little rough around the edges but has so much history it just suits the experience. Wings & appetizers are great! My great grandmother told me stories when she was young, when she used to come up from Toronto to visit this place, so 4 generations later.. we still love it's character in Beeton! Yummy food & good service!"}
{"text":"Came by The Muddy Waters for a beer and some wings and left satisfied.   My friend and I walked in to this pub and found only two other tables occupied,leaving the seating selection open. The place is a big one, good for larger parties. We perused the menu and settled on the wing combo each. A mini platter with garlic bread, a pound of wings and fries. I remember the flavours being perfect for the garlic bread and really enjoying my wing sauce flavour. The price wasn't too shabby either considering how much grub we ordered.   While paying, the bartender gave us a bit of history about the place. It is the original building from WWII where they would accept wayward girls and house them upstairs. I thoroughly love dining and learning about the history of the buildings/surroundings/owners.   If you can get past the slight smell from the older building, then you're set. The wings were really yummy and the beer quenched my thirst."}
