{"text":"We were very happy when we found this little place. Better prices & quality of food than downtown Calgary. * Quick friendly service * Small Place. Maybe seats 30 people * Rolls are fresh, flavorful and full * Very reasonable price and lower price than we expected * Beef and Chicken Yakisoba have great flavor and are big portions * Spicy Crunch Tuna Rolls amazing and only $8.95 * We have had a whole variety of rolls and comparable goodness to sushi on the west coast * Calamari is not my style - thin dry crunchie coating but it must be meant to be that way. Have had the same way of preparation in other Japanese restaurants.  * I have been craving going back all week.  * Going to keep a menu in my car for take out * My kids: Elem, Jr.High & Sr. High loved it. * Like that I am supporting a small family business. Will be going back... again & again."}
{"text":"I was a fan of this place up until recently. Although their lunch bentos indicate on their menu that its M-F, we have have always been able to get this on the weekend. A few weeks ago, cause we were 1 min past 2:30 they would not let us to order. There was no one else inside. We decided to stay since we were starving.  The second time , we went there at noon on a sunday. Drove from the south just to go. There was only 1 table inside. New waitress indicated that bentos were just M-F. So I told her we've been getting this since they opened, she asked the chef and we were told oh bentos are just not avail on sundays now. This time we left.  We've gone numerous times on the weekend and the place is dead inside. Every single sushi place offers lunch combos on the weekend, its your busiest time. Why wouldn't you? Considering its dead inside, you'd think they would want the business instead of loosing it. Won't ever return."}
{"text":"By far one of my favourite sushi place! Coming from  Vancouver, it's been tough to find a decent restaurant.  My sister and I ordered the garden salad, spicy tuna sashimi, dynamite roll, tobiko and negitoro roll. It was sooooo good!  Service was great! Although, they did charge us for tea @ $1.00/p. I'm not used to getting charge for tea. I'm taking my whole family here next time around!"}
{"text":"I tried Kimu today for dinner and was happy with the food.  We had the soft tofu salad, Yam Roll, a appetizer roll I can't remember the name, and I believe it was a dragon roll. I loved the yam roll, it was great with the fried shredded yam on top.  The staff was great and was there when we needed them.  Too bad we got stuffed and couldn't try the fried ice cream. Guess there is always next time!"}
{"text":"This spot is near my house and I wasn't sure what to expect. I am a vegan, so I don't eat fish - but still love my veggies and vegetable rolls. The rolls I had were delicious and fresh! One of the favourite fruit/veggie combos I've had. The service was good, and I defiantely could have ordered more to take home! Great little unassuming spot."}
{"text":"Tiny place with excellent and reasonably priced sushi. Generously sized lunch special bento boxes are delicious. Sushi rice holds together nicely even after dipping in wasabi and soy sauce. Teriyaki Beef is very tender and the sauce is amazing."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing service, quality and variety!  Unique twists on classic favourites and huge portion sizes!"}
{"text":"Finally, a brilliant sushi place! I m sharing this as I don't want them to leave.... ever! We went there after reading other Yelp reviews and were not disappointed.  The staff are friendly and attentive. The sushi is the best I've had in Calgary. We ordered sashimi, which were big pieces and served on ice, the rolls were huge and interesting combinations. We also had gyoza, which were light and very fresh. The prices are the going rate, but you definately get your bang for your buck. Sorry Kinjo, you have been replaced!"}
{"text":"I tried this place out with a group of friends. It's a cute, small little spot that probably does most of its business on word of mouth.  They have a pretty extensive sushi menu. I appreciate they describe things well - if you aren't a sushi expert you get a good idea of what all the options are about.  Presentation wise the sushi and the rolls are stunning. Portions are good and pricing is very reasonable. They have traditional options as well as some more modern \"out there\" creations. Things are well made and everything was fresh tasting - pretty important with sushi, right?  Service was kinda all over the place. It took awhile to get everyone place settings. They were quick however to extend out table when it became clear we ordered more food than would comfortably fit on the initial table space. The server didn't ask if we wanted beverage refills - their loss because we al probably would have had a second drink.  All in all this is a great little spot. I'll be back."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi place in Calgary. Food is prepared really well, delicacy. The sashimi has big cut, thick, really tasty. I will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Going to this place once a week. Good food and presentation! Running by Japanese family business."}
{"text":"I came here based on other reviews and was severely disappointed! Service was VERY slow and when the first of two rolls came out it was cold! Tasted like the fried calamari on top was microwaved from yesterday, then allowed to cool down. Waited another 15 minutes for my second roll and the scallops were supposed to be cooked but were cold and half way raw. I will not be returning!"}
{"text":"Amazing food!! good service! and good price!  I recommend the pineapple express and the chicken katsu!"}
{"text":"This is a quaint little place which serves very interesting rolls and is a great place for vegetarians also. The sushi I had here was fresh and always delicious. I have been here dozens of time and have never been disappointed, been here for lunch and dinner. I love their rolls and the ingredients for each roll. The only thing I hope for this place is that they expand their menu, more hot foods to choose from. The Sashimi is sliced thick which is great! Even for their lunch bento box. This place is a must try!"}
{"text":"This was the best sushi I have ever had in my entire life!!!! Fast and great service too. I highly recommend it"}
{"text":"Cozy place with friendly service and a great atmosphere. We ordered the Roll Combo along with the deep fried chicken cutlet that came with rice, salad and a tangy dipping sauce. The Roll Combo came out immediately however the chicken took a while to arrive at our table. Both dishes were delicious.   Overall, would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"This place is a little hidden gem. Food is good with big portion. Fish is fresh also. Ever since I and my boyfriend discovered this place, we've been coming here often whenever we crave for sushi."}
{"text":"Went here again recently and tried the sashimi. It was incredibly fresh and that is obviously key to good sashimi.   Will definitely go back sometime soon."}
{"text":"It is always good to have another sushi option in the area.  Decent sushi restaurants are hard to come by.  While not the best sushi I have had in the city, it is definitely one of the best in this part of the City. Service is also above par.  One down side to it is that it is a small restaurant so it doesn't accommodate large groups well.  It also does not take reservations if I remember right so be there if you would like a table."}
{"text":"We live fairly close to Sushi Kimu, but had never eaten there until today.  Decided to try it out, and it was well worth it.  Depending on how much you order, and how many people are eating will obviously change the cost, but I found the prices to be reasonable, and very good quality.  It was fresh, and very well made.  You get what you pay for in both Quality and Service!  The Tuna Tataki was the absolute best I've had compared to about a dozen other sushi restaurants I've tried it at, Sushi Kimu is now top of my list.  They have a good selection of rolls, individual sushi and sashimi, along with a lot of other good hot dishes on the menu.  Its a very small restaurant with less than a dozen tables, so orders will come out quick and efficiently, some of the larger sushi restaurants you spend more time waiting for food, than actually eating.  Here, we were in and out in under 40 minutes from the time we sat down to look at the menu, to paying for the bill.  It's Japanese Owned and Run too, very polite and friendly staff.  Will most definitely be coming here many more times.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The service was good but we were the only ones at 11:30 am today when they first opened, and by 12:30 all tables were taken.  The sushi is meh and not the quality and presentation I'm accustomed to.  Rolls were poorly done and falling apart, larger quantity of mushy rice, cut unevenly.  The appearance on the tuna sashimi didn't appear that fresh.  We wanted to try it because of the reviews but won't be coming back, we'll go to our usual Shabuya cause we're never disappointed there."}
{"text":"After moving from the West Coast to Banff then to Calgary, I had almost given up hope for inexpensive/delicious sushi and sashimi. My boyfriend and I are lucky to have found this place so close to our home. We've ordered the caterpillar rolls, marinated short ribs, and deluxe sashimi. The portions were great and the sashimi was exceptionally outstanding! Despite the sashimi being almost $20.00 the cuts were generous and they even give you red tuna! The space is small so not good for big groups but cozy enough for a couple or with close friends."}
{"text":"The bento is the best lunch invention after sliced bread. Kimu has them M-F for lunch and I go here every once in a while when I have a craving for bentos  You get a decent amount of food for $12.95. It comes with edamame, dumplings, sushi and one other item.   The restaurant is owned and operated by a Korean family which explains the hints of Korean inspired flavors. For example, they use gochujang (Korean chili sauce) on their spicy rolls.   I thought the service was poor. Our tuna crash roll was forgotten and we had to ask them for it. It also took a while for them to get us our bill.  Overall, this is a great lunch spot and neighborhood gem. Their sushi is great, and fresh but I'd stick with take out to avoid having to sit through crappy service."}
{"text":"Just ok. They do more quantity than true quality. Sushi is supposed to be bite sized but the rolls were too big to eat on one bite. There is no way that this is the best in the city let alone Vancouver like some reviews state."}
{"text":"This place had consistent reviews and so I thought I'd venture out and try it...I was not disappointed! The salmon and tuna sashimi was very  nice, thick and fresh and the rolls were extremely unique! I had the volcano roll which was incredible and the fried Philadelphia roll which was so cheesy! The spicy salmon roll was also quite nice   Definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"Had better.... Try \"The One\" on Macleod Tr. Better selection and never have not enough Excellent value"}
{"text":"As an easy weeknight restaurant, Sushi Kimu is great. It's convenient, food comes out quick and it's cheap for the amount of food you get. It's a solid mid-range (in quality for Calgary) casual Japanese restaurant but not necessarily a spot for date night.  Small with about 6-7 four seater tables, the decor is simple, modern and clean. Service has always been fantastic and what keeps us coming back is the fact that we can often get away with ordering an entree (pork katsu), one special roll and a salad to share for two and walk away with full bellies. Quality of food wise, I'd stay away from the sashimi. There isn't anything wrong with it, but to me, it just doesn't taste as fresh or as great as some other higher end restaurants. Rolls wise, they have a great selection and I've enjoyed all the ones I've tried. The rice to filling ratio is always good with less rice than actual filling."}
{"text":"Food was well prepared but relies too much on sweet sauces in my opinion. Restaurant was clean and the service was great. I recommend you try it. If you like the flavor theme, you'll love this place."}
{"text":"Pleasently suprised at how clean and cozy it felt when we first stepped in. Must have been the lighting in there, it's spot on, not too dim and not too bright. This is a really small place, seats maybe 20 or so at the most.  We arrived at 6 and my date and I were immediately greeted and seated. Service here is outstanding for what it is, really friendly staff. We placed our order and within 20 minutes, our food was out.  The tonkatsu was amazing, was the best dish we had! Presentation and portion size is really fair for the price you pay.  I really recommend this place. Although it's hard to see how large groups would accommodate since this place is really small, a date or a couple friends would have no seating problems."}
{"text":"Review: lunch.  Bottomline: boutique sushi restaurant that serves good portions and varieties of fantastic sushi and cooked food.  Atmosphere: the restaurant is located in a stripe mall with a small dark sign that is easy to miss. The restaurant is very small, clean and well kept. They only have one large table that can cater to more than 4 people. Service was friendly and attentive.  Food: we were not sure about the food as there were a huge selection to choose from. To our surprise, everything we ordered looked appetizing and tasted great. The fish to rice ratio was on point and the rolls were done well. We ordered the pineapple express and the tropical rolls. It was nice for a change to have  pineapples and bananas as ingredients and they worked well in a sushi roll. The cooked food did not disappoint as well. We ordered the katsu don and the chicken yakisoba. Ingredients were fresh and the flavor profiles were marvelous.  Value: average prices for Japanese food. What striked me strange was the price of a piece of tamago sushi (2 dollars). It was the same price as a piece of salmon sushi which didn't make much sense to me. Otherwise, portions were generous and we left happy on a full stomach.  Encore? Yes."}
{"text":"I was recommend by a co-worker to check this place out. We live fairly close as does a friend of ours and we frequent this area for dinner quite often so we decided to give this spot a try last night.  What a great little spot, and when I say little I mean little, there are maybe 12 tables so its quaint.  You can't judge this place by the outside but once you walk in the door it's very inviting and very well decorated.  They were very quick to greet us and sit us.  The menu is very well put together with stunning pictures which I find very helpful when ordering sushi.  I love that they use re-usable laminated sheets with dry erase markers for their sushi order sheets, shows they are environmentally friendly.  They had two sushi chefs working so once we handed in our order everything came out very quickly. We actually got our sushi before our friend who order the Tomcatsu, which was delicious according to him.  The presentation was spot on, quality was spot on as was the flavor!!  All pluses!!  I have to admit I had quite the craving for sushi as it's been awhile since I've had it and I totally ordered more than we could eat, but that's fine...I have a great lunch to look forward to today!! Overall we were very impressed with this find.  Great atmosphere, great service, great quality and great flavor as well as a great price.  This place we found very reasonable compared to many of the other sushi places.  We will defiantly be making this our local sushi spot."}
{"text":"My new fav sushi place. Totally looks Japanese (but actually Korean people) and taste excellent. Reasonable price and chef is nice enough to accommodate you for special orders if you ask nicely!"}
{"text":"Tried this place tonight via Skip The Dishes since it was one of the higher rated choices according to Yelp. I was impressed by the number of choices for rolls and the prices are very reasonable. The thing is, almost all the rolls consist of the same ingredients and seemed to involve some combination of shrimp, tuna, crab, salmon, mango, avocado and tobiko.    When the rolls arrived, they were neatly and individually packaged.  I have two gripes about my order: first, I ordered a Golden California Roll which claimed to use gold tobiko and have a special sauce.  What I got had no sauce and had the orange tobiko.  Second, I found the slices to be too thick!  I kept thinking I had 2 stuck together, it's a bit much for my mouth.   All in all, it was ok sushi. Not bad, not great. I wish StD would obtain more choices for sushi as most rate 2-3 stars on Yelp."}
{"text":"Summary: - One of the best sushi places in Calgary with moderate selections and fair prices - Amazing food presentations - Decorations: a captivating traditional environment with a modern and classy twist - Service: incredibly polite and fast service - Upon arrival and leaving, nearly the entire staff will call out 'welcome' and 'thank you' like traditional Japanese restaurant do - Small restaurant and often busy; make reservations if possible"}
{"text":"Great small restaurant.  Fantastic food, price quite reasonable considering the quality and the Staff are very nice .I think it's the best Japanese restaurant in the area."}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place that opened not too long ago and wow was I surprised by how delicious everything was. The restaurant is fairly small and has about 10-12 tables and very modern looking compared to the exterior. We sat down immediately and began ordering our feast that could probably feed a family of 4 (there was only 2 of us). I usually tend to over order wherever I go, and just stuff my face until all of the food is gone but this time around my eyes were defiantly bigger than my stomach.  We started off with beef tataki and spicy agadashi tofu. The beef tataki was absolutely amazing, I always order it wherever I go. The beef tataki didn't have the usual daikon like many other places have but substituted it with cucumbers and red onions instead. The cucumber in my opinion adds a little crunch to it and pairs well with acidity of the lemon. The spicy agadashi tofu was another one of my favorites here, the tofu still had the cripsy exterior while being semi-submerged in the broth.   For our main course we ordered the ton katsu, assorted tempura, dragon eye, with a assortment of sushi on top. The ton katsu was one of the most notable dishes we had, the breaded chicken still moist even after being deep fried. The sushi we ordered was delicious and fresh, however, one downside to the sushi was that the rice did not stay together and broke apart when being picked up from the main serving plate.  Overall, this place is a must try and the prices are very reasonable/cheaper when compared to other sushi restaurants in the NW. The quality of the sushi and dishes were superb with excellent service to match. I CAN'T WAIT TO GO BACK =)"}
