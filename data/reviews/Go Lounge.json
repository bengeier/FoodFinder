{"text":"I like this place.  I need to go back on a Friday or Saturday night to see what it's really like, but I went a couple hours before closing on a Wednesday with Nicole H, and it was pretty comfortable with four tables occupied.

I like the interior, it seems like a place I would actually go to just drink coffee or do some work, with the added benefit of having games available if I wanted to play them.

They have a great selection of games in the back, and various events happen every week, including a Scrabble meetup group (Scrabble in the City) every Thursday night.

Beer and other alcohol selection appears ample, but since it was 3 pm on a Wednesday, I opted for tea. Prices for food and drinks are very reasonable, as of yet, there is no game playing fee.

As an extra bonus, service is friendly but also unintrusive.

No on-menu vegan food options or treats (yet), but they do make veg sandwiches with hummus, which is something."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon the new little hidden gem in my hood. Great casual vibe and very warm environment. Recently opened I happened in the weekend they got their liquor license. Early evening it was very casual and family friendly, lots of folks just enjoying the low key vibe & even a few kids playing games. 
I was very early to meet up with friends so just relaxed with a coffee & a sandwich. The panini sandwich was surprisingly  good, didn't have much expectations as food was quite cheap, but was pleasantly surprised. Staff were calm & friendly, no rushing me along as I was waiting for friends. After about an hour my friends arrived and we sorted through the wall of games....tons of options. We sat for hours, talking, playing several games, drinking, and snacking. Drinks were cheap & the bananna/nutella paninis were to die for. Great ambience but calm enough that we could comfortably talk.
Great atmosphere, no attitude, great food & drinks ...... Gonna be my new favourite local gem!"}
{"text":"Go Lounge replaced the former Big Guys Cafe that was at this address for about two years. The draw to the old place was its inexpensive Americano coffee. 

The new business was in the works getting its permits approved before Ward 14 councillor Gord Perks placed  a moratorium on new food and drinking establishments in October 2012. It opened on November 20, 2012 and is the last new establishment of its kind in Parkdale until at least the fall of 2013.

Went here on Sunday night, and the place was full on this chilly and snowy evening in February. My guest and I played a board game from seven o'clock to closing. 

The place was loud with one large group playing some kind of charade or guess the word game. It was kind of humorously distracting from the strategy game we were playing.

The lounge has a full bar, though no draught beer: they apparently will be getting their lines within the month. We had the bottled beer, which had some less mainstream craft-beer choices available including Junction Brewery's Conductor's Craft Ale in 500ml dark brown bottles, as well as Lug Tread Ale from Beau's All Natural Brewery. Unibroue's Fin de Monde is also available, but only in 341 ml bottles (it's 9% alcohol).

The food was very mediocre, and my e pi√±ata was cold. The dipping sauce was good though. Since they don't have a full-size kitchen, just like the previous establishment, food is a secondary or even lower thought at this place: you go here to play board games and drink either coffee or some kind of alcohol.

Overall the atmosphere hasn't changed much since this was The Big Guys Cafe, but the fact that it also serves alcohol and has board games means there is more to do here now. 

I'll certainly be back again, but likely when they get their beer taps installed. Also, there doesn't appear to be set times when they are open, but the only thing I could get for certain from one of the staff persons was that Mondays are always closed. If going n a Thursday, Friday or Saturday evening, I would make reservations, as tables are limited."}
{"text":"If you're a casual gamer going for drinks and food for an hour or so, this may be the place. But this is no snakes n lattes. And I'm aware that they don't claim to be... But here are the stark differences:

1. The obvious one: less of a choice in board games.

2. The servers constantly hover around your table asking for an order. And you should order seeing that they don't charge cover. But here's the annoying bit - as soon as you deplete whatever you ordered, they come back.

3. You can't hang around for as long as you want (as you can at snakes or lattes). They'll find a way to kick you out. Lol.

Now, I understand their business model and they do what they need to do to make money but I felt like I'd overstayed my welcome my first (and possibly last) time here. Here's what happened: after we ordered and finished quite a bit: two teas, a coke, sandwich and chips, the server came around asking us if we'd like to order more. When we said we're okay, she informed us briskly that there was a reservation coming in in 10 minutes and we'd have to leave. Of course, a prior notice, even half hour would've been helpful because then we wouldn't be rushing to leave halfway through our game. I guess she (the server) realized that we were slightly puzzled at her behavior after she walked away.. So she came back to explain that they usually have reservations on Saturday evenings. So I don't know, maybe she redeemed herself there. I didn't have the best experience because I have low tolerance for unwelcoming places."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend on a Sunday night, excited to partake in their Trivia Night as advertised on their website. My friend had called earlier in the day to confirm the event. Upon arrival, the waiter asked us whether we were there for Trivia Night, we agreed, and we were told that we could take a seat anywhere. We arrived early to have dinner so we each ordered a panini at $9 a piece. The sandwiches were disappointing and we can only assume that they were heated in a toaster oven at best. Service was minimal as our server was on his IPad throughout the night so we played a board game to pass the time. We ordered a coffee at 8pm, the time that trivia was supposed to begin. 8:40 passes and we ask the waiter whether or not Trivia Night will be happening to which he informs us that it is cancelled due to low attendance. Had he not known that we were there for that particular event, we would not have been so displeased with our experience. All in all, we spent money on driving from the east end, parking downtown, and shitty sandwiches just for an upsetting time."}
