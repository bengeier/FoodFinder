{"text":"Ok sushi if you don't feel like making a trip downtown, the rolls are rolled sloppy and always fall apart, overall feels like eating at a mall sushi restaurant, nothing special."}
{"text":"Slow service and mediocre food. 
We heard good things about this place, and we love Haru so we thought we would give it a shot. The service was so slow, they were obviously overwhelmed or understaffed. Tables didn't get cleared, took forever to place our order, took at least 10 min for them to just bring water, and we never got a refill on the water despite it being empty. 
We had the prawn sunamono, spicy shrimp roll, beef udon, salmon and unagi nigiri.
The sunamono was warm and the noodles were mushy. The salmon was tough, the unagi was ok, but tasted a little fishy. The spicy shrimp roll was pretty good. The beef udon was pretty bland. 
We really had high hopes for this place but it was a disappointment. I would recommend going to Haru!! Haru is awesome!"}
{"text":"My first time trying this restaurant. I walked in to order takeout for 3 people. I ordered two specialty rolls a combo platter consisting of dynamite Roll spicy tuna roll and California roll along with an additional dynamite roll and an order of Tobiko. I wanted to upgrade my combo platter with the more expensive crispy tuna roll and was told that I would be charged the difference between the two rolls which I expected but also an additional $1 penalty for altering how it appears on the menu. All that was done to the original spicy tuna roll was some crunchy onions sprinkled on top. This one small insult was enough to taint the whole experience. The food was very tasty once we got home however if the attempt wasn't made to squeeze every last dollar from a first-time client I would have actually left a tip which I don't usually do for a pickup. I will never be back as there are a lot of other great sushi places in the area. I hope that extra $1 keeps your doors open for just a little bit longer because it was the last dollar you will ever get from me and my family."}
{"text":"Good quality sushi sashimi tempura. Was $100 for three people with drinks and we were full, definitely going back. The seats of the bench seat was sagging a bit and too low so was kind of uncomfortable"}
{"text":"I love that I'm just a 5 min walk away from this place, I hate that I only think to come here on Mondays when they're not open (I always seem to forget!)

When I can catch a break and it's not Monday, I get to satisfy my sushi cravings. I've been here for lunch and dinner, and the service and food are equally good during both. Parking can sometimes be a nightmare (it's in a strip mall next to a busy pub) which is why I luck out and can just walk over, and the restaurant is quite large and kept really clean (including the washrooms).

I recommend the tempura udon (over the chicken - which is just grilled chicken, not teriyaki like most places) and the spicy salmon roll. 

Although a bit pricey (what do you expect for a restaurant situated right in the 'burbs?), you get fresh quality food."}
{"text":"VERY VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE QUALITY OF THE SERVICE.

I had called multiple times to place a take out order at 8:00 PM.  The first time she asked to put me on hold cos they got quite busy and I had said ok, only to find out minutes later that they had hung up on me. Which is fine...accidents do happen.  I have worked at restaurants and I understand that things can get a little overwhelming. 

I called back 3-4 times and was directed to an answering machine. On the 5th time, I got an answer and was asked to put on hold again....to be HUNG UP on  once more.  I called back once again multiple times to receive the automated voicemail.  When someone finally answered the call, I asked her why I was hung up on twice while on hold?  She yelled in the phone that no one hung up on me (when my phone clearly stated DISCONNECTED).  

Like I said, I understand that things can get quite overwhelming, but I am utterly disappointed with how they handle the situation.  

The first time I dined in the restaurant, service was slow as is;  I was willing to give them another try.  

To me, I think service is a really important aspect in this industry and unfortunately, if they don't pick up the pace, they will lose out on MANY MANY MANY more customers. I can not express how disappointed I am.  

Thumbs down."}
{"text":"Good Japanese food with average pricing. The restaurant itself has a more contemporary interior. I ask myself every time I go to a new Japanese restaurant, why don't/aren't there any Japanese working in these places.  I guess the average person wouldn't notice these things.  I on the other hand do notice. 
As far as the food goes, everything from the appetizers to the main entrees are all pretty good."}
{"text":"The sushi is ok, but nothing special.  There are other comparable restaurants in the area now, Taiyo is one example.  Service is a bit slow but comparable to non-asian restaurants.  I think they really need one more server.  People were left standing at the door for way too long before they are acknowledged.  There was a large group of people that came in and they just couldn't accommodate them in one table, so I do not recommend this place if you have more than 6-7 people.  It is a small restaurant, and it is no guarantee that you will be seated together.  

As for the food, we had the tuna roll (see picture).  Although the presentation was great, the tuna in the roll just did not taste fresh.  I was not impressed with it.  I know sushi restaurants probably don't put the freshest fish inside rolls but at least it should still taste decent.  Their regular salmon sushi tasted good though."}
{"text":"Order from here a lot, always get takeout. Food is ready quickly and is very tasty! I've only had rolls and maki here. Haven't tried their sashimi or noodle dishes."}
{"text":"I love their poke bowls here! Definitely happy I can get really fresh and delicious poke bowls in the south! I usually create my own and there's so many toppings to choose from. I've literally ate their poke bowls for a week straight. Customer service is awesome too."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favourite sushi spot. Beautiful restaurant, genuine service, and you can taste the careful preparation of the food. Must try the sushi pizza!"}
{"text":"Delicious tempura. But probably the best California rolls I've ever had. Decent prices & portions. Loved that it was only a 5 minute walk from my place! I recommend it"}
{"text":"First off, clean place and friendly service. The sushi bar is in full view of the main dining area and the host/manager had a friendly smile
throughout the night I noticed. Ordered Tempura Udon along with two
types of Aburio Rolls seen above. The rolls themselves were presented very nicely so kudos to that. The taste itself wasn't bad either, nothing to write home about but definitely nothing bad to
say about it. The fish was good, slightly above average, but I did notice that the rolls had more rice proportionally than other places (ie Globefish/Towa) and the rice itself seemed to be Chinese
style rice (as opposed to Japanese style rice). The udon and tempura, like all other things that nite had good appearances but
fell short of being considered \"excellent\". For the Udon, the noodles were good and the broth was nice but the proportion of
noodles was definitely much less than I usually expected while the prices were your standard $9-11 depending what you choose to order as a side with your udon. Overall, nothing really exciting, there
just aren't that many choices in the Panorama area so competition may be lacking a bit in that area. It is a nice choice to have in that area for those that live there though and the price is about
average I would say. Variety is standard and taste standard for Calgary. Would I go back? Yeah. But I wouldn't go out of my way to go there unless I was in the area."}
{"text":"The food is consistently good most of the time. However, the service can be hit or miss and a bit robotic with no emotion or personality...and the hours really suck.  Closing and Opening at different times during the day and weekends makes it annoying and hard to visit when half the time it seems to be closed."}
{"text":"Ive been coming to ajisai for over 4 years. Always amazing service and food. But yet in the last year ive noticed a very noticeable difference in quality. The rolls are sloppy and fall apart, the rice is not good anymore, lots of the food has become bland and they have taken a few of their best dishes off the menu. Used to be a great place, but now you can definitely find better sushi in the city, especially for their prices."}
{"text":"Great place to eat. Friendly staff, amazing food. Good portions & healthy choices. I usually take out and it's always ready on time. But dine in is also a very enjoyable experience. Highly recommend it"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here a few times.  
We had our date night last Friday night here, it was pretty quiet but the service was quick and the food was great.  The wait was not too long either.  Our waitress was very good at keeping my green tea topped up and hot.  
We had some tempura and an assortment of sushi and rolls.   
Everything was very well made and neat in appearance.  
I recommend this lovely little sushi place to all of my sushi loving friends."}
{"text":"Great sushi this far out in the suburbs is nearly impossible to find though Ajisai comes close. Service is excellent, good variety of cooked and raw Japanese food, clear menus. I wish the portions were a but more generous. 

And lastly, the tea is great."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a whole new look/menu/ownership.

They have amazing poke bowls for take out. I highly recommend to give it a whirl! We have eaten these all around the world and these are extremely fresh tasting.

Try the traditional bowl. It's our favourite. Staff is very nice and will usually have it ready for you in 10 minutes."}
