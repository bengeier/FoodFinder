{"text":"Great place to grab lunch.  Sandwiches are tasty, homemade chips are a perfectly complimenting side. Staff was very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Love this spot!! First off, the place is beautiful, absolutely love the dapper details, and it's so inviting. Secondly, the food is AMAZING. Portions are large and perfect for sharing (my daughter and I shared a half sandwich with side salad and it was more than enough). The fam and I have visited twice and tried the Achin' for Bacon and the Stallion sandwiches, as well as the Emerald Skirt salad- all of it was primo! For sides, the potato salad is really bacon-y (which we enjoyed) and the homemade chips are bomb!! On both visits the service was outstanding, staff is friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. We will definitely keep coming back!"}
{"text":"I went there for the first time last night and will be back many times to come.  Not only is the location right next to my office, it is really easy to get to off N Scottsdale Drive with plenty of parking to spare.  Granted I went in the evening so the business crowd wasn't there.  The place is immaculate as it probably should be having only been open 8 weeks, but beyond that just a well organized and neatly designed space.  The staff were courteous and actually the main guy there, forgot to get his name, went out of his way to fix the drink dispenser immediately when I told him it wasn't working right.  I ordered the Hot Mess and some Kale chips with a drink.  I am not a vegetarian but I would say the \"Hot Mess\" is a vegetarians dream.  \"charred shiittake mushroom, cheddar, jack, swiss, sun-dried tomato, tempura onion, wild arugula, chipotle mayo\"   HEAVEN!  I love the fact that they have Kale Chips as a side, so it turned into a veggie dinner real quick, but the quality and the freshness and the flavors were all on point.  Top notch, this is no Subway, so don't expect subway prices, a foot long here goes around 12.99.  If you want real quality ingredients this is the place though.  The soda dispenser has lots of interesting choices, not your average fair...The cream soda is AMAZING. All that said, I cannot wait for another expereince and probably eat there.  They have some pick up system at the front door I didn't try to figure out so there might be something in that for people on the go that might be cool.  Just hit this place up, you won't be let down."}
{"text":"Great environment, excellent food and great service! Highly recommend. The salads are amazing and the sandwiches are soooooo good."}
{"text":"This place is great. Food was good. Service was great. This was my second trip as ND we all loved it. I would recommend this to anyone. Just remember the sandwiches are very big I suggest a half sandwich. The dapper Dipper is really good. Enjoy"}
{"text":"Sooo good!  I ordered the chicken sandwich (super Mario) and it was fantastic.  I can't wait to have it again.  The staff was so nice and friendly and the price is just right for what you get!"}
{"text":"Huge sandwiches layers with Quality shaved cold cuts.  Steak salad was awesome.  Kids meals are all around appealing."}
{"text":"The Dutch Crunch bread really is not that good. If your comparing the bread here to the bread at IKE's, then it really is no contest. The second time at a new place always seems to lose it's shine. This is a place you should go for the extravagent sandwich, not the lowly turkey with basic fixings. My choice was the Rubicon special which was basically turkey and a slice of cheese with roasted red peppers. It also seemed smaller on that type of bread, but only costs about eight bucks, so that is a normal price. Go big or go somewhere else."}
{"text":"New favorite lunch spot! And probably some dinners too. Love that they have delicious vegetarian options on the menu in addition to their yummy sandwiches. Super fresh and So SO SO good!"}
{"text":"UPDATE: June 18, 2018  This experience really renders 2.5 stars. I went with the Super Mario on pesto bread. My fiancé decided to get the Stallion on garlic cheese bread. We also got an order of 6 mini cookies and the bacon potato salad.   I was so excited to see 2 cookies pop out of my sandwich wrapping. Unfortunately, those cookies were really dry... dare I say pretty stale too?   My sandwich - oh boy. There was so much balsamic vinegar! It wasn't very appealing and the bottom layer of bread holding my sandwich couldn't do its job. It was just a wet mess so that made it a pretty disappointing sandwich. The balsamic was just dripping everywhere.   My fiancé's sandwich - Like I said earlier, he had the Stallion on garlic cheese bread. He said it was the bleu cheese bread even though we ordered the garlic cheese. Bummer... I'm definitely not a fan of bleu cheese so I did not want to verify it.   If I knew the cookies were going to be this dry/stale, I wouldn't have wasted my money on them. The last time we got them, they were soft and chewy! Ugh.   The bacon potato salad. Another let down. We both tossed it because it was so bland and not worth the calories.   I REALLY want to like this place. Maybe third times the charm? I'll just have to convince my fiancé."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! BEST Deli EVER! FRESHEST Ingredients EVER! I order this place 3 to 4 times a week thru a delivery service and the food is ALWAYS exactly as ordered, unbelievably fast, and beyond tasty! I want to scream it from the rooftops, how darn awesome this place is! They have a great way of mixing ingredients together to create flavor bombs! Thank You Rubicon for the most delicious, freshest lunch delivery EVER! I LOVE YOU!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I had the superfood salad and nutty açaí bowl, while my fiancé had the rich boy sandwich with jalapeño jack bread! Fantastic! Everything was phenomenal I highly recommend! Seating outside along with inside seating. Staff was beyond friendly."}
{"text":"I'll give it 3 stars since my husband said his sandwich was okay. This is not a deli, but a sandwich shop.  Meat is pre sliced, portion controlled. No rare roast beef, no chicken salad. Lots of choices for bread, but nothing special,"}
{"text":"Went for lunch today. The food was excellent. A half sandwich is huge and very tasty. The cookie was so so but the sandwich made up for it. As far as drink selections they do not carry name brand sodas but what they do have was very good. No artificial sweeteners or corn syrup. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The roast beef was better then any deli I have had in town. The bread was soft fresh and so yummy. I highly recommend this place for lunch."}
{"text":"Only thing holding back from 5 stars is that I ordered the Emerald Skirt salad (which is delicious!) and didn't receive a knife in my take out bag.  This salad definitely needs a knife because the skirt steak isn't completely cut through.  I had to use my fingers."}
{"text":"Can't wait to go back! This was my first visit to any rubicon deli and I was impressed. From beginning to end the staff made the experience enjoyable. My husband and I split the large spicy tuna sandwich. I wasn't expecting much because how good can a tuna sandwich taste? Well I was surprisingly mistake, it was one of the best tuna sandwiches I have ever had. From the blue cheese bread to the sandwich toppings everything was fresh and delicious. Each sandwich comes with chips and a cookie since we ordered one sandwich we got one of each. However, when we asked for a second plate, they gave us another bag of chips and cookie! Little things like that go a long way."}
{"text":"My husband and I really enjoyed this place... the food was extremely fresh . My husband got the skirt steak salad and  I got the rubicon special (half sandwich) .. both were delicious . Half sandwich portion was more then enough for lunch and/or dinner.. the employees were extremely friendly and helpful . Would definitely recommend and return."}
{"text":"This was a pleasant surprise. I ordered the \"rich boy\" with the kale chips and lemon berry soda. So good. Full of flavor and fresh! The decor is hella cute, super simple and clean. They have a huge window in the kitchen and you can see everything. Service is amazing!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! They have both hot and cold sandwiches and they are huge! The half was more than enough to eat, I couldn't finish it all. They have a variety of breads and toppings, I chose to build my own because I like a very simple sandwich but their bread was amazing. Also their staff was very friendly and helpful. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We're absolutely addicted to this place! The Rich Boy sandwich is a game changer. The portions and prices are amazing. Everything I have tried has been so so good. Plus they have the option for any sandwich to come in a lettuce cup, which is basically a head of romaine! They're fast and very accommodating. The staff is always friendly and helpful, whether I'm on the phone placing an order or in store picking up. So happy they're here in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"I used to go to this deli when it first started in Lake Tahoe. I was excited to see one open up in Scottsdale and it didn't disappoint. I ordered the rubicon special on pesto bread and it was just as good as I remember. The process for online ordering makes it really easy to grab for lunch and the sandwiches are HUGE!"}
{"text":"The best sandwich I've ever had! Truly. My husband and I are obsessed with Rubicon. I love the Achin for Bacon sandwich on pesto bread. My husband loves the Rubi Club with jalapeño jack bread. Their chips are TO DIE FOR! They're crinkle cut and the seasoning is so, so good! Slightly sweet. And your sandwich comes with a delightful little chocolate chip cookie! If you're a big tea drinker like me, their tropical black tea is bomb. I'm sure others have mentioned, but the sandwiches are huge. So a half sandwich is basically a whole sandwich. You could definitely split. As for sides, we've also had the side salad with honey dijon vinaigrette and the cilantro jalapeño ranch - both dressings are very good. The pesto bow tie pasta side is yummy. The tomato soup I've also tried. It was good, but not your typical tomato soup. It may have a hint of curry or something in it? We've also tried a couple of the salads - the buffalo chicken one and the one that has the kale chips, both of which were good. I guess my point is, everything here is good and you should go immediately. Oh, and the service is great! Everyone is so friendly and helpful. Okay, I'm done!"}
{"text":"First time here and sooooo delicious. Staff was fantastic. Was here at 1145 am on Sunday and nice girl who ran us up was super kind. Sandwhich (The Stallion) is delicious!"}
{"text":"There's a new sandwich in town pardner and it's putting the other guys on notice.  Rubicon Deli distinguishes itself in a few key areas.  First, it gives bread the respect it deserves through its freshness and variety.  Second, their focus on quality and creativity.  The flavors blend well and it only takes one bite to know that they are sourcing the quality ingredients.  Finally, their commitment to quality execution. It is evident in the little things like their complimentary chips and cookies.  All in all I'd say that the bar has been lifted again...and my stomach thanks you."}
{"text":"Amazing service and super amazing food. Staff is very friendly and accommodating. I had a great first  experience. I would come here again"}
{"text":"Great deli!  Order at the counter and they deliver.  The Dapper Dipper (French dip) was great and ordering the full sandwich, only recommended if you are REALLY hungry.....huge!"}
{"text":"We had Rubicon Deli cater for a meeting at work today. They did an unbelievable job. Everyone in the meeting was thrilled! The food was delivered right on time and delicious as always. Thank you Rubicon"}
{"text":"I came for the famous Dipper Dapper the first time but quite honestly, if you don't like Horseradish, don't get it. The kale chips aren't good either but we came back again and their Rich Boy (grilled chipotle chicken with avocado) was fantastic and perfectly toasted. Their chips were good too and for the price for the smaller size, it was enough for two of us."}
{"text":"This isn't the usual sandwich shop. This is now my favorite. Friendly staff, who check in regularly to see if you need anything. They bake their own bread daily, whole wheat and Dutch crunch are excellent. Their whole sandwiches are huge as they are very generous with the meat and toppings. You can also order just a half, but why would you? The other half makes for a great lunch the next day. We have been here about 6 times and we haven't had a sandwich we didn't like.  Our favorites are the dapper dipper(prime roasted beef), the ma'am (beef brisket), and the Rubicon special(roasted turkey). Try it, your gonna love it!"}
{"text":"Third time here. I have had the emerald skirt which is amazing!! Today I am trying the cowboy salad and it is delicious as well!!! It has a little kick to it and the chicken is so flavorful and delicious. Some of the best salad ive ever had! The staff is really friendly and great as well!"}
{"text":"Love that this is available on door dash! Makes my lunch breaks a little easier.   Good, hefty size sandwiches and got my order correct even with modifications.   My sandwich was a little too greasy so I think I will try a salad next time! But yes, the bread is AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Trust me you wont find a better sandwich anywhere in the Valley. The highlight is the Dapper Dipper which puts other french dip sandwiches to shame."}
{"text":"Stoped in the establishment last night after 7:00pm. Two sandwiches ordered the Dapper dipper and the Mario, let's start out by saying the bread is absolutely awesome! My Mario was very good. My honey felt the dipper was just ok. I think he is used to a sandwich that has a tremendous amount of meat, this sammy he felt the bread was the star. I also ordered pickle and bacon potato salad very good! Just like everybody else here on yelp  if you love peanut butter cookies this one is stuffed with jelly it is absolutely amazing!"}
{"text":"This place is really good!  You can see right into the kitchen from a large window.  Their bread is fresh and the combinations seem really great.  I had the dapper dipper.  One thing I would say is that the sauce that comes on this is labeled as a jalapeño sauce but tastes more of horseradish (hate horseradish).  Once I scrapped a majority of that off, I thoroughly enjoyed myself.  I'll be back to try some other sandwiches since they all sounded so amazing.  Also have to mention the employees were extremely nice, always checking if you needed anything else and made sure you were enjoying your food.  Well done!"}
{"text":"The food was presented nicely. Jocelyn and the entire staff was very friendly. I liked sitting behind the glass watching the food being prepared.  My buffalo chicken in the salad was cooked to perfection! The jalapeno bread and homemade fries was very good also."}
{"text":"Was excited to see this place open in Scottsdale after visiting one of their locations in San Diego a few years ago!  Had their roast beef sandwich which was really good.  Staff was friendly and the deli was clean.  The half sandwich is plenty for one serving.  Will probably upgrade my side dish next time as the house chips weren't that great."}
{"text":"When they ask half or hole for your sandwich get a half! Unless there are two of you! Great sandwiches even better service. Would defiantly come here again!"}
{"text":"Since we used to live in Tahoe where this small family-run chain started, we were really surprised to find them in Scottsdale! Their sandwiches are amazing (pro tip: get the pesto bread, people), but I had a salad that would make Mother Nature proud. It was fresh and yummy and had all kinds of goodness and flavor. My hubby had a sammie and was really happy with it.  Go, eat, enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  The sandwiches are outstanding and the different breads made it hard to choose from, but wow, what a winning place this is.  For lunch if you go right at lunch time, you may not get a seat, it packs up quickly.  It also funnels out quickly too, but I recommend either going right as they open or a little later past the lunch time to avoid the heavy crowds."}
{"text":"Okay let's start off with this, if you rate the food here low you clearly are a subway lover and don't deserve to be on yelp. The food is great I love this place. Yeah it's a little on the pricey side, but you get a massive sandwich with fresh ingredients. They messed up my order the last time I went in,  not only did they remake my food right away correctly they insisted I take the sandwich they messed up on. It was still good even without the lettuce. I always have leftovers here. Which means that pricey sandwich just became lunch the next day. The sandwich was still good"}
{"text":"Rubicons Deli  Dapper Dipper on Dutch Crunch Bread. Ordered the large size sandwich and both of us could eat only 3/4 of the sandwich, it looks like it is an entire loaf of bread by itself. Have to say this is one of the better sandwiches around, with the Dutch Crunch bread and roast beef is a very good combination to dip in the au Jous. The amount of horse radish is good, not over bearing but you know it is there. Please look at the attached photo to see how large the big size sandwich is.  Bacon Potato Salad is just average at best, expected more of a bacon flavor with the salad  Chocolate Chip Cookie was also small and average.  Was told that Rubicon Deli is from the San Diego area and is a nice addition to North Scottsdale.  Overall, enjoyed the sandwich, would put their sandwich just behind Ike's Sandwich shop and the French Dip Sandwich a distance behind Houstons / Hillstones French Dip"}
