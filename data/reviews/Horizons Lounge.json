{"text":"Had no idea what I was walking into when I arrived at this place alone on a weekday. But as I walked in I was welcomed with great hospitality. The staff was very friendly and let me sit anywhere, and choose whatever mix in shisha that I'd like. The flavours I got were pomegranate orange mint and watermelon kiwi mint and they were great. For the price it's a lot cheaper than any there hookah place on Lawrence or in the vicinity. All in all, it was good music, good board and video games, and very kind staff! 

ps. I'll be back again."}

{"text":"Good music, good prices, and amazing customer service! The staff is super friendly and very accommodating. They make the tea right in front you so it's guaranteed to be fresh, and overall it's just a very cozy and comfortable environment. They provide cards upon request and also carry a good range of board games and they often come and check up on you without being annoying. The place is awesome in all aspects but as the description says, bring good company and you will have the best time. This place is easily my new favourite sheesha spot!"}
