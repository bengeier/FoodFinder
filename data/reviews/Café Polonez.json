{"text":"If you are going for Polish food you are going to Polonez. An experience. Reasonably priced and I guarantee you will be well fed with tasty comfort food. Don't leave without trying the fruit compote."}
{"text":"Outstanding!!!!!!!!! The group of 17 traveling from Philadelphia to toronto visited this great place. Most of us born in US but of Polish decent, wanted to try this Polish restaurant.  I, an experience restaurant manager , know what a great management can do to be on the top.  We visited on saturday at 3 Pm. The place was packed solid. The service made it so easy to sit us at two tables and suggested that we would not even think about being separated once the first dish hits the table. Indeeeeedddddd. The soups were fantastic. The liver dish and schnitzel was one of the best I ever had. The presentation and taste.  I ended up trying 6 different plates because all of us were telling others \" you have to try this and that, its great, \" I felt bed we had no room for desert, because the size of each plate was huge.  At the end came our bill and we were shocked to pay ONLY 294 for 17 of us.  THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH."}
{"text":"Loved their vegetarian options (cabbage rolls, sauerkraut and mushroom perogi) and large-format Polish beers. Great spot for a hearty meal and excellent service."}
{"text":"LOVE this place. Great prices for the amount of tasty food you receive.  It is always busy and a little loud and if you want to have an intimate dining experience, this may not be the place. But service is good, food is excellent, I love the beat soup with mushroom dumplings and love the Hungarian pancake dish. The salads that come with the dish are tasty, tasty, tasty! The pierogis... yum."}
{"text":"If you want to have a meal that is authentically \"Roncesvalles\" then this is the place. It has been here for decades and it provides hearty food at a reasonable price. Whenever we have family in from out of town, we go here; nobody leaves hungry, and everyone is eager to return the next time they are back. The street now has plenty of trendoid restaurants with cutesy names and ironic food, but Polonez is the real deal."}
{"text":"This is a staple for me and I always keep coming back! (and Im Polish) Pierogies are amazing and handmade, borscht, schnitzels, kotlety, cabbage rolls, everything always tastes delicious and fresh!  Service is lovely too."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, mostly without my Polish fiancee. I'm happy to see an all-Polish staff, which just adds to the traditional authenticity the place carries - something I'd hoped for in a neighbourhood known as \"Little Poland\".  Everything from the food to the drinks to the service can be qualified as quite authentic. I would consider Polish fair to be comfort food, and this place has an expansive and mouth-watering selection.  Expect large portions, all made well and authentically. Service is attentive and efficient. The clientele is multi-cultural, and consists of everything from young patrons on their own to three generations of family dining together to couples on a romantic date night.  Look forward to: daily specials, excellent homemade soups, hearty, unpretentious meals, a good selection of several Polish beers all served in their respective steins (Poland produces amazing beers! A great value here in Ontario.), a good selection of several Polish vodkas (of course), and a decent wine list.  This place is definitely worth trying out, even if sauerkraut and cabbage rolls aren't your thing!"}
{"text":"Great polish restaurant! Authentic, classic dishes. Make a reservation, this place gets busy early.  Came here with my family for a Sunday dinner.   Good overall experience.  Service was a little slow.    Everyone I was with enjoyed their meals.   I ordered the Combo platter one including 4 pierogi, Hunter's Stew, Polonez Schnitzel and a salad.   Everything tasted delicious and authentic. Hunter's stew was a delicious take on kapusta.   Other dishes ordered includes ribs, pierogi's, schnitzel and all were enjoyed.  Good wine and beer selection.  You can choose from 6-7 Polish beers.  Atmostphere was relaxing, old school feel (lots of old folks enjoying the flavours of their youth).    Overall, great family dinner spot. Fair prices, tasty food!"}
{"text":"Very friendly service. They served us some bread and butter soon as we were seated. Perogies were so good. Bean soup was delicious. Cant wait to come back and try some other food in the menu."}
{"text":"Delicious cabbage rolls, chicken balls, and potato pancakes! Proper East European home cooking and great service! I plan to return so I can sample the borscht, compote, and perogies!"}
{"text":"I am disappointed with the experience I had at Polonez Cafe. We walked in it was very busy, the staff asked that we wait in the 4x4 corridor which was fine. Then another staff member approached and said to wait in the corridor and shut the door because its cold. There was four people in my party and six people already in the corridor and she wanted me to squeeze in and shut the door, it was physically impossible for all of us to fit. Furthermore she proceeded to make a scene and give attitude to me and my mom.   Never coming back!!! Their loss not mine!"}
{"text":"Great place for Polish food.. I recommend ordering borsch (with meat dumplings) as well as one of the schnitzels that they offer. Other items on the menu are good also, but I recommend starting with those two.  If you live in the area then definitely give this a shot."}
{"text":"Cafe Polonez is like the next generation of Polish restaurants on Roncesvalles. The food is about the same, but instead of the charmingly scuzzy diner/pub surroundings, it has a clean, stylish look. (Think Sunset Grill with Kolbasa and cabbage.)  One of the highlights is definitely the White Borscht, which has chunks of sausage and hard-boiled eggs floating around in the delicious and thick broth. Other dishes can be hit-and-miss.  Be warned: there's a lot of choral Polish singing pumped through the restaurant, which can be charming or annoying, depending on your preferences."}
{"text":"Maureen P. beat me to it.  She reviewed Cafe Polonez before I did.  She wonders why I didn't tell her about.  To be frank, I was considering keeping it secret.  Because I knew once I told her, everyone would know and the place would get way busier making it harder for me to get a table.    Its selfish, I know.  But I can't help it.  Second best homemade pierogies I've ever had (mine are the best haha j/k).  The fruit perogies are good, almost dessert-like.  The savory pierogies are the best smeared with sour cream and the bacon/onion/butter mixture they give you.    My favorite entree by far is the pork goulash in a potato pancake.  Portions are massive (for me at least) - I only eat 1/2 my food and bring the rest home for lunch.  The pancake is perfectly crisp and soaks up the gravy in the best way.  They serve it with 3 salads - coleslaw, carrots and beets.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it.  This isn't fancy food.  This is the stuff your Polish grandma would make you.  This is evident when you look around at the other patrons.  Average age is 50+.  But if you happen to see an Asian girl carefully portioning out sour cream to each pierogi, stop by and say hi."}
{"text":"We yelped this location and after our visit we gladly give it 5 stars. We stopped by after visiting the High Park and were seated immediately. The interior was clean with a nice decor.  Menu items were well described and the food was well worth the fare. Service was great and the food was tasty. If you are looking for a Polish cousine, this place hits the spot!  P.S. Not familiar with the Toronto area, we parked about two blocks away on a side street. Plan accordingly."}
{"text":"It has great Polish food and lovely waitresses. However, don't judge our culture entirely off of them."}
{"text":"The restaurant offers traditional Polish dishes. I am just not a big fan of Polish cuisine -although being Polish myself! But if you are looking for an authentic Polish fix, something that will you make remember the food you had back home or that your grandma used to cook, well, this is the place."}
{"text":"My girlfriends Polish so she makes me eat here. I can't tell if this place is good or not because it's Polish and Polish food tastes bland.  The prices are very reasonable for what you get lots of good food"}
{"text":"Delicious, high quality home cooking with friendly service!  We had the borscht with meat dumplings, which was very beet-y and the dumplings were clearly hand made.  We also had potato pancake stuffed with goulash, cabbage roll, perogies, schnitzel, and all the fixings...all of it was clearly made by hand.  So yummy, and very filling - we had to pack up half of it to bring it home.  Restaurant is simple, clean and modern-ish.  This will definitely become a regular place for our family."}
{"text":"awesome food, excellent service.  if you enjoy eastern european food, you'll love this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Great service the waiters are friendly just sometimes the food takes a while to come. Personally I love to get either the Hungarian style pancakes or the cabbage rolls but I also recommend the dill pickle soup and the borszcz. Ah heck it's all good :p. The portions are very large so bring your appetite."}
{"text":"Came here based on the rave reviews but I wasn't so impressed.   1) Service is really lackluster.  We were seated at a table that hadn't been cleaned.  When the waitress noticed this she wiped it down but there will still crumbs and whatnot from the last guests left on our table so we had to clean it again ourselves after she left.  It took about 30 minutes after we ordered to get our food.  We waited so long trying to flag down a waitress to bring us some water we ended up just going up to the cash to ask for it.  The place was about 3/4 full (it was 4pm on a Sunday) so they were busy but not overwhelmed. The waitress never checked on us to see if we needed anything or if our meal was ok, we just had to try to flag her down repeatedly whenever we needed something.  2) The food is decent but nothing to write home about and I think for what it is overpriced.   We ordered the Platter for Two which is $40 and you get 2 cabbage rolls, 2 schnitzel, 6 perogies, and cole slaw and a beet salad.   The platter is quite big so there's plenty of food, but as another reviewer commented  we found the food a bit bland.   If you don't need to dine in I'd recommend Zakopane Deli on Lakeshore as it's cheaper and much more flavourful.   So the plus side: Big portions Down side: Service is lacking, overpriced, and bland food."}
{"text":"Came to this restaurant whilst visiting Toronto and the food was excellent. We got the paprikash in the potato pancake to share. Service was great and friendly and a great place to go to after visiting the park."}
{"text":"Delicious food, great relaxing atmosphere, and good service. I love the cabbage rolls, and the bigos was a hit with our table as well. I love that they have full meals, or you can mix and match various a la carte Polish dishes and you can customize your meal however you want."}
{"text":"Updated review- Cafe Polonze as featured on a food network show and for the last little while it has attracted a lot of people.  There are line ups on Saturday nights.  This is great for the owners s many more people now know how great the food is here.  However not so good for patrons.  The food is always great and the service is really good.  I'm a regular and will continue to go there for the excellent polish food."}
{"text":"This place offers great value!  The potato pancake was great!  Pirogies were amazing!  Skip on the bread basket to make room for dinner.  The only thing I didn't love was the schnitzel. So i'd skip on that. But it's a great place for an introduction to polish/Ukrainian/Russian food."}
{"text":"I just ate at Cafe Polonez and the food reminded me so much of my grandmothers food. Everything was fresh and home made. I got the sampler platter of cabbage rolls, peirogies and cutlets. Everything was delicious. The price was also good and the service was ok."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. Just this year I visited here for my birthday and Valentine's day (among less special occasion visits)  . I suggest going for dinner with a friend or two and getting the platter for 2. Or even just the special of the day.  The food is always fresh, delicious, hot, and the service is friendly and quick. It's even worth a trip to Roncesvalles if you live across town, like I do."}
{"text":"I live 5 minutes away from Rocesescecvaleses but we hardly ever go there.  We keep forgetting it exists I guess.  It's a really nice area despite the HORRIBLE song Julie Black wrote about it for CBC Radio 2.  My brother in-law recommended Cafe Polonez and we all went.  I had the Polonez Chicken Schnitzel and it was great!  Huge portions and great food all around!  The service was awesome and the lady serving us was a sweetheart!  I recommend it highly!    There was one thing though...  Read the next few paragraphs with caution.  Now, this could happen in any restaurant  and by no means is it a reflection of Cafe Polonez, but a criticism of society as a whole!  I asked the delightful lady who served us where the bathrooms were and she directed me downstairs.  I just needed to pee so I just went to the urinal.  Next me was a toilet with a full load in it.  Who the fuck shits, and leaves it there for others to look at?  It looked like somebody dumped a box of cigars in there!  That person is a modern day man-ape!  He relates to the first 30 minutes of 2001: A Space Odyssey!  I tried to leave the bathroom as quick as I could before anybody else came to use it because I would be blamed for the unflushed shit, despite my inevitable enthusiastic denial.  Luckily for me. I got out in time.    Unfortunately, if that wonderful server of ours has to clean the men's bathroom at the end of the night, who will she think of when she sees the exposed, unflushed #2?  Me.  The guy who asked where the bathrooms were.  Anyway, next time you're in Roncesescesvaleseses, check out Cafe Polonez.  It's great!"}
{"text":"My favourite Polish restaurant on Roncesvalles. It is actually family run, with three generations working there. I have quite literally sampled 90% of the menu (try the Dill soup!). The staff are excellent, the prices are reasonable (especially considering the huge portions) and the food is deliciously homemade by your Polish grandmother.  Here's a little tip if you want a simple breakfast fry up and can wait until 11am to eat.   Hidden on the menu amongst the traditional Polish offerings is \"Eggs with ham or bacon and toast - $5.50\".   You always get a basket of fresh rye bread at Cafe Polonez so ask them to hold the toast and add homefries.     The quality of the breakfast is excellent and depending on your luck often includes sliced green onions, tomatoes and/or dill pickles.  p.s. The coffee is excellent and a step up from a greasy spoon."}
{"text":"Yay Polish food! I find a place quite authentic when the waiters struggle to speak English. I eat here once every few months and I've tried almost all of their menu.  Great soups - be it dill pickle or white borsch or any soup of the day. Schnitzels are very tasty too (choice of pork or chicken) and why not?! Afterall the food fried and is dripping in grease. Their 'bouquet' of salads is actually a bouquet- I was never able to finish that much sauerkraut / cole slaw / beets / carrots / something else (you get three of those selections) salad. For the starch I usually opt for pierogis instead of potatoes since that's more delicious.  For drinks, be sure to try some Polish beer; it tastes like turpentine but is excellent to wash the food down."}
{"text":"This place is pretty decent. The place is clean and nice. The staff were quick and friendly. I had the chicken schnitzel dinner with a side of perogies. The food was good but the ratio of meat to vegetables were off. It was basically all cabbage and one piece of meat. And for the price your paying I would expect a decent serving of chicken."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been going to the Polonez for over 10 years now and every time we go the food is consistently yummy.  This is Polish Food at its best.  It's not fancy but it tastes so good and leaves you very satisfied.  The best time to go here is in the winter months.  On a Saturday night there is usually a line waiting for tables. The service is very good and the waitresses very nice.    My favourite is the Goulash which is a pork stew cooked in a wonderful gravy.  The dish comes with potatoes, carrots, coleslaw and beet salad.  It's so good you don't want to stop eating it."}
{"text":"Great place to indulge on Polish food. Great perogies, cabbages and schnitzel. Had the platter for 2 which contains all the necessary items you would want to try.  Dessert was also good with crepes"}
{"text":"It's a very popular spot that is busy every night of the week but well worth any wait for a table. The food is incredible and always consistent. Amazing, beautifully golden and tender schnitzel with fresh made salads deliver incredible flavour and best of all is the red borscht. I've never had a better soup in my life and it might even be the best dish I've ever had, definitely a must-have! If you haven't been to Polonez yet, go now!"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE! My German background has me craving saurkraut, schnitzel, potatoes and of course cabbage rolls. This place has it all - my husband and I always split the platter for 2 - he loves the perogies. When my parents or in-laws come into town this is our go-to place. Everyone enjoys it - and there is so much room. Service is fast and friendly. So happy Cafe Polonez exists!"}
{"text":"Super awesome. Could eat here everyday. Real home cooking. Cozy, no frills, comfort food."}
{"text":"Had the Open Faced Hot Roast Beef.  Nice tender tasty and juicy!  I also ordered the Vegetable Soup and Minced Pork perogies to go.  It was good but the vegetable broth had Cauliflower in it and was Cauliflower white which kind of grosses me out.  Cleanliness and service was 5 star!  Oh yeah and the perogies were awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Just the best:  They give you way too much food.  That food is delicious.  Their wine is amazing (Georgian Saperavi) and well priced.  The service is great.   Huge menu."}
{"text":"I'm surprised to say that Cafe Polonez is one of the best kept secrets in Toronto.  How this place isn't packed, with a line down the street, is beyond me.  I had first visited in April, and for my encore visit this month, it was just as good as I remember it the first time.  For both visits, I ordered the \"Platter for Two\" (Cabbage Rolls, Pirogi, Pork Schnitzel, Sauteed Mushrooms, Hot Sauerkraut, Beet Salad, Fresh Cabbage Slaw, Cucumber Salad).  Normally, I find that restaurant portions tend to be less than advertised.  The \"Platter for Two\", is really enough food for three.  I am a fairly big eater, I can pack a lot of food away, and I'm certifying this meal is not an exaggeration of portion sizes.  The cabbage rolls are the best I've ever had.  If this is the way cabbage rolls were meant to be made, then I'll take a second helping please.  The pork schnitzel was lean and yet perfectly tender.  Pirogi (Cheese/Potato, Sauerkraut/Mushroom) were excellent as to be expected.  The hot sauerkraut is simply incredible; sauerkraut should ALWAYS be served this way.  The beet salad, cabbage slaw, and cucumber salad just round out an incredible balanced and delicious meal.  I didn't grow up eating Polish food, but both my meals here, so far, have felt like I was eating comfort food.  The food was absolutely delicious and it felt like a great home cooked meal."}
{"text":"Just had lunch with my husband here. Like other people's comment, this is a good restaurant. We are definitely coming back here. Next time, I will bring our Polish friends and listen to their reviews.  Good food, good service. If anything is the front entrance of the restaurant not very welcoming. We passed by this place many times and never felt the urge to coming in. But it is a good decision we finally had a taste of it. You will not regret it."}
{"text":"I'm lucky that just down the street from me is what is probably the best Polish restaurant in Toronto. Had borscht, pierogies, bigos, paprikash, pulpety. Everyone agreed the food was fantastic. Looking back, the prices are very fair. Nothing I can fault it on really."}
{"text":"One of my best friends is Polish, and I love going over to her place because her mom feeds me delicious food, homemade sauerkraut and pickles, and an infinite amount of apple cakes and almond cookies. Yumm! So the other day, we found ourselves roaming the Roncesvalles area, hungry and thirsty, and I was seriously craving some warm comfort food.   It was a Thursday night, and the place was pretty busy with patrons who seemed to be enjoying their meals very much. We were told to sit anywhere we liked and given our menus by a young, smiling waitress.   Everything sounded absolutely delicious, but we ended up deciding on the White Easter Borscht and Hungarian style Potato Pancake with Goulash for me, and the Sauerkraut and Mushroom Perogies and Grilled Polish Sausage for him.   The appetizers arrived within a few minutes, and smelled divine! One spoonful of my soup and I was in heaven! Creamy Borscht with slices of Kielbasa and a boiled egg...yummmmm!   The Perogies were equally delicious and served ultra hot, just the way they should be! They came with a side of browned butter (YUMM) and sour cream. These perogies are pretty big, so the 6 they bring out are a very good portion.   The Hungarian style potato and goulash pancake came out, and its MASSIVE. It looked like an omelet on steroids. It was served with a side of beets, cabbage, and steamed carrots and green beans. The pancake was delicious, soft on the inside, crispy on the outside. The Goulash had great flavour and consistency.   The Polish sausage I cannot comment on, as I did not taste it, but my boyfriend devoured it, so I'm assuming it was good! His plate was also MASSIVE, and came with some of the yummiest fries I have ever tasted. Absolutely addicting and delicious! I literally inhaled these, and I'm pretty sure my bf barely got a few.   I was not able to finish all my food, and left about half. When I left I was so ridiculously full, that I could not take in a deep breath without my jean's popping a button to expose my food baby. Yeah, attractive I know.  :)   The meal came to $39.00 or so, and was totally worth the gigantic portions and delicious home made style food. This is comfort food at its best. Filling and satisfying on a chilly autumn evening. Also worh noting, the service was super friendly and attentive without being intrusive.   I cannot wait to come back here to feast on more perogies and soup!  Until then, I'll be visiting my friend's mom more often :)"}
{"text":"This was my first polish dining experience, but I would come back here before risking it someplace else.   Get yourself a huge polish beer and one of the sampling platters! Schnitzels, pierogis, latkes, krauts, slaws.."}
{"text":"Fail.  Drove here because of the reviews.  Sent back the goulash soup, so salty it was inedible.  No apology from waitress.  Ordered the Wiener schnitzel with fried egg.  A tasteless piece of meat.  No flavour at all.  The \"bouquet of salads\" was a TINY scoop of fried sauerkraut, a TINY scoop of beet salad, and a TINY scoop of coleslaw, with, get this....TASTELESS boiled potatoes with sprinkled dill on top.  And after sending inedible soup back, wouldn't a waitress need to check if \"everything is ok\" after the entree is brought?  Nope!  She never came around, then I had to beg for the bill in an almost EMPTY restaurant.  That took them almost 15 minutes to produce.  Absolutely tasteless $20 meal.  Terrible schnitzel and I know schnitzel!  Don't waste your time and money here, even Country Style's schnitzel is better than this crap."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for years. The food is generally good and so is the service. The place has bad acoustics, it can be very noisy. My favourite is the Bigos which is cabbage and sausages, the beet salad is fabulous and so are the  Pirogies, in my opinion the Schnitzel is not great, it's too thick and the breading is limp. The Nalishniki (crepes) are an excellent dessert. If you like  homestyle Eastern European food, then you will enjoy this restaurant."}
{"text":"Me and my husband had a dinner at Café Polonez about a week ago.  Its not fancy but it just felt so homey. I liked their service even though we were waiting for 20mins.   We ordered the platter for 2( it comes with perogies,  schnitzel,  cabbage roll, beet salad etc) and we just LOVE IT. We went to a couple of another European restaurant and I thought they were good too but, this place is winner so far!! We also tried their polish crepes with coffee and they were delicious too. We will definitely come back to try potato pancake and so on !"}
{"text":"I am a Ukrainian girl, my Baba passed away over two years ago and I have not eaten 'REAL' perogies since the last meal she made me. My mom took me here for my birthday telling me how good the food was. I had no hope for the food to be good quality cause all the other perogies I ever tried other then my Baba's were just potatoes and salt. We ordered way to much food which was great cause I had left overs to munch on. The perogies were great, not Baba's, but defiantly close. I really liked the cabbage rolls, they were very different then the ones she used to make us. The tomato sauce was sweet but still good. We also ordered the schnitzel melt which was amaaazzze. I will definitely be going back and have already told my friends about this place. I couldn't have asked a better present for my birthday eating here brought back a lot of memories and had my mom and me sharing Baba stories. Thanks Cafe Polonez!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend is of Polish descent so decided to have some traditional food. Wow - incredible stuff. As an eastern european myself, I did know most of the food or had it in some form or another back home - but the place blew me away how good it was. The place is extremely clean and the service is efficient and pleasant. Portions are massive (the sample main platter for ONE fed myself and my girlfriend to the point that we couldn't move after). Just a platter for one had 6 pierogies (can mix and match which type to put there), bigos (cabbage), schnitzel (with mushroom topping) and beet salad. Wash it down with a Lezajsk beer and the meal is complete! Prices very affordable given the size of the meal. The only problem is that Polish food in general tends to be heavy and relatively oily (minimal veggies) - so you will feel absolutely glutinous after. But it was an awesome experience and loved this place!"}
{"text":"Beef Goulash, only place to eat goulash is here. And I can never resist their fresh home made perogies!!!"}
{"text":"The Roncy also known as Little Poland houses many polish eats however this one takes top mark for the best dine in experience. Authentic, home style dishes you would think babcia (grandma) is cooking away in the kitchen.  Extensive menu with all the Polish specialties, cabbage rolls, pierogies, hunter's stew, schnitzels, red/white borsht, potato dumplings, potato pancakes, goulash, and full bar.   Ordered the platter for two can easily eat three. Huge portions! Two cabbage rolls, 6 perogies of your choice, 2 pork schnitzels, bigos/ hunter stews and three large salads (beet/cabbage/carrots).  Lots of vegetarian options just be careful with the sauces as some are meat based.  Dessert try the crepes (nalesniki)  For beverages try Kompot (fruit cooked in water and lightly sweetened) or Zywiec (Polish beer- pale lager).  Service is excellent. You gotta eat here!"}
{"text":"Lovely Roncesvalles staple.  The Dill Pickle soup is fantastic (only served on Fridays I believe.)  Everything I have tried on the menu is great and reasonably priced.  Would recommend to anyone willing to try it."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! Portions are huge and very reasonably priced. I love their soups and homemade perogies. The best cabbage rolls I've ever had."}
{"text":"They've had delicious pierogi that definitely remind me of my mother's ones. Everything was good and tasty and the location is rather comfortable to find them."}
{"text":"Great food...great service... The fact it's packed on a Sunday night proves a point about its popularity... Definitely a winner!"}
{"text":"Pretty great Euro style for Toronto.  I would try to hit Cafe Polonez when it's busy but not extremely busy. Last time I went it was late and a bit dead, and the food seemed to be reheated from the earlier rush. Lifeless cold potatoes and soggy Polish schnitzel were the giveaways that the kitchen was running on standby after 8:30 pm, just filling plates but it was still an ok meal with the usual great sides (some of them freezing cold) and a crispy sausage I ordered as well.  On other visits  I've had the very decent cabbage rolls, some pierogis and - incredibly - a half roast duck for 21 bucks. All hearty and filling with good flavours, the duck could have been served just a little hotter. So not the perfect Poland experience but I really enjoy this place, when I can actually get in the door, and in this city hard to beat value for the dollar. A must try."}
{"text":"Wanted: Young Polish man who can make me perogies and potato pancakes like this place (or has a mother who will cook for me).  Requirements: *Hot and steamy borscht soup with tender meat dumplings... *Freshly made perogies topped with onions and sour cream, mouthfuls of goodness... *Cabbage rolls, firm enough and just the right size.. not too meaty..with the right amount of tasty sauce... *Potato pancake, so mind-blowing you can't wait to tell your friends... *Sweet fruit Capote that keeps you wanting more.  Yeah baby, yeah."}
{"text":"Im no Pole but many of my friends are and we all love going to this place. Babcia swears by the Flaczky there. I really love the goulash (ask for the potato dumplings instead of potatoes that come with it). Really hardy and delicious. Zurek soup is pretty good there too (farmers yeast soup).  Casual atmosphere and laid back. One of the best of Roncey."}
{"text":"My mom picked us up take-out (tried to order ahead but no answer but it wasn't too much long of a wait)  I got the beet soup with mushroom dumplings in it.  I also got 2 6 piece orders of pierogi (cheddar & potato and saurkraut and cottage cheese). I got mine boiled (no bacon).  LOVED THEM!! great portion prizes (will be enjoying leftovers tomorrow!  My mom got hers fried (potato and cheddar also no bacon). She enjoyed hers as well.  I was very impressed with the vegetarian options on the menu!! Will definitely be back:)"}
{"text":"My wife happened to find this place because I love winer schnitzel and boy what a great choice she did. . Excellent choice."}
{"text":"Non-pretentious polish comfort food. Portions are large. Decent selection of beers. The food is on point. Service was good both times I've been here."}
{"text":"Yay! I'm a fan. Yes I am, and I cannot wait to go back. Server just made a little hiccup with her skills though and had to be reminded what we ordered that never landed our table until we reminded her like after two times. However, the taste of the food made up for it.  YUMMY polish food... SCHNITZEL, Pierogi, Goulash... etc.  I went here on a Sunday afternoon with a my two siblings and two bestfriends. We all ordered different dishes that were all amazing... except for my friend's roast chicken...a bit dry.  We ordered a mix of pierogi.. beef goulash soup.. the polonez schnitzel (YUMMMMMM, and huge ass portions), roast beef (omg this one was amazing, can't get enough of it), the beef liver (sounds gross, but sooooooooo good)... everything was really good! I cannot wait to go back even though its all the way at the Roncey, so far from Scarborough but I'm willing to sit my ass in that long ass subway ride to Dundas West from Kennedy... just to get my hands on some of these awesome food again.   I cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"WE had planned to try out 9 cafe the other night. It is close top where we live and the menu looked interesting. However,upon sitting down ,the first 3 three items were not available.  After a 4th absence on the menu we decided to go to polonez. Prompt friendly service. Excellent hearty food. I had Schnitzel Polonez,She had goulah in a pancake. Yummy. Go there before Roncesvalles gentrification is complete. I jest I suspect they own the building and the place does huge business. It is going nowhere."}
{"text":"My sweetheart and I visited Café Polonez a few weeks ago for dinner. I was a tad sceptical about the restaurant, as I'm Polish and have never eaten Polish food that tastes better than the delicious creations that emerge from my parents' kitchen (sadly only during the holidays).   We started our dinner with the Barszcz (or beet soup) with meat dumplings. The barszcz was served with a good degree of spice (which is traditional). The meat dumplings were quite nice too - Though my mom serves her barszcz with mushroom and onion dumplings, which I'd have to say that I prefer over the meat dumplings.   We then had the steak tartar - not something that I'd recommend for those with weak stomachs or those who fear raw meat and eggs (and I'm sure there are many of you). I personally enjoyed it quite a bit, primarily because it reminded me of the tartar that my dad made when I was a child.   For the main course, we shared the Hungarian style placki (or potato pancakes). These were delicious! They were served super hot, with quite a bit of goulash and various cabage-based salads on the side. I must say that they were quite comparable to my dad's potato pancakes.   Overall, our dining experience at Café Polonez was a great one. The portion size were quite large, and the food truly was authentically Polish. I'd recommend the restaurant for those seeking a true Polish dining experience.   A handy tip: Groupon often offers a daily deal for Café Polonez where you can get $20 worth of food for $10 if you purchase the Groupon on the day of your meal."}
{"text":"So I hardly watch You Gotta Eat Here but I was convinced by friends who do that I should check it out. As I am a fan of Polish fare I decided to give it a go with them.   When we walked in we had the place almost to ourselves at 6:30.  We got a seat at the back and the waitress was helpful in telling us what the Polish named dishes were. We had the platter for 2 (schnitzel, cabbage roll, pierogies along with saierkraut, beets, carrots) and a Polish sausage, and a pancake wrapping a goulash filling.   The platter for two was off the hook, especially the cabbage roll which had just the right sweetness in the sauce. Schnitzel was also good, though I thought it could have used more pounding flat and breading. The Polish sausage was grilled to perfection. The pancake itself was delicious,  but the goulash filling itself didn't live up to the other dishes.   As we left around 8 we noticed that the whole place seemed to be filled with regulars, some just stopping by for a beer. Overall seemed like a favourite local spot, and would visit again."}
{"text":"Love-love-love this place.  Hearty, delicious Polish comfort food, reasonably priced and courteously served.  The golabki plate comes with generous portions of beet salad, dill potatoes, and coleslaw, and easily feeds two (especially with a side order of tasty pierogi!)  Definitely a favourite dinner destination, and one that I recommend to all of my friends."}
{"text":"Loved this place enough to have my family only wedding reception here. I'd like to be friends with this restaurant. You know, bro-down and BFF forever?  I'm sure that if you ordered all the wrong things, and maybe you didn't like meat, bread, cabbage and pierogies you could walk out not completely satisfied. Otherwise, you are doomed to have the most authentic and delicious Polish meal of your life at a very fair price.  Things to try: cabbage/mushroom pierogies, bigos, borscht, schnitzel, potato pancakes and any of the salads. I'm sure most of the other stuff is awesome too, but this is where the restaurant truly shines.  If you live or are visiting Toronto... DO IT."}
{"text":"Have been coming here for nearly 20 years and never anything but excellent consistent service. Great serving sizes and you can order half plate too. Love the perogies. And cabbage rolls. And the roast beef. Unbelievable value for your money. And spotlessly clean."}
{"text":"Located in the heart of Roncesvalles (aka little Poland) this place is the real deal. When we went, it was full of Polish families (always a good sign!)  Cafe Polonez offers platters perfect for sharing with a family or group. Pierogis, schnitzel, sausages, sauerkraut. For Toronto locals,you really need to add this authentic Polish restaurant to your list of must try spots in the city. We loved it."}
{"text":"I have been going here for around 12 years and I love it.  Everything tastes fresh and home made and is delicious. Definitely the best Pierogi and one of the best Schnitzels I have had in Toronto.   I am not Polish, but if I was, this is how my mom's cooking would taste like! The only reason I give it 4/5 stars instead of 5/5 is that it could get a little bit pricy (specially the way I order every time I go to Polonez!) but on the plus side, the portions are VERY generous so you will be fully satisfied.  In conclusion, I don't always go to Roncesvalles, but when I do, I go to Polonez!"}
{"text":"Great Polish comfort food and excellent service.   The Potatoe Pancake is THE DISH to get if it is your first time with pyrogies for an appeitizer if you have a large appetitie."}
{"text":"I'm Polish, so naturally, I wanted to experience some of my Polish heritige while visiting Toronto. So, after a long, long walk (Toronto is NOT pedestrian friendly), I had some pretty decent food.  The food is definately not as good as those places I've visited in Chicago and the menu was kind of weird. It seems like a mixture of American / Canadian and Polish. I say stick with the Polish!  The service was good and a special mention to my new favorite beer, Warka. But, I'd probably try another Polish restaurant in the area before heading back here."}
{"text":"I'm 1/4 polish, but it was the predominant ethnic influence on my life growing up. I have fond memories of rye bread, borscht, and making pierogis as a family. So when it comes to polish food, I have a pretty good idea of what I'm looking for.  Cafe Polonez meets about 95% of my needs. The good: 1. their stuffed cabbage is amazing. Tender cabbage, good filling, and a great tomato sauce. Super duper. 2. their beet salad is the most divine thing. so simple yet so awesomely tasty. 3. the white borscht with kielbasa is, I almost hesitate to say, better than babcias. Smooth and lightly tangy, best eaten with buttered rye bread dipped in. 4. amazing portions for the price. it is impossible to leave this place hungry. If you are hungry after, well, you're doing it wrong.  The not as good, but still tasty: 1. their pierogis. I will have to qualify this in that I've only had them once. However, they weren't the best pierogis I've had. These are something my babcia definitely does better. However, I am going to give them another chance to see if maybe I was just asking too much of them the first time I had them. If you've never had homemade pierogis, you will find these much tastier than the frozen pre-made ones in the store. They are also very plentiful and filling.  Overall, I will eat here whenever I can again convince my husband to eat here. If I had my way, I'd probably eat here at least once a week!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service. A real home cooked meal at affordable prices.  The food is very authentic and large portions which does make it tough to eat light. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"A brisk 10 min walk from high Park lies one of the tastiest and authentic polish restaurants I've ever visited. It's a small quaint restaurant that's bustling with patrons, either waiting in line or getting take out. The platter for two came out with huge portions of perogies, chicken schnitzel, cabbage rolls, beets, coleslaw and pickles.  The perogies and cabbage rolls were great but their schnitzel was exceptional. It was tender and lightly breaded, full of flavor and texture. I definitely will come back if I'm ever close to Roncesvalles again!"}
{"text":"We were told there was a wait of 30 minutes for a table for 2, but we waited 1.5+ hours out in the cold and wind because they don't have an inside waiting area. There were empty tables for two, but instead of sitting us, they just kept kept pinning them together with other tables to form tables of 4+, to sit parties that came AFTER us.  We were watching through the window and a table was waiting for their food for about an hour after they ordered. They'd say down about the same time that we had started waiting.  The menu consists of ~$20-30 schnitzel (fried chicken/pork) and pierogies. It'd be about 30+ per person... For schnitzel  The issue is that this place got WAY over hyped by the TV show \"you gotta eat here.\" This is our 13th or 14th \"you gotta eat here\" restaurant that we try, and in general they're just not worth it."}
{"text":"Solid 4 stars! Great value and great comfort food. Portions are very generous, enough for   a lunch the next day. We have been coming here for a few years and are never disappointed. There best meals are the polish style ribs (nothing to do with your American bbq ribs), the paprikash, and the beet soup. Don't forget to switch your potatoes with perogies!!!"}
{"text":"I adore Cafe Polonez. Five stars!! Not only is the food amazing but the warmth of the friendly staff shines through every time. Perfect for a casual or intimate dinner date or group of friends meeting for dinner. Either/or. Living in the area for over 12 years, i know sometimes the place gets full but that's because they are a beating heart of Roncesvalles Village!!  People line up outside sometimes to get in for this delicious menu. My mom in her 80's had schnitzel for the first time here with me and loved it. Reading reviews tonight that make reference to ethnicity or age of staff somehow contributing to a lack of good service is an outrage. Ethnicity nor age are not issues to this amazing restaurant. In Roncesvalles Village, EVERYONE is welcome."}
{"text":"Went here with a party of 7 after a hard morning of volleyball!  Location/Service Street parking is available if you plan to drive, but suggested if you carpool to save time and gas. Easy to find location and very family-feel oriented interior.  Waitresses were very nice and knowledgeable as I don't have much experience with Polish food. They were also quick when we wanted something extra like olive oil for the bread of extra plates for sharing.   Food Ordered the platter for 2, which pretty much has everything they specialize in.  The pork schnitzel was the biggest portion. It was a little dry to my tasting, but adding in with the beets and veggies gave it a good mix.  Also ordered a few varieties of perogies. They were very delicious since it's comfort food with a lot of the filling. The best was the mushroom and cheese. Next was the pork. If you have a larger party, it's the best option to share as an appetizer.  Tried the potato pancake Hungarian style. This was interesting since it was like a pancake wrap/taco. There were fillings inside so potion was very enough. Again also tops off with side dishes to balance it out.   I would love to come here again since I haven't experience much Polish cuisine. I think it would be better to come here with a few people since there is a wide selection of food on their menu!"}
{"text":"Oh %$#@&.... this place is amazing. I'm giving it five stars on the basis that its easily the best Polish food in Toronto.    I was fortunate enough to grow up with many polish neighbours most of my life and had the pleasure of sampling traditional Polish home cooking for over 20 years. Cafe Polonez destroyed everything I previously sampled in the past.  The restaurant looks great, very European with beautiful artwork. Service was excellent with three female servers handling the whole restaurant with military precision. (The servers all appeared to be Polish or Eastern European)   Interesting Polish beer selections with 8-10 unique Polish beers I never tried before (in bottle or on tap). I tried 3 different beers and all were enjoyable The beer is rather smooth and easy to drink (hence the 3 beers). Most tables were enjoying a beer with their meals.   Now on to the food. I recommend the combo platters for one, two or four - a great way to sample the different types of Polish specialties. Portions were generous and priced fairly. A giant platter for two was $35. The standouts included:  - Best cabbage rolls ever!!!!! OMG, I had the biggest smile on my face as I savoured every bite. I panicked when mine was gone and I seriously considered stealing my fellow Yelpers only roll. This is a must try. The rice/meat stuffing is incredible.  - Perogies were killer and offered with a variety of fillings (everything from basic potato / cheese to sauerkraut). You can even get frozen ones to bring home with you.  - Schnitzel was also amazing, better than the Austrian and German versions of this dish in my opinion (and I'm German). The pork was so tender and the batter not nearly as greasy. It was covered in sautéd mushrooms.  - Potato pancakes were another standout. Not healthy but these deep fried potato pancakes just melted in your mouth. Add sour cream and be happy!  - The platters come with cole slaw, sauerkraut, beet and carrot salads which acted as nice palette refresher between main dishes.     European home cooking at it's best. You feel like your in Poland eating at the home of a friendly local. I only wish I didn't live so far away..... but I would consider moving to be closer to this place.       Tip - It's a block or two away from the Popular Barque, come here instead of waiting in line for BBQ.  BK"}
{"text":"Very delicious. We got the platter for 4 - be warned, it is NOT for four people. It is for far more than four people.  The schnitzel was solid, the sauerkraut was good, the cabbage rolls were good, the perogis (cheese) were delicious, sausages were delicious, potato dumplings were delicious, and the hunter's stew was good (I preferred the sauerkraut in this).  We also ordered the paprikash which is nice too."}
{"text":"If you want authentic home-cooked Polish food in TO, you've come to the right place. Niesamowite!  I have to admit, I was completely new to Polish cuisine before I came here. The closest thing I've had to Polish food was frozen pirogi. So I decided to try the stuff your babcia might have made:  Starter: Barszcz with meat dumplings (a.k.a. Borscht) App: Cabbage rolls stuffed with rice & pork topped with tomato sauce Main: Paprykarz Wolowy (Paprika infused beef stew with peppers)  The borscht soup was simply delicious. A good way to start the meal. The cabbage rolls were really good and a definite traditional polish staple. But what really got me was the Paprykarz. I've never had beef this good! My #1 recommendation at Cafe Polonez.  As everyone mentions, the portions are huge and the prices are cheap. Come here hungry and you'll STILL have enough leftovers for lunch tomorrow.  With an amazing assortment of Polish beers (I recommend the Warka) and lots of different Polish vokdas, Cafe Polonez was a great intro into Polish cusine.  I'll definitely be back here!"}
{"text":"This place is on point. There are so many amazing food options I don't know where to start. Shout out for sure goes to the sausages which brings me back all he time! And the perogies with the sauce and sour cream is over the top mouth watering!!!! Service is friendly always and conversational. I always feel very at home there."}
{"text":"Schnitzel was great but I was disappointed with the sides. We also had the stuffed cabbage rolls, which had a bit too much tomato sauce.  Service was nothing special.  Will be back to try different things."}
{"text":"Great authentic polish restaurant in Toronto with excellent service. Pierogies and potato pancakes are a must have! Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Great little restaurant on Roncesvalles!! Waitress recommended one of their most popular dishes--platter for two--which included schnitzel with mushrooms, cabbage rolls, perogies, sauerkraut, salad, beets and cabbage slaw. The portion was huge and worth it. The cheese and potato perogies were among the best I've ever had and the schnitzel was moist and flavourful, as good as the ones i've tried in Germany! The veggie sides added a nice variety of flavour to the platter and I'm happy that I got to try a fair assortment of their most raved-about food items. Will definitely be back to try more for that last star!"}
{"text":"The only thing my fiancé loves more than me is the Polenez schnitzel! The goulash stuffed potato pancake is so indulgent buy yowza, the best on a cold fall day! Plan a walk or bike ride home to help with the carb heavy food but they do it so so well!"}
{"text":"Nothing special - I do not understand what the fuss is all about after seeing so many people queued up for tables.  The waitress was nice and helpful. However the food was just average. Frankly, I liked the President's Choice frozen cabbage rolls that you buy from Loblaws better than the ones they served there. The beets were good though."}
{"text":"Third time was a charm!  They have the Gruner Veltliner back on the wine list and the service, food and portions were all bang on. We both began with the Dill Soup which was absolutely outstanding. Perfect consistency and bursting with fresh dilly deliciousness! My friend had the Platter for one and I had the Pulpety. Convinced that I did not really like schnitzel, I was stunned whenI tried a bite of the chicken schnitzel on my friend's plate. I've always thought that flat pounded and breaded meat was dry, but it was moist and flavourful. The Bigos is the best I've had in Toronto and I could eat this stuff forever. My friend had her pierogies pan fried, mine were boiled, just like my Polish Gramma used to make! And the Pulpety were tender and draped in more yummy dill.  Super delicious! Love it!"}
{"text":"Definitely recommend! A hidden breakfast gem!"}
{"text":"A great place for a big, tasty platter of European comfort.    The prices are reasonable and the portions are generous.   (So generous that the sampler platter for two was more than we could finish.)    I like stopping in here on a cold day for one of the daily soups. It's also a great spot for old-school specialties like cabbage rolls."}
{"text":"Some of the best food I've ever had, this includes all cuisines...this place is an absolute gem."}
{"text":"HUBBA BABBA! HOLY MOLY! OH MY GAWD! GAWD DAYAM YESSS!! That's what ran through my head when our food arrived at our table. But what I really uttered through my lips was only \"oh my gawd! That's alllllot of food! Proportions are fricken huge here!\"  Marie B, I'm upset at you. You've been holding back. Why have you only recently introduced me to this place? I should of been dining here on the regular ever since your initial visit. But better late than never...  The food here is mmmmmm gooooooood.... verrrrry gooooood....  We started off with assorted perogies - damn good! One of the best I've ever had. As my main, I had the Friday special (only $14.50) - comes with soup, fillet of sole, potatoes, beet salad, cucumber salad and coleslaw. I chose the mushroom soup - damn good! & homemade for sure! The rest of my meal - you got it, all damn good!  3 of my companions had the potato pancake filled with meat & gravy (aka goulash) that Kim B writes about in a previous review. And she's right, I too stared at their dish green with envy (but I don't eat meat on Fridays during Lent). But no worries. I was able to take some home. And even the day after it was damn good!  Our other companion had the ribs and that too was apparently damn good! (I didn't try any though.)  Great, efficient service. Very reasonable prices - I'd say you get too much for what you pay for. Tasty, hearty, delicious Polish food. Cozy ambiance.  We did however get a few initial odd glares from some customers - don't think they've seen 4 Filipinos accompanying 1 Caucasian step foot into the restaurant at the same time before. But that doesn't matter...  I will return. I already know what I'll be ordering - perogies to start and the potato pancake with goulash plus there'll be lots leftover to bring home! I love it when restaurants give too much food!"}
{"text":"OMG! Very very good Polish restaurant. And the beer? Also good  This place will be a good investment for your money and the value that comes with it. You can tell everything's cook from scratch!   Gotta eat here. Great spot!"}
{"text":"We had the cabbage roll meal.  It was delicious!  It had vegetables, red cabbage salad, and potatoes. Everything tasted really fresh and tasty.  Really authentic Polish food.  The service was great as well, and the restaurant was very clean and elegant."}
{"text":"Excellent comfort food.  Definitely not a light lunch, but very tasty.  The Hungarian potato pancakes as fantastic!"}
{"text":"U loved eating there the schnitzel was really good. And the portions was really huge so beware of ordering too much. Lively place for a group or family. Street parking available"}
{"text":"Cafe Polonez is Polish Toronto at it's best - excellent food, great service, wonderful atmosphere. Not in any way kitschy, Polonez is a classic restaurant with a great casual vibe, and Torontonians of all stripes can be seen here, day or night. The place can get rowdy sometimes, but it's always in good fun - it's never quiet here, for sure. A great place to come with friends or a group. My only complaint would be that  their beers (all Polish! Yay!) should be on tap, and their placzki (potato pancakes) aren't all that good. I would suggest you try the gol?bki, the duck, or the soups - they also have awesome combination platters combining a bit of everything- great value and variety of tastes."}
{"text":"Wow.... The best goulash and potatoe pancakes EVER!!  The herring app was a generous mound of salads and two large filets of fish.  Borscht was light and refreshing.  The goulash could be put on cardboard and I would eat it.  So rich and dreamy creamy mmmmm. Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"This is the only Polish place I know of so I have no comparison. I'm so glad I came here. I'm always down for trying new things. The food is good and definitely has a different feel to it. I've never had Polish food before but this feels really Polish for reasons I can't put my finger on.   We had the potato pancake with goulash inside, and a platter for 1. Food was absolutely delicious. Portion is massive too. I'm typically a big eater but I couldn't finish. The platter for 1 comes with pierogies and schnitzel covered with mushrooms. Both dishes have the veggies (beets, coleslaw, sauerkraut).  Price is higher than what I usually pay for casual dinning but when you consider the portion, it's worth it. I wish they served smaller portions and lowered the price a bit.   It's far from my home but I'm already thinking of excuses to come to this area."}
{"text":"Enfin un vrai restaurant à Toronto, la Polish Sausage est un classique ! Mon assiette est repartie toute propre en cuisine. Les schnitzels sont divins, et tout ça à un prix super bas. Allez y les yeux fermés !"}
{"text":"Stop 2 of #AdasFoodCrawl  Huge portions. A short walk from the 1st stop, we were afraid we couldn't continue after this, but an excellent stop for brunch, lunch or dinner. This is Ada T's favourite restaurant.   Fresh perogies, and the Hungarian Potato Pancake was excellent and fills you right up. We got a side of the cabbage roll ($2) which was a great way to have a taster.   The service, was quick. Sunday morning, around 11:30am, the place was fairly empty even though I was able to make a reservation."}
{"text":"Love Polonez Schnitzel. Bar is great. Service A+. Great for family lunch or dinner. Easy to get by ttc. Comfy and friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Polish restaurant in Toronto. The place is very clean and professional. The waitresses are very attentive. The portions are huge and the food is amazing. I highly recommend the duck or the Hungarian pancake. The prices are more than fair."}
{"text":"This is a bit of a trek for me being in Roncy, but it's worth it for comfy, hearty Polish food.   Inside has the look of a homestyle, country restaurant definitely not fancy but a neighborhood restaurant.   Service is quick and attentive and there's plenty of the good stuff on the menu to choose from. Their soups are awesome here, I've had the mushroom and dill and the borsht with dumplings-both hit the spot on a cold night! Their perogies can't be beat, they are soft, pillowy treasures-my favorites being the sauerkraut (sp?) and the cheese.   They have specials each night which come with salad and soup-quite the deal and their portions are ample here."}
{"text":"Great food! Generous portions! and the fries are super crispy and delicious!   Never a bad meal at this place."}
{"text":"I saw this on the Food Network show \"You Gotta Eat Here\", and boyy were they right, you DO gotta eat here! :D  We had the platter for two ($32) which included 2 cabbage rolls, 2 schnitzel, 6 perogies and 4 different salads (beet, coleslaw, green beans, and something else). The cabbage rolls were moist and flavorful, and the tomato sauce that they put on top was perfect with the rolls. The schnitzels were crispy, with some lightly-friend mushrooms on top. We chose the mushroom and saurkraut perogies, which were very unique and delicious!   Please visit this place. Now."}
{"text":"Dill pickle soup.  Try the dill pickle soup.  You will thank me.  Oh and everything else is good too.  PS I think they only offer DPS once a week?"}
{"text":"This restaurant is absolutely amazing! From the cute interior to the most adorable server ever (Joanna), to food that only is rivaled by my grandmother... (Sorry mom!!) Every bit of my experience was absolutely PERFECT! I seldom give a perfect score to ANYTHING... But this one is well deserved.  Tip: Order the Dinner for 2 for the most amazing value! Everything on one plate that makes you miss your baba..."}
{"text":"I came here with s few friends and it was a great experience. I highly recommend this place!  What we ordered to share: 1.potato dumplings with goulash gravy: 9/10 great dish altogether. 2. Cabbage rolls (1 pork and 1 mushroom): 8/10 The potato and pork were good but the mushroom was not that great."}
{"text":"Really good cabbage rolls and perogies with huge portions! However it's best to make reservations as the restaurant gets very busy at dinner time."}
{"text":"Super good no-nonsense polish food.  Nice interior, friendly service. Worth a trip!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I always go for the same two faves - white borscht and potato pancakes. Be patient if you go at peak times - it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious authentic Polish food . Best in the city i highly recommend the potato pancake Hungarian style . I ended up coming back three days in a row and ordering it . Worth the wait i think i want to go back right now im getting hungry writing this review ."}
{"text":"You really can't go wrong at café Polonez,  nothing to complain about.    To start the waitress brought complimentary bread and butter to our table; looked likenit was about half a loaf of sliced rye bread and a plentiful amount of butter pots.  I got the 12 perogies to start, there were 5 flavours to choose from but I stuck to the classic cheddar and potato filling. These are considered to be the best perogies in they city (according to BlogTO) and I've gotta say I agree! The consistency was perfect,  and they had a lot of filling too. It came with a side of sour cream and a side of butteres garlic.  The 12 cost $11.25.  For my main, I ordered the schnitzel melt; your choice of either pork tenderloin or chicken (I chose pork), topped with nelted cheese and sauted mushrroms mashed potato side, and 3 different types of aide salads.  The schnitzel was AMAZING! So tender! So flavourful! So big! I could only eat half of it,  I was stuffed! The only slaw salad I wasn't too much of a fan of was the purple turnip one....a little sweet for my liking, but I guess that's just a case of personal preference. This dish was $18.25 I believe,  well worth it for the flavour, quality, and especially considering the mass amounts of leftovers haha!  My boyfrind got a roast beef sandwich which was smothered in a delicious gravy, accompanied by mashed potatoes, slaw salad, cagge and carrots and beans on the side. Again, a massive quantity!  I tried a bit of the roast and it was unbelievably tender....clearly it was slow cooked to perfection. Hos plate was also about $18.  We also ordered a drink and after tip ended up spending about $50. Certainly not the cheapest meal I've had, but the money went toward some top qualitt food, so it was well worth it. Plus, we took home enough leftovers to last another meal aha!"}
{"text":"I really hate to knock an old-style Eastern European place serving homestyle food - the way to my heart, especially because there aren't as many around. This restaurant, however, is not as good as I would've expected based on the 4.5 star average rating.  Most of my Eastern European food experiences have been of the Hungarian variety, and I love and treasure the Hungarian food I've been able to get in Toronto. I was expecting Cafe Polonez, though Polish, to have roughly similar dishes prepared in roughly similar ways, and this ended up being true. I ordered the paprikash with potato and cheddar perogies instead of the potatoes.  The food took a bit to come, but arrived fresh. The perogies were really good, definitely homemade but not overly oily or fatty. The filling was good - no complaints. The salads - I honestly don't remember much about them, but I feel like the beets were good. I mean, I like beets and all. I don't even know that I tried much else of the salads - just not my thing.  The paprikash was basically why this wasn't 4 stars. The meat was nice - good texture, tender enough that you can cut the cubes with a fork but not too tender that it's turned into mush or fallen apart. The sauce/broth/stew was hearty and all, but I found it extremely tomato-y. This didn't quite jibe with the mushrooms and cooked onions, and might have been exacerbated by a few too many peppers.  Service was solid. I actually thought the price was a little high for what you get, but it's a nice space and all and the portions definitely aren't small. You could get two meals out of it - I didn't, partially because I didn't like it enough to pack it up for the trek home.  I liked it. I did not love it. If I were in the area, I would give it serious consideration. Would I make a trip there? No."}
{"text":"I went to Cafe Polonez for the first time tonight & it was absolutely amazing!! My dad & I split the pierogi's, polonez schnitzel & potato pancakes, they were all delicious!! We would drive from Burlington for this delicious food anyday. Our waitress was also wonderful. She was very polite & appreciative that we enjoyed the food so much. I wish more restaurants operated this way. Thank you for the great experience. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent, authentic and quality Polish food.  Large sized portions as well which always makes me enjoy my food a little more."}
{"text":"Wanted to check out this establishment for a while. My sister's visiting Toronto and was game to drive down to Roncy for some Polish grub so off to Cafe Polonez we went !  We ordered the Platter for 2. For $32, you get bang for your buck. Schnitzel, cabbage roll, some sort of shredded beet concoction, pierogis ... you're completely and utterly STUFFED at the end of your meal. The cabbage roll was a tad underwhelming; the sauce was very much like ketchup, but pork/rice filling was pretty good.  The only thing that I didn't like was the service. It was quite slow ... I felt that we had to wait for a while for our meals. Regardless, I'd like to come back as their potato pancake looked deeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeelicious.  A solid four star."}
{"text":"After work on Saturday evening, my friend and I went out for Polish food at Café Polonez, and it was an excellent meal, even better than I remember from my previous visit. The restaurant is very simple inside, no decoration except for a large painting on the back wall. But it was very bright and clean, including the washroom according to my friend. The service was also very friendly, the atmosphere and pace good for conversation, and there is a wide selection on the menu.  As for our food, everything was excellent. We shared an appetizer of 12 cheese pierogi with sour cream, boiled just right so that they were tender but didn't fall apart. We then shared two entrees of chicken schnitzel and pan-fried sole. The sole was lightly breaded, also tender but not flaky, and I would say probably the best of all the fine dishes. Each entree came with potatoes which were okay but nothing special, and an assortment of side salads. The salads were much more tasty - a sweet carrot and apple, shredded beets with horseradish we thought, and coleslaw. I followed all this with a nice bottle of Polish beer - Zywiec.  Overall, the meal was excellent, and only $60 for two people, including taking home a few pierogi and some schnitzel and salads. Definitely a solid recommendation, and I expect to return to try other dishes. I actually started this review as a 4-star but then couldn't think of anything that was lacking (especially after the rave review of the washroom), so I had to change it to a 5-star instead - As good as it gets!."}
{"text":"TLDR; Come here for a cozy, fabulous, no-frills Sunday meal. This is the kind of place you want to write a fake negative review about so you can keep it to yourself. Portion sizes are massive.  FOOD  I have thoroughly enjoyed every meal I have eaten here. The food is homey, and consistent. Skip the free bread at the beginning, it's not that good and will fill you up. My favourites here (after trying a ton of the menu) are:  Cabbage rolls with mushrooms (must order!) Cheese and Potato Dumplings Hunter's Stew  Beet Root soup with mushroom dumplings  You can't go wrong here. If there is something on the menu that interests you, I can guarantee its well prepared.   AMBIENCE  Feels like you're at your grandmas for Sunday dinner. Service isn't the best, but they're generally slammed so I can understand."}
{"text":"Went here last year and don't know why it took me a year to write this review!  Authentic, comfort, and filling will be my 3 words to describe this staple in Roncy.  I recommended and came here with my co-workers for our xmas lunch.   We ordered soups, salads, pierogies for apps, from those alone we would have been full I think. Large portions of freshly cooked food were served piping hot to our table. The beet stew I had was delicious and simple but I regretted my choice after someone else ordered the beef stew!  For mains two of us split the meal for 2...what were we thinking? Both of us sat there laughing for a good solid 5 minutes with our faces turning red... it was enough food for a table of 6. I actually fed my bf and myself the next day with half the left overs.   Schnitzels were great thickness and battered nicely. The cabbage rolls were traditional and authentic with flavors only a long cooking time could develop. We ordered a side of potato pancakes and they were crispy on the outside but fluffy and warm on the inside.   Friendly service with a nice atmosphere.   If I still ate meat, I'd go back in a heart beat!"}
{"text":"This is a good place to try Eastern European food for the first time. I wouldn't recommend it for a (romantic or non-romantic) date, as it's popular, and therefore busy and loud. Vegetarian options are very few indeed. I don't think I'd go back here again, because of the ambience, and that the food was just 'ok'."}
{"text":"Stick to your ribs, home cooked goodness! It's rare to find a meal this good.   Both my fellow diner and I each ordered the platter for one - it comes with pork schnitzel, hunter's stew (basically a warm cabbage salad with a bit of sausage), coleslaw, beet salad and a few pirogies. We also shared a side of potatoes and a small serving of goulash gravy. I'm a big dude and this meal left me so content I was forced to walk it off.   I'm already looking forward to my next visit and it's definitely sparked my interest in Slavic/Bavarian/Eastern European food."}
{"text":"Dining Experience: Dinner Specialty: Polish Menu items: Meat Pierogi, Hungarian Style Potato Pancake with goulash & to drink a Warka  Cafe Polonez is my go-to-place when in need of some comfort food. I tend to visit this cute polish venue on cold winter days. Located in the heart of the Roncesvalles area in West Toronto; Cafe Polonez opens its doors to you with warm and hearty soups, a breadth of delicious potato and meat dishes and a selection of the best imported Polish beers.  It's Friday night, after a long week of hard work, and my friends and I have decided it is time for some Polish...food I mean. As per the usual, we kick-off the night with our favourite beer, Warka (pronounced \"Varka\").  I believe the reason why I like this beer so much it's because it has a rather sweet taste to it. A medium to light beer, Warka wakens up your taste buds in preparation for what's about to come...Pierogi.  Pierogi are boiled dumplings made out of unleavened dough, traditionally stuffed with potato and cheese, sauerkraut (a.k.a cabbage) or meat.  My Pierogi are usually stuffed with pork, accompanied by a mix of fried onions and bacon and topped off with sour cream. I must clarify before we move any further, most Polish dishes come with sour cream as the side dipping sauce and everything on their menu just goes with it. Hello fatty acids, my hips have missed you!  Next up, the famous Hungarian Style Potato Pancakes with Goulash... Now, this is where I get my dose of comfort food. After indulging in a tasty drink and even tastier set of dumplings, I am ready to sink my teeth on this dish.  The Hungarian Style Potato Pancakes is a staple in Poland and a specialty at Cafe Polonez. Having traveled to Poland a few years ago, I can attest that this potato pancake is just as good as the ones you get in Poland.  The dish comes with a quite enjoyable coleslaw and boiled carrots and beets. I usually skip on the latter and just concentrate on the slaw and of course, the goulash stuffed pancake.  Buen Provecho, Viviana."}
{"text":"I have been craving schnitzel for a LONG time, so on the night of my birthday, my husband and I decided to come here. Cafe Polonez was in a great little area, with lots of nice, little shops surrounding it and High Park, of course.   The restaurant is clean and trendy looking and we took a seat, against the wall, in the back. We ordered the platter for two. Since we had never been, it felt like a good idea to try it ALL out. GREAT idea! We were delivered a platter of food that included two schnitzels, two cabbage rolls, 6 perogies and some other sides. Everything was great, but the schnitzel and cabbage rolls in particular were excellent! I ordered two gravies to go with the schnitzel, expecting two, little Swiss Chalet-sized gravies, but instead we got two, huge bowls of gravy. Needless to say, one bowl would have been more than enough for 2 people. They were only $1 apiece, so not the end of the world.   Plenty of food for two people and a great sampler platter to see what they have and what you like.  Service was fast and good and everything was excellent. Totally recommend it and I'll be back. Just thinking about it is making me salivate!"}
{"text":"Very good choice for Polish food.  I had the Bigos and Borscht and both were excellent.  Service is very good and everyone is friendly.    The menu is diverse enough to please someone who doesn't like Polish food (if that is possible) or is a vegetarian."}
{"text":"Great food. We ordered a platter for two which really can be for three people. I like the cozy feel of the cafe and service."}
{"text":"Went to sunday dinner with friends. Tried Cabbage Rolls and Polonez Schnitzel. food were bit salty, maybe u can ask them cooking without too much salt when they get order.   food were nice but server forgot our beverage. (at that time quite busy)"}
{"text":"Extremely good food. Authentically Polish and delicious. We had the perogies, schnitzel, and borsch. A mild warning that this place while not outright expensive is also not cheap. But it IS worth it."}
{"text":"Definitely lived up to its rating. Looking for something to eat on very West side of Toronto for a group of people. Cafe Polonez is the place to go.  Frequented be polish locals, get your perogies, cabbage rolls and schnitzel on!  For a group of six, we ordered the platter for four and extra cabbage rolls and potato pancakes. We we warned, it's a lot of food (in the nicest of ways), but not in a \"you can't eat all that\" kind of way. But in a \"well done, this will be enjoyable!\" Way.  Best part for me, the schnitzel dipped in the dumpling sauce. Only issue I had was I could barely tell the difference between the pork and chicken schnitzel.  The cabbage rolls, potato pancakes and sausage were all amazing. I'm not a fan of the dumplings though (not to be confused with the perogies). They are basically just dough in a great sauce.  The service was super friendly and nice. Make a reservation, it does get busy."}
{"text":"Polish Restaurant  in Toronto. Greatest and tasty one which I ever try. Food delicious and small soon goood."}
{"text":"Found this place just wandering and was very surprised. The cheddar and potato pirogies were amazing so tasty and the cabbage soup with mushroom dumplings also really good. Will definitely come back when I'm the mood for pirogies!"}
{"text":"I had the beet soup with mushroom dumplings, the schnitzel and pierogi filled with cheddar and cheese, and sauerkraut and mushrooms. Portions were huge and really tasty! Service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"I went there with my friends after visiting High park. I read  a lot reviews about this restaurant and finally made wise choices.  The staff there were all very friendly and nice. They provided some suggestions when we were confused with the menu because it's Polish style~ The food were served in large portion but the price was not expensive at all. I ordered one platter for one with pierogies,  a large size schnitzel, boiled potatoes and beets and add a mushroom cabbage roll. To my surprise, the waitress forgot my cabbage roll at first so she didn't charge me for it as an apologize. It was so nice!!!  My friends ordered potatoes pancake and polish dumplings. The portion was sooo generous and all food were in good flavor. We cannot have them all actually. I particularly love their beet soup and pickles on side-dish. The rye bread and butter were also provided free before our main dish.  The restaurant was suitable for family and friends because of its relaxed atmosphere. The food was authentic as well. If you are interested in polish cuisine, you must go to try it."}
{"text":"Best polish food, service was excellent, they even made a bit extra for us after the kitchen was officially closed. Platter for two was excellent."}
{"text":"We walked over to Cafe Polonez and had a great meal. We felt like having some comfort food to soothe our busy work week. I had to try the dill pickle soup and I'm glad. The soup had  dill pickle flavors with chunks of potatoes and sour cream. Then my better half had the Weiner schnitzel and I decided to have the Hungarian potato pancakes with goulash. Wow oh wow both plates were very filling and we're both full.  Great meal, great place to eat."}
{"text":"Every Friday, I think of going here to have the dill pickle soup. It's only offered on Friday. Whyyyyy?   I love the goulash pancake and the cabbage rolls too."}
{"text":"Portion sizes hold up to Polish standards. Excellent food, the pork pirogies and the mushroom pirogies are my favourites.   The cabbage rolls were outstanding as well- the best part is they allow all kinds of substitutions! Replace your sides to your every whim - making the menu completely customizable.  The service staff are smiling, friendly and outgoing.  Willing to guide guests to the Polish traditions.  5 stars !"}
{"text":"Awesome, authentic Polish food - great stuff. The place is usually packed but moves quickly, and the menu is pretty much everything you could want to find in terms of Polish cuisine. The staff are friendly, and if you're not familiar with the options on the menu they're happy to offer advice and suggestions."}
{"text":"The best restaurant, always fresh, tasty, great people working there. Family restaurant, I always love it there!!! This place deserves 5 stars"}
{"text":"This Roncys restaurant is well known among locals and wider, and although this is my second time here - I am still unimpressed.  Let me back that with the info that I am originally from Europe, and have eaten pretty much all national cuisines there.   This time I had the Polonez Schnitzel with some perogi on the side.  The perogies (meat) were nothing special - plenty better ones around Toronto.  The schnitzel was a disappointment - small size (not even half the plate) and very, very oily.  These are supposed to be pan-fried, not deep-fried, but this one tasted very deep-fried.  The mushrooms on top were so soaked in oil (and not extra virgin olive oil that I am used to), they were literally spurting oil when pressed.  I barely finished half the plate.  The polish dark beer was the best part of the meal.  I'm comparing this Schnitzel to the Czech place near Port Credit (the name escapes me at the moment) - and there's no comparison.  At the Czech place the schnitzel was positively HUGE, bigger than the plate (plates were same sized with Polonez), and not oily at all although still having the batter.  Last time I was here I had the paprikash and goulash and was very, very underwhelmed - they were bland and lacking that 'zing' that should give them the savory deliciousness.  It felt like I quick-cooked them at home while watching TV, instead of something cooked by a professional chef with years of experience."}
{"text":"In the middle of winter, Cafe Polonez can deliver the perfect meal to get you through yet another blistering cold or dreary wet day. Hearty thick goulash soup with tender beef is a delicious bowl of warmth for your soul. The beet root soup with little mushroom dumplings is a lighter option but just as delicious. For the mains, the hearty paprikash with a perogie upgrade will fill you up. Also, why isn't perogie upgrades a more widely available option in life? Am I the only one that feels this way?? Cabbage rolls are always good, especially smothered with tomato sauce. The sweet carrot chunks, tart cabbage slaw and beet salad sides keeps each bite interesting.   The service is quick and tries to be accommodating. Definitely get reservations if you can plan your life ahead of time, the little restaurant gets filled up quickly on cold days."}
{"text":"I should have listened to my friend and had the potato pancake filled with meat and gravy and carrots and stuff on the side because even though my pierogies were amazingly good, I kept looking longingly at his crispy-gravy-ed pancake and wondering, WHY!? WHY did I NOT GET THAT!?  And then he gave me a bite. And it was heaven. Sweet glorious crunchy gravy meaty heaven (with sour cream!)  I will be going back very very soon to get you my potato-pancake! This affair has just begun! WAIT FOR ME! (whispering)...I love you...."}
{"text":"I feel like Cafe Polonez might be one of the city's most popular unknown restaurants. It's always completely full and busy and yet it hardly seems like anyone's ever talking about it. I've been a few times and the food is always delicious, so I'll bet this'll be changing soon enough.  Anyway, this time around I ordered the Potato Pancake Hungarian Style (Potato pancake stuffed with goulash and served with side bouquet of salads). Honestly, I can't think of anything negative to say about this dish. Not the size, as it's fairly enormous. Certainly not the taste, as the goulash is just about perfect; it's rife with delectable bits of pork and a rich, delicious sauce. I could probably eat this every day for the rest of my life.  Now, the downside to Cafe Polonez and the reason I'm not giving it the full five stars is because of its atrocious service. It took around 20 minutes for a waitress to even approach our table after we had arrived and it was around an hour (!) before we even got our appetizer. My water was hardly ever refilled, and the bill took forever to arrive. I understand that the joint was completely packed and it looked like there were only two waitresses, but that just means that more wait staff should be working on days like that. No excuse for this kind of service.  I'll keep going to Cafe Polonez for the amazing food, but it's the kind of place where you have to warn newcomers not to expect competent service, unfortunately."}
{"text":"Delicious food, I had the chicken meatballs in a creamy dill sauce, my friend had the potato pancake stuffed with goulash, both were amazing. We also started with pierogies and they were great.  They were accommodating to the 2 of us and our strollers which was really nice. Gave us a table with space to tuck them beside us without being in the way."}
{"text":"Cafe Polonez is by far the best* schnitzel place I have been to. Prices might be a bit higher than others but you get what you pay for. If you are craving schnitzel look no further. The sides they serve are always excellent - I would also suggest paying the extra for the side of pierogies. *EDIT: I JUST FOUND BETTER SCHNITZEL IN TORONTO - LIBA'S BAR AND GRILL ON BROWNS LINE!"}
{"text":"Awesome place. You can tell it's a popular place when it's constantly packed! There was a line going out the door when we were leaving.   Service was fast and friendly. They gave us a basket of bread & butter to start.   I had the Cabbage Rolls (Pork) and they were absolutely delicious. The tomato sauce was sweet and tasty. I also loved the beet salad and coleslaw which came with it. My friend ordered Perogies and enjoyed them. She thought they would have come with a side or sour cream though, which they didn't.   Looking forward to trying more menu items here! Lots of street parking available on Roncy."}
{"text":"My friend JP and I, both of Filipino ancestry, are on this cultural gastronomical adventure. Today, it was suggested we try something from Poland. I invited my dear Polish, Wit, to join us, and perhaps give us some insight on the dishes from his part of the world.   In the beginning we were not quite sure where we were heading for dinner. All we knew was that the Polish community was located in Roncesvalles. We were confident we would find something special upon arrival. Wit suggested Cafe Polonez. I did not dare question his suggestion. Sometimes it's best decisions like this are left to the people from that part of the world. Right? Absolutely!   Having grown up in Edmonton and Calgary, I have been exposed to the strong Polish community in those cities. As a young boy though and a new immigrant from Asia, I was not too fond of their food. Having lived in Singapore for a number of years, my tongue was accustomed to love the spices of the East. I remembered during one of my very first potlucks in Jr. High school, one of my classmates brought some homemade Pierogi with stuffing that got my tongue all confused. Hey, I was really new to this country. I found the food rather bland that I wish I had my fish sauce and vinegar so I could dip it. The sauerkraut mushroom stuff pierogi ... I don't even want to go there. Fortunately, I was polite. I finished what I took and respected the experience. After multiple similar experiences I eventually developed a taste for Poland.   I suggested to JP and Wit,  since we were in a Polish Restaurant to try one of the dishes that probably best represents the country, the Pierogi, for an appetizer. We ordered six pieces ($6), three stuffed with cottage cheese and potato, the remaining were stuffed with sauerkraut and mushroom. This experience brought me back to my Jr. High School years, but my reaction was completely different this time around. Probably, one of the best Pierogi I have ever had. I enjoyed every bite. Bravo Cafe Polonez! I honestly could have eaten 30 of this good size Pierogi by myself.   We also ordered Zurek ($6) and Flacki ($6) soups. Zurek is a white sour based rye soup with Kielbasa and boil egg. Surprisingly delicious and hearty. I could have had the whole bowl to myself but unfortunately, I had to share with my good friends. Flaki soup is apparently a favourite amongst the Royals of Poland once upon a time. It is made with tripe and various spices.  I could have had all this soup to myself  as well and feel like a royalty. It was good!  Schnitzel Melt ($16), Herring(9), and Potato Pancakes(8) were the main dishes that we ordered.  While waiting for the food to arrive, we truly enjoy some Polish beer. We tried Zywiec (my favorite!), Warka, Tatra, and Tyskie. I am honestly not a beer person myself but I ended up enjoying it with all the food we ordered.   The first dishes that arrived was the Herring and the Potato pancakes. The herring was served with Polski Ogorski pickle, egg, some veggies, and a really yummy coleslaw. I was not a big fan the raw salted herring as I found it a little fishy but the bitterness/sweetness of the Polish beers we were drinking helped got rid of the taste. Nonetheless, we still enjoyed the experience. The potato pancakes were the best I have tasted. I actually ate it with sour cream and pieces of salted herring.   The final main dish that arrived was the Schnitzel Melt. I really enjoyed this dish but by this time, I was stuffed. I still got myself to try it though. I love the beet salad that came with it. The schnitzel was memorable. I really enjoyed the mushroom and cheese that was on top of it. I highly recommend this dish to anyone visiting this restaurant.   For dessert... Yes!!! we ordered fruit stuffed pierogi ($6). I honestly don't know how I got to eat this. I was so stuffed! Served with icing sugar and sourcream, it was enjoyable. Make room for some fruit pierogi dessert at Cafe Polonez.   Lastly, I have to commend this restaurant. It was clean, the ambiance is warm, and the service is excellent. Our Polish waiter was very knowledgeable and friendly. Thank you Cafe Polonez for a wonderful Polish gastronomical experience. We will be back! Maybe sooner than expected! I had some major Pierogi craving while writing this review."}
{"text":"I've been going to Polonez since well before Roncesvalles Village became a hipster haven, and fortunately nothing has changed (apart from the sign out front, which now reads \"Cafe Polonez\").    I have ordered the same two things for close to two decades: the potato pancake filled with beef stew, and the beetroot soup with dumplings.  The pancake is great, but the beetroot soup is truly incredible. The dumplings are deliciously tender and stuffed with a tasty chicken and pork filling that reads like a high quality pâté. The clear red broth is sweet and flavourful, the fresh dill adding another layer of divine to the lovely flavour of the beet.  And the combination of those scrumptious little dumplings saturated with the sweet broth is a truly unforgettable eating experience."}
{"text":"Happy Birthday to ME!  Friday the 13th, Good and Lucky!  My old co-worker Beata recommended I try out this Polish restaurant when I'm in Roncesvalles.  I trust her opinion because if a Polish person recommends a Polish restaurant, I am already sold!  They have the expertise of what authentically tastes good, Polish-style.  Booked a reservation for 6 earlier in the week and the person on the other line was nice and took down my information easily.  We arrived on time, 8 PM sharp on Friday night.  Coming into the place, it was a nice, polished wood setting.  I thought it was going to be a diner.  It had pictures from Poland on the walls which were fitting to the restaurant.  Our hostess guided us to our reserved table in the back, right where an old map collage of Warsaw lay hanging on the wall.  Cool!  We were recommended to try the pierogies and I was definitely feeling a tickle for schnitzel (funny, kinda rhymes).  I ended up ordering the Platter for One for $19.95 (4 pierogies - cheese & potato, Polish Schnitzel, Hunter's Stew, and instead of the bouquet of salad, got potato pancakes).  We had to wait a while for our food.  My guess was that they had to cook everything fresh, and plus, the restaurant got pretty busy as all the tables were filled.  When the food came, it was absolutely humongous!  Look at that picture!  I didn't know where to start.  Oh yea, PIEROGIES!  The taste was worth the wait.  I have not had a lot of pierogies in my life but these were soft and delicious.  Pork Schnitzel was pretty good and had a lot of mushrooms on top.  Hunter's stew had pieces of polish sausage in it.  Yum!  The Potato Pancakes were delectable.  They were a combo of pancake and hashbrowns.  MMM!  I absolutely loved the meal.  My criticisms about it was that the meal was mega OILY and the schnitzel was kinda dry.  Other than that, I blew my expectations.  The food definitely sticks to your bones!  Our server was a young gentleman who took care of us during the night.  When the restaurant closed and we were the last ones, he never came over to kick us out or tell us.  He waited til we were ready to go and cash us out.    I would definitely go there again, but not anytime soon.  I was happy with my overall experience and most definitely recommend you to check it out!"}
{"text":"What a place!!!I've had an amazing lunch today at this restaurant with my friend!! We ordered a Chicken Schnitzel melt meal it was just delicious!!!So tasty! The service was great too,the waitresses are very friendly and kind!! Highly recommond this place!!"}
{"text":"Amazing spot, nice cozy ambiance, smiling waitresses, great unique food, perfect flavors, great value! Platter for 1 or 2 are amazing combo for new clients like me, it has perogies, schnitzel, sourkraut, pickled ginger to die for, salad, mashrooms, very generous though. Definitely I will go there again."}
{"text":"Huge plates of food. The hungarian pancake - an enormous potato pancake stuffed with meat stew is good - personally I'd prefer it with goulash or something spicier because it was a little bland. The white borscht is excellent. The service was unusually slow last week - we waited 40 min for food, and it took 10 minutes for everyone at the table to get theirs. It's not usually like that. But whatever you do, don't order the duck (because they might sell out before I get mine) - the roast duck is really good and although it seems expensive, last time it was enough for 3 meals.   Definitely my favourite Polish place on Roncey."}
{"text":"A little on the pricey side but the liver hot sandwich I would come back for. Decor is romantic and service is friendly."}
{"text":"Our server was one of the friendliest servers I've ever had, and she really wanted my friend and I to have an authentic Polish dining experience - perfect! I wanted to try Polish beer, so she gave me a brief overview of the beers. After choosing Tyskie, she promptly brought the pilsner. I liked its refreshing, citrus flavour. She said it's common to mix it with raspberry syrup, and highly recommended it. Sure! So, she returned with a large syrup shot and a basket of warm rye bread. I ordered goulash with pierogi ruskie, and my friend ordered the platter for 1.   I came here last spring with a friend (visiting from Wroc?aw, Poland) for perogi take-out. Apparently, the former Polish president ate here during his Toronto visit!   Fast-forward to yesterday: the people behind us were amidst a celebration, but my friend and I had no issue hearing each other. Once served our main courses, we sampled each other's plates. I liked the Polonez schnitzel and bigos from my friend's platter. Unfortunately, the meat in my goulash became tough to chew after eating several pieces. I loved everything else on my plate though, especially the pierogi. We didn't have room for dessert, so we drank the remaining raspberry syrup that wasn't used in my Tyskie-syrup concoction. From Polish hospitality to reasonably-priced, homestyle Polish food, we left planning our next visit!"}
{"text":"I haven't had many experience when it comes to Polish food . Last year I attend the polish festival on bloor and get a general idea of what their food is like . My friend and I discover this place after we went to high park too see cherry blossom and were very happy with this family style restaurant .   We had a platter for one and add on a side cabbage roll . The portion was really generous and it's excellent for sharing , also you get a bit taste of everything. So it is like an intro for this type of food . And if you found you like sth better than the other next time you know what to go for .  Perfect for someone who can't make up their mind !    The platter we had includes choice of one kind or pierogis ,  hunter' s stew , coslaw , beets and breaded pork with sautéed mushrooms . The potato cheddar progis is very good as I could tell it's not sit there for long and reboil it , very tender with some texture to it   . But it depends my very last visit with another friend I found it's different it's more dry , so it's lack of consistency. The pork was juicy and crispy very good indeed . The hunters stew has the tangy cabbage so it cut down the richness of the sour cream and protein , and so does the sweetness from the beets .   The pierogis comes with sourcream and minced pork in the oil . I love the progis cause it remind me of Chinese dumpling in a way.  Those are the type of food in can't say no it take me back to my roots so it's hard to not like it even just a somewhat alike lol .  The cabbage roll is with tomato sauce it's more like a cold dish . Also forgot to mention they give you a basket of bread and packs of whipped butter to start ,  it's European type of sourdough bread . Overall it's great food and family style"}
{"text":"Finally got around to trying this place, not knowing what to expect.  Definitely a clean space, efficient and pleasant staff and very busy.  Great start.  Also brought over really nice bread.  We let our waitress know this was our first time there, so she recommended the platter for two which came with two cabbage rolls, 6 perogies of which we could choose two different kinds in sets of threes, two chicken schnitzel with mushrooms, beet salad, sauerkraut, vegetables, coleslaw... I think that's it.  For $39.99.  Cabbage roll was really good... coleslaw was nice and the chicken schnitzel was okay, kind of flavourless.  The perogies... were GARBAGE.  The worst I've ever had.  They came boiled which made no sense to me.  I had the cheddar/potato, my friend had the minced pork, both were awful.  The CNE is my comparison and they are WAY better than this place.    When the waitress asked how everything was I was straight with her and said the perogies were boiled which surprised me.  She replied \"oh we can fry them but you need to tell me\".  Um, no, I told you this was our first time here, so you need to tell ME there's an option.   They were really unappetizing, I'm not even sure frying them would have helped.  I personally don't like sauerkraut so it may have been great but the beet salad was not to my liking either.  Again, may have been just me.  So if this is standard Polish food, I likely won't eat Polish food again.  I felt this place was quantity over quality and in all honesty my stomach was pretty unhappy with me when I got home.    I won't go back but the cabbage rolls and coleslaw were very good."}
{"text":"good perogies order them pan fried. Simply delish! Potato and cheese perogies are the best. There plates are all very good and there side dishes are good too."}
{"text":"Delicious food, good prices, large portions, excellent service, nice ambiance,free bread. I can't think of any reason not to give Cafe Polonez 5 stars.  Surprisingly good for vegetarians too - especially the amazing beetroot soup!  FYI: The menu is longer in real life than on the website."}
{"text":"Im not Polish but I think this is the place to go for some home made comfort polish cuisine... no?  I stumbled upon this place on Saturaday night ... the area is general was dead but when you look into this place it was packed with couples and families.   I had the potato pancake stuffed with goulash... yummy?? YES!!! Omg it was sooo good though it was a nice portion I couldn't finish it, I was stuffed.  It came with salad, beets and cooked carrots.  SO GOOD! Mom and dad had that classic Schnitzel which was also good apparently.  For 3 people a beer and 1/2 litre of wine it came to about $70 which is pretty good.  I payed that at Moxies for 2 people and the food wasn't half as good as this.   Definetely a come back to place. Staff were friendly and service was fast.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Great Polish food!!!  We were very satisfied!!!  Food was very delicious and service was great very fast and super nice..!!!  I'll definitely come back when I go to visit Toronto again... I highly recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"Since my first encounter at Cafe Polonez I have been back several times. Enough that I cannot count them. I have tried most of the major items on the menu and in most cases you cannot go wrong. Recently I have fallen in love with their cabbage rolls, which are quite flavourful, and their Pulled Chicken Sandwich (with goulash gravy). It's like going to Swiss Chalet and getting the hot chicken sandwich but WAY better because of the goulash gravy and the bouquet of salads. All for 10.95!  Although if this is your first time visiting the restaurant I would recommend the Hungarian Potato Pancake stuffed with goulash, the Polonez Schnitzel, or the Cabbage Rolls. If you feel like something light, go with the Borscht (cold or hot), or the Crepes.  The only menu items I am not crazy about are the Chicken Schnitzel Sandwich (if you want a schnitzel sandwich, go to Schnitzel Queen), and the Hunter's Stew was just too much sauerkraut. Still this place is one of my favourite restaurants in the city!"}
{"text":"Solid, Polish comfort food near High Park!  I preferred the pierogies over the cabbage rolls...although I did like the side salads A LOT, re:  coleslaw, beet salad, dill potatoes.  Other veg were just awh-ight.  I'm pretty sure the pierogies were made in-house as the wrapping wasn't very thick like the ones that come from your grocer's freezer.    The only con that I can think of is that is was L-O-U-D, LOUD in there for a Friday night, early dinner service.  I couldn't hear any background music, but perhaps that would help to control the noise.  Definitely not ideal for a first-date or a catch-up meal!  Note:  Fried onion oil sauce has PORK in it, so FYI Halal/Kosher/Veg peeps."}
{"text":"I live right near this restaurant so it is convenient for me, total comfort food, I recommend the Borsch and Dumpling soup, when ordering pierogies make sure to order arrangement of different fillings so you get to try  assortment , The cabbage rolls are amazing, pricing is very reasonable and makes this restaurant I must go if you're in the Roncy's area , i've also seen this restaurants featured on the food network and it was voted Torontos  best Polish food"}
{"text":"I honestly couldn't wait to try this place out, especially that I was talking about it at work all week and after watching \"You Gotta Eat Here\" episode with John Catucci.  For one, I've never had authentic Polish food so I went with a couple of friends.  I don't normally give out 5 stars but honestly I couldn't find any fault in this place whatsoever.  Service wise, all of the waitresses were so nice and extremely attentive, especially on a Friday night where the place filled up quickly, so the atmosphere was just buzzing.  Servers were busy but not to the point where they couldn't provide friendly service whenever we had questions about certain things that were on the menu.  The atmosphere is really nice, it's a small/medium size restaurant that seats around...50-60 people?   The prices on the menu are pretty reasonable, I only ended up paying a lot because I was deadset on trying a lot of menu items, just little dishes here and there.  My friend ordered the Hunter's Stew and at $9.75, he was presented was an enormous helping of stew consisting of stewed sauerkraut, sausages and onions (for the record, that was an amazing dish).  For myself, I ordered the beet root soup with meat dumplings, 6 cottage cheese and potato pierogis and 1 cabbage roll.  It doesn't sound like a lot of food but by the end I was FULL (worse off, we ordered the dessert crepes and I could barely eat by then).  The beet root soup was simply divine.  Especially when I don't like beets, for they're earthy and honestly the colour itself doesn't appeal to me.  But it had a star on the menu, plus it was on the You Gotta Eat Here channel, so I was like...what the hey...let's try it!  I never knew that dill, beet root could pair up so well.  It was nothing like what I've had before (except the dumplings look like large tortellinis).  I found myself devouring that bowl reaaaallly quickly.  Pierogis were SO GOOD. I liked that the place offered two ways of cooking it, boiled (traditional), or pan fried.  I chose to have mine pan fried and as mentioned, absolutely delicious.  I also loved that they were hand made since the pierogis were not completely the same shape and I could clearly see indentations, indicating that they were wrapped by someone.  They were incredibly light, especially with the cottage cheese in it and so fluffy.    Finally, that cabbage roll.  I can't tell you how pretty it was.  When I cut into the cabbage roll, the meat inside was so packed in.  Normally when I eat cabbage rolls, they kind of fall apart on me and the cabbage literally disintegrates on me.  But this one was packed like a dense meatloaf and was so moist and juicy.  Plus the sweet tomato suace on top of it just set it over the edge.    I could go on and on about how good this place is but I'd bore you guys with paragraphs of hyperboles.  This place is a must go, I promise you that it's yummy food from beginning to the end."}
{"text":"Delicious intro to Polish cuisine. We got the dinner for 2 with pierogies, cabbage rolls, schnitzel and salads. It was all perfect. No room for the soups or else we would've tried them. Nice atmosphere too -- not overly fancy, clean and looks recently redecorated."}
{"text":"Has to be the best place we ate in (near) Toronto in our two week stay.   We got a giant platter of food and scarfed it down as best we could. Growing up in Chicago (little Warsaw) it's hard to find good (or any) Polish food anywhere outside of Chicago.  Cafe Polonez was great!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a place showing the fight (maidana/mayweather) and stumbled into cafe polonez. Boy was I surprised, between the fun regulars to a collage of urban youth it was a fun yet oddly familiar spot in Toronto. The place is clean, with ample seating for 40-60 depending on the patio and despite only a few people working behind the counter, service is pretty good.  The Perogies and strudel really do stand out here. Just so traditional, but well executed. The fries and sandwiches are alright, but kind of plain, so don't waste time on them. Get the classics, bring some friends and have some fun  Recommendations -Perogies -Strudel"}
{"text":"Great food and excellent service!  We were in just before closing to grab a bite after reading about it on yelp.  Everything that was positive about this restaurant was true.    We had the cabbage rolls and schnitzel entrées and they were excellent.  The price was just right for these two dishes.   The service was great. They were always at our service. Kept our glasses of water filled so you know that they were always ready to serve.   I'll be going back next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"legit maybe the best actual food i've ever had in a restaurant -- if not, at the very least, the best i've had in toronto. i like to pamper myself with a trendy, fancy dinner experience, sure, but the home-cooked goodness this place serves up trounces that fine dining shit any day of the week. pretty no frills environment, & the service -- courtesy of an older polish woman with broken english -- was curt & friendly. hey, i'm italian, & this place just defines \"HOMEY\" to me."}
{"text":"Awesome service.  Our waitress was very nice.    Food is good and authentic.  Portions are big too.  Great prices.    Got the schnitzel combo and the Hungarian pancake goulash dish"}
{"text":"I am on the schnitzel hunt!  The place was packed, but yet the service was fast and friendly. The waitresses made it look like there was no struggle and kept smiles in their faces the whole night.   The food, was fantastic. For appetizers, we started with the pierogis, which were probably the best I've ever had. I got a schnitzel melt, with cheese and fried mushrooms along side with pickled, cabbage and coleslaw, which was amazing. The schnitzel was a decent side and nicely breaded and crispy. The portion sizes were huge and for an incredible price.   I strongly recommend you pay a visit here for either lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I had heard great things about Café Polonez, and being a lover of pierogis and schnitzels, it was a no-brainer whether to make a reservation with them or not. I gave them a call before the Christmas holidays and requested a reservation for 16 people. I was shocked by how easy it was to make a reservation since reviewers often mention the huge wait-times and long lines.  I really enjoyed my meal; great portions, tender schnitzel, decent prices and great service. The one thing I did not really care for were the pierogis. I am not a huge fan of boiled pierogis, and if I do eat them boiled, I like to add salt and eat them with sour cream and feta. But what are the chances that a Polish restaurant will have feta? Not likely.  Looking at these pictures has me eager to pay them another visit. ASAP!"}
{"text":"Great food for affordable prices. Everything was fresh and so delicious! Fantastic service and a really clean place. 5/5"}
{"text":"So here's the deal. If you're hungry and want a generic but diverse menu of Eastern European food that will not disappoint, you go to this place.  Don't know what to get the first time? Simple! Make sure you come hungry and get their combo plate. It will give you a good idea of what you can choose from the next time you come back.  From their pierogi menu, go with pork and sauerkraut + mushroom (they let you do half/half combos).  The staff is genuinely warm and welcoming. No fake smiles or attitude here.  Don't be fooled by the simple and cheap setting, the food is delicious beyond words."}
{"text":"This is my first time being here, And I love it. The food is excellent and the service is great. The atmosphere is casual and a great place for good food and conversation nice and relaxing place, very busy place so you know it is goodwill definitely be back here again"}
{"text":"Dropped in recently for lunch and had a terrific beet soup with mushroom dumplings (also available with meat dumplings). I wish I'd been hungrier--people around me were eating platefuls of delicious looking food. Atmosphere is casual, friendly."}
{"text":"Will come again. Cabbage Roll and Potato Pancake certain doesn't disappoint! Want to try other items on the menu later."}
{"text":"Never had polish food before but it ended up pretty positive and quite filling.   Never heard of their homemade kompot drink was awesome. It is some sort of sweet berry juice with some berries. Ended up ordering two.  Food wise we had the Platter for one which had a very nice light breaded schnitzel 4 perogies and 4 different salad things. also something else which I forgot. Then we had 2 cabbage rolls. There was a lot of filling food so only thing is there was too much food. Other than that it was good. Good service too and very comforting atmosphere.  Self seating it seems as we waited by the door :)"}
{"text":"Had lunch here today and I'm totally sold.  Six lunches plus five beers and the total of our bill was only $126!  That's pretty awesome!  I ordered the Polish Bouquet salad and the potato pancakes.  Both were good.  I sampled one of the perogies and it was delicious!  Everyone was more than satisfied with what they ordered and the portion sizes were more than ample.  My fellow Yelpers were right on the money with this place.  Totally enjoyable!"}
{"text":"This is our go-to place for perogies! The service is usually a bit on the slow side, but the beef goulash and cheddar cheese perogies make it totally worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I had the best chicken schnitzel in my life. It was around $15, but it was worth it. The atmosphere of Eastern European hospitality truly resembles a typical Polish cafe with a wide selection of comfort food, which feels home-made. The staff is nice and courteous, and the washrooms are clean. The cleanliness of washrooms is an indicator of the way a venue treats its customers. We ordered 2 schnitzels and 2 Polish beers and the total bill worked out to $50+tips."}
{"text":"Two guests at 6:30 pm on a Friday night.  Service:  Alright, it was a busy Friday night after all. We got attention when ordering our authentic Polish beers. The menu was very helpful for non-Polish patrons!  Food:  Perogies - good, but I wish they came pan fried without asking...especially since we didn't realise we had to. We tried the 2 each of the vegetarian options (they let you mix and match!) and they were all pretty yummy.  Potato Pancakes Hungarian Style - After hearing such great things about this dish I thought it would be phenomenal. It wasn't. I have a feeling it had to do with the fact that it was served room temperature, when maybe it should've been served much, much warmer. I took most of it home and after a good zap in the microwave it did taste pretty good.  The portions ARE huge and the salads are pretty good. I'm not sure if I'll come back on a Friday night for any of the entrees, but I will be back for the comfort of the damn fine perogies. Also, I think this restaurant should forego the complimentary bread basket, it's just such a waste when your portions are so huge!"}
{"text":"To be in business this long in a city with ever increasing rent and envelop pushing culinary boundaries, keeping it simple and authentic has so much more meaning"}
{"text":"Absolutely best place to get authentic Polish food in Toronto. I've been going here since I was a child and they're still going strong. Pierogis are homemade and filling, cabbage rolls are hearty and flavourful, their Zurek is sour and bold. My all time favourite dish has to be their Kopytka. The gravy on top of these potato dumplings is out of this world. The meat in the sauce melts in your mouth. It also comes with some traditional polish sides like sweet fried cabbage or shredded cooked beets. Also don't forgot to try their compote or apple crumble as a sweet ending to your meal!"}
{"text":"Good call Anthony Bourdain....This place is pretty far from our hotel, but glad we took the opportunity to visit. We started with this dumpling that comes with sour cream and ground chix ....it was very tasty.  We also ordered a tripe soup ...yes they do put a lot of tripes, but it's probably something we will skip next time. We also ordered the pancake with goulash filling and roasted pork loin....Both were good."}
{"text":"WHAT DA FAAAAAAAAAA this place is da baaaaaaist. Never gave a shit about a cabbage roll until I hate here last Wednesday now I can't stop thinking about them and it's interfering with my work and school."}
{"text":"Their perogies and cabbage rolls are my favourite!  So glad I found this place! The restaurant had a comfortable vibe and it was a nice place for groups and families to eat and catch up.  I'm not usually around that neck of the woods but they have definitely gave me a good impression on polish food!  Service was great and the restaurant just felt like one big family."}
{"text":"Tasty and filling Polish food! I love the platter for 2 - it can easily fill 2 hungry people with some leftovers for the next day! Also, their borsht is amazing, and get it with some dumplings and you will be in heaven."}
{"text":"We arrived here after a stroll in Roncesvalles. They seemed at full capacity but the hospitable staff found us a seat promptly. We jumped at the chance to have some Polish beer. I opted for one that seemed easiest to pronounce.   I ordered the Polonez Schnitzel with pierogi. The oversized plate was laden a massive schnitzel topped with fried mushroom and 'salad bouquet' consisting of shredded beets, coleslaw and fried cabbage. The pork was thin, tender and nicely seasoned. The only thing I thought it needed was some sort of sauce or gravy but I suppose it's not typically eaten that way. The cheddar and potato pierogi were soft heavenly treats. The fried cabbage was amazing. It was sort of like Bigos or hunter's stew.      This is a great place to get a homey and hearty meal. I would definitely be making frequent trips here if I lived in the neighbourhood. Be mindful of the gigantic portions!"}
{"text":"I don't know what Polish food is but I know this place is delicious. Walking into the restaurant I was expecting a local mom & pop shop, but the restaurant was more spacious, clean and modern. Tables were already filling up at 5:30 on a Sat evening.  The mains come in a big portion and you will not leave unsatisfied. The Potato Pancake Hungarian Style is a must-try, it was very unexpected and just delicious! The dumplings were good and a fair size. The Schnitzel was alright, on the oily side, I wouldn't necessarily recommend."}
{"text":"Cafe Polonez proved me wrong, cabbage rolls were delicious and is no longer a term I use to insult people. Never thought that fried cabbage could be so good, never liked vegetables so much .  Not knowing anything about what Polish food is except for the perogies I buy at the frozen section of Costco Cafe Polonez has expanded my horizons. We tried the platter for 2 and every thing we got was delicious.    I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch and ordered the Platter for 2 which included 2 large pieces of breaded schnitzel ( choice between pork & chicken- we chose pork), 2 cabbage rolls (delicious, may have enjoyed it more with a more generous serving of the sauce), 6 pierogies (we did half veal, half cheddar/cheese- both great! ), salad bouquet (especially loved the beet salad, so good!). Everything came on a giant platter, and was the perfect amount for 2 hungry people. Modern and comfortable interior. We brought our newborn in a stroller and they were very accommodating giving us a quieter table at the back. The only negative was that I felt that the prices were a bit expensive. The platter was good but I wouldn't say it was good value."}
{"text":"I stopped going after I received cold cabbage rolls twice in a row.  otherwise I did enjoy the food. too bad."}
{"text":"Come to mama!  This place has authentic Polish food. Well priced and delicious.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Word has gotten around that Café Polonez serves the best polish food in the GTA. Since I had never actually tried polish cuisine (frozen Walmart perogies aren't really counted), I wanted my first try to be from the best. So we drove all the way to Toronto just for dinner to this place. To find a parking was difficult, since there's only street parking available, but we luckily found one not too far away. We arrived just in time. A few minutes later and we would have not got any table. The restaurant is casual, but for some reason I felt obligated to behave like its a high end place. The server immediately served us a bread basket with 4 slices of bread (i assume was rye), which honestly wasn't very good and tasted stale. All the servers were ladies, and ours was friendly despite not really smiling much.  I decided to get the cabbage roll and asked to substitute the potatoes for the mushroom and sauerkraut perogies. This substitution did come with an additional cost but I was determined to try authentic perogies. My brother got the potato pancakes with a side of mushroom perogies. The food was served within 10ish minutes and my platter looked amazing. My first bite was of the cabbage roll, which was stuffed with rice and pork. It was extremely delicious and left me speechless. The side vegetables (sauerkraut, beets, carrots) were delicious too. The perogies were boiled and not fried unless you ask. They were served with a side of sour cream and fried onions. They were good, but nothing amazing, which is just my personal preference and has nothing to do with the restaurants recipe. My brother enjoyed his pancakes. I was intrigued by the beet soup, which I'll definitely order next time. But...wow, I really enjoyed my meal. By the end I was completely satisfied by the portion size, as I was not too full and had enough room for dessert, which I already decided was saved for Ed's ice cream next door. What sets this place apart from every other polish restaurant I've noticed around is that they make their food fresh to order, while majority of the other ones have those trays at the counter with pre-made meals already ready to serve. The restaurant was on the pricey side, but I think it was well worth it. Since this experience, I've been craving for that meal almost everyday. I'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"This place loses a star because the service is not great. But then again, what else can you expect from Eastern Europeans? (I'm Polish - I can say it). Whenever I've been here the place has been bustling with hungry pierogi eaters. It really is a great place to eat - the best in the neighbourhood. The food isn't too expensive, but it's just so damn good and the portions are big. You'll love anything your try, but I recommend the \"dill soup\" because it's the greatest soup you'll ever eat and it's super polish. Made with pickles, most Canadians give me a nasty look when I tell them this soup exists, but then they try it and fall in love. Obviously you can't go wrong with the pierogi or cabbage rolls or white borsch. REALLY, ORDER EVERYTHING ON THE MENU, INCLUDING THE POLISH BEER. YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT. I recommend making a reservation on weekends."}
{"text":"Unbelievable polish food!   WOW!!!  I took home some cabbage rolls.   Both the original  (pork stuffed)  AND the mushroom cabbage rolls.   Each with its own sauce, tomato for the regular,  mushroom sauce with loads of shrooms for the mushroom rolls.   Just unbelievable!     I will definitely be back to eat in and try the pancake stuffed with goulash!   And the schnitzel.... And of course the Pierogies!   I can't wait!"}
{"text":"Awesome traditional Polish food in a small cafe tucked inside a Jewish neighborhood in Toronto. Zyweic, Tyskie and Warkha on the menu. Heavy and colorful portions which include cabbage, lettuce and carrots on the side. The potato pancake is good, nothing great."}
{"text":"Food was okay.  Service wasn't good. Location is okay.  We tried meet pirogies my daughter ate only the dough cause pork was of the lowest quality."}
{"text":"The perogies were so good. I had the mushroom and sauerkraut and the cheddar and potatoes. The goulash was warm and hearty.   The food was filling, the atmosphere was relaxing, and the waitresses were nice and attentive. I'll definitely come back to try more of the food!!"}
{"text":"I was super excited to try out this place with my closest friend who is also Polish.  He loves this place and I can see why.  I had their borsht--which was incredible.  It wasn't heavy or too sour, the flavouring of the beets was spot on.   I am super picky when it comes to how the borsht should taste because I eat it frequently at home--but I would 100% recommend it to anyone who is a fan or is curious about trying some.  The food actually tastes home-made and you can tell its made with love.  I did not find myself having to add too much salt or other flavourings because it was just that good.  I also had the potato pancake Hungarian style.  I am usually not a major fan of meats in general but I knew this was a staple dish and I was curious to try it out.  I genuinely enjoyed it especially with the small variety of salads it came with.  It is a huge portion though so be warned!  They also serve bread before the meal it was a bit stale--but thats usually the case at most places anyway.  I definitely recommend this place to anyone who loves eastern European dishes. I would give it five stars but I think the pricing is a bit on the higher end compared to other places that serve similar style foods."}
{"text":"Love the place , amazing good and atmosphere . Been coming here for years and never had a bad plate , and always tons of food on the plate , they don't cut on their portions and the food is always tasty. You will come out full and satisfied guaranteed"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of east European cuisine and have tried quite most of them in the city. I've read great review for this place and finally went to check it out. It is quite cozy inside and very spacious. The food was fresh and came with great portion at reasonable price. I ordered the Saturday special which was  schnitzel dinner with the cauliflower soup.My husband ordered the sausage and he also enjoyed it too.   I don't go to this neighborhood very often. I think it is a great spot for a date. I wish it is closer to my house and I could go back sometimes soon."}
{"text":"An amazing variety of great food at reasonable prices awaits!  The waitresses here are always friendly as well.  You can't go wrong with Cafe Polonez!"}
{"text":"Come here on an empty stomach. This place will leave you in a food coma. The polish platter for one can easily feed two people. Loved the schnitzel can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Is there anything better than good pierogis slathered in sour cream? These pockets of comfort can cure anything.   Café Polonez brings the delicious heat with all of its goodness, especially schnitzel, but to me, this place is all about the pierogis. Imagine my delight when I was feeling blue and I realized they are on DoorDash and I could use an app to have them delivered to my couch. I am still high on sour cream, and I wouldn't have it any other way..."}
{"text":"Ok this was my introduction to authentic Polish cuisine. The beetroot soup is perfect. The polish sausage is quite possibly the best sausage I've ever eaten and I don't tend to enjoy sausage. The perogies are different from the Americanized version I'm used to, but very very good. Since my first visit a month ago, I've continually craved the soup and sausage so I'm back today to satiate that."}
{"text":"After travelling to Poland recently this summer, my boyfriend and I were craving Polish food. Being in such a diverse city with many food options, I was glad we made our way down to Cafe Polonez for dinner on a Saturday night. When we arrived, the place was packed with customers and the servers were constantly busy trying to take orders and to serve food. We had to wait about 5-10 min for a table which wasn't bad. All throughout the meal I saw lines form near the door. However, people were seated quickly as customers ate and left quickly.  For dinner we both ordered the white borscht to share as well as a side of pierogies (cheddar and potato filling) and we both got our own schnitzels. The food definitely brought us back to Poland where we had tried zurek for the first time. Delicious soup great for a chilly night. The pierogies and schnitzels were also spot on. We wanted to eat so many other things on the menu but couldn't! Definitely need to come back to Cafe Polonez for more Polish food, definitely authentic!"}
{"text":"Reminds me of my Baba's cooking on the farm in Manitoba - lots of warm fuzzies! Service is awesome, all the food was excellent and tasted so homemade! Small town hospitality in the city"}
