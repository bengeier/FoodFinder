{"text":"Very nice physical space when I walked in. The employees did their job, but didn't impress me beyond that. The food was very average and could have been much better."}
{"text":"We just moved from CA and have tried so many BBQ places since moving and The Q Shack is by FAR the best we have had!  We tried the ribs, brisket and pulled pork... Ribs were amazing, pork and brisket were also excellent.  For sides we did the Brunswick stew, beans, cole slaw, and Mac n cheese.  Everything was really good.  Who could forget banana pudding for dessert?! The staff was also super patient as we asked about different menu options. Very friendly!  Such great food, we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Was great!!!  I had the 3 meat plate.  Pork Butt, Smoked Chicken and Smoked Beef Sausage.  Yum, Yum and YUM.  Go Steelers!!!"}
{"text":"Just blah.  Hush puppies and turkey were good.  Otherwise the kids pushed around their mac and cheese and the pork was dry.  They have a big sign advertising brunswick stew.  It should say brunswick soup.   People talk about the sauces.  The sauces are flavored (badly) water, no texture, and add nothing.  Small portion sizes for the price.  Overall just mediocre.  First and last visit."}
{"text":"Awful experience. I bit into a huge bone in my pulled pork sandwich. I told a staff member whose response was \"I have never heard that happening here. The butcher must have cut into a bone and didnt take it out. \". Thats it. No other response. The mac and cheese was bland and the baked beans tasted like they came out of can. To top it of we had used a coupon for buy one sandwich get one free. We ordered meals that included a side and drink. In order to get the one sandwich free, they rang up the other sandwich, two sides and two drinks a la carte. By doing it this way we literally saved nothing by using the coupon. We will NEVER eat here again. There are way better options for bbq in this area...places that actually smoke their meat in-house. Bye bye Q Shack. Forever."}
{"text":"I want to like this place, I really do.  I can't get over 3 things:  1)  Their bbq is just OK.  Sauces are good (at least 4 stars), but the meat, by itself, just isn't that great.  Their sides are just OK, too.  Mashed sweet potatoes, potato salad, barbequed pinto beans, etc.....  just average.  Not really much flavor to anything I've ever had there (roughly 4-5 experiences).  Even their sweet tea is just OK - not bad, but not memorable in any way.  2)  Their prices are much higher than their competition.  If I'm going to pay this much, I want to eat Midwood Smokehouse or Mac's.  3)  It drives me nuts when restaurants weigh out portion sizes.  Especially BBQ joints.  Feels like I'm in a Subway.  I understand it's part of their business model to control portion sizes, but c'mon man!?!?!

Service is great.  The guys behind the counter are always helpful, fast, and fun to engage in conversation, but the food is average at best."}
{"text":"I have been going to the Q for a long time now.  We usually go for their South Carolina style BBQ on the weekends.  If you don't like pulled pork try the brisket, its fantastic.  

Service is great and its simply a great place to eat if you want good food fast."}
{"text":"Pretty decent barbecue for the price.  It is a quick in and out, the sweet mashed potatoes were good.  I'd take a pass on the beef sausage, but other than that the meat was good.  If you're looking for a quick meal, it sure beats McDonald's."}
{"text":"Great deal on the family meal for $25. A ton of meat, and the sauce options were good."}
{"text":"Not impressed with the BBQ. Been there 3 times and the food was inconsistent. Was not impressed with the meat."}
{"text":"This place rocks - great BBQ! Went there many times since they've opened a few years ago and had everything from pulled pork sandwiches, beef brisket to smoked chicken. Their hushpuppies are the best around and they make their own bbq sauce (I like their \"My Sauce\" which is tomato-based). I also picked up their tailgating plate a few times for the game, always too much too eat even with 10 people. Last Thanksgiving I ordered their smoked turkey and not only did it make the Thanksgiving preparation much easier but also it got rave reviews from the whole (extended) family. Q-Shack - keep smokin'!"}
{"text":"We went here on Saturday for lunch. We're not really in this area that often but when we are we like to stop by and get their BBQ. I've lived all over the country and my family finally settled in NC about 12 years ago. Since we've been here I've missed any form of tomato based BBQ sauce. I never got adjusted to NC bbq eastern or western, it's nice to have a place where I can find an alternative NC sauces. 

The hush-puppies here are delicious!"}
{"text":"Great hush puppies
Great BBQ
Friendly service
Clean"}
{"text":"I can't say I'm an authority on BBQ, but the ribs here are nothing short of stellar. I just got the 1/2 rack of ribs, and 6 huge, tasty, fall-off-the-bone ribs showed up. With sides of potato salad and collards - it made an amazing meal. 

While I tried and tried, I couldn't quite finish the ribs (yay leftovers!) - but I'm definitely left much more than satisfied. Anytime I come to Charlotte from now on - this is the place I will look forward to (previously on the list were Sticky Fingers and 521 BBQ)."}
{"text":"Really good smoked turkey. Hush puppies are good also. Side dishes need some work. Chipolte blue cheese dressing for their salads is exceptional. All in all, not bad."}
{"text":"Overpriced and food is not good/the smell is not good like lard frying some sort of oil used.
Portions are small
Would not go back again."}
{"text":"Three stars for food. Four stars for service. 

The brisket was very good. Their tomato based sauce was excellent. 

The letdown of the meal was undoubtedly the sides. Everything was so bland. The potato salad and beans, in particular, were quite bad.  The Mac and cheese and okra didn't fare much better.  Fries were okay. The hush puppies were my favorite side. 

The service was so great though!  Quick, helpful and friendly. And for two kids and one adult, I spent less than $20, which I consider to be a good deal. 

For quick serve BBQ, I much prefer Dickey's in Ballantyne. But, The Q Shack beats them on service."}
{"text":"The Q Shack is really quite good. The meat is awesome, the staff is very friendly, and the location is super clean. I love how they cover different regions of BBQ with their vinegar and sweet sauces. Their specials are totally a good value. This place is located in a sort of food desert which makes it even more special. The area is host to a various who's who of corporate chains, The Q shack is owned and managed by two dudes who are college pals. Their information states they can cater for up to 5000 people!"}
{"text":"Sorry for not posting a pic... I just couldn't stop eating the ribs!! So I've been on a NC BBQ trail for a moment in search of good ribs and today I found them. I like a good smoked rib with such good flavor that the sauce is optional. The Q Shack has them. 

I'm kind of a BBQ snob so I asked to see the ribs before I committed. A soon as he brought them out (which was really nice of him) I ordered a whole slab. The meat just fell off the bone and they were not fatty just like I like em. They have a sweet and vinegar sauce, I don't tend to like a vinegar based sauce but it was really really good.

Here's a tip - order greens as a side and pour a little of the vinegar sauce in. Nummy num. 

I only gave 4 stars because I also order a 1/2 pound of brisket.. It was a little on the dry side but the flavor was good. I also ordered the Mac and cheese for my mom - she didn't like it. 

Winners are the Ribs, Collards and the Banana Pudding. Put that on your plate and you'll be satisfied. I'll go back to try the links and Brunswick stew. Stay tuned for the results."}
{"text":"Not as good as it was in the past.  Customer service was a 1.  We were asking for more to add to our order and they were pushing us to the cash register, when there was only two people in line.  The mac and cheese was terrible.  No cheese at all. Just butter and noodles.  I will not come back, there are better options for bbq."}
{"text":"Smoked meat is not bbq!  In NC, if it ain't pork it's not bbq.  Granted I know that Charlotte isn't really NC or in the South culturally.  I had the Boston Butt sandwich.  It was really nothing special, and I could make it myself.  The meal was $10 for a sandwich side and tea, so I think that's a little pricey for the quality.  The side (mashed sweet potatoes) were ok, and the hush puppies were also okay.  I may go back to try some other items on the menu, but over all I just wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"Great food, cute place and very nice owner!  We brought some out of town guests here and were not disappointed....we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Happy to have tried out The Q Shack. Very friendly and helpful staff!  Great tasting pulled pork.  Plan on visiting again!!"}
{"text":"Great, delicious food, but for the money, I want to leave a BBQ place feeling like I just ate a horse... Portions a little too small..."}
{"text":"Quick and great service, above average food.

Not quite the 'good' BBQ you can get in Texas or elsewhere in NC, but pretty darn close. If you're nearby and in mood for some bbq, then give it a shot.

The jalapeno deviled eggs aren't all that. That maybe the 'Indian' (Asian) in me talking, but I found it bland and too cold."}
{"text":"Pork BBQ sandwich was very good.  Two available sauces at the table, one vinegar based, one saucy...both were good.  Beer on the menu to include some local NoDa options.  Service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Hello Charlotte Yelpers.  I'm in town visiting my sister and I want to try some Q. This place is  just down the street from her house so it seems to be a good place to start. It was a mixed bag but mostly pretty good. I had the pulled pork sandwich and mom had the pulled chicken. The pulled pork was ok but the chicken was  excellent. They offer two sauces, vinegar based and tomato based. Neither is stellar but they're not bad and compliment the meat well. We got our food to go and, in a nice touch, they pack the meat separate from the bread when you get a sandwich so it's not a soggy mess when you get it home.  As for sides the mac and cheese is REALLY good and flavorful, we both agreed that the potato salad was kind of plain. The baked beans were flavorful but one of the main flavors seems to be tomato and I'm not a big tomato fan but that's just me.  The hush puppies are very good as are the onion rings.They also do catering and offer their meats by the pound so if you like it you can get a pile of it. I was driving so I didn't partake but they have a nice selection of local handcrafted beers. The prices were, in my opinion, a little on the expensive side for what you get but not outrageous. If I could I'd probably give them 3.5 stars but I'll round it up. If you're in this area and feel like some decent Q I'd say check  them out."}
{"text":"I am not a huge fan, but every now and then,  David wants to grab a bite of BBQ and the Q Shack is convienently located.  The service is pretty quick and the food is a-ok.  I get the smoked turkey.  The mac-n-cheese is not great, but I've had worse."}
{"text":"This one great place to eat BBQ!!! Really, my only complaints are they do not have chopped NC BBQ and the meat portions are too small for the price! Other than that, it's really good. Don't get me wrong, I like pulled pork too, but I just prefer chopped BBQ.  The meat is really tender and the sides tasted so good especially the cole slaw. 
   The next best thing are the prices! most BBQ joints in the Charlotte area try to get whole paycheck when you come eat there, but the Q Shack has affordable prices. They also have lunch specials, which are an even better deal. I can actually stop in for lunch, have great BBQ, some fries and a drink for way less than 10 dollars, which seem to be the going rate at other BBQ eats in the area. 10 dollars is just way to much for a working man's lunch, to me! 
  The owner is way cool as well. He has the inside done up with all kinds of sports teams, but he himself is a HUGE Steelers fan. I can deal with that. He will talk sports and BBQ with ya all you want and I can talk them there subjects all day long. I urge to givew them try so we don't lose the cheapest, GOOD BBQ in town. the owner say his ribs are spectactular so needless to say I will be grazin' on them bad boys in the very near future.
  I want to end this review by saying to all the BBQ purists out there like me that crave some CHOPPED BBQ, PLEASE try 521 BBQ. Justr head out 521 until you see the Sun City retirement complex and they're about 2 or 3 miles on the left past that. I'm a tellin' ya'll's, that's some damn good BBQ! It's a little expensive, but it' is off the chain. It's easily, from the about 25 BBQ restaurants I have tried in the Charlotte area, the best and reminds me of my beloved Wilbur's and such in eastern NC."}
{"text":"Quick work lunch and wanted to try something new.  I am not a huge BBQ fan but my coworker is moving back up north and needs his BBQ fix before he leaves the good ole south!  I really enjoyed the food at Q Shack I had a salad special (I know what your thinking you ordered a salad at a BBQ restaurant) don't judge me it came with pulled pork and pulled chicken and was quite delicious and the three hush puppies that ended up on my plate were a great surprise.  I tried the chipotle BBQ sauce which was very tasty as well as their spicy blue cheese dressing.  And I must admit the Pittsburgh paraphernalia already had me liking this place go Pens!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the service here is phenomenal. Every time we go in we are so taken care of! I work in the same plaza as q shack, and every time the owner passes by he waves and occasionally checks on us at night. 
Secondly but not far being is the food! It is sooo full of flavor, and everything I have ordered has been perfect. I could eat their Mac and cheese for breakfast lunch and dinner"}
{"text":"First time having The Q-Shack!!! I have a great appreciation for a welcoming presence when I walk through the door. The guy at the order counter was very helpful. Being that this was my first visit I appreciated him offering suggestions especially on the side items. I order the pulled pork BBQ sandwich with slaw (my love for Eastern style North Carolina BBQ wouldn't have it any other way) with a side of collard greens. I like that he asked if I wanted my BBQ shredded or chopped. I chose shredded. You already know my drink was the sweet tea with lemon to top it off!!! I sat down and the first thing that I tasted were the hushpuppies. They can only be decribed in 2 words \"Super Amazing\".  I can't remember anyone's hushpuppies being this good. I am not usually fond of cornbread / hushpuppies but these will definitely make you rethink how you feel. The BBQ sandwich was very tasty. This is very good coming from someone who prefers eastern style vinegar base BBQ with the flavor already mixed in the meat. This pulled pork was very flavorful and the sauce both the NC Vinegar and the Texas Chipotle were very good. My only real suggestion that I would make is that I'd the bun for my sandwich had been steamed this meal would have been 5 stars for sure!!! I really didn't expect to be wowed by the collard greens but they were flavorful and good too. I definitely plan on making a return visit."}
{"text":"Overall decent.  Don't eat pork, but usually get the chicken salad or turkey plate.  Good..kids like the pork."}
{"text":"The only barbecue place I like in Charlotte. Love the pulled chicken sandwich. Plus they have a great assortment of sides."}
{"text":"I guess I am going to be the problem child in what appears to be quite a few good reviews.  

After recently moving right next to Promenade, I needed a break from unpacking boxes, so my parents swung by to check the new digs out and I took them to lunch.  BBQ sounded good to everyone and after eating at The Q Shack quite a while ago (years...?), I thought I had enjoyed it.  Either I was really hungry that day, or there have been some changes since the last time I visited.

Located at Promenade at Providence, this restaurant has a prime corner space at the end of one of the buildings.  There is parking directly in front and at 12:45 on a Friday, there were plenty of places to park.

We all ordered the hickory smoked pork butt - me and mom got platters that come with 2 sides, dad got a sammich.  The trays were whisked down the line and quickly assembled.  Dad ordered fries with his sandwich and was told they would be brought to the table as they were being freshly made.  The breakdown:

Smoked pork butt:  The meat is too spicy/vinegary.  I like plain to mildly seasoned meat that I can then add sauce to - I want to be able to taste the smokiness of the meat, not vinegar and spicy pickle juice.  I was also with my late-60's parents who don't like spicy foods (but they are both sports, so they trudged on since I paid for lunch).  The sauces were both pretty thin, more spice and I wasn't impressed with either.  The meat was tender and well cooked though.
Mac and cheese:  Peppery, not cheesy.  Bad.  
Cole slaw:  So DRY!  Was there even any dressing in it?  It honestly tasted like the bag of ready-made cole slaw you can find in the HT produce section that they waved a mayonnaise jar over without actually putting any in.  Slaw mix was fresh, but way too dry.
Fries:  Like a blind date from my matchdotcom days - limp and greasy.  They appeared to be fresh cut, but again, just not good.
Hush puppies - AWESOME!  The only part of the meal that I enjoyed. 

They had banana pudding as a dessert, but after nothing in the meal tasted good to me, I dared not try it.  

For the 3 of us to eat, with drinks, was $30, which for lunch was reasonable, but the only thing that I actually enjoyed were the hush puppies."}
{"text":"It is hard not to like this impeccable, owner occupied little BBQ joint in south Charlotte. The Q itself is excellently smoked and served sauce-free allowing you the freedom to add your own at your table - whether it be the vinegary eastern NC or the tomato-based western NC variety. Both are made in-house and are superb. Meat choices include pulled pork and chicken, beef brisket, pork ribs, smoked turkey and sausage. Never been disappointed with any.

Just as special are the choices of house-made sides including collards, mac n cheese, mashed sweet potatoes, pasta salad, jalapeno deviled eggs, side salads, fries and, of course, pork n beans. Last, but not least, are the addictive dessert-like hush puppies included with all meals. Pricewise everything is very affordable. You very conveniently order, pay and receive at counter and fill your own fountain drinks. 

I have been a regular for 10 years. The owner Dave is passionate about his restaurant and is behind the counter most of the time (and the consistent high quality of the food and cleanliness of the facility reflect it). Definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"Great BBQ, good selection, and average prices. Not bad. The reason for 4 stars, is while in line to place my order, someone (I think it was the owner) was very rude to his staff. He must have corrected them 10 times, and the guys working were not doing anything wrong. I felt bad for the employees."}
{"text":"I really like the ribs here.  I don't think I've ever had the pulled pork, but the ribs are huge and seriously meaty.  There have been times when I've ordered 1/2 rack and can't finish them.  Hush puppies are good, mac & cheese and cole slaw are solid.  The price is so reasonable.  If you find yourself in the area you really can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"The best bbq around. Friendly staff. Clean. And just perfect! I will eat here everytime I'm in this area!! Good job guys!!!!"}
{"text":"BBQ Sauces are what I enjoyed most!  The Sauces are close to 4 yelp stars

One of the three \"linemen\" wanted to be helpful and was very patient while his co-workers were interrupting as if there others behind me waiting... Guess they are trained herders which is OK with me... This level of Service is OK.... I give the Service 4 stars for Entertaining Borderline Rudeness, it is entertaining enough for 4 stars or close enough

How was the food?  3 stars or less! Wish I were eating Korean!  Ready, Steady GO: 

Pulled Pork good flavor, just no better than \"good\" 3 stars 
Beef Sausage 2.76 stars
Brunswick Stew 2.45 stars
Beef Brisket 1.73 stars

Extras not counted : 
Collard Greens 2.72 stars
Hush Puppies 3 stars

The Dude mostly taking my order should be working in a MUCH Higher Scale Restaurant!!!  Your efforts are appreciated and if the manager says hurry the customers, remember One Day you will get to work in an Industry where your Talents are VALUED! !! !!!"}
{"text":"Lunch this past Saturday. For me the best pulled pork in the area. That with a side salad and their homemade ranch dressing is my half hearted attempt at a healthy lunch. The hush puppies were done perfectly."}
{"text":"I've been a consistent customer of the Q since they opened. But, it wasn't until this week that I finally tried their brisket and sausages. Both were very good. The brisket was very moist, had a great crust and was tender to the bite. The sausages were smoked, juicy and had a lot of flavor. 

The Q staff has always been very friendly and accommodating. While it's a franchise, the guys put their own spin on the bbq and deliver a high quality meal every time."}
{"text":"They have a phenomenal sliced brisket sandwich. Also, their mac n cheese is very good and they have great ribs. Pricing on most menu items seems fair considering the quality."}
{"text":"I like this little place.  I've been here twice now and have gotten the brisket plate/sandwich both times.  It's very good!  They have a larger selection of sides, that usually has me waiting just in front of the counter trying to figure out what to order.  Fried okra was my choice last night - crispy and fried just right so that you don't hate yourself after.  Haha.  The food all seems very fresh, the staff is very friendly and helpful.  Dine in, eat outside, or take it home! Perfect for a quick, cheap, solid dinner choice."}
{"text":"I ordered a tailgate special for a Christmas party on a Monday night. The ordering process was fast and easy and the price was great. When I went to pick up the order the employee who assisted me was excellent. He was friendly and showed me everything on the order and even carried it to my car! The food was good, I'm obsessed with the hush puppies. We had tons of leftovers and would definitely recommend the tailgate special for any catering needs."}
{"text":"Love the sausage! That is my favorite here; best meat they have. Ribs are very good, pork is average. Turkey is also very good. Sides are good here, the deviled eggs you must try."}
{"text":"I'll work from the standpoint that I am a tough grader and therefore an \"A\" (aka, 5 stars) is very difficult to get.

However, this is a uniformly good restaurant. My wife and I have eaten there numerous times, and between us we've had just about everything on the menu.

Pulled pork sandwiches are excellent, but the brisket is also very good (especially the brisket sandwich), the \"Cobb Salad\" variation is wonderful, the ribs are great. I don't think the prices are outrageous, the staff is personable and quick (say hi to Tony) and the entire meal takes as long as you wish to linger, not as long as they take to serve you.

Good sides, free hushpuppies and a blues playlist on the speakers to add just the right touch of ambience.

Stop reading this and go."}
{"text":"This place is..... ok considering how commercial they are . Not sure if all the food is tasted while cooking or after so it just seemed a little 'off\" Its in a \"High End\" location so you pay more just because, of were it is. If it was 1 mile down the road it would be about half price.I had a wide selection and some seemed to be brought in from a food truck or at least the taste was that.
                    Not sure but...... if I had a BBQ joint  I would  have something always smoking they do not. If nothing else make smoked chicken wings or chicken its cheap plus the smell brings people in . Hey how about Bologna Smoked ? Look you have lemons make Lemon aid. And veg smoke peppers onions Yummm have a smoked pizza?Anyway that's my story and I am sticking with it"}
{"text":"I was here Sunday for a quick bite.  Had the BBQ sandwich and jalepeno deviled eggs and potato salad.  Great BBQ (mustard based) for kind of a fast-food type place.  LOVE the 35 cent deviled eggs!  Clean place with quick service - I recommend this place!"}
{"text":"My favorite BBQ place.  They never disappoint!  And try the different sides, excellent choices and always good with or without the great BBQ.  My person fav: Pulled Pork, with a baby slaw fried okra and the perfect, fresh made, hush puppies.  This BBQ is so good, you don't need sauce."}
{"text":"Just moved here from Chicago. Full disclosure, I'm a Boilermaker and Dan is too. That being said I'm fair when it comes to food.

Dan and crew are super friendly and I felt overwhelmed with a sense of belonging as soon as we started dialogue.

Had the perfectly cooked brisket on TX toast with a side of creamy coleslaw, awesome hush puppies/corn fritters, a taste of the delicious Brunswick stew and a KILLER banana pudding. 

I prefer a rub with a noticeable crunch on it but Dan lets the meat speak for itself and I respect that. He pairs them with sauces that compliment the meat and takes me to my happy place (including a chipotle bleu cheese sauce I may just bathe in one day). I also added a little of the bbq sauce to the stew because I like it with a bit more tang. Monster!

All in all, I have found my spot in Charlotte.

BOILER UP!!"}
{"text":"While visiting some friends we got to try a nice variety of meats from here. The ribs were my favorite. Pork was decent and smoked turkey as well. Overall, just about everything we tried had a nice smokey flavor and was cooked just to our liking.

I'm not from North Carolina, so I can't really compare this place to any other local Charlotte BBQ joints.  However, I can say I would definitely go back for the ribs."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised to find there is a Q Shack in Charlotte since it was always one of my favorite places in Durham.  After this visit, I'll probably go back since it's got lots of nostalgia for me (and is close to work).

But seriously- 3 hushpuppies!!!???!!!??  Three.  One.  Two.  Three.  Not four.  One less.  Three.  Definitely not five.  More like three.  And while we're on the topic of me stuffing my face with way more atherosclerotic foods than I should, the brisket portion was a little skimpy.

Someone should go visit the original location and take notes.  Eating at this place was like Q Shack that was left in the dryer too long."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty diversion for you BBQ delinquents.  This ain't quite Texas BBQ, but it's doggone close.  As long as you give this lively gentleman a choice of tomato-base sauce, I'm all right.

Beef brisket sandwich was on point. Fried okra was crispy.  The hush puppies were tender.

My only complaint: with all the sports memorabilia plastered on the walls, you'd think they'd put a TV or two in here.

That is all."}
{"text":"Good food and great service. The fried okra was amazing.  The BBQ was good but not anything I'd go out of my way to get. Would definitely come back if I'm near by."}
{"text":"Just ate here for lunch great service but the food was a little rough sides tasted a couple days old and the BBQ was dry the brisket was juicy but tasted like nothing but fat $30 for food we picked at we left hungry"}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a while, but dropped by today to pick up the pulled chicken for dinner at home. Ended up adding a pint of collards and couldn't pass on the jalapeño deviled eggs. Everyone enjoyed the meal, the chicken tasted amazing without any bbq sauce at all. Collards were a little on the spicy side with a good amount of bacon in them. I will definitely be dropping by there more often."}
{"text":"Awesome, awesome, awesome ribs and banana pudding.  The rest of the BBQ is also very good, but very good is common in Charlotte when it comes to pulled pork BBQ.  Their ribs, however are a rarity and worth the trip. They are also priced pretty much in line with other higher end BBQ places in charlotte.  I bring out of town guests here, but steer them to the ribs."}
{"text":"I had an hankering (wha???) for some BBQ but my usual haunts were all closed. So I could either delay my desires (which I would rather never do) or try the only BBQ place I could find open: The Q-Shack.  

My first visit may not have been a good representation of what they had to offer. It was just before closing time and everything had that \"leftovers\" feel: just tired of being hot food.  Still I had the brisket, took it to go and enjoyed it at home.  It was a far cry from the brisket I was dreaming of from Uncle Billy's in Austin Tx but it was better than any brisket I was eating currently.

This week I went back and ordered the brisket with pasta salad and mac and cheese (yeah a lot of noodles). This time, the brisket was better but the pasta salad still had that store-brought taste.  

Don't get the wrong: the food isn't bad at all but the price leaves me wishing the sides were on par with the meat.  

In my local ranking of BBQ, Q-shack is a solid 4th place."}
{"text":"The ribs and pulled pork were delicious closest I've had to my grandad's pork bbq. The ribs were juicy and fell off the bone. Wasn't crazy about the mac n cheese but I will definitely go back there."}
{"text":"You really can't miss this locally owned BBQ Joint. They carry everything from the Beef brisket, Ribs, homemade Mac & Cheese to Beef sausage. All the sides are great and the Slaw is outstanding, ok I'm picky about my Slaw. We are up in the University and drive down for the food every other week. 

I also bought one of their Turkeys for thanksgiving and it was so good I had them cater a golf outing this past spring. People came up to me saying it was some of the best BBQ they have ever had, period.

Check it out and if you have an event Dave was more than willing to make everything go off without a hitch. Thanks Again."}
{"text":"This has to be the worst food I've eaten in a while! The BBQ chicken was extremely dry & bland. The side I chose was Mac& cheese since everyone raved about it and it was gross!!! It looked like wet noodles and tasted like noodles tossed with oil. There was no flavor in the mac at all. I also had the potato salad which needed the most improvement! It was soooo bland!! The best part of the food were the free hush puppies!  They actually had some flavor! The people are extremely friendly (that's  the 2 stars) the food however, is no stars! I would not recommend."}
{"text":"As BBQ is almost a Religion in the South here is a declaration of where I stand: 

Now I have to say that I LOVE Barbecue, I have eaten Barbecue all over North Carolina (Eastern and Western), Georgia, Florida, Tennessee (Memphis), and Texas. Now I know this may hurt some feelings but North Carolina Whole Hog Style Chopped BBQ w/either Tomato Based, or Vinegar based sauce's are on the BOTTOM of my list. Memphis style Baby Back Ribs are hard to beat, and well as Texas Beef Brisket, and Sausage putting them at the TOP. BBQ is serious business in the South. So now you know where I stand.

Now on to the review: 

This is another one of my favorite BBQ restaurants in Charlotte. They have GREAT sliced or chopped brisket, chicken,pork and personal favorite is the Texas Style Smoke Sausage. They have a tomato based, and vinegar based sauce. My personal preference is the tomato based. 

In my book where The Q Shack sets itself apart are the variety of made to order and fresh sides, They have Potato Salad, Pasta Salad, Coleslaw, BBQ Beans, Mac & Cheese, Fries, Onion rings, Hushpuppies, Fried Okra, Collards. I LOVE the Collards at Q Shack. Making GREAT Collards are a dying art in the South. These folks have nailed it. The Fried Okra is just like what my Mother used to make when I was growing up in Florida. The Macaroni & Cheese is killer too. And OMG, don't go to the Q-Shack without ordering one, or two of their Jalapeño Deviled Eggs. 

And if you want dessert, I would get the WORLD CLASS Banana Pudding. 

I would highly recommend Q-Shack if you are a True BBQ Fan, or just like Good Food."}
{"text":"Simple yet satisfied. Always enjoy their food and service. We have been a couple times and it was one of our top favorite BBQ joints."}
{"text":"Hello Friends, 

I stopped by here after the family pictures around the corner. At 4:15PM i was the only person there. GREAT (I think). The prices are reasonable with enough decent options.

I had the 2 Meat Combo for $12.49
Mac & Cheese (Meh)
BBQ Beans (ok)
Brisket (Under Meh)
Pulled Pork (what's ever under \"Under Meh\")

Both had a decent amount of smoke flavor and thats about it. No salt or rub or any seasoning. I know some places do different things under different philosphy. Some don't want to take away from the meat so they don't add too much seasoning. (if that's their philosophy, they hit it on the head.) While other places add salt, and different seasons to compliment the meat. I will go somewhere else that has the philosophy of the latter. 

Ending on a more positive note. The place was clean and that's a plus.

{"text":"The staff is wonderful and great service (reason for one star)  , BUT the food is very bland and has no taste to it at all ! I love BBQ food , but thier food taste like nothing ! Also thier portions are super small ! Don't go in there if your starving ! It was honestly a waste of money !"}
{"text":"Barry is Awesome! Employees are friendly. 
I Love this restaurant! 
Best BBQ I've found since moving here and sides are Great, very unique style!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today. Had pulled pork, mac & cheese, and coleslaw. It was OK. Nothing spectacular. The guys behind the counter were very friendly though."}
{"text":"Thought I would stop by this BBQ place and I'm happy I did! I ordered their pulled pork sandwich special served with hush puppies and a side, I chose the Brunswick stew as my side. The server/counter salesman greeted me at the door and was extremely helpful almost as if they knew i was coming. The sandwich has a lot of pulled pork piled high and has a good smoky flavor that's not over powering and served on perfect bread that's the quality or better of a bakery style bread. The guy at the counter also recommended I try a new BBQ sauce called rasberry BBQ. WOW I love the rasberry BBQ and Its not just rasberry and BBQ sauce mixed together but rather a hint of rasberry that compliments the sandwich. The sandwich was so good but equalled the taste of the Brunswick stew. I could come in here and just order the stew with hush puppies because it could be a meal by itself. The taste of the of Brunswick stew was very rich and I enjoyed dipping part of my sandwich bread and hushpuppies in it. DEFINATELY would recommend this BBQ place. I was lucky enough to meet the owner and discovered why his staff is so nice because the owner has excellent customer service. He made sure I was a happy customer and offered me a sample of their delicious Brisket. The atmosphere is incredibly warm, clean, inviting and I would feel comfortable bringing my friends and my family here. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"}
{"text":"Nice...
I've eaten at several Q Shack's around NC and this one lives up to the reputation.  

I had pulled pork...always good. The sauce has a little kick to it so don't get caught off guard. Depending upon your \"spicy/hot\" tolerance (mine is really low) taste test it first but for me it is great. Love it, will be back for more."}
{"text":"This place has some great BBQ. The guys there are always nice and the good is reliably good. My only complaint is I feel the portions are a little small for the price."}
{"text":"Came here to check out the food as we are considering using them to cater an event. We tried (and liked) everything. Brisket, pulled chicken were juicy and tender. Mac & cheese was gooey and smokey. Jalapeño deviled eggs were delicious with a kick. I liked the potato salad because it wasn't potatoes swimming in mayonnaise. Fried okra was frozen, but very good. The hush puppies are very nice...not too dry and a little sweet. Banana pudding was good...not the best I've had, but good. We ate here on a Sunday afternoon right at 12:00. They stayed moderately busy the whole time, but there were plenty of tables open, so this seems like it would be a good place for after church lunch."}
{"text":"Lots of vegetarian choices. I like picking up dinner from here. Food is consistent. Good food for a good price. Midwood is better but this is half the price. Workers are extremely nice."}
{"text":"This franchised location of a Triangle staple is quickly becoming one of our go-to options in the South Charlotte / East Ballantyne / Providence neck of the woods. In fact, this barbecue joint, along with the Total Wine, Yoforia and Home Depot located nearby, is quickly making the Promenade on Providence a frequent midweek stop for our family. 

First, this place fully plays to my Pittsburgh bias, so let's get that out of the way. The owner is originally from Western Pennsylvania but has been in Charlotte over 15 years, and the guy's certainly learned more than his fair share about barbecue and the delicious sides to go with it. A few small pieces of Pittsburgh sports memorabilia on the walls let you know you've found a place that embraces the black and gold, but none of the decor gets in the way of the real showpiece here: the food. 

My wife and I have enjoyed every meal we've had here, including the entrees - pulled pork sandwich, mustard pork sandwich, brisket, and smoked turkey - and the sides (sandwiches come with one, platters come with two) - collards, mac n cheese, baked beans - and hushpuppies (a few are included with every meal). They offer three different sauces, too, to apply according to your taste. There's a vinegar-base, a tomato-base, and a mustard-base that's tweaked just enough to be different from the Carolina mustard sauce you may be used to. 

Tea and soft drinks are your only beverage options; that, combined with a newer, more commercial location, give The Q Shack a much different feel than my other two BBQ favorites in Charlotte: Mac's Speed Shop and Sauceman's. It's a perfect place to bring our son for a quick, early evening out and it can also be especially affordable if you're a daily special kind of person. 

In addition to an already fairly-priced menu, this location has a $4.95 special all day every day, and sometimes it has two. The last time we visited, for example, they had a salad topped with egg, BBQ chicken, and pulled pork as one selection and another featuring a sandwich filled with their pulled pork soaked in mustard sauce. And if the kids are coming along, Wednesday is Kids Eat for $1 Day (w/ purchase of a regular meal, natch). 

So, if you're in the Promenade area and want a reliable spot for lunch or dinner that offers good taste, variety and value, give The Q Shack a try."}
{"text":"Average BBQ food with great service.  They had some nice Carolina style BBQ sauce which had vinegar in it.  That was the best part of the pulled pork that I had.  Fries had nice seasoning to them and hushpuppies were typical.  If I am in the area again I would visit this place over typical fast food chains, but only if I was in the area.  I wouldn't go out of my way to visit this place again."}
{"text":"Great food. Extremely fast service. Good value. What more could you ask for?

Been back 3-4 times since. Outstanding everytime. And FAST!!!!"}
{"text":"I really like this place for their fresh sides. Their mac and cheese is really good. The fried okra is served up fresh. My wife goes for the veggie plate. I like the BBQ chicken. Very tender. I also like the brisket. Not many places in NC you can get that. Medium price, but worth it."}
{"text":"Great food the smoked sausage is awesome"}
