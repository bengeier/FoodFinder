{"text":"Great local restaurant! Very good food and the service was fantastic. We will be coming here again!"}
{"text":"Just a great spot! The inside seating is quite cozy, though we usually go for their ever expanding outdoor seating area (dog friendly!)  They have a GREAT beer selection at fair but not super cheap prices. Love having this place in the area."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and both times were great. Wonderful atmosphere, yummy food and the service is friendly. I will be back!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are foodies...we go out to eat nearly every day, so when we happen upon a restaurant that has a little extra oomph, is when I am inspired to write a review. I had the spare ribs for my entree. The meat literally fell off of the bone. Our starter was a shared caprese salad, with homemade mozzarella, fresh basil and a sliced beefsteak tomato drizzled with oil and balsamic vinegar. It was so refreshing that I would have been fine eating that as my entree! My only beef I have with Oven and Vine, at least for lunch, is that every entree on the menu, with the exception of the spare ribs, is spicy, and I don't like to feel like my mouth is burning when I eat! But that's just me. I know that in this part of the country most people love spicy food! But it does not keep me from going back regularly! I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday last week. It was fantastic.  Atmosphere was very relaxed and service was excellent.  Would definitely like to come back and check out the patio area sometime. ( We sat inside.)  The converted house definitely lends itself to a feeling of laid-back coziness.    For dinner we started with the burrata. The cheese was delicious and well seasoned and the homemade bread was amazing - warm, crusty and coated in olive oil and rosemary.   Next we had the garden salad, which was  a little plain.  Though the greens and tomatoes were nice and fresh,  we  didn't receive any cucumbers.  Luckily the parmesan, pepper corn dressing rescued the dish with some excellent flavors.   For the main course my girlfriend and I split the green chili pork with potatoes au gratin.  The chili was as good as anything I've had in new Mexico but the real standout were  the potatoes.  Thinly sliced and layered with cheese and cream they're almost like a pavre.  They were excellent by themselves and even better paired with the chili.   To drink my girlfriend had a glass of pinot grigio while I had the funkwerks saison.  There were plenty more choices for wine and beer and it seemed like they had a full bar.  Definitely something  for everyone here.  I'll see what photos I have and upload them along with this review. Definitely pleased with my experience.  I'd recommend Oven+Vine to anyone looking for a casual meal.  I'll be back to try out the Flatbread  eventually!"}
{"text":"Fantastic!!! Cute place with great food, fabulous wine, and awesome service. I asked our server to choose my dinner for me, and he did not disappoint. We will be back here, for sure!!"}
{"text":"Good food, great location the outdoor space was perfectly pleasant.  Just go and have a relax meal."}
{"text":"Relaxed, great wine, take your time, great food. Sit outside in the grass and let Ronnie help you pick a great wine. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"While this cozy, cool little place has only been open for a few months, they seem to be off to a great start. I tried the Veggie Sandwich and it was quite tasty! The bread is all homemade and they have a good selection of beers as well. The menu offers some great choices for both vegetarians and meat-eaters alike, and it was easy to quickly determine which items were vegetarian, vegan and/or gluten-free. Our server (a young lady named Claire) was very friendly and informative about the menu and the establishment itself. Nice place all around. I'm looking forward to coming back and sampling more items from the great menu."}
{"text":"Amazing place. The outdoor area is my favorite. Cool and hip, lots of outdoor sitting plus you can take your dog with you! There is a small lawn/game area and the entire place is just lovely. Service is good, the owner actually serves us on many nights. Great flatbreads (pizzas), good sandwiches and great pasta! Plus they have lots of beers on tap. Perfect!"}
{"text":"Oven + Vine was the sweet ending to our adventure. We sat at the service bar and so glad we did.  We met so many nice people and had great food and drinks.  We ordered the cheese and meat platter, the olive appetizer and a flatbread pizza. Everything was fantastic!  The owners, Michelle and Dylan, were super friendly and helpful. They even helped us with directions to the airport. We will definitely stop by again on our next trip to Phoenix!"}
{"text":"I was excited that a new place opened up so close to my condo- I can walk there! I had the grilled veggie salad with chicken. The chicken was delicious- moist and slow cooked. The amount of food was much more than I would have expected as the prices are low. My husband had the pizza and loved it!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, small and intimate with indoor and outdoor seating. A little chilly last night outside, but totally worth going in. Food and service was superb. Nice wine selection.....chocolate torte is a bit of heaven on earth (if you love chocolate)!"}
{"text":"Still 5. Feels like home. Also, bacontarian sandwich. Get it. Top 5 sandwich of my life."}
{"text":"I will be surprised if this place makes it. For starters,  the entrance is poorly delinated/ lit.  I arrived 10 minutes after my six friends, who had already ordered. The red headed waitress showed up 15 minutes after my arrival, and asked if I wanted anything to eat. I mentioned that first I would like a glass of water, and she responded that she had brought 7 glasses of water to the table. My friends scrambled to find the extra untouched, lukewarm glass of water,and I ordered my food. My friends meals arrived, and as they were finishing my 4 pre cut ribs and a 3\"x3\" square of au gratins was served. The ribs were dry and undercooked.  The waitresses never came back, so I was unable to ask for some barbecue sauce. She did eventually show up to give everyone their bills, including mine while I was still eating. She never asked if anyone wanted anything else. What a waste of time and money."}
{"text":"My 3rd time visiting Oven+Vine when in Phoenix and it never fails to disappoint. The food is fantastic and I really enjoy their unusual wine selections. The outdoor space is unique. I'll definitely continue to come back!"}
{"text":"A GREAT LOCAL JOINT.  GOOD FOOD, SERVICE AND ATMOSPHERE.  Nice atmosphere.  Great cold beer on tap.  The Earl pizza / flatbread was good to above average.  The green Chile with pork and jalapenos plus au gratin potatoes was well above average.  The seasoning was perfect to my taste.  This is a great local neighborhood hangout.  I definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Oven and Vine is a treasure.  Once you find it you will always return.  The food, wine, service, and comfort are over the top.  Enjoy!!!!"}
{"text":"A nice, quaint restaurant.  We stopped by for lunch.  They have your standard, what I would call \"trendy\" American food.  This consists of sandwiches, flatbread, salads, and a smattering of hot entrees.  The sandwiches are good with fresh ingredients.  We also had the green chili pork.  We were surprised to see that this was more of a stew rather than a dry dish.  It was pretty good, though a tinge of sweet flavor slightly detracted from what I consider to be a savory dish.  The cheese/meat plates are a tasty treat.  The seating area is small.  Wasn't too crowded during our lunch hour, though I can imagine it might be full for dinner.  The small size also makes the ambience loud if other tables are having heated conversations.  Might not be good for an early date place.  Price is on the higher end, though the downtown location sometimes makes this inevitable."}
{"text":"This place is heaven in a corner! Love the food. I do take out, it's a short walk away from my work. The  Bacontarian was bacon lovers delight! Also tried Italian sandwich it was perfect with kettle chips. I love this little place so glad your in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Cool place. Impressed with it all. Good food, good selection of draft beer. Cool music, nice ambiance. Went for dinner with my wife and 1 year old son. Surprised for such a cool downtown place to see high chairs and an outdoor grass area for my son to play in. They had the outdoor beanbag toss games on the lawn and he had a great time even though I'm sure mostly adults play.  Staff friendly and helpful. We will be going back."}
{"text":"Really good food! Greeni chicken is super. Service a bit slow for my taste, but then again I was myself"}
{"text":"Just opened up - super warm, cozy place.  Great ambience and look forward to taking advantage of the inside/outside bar when the weather gets better. Plus the Guinness is on tap!  The food is delicious and a bargain.  Prices and portions are great for lunch prices (super affordable) or a light dinner or a heavy dinner where you might want to try a few different things.  I had the baked manicotti with sausage and my wife had rigatoni with sausage.  We enjoyed our meal and look forward to trying a few more dishes soon!  Only thing that was foreign was that you have to pay for warm bread.  Will definitely be back...with friends!"}
{"text":"Great spot! Very unique, a ton of beer on tap. Food was phenomenal, a must.  Service was great, very helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"Nice area. Food was really good, had the BBQ pork ribs. Okay beer selection. Good service. Not much else to ask for."}
{"text":"I have reviewed this place before but thought it was time to give another shout out as its SO one of my favorite urban core places!  Went last night with a group of friends (partly due to the email I received about the salmon special).  Two of our group ordered the salmon special and it was just as delicious as I anticipated it would be.  Our roasted veggie appetizers were excellent, the wine and beer were great and Austin is our FAVORITE waiter!  So attentive and what a memory!  He took all six orders without writing them down and they all came out perfect!  And did I mention the bread?  I usually buy a loaf to take home with me and enjoy it for a few days!  Trust me, you will love this neighborly place and will want to return time after time as me and my friends do!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious however nothing about the food wowed us! Don't get me wrong the food and service was great but I can't say I would die for their food. I plan on visiting again soon to try other menu items and explore more of their flavors!"}
{"text":"I live nearby and this place is a true blessing to the neighborhood.  Delicious food.  A casual but festive environment. The perfect location for a very tasty meal.  The wine list is great and so are the extensive beers on tap.    Really lucky to see this restaurant open.  The food is delicious.  You'll have a great experience."}
{"text":"Great place after heard museum to recharge for more fun in phoenix.  Very friendly and knowledgeable"}
{"text":"Great food and happy hour specials! Monday through Friday, 11am -6pm specials on wine and beer. I always get the flatbread pizzas and coke for lunch-- the best sauce in town. This place is great for private meetings and meeting up with colleagues while downtown! One if Phoenix's best kept secrets!"}
{"text":"The food and service is excellent here. We came here based on other yelper's reviews. Great little find!  Bonus: They have a cute lawn where you can play bags and sip your wine. Feels like being in someone's backyard. Perfect now that the weather is letting up!"}
{"text":"An awesome little restaurant. I had the braised beef which is perfect. Got the au gratin potatoes (delicious) and it came with bread (buttered, sliced, fresh rosemary and sea salt!!) Selected the \"Stand Out\" wine - lovely. I arrived early and they graciously allowed me to plug in and write a report as I whiled away the hours. Can I say, the music was also very fun?! Loved this place!"}
{"text":"Met friends here after work. Don't blink or you'll miss it. It's a small narrow space inside which wasn't much of an issue. I didn't feel it was inviting nor did I feel relaxed and comfortable, partly because of the person who waited on us, didn't seem all that friendly. I just wanted to finish my glass of wine and leave. The place looked clean and there was an outdoor area. I'm all for giving it another try. I don't believe one uncomfortable experience will deter me from trying it again."}
{"text":"Relied on yelp and found this wonderful place for lunch - a little hard to find but it was fantastic- very fresh and lovely service!"}
{"text":"Went here for wine, didn't order any food but I loved the place. My friends did order the vegetables and potatoes as appetizers which they said were ok. They have outdoor/indoor seating  and the service was good. I'm excited to go back and try the food!"}
{"text":"Too bad the first impression of this place is the short haired platinum blonde lady. I think her name is Claire.  She was very rude.  We walked in and requested a table for our group.  It was a Saturday night; they don't take reservation, so it was very busy.  We agreed to put our name down and wait for 1 hour.  We found a couple of counter stools available, however, Claire in a rude tone, told us that we couldn't sit there because it's for dine in.  She then told us we needed to move and wait against the wall on the sidewalk or pointed to an area by the tree.  It was because of this rude tone that we walked out and went to another restaurant nearby.  No one from our group is ever going back to this place!!  Very disappointing.  P.S.  Reading the Yelp comments here, it looks like Claire was also rude to other Yelpers."}
{"text":"First, I have to say that I'm really mad that I moved around the corner from here three months ago, go to rollover donuts regularly, and still didn't go to oven + vine until tonight. I'm just so mad that good food has been this close to me and I didn't know it. Ok. On to the review of this fantastic spot.   We brought my parents who were visiting from out of town to check out a local spot. The ambience is casual and laid back without trying to feel too hip or snooty - it feels like it's a part of the neighborhood. We grabbed a spot at the middle table and our waiter Austin came to grab our drink and appetizer orders. We ordered the roasted mushrooms and buffaletta. The mushrooms were roasted in garlic oil and topped with shaved Parmesan, served with the best bread I've ever had at a restaurant. They came out piping hot and they were fantastic! The buffaletta was creamy and drizzled with olive oil and balsamic vinegar - it's my favorite cheese, and they did it justice.   My husband and I each got a flatbread. I got the Margherita and added prosciutto. Their marinara sauce is divine. The crust, better than anything else that tries to call itself a \"flatbread.\" Bubbly, crispy, chewy perfection topped with fresh mozzarella and basil. My husband got the Earl and while I didn't try it, he certainly loved it.   My parents both got the green chile chicken. I have to say this - my mom is really picky. She is an amazing cook and doesn't like to go out to eat much and doesn't want to waste her time or money on something she could make at home. My mom took one bite of the green chile chicken and a huge grin came across her face. Then she started dancing in her seat. It is that good, guys. So tender and juicy and spicy and delicious. She got a side of the au gratin potatoes and they were so creamy and struck the perfect balance between savory, salty and just a hint of lactic sweetness. My dad finished his bowl and had a side of the roasted seasonal vegetables that looked awesome. Mom had enough left over that she's going to put it on toast with a sunny side up egg tomorrow morning (I can't wait).   We capped the night off with the chocolate torte and a scoop of gelato to split between the four of us. The torte was so perfectly dense and rich, and the tartness of the raspberry compote that came on the plate paired with the torte so well.   I have no complaints. Fantastic atmosphere, great service and delicious food. I can't wait to bring my friends the next time for drinks, appetizers and that amazing torte!"}
{"text":"Vegetarian lasagna for the win here at Oven + Vine!! I'm not even vegetarian or anything I don't know what got into me??  As a \"neighbor\" of this tucked away spot, I am happy to report friendly service and delicious food.  My table ordered the charcuterie which looked awesome.  I was on day 5 of my veggie kick and this lasagna did not let me down.  Layers of yummy veggies (squash carrots onions...) in-between pasta ribbons with delicious homemade marinara. Fresh Parmesan slices atop make this a big win in my book.  It may have been the 3 glasses of cab sav? Or the yummy fresh buttery bread??  All I know is that we had a lovely Friday family dinner that left us lingering with conversation until closing time.  We never felt rushed and always had drinks."}
{"text":"So, after watching South Park this week, I feel oddly \"dirty\" writing a review...especially my first...but I digress...Amazing brunch...eggs on the flatbread or in the green chili and the French toast (without the egg on top naturally)?!?  If only it were Sunday brunch every day...seriously though, the staff is great (they can make or break a meal) and so is the food.  And dinner?  I usually have a favorite meal at a restaurant and I become a creature of habit ordering the same thing over and over...but I actually rotate through the different meals here - you can't go wrong.  And the beer and wine selection is great too. Don't go with a big group - just a couple of close friends or family and enjoy..."}
{"text":"GREAT food , great Beers selection great waiter (Reed )  they did not have mixers for the mixed drinks  , Really? On a Saturday and on a 3 day weekend ? How does that happen ? DO NOT pay with cash ! They do not pay you back the change you are owed ! There is NOTHING posted anywhere in the restaurant and we were told when one of our friends asked about the .80 change she was owed, we were told by the waiter that they don't provide change ! WHAAAAT ?? Yes we can afford food and drinks, it's just the point no change ? Is that legal ? We will be calling the better Business Bureau on Tuesday to find out if this lawful ."}
{"text":"Ronnie took care of us at the bar, where we had some fine Terrapura Pinot with chicken lasagna and short ribs with au gratin potatoes, all of which were awesome!"}
{"text":"Pretty great food for the price. Seating was cramped but the outside patio was nice."}
{"text":"My colleagues and I descended en masse on the restaurant after a long day at a conference on Saturday. Overall, the service was pleasant and the food was yummy!  It took a long time for the wait staff to get our drink orders, and then an even longer time to get our food orders, but once we settled in they took good care of us. I can't really blame them too much for the delay as there were 20 of us, and since they don't take reservations and we arrived in the middle of a bustling happy hour, it took us awhile to find enough seating spread across multiple tables. Still, it would've been nice if they'd taken our drink orders right away so that we could have something to nurse while we waited for our food.  In any case, our server was very attentive, friendly, and couldn't have been more helpful.   We ordered a wide selection of appetizers and entrees, although quite a few of us stuck to salads since we had had plenty to eat at the conference. I had the charcuterie, opting for the Manchego, Fontina and the Prosciutto Rustico, which also came with a small bowl of smoked almonds. It was a lovely, delicate dish, perfectly proportioned for those seeking a light but filling meal. My colleague who ordered the Ashland Salad raved about it as well.   We finished up by splitting Claire's Chocolate Torte, a luscious dessert fit for two hungry diners or even 3-4 light eaters. Not too sweet, not too rich, so a fitting end to a delicious meal."}
{"text":"I like this place for its' location and ambiance. The staff has always been very friendly and knowledgeable and the food has always been above average. Just about my only complaint is their \"seat yourself\" policy, which can create a bad experience if you are with a large party or if the place is crowded.    Overall I would recommend this place, nice beer selection and solid food with great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Nice small downtown eatery. Great happy hours prices! Their bread is the best, pasta was also pretty good. Wonderful atmosphere. Grabbed lunch here midweek, only one other table besides ours. Would definitely reconsider next time downtown again."}
{"text":"Oven and Vine was awesome! A great experience from the start to the finish. I knew that Dylan and Michelle had opened a new restaurant (they used to have Portlands, a place that I dearly loved) but I was not sure where it was located. I was so excited when some friends of mine took me to Oven and Vine this week and it was their new place.  I had the green chili pork, it was amazing!! Our server was very attentive, friendly and prompt. Food was not only great, but hot and attractive presentation. I will most definately be returning to Oven and Vine!"}
{"text":"Very nice place. The good was wonderful and they had a great selection of beers and probably wine. I hope we have a chance to eat there again next time we are in Phoenix."}
{"text":"We used to eat at Portlands, and we where thrilled to find them here, we meet a friend for lunch and had a great time.  The food was on point, and the atmosphere was very comfortable.  Can't wait to get back."}
{"text":"Such a cute place that is so well hidden! I went for happy hour with some friends and enjoyed a nice glass of red wine. I ordered the roasted veggies, which were a bit bland. I should have ordered the flatbread, which is what others around us were ordering and it smelled and looked amazing. I will definitely return and try the flatbread!   They have corn hole & giant jenga in the outdoor patio. Seating is first come first serve, but we were able to find seating for our small group. Wouldn't recommend it if you have a larger party, since it is a smaller restaurant with tables for 2 or 4. Excellent service & very speedy!"}
{"text":"Only stopped by for a quick bite to eat, however, was very impressed! Great atmosphere as we walked in. Quick and prompt service once we sat down. We decided to order the Green Chili Pork and the Prosciutto Pesto Flatbread. Meals came with their homemade bread. Everything we ordered was absolutely delicious, although pork was a little spicer than expected. 4 start due to not knowing anything about their drinks or happy hour. Would love to go back and try it again!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the Caprese salad and sausage/mushroom flatbread last evening. Plenty of delicious food.   The wine selection is also very adequate.   I will return when in the area.   F"}
{"text":"I love this place! Well... it's within a 2 minute walk from my house, but it's genuinely great food and a fun atmosphere. It's a cool, local restaurant with good food that you can see the staff preparing. They have a good beer/wine selection, but their food is outstanding.   Their pork and short-ribs are awesome. The flat bread pizzas are good - especially the pesto one. Great local find!"}
{"text":"Had a great experience at Oven and Vine. Very ambient patio and interior dining room. Our server was friendly, knowledgeable and was able to recommend wine and beer that really suited our tastes. Further, the pizza we ordered: margarita and the second was a sausage pizza were both delicious. Simple yet flavorful ingredients. Will certainly return in cooler months to enjoy the games on the patio with a glass of wine!"}
{"text":"great food great service good wine  A great local find hidden in the back of the building  Very interesting menu and dog friendly"}
{"text":"I found a new spot to relax, enjoy a meal and genuinely be comfortable. I would love to know how the name for the restaurant came about, however it certainly does not reveal the delicious food we encountered. Easy to find, parking is great  food was delicious. ..the Au gratin potatoes, green chili, flatbread, it was a flavorful experience. Our server was attentive & informative when we asked questions about the food.  I was happy to have gotten to enjoy this find with friends & family ~ will definitely be back! Cant wait for the weather to cool, they have a patio that will be busy. Great wine & beer selection, did I mention those Au gratin potatoes?   Try the potatoes. Delicious!"}
{"text":"This is one of those places that I would drive from Chandler to eat regularly. #openoneupinchandler. One of the best comfort food places if not the best comfort food place we've ever eaten at. My wife and I had the Slow Braised Beef, Fingerling Potatoes (like grandma makes), & Fresh Baked Bread along with the best Tiramisu ever. The wine was perfect, the beer was perfect and the service was great (shout out to Austin)."}
{"text":"Service is amazing, food is delicious. Small but adorable in the heart of it all. My favorite lunch spot."}
{"text":"My wife found this place on Yelp and we decided to give it a try and we are very happy we did.   She had the Roasted Veggies and Fingerling Potatoes and LOVED them.  I have the Margherita flatbread pizza with Shriners Sausage and it was delicious.  This place has s super-cool vibe and we will definitely be back.  The menu is actually somewhat simple, yet well-rounded."}
{"text":"Met a client here for lunch & was impressed!  Unique location, good for conversation & right in the heart of things.  The food was fresh & delicious!! =)  I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!! It's a hidden gem in downtown Phoenix, and I'll definitely be back again and again after my experience this evening. Unreservedly, I give Oven and Vine five stars!!   The previous owners of Portland's started this place, so I had high expectations before eating here. Both owners were working at the restaurant when I went. Luckily, their attention to quality and investment in the restaurant shows in both the menu and their staff.   We had the braised beef and the Italian flatbread, and we then finished the meal off with some imported tiramisu. The beef was marinated in a light tomato stew for several hours and was incredibly tender. Fingerling potatoes accompanied the beef and were expertly roasted. The bread (including the flatbread) was fresh and delicious; it is homemade and, as a plus, completely vegan. In fact, everything tasted like it had been made that day.   The tiramisu, although imported from Italy, was carefully selected by the restaurant and the best I had ever had. Important to note: the tiramisu was HUGE- definitely a shareable dessert if you have more than one person!  Of exceptional note was the service. Finding great customer service is important to me, and unfortunately, it seems hard to come by these days. Not at Oven and Vine. Our waiter, Ronnie, made us feel like we were longtime friends of the restaurant. In choosing a bottle of wine, he brought us out some generous tastings to help us in making a decision. It was clear that he took great pride in the restaurant. The Pinot noir (Sharecropper's) we settled on was great!   All in all, Ronnie's enthusiasm was infectious and made the experience that much better. :)   On a final note, the building is architecturally cool and close to rollover donuts, which is also an awesome place. Oven and Vine was working on developing the outside area, and I look forward to seeing how that turns out. There are some games and places to sit and enjoy wine.   I will definitely be back again and cannot recommend this place enough!!"}
{"text":"Well it's a Friday and mostly towards the end of the evening. Let's try something different. I have heard nothing but great things about this place so I gave it a whirl.  Service was pretty good but this restaurant is small and it seemed that they had just got done with a rush. Wine selection was great!  Menu is small but accommodating. Had a salad and the brisket/ pot roast which was super yummy. The Mediterranean salad was ok. Was just missing something. Chocolate dessert was fabulous! Will be back to try the pasta which everyone was eating."}
{"text":"Loved this place. It's got a quaint, cozy environment; very neighborhoody. The patio and bar area are a great place to grab a drink while you wait for a table, though you may just end up dining there as others were.  And the food was excellent, and very reasonably priced. We started with the charcuterie and opted for manchego and burrata mozzarella cheese, complemented with prosciutto and spicy sopressata. It came with almonds and bread drizzled with olive oil. It was all delicious, though the burrata with balsamic won it for me. Afterwards we shared the Earl flatbread and quenched it's spiciness with some yummy cava and an IPA.  I'd definitely like to take another (a few more?) trips to Oven + Vine. Maybe next time I'll get their early enough to indulge in their happy hour.  P.S. The place does fill up fast, so don't be surprised if there is a 30+ minute wait. We were quoted about 45 minutes, but because some parties ended up eating at the bar, we were actually seated in less than 10 minutes."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere this place puts out. Very welcoming and so relaxing. The location is beautiful . I love how small and intimate this place is. I tried oven and vine for the 1st time last night and I was super impressed! Best pizza in Phoenix! Better than pizzeria Bianco! Dylan and Michelle are great people!"}
{"text":"Great place to hang out play a little giant Jinga or Cornhole. Love the food especially the smoky balsamic and bread. Can't beat the beer selection on tap"}
{"text":"I love this place. Awesome service and great food. I love the au gratin potatoes and their flat breads are amazing.  They also have a good selection of local beers and a full bar. The atmosphere is cozy and you can see lots of regulars. There is a light rail station walking distance."}
{"text":"A great atmosphere, wonderful high quality food and most importantly, solid wine selection. Tried the ribs that had a southwest tangy sauce and had a side of au gratin potatoes."}
{"text":"Charming little place tucked away in dwntn Phx. Stopped there for lunch and had the best green chili chicken ever! It is packed with chicken and rich with flavor and complimented with just the right amount of heat. If you like your green chili w/ heat, then you'll want to add this to your list of places to try. Oh and the potato au gratin is sinfully delicious. I will be back there to try other dishes....and the green chili chicken....again."}
{"text":"First time visiting this place after hearing about it for months. For ambiance, I would give this 5 stars. It's small, intimate and has a downtown charm to it. I would add that it's self-seating and we arrived at 7pm on a Friday night. We got a table right away but it was at the bar where my wife and I were outside and our 2 friends were across from us but inside. Still kinda fun!  The food was perfect. We built a meat and cheese board and they have great options, very comparable to Postino, if not better. We also ordered the Italian combo flatbread which was perfect. Their wine list is better than Postino and I had the Malbec. For dessert, my wife had the gelato with dulce flavoring and it was divine. I ordered the tiramisu. They only had one slice left (this was around 8:30pm on a Friday night so slightly disappointing). I share that because my friend's husband wanted one too. We ended up sharing it and our server added a candle after we all joked about the two of us sharing an intimate slice of tiramisu.   This will be a regular spot for ushering forward. It is better than Postino (with way better parking too) but not as close to us. But very worth the drive. We didn't even play corn hole but it was readily available!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is relaxed. The parking lot matches the seating. The food is good. I wish there were a few more options, but that's okay. Overall, I would love to eat there again."}
{"text":"I went here with a friend because she couldn't stop raving about the salad and roasted veggies. I ended up ordering the margarita flat bread. It was so good I finished it all!  We also ordered the chocolate torte for dessert. Words couldn't describe how good it tasted! It was a smooth texture with the perfect volume of chocolate flavor.  Everything was plus except for the noise level.  It was hard to hear the person across the table.  You get use to it after a while."}
{"text":"My BF and I love Oven & Vine. HOWEVER, we came on a Friday night recently and were treated like SHIT by some crazy short-haired bleach blonde lady. If you see her, BEWARE.  We tried to order at the bar but we were told by her several times in a very rude manner that we couldn't get service at the bar. Every time we tried to grab an open seat at the bar, she was quick to tell us someone was sitting there. Holy cow. We just wanted to order some wine and relax at our neighborhood bar. Instead, we ordered an Uber and spent our money elsewhere."}
{"text":"We stayed at the hotel right next door and stopped in for dinner. The flatbreads were great and so was the beer and service. The place has a great neighborhood feel and cornhole in the yard. The salad was not a five star salad but we had such a great time it doesn't matter. Maybe don't order the grilled veggie salad though."}
{"text":"Very, very good! Staff is friendly, & the atmosphere is intimate & accommodating. Chocolate torte with gelato is unreal! Great flat breads!"}
{"text":"Cool little spot pet friendly space to sit out back. Smelled yummy when you walk in service was good and food was really good I'm looking forward to trying the chili dinner. I had the itlilan sandwich and a salad that I loved. It was just the right amount, oh I'm looking forward to the beer and wine also."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in for lunch and this place is such a gem. The service was awesome, we sat at the bar up front and got to see the chef in action cooking up a storm in their brick oven. I had the rigatoni and my husband had their green chile pork, both were amazing and tasted so fresh, homemade comfort food for sure! Their happy hour starts daily at 11am, yay!!!"}
{"text":"I finally made it to this super nice place that many of my friends recommended.   It was exactly the way they described it if not even better.   I went to meet up with my friend and we were both first timers,   As soon as we entered premises, we were greeted by really friendly employee who worked at the bar area. She advised us that we can have a seat at any available table.   We agreed on the table inside. The place was so cozy and has such a nice atmosphere. Both of us being born and raised in Europe, this kind of place made as feel just like home. Our server even had European roots. Funny, ha?   He was super cool. Very welcoming and informative. He explained the menu, including the Happy Hour one. Also, he made sure to check on us during our entire stay.   We \"obviously\" ordered some wine and some of their extremely delicious starters.  Everything was great. Food was delicious and when it comes to wine, I never had  one I did not like :)   There is also patio outside and with beautiful Arizona weather, I can't think of a better way to go. Wine + Starters + Weather = Pure Happiness.   Parking will not be an issue either, considering it is semi-downtown location."}
{"text":"I wanted to have my birthday here yesterday because I heard many good things. I was bringing in  nine girls so I decided I would try to call and make a reservation. It was very last minute so I was not expecting anything. The guy on the phone told me they do not take reservations and suggested that we come in and wait for a table. I showed up at 6:30pm and told the worker at the door that we would have a larger party. He remembered me from the phone, and had a table ready for us immediately, with no wait. He ended up being our server. I believe his name is Austin. He was a really good server to us, very involved with our table. He made sure we were taken care of, had our food, had our drinks, and even brought me dessert for my birthday. It was an overall great experience and I had a great birthday dinner."}
{"text":"A really nice solid American restaurant.  I had the baked rigatoni with sausage--it really hit the spot.  The bread that accompanied the meal was amazing.  The atmosphere was really nice and my server was attentive.  Overall, a great restaurant for the neighborhood and worth a stop by if you're in the area."}
{"text":"All of the food we had was delicious! Place is in an old house downtown. Super cute. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Yummy food and good portions. My friend and I were seated immediately in the back. The server came immediately and answered all of our queations -- I was wary of this place because it seemed like they wouldn't cater too well to my dietary restrictions but to my amazement the server made great recommendations.  We ended up getting the mushroom appetizer (forgot the official name) and it came with some yummy bread ! I for the lasagna (nom nom) ! It has a great vibe and a very attentive servern!"}
{"text":"I have business meetings here all the time for lunch. Parking is easy. You can talk without yelling and the food is tremendous. My favorite is the pork green chile"}
{"text":"I came to Oven + Vine with friends who live in Phoenix. I'd tasked them with picking a restaurant because I don't really understand Yelp in this town. Last time I was here, we went to a place with a 5-star average that was decent enough, but without atmosphere, in a sterile mall. I was happy to see that Oven + Vine was less depressing, a cute spot with a hipster vibe, a nice oasis for a visiting Angeleno.  We went for dinner on a Thursday night and the place was vibrant and busy, with one of the youngest crowds I've come across in Phoenix (average age in the 30s, maybe even 20s!). The restaurant was in a building that looked like someone's house, complete with a lovely yard patio. We ate inside, and I enjoyed the homey, comfortable feel of the place. Service was great, too. Everything about this meal was just pleasant and easy.  The draft list was solid. I drank a tall glass of the Four Peaks Kilt Lifter, which has become my go-to when-in-Phoenix beer. I also tried some of the Two Brothers North Wind imperial stout, which was fantastic. Prices were reasonable, too. The Kilt Lifter was $5, not bad for a sit-down dinner beer.  I wasn't terribly hungry when I showed up for dinner--I'd been at a conference event with free tacos, and I have no will power--but I ordered the baked rigatoni and ate most of it anyway. It was quite tasty, the pasta made with house marinara sauce and herbed ricotta cheese then topped with mozzarella. Like most baked pastas, the rigatoni was slightly dry here and there, but it was mostly just satisfying. I added locally made Schreiner's sausage for $2, and it was well worthwhile. I also took a sliver of my friend's Italian combo flatbread, and this was a good piece of pseudo-pizza, the doughy bread topped with thin-sliced prosciutto, Schreiner's sausage, sopressata, mozzarella, and tomato sauce. I wouldn't say the food was outstanding overall, but it was pretty good and well priced--my pasta was $11 including the sausage.  I liked Oven + Vine and would probably come often if I lived in Phoenix. I had a great time with my friends--we hung out for a couple of hours, and it was very fun and relaxing. The food and drink were solid and affordable, and the place just had a good vibe. I haven't found too many restaurants in town that check all those boxes."}
{"text":"Came in for dinner with co-workers. Ordered: - burratta cheese with bread- the cheese was melt in your mouth and the bread was perfectly crispy  - fingerling potatoes appetizer- the mustard aioli was perfectly seasoned as well as the potatoes. Crunchy on the outside but soft on the inside.  - earl flat bread- The crust was perfectly  crispy and it held its own but a little salty. The sausage had a great flavor. The flat bread all in all was good.  Great portion size. Very cute unassuming place. I'd go back again and try other things on the menu for sure!"}
{"text":"Darling out-of-the-way place that has an excellent wine selection and delicious flatbread.  We started with the fresh bread and while normally I balk at charging for things that many places give away for free, the $3 is nominal for the yummy yeasty experience.  (Do it.)  Ask for extra olive oil and balsamic as you'll likely need it.  Service was excellent and when I requested the check shortly after our meals arrived, our waiter was on the ball with cashing us out and dropping off boxes.    A directional note: take Central to Vernon because if you try to cross Vernon from the west, there's a gate and you'll have to go up to Thomas for a do-over."}
{"text":"This is a great little place to chill with friends.  We had the burrata and potato gratin appetizer (so yummy) and a variety of the flatbreads. The pesto flatbread was phenomenal.  Our waiter was attentive and kind and made some good recommendations on the beer and wine. Would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Another delicious locally owned spot! My husband and I came here for dinner on a Friday night. Oven & Vine is located in a converted house off of central ave and has a very cozy vibe. After choosing our seats we both ordered Hoegaardens which were a fantastic deal at $4 a pint. My husband chose the sopressata & olive flatbread, and I had  the baked vegetable pesto. My husband's flatbread was delicious, the mozzarella was fresh and creamy, the sauce was flavorful and the olives and sopressata added just enough salt. My baked pasta was good, but fell a little short. I loved how there were a ton of perfectly cooked vegetables in the dish. However the pesto was a little too oily and formed a pool at the bottom of the bowl. It was also a little too bland, nothing a little extra parmesan couldn't fix though. My dish was served with freshly baked bread which was quite good, I used it to sop up the extra oil, so the oily sauce came into good use. I will definitely return and would love to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"My husband and I were loyal customers of Dylan and Michelle's last venture, and we were very excited to visit the new place. We ended up there on the night of Phoenix's epic hurricane (9/27/14 I think), because our power was out. They were bursting at the seams with other folks in our same situation and the camaraderie reminded me a little of the hurricane parties we used to have in Key West. We grabbed seats at the outdoor bar and munched on olives, bread, and basically everything available on the charcuterie  plate. It was all wonderful. The wine selection is compact but every one we tried was amazing. Considering how insane the entire city was that night, the staff was gracious and efficient. Although we're anxious to go back on a less eventful evening, it was a wonderful adventure and made for a very fun memory."}
{"text":"Terrific happy hour with good menu, easy parking, and pleasant staff. Sat outside  Very reasonable"}
{"text":"First time at this place and fell in love!! Can not wait until it is nice out again to enjoy the patio.  Food was good beer selection not to bad.  Service was really good they were very friendly and willing to give suggestions."}
{"text":"First off, this is a fantastic space.  An old 1940's home that has been repurposed into a fun, eclectic neighborhood haunt.  The old Vaughn residence actually contains two restaurant spaces.  The south section is an indoor seating area & coffee spot for Rollover Doughnuts (the doughnut kiosk itself is right next door), while the north section of the building is devoted to Oven & Vine.  I'd been here before for Rollover, but not Oven & Vine.  Remember the old Portland's restaurant on Central & Portland?  Well, after that operation shut down the owners moved into this space instead.  Admittedly part of my delay in coming here was specifically because I wasn't a huge fan of Portland's.  The restaurant location was awesome, but the food was overpriced for what it was and the decor just didn't mesh well with the neighborhood (in my opinion).  In Oven & Vine, the old Portland's owners now have not only a more intimate space, but one that allows them to be more creative too.  I decided to give it a try during Happy Hour on a Tuesday.  When I walked in the main entrance (northwest corner of the building by the way), I was immediately greeted warmly by the bartender up front.  On your left is the bar with the beer and wine selection as well as a chalkboard listing the wine of the day.  On your right is the sitdown area which is evenly split between high top tables and sit down tables, separated by an open wall with more high top seating in the middle.  The windows on the east side of the building can be opened up to the outside with additional bar seating and a very pleasant looking pocket park with adirondack chairs and even a game of corn hole.  Today it was 110 outside so the windows thankfully were shut.  You seat yourself where ever here as there's no host or hostess.  I grabbed a spot at the bar this go around (which offers a great view of the open kitchen).  For happy hour its $2 off wine glasses, $1 off draft beers, and $1 off apps.  I started off with a glass of their Force of Nature Red Syrah Blend.  I'm a Syrah fan so this suited me quite nicely.  The Au Gratin Potato appetizer seemed to be a popular pick among some of the Yelpers so I went with that as my appetizer.  The presentation resembled that of a pastry and was delicious from the first bite.  They blend of bunch of different cheeses into this rendition and the potatoes were super creamy but firm.  Thumbs up for this starter.  Their main dishes primarily consist of flatbreads so I decided to go with the Prosciutto Pesto.  Liberal amount of pesto sauce covered with mozzarella and pieces of prosciutto.  Another tasty creation and I loved the pesto, but have to admit I would've liked a little more prosciutto.  There was enough to let you know it was there, but just barely.  For dessert, I went with their housemade chocolate torte.  It was certainly rich and dense as their menu advertised, though perhaps a tad dry.  I've had excellent chocolate tortes elsewhere and while this one certainly had chocolate flavor in abundance, it wasn't as creamy on the inside as I've had elsewhere.  Still, a pretty enjoyable dish.  Total cost for the wine, the food, tax, and tip came to about $40.  Pricey?  Perhaps a dollar here or there.  Though I know Oven & Vine locally sources most of their ingredients so I know there's a premium for that.  On the whole, I was pretty impressed.  The owners of Portland's have improved a bit on their food menu and have chosen a much better space from which to showcase it.  During the non-summer months I would absolutely come here for some drinks and some corn hole on the lawn.  Most of what Oven & Vine brings to the table isn't necessarily new or something you wouldn't find elsewhere, but they deliver it in a casual, welcoming environment that I feel almost anyone would enjoy.  Historical preservation with a personality.  Who knew?"}
{"text":"I just read a Yelp review on this place wherein the author argued with the staff about whether the pizza had fresh mozzarella. I finally had the chance to eat here, and if I could sum it up in one sentence, it would be as follows: \"There is no way in hell that was fresh mozzarella.\"  That's really all there is to it.  Honestly, I had high expectations going into this place. I'm a sucker for old buildings that are converted into restaurants. I also like restaurants that are not part of the Sam Fox Galactic Empire. This should have been a slam dunk.  The flatbread crust (how hip of them to call it a flatbread instead of pizza!) has all the depth and texture of a piece of stale pita bread. The sauce was bland. We have already discussed the cheese. This is basically the Peter Piper Pizza of \"artisan\" pizza.  The oven had a door on it. A door! One cannot cook a pizza in a properly heated oven if it has a door on it.  I'm pretty sure they got their recipes and cooking techniques from an internet forum for Caucasian stay-at-home moms in Middle America.  Besides the mediocrity of the pizza (excuse me, \"flatbread\"), the other problem I had with this place is that it took about ten minutes before the server/bartender asked me if perhaps I would like some food, or something. Maybe it's the norm for people to come here and not eat. In retrospect, maybe they're onto something.  But hey, it's a cool space! I'll bet Sam Fox is pissed they stole his concept (\"mediocre {TYPE OF CUISINE} in a hip space\")."}
{"text":"This place is really cute, and in a cool neighborhood. I really wanted to like it but thought that it was a bit overrated. I am a pizza/flatbread snob so it is difficult to impress me with them. The flatbread was good, just nothing special. Also had the oven roasted potatos and veggies. Again they were fine but it seemed that I could make them just as good at home. I would go for Happy Hour if I was close but would not go out of my way to go again."}
{"text":"Lovely place. The garlic bread is stellar. Great patio and casual atmosphere. Be ready for dogs outdoors. The beer and wine selection is small but well curated."}
{"text":"First time there and really liked it. Place a bit smaller but had no issue getting a seat as we got there right before crowd. Great place to meet friends after work for a beer. Enjoyed the atmosphere and has outside seating. Their vegetable salad is good as was their flatbreads."}
{"text":"I have the biggest crush on this place. In fact, we are having an intense love affair such that I was here at least three times within a week span. You just can't resist the charm of the place, the people, and of course the delish carbs!!! It's everything everyone is gushing about. A local neighborhood spot tucked behind the busyness of Central but quaint enough to be your escape. You walk in and it's like being invited over for dinner. And it's tough, you get so cozy you want to stay for a very very long time. I love sitting at the bar, both inside and out, or you can grab a lawn chair and play the games outside. Once the weather coaxes you in, definitely plant yourself by the fireplace.  I can't really pick any one item that's my fave because the menu appeals to any taste bud. I do love the flatbread, the whole smorgasbord that they offer, to go with the beers on tap. The green chili pork with a side of potato au gratin...need I say more. And to add to the indulgence, have the chocolate gelato. One scoop is enough...that coming from the biggest sweet tooth ever. Trust me, it's going to leave you with a happy face happy belly all night long and for days until you come back. What's wrong with that?"}
{"text":"This has to be one of my new favorite places!  With outdoor seating it makes for a great hangout after work.  I plan to be a regular!  The flatbreads are great and the wind and beers on tap are delightful.  I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I came here last week with several ladies from the office. We enjoyed the food, but the lunch portions for the pasta are small and no bread came with it, so those that ordered the pasta were not terribly happy. The bread is extra and you must order it as an appetizer. Only the sandwiches come with a salad or chips.  Having said that, the Baconatarian sandwich was delicious.  The bread is baked in house (though a tad more salt in the dough would be nice, it was bland), and they use if for the sandwiches and flatbreads.  Everyone liked what they got, but again the portion sizes are a bit small."}
{"text":"Cozy atmosphere, good service and reasonable prices...what's not to like?  We enjoyed the baked rigatoni with amazing bread and the green chili chicken with au gratin potatoes...yummy!  This will definitely be a go to, neighborhood place on a cool day to enjoy some comfort food.    I am excited to see the further changes they are going to make to the place.  This is a definite must visit in Central Phoenix!"}
{"text":"This one of the cutest and quaint environments in Phoenix I'd say. Sat outside for lunch and enjoyed the beautiful day and small garden they had. It was truly like being over at a friend's house, enjoying great people and amazing food.   The menu is not overwhelming, which I enjoy. With the brain that I have, more than 25-30 options send me into a frenzy. But, this menu was perfect.   The waiter recommended the Bacon-Tarian. He almost had me...but I went for the Baked Rigatoni. It was great, only thing that it needed was a dash of salt and pepper. The serving size was just enough to be satisfied and not super full.   I wasn't too pleased with speed of service, as the restaurant wasn't packed. However, I'd much rather have slow but phenomenal service, than fast subpar service.   For the portion sizes, the pricing is spot on. I'm anxious to go back, but next time it will be in the evening. From the outside set up, I'm sure it won't disappoint."}
{"text":"This place is too cute. There isn't much signage so just know it is an old house and the door is on the side close to the back.   The caprese salad was so good and so fresh.  The chicken Lasagna was... different.  The flatbed pizza was amazing."}
{"text":"Wow, this is an amazing place! The food is great and the ambiance is to die for! Very cozy and intimate place - outdoor and indoor seating. Wherever you sit you'll feel comfortable as this is an intimate place. Great service too. The owners are very attentive. Michelle, the owner was fabulous. We ordered a bunch of appetizers and flat breads - all was delicious!!"}
{"text":"Not what it used to be. Service is bad. I can make better food at home. Nothig to back up the ambience. owners please fix this."}
{"text":"Vegan pesto. Enough said.  It is rather trendy, but surprisingly, we were able to get a table fairly quickly on a Saturday night. Our waitress was very friendly."}
{"text":"I had the green chili pork dish. I was amazing. The staff was friendly. She asked what we thought of the place and the food. Place was small but cute. I would definitely come back. Have nothing negative to report."}
{"text":"What a lovely, quaint place to get an early dinner and a glass of wine while visiting Phoenix for the first time.  The outdoor/indoor atmosphere felt very European so I went with it.  Ordered an Italian Prosecco and a plate of cheeses and meats with an excellent bread, and I mean excellent.  Ordered a nicely done dinner salad, as well.  I did not try their specialties and do wish I had another day to do so.  Perhaps I will get to come back someday."}
{"text":"Doesn't matter what food tastes like at this point. I am content and happy with this place. Quirky location, old restored house. Best for small groups 2-4. Staff laid back and friendly. Menu looks promising. Wine tastes great, bartender was helpful and knowledgeable about wine choices. good easy music, not so loud you can't visit. Came early hours, 3ish- so can't speak to wait time or ease of getting seat during later hours.  Happy Hour from 11-6, nice. Wish it was in my neighborhood.  Most of the seating are bar stools, a few tables with chairs. Respectable beer list. I will return.  Okay.....have tried the food. Yes a winner!!! Bread to die for"}
{"text":"Awesome location. This is the definition of hidden gem. They even have a fire-pit and chairs for outdoor service. Another excellent addition to downtown Phoenix's urbanite food scene. Menu has salads, charcuterie, flatbreads, pasta, and sandwiches. Staff was attentive and engaging. Awesome chill spot."}
{"text":"Thought about trying this place for a while and one afternoon felt like getting takeout and thought of this place. We got the charcuterie board, roasted vegetable salad and \"the Earl\" flatbread. As soon as I arrived I regretted not eating in, since the building is super quaint and cute. Walked in and they had a large variety of craft beer, mostly stuff I'd never heard of. We drove home talking about how we already needed to plan on going back and the smell of the food that awaited us as was intoxicating. We got home and killed the food in minutes! It was all awesome. I have to admit the roasted vegetable salad didn't sound very good to me but it blew me away. Meat and cheese boards never fail but theirs was phenomenal. And \"The Earl\".  So dang good. Perfectly spicy. Awesome ricotta, which I don't usually like all that much, and awesome sauce and sausage. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Oven + Vine is such a cute smaller spot within Phoenix. The owners transformed this1940's Vaughn residence to be a part of this great local community. The property and environment are perfect and it is a great spot to spend some of your time. The ambiance gets 5 stars but the food drops the star rating slightly.  The menu is simple and the prices are very reasonable. The portions are perfect and light for for any snack or meal.  I had ordered the Baked Rigatoni with homemade marinara, herbed ricotta cheese topped with mozzarella & baked. The baked rigatoni was served hot but was a little dry so the server brought an extra side of marinara.  I am eager to return to this spot to enjoy more of the menu and hang out within the yard. Cant wait to return!!"}
{"text":"Every time my fiancé and I find ourselves in the downtown area we make it a point to stop in for dinner. I am just in love with everything about it- the food is delicious and the atmosphere is cozy, unique and truly one of a kind. I believe it is a home-turned coffee shop-turned restaurant, and much of the integrity of the original home remains intact. Great date night spot."}
{"text":"We love this place--and not just because it's across the street! Everything is great- we especially love (in addition to the pizza that tastes right out of Naples) the green chili chicken, ribs and the au gratin potatoes. But more than this is the service! You're treated like friends and neighbors who've come over for dinner- not \"customers.\" Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite places! We love bringing friends and out of town guests here for a drink and delicious flat bread."}
{"text":"Love this quaint, cozy little spot tucked behind shine coffee. The gf and I go here regularly and absolutely love the food, drinks, staff, and ambiance. The charcuterie plate is a must, not many spots where you can pick two cheese and two meat options for $12, fantastic value! We also really love the ribs, they are crave-worthy and despite there being so many amazing options we continue to go straight for those ribs every time. They have a great beer selection that changes from time to time, but there's always something interesting to try. We tend to always have the same server, and I feel so bad bc I can't remember his name, but he is the best! Always remembers us and is a main reason we continue to frequent this great little spot!"}
{"text":"I swung by Oven + Vine for dessert.  I had my mind set on the tiramisu and it did not disappoint.  Light & flavorful without being overly syrupy or sweet.  Went well with my wine.  Super friendly staff.  It felt like a budding local hangout with welcoming regular/repeat customers - even though my Uber driver lives like 6 blocks away and was very surprised to drop me here - so, I have paid it forward to him just as I do to you now.  Find this place.  Order a whole meal.  Spend the night soaking up the company.  Enjoy sitting in the yard!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere in this place. Appears to have been a house at one time. Seems small at first, but does have more space than it appears as you enter. Plenty of parking out back. Small outdoor patio. Good beer selection, and you get a full pint. We tried a flatbread pizza and it was excellent. We will be back."}
{"text":"I stopped with some work friends for happy hour and was discovering Oven & Vine a great surprise.  With all the new, trendy places opening in Central Phoenix it is great to find a place that feels comfortable, fun, with great service.  Impressive wine and beer selection at good prices.  Food was good too.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Well thought out beer selection. The \"Italian Combo\" flatbread pizza I had was VERY nice. Met the young lady that owns the place, and she's a sweetheart. Super relaxed atmosphere. I'd be eating here regularly if I lived nearby."}
{"text":"I'm a fan! I went for the first time and the atmosphere is awesome and food is pretty good. I would like to see some more veg options though!"}
{"text":"Went here with co-workers during a break in our SAS training just down the street at MicroTek.  Man, the food was good.  I can't wait to come back with some craft brews and hang out with the Millenials during a prime time!"}
{"text":"This family-owned business has gone through a metamorphosis and the result is impressive. The food was delicious and paired well with the large selection of wine from different regions. I tried the Burrata with fresh bread for the first time and I can't even explain how delicious it was. I kept thinking about it after. We also had a pesto and prosciutto flatbread that was amazing.  Every dish is baked in the huge brick oven you see in the kitchen. Simple but ingenious.   I definitely recommend that you stop in if you're in the phoenix area. Michelle and Dylan are genuine restaurateurs with a true passion in combining excellent cuisine and making you feel as if you're in company of long-time friends."}
{"text":"It was pretty good.  I really liked the restored old house and the cool vibe.  They had a patio and \"backyard\" with cornhole that looked like it would be a lot of fun...when its not 108 degrees outside at lunchtime.  The menu was a little limited. Lots of flatbread options but limited options beyond flatbread - a couple salads and a couple other dishes.  Some more non-flatbread options would be my only suggestion.  Other than that, its a really nice, casual, local, non-chain lunch and drinks option."}
{"text":"Our \"home\"restaurant. Walk to, friendly, food is awesome and personal service is incredible. Great music, patio, and likely to run into a neighbor or meet a new friend"}
{"text":"Great experience! Super cute atmosphere, great food, fair prices, and awesome service!"}
{"text":"It is ALMOST a home run for me.  The food was great, but the whole experience left me wanting just a bit.  Maybe a little too \"at a friends house\" type of casual for me....  All in all, I would go back.  May even be more fun with the right group."}
{"text":"Totally loved this place. Visited while in Phoenix for a week for work. Super chill and flat breads and charcuterie were delicious. Home made bread was sooo amazing. Our server was super nice and told us about Phoenix and places to visit. Great beer selection on tap. Just really enjoyed relaxing outside here."}
{"text":"Last Friday night I came in with another person. It was busy, which we expected and totally understood for a Friday night. The look is cool and I thought that the atmosphere seemed really great at first. We grabbed a beer and iced tea from the bar and asked if we could order an appetizer but were told that the server at the bar was unable to do food service. We sat at the bar with our drinks for a few minutes before she asked if we would be ok letting a couple sit down that had been waiting for a while so that they could eat dinner. We stood. Then it hit me. She couldn't get us an appetizer but she could get them dinner? Ok... not the end of the world but it was odd. We waited about 15 more minutes before another lady asked if we were interested in sitting at the community table. We sat down and for the next 30-35 minutes we had no service, eye contact, drink refills, or attention at all. Again, it was Friday and I get that but someone could have at least said \"we are busy here are a few menus, do you need another drink?\" The person I was with grabbed a passing server and told him that we had been waiting a long time and he seemed annoyed. I finally got up and  said \"Forget it we can close out and leave.\" He just turned and left. I walked up to a man near the bar and asked if we could cash out since we had been waiting for such a long time to eat. He said not to worry and he'd cover the drinks and it was Friday and I needed to understand that. He didn't offer a big apology or ask if I'd like to order. Instead he made me feel like he would prefer if we left, so we did. This was extremely disappointing since I have heard such good things."}
{"text":"Stopped in here recently for lunch - Oven and Vine sits behind my absolutely favorite coffee place (Shine).  My connection was coincidental, as I'm involve with a t-shirt business, and Dylan the owner had come by for some t-shirts recently.  During conversation, I realized that Dylan used to run Portland's restaurant on 1st and Portland, which closed a while back.  That was a posh high end place that made for an awesome setting for business lunches.  Oven and Vine is a different vibe altogether, and I love it.  Much more approachable in a come as you are kind of way, and very friendly and easy going.  The menu is short and sweet, but has a good variety.  I was in for a light lunch, so ordered the Italian Salad, and another buddy ordered the green chili chicken.  The salad was awesome!  And the lunch buddy said the green chili chicken was as well.  Great place to hang out - good casual laid back vibe, of a seat yourself and get comfortable sort.  And I love the venue and location - I'm really drawn in by this historic estate pool house and long house setup that houses both Shine and Oven and Vine.  Highly recommended!  And you have to keep in mind this is all happening in a long house of a long-gone historic estate."}
{"text":"Honestly some of the best food I have had in the Valley. Truly a hidden gem. The employees are always knowledgeable, friendly, and impressive. Never had a bad experience. Only downfall is I crave them every Sunday and it's the one day they are closed, but we all need a break!:)"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots! Cute atmosphere, great wine selection, yummy charcuterie, and AU Gratin potato's!! Great for wine and cheese or if you want a meal the oven baked pastas are wonderful. I also love the flourless cake and tiramisu!!"}
{"text":"We went for our first time here last night & it did not disappoint. It was amazing! Super cute, aesthetic patio and little restaurant/bar. My husband got the Smuttynose FinestKind IPA, I got Roku Riesling (very sweet, desert wine which I love). We both loved our drinks!! Charcuterie (make your own cheese and meat plate) was amazing. We got the spicy sausage, goat cheese, and sharp cheddar. It comes with some garlic toasts, which were delicious. The Earl Flatbread is spicy and we split it - which was enough food for us with the cheese plate to start. We couldn't finish it and had to take some home!Delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"Its a little house from way back when tucked away on Vernon. It makes for a great date night , its one of those intimate settings, or in real estate speak, the place is very cozy. The setting is great for a date night is basically what I am getting at. It is not stuffy but a nice warm place to enjoy a nice quiet meal.   They have a good selection of vegetarian and vegan options which is always a plus in my book and a pretty good selection of beers including a rotating beer selection. When the weather is permitting they do have an outdoor patio area where you can play cornhole (not sure why they came up with that name !) and other lawn games. So if you were with friends it could be a nice place to just grab that post work beer outside.   Having said that it does get busy because it is a small-ish place and so there may be a wait or you can get lucky like we did and get seated in 5 minutes. The food is awesome and I pretty much destroyed whatever it was that came out. Also the au gratin potatoes are addictive, so don't ever get those, you've been warned !"}
{"text":"Loved, loved, loved this place.  When we sat down and looked at the menu and the nice micro beer and wine list and thought man if this place had cocktails it would be perfect.  Guess what, they have a secret assortment of liquor and a great kick ass Manhattan that is the trifecta of large, strong, and tasty.  Ok because I am also about the food, the food was amazing.   We started with the Charcuterie plate of 2 cheeses and 2 meats (I would have liked some more interesting cheeses and would love to see some more creativity with a chutney) the Caprese Salad, and the Fingerling Potatoes.  All three were nicely sized for sharing and nicely priced. We moved on to try three of the salads. The Italian was a nice assortment of meats and greens with Parmesan. The roasted veggie salad had beets, onions, green beans, summer squash with greens.  The Ashland was baby spinach with bacon onions and Parmesan. The dressing choices were a nice Parmesan peppercorn and a weirdly gloppy fat free Italian (just about the only miss tonight). For our next round we tried the tasty Sausage and Mushroom and the more interesting and even more tasty pesto prosciutto flatbreads.  Both were crisp and chewy and perfect.  I had the Green Chili Pork. This little casserole of tasty was had pork chunks and onions in a nicely balanced green chili sauce with just a bit of heat (I would add jalapeños next time).  Next to this I had the AuGratin Potatoes. Shaped like a load of corn bread, these were some of the best AuGratins I have ever had.  We split the bittersweet chocolate cake with vanilla gelato and raspberry sauce.  Nice balance but a slight miss with too cold gelato but still very good. Great service with good recommendations, wine and beer and the $140 bill seemed like a steal.  We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Food was good, beer and wine selection was good. We ordered the mushroom appetizer - it was delicious. For dinner we got the bacontarrion with the jalapeño gremalade, which was very good. Also we got the slow braised beef with au gratin potatoes- the beef could have used a little more flavor/spices but the potatoes were delicious!  Love the building- the Outside it has a lot of charm but could use some work on the atmosphere inside . Cute patio with some tables and chairs, also corn hole to play and jumbo jenga. Small place, first come first serve for seating, so expect a small wait.  Lots of vegan and gluten free items on the menu- if you're into that. Patio is dog friendly"}
{"text":"Bread is outstanding as an appetizer!  We had a pizza, which was good too.  Played outside a little bit.  Would come back in a heart beat if I'm in the area again.  Can't wait to try some more of the food."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place. Great outside area - keep in kind it was March when I came here for the first time. Had the braised beef and a BUNCH of wine - thank you Uber!  I sat at the bar and Austin was the bartender- great service.  Come here and enjoy."}
{"text":"What a great experience!  I had researched the location prior to going so it wasn't difficult to find, and it's in such a great spot!  We had no trouble parking (although as word gets out about this place I imagine that will change) and we were greeted warmly by the owner upon arriving. The ambiance is cozy and inviting, and as they continue to develop the space it will only get better!     My friend had the grilled vegetable salad and I had the proscuitto and pesto flatbread - both quite delicious!  The salad came without the chicken on it that my friend had ordered, and to make up for it we were given the most delicious tiramisu for dessert... didn't have to twist our arms much to take that!     Perfect place for lunch as the service was quick, the prices were reasonable and the food was fabulous!  Looking forward to returning, and when the weather cools off this place could be a regular hangout for outdoor meals and happy hours!"}
{"text":"Now I came here based on the Reviews of the potatoes...I ordered  the Au Grautin Potatoes and Roasted mushrooms for Starters... unfortunately I had to stop there. I planned on the green chili chicken and pork and Flatbread..for my daughter. .. but.. the Australian Grautin was bland but Cheesy..there was No salt and pepper on my table, so it was Super awkward asking for it. And the rated mushrooms were just that... it needed a Sauce! Or maybe even a filling. I was disappointed with my starters... BUUUUUUT..  there was a GOLDEN HALO... There drink menu is Beer and Wine... and ordering a soda consists of a Vending machine Can of soda and glass of ice. But they have a LIMITED liquor selection. So I ordered a MANHATTAN  and a Vodka LIMONATA for my Aunt. Annnd it was the STRONGEST... 11$ MANHATTAN  of my LIFE!!!! I called an Uber to go across the street to eat my meal.  If you want the best DRINKS  then Oven + Vine is the place to go..   I'd  be proud to make this the Happy Hour spot!!! But for food... I left and went to SWITCH. *all typos are attributed to the Strongest  and Bestest Manhattan ever!!!!"}
{"text":"It started with two...then a third joined in...by the end of the night there were five of us sitting around a table that was fitting for maybe three people. We sat outside from dusk to the darkness of night laughing and carrying on as if we were in our own backyard.  It was a Monday night so happy hour was light.  The waitstaff did not seem to mind how we went on and on eating up our Prosciutto Rustico, Manchego and Burrata Mozzarella platter with fresh baked bread.  And the beer went well with everything. There wasn't a bad choice on the list.  But oh what a night to live again because for just a minute life was as simple and delicious as the food that was sitting on our plate."}
{"text":"We had a great time! Had the cheese plate, seasonal veggies, and fingerling potatoes. Great spot if you want to nosh on a few bites. I liked the huge yard in the front with fun games for kids to play. Our server Nicolas was attentive and helpful. I will definitely go back. Need to try the flat bread pizzas!"}
{"text":"Went here for drinks and appetizers with my roommate. Not only was the waiter amazing but the meat and cheese board was on point. Really enjoyed our wine, conversation with the waiter (even though I forgot his name). Really cute place...although you may not know its there if not told about it."}
{"text":"Rocks! Great atmosphere... Menu is fun and complimentary to the wine list. Super comfortable and trendy. It is a must do for foodies and wine lovers. #vinosquared #vino2ultimate"}
{"text":"What a great little gem! The ambiance is relaxing and cute. The service was quick and good! I had the veggie lasagna and it was fabulous! The flavor was full and rich. I would visit this place again if in town."}
{"text":"Great service and extremely charming atmosphere, not to mention delicious food!! Order the earl flatbread, you won't be disappointed. We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"We love this place! The bread is out of this world. I ate the Margarita Pizza and the rigatoni. Both went well with the glass of Tempernillo. The owner, Michelle, was very nice and stopped by to talk to is. It is out of the way but worth it."}
{"text":"Really liked this place. The server was prompt and  genuinely friendly. I had the Ashland salad with slow roasted chicken, very good! My friend had one of the pizzas, which she really enjoyed. Bonus - cornhole outside!"}
{"text":"This is a very cute restaurant the waiters awesome they have a bacon sandwich it's so good I switch out my potato chips for all gratin potatoes diagram potatoes are amazing if you don't have a lot of time for lunch this is probably not the place to go over though you can call ahead and see if they're busy or not they focus on the food rather than time here I'd highly recommend this restaurant if you have time and he wants a place to chill this place to go"}
{"text":"Had several real good meals here. Flatbread pizza excellent. Lasagne very good. Chicken chili Verdi very good. Choice of wines good, servers knowledgeable."}
{"text":"Every time I've been here, service is great, atmosphere is fun, and food is delicious! It's pretty loud if you're looking for a quieter spot. The flatbreads are soooo good! Short ribs are phenomenal... great choice of cheeses. Drinks have always been tasty."}
{"text":"Great spot that has an awesome staff and excellent food. The pizza is great and they have a good variety of beers on tap.  What is cool is the setup on how you can sit inside or out."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Cake - Short Skirt/Long Jacket)  I want some wine with blend like a diamond I want some wine that tastes the best I want some wine with a crispy cut And bold and texture of elegants  I want a wine with the right allocations That is red and buttery and sharp as a tack I'm playing with my winery, I'm putting up my Yelp I'm touring the facility and trying our snacks  I want some wine at the Oven &.....long Vine   Oven + Vine is was a tad bit hard to find cause it's tucked away in a hiding spot.  However, once discovered this quaint little restaurant is totally one of the cutest.  It's a hybrid of Postinos and The Yard I think.  I came here with a friend one night and started with a bottle of wine.  For the food with shared their Ashland Salad, which came with Spinach, roasted onions, parmesan cheese, and bacon.    Overall, a solid start to wet our palates.  Then again what doesn't go well with bacon!  For our entree we ordered their Margarita pizza on flatbread.  The bread was doughy, but I find their tomato sauce very lightly added.  I kind of like mines heavy with lots of fresh leaves of basil to add the aroma.  The star of the night for me was their house made bread which I totally recommend.  Fresh baked and crusted on the outside while the inner bread was soft as a pillow and melted in your mouth!    In the end, Oven + Vine is totally worth a visit.  An older home renovated into a restaurant is always cool and their patio is literally a backyard with an opening to a bar which we sat at.  I rated this place a 3 star for their food cause I thought it was okay (but do get their bread!).  Service was attentive and tops! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Their food is incredible. I come here at least once a week and get my usual. The vegetarian sandwich with chicken, extra chicken, with a side salad and their peppercorn parmesan dressing. I typically save some of the dressing, or most of it, to dip in my sandwich. They also have a great beer and wine selection too. The staff is incredibly friendly and speedy. In cooler temperatures you can play games outside. Do yourself a favor and eat here, you wont be sorry."}
{"text":"I had the green chili pork, omg it was awesome....came with roasted fingerling potatoes, awesome also ."}
{"text":"This place is delicious loved the service and great atmosphere. I love how they support the locals in the area"}
{"text":"I've been here a number of times now, and have yet to be disappointed.  Since it is only a 2 minute walk from my house, it has become my new default restaurant when I don't feel like cooking.  There is enough on the menu to satisfy almost any taste: apps, salads, sandwiches, pizzas, warm plates....  They have a great wine and beer menu, and everything I've had comes out at the right temperature, the right amount of head, in the proper glass."}
{"text":"Oven + Vine is a fabulous new addition to the Phoenix dining scene.  It's tucked away in a renovated 1940's house, and totally worth seeking out... I did so last weekend on a date night with my husband and we had a lovely meal.  They don't take reservations, so I was nervous that on a Saturday night, there would be a wait... Luckily, that wasn't the case.  We were welcomed by several staff members and told to sit down where ever we wanted.  I loved the warm but casual vibe.    Austin was our server and was attentive and patient as we mulled over the menu and decided what to order... We ended up staring off with a bottle of the \"Force of Nature\" red wine and put in an order for the burrata, roasted mushrooms, and seasonal vegetable starters.  It was a gorgeous evening, so we took our glasses of wine outside and played a few games of cornhole before the food arrived.  (I won by the way!)  Love that they have a gorgeous patio, bar, lawn games, etc...  We then headed back in and enjoyed all of our starters and then ended up ordering the Green Chili Chicken with potatoes as an entree to share.  It's worth noting that the burrata, mushrooms, and chicken all come with bread, and the bread is homemade and very addictive.  Needless to say we had more than enough food!  We look forward to returning to this moderately priced, locally owned establishment, perhaps for brunch or lunch sometime.  Or even just for a charcuterie board, bottle of wine, and another game of cornhole!"}
{"text":"Trendy. Fun. Delicious. Its the kind of place where you get full off of an appetizer but you don't want to stop eating the food-it is that good! Definetley reccommend the Charcuterie (meat and cheese board). The pear cider is sweet and delicate. The ancho chile braised beef is heavenly tender and the flourless chocolate torte is smooth and rich. Overall an amazing experience and atmosphere, the place itself is charming, the staff is friendly and honest (Thank you Ronnie), and the food is 5 star at an unusually reasonable price. These people created an environment that compliments the full package of fine dining. Well done!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! A true neighborhood gem. Family owned and operated, this spot is beyond comforting and they are always happy to see you. It is the CenPho version of \"Cheers\"!"}
{"text":"Delicious Veggie Lasanga accompanied by fresh seasoned Italian bread! It's hard to find good Italian food in Phoenix, but this spot just reminds me of my mom's pasta back in NY! Everything I've tried has been yummy: Roasted vegetable salad, Roasted vegetable sandwich, even their garden salad is always very fresh tasting and the balsamic dressing is premium. The servers and cooks are super nice too! I highly recommend you give this place a try & make returns because I have yet to try anything that wasn't spot on delicious."}
{"text":"Great urban find.  The fresh bread contains just the right mix of smoky, salty, chewy texture.  We had several apps...the mushrooms and au gratin were hits.  We will certainly be returning."}
{"text":"This was a great place to get good food ad drink and get work done! Highly recommend for business professionals!"}
{"text":"Great food...and a little different in its presentation.    My son had the  bacon sandwich, which smelled awesome.  My wife had the rigatoni with sausage...which I tasted.  Very good.  I had the slow braised beef with au gratin potatoes.  Rich and filling.    The dessert was FANTASTIC.  I had the gelato affogato and my wife had Claire's chocolate torte.    The only reason I wouldn't have any of the above items is because I'd want to experience the other menu items.  We'd come back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"A hidden little gem. Delicious food and great service."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: Cozy little house with patio seating.  There's also a decent outdoor area with some lawn games such as cornhole and lawn darts. Also the outdoor area looks dog friendly..  They have a simple modern decor on the inside with a semi-open kitchen.   Food: Only had the Bacontarian and the Italian sandwiches, both with roasted chicken.  The Bacontarian was basically a BLT but the bacon used was thick cut.  There was a zesty jalapeño remoulade on the sandwich but the bacon over powered it.  The Italian used a sweet sopressata that was balanced out with the roasted red peppers.  Both sandwiches had roasted chicken added to them but it didn't help or hinder the flavor of the sandwiches.  The bread used on both sandwiches was home made, similar to a ciabatta.  Service: It was a little slow, looked like only one server was working at the time(During Lunch)   The server was friendly though and the food was timely.  Overall: Wonderful little place with good food and a small but decent selection of beer.  Would definitely recommend for small group outings or an intimate date night."}
{"text":"Had  the burrata and the earl?! Both are big hits in my book!!! Fresh and delicious !!!"}
{"text":"Oven and Vine has the potential to be great! Right next to Shine Coffee, the restaurant has a cute patio setting with a small grassy area for cornhole toss! When you walk in, the restaurant is small, cozy, rustic and cute.    We walked in during lunch time and the restaurant was nearly empty.  Our server was not generally friendly - it was a tad bit uncomfortable. I ordered The Earl and it was a pretty decent size for a flatbread! It was ok, but honestly, I wasn't really that hungry because I had gotten down with a burrito two hours before.  As we were finishing up, it took forever to get our check - in which I didn't understand why. When we left, I felt like I was missing something - I just felt uncomfortable being there. Maybe it's because of the lack of a warm welcome for dining at the establishment or even the \"thank you for coming\". I honestly think if the service improved, this place will be busy in no time!"}
{"text":"The braised beef and flatbread were delicious. They have a great grenache on tap. Also, the waiter I had was excellent. Very friendly and helpful guy. Great music playing, too. I will def be back to try out more of the menu very soon!"}
{"text":"Place was awesome.   Food was excellent.  Service was a little too laid back. Beer choices awesome and great atmosphere. Thanks to yelp for never letting me down"}
{"text":"This place checks all of the date night boxes. Ambiance, service, wine and beer selection, and wonderful food. We went here on a Saturday night and the place was empty... our server said the hot nights are Monday-Friday (not surprising since it's a downtown establishment). The prices were on the higher end of reasonable, but if you are looking to splurge a bit on a date night then you will not be disappointed. I tried a local wine from Camp Verde that was very smooth, and my boyfriend tried the space dust beer. We then split the special of the day which was a spicy southern pasta dish, and one of the flat breads. All of the food was delicious and the restaurant is darling. We will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Came to sit out on the patio and have some drinks and food while the little ones played.  Food was tasty, smaller than normal portions for the price, however we were more upset about the service.  When asked if we could move an unoccupied table next to ours to have more room for our party of eight, we were told NO!  Would like to mention that no other group came to that table while we were there and our party of eight sat at the tiny table placing our food on bar stools since we didn't have enough room.  We would have ordered more food if we had a place to put it."}
{"text":"I really like their food, but their service leaves a lot to be desired during the week. They are slow to take your order, it takes a long time to be delivered to the table, and getting the check takes forever. I work close by and like to go for lunch, but I have yet to be in and out in under an hour and a half. They also don't put salt and pepper on the tables, and if you ask for it, they either forget to bring them at all, you have to go to the bar and get them yourself, or they bring them so late after the meal arrives that you're already halfway through it. My experience in the evenings or weekends has been much better though."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch here the other day and was very satisfied.  My friend and I ordered the prosciutto flatbread and Italian salad to share and everything was absolutely delicious.   Our waiter made great food recommendations!  There is a nice outdoor seating and an indoor/outdoor bar top. Play some bags if you please.   Very cute little house with coffee shop just next door.  Highly recommend for a nice little lunch spot in Central Phoenix."}
{"text":"Super impressed. I'm not a foodie, but this place makes me want to become one.   One of the best meals I've ever had in Az.   Amazing flavors and quality foods.   The atmosphere and service was stellar as well."}
{"text":"This is a great neighborhood hangout. They have the best flatbreads and a good craft beer selection."}
{"text":"Great little place. Love the vibe of the area, it's very nice. There is a coffee shop/stand next door. The entrance to the restaurant itself was a little confusing to find. I think there are 2 different entrances? The door that says \"inside\" on the front is an extension of the coffee shop and is a sort of communal chill spot. We peeked inside and there were a few people working on their laptops...very quiet. The entrance to o+v we took was the third door down on the east facing side of the building. Upon entering o+v we were told we could take a seat anywhere. Great atmosphere and delicious food. My friend and I ordered the bread per recommendations read on yelp and we each got a flat bread. Soooo good. And the flat breads are a good size, nice portion. I got the prosciutto and pesto and my friend got the earl. The jalapeños on the earl were spicy! But good! The burn was real though. We had to ask if they had ranch....we were worried if that would be insulting haha. But they had a sauce similar to ranch that was ranch like but not? Our waitress said its better than ranch and it was really yummy, definitely cooled our mouths from the spice. Great place, definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Hard to find but well worth the effort! Tucked away just off Central Ave. kitty-corner from the Heard Museum.   My wife and I stopped in for a quick lunch. Service was prompt and friendly. Food was prompt and delicious!  My wife had the Pesto & Mozzarella flat bread and I had the Bacontarian sandwich. Both were perfect! The flat bead pizza was incredibly quick. No problem if you're pressed for lunch time.  A very versatile bistro: an excellent place for a quick work lunch, quaint place for a dinner date, fine for small groups, and it will be a great place for outdoor seating when things cool off.  Hurry before the word gets out!"}
{"text":"Such a fun place!  We had great service and the kids loved the lawn games.  Pasta was not great but everything else was top notch."}
{"text":"Great people and food! and wine of course"}
{"text":"I have been contemplating posting this since last night but I have to do it.    Brought a friend in last night since I have been raving about it.  Ordered my usual margherita pizza with spinach but opted for extra mozzarella cheese since they put so little on normally (I know that's how its supposed to be tho).  Pizza came and it was obvious from first look that the cheese was not the normal fresh mozzarella they use.  There were a few chunks of fresh mozzarella but mostly a yellowish grated cheese.  I tried a few bites and it tasted like the cheap crappy cheese.  I asked the waiter about it and he denied it and said it was all fresh mozzarella.  I couldn't eat the cheese and ended up taking the cheese off and ate just the crust and sauce.     The waiter came back a bit later and said he talked to the cook and confirmed it was fresh mozzarella and tried to blame it on the fact we had Burratta as an appetizer so the fresh mozzarella must taste bad compared to the Burratta since Burratta is such a top quality cheese.  I can't believe he said that but I dropped it.    I love the vibe of this place and every other time everything I've had rocked.  I will try it again but it it's crap cheese again I am done.    By the way... the Burratta I mentioned earlier was an accidental delivery.  We ordered the plain bread to start with and when he brought the plate it had Burratta on it and said he mistakenly put it in wrong and asked if we would eat it.  I said sure since they would have thrown it out otherwise.  I still got charged for it tho.  That's kinda shitty in my opinion.    I really hope this place isn't going downhill or cheaping out.  I hope it was just a bad night but I had to post it in case someone else has the same issue."}
{"text":"Well, we got invited to join our friend for an after work libation.  Goodness, would never have found this gem otherwise.  What a wonderful place. Good selection of draft craft beers, great service, and very comfortable setting. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Their beer list is amazing.  Great selection, its always changing and the prices are fair.  The food is good, although the menu is a little limited.  My only complaint is that the service is sometimes slow."}
{"text":"Quaint, casual, spot in a historic home with varied indoor seating and an outdoor patio.  A local hangout and a must try if you are in the neighborhood.  Fresh bread with oil while you wait.  Wide tap selection.  Sandwiches were well crafted and tasty.  Share this gem with family and friends."}
{"text":"Good beer..good appetizers and a great casual ambiance. They have a small and cozy outdoor patio seating with String lights and games to add to the fun times.  We were a large group who checked out this place and the server was accommodating in the seating us all together in the patio. Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I will visit this place again. I love the uncomplicated menu. Nice wine list. Great service. Family run. a very welcoming ambiance. I had the ribs, they where wonderful! Cooked to perfection and brushed with a not too sweet BBQ sauce."}
{"text":"I have been to this place a few times, but my most recent trip was awesome. Nick is great - super friendly and very knowledgeable about their food and beer selection."}
{"text":"Cute restored 1940 home with craft beers, wine delicious flat breads. We tried the olive and soppresata flatbread. The chicken green chile was spicy and delicious with a side of roasted veggies served with fresh bread. Roasted veggies had string beans beets roasted garlic and onion. It was super tasty. We also tried the au gratin potatoes which was freshly made and sliced with care.   They have an outdoor grassy area with a Nena bag toss game which amused us while we waited for food. They have happy hour on weekdays which got us a discount on the beer wine and starters!  Really enjoyed our meal and dinner date. It got busier towards six so come early to get a good seat."}
{"text":"What an amazing place! Hidden away off the main drag, but that's the greatest part about it. This place is in a cute historic home. The ambiance and atmosphere is outstanding and perfect for a quiet night out. The service was great and the food was outstanding. I ordered the  Roasted Vegetable Salad and au gratin potatoes. The salad was full of flavor and quite delicious. The potatoes were out of this world, best au gratin potatoes I have ever had. I will definitely return when I am in the area as there were many other delicious items on the menu."}
{"text":"Great food close to downtown - but not so close that you can't get in. Plus it's really close to the light rail, so that's very handy. Food was *great*! We started with the roasted vegetables, which were perfect. I had the penne pasta with sausage and homemade marinara sauce (awesome) and my friend had the chicken lasagna, which she enjoyed too. Bread was fabulous, and our nice glasses of wine really complemented the meal. All in all, a wonderful dinner."}
{"text":"A quiet location with good appetizers and alcohol selection. I'd recommend this if you have a smaller party or plan on hopping around to different locations."}
{"text":"Cool place to dine! Food was excellent! Would definitely visit again when I'm in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Have been coming here since they opened and it has exceeded my expectations every time. Excellent Food, Wine and Beer. For those of you that like craft beer, they have a great rotation of lots of different beers. FlatBread is my favorite but everything on the menu is amazing."}
{"text":"Don't go here because I don't want it to be more crowded. But if you do show up, order some wine and the charcuterie. The gluten free chocolate dessert is RIDICULOUSLY good. Service is excellent."}
{"text":"Stopped by for some cocktails before going to First Friday at the Heard (directly across on Central).  Had the roasted vegatable which lacked flavor and did not have any significant roasted goodness.  On the plus side even though it was hopping on a Friday after work, they were able to get us a seat at the bar within ~5 minutes."}
{"text":"Cute neighborhood spot in phoenix midtown, with giant jenga and cornhole in their cute backyard. The ribs are plate-lickinhg good and the caprese up there with the best. Also a good spot to rub shoulders with the locals of you're from out of town and want to chat."}
{"text":"First review! We just had drinks, bread, and olives, and everything was really great! Very nice ambience. The rest of the food smells amazing! The service was excellent. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"After a long day of travel from the east coast, I sought some fresh comfort food. Had the Encanto salad and Italian combo flat bread and a Belgian style ale.  Cool millennial vibe, regulars talking sports and entertainment. Nice outdoor patio. I had no parking issues but it could be tight."}
{"text":"First time visit last night and the food was great. I had the green chili pork and the scalloped potatoes and both were fantastic. The green chili pork reminded me of food from Albuquerque!! I highly recommend this spot."}
{"text":"It was alright. Bacontarian didn't have much flavor. Just enjoyed being able to catch up with my friends"}
{"text":"Some good and some bad about this place.  It's not all that big, so the tables are right on top of each other, so you will hear every conversation that is happening if you are sandwiched between a few tables like we were.  I'm not sure I wanted to hear some of the topics I got an earful on, but this is how they roll here.  It is LOUD in this place.  The lady at the bar with the witches cackle was particularly annoying.  Happy when her embarrassed date, rescued us all and drug her wine quenched ass out the door...Back to the food - Had the Italian salad - it was chock full of all things Italian (salami, Italian meats, etc) plus plenty of get your veggie on, so it was good.  Staying with the theme, I ordered the Italian flatbread.  It's a decent 6 slice thin pizza, with many of the same toppings found on the salad.  I have to say one of the best things about this place is the smell of them making the flatbread pizzas.  Really great sense memory as you can't wait for your pizza to arrive.  It was also pretty good.  I wasn't able to finish the last piece, but if I was really hungry, I could have easily polished this off.  So, a little hit (food) and a little miss (noisy and not very intimate for dinner).  Worth a try.  If I come back to Phoenix, it wouldn't be on my repeat list."}
{"text":"Many pizza joints on the area. This one is good and in the middle of the pack. Service was awesome, location is charming but hidden. We will be back because we support local and it is walking distance from our home."}
{"text":"Came here expecting to have a decent meal, but I got a truly peasant experience on all fronts.  We came on a Friday around 7. It was busy but we were sat right away. The first thing you notice is the ambience. It feels great here, very cozy yet modern and hip. It's a small location, with a great outdoors area featuring string lights and lawn games.  Our waiter was very helpful. He was relaxed and informative with the perfect amount of attention and he guided us to some great choices. We shared the roasted veggies salad first. It was simple but delicious and very fresh tasting. The veggies were cooked very nicely. The dish was served with a simple olive oil based sauce and I really enjoyed it.   We also got the green chili chicken with a side of au grauten potatoes. It was amazing! So flavorful, so full of meat and spice! It's essentially a stew, but its very lite for a stew - I didn't feel weighed down by it. Be warned though, it was spicy! Like it was borderline too spicy, which I loved. But they do warn you about that when you order. Potatoes were so good. I'll get them again.  Do yourself a favor and go!"}
{"text":"I just had a couple glasses of wine here but I was impressed with the service. I like the ambiance a lot. Quaint little place that I'd like to return to. It was perfect for our girls night, it was charming and quiet enough to be able to enjoy great conversation. They had corn-hole and patio furniture to relax in. I can't comment on the food, but I will be returning to check it out."}
{"text":"To numb our ballet barre beaten bodies, a friend suggested Oven+Vine for some wine. The location was a little difficult to find especially in the dark, but the private parking lot was spacious and led up to a restaurant space that looked like a large house. I was intrigued. After we found a spot on some adirondack chairs on the patio, we ordered a bottle of the 13 Celsius Sauvignon Blanc and some charcuterie and seasonal veggies. The wine was delicious and perfect for a warm fall evening outside. The charcuterie assortment we ordered which consisted Manchego, Burrata, Gorgonzola Blue and the Genoa Salami definitely hit the spot and included plenty of each to share. The veggies were also delicious although it did remind me of an Asian stir fry included snap peas, beets, garlic, zucchini, and roasted peppers. To top off the evening, the service was perfect! We had a girl that was training, but she seemed knowledgeable and was not overbearing while checking in. I would definitely recommend this quaint restaurant and return again!"}
{"text":"So it took us a while .. But wow-really really good food. Ali had the green chili and I had the ribs, we shared the charcuterie to start and all was first rate. Kudos to Dylan and Michele for making dinner great"}
{"text":"The best food is cooked in ovens and grown on vines, so it's really not that hard to look at the name of this place and say \"holy moly, I should go\". But knowing very little about this place, I'd expected another soulless, trendy spot for the yuppies. What I got was much better--a cozy old home re-purposed for stuffing your face with carbs and feeling proud of it. The hosts are warm. You seat yourself. It's like going to a friend's house.  What I liked: The au gratin potatoes. I am used to having them a bit more crisp--a bit more cheesy as well. But with this I feel as though it's less heavy but filled with more spice. My understanding is you can enhance it even more by adding some green chili sauce, which I'd imagine is idea for cold weather.   What I loved: The pesto flatbread is quite frankly the best I've had in this town. The dough, with its generous coat of olive oil is crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside. The dough is vegan, but doesn't sacrifice an iota of flavor. Also, the prices here are amazing, with many dishes costing under $15, all while competing with the valley's premier pizzerias.   I want to come here for dinner. Heck, I wanna go for lunch as well. I am never ever going to get tired of this place, and I feel comfortable saying that despite a mere two visits. I know it's a bit awkward to find, but it is well worth it."}
{"text":"Great local hangout, the staff knows their beer and wine selections, trust them. Great outdoor area with plenty of room.  Also very dog friendly, usually a few pets around, which is charming."}
{"text":"I wanted to try a new place downtown Phoenix and read some reviews and heard nothing but great things. I went on a cloudy night and probably about an hour before they closed. Not knowing what to expect I was asked if I wanted to sit outside or inside. I chose for outside since it was nice and cloudy outside. They had lights strung above the patio tied between the trees and lawn Wooden chairs. I order a darker beer and thought it was great but the waiter said he had a better beer if I loved the one I was drinking and brought me a free sample of another.  I had a great time and loved the open seating outside"}
{"text":"This hidden gem needs to be discovered! We had great beers and really good food. We had great service. The inside is a good spot to hang out. When the weather is cooler in Phoenix the back yard has many outdoor games with seating in in a grass and patio setting."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here and they were excellent. We liked everything about this place. The food was perfect and the service was quick and the waiter was super friendly. Also it feels very cute and cozy here. Leaving a 5 star review for this place was a priority for me. We will be back again. =]"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try something new last Friday and headed here.   Initial impression- super cute! Nice grassy area out front with bags and giant jenga. It was raining the night we went, but in the future, the outside area would be a great place to enjoy some drinks and games.  When we walked in, a waitress let us know it was open seating. I'm not too big on the community table concept, and the only space left was at the community table in the middle, but it ended up being okay.  Our waiter was pretty quick with taking our orders and bringing our drinks. I ordered the green chili with an gratin potatoes and my husband got a flatbread. Unfortunately, it was downhill from there. My meal came out 45 minutes later, and my husband's came out almost one hour later.   During the wait, the waiter stopped by once or twice to see if we needed refills but made no comment about the delay. When he brought my food out, he told my husband there was several flatbreads in the oven and his would be right out. Then about 5 minutes later, another waiter came by with a comped order of bread and olive oil. It was a nice thought but too little too late. How about brining me something to munch on while I'm waiting, not after I get my food? Also, the bread wasn't that great. I'm glad we didn't pay $3 for that. When my husband's food finally came out, we got a half hearted apology.  Food wise, I liked my green chili but thought the potatoes were bland. My husband like his flatbread, but I thought it was too soggy.   With our meals, one beer, one glass of wine, the night ended up being over $50. Considering the service we received, I feel that's quite a bit of money.  I can deal with delays, but I expect the waiter to a) acknowledge it while I'm waiting and b) make an honest apology or offer some kind of discount. I'm  hesitant to go back any time soon but I might give it another shot in the future.  And on a random note, what's with the bathrooms? You know how you go to a cheesy steak house and instead of just saying \"women\" and \"men\" on the door it says something stupid like \"cowgirls\" and \"cowboys\"? Here, they went with a Flintstone theme and the bathrooms are marked \"Pebbles\" and \"BamBam\". How that ties into the restaurant at all, I have no idea."}
{"text":"Staff's really nice, and the food's spot on every time.  We went to check out their new brunch today and got bloodies, mimosas, french toast and a breakfast pizza with schreiner's, jalapenos and egg.  Football on the TV, kids running around on the lawn, pretty much the definition of a five star Sunday."}
{"text":"Loved this new place. Small and quaint but just perfect!!! Great food and service. Definitely coming back! Food was great and lots of selection of beers and wine. Best new spot to try."}
{"text":"The best part about this place is the bread.  The food was atrocious! We order lasagna and it was a type of soup with undercooked pasta and water down marinara sauce. Definitely not coming back for seconds!"}
{"text":"So much love for this small, Central Phoenix bistro/wine bar. There's an outside patio for fun times (games too?) and a small but lively interior that beckons you to sit back, order a nice glass of red and chow down on some amazing and brick-oven loved dishes.  I had the mozarella pesto flatbread, a hearty portion of cheesy, grilled carb-heavy grill bread that was absolutely divine.   My beau had the baked rigatoni with sausage and he really enjoyed it. A glass of wine each, a roasted veggie salad to share and we enjoyed it all for under $50 with tax.   Definitely a keeper."}
{"text":"New favorite spot! We were looking for an Italian place near our house and we came across this place on yelp. What a cute, cozy spot and so close to our house we were able to walk. It's a house on the north side of Vernon that could easily be overlooked as the street is pretty dark. The vibe inside is something else. Between the fireplace and the patio it screams cozy. We got the veg lasagna, bread and green chili chicken. Amazinng. The bread comes in four slices, it was warm and so soft we even had to get more. The green chili chicken was way too spicy for me (I'm a wuss, just was trying my boyfriends meal) but he found it has a kick but not too much. Our server was also great. Very attentive and super nice (she was always smiling). We can't wait to come back again and try the pizza and other lasagnas!"}
{"text":"Love the ambience of this spot. Cool outside area with games. Excellent beer selection. I really enjoy hanging out here for happy hour. Another old house turned into restaurant. Love the charm of these places."}
{"text":"Visiting phx for work and found this place on Yelp. Loved it loved loved loved ...highly recommend this place. I got the Italian Flatbread. .amazing!"}
{"text":"Quality food quality drink every time with a great atmosphere... It's easy to forget about this place but I'm trying to remember not to."}
{"text":"The made to order, brick oven baked, personal pizzas are so yummy! Good wine, nice atmosphere, pleasant staff.  A little on the noisy/loud side, but great food."}
{"text":"Stopped in with a party of six. Nice outside patio. All thought the food and service very good. Worth a visit. Big wine selection by the glass."}
{"text":"A for effort for sure. Nice little spot in an old 30's style house.  The food was pretty solid. Not insanely amazing but"}
{"text":"So quaint and such a homey feel when I walked in. Candles lit, dim room, such a great atmosphere. I was told to sit anywhere I like. :)bso I sat right in front of the fire place. ( can't wait til winter arrives so they can actually have the fire on )  I ordered the roasted veggie pesto rigatoni.  Phooooo nom minnn nalllllll!!!  The sauce was perfect,  and the brocoli was not over cook at all.. that was what I was worried about. Hehe. Yummmmmm.  The veggie sandwich was wonderful.  And the chips, yumm idk of they were home made or not.  The guy who greeeted us was also our waiter. He was awesome, so polite and very friendly.   I neeed to come and try the pizza next time.  :))"}
{"text":"One of my favorite neighborhood spots. The food is great and the Manhattans are the best in Phoenix."}
{"text":"How do some places in the most organic and individual way find the magic recipe and get their mojo going at their own vibe? Always a bit of magic and mystery. Oven +Vine. They got their own thing going on!"}
{"text":"Oven + Vine had a very cozy and inviting atmosphere from the start. My friend and I sat by a window looking into the backyard. I thought it was very cute how a couple people brought their dogs. The wine selection was nice, however, I was not impressed with the tomato and basil flatbread."}
{"text":"Took foodie friends here. (They ran their own place in NM and make great homemade pizza.) The verdict is this place is a keeper. House white was superior. The flatbread had an intriguing crust with quality toppings; the salad was of quality ingredients; the vegetable rigatoni was worth coming back for; the braised beef was tender and tasty; we had a second order of fresh baked bread; but the potatoes stole the show. Candidate for Best Ever, reminiscent of Rosti. The whole experience was notably Continental."}
{"text":"This is one of my new favorite places. A cool renovated 1940's house. Plenty of parking. Did you catch that? There's plenty of parking. Well, I suppose the lot could fill up, but I've been there 3 times, each on a separate Saturday night and found a spot in the lot each time. Yipee.  K used to work at St. Joes Hospital, just up Central. So some of her old coworkers come here to hang. We were invited the first time and loved it so much we came back twice on our own. 3 separate times, 3 separate experiences, all amazing.  On one occasion our server was Ronnie. We couldn't have asked for anyone nicer. Attentive when needed but not in our face all the time. Paced the evening just right. On this particular night, K and I just had drinks. A couple of glasses of wine each while we visited with our friends.   We'll be back. The friendly staff, awesome atmosphere, and amazing patio would be enough but add the good food and drinks and its winner winner chicken dinner for sure. Great Vibe, Great staff, Great Food, Fair prices. Parking. 5 Stars."}
{"text":"Genuine & friendly service. Well priced menu with a variety of options to please anyone. A repurposed house that maintained some of the original features including my favorite, the tri-fireplace! Great addition to the neighborhood"}
{"text":"Great little neighborhood hangout! Fast service and good choices of beer and wine.  I had the Italian Salad with chicken added- it was pretty tasty.  I enjoyed it.  I also tried some flatbread and thought it was delicious!  Wish I ordered that actually.  We started with some meats and cheeses for an appetizer, it was a good start to our meal."}
{"text":"This is an extremely cute addition to the small center on Vernon and Central. The dining room looks like you are eating in someone's living room, which is great, and the decor is a mix of old and modern. They have many beers on tap and a good happy hour I would like to check out in the near future. The food was solid. The husband and I split the baked rigatoni and the margherita flatbread. The rigatoni was good, but tasted a bit like something you could make at home. That isn't necessarily a bad thing, as it was really fresh and tasty, but it makes it harder to go to a restaurant to get it (unless you don't cook, in which case it's great!). The rigatoni came with delicious fresh baked bread. It was a nice amount of food for the small price tag (9$). The flatbread was very good. It had a lot of fresh basil and was flavorful. It was also large, we even took some home (and it was good the next day!). I would definitely come here for the flatbread again. And did I see that it was gluten free? I don't even know how they did that... overall, this place was very good, I will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful! Sitting on the patio under the hanging lights having local brewed beer is the way to go. The chicken lasagna is great and service is very helpful. I would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Really cute place with great beer selections. Food is very good as is the customer service."}
{"text":"This restaurant is set in a charming old home. The food was delicious and affordable--perhaps smaller portions than you will find elsewhere--but delicious nonetheless!"}
{"text":"I would have given Oven and Vine four stars but I picked up a sandwich to go and got back to my desk to find it missing an ingredient. I ordered the veggie sandwich. The bread, which is supposed to be housemade, was fantastic. roast veggies pleasant. But I did not taste an mozzarella cheese nor did I see it. That was a factor in my order decision. Since I walked there and back, why use up more energy to go back just for that? Just hate every time I order, I may have to double-check everything. But I've dined in here before and the chicken lasagne was tasty and comforting. They also have delicious stews. And the people are nice."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, and I will have to come back and spend more time here once the near-endless summer makes it exit here in PHX. With space outside for mingling and lawn games, I could see Oven + Vine being a new regular spot. We ordered the charcuterie board and a couple of glasses of wine and enjoyed just savoring both. The wine/beer selection has something for every palate, and I would be surprised if you could come here and not find a new favorite indulgence. The servers are so friendly and easy going. I love that this space is in a cozy old home. Again, a great feel for cozying up in the fall/winter with friends or a book and a glass/bottle of wine."}
{"text":"Very charming place, our server was friendly and didn't rush us as we were taking a lil bit of time deciding what to order. We ordered the cheese plate, pork with green chili and ravioli. Pasta was just ok but pork chili was very good and great wine and cheese selections."}
{"text":"Hidden gem and just love the sandwiches as well as the flatbread.  I love the prosciutto flatbread!"}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum!! This is such a great little spot, plus it's walking distance from my house (incentive to drink more wine I think)! These guys know what they are doing and I am so happy to see the owners have more success after Portlands closed.   The menu has a nice selection of options, with flat breads taking up a good chunk of it. I've had many of them, most recently The Earl. Dang, that was one spicy flat bread but totally delicious. Their Ashland salad is quite yummy (you can't go wrong with bacon) and I also really like to get their roasted veggies too. The burrata is also delicious, I just wish there was more it to devour. I've also heard good things about the lasagna and green chile pork.   They also have a nice selection of wines and beers with the waiters all being pretty knowledgeable in guiding you to a good glass. The food is always out quick, servers always friendly, plus the decor is just adorable. I love the bathrooms (weird to say but check them out and you'll agree :D)."}
{"text":"I went there for late lunch on Saturday and it was just me and one more couple. Food was really good. I like the location, quite and hidden. Staff was good."}
{"text":"Just OK. The menu is small but sufficient. Burrata is a really nice appetizer and great for a warm summer night (or warm fall/winter/spring night since we're in Phoenix). Green chili chicken was a little disappointing - sauce was very simple and the chicken was moist, though a bit bland. Baked rigatoni was good but unremarkable.  I'd like to try the flatbreads. There's a nice big outdoor space though seating can be limited/awkward. It's good for bringing your dog. There's plenty of comfortable seating inside, too."}
{"text":"Such a big fan of this place.  My bf and I went here last night, to grab a drink and some food.  He's moving out here in a month, so we want to start trying out places to become our future haunts :)  We both felt this one would be visited on the reg!  The service was spectacs, let me just tell you.  On point, considerate, everything always topped off, empties immediately taken away - you can't get much better!  The food was tiiieeeeeeeght!  Any place with a charcuterie plate has my vote f'SHO!  We split that, the rigatoni, The Earl flatbread, AND the au gratin potatoes...if we weren't already bringing home so many leftovers, I would have asked for a second helping, to go.  That sh!ts was legits.  The ONLY thing I would change is more chairs and less bar stools.  I could have sunk in a little deeper if there were more chairs...good thing?  Bad thing?  You choose :)"}
{"text":"This little spot, tucked away on the edges of the Midtown Museum District and Willo neighborhoods is absolutely everything you want in a neighborhood dining/drinking spot. Nothing is bad.... Nothing at all.   1) the food is fantastic, everything on the menu is great... I know... I've had each item.  2) the beer and wine selection is top-notch. The beers are not your normal run of the mill, but craft brewery small batch and specialties. The wine is great and the selections are plentiful.  3) the atmosphere is great with downtempo music in the background, open view kitchen and great outdoor area for the cooler days and nights.   Most importantly.... 4) the staff are amazing, friendly, and know their regulars. Dylan and Michelle are amazing and have a great concept that is just perfect.   It's not uncommon for them to get really busy and the staff is small... So be patient."}
{"text":"Small restaurant where you wouldn't expect it to be with an equally small menu and a great attention to detail, this is the place for great Italian food in central Phoenix. I've had lunch and dinner here, pasta and flatbreads, and I've never been disappointed. Go on in, sit wherever you're comfortable (inside or outside), and tuck in for a great meal. Other reviews here have details on the food and service, so I'll defer to them. I'm just here to join the chorus singing their praises."}
{"text":"I so wanted to like/love this place.   I stopped in for what I hoped was a quick lunch late on a weekday afternoon.   I wanted to experience and save the Phoenix winter sunshine so I dined al fresco on the small patio (one large table and three smaller ones).     It took forever to get beverage service and I had waited so long already, I ordered immediately.  I thought a simple salad would be quick.  While I was waiting, the yard crew showed up to leaf blow and mow  the small grass area right by the patio.   Pretty loud.  I overheard the server tell the one other outdoor table that he wondered what else would happen this day.  (Obviously something was off.)  After about forty minutes from the time I sat down, my salad arrived and I had to wolf it down before getting back to a meeting.   My beverage wasn't refilled b/c I was told they were out of iced tea.  How does that happen?  I read good reviews before going so I hope this was a fluke experience.  It looks like a really cool place."}
{"text":"great food and atmosphere. I saw the waiter giving it some hustle. But we had to wait an hour and 30 minutes from when we entered  to until food arrived. Felt disorganized because we weren't sure if we were to keep waiting or if we could just order from outside. Eventually we sat ourselves, I will come back to give them another try when they are less busy."}
{"text":"This is one of the cutest little spots I have eaten at. The ambience is overall very trendy and feels relaxed. Beer and wine selection is great! Had a black butte on tap which I can never pass up. I ordered the pesto prosciutto and the man ordered the marguerite. Both were phenomenal. We also had ordered the fresh baked bread which was also good. The reason this place is only a four star for me is due to the slow and not ultra welcoming service. Not a deal breaker, but it's still nice to eat somewhere that the folks seem to enjoy working at!"}
