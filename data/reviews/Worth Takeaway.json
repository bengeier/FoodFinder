{"text":"Tried WORTH on a whim after seeing other Yelp reviews.  Had the Chicken Veggie Hash for lunch, which was *amazing*!  It comes with \"roasted seasonal vegetables\" which happened to be sweet potatoes and asparagus.  DELICIOUS!    Another bonus is that they offer GLUTEN FREE options for the sandwiches.  Any sandwich can be served without bread over a bed of greens and sweet potatoes (excluding grilled cheese).    Give it a try, it's WORTH it!"}
{"text":"Soooo delicious! I've had the chicken breakfast hash and the chicken sandwich. So unique and delicious. Best flavor ever. Excited to try more"}
{"text":"Crispy Chicken sandwich is great. Their pickles are so good. I had a cherry vanilla italian soda there a while back too that I still think about."}
{"text":"This delightful \"dee-lish\" is definitely WORTH  :-) a Yelp Yummy Accolade!  I had the chicken veggie hash and if I didn't live 40 + miles afar - this would be my daily  Worth Takeaway!   Atmosphere was courteous and charming... as were the warmhearted Worth-ian employees. Yes I think we just became best friends ...."}
{"text":"Friendly, fresh and fantastic food!  I tend to go towards things on the menu I know are good but I'm constantly trying new items every visit and every time I'm wanting more.  The ingredients are fresh and the sandwiches don't  taste like your typical sandwich chain store."}
{"text":"So my first thought when I went in was who on earth pays this much for a sandwich?!  However upon first bite, I can honestly say I'd pay that much for a sandwich now!  Check it out, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing! The menu consists of just a few, carefully curated sandwiches. We shared the Ruben, Croque Madame, and the Crispy Chicken.. All of which were amazing! The owner was very generous in sharing samples of their house made pickles, pork, and almond milk. Highly recommended!!  Also--try the house-made nitro cold brew coffee!!"}
{"text":"Wow I just had their Cuban with homemade chips it was awesome.  It's a tad pricy (just under $11 without drink) for a sandwich in downtown Mesa but it was worth it. I will most certainly be back as my office is within walking distance."}
{"text":"Great little sandwich shop in downtown Mesa.  We were going to takeaway but it was so nice and cool that we stayed to eat in this tiny establishment.  My sister and I shared two sandwiches--the chicken salad and the cuban--both excellent.  The chicken salad is not the usual mayonnaise-laden combination but a bit light lighter with olive oil and a light tasting blue-cheese dressing.  The cuban had the best shredded pork with sweet/spicy pickles.  Loved them both.  Homemade chips are a must but easily shared between 2-4.  And the banana pudding is a so good!  The sandwiches are quite filling so we ended up taking home extras which was also a treat.  Nice service and staff.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"This was perhaps the best Reuben sandwich I've ever had! The homemade chips were a perfect addition, I only wish I had saved room for dessert. My five star rating is not only for the delicious food, but also for the wonderful service. Well done! I will certainly be back on my next visit to Mesa!"}
{"text":"Worth takeaway is outstanding! Unassuming frontage, but you know you got the prize when you step inside. Pastrami Croque Madam and Reuben are both unbelievable. The Reuben is a bit non traditional with pastrami and havarti, but they make their own sauerkraut, and it's terrific. The owner, Kelsey, took time to talk with us, and was very generous with sharing samples of the pickles, red cabbage, almond milk... All things made on-site. The pork for the Cuban sandwich wasnt ready when we ordered, but after our meal, it was ready and Kelsey have us a sample... Wow!  The menu is simple and short compressed to other places... But those other places are surely trading quality for quantity.  The nitro cold brew coffee was a unique beverage, foamy and creamy, a wonderful surprise. Ciabatta bread is locally sourced, and deserves mention, as any sandwich lover knows that is the foundation of a great sandwich. Seek out this restaurant, it is worth the hunt."}
{"text":"The food is awesome,from the regular menu items to the daily specials, you will not be disappointed.   Don't forget to try the banana pudding; it is the best I've had."}
{"text":"Great spot to grab a bite to eat. This place is owned by a married couple that took a huge risk on investing in the newly revitalized downtown Mesa. The owners and staff are friendly and accommodating. Atmosphere is warm and aromatic. They know their food.  The buffalo chicken sandwich is amazing! I'm looking forward to trying out what's left on the menu. The chef Mat gave me a sample taste of the bechamel sauce (mouth watering) that goes on their pastrami croque madame. Maybe that's next on the list. Also, every monday night they have a unique dinner special. So call in and ask what's for dinner!  Suggestion: Make croutons out of that amazing bread for the salad greens."}
{"text":"SO. FREAKING. GOOD. Best sandwich place ever - never consider going to another one. Staff is super friendly too."}
{"text":"This place is simply amazing.  I have come here a handful of times and each time it's better than the last!  The staff is nice and accommodating and the food is delicious and portioned very generously.  My go-to is the crispy chicken sandwich and I always get extra honey siracha sauce on the side to drench my sandwich in- the sauce is PHENOMENAL.  The banana pudding is out of this world, and I don't even like bananas.  I love that everything is local from the delicious milk they sell (Danzeisen Dairy) to the bread they use for their sandwiches.  I don't live close to Mesa where they are located but the trip out there is worth it every time- hence the name.  LOVE this place- RUN and check it out!"}
{"text":"So good.  So happy a place of this quality is in downtown Mesa.  We live in Mesa and places like Worth make me proud to be here.  Hopefully more great restaurants and shops like this will follow.  Not cheap but you definitely get what you pay for here.  We had the buffalo chicken sandwich and it was superb.  It reminded me (in regards to quality of ingredients) of Pane Bianco.  If you like good, quality ingredients you will like Worth."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches but a little on the pricey side. Complimentary bottled water is a really nice touch and you definitely get the small locally owned vibe in this restaurant. Hard to find from the street... look for the outside seating area first that is right on Main St. and then you will see Worth."}
{"text":"Best chicken salad sandwich ever!  Ice tea was yummy, too. Great service and clean restaurant. This is my first time here and I had to share!"}
{"text":"Such a great vibe! The owners were so kind and just really great people! My husband and I loved our sandwiches and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Just attended a two day function in Mesa, both days were catered by Worth. I couldn't wait for day two just to enjoy the food again. Actually at the end of day two we decided to go to the restaurant for dinner also. Get this, you can stop at the Oro brewery just a couple doors east, get a great beer and Worth will deliver right to your table. That is awesome. Menu is short, everything is delicious.. Well.... WORTH IT.. :)"}
{"text":"If you want excellent food hearty and meaty this is the place. Don't be fooled by the hole in the wall appearance. My favorite is the Cuban bowl. Perfectly tender pulled pork with cubed sweet potatoes mixed salad and Havarti cheese topped with well balanced Dijon sauce."}
{"text":"There is a reason for all of these five-star ratings. The food was amazing! Takeaway is a key part of the name--there is very limited seating inside. We were lucky to get there a little early, beating most of the lunch crowd, and got a seat at the one long table. (As in the one, the only, table. There are a few bar seats around the perimeter.) My first reaction in looking at the menu was. \"Huh, not much to chose from.\" Then I realized everything was very unique. I had the chicken-salad sandwich with picked apples and blue cheese. Wow. The complimentary bottled water was a pleasant surprise. It is a little ways down Main street from the hub of downtown, but worth the walk."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious and worth the trek up to Mesa!  I had the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich and it was so flavorful!  I live in SC and wish I could come and have that sandwich again!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful when you run into a restaurant u have bookmarked ... The Big bonuses is that it's near my Doctor's new location !! So happy !!  Homemade chips big win... Love them... Crispy chic sandwich....mouth full of Goodness...!!!"}
{"text":"What can I say? This place has great sandwiches. Friendly staff, hipster environment, great food. Try out their root beer on tap its stellar! Definitely coming back here again."}
{"text":"Where to start !! I had the Cuban and the crispy chicken sandwich with chips and that AMAZING banana pudding. Everything I ate was perfect , you can tell that it's a scratch kitchen , including the pickles on the sandwich , home made pudding , local ciabatta ! This little restaurant was buzzing during lunch , really happy to see such great from scratch food being put back on the table , opposed to the cookie cutter chain restaurants popping up everywhere. 5 ***** easily job well done.  Can't wait to be back to try the Ruben !!!"}
{"text":"The brussles sprout and sweet potato breakfast hash with chicken is DIVINE. The sweet potatoes have this incredible char on them (seriously drooling just typing this). I'm so excited to get back to taste the cold brew and the lunch/dinner offerings. In addition to the great food, the atmosphere of Worth is a breath of fresh air. The open white space is clean and relaxing (not to mention VERY instagrammable). Can't wait to get back and support this amazing small business."}
{"text":"My wife and I had business in the area yesterday and decided on an early lunch. WOW. Small and family-owned our sandwiches were creative and tasted amazing. She enjoyed the generous grilled cheese which was on a raisin nut bread wth a side of house made jam. Of course I had a bite! I had their Rueben which was served on a chibatta roll. Again a generous portion,  the pastrami was tender, flavorful and not fatty. Really good value considering the quality of the ingredients. In the era of chain restaurants it's good to know that you can still find spots like this. We so enjoyed lunch under an umbrella covered table out front while it rained softly, perfect. Chatting with the friendly owner was fun too!"}
{"text":"Second visit at lunch time and the place was packed.  Not a bad thing since great minds think and eat alike.  Had the Cuban which was straight up delicious. Next visit will be for the half chicken.  Fresh, flavorful, and created with a side of love.  Thanks Worth you truly are."}
{"text":"Biscuits and gravy special was amazing. Eggs were cooked perfectly and the sausage was fantastic. Gravy was just the right amount of salty. Friend got a buffalo chicken sandwich.  Not too spicy just right. 10/10 without rice. Fantastic experience."}
{"text":"Everything i have ever had from here has been great. You wouldn't think it but home made potato chips are your favorite side dish ever.  I have had the Ruben,  the Cuban, and the grilled cheese all excellent always made with love.  Is it pricey? Yeah but it's WORTH it every damn bite."}
{"text":"Great Place Crispy Chicken is wonderful get sirachi honey dipping sauce for your chips be back tomorrow for the Cuban"}
{"text":"The Buffalo chicken sandwich is delicious. I believe it has blue cheese and carrots in it that give it a surprising yet delicious taste that has me coming back for more. It's it pricey at around 10$ but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"I ate 2 meals at Worth today- really tasty!!! Breakfast Sammy and Cold Brew was a great way to start the day! They are known for their Crispy Chicken, but I don't eat chicken, so upon suggestion I subbed fried sweet potato--- awesome decision! Staff are very kind and attentive, portions are pretty generous- scratch-made craft sandwiches totally WORTH the price. And that banana pudding!"}
{"text":"We had worth takeaway cater for our wedding, and the food was amazing!!!! Kelsey is freaking awesome and made everything perfect and everyone happy for my big day. They did such a good job and all of our guests loved the food. I really love them and so happy we had them cater for us. Please eat here! Or have them cater for you! You will not be disappointed! Best food and best people at worth takeaway!!!!!"}
{"text":"We were out visiting my parents from NJ and looking for a place to eat after seeing the Museum Of Natural History.  The place was still brand new, but it had so many great reviews that we stopped in.  I had the chicken and vegetable hash.  The Brussels sprouts and sweet potato were perfectly browned.  The chicken appeared to have been slow cooked and shredded and also had just the right amount of browning to make the edges slightly crispy while still retaining juiciness!  The egg was also cooked perfectly and I got that molten yolk dripping down into the dish when I put the edge of my fork into it.  If I lived in Mesa, I'd have that for breakfast all the time.  My daughter had the grilled cheese.  It was a little fancy compared to what she normally thinks of as grilled cheese, but she thoroughly enjoyed it.  The in house potato chips are killer!  I see a lot of reviews commenting on portion size and price.  While I don't disagree, I would add that there is value in the quality of ingredients they are obviously using here (also, I was shocked that bottled water was on the house, so there's that).  I will definitely stop in every time I'm in Mesa!"}
{"text":"My Ruben sandwich was awesome. It is a small no frills place. But the service was great (very nice people), and the food is great. You should come here if you want a tasty lunch."}
{"text":"This place is very San Franciscan in the best way possible. Sandwiches are hefty and mouth-dropping good. Literally everything on the menu is worth trying. They keep the menu small enough that they've been able to perfect everything. Homemade potato chips are solid. It's a small joint (like a San Fran breakfast shop) so it gets busy quickly. Have a plan B for where you want to eat the food provided if they run out of seating."}
{"text":"I was on this side of town and found this place on Yelp. 100% satisfied with the food and service! I had the crispy chicken sandwich , which was AMAZING. Then to top it off, eggnog banana pudding! Definitely will visit again when I'm in Mesa."}
{"text":"Found this place by searching nearby and so glad we found it! Everything from our sandwiches to the locally made soda was perfection. Our server and the owner were so sweet and helpful. If you're in the area... go go go!"}
{"text":"Goodness gracious... I just had their veggie sandwich and F&%* was it AMAZING. My taste buds were in heaven. Definitely returning SOON."}
{"text":"Best crispy chicken sandwich I ever had. Best banana pudding I ever had. Once they get some bigger signage so they're easier to find (it's a really small place) this place will blow up."}
{"text":"Great little sandwich shop! We really enjoyed the breakfast items and they had a delicious chocolate milk! The person who helped us was great they offered complimentary bottled water which I was very appreciative of. Go check it out!"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh!!!! We read about the banana pudding and almost didn't get it because we were too full from the delicious cuban and crispy chicken sandwiches. YOU MUST GET THE BANANA PUDDING!!!! It is so is incredibly delicious. The house made soda was also amazing. Customer service was great and so was the owner."}
{"text":"We came because the reviews and pictures were awesome. This place is truly fantastic! The atmosphere is fresh and clean and bright, not too much room, but we came around 11 am on Thursday and had the table we needed to talk and catch up. They have a smallish menu, but I would've been willing to eat anything on it. We needed up with 3 crispy chicken, a Reuben on a bed of greens and roasted sweet potatoes (an option if you're interested in low carb or more of a salad experience. I did not regret it!), and some of the soup of the day, a lively vegetables and rotisserie chicken. Don't miss a chance to try the house drink, a sparkling lemon Rosemary, loved the tart goodness. Everything was amazing, flavors were incredible, service was great, I didn't really want to leave. I regret we did not have room to try the banana pudding, people say it's the bomb. Don't make our mistake!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service!!! I would recommed Worth Takeaway to everybody. I've never had a problem with staff. The food is bomb!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time a couple weeks ago. Good customer service and excellent tasting good. I ordered two breakfast sandwiches during my first visit and got the buffalo chicken sandwich on my second visit. Both are a must try!"}
{"text":"I could eat their crispy chicken everyday and still crave it. Their bread is to die for !"}
{"text":"We were in Phoenix and decided to try because the reviews were so amazing. I got the Cuban, my husband got the chicken salad, and my daughter got the crispy chicken. They were ALL amazing- however the crispy chicken was TO DIE for! Get that if you go! People nice, great sandwiches!"}
{"text":"The coffee is okay, but my favorites are the freshly made potato chips and their biscuits and gravy!"}
{"text":"This is long overdue!!! Owners are such nice people.  I got hooked on the Crispy chicken Sandwich.  Their Cuban sandwich is also so delicious... On my first visit I also tried their reuben!!!! They really use fresh ingredients... Their take on their home made mustard, and pickles are all worth coming back for.    Banana pudding-- Very delicious & yummy!!!!  Its really worth to take away!!!!"}
{"text":"Cute decor, kind service, delicious menu. Some of the best bread I have ever tasted. And the banana pudding rivals Magnolia Bakery in NYC!"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to see what was in downtown historic Mesa as long as we were here. We had an amazing breakfast and the nitro coffee was smooth! Great new place!"}
{"text":"I'm tired after a long week of work, and drop by this tiny gem (seriously you might miss it if you were just passing by) for lunch.  I take a bite of the chicken veggie hash (sweet potato + asparagus + chicken + fried egg) , and the food **literally** brings a smile to my face. If that isn't a 5/5 I don't know what is."}
{"text":"I live near by and their food regularly. Their commitment to quality innovative sandwiches is outstanding. Besides their set menu, the gave a weekly special, usually a sandwich. In addition, their delicious soups are made from scratch and seldom repeat. Their also offer a scrumptious rotisserie chicken, ordered 90 minutes in advance. Plus, you can order from Oro Brewery and they'll deliver."}
{"text":"Two words...Banana Pudding. Amazing. The Ruben, cold brew coffee, homemade \"pop\" were all superb. The absolute best part are the owners, Kelsey and Jim Bob, however. True neighborhood, local business vibe. Felt like dinner at a friends. A must in Mesa. Your loss if you miss out."}
{"text":"Got a crispy chicken sandwich and a reuben,  banana pudding and a thyme pear cranberry soda. Delicious!  The chicken sandwich was amazing amazing amazing. Juicy chicken, crispy breading, salted perfectly.  Went so well with the pickles and Sriracha mayo.  That is the best chicken sandwich I have ever had hands down. The reuben was good as well.  Great job on the house made slaw, perfect proportion to the pastrami.    Banana pudding is again heaven.  And if you like thyme you would love the soda. Service was friendly and prompt and I really appreciate that"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch on a Friday. I really wanted to like it, but just didn't. I ordered the chicken salad sandwich, and was surprised that it was hot. Not what I was looking for on an already warm afternoon."}
{"text":"I have been hearing about this place while vacationing in town. It is located right next to the hotel I am staying at. Located on  Main St in the up and coming downtown Mesa. I decided to try the special which was their tuna melt. It was truly outstanding! The staff was very friendly. I can't wait to go back and try other menu items"}
{"text":"Food is delicious and the ingredients are locally sourced! Must stop here in Downtown Mesa."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I didn't actually have a sandwich. I went in because I thought it was a coffee place, but found it was more of a food-kind-of-joint -- that's alright with me! I find there are so many places to get coffee my head spins sometimes. The woman working the counter was super nice and she refilled my iced tea and brought it out to me (I was outside) and recommended some chips and dip, though I wasn't very hungry. I was very pleased with the space and glad I could sit outside. The tea was great, the chips and dip were great, the build out was really nice, and the service was great. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing sandwiches.   I was in Mesa all week and ate lunch there every chance I could get"}
{"text":"Wow! Nitro cold brew coffee!!!!!! The Cuban and crispy chicken sandwich are on point.  Never leave without trying the banana pudding.  I will be back again and again."}
{"text":"Ok so it's the day after Christmas and we are all sick of holiday food. Decided to stop at this little gem for lunch and oh my!! I chose the Sweet Potato Chicken Hash and hubby got the Cuban Sandwich and homemade chips. The food was great. The menu is simple and healthy. A tad on the pricey side but worth it. The location is a little sketch so keep an eye out for riff raff."}
{"text":"This is my first time been here. Their crispy chicken sandwich really worth a try! The bread, the crunchy fried chicken and the sauce all are delightful. Maybe next time I'll try another sandwich and order with a salad."}
{"text":"Was in Mesa and decided to Yelp what was good in the area. Worth Takeaway was near the top of the list with most reviewed/best reviewed so I decided to give it a shot. Glad I did because it hit the spot for sure. If I'm ever back in the neighborhood I'll for sure stop back in! I had the Cuban Sandwich and the Banana Pudding and both were delicious."}
{"text":"Worth is amazing! Love everything they have to offer. I typically get the buffalo chicken sandwich which is phenomenal but there hasn't been anything I haven't enjoyed.   Please be a ware that true to it's name, this place is best for takeaway as there's not a lot of room to sit inside. Plenty of patio seating but if it's a hot summer day just grab it and go. Definitely worth it ;)"}
{"text":"Blink and you'll miss this cute, pint-sized restaurant right in the mix in downtown Mesa. If you want to live your best sandwich life, you're going to want to make a u-turn and come back.   I'm taking the scenic route through their sandwich list and so far have had the cuban, reuben, veggie and crispy chicken. The veggie I ordered on a whim, honestly not expecting much from a protein-less sandwich, but the combinations of crunchy slaw and creamy sweet potato left me feeling satisfied and as full as another protein-centric sandwich would. I think the cuban still holds steady as my favorite. THE PICKLES. Don't get it without the pickles because that would be dumb. They make them in house and sell them by the jar and the only reason I haven't bought them is because I know that the full jar would be consumed on the car ride home.  Worth's efforts to source locally make it easy to feel good about eating there. They work with mostly local vendors for everything from their bread, coffee, and dairy (Danzeisen-if you have not had their milk, run don't walk to get some). It's a place that takes pride in being local and I love that.  The customer service is here is really great.  Kelsey always remembers my name which is a big deal to me since I frequently encounter having my name mispronounced, misspelled and am always asked \"do you have a nickname so I can remember it?\" It only took a couple of visits for Kelsey to remember my name and I always get the Norm of Cheers experience when I walk in.  Worth is a great place for a casual lunch in a cool space with some of the best service in the Phoenix metro area."}
{"text":"So delicious!  Had the crispy chicken sandwich (which is a very large sandwich) on a really good ciabatta-type roll and a cup of smoked pork chili with beans.  Everything was so fresh and perfectly executed.  I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Quality artisinal sandwiches in a clean, modern setting. I ended up liking the crispy chicken way more than I thought I would, definitely my recommendation. The house chips are fantastic, I'd recommend them as well. Quick and courteous staff. Give them a try sometime."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times, the food has been pretty good and its nice to have something in downtown mesa. Its not amazing but if your nearby its worth a stop in."}
{"text":"This restaurant has great sandwiches and salads and the owners are awesome!  The customer service is always above and beyond.  This place is a great addition to downtown Mesa."}
{"text":"Highly recommend this adorable little place that makes you feel like you stepped into San Francisco in the little dumpy town of Mesa. Lol! They are sweet, good service and great food!"}
{"text":"Fresh from panning for gold in Apache Junction, we stopped in Mesa on our way back to Scottsdale.  We were  hungry and looking to trade our treasures for good food.  At first, the wife thought we were lost, seeing only a string of car dealerships, car washes and car repair shops.  Then, a giant \"sandwich\" sign was visible on the horizon, though largely obscured by overgrown trees.  We parked the car and made our way inside what seemed like an oasis.   Free bottles of cold water!!! Kids food for $4!!!  What sort of business is this?  A fantastic one.   My wife, connoisseur of buffalo chicken sandwiches, says \"the crunchy chicken, the slaw, the sauce, the bits of blue cheese... this is the best d*** buffalo chicken sandwich I've ever had.\"  My children cannot understand how potato-y the chips are.  \"Have we always been eating potato chips?  What were those other things?\" they wonder aloud.  Satisfied, we load back into the car and spend the remainder of our trip home talking about the food from this place.  Turns out we had to pay with real dollars.  But check those cacti -- some have a little fool's gold in their jars!"}
{"text":"Owners (blonde hair lady + man) were rude when we asked them about the shop, almost like it was inconvenience to them, like who were we to ask them a question, as if we weren't good enough. (They didn't know we were standing there and could see their reaction.) You know for someone who's shop is open BECAUSE of the public supporting them you would think they would be decent human beings with a friendly attitude. The only thing that made the shop get two stars was the serving sizes and the brown haired lady who was taking the orders. Disappointed"}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast burrito. Coming back for a sandwich before I leave spring training."}
{"text":"Whether it's breakfast or lunch Worth Takeaway always exceeds my expectations. Their home made pastrami is wonderful. The home made chips are crisp and actually taste like potato chips. A great place to stop in for a delicious bite."}
{"text":"Visit here every time I am in Mesa!!!! Banana pudding is AMAZING!!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious chicken sandwiches. Not much room to eat there, so you pretty much need to get the food to go. But it is yummy and healthy. Downside is no fountain sodas, and gotta have the soda on cans. If you're a big soda drinker I'd recommend getting a Big Gulp first and taking it with you!"}
{"text":"Chicken hash, amazing. Banana pudding, life changing. Service, fast and phenomenal. I would come here often if I lived in Arizona :(. I will miss you."}
{"text":"Girlfriend and myself each ordered the crispy chicken sandwich. We don't go to downtown Mesa very often but we were blown away by the sandwiches. They were so big that we ended up splitting one and it may have been the best sandwich I've ever had."}
{"text":"I got the chicken panini and it was great! I liked the atmosphere and feel of the place but we sat outside which was nice too! Definitely would recommend if you're looking for that trendy new brunch aesthetic outing"}
{"text":"Tonight I wanted to take banana cream pudding to a friend's house. When I called to make sure plenty was available, I was told they had added a seasonal pumpkin spice flavor. I was a bit skeptical that a perfect banana cream pudding might be rendered simply good. Boy was I wrong! The pumpkin spice taste is ever so subtle. The banana cream pumpkin spice is definitely great!"}
{"text":"Small bistro style shop with great food.  First time there, and they were packed.  They messed up our order, but made up for it and gave us dessert!  Kid-friendly place too, outside patio was perfect.  They had someone outside playing music, and a VW van taking pics out front.  Great vibe, great place to hang out."}
{"text":"A quaint little sandwich shop with great food!  I had the veggie sandwich, my husband the cuban.  Both very tasty.  I had never had a veggie sandwich with sweet potatoes and I was pleasantly surprised how good it tasted. The pickled cabbage also on the sandwich made it colorful and pleasing to look at. We also ordered the potato chips and the tap root beer. YUM! We were to full to try the banana pudding which worked out fine because they ran out. Our only complaint was with ourselves...we should of shared.  We were heading to a play at the Mesa Art Center after lunch so we couldn't keep the half we didn't eat so it just ended up in the garbage.  Very Sad. :("}
{"text":"Always ALWAYS get the crispy chicken sandwich! Unless you are inclined to get a different one. They are all so good. Ask for the Simple Soda! Orange if they have it. Worth collaborates with so many local businesses it's one of the best things that has happened to the entire Phoenix area, let alone downtown Mesa. The owners and workers are awesome, the good vibes are oozing out of the walls. Don't settle for a chain when you can come here, please and thank you."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a quick lunch. A chicken sandwich.It was large,  and the ciabatta was good. I'm not sure what the breading on the chicken was, It was  salty like parmesan and crunchy fried after breading.  Ok not great.  Also had the chicken hash. A little greasy and vegetables were  al dente and under seasoned. This is a pass for us.     Seems popular to the locals though."}
{"text":"Words cannot express how amazing the food is here...I have made this my go to place for breakfast/lunch...Everything is flavorful, fresh, and mouthwatering.  I am very picky when it comes to my Cuban sandwiches...due to the pork...but Worth Takeaway...has NAILED this sandwich...and I got it on the bed of greens w/sweet potatoes...and it is still a hit...The veggie hash is to die for...This is a hidden gem...Everyone is super friendly...and the wait time is so minimal...This is more than a sandwich shop...it is EPIC!!!"}
{"text":"Have been to Worth a couple of times now and they are doing so many things right with their sourcing and food. Their owners are working so hard to bring their sandwich craft to downtown Mesa and Phoenix metro in general and they are doing very well! Have tried their buffalo chicken sandwich and it is everything you would want: locally made ciabatta by Proof bread, perfectly fried chicken breast, an abundance of blue cheese, thinly sliced carrots and celery, and a house-made buffalo sauce. Also tried their house-made fries and Simple Soda which, oh my goodness, was just perfectly pure for my not-so-sweet taste! I want more of that.   Their space is small and they get busy but that is because they are doing things right so don't use that against them!   Well worth the visit!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  The food and the decor are amazing!  The food is fresh, homemade and super tasty.  I got the crispy chicken sandwich, chips & their house pop.  Definitely worth checking out if you're in downtown Mesa.  & They've only been open for 3 Months!"}
{"text":"This place charmed the crap out of me. It's clean and quaint inside, great outdoor patio seating. The staff was all knowledgeable, amiable, and seemed to each carry a certain passion for the place. The food was so fresh and delicious - the bread especially. There are also refreshing housemade sodas with no artificial flavor, which made me feel less bad about breaking my vow to no more soda.  I ordered the spicy chicken, which was incredible and also quite massive, so definitely get your bang for your buck here. I adored everything about this place, and I'd be happy to go back!"}
{"text":"I just had lunch at Worth Takeaway - their first day open to the public - and my sandwich was delicious.  I had the grilled cheese and it was served on Fruit and Nut bread with a side of jam for dipping.  It was so good I could have eaten a second one.  My friend had the crispy chicken sandwich and said it was very good also.  I will definitely be going back. I have heard the banana pudding is to die for but didn't have a chance to taste it today."}
{"text":"I kept seeing these amazing food photos, so I had to try this place. And guess what?- THE FOOD ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE THE PICTURE!! It was a cozy, friendly cafe, almost like being on vacation in a tiny town on the way to anywhere. I had a fried chicken sandwich it was nothing like I had before. The bread was amazing! This is what small business in America looks like and tastes like."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant with amazing feel and owners. Kelsey and Joe were incredibly kind and welcoming, but of course, the best part is that their food is to unreal! My Wife and I got the chicken sandwich and banana pudding (which was divine). My wife and I like to say we are foodies and my Wife said the chicken sandwich was her favorite sandwich she has ever had! Worth Takeout for the win!! This is going to be a staple now and we are so happy they picked downtown Mesa to open their restaurant in. Don't miss out and check them out! You will not regret it!"}
{"text":"The ONLY spot open for business early Sunday morning and I'm glad they were, otherwise I may not have found this desert rose. Their cold brew is FIRE and the break burrito satisfies your every need. 6/5 stars from me!"}
{"text":"The Chicken Sandwich, Grilled Cheese, and Banana Pudding are all amazing! One of our favorites picks on UberEATS!"}
{"text":"This place was literally amazing. Went back the next day cause we couldn't stop thinking about the eggs Benedict."}
{"text":"This place was a total surprise, really great quality. I'm a vegetarian, the Veggie sandwich is fantastic. It had sweet potatoes, cabbage, and cranberries. Yum. We sat outdoors and had a really enjoyable lunch. Give this place a try."}
{"text":"I found WORTH, a gem of a place on Instagram and was lured in by the consistently beautiful images of tasty sounding food...WOW am I glad that I stopped in and finally tried it! I've been there 4 times now and have tried multiple items on the menu.  Everything I've had has been delicious, yesterday the crispy chicken sandwich (enormous!) was so yummy I could stop eating it even though I was stuffed!  The recent special of chicken and waffles was simply *incredible*, with real flavor depth and perfectly complementary components.   I am really impressed with the talent behind this place - they clearly know how to craft delicious food and it shows that they're passionate about that.  A very friendly team including the owners, whom I chatted with recently, so I keep finding excuses to detour my commute to pop in.  The place is quite small but has outdoor seating which I'll try when the weather is cooler.  I really hope that they have continued success, they're on to something brilliant with ! Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"This place is very good. It is a cute little place with inside and outside seating. I got a chicken and veggie hash. It was really good with the fresh vegetables the chicken and an egg, yummy!! Can't wait to come back and try more."}
{"text":"Love this place! Very welcoming and cozy, with a really cool atmosphere. The food is amazing. We went for breakfast and loved both of our dishes. Definitely have to try the individual milks they have, and the banana pudding."}
{"text":"We were looking for a great place for lunch and this place did not disappoint.   We ordered two chicken sandwiches and the banana pudding. The sandwiches were pretty much perfect. I'm personally not a fan of pickles so I took mine off the sandwich but I couldn't taste them after taking them off so that was all good. Though I do hear they are sweeter pickles with a milder flavor.  The banana pudding was simply out of this world. I cannot overstate how good this dessert is. Even if you don't do sandwiches like they serve here, give that dessert a try. It's life changing. Vanilla bean cream, with soft (not soggy) wafers and banana slices. So good.  The front-of-house lady was incredibly friendly and welcoming.  She brought us our dessert as soon as we finished eating without us needing to ask, she was able to answer all of our questions and get us taken care of. She even gave us an extra dessert due to me forgetting to not order pickles which she didn't need to do but I really appreciated. This place deserves every star."}
{"text":"It IS Worth every bite!!...the sandwiches here are amazing!!...they cook everything fresh and everyone really liked what they had...this is a definite stop for lunch...make sure to get the homemade potato ships with the bye sheesh dipping sauce!...I will be back!!..."}
{"text":"Great local hole-in-the-wall. Friendly service and tasty sandwiches. Had the Cuban and it was awesome."}
{"text":"Great quant little place. Not much seating. The crispy chicken sandwich was quite good, maybe a touch salty but really good. Homemade potato chips were also yummy. Our guests had the grilled cheese which came on raisin bread and had jam on the side. Delicious. I would stop by again."}
{"text":"Worth Takeaway makes delicious homemade breakfast, lunch, and dinner sandwiches! Whenever we are in the area we are eating here at least one time! If you haven't tried it, you're missing out! And the staff treat you like family!"}
{"text":"We decided to try this place after reading such good reviews on Yelp. We went for breakfast and had the poutine. It was WONDERFUL! Very filling, just the right amount. Fresh ingredients and the ice tea was very refreshing. The chef came out and gave us a free cup of their wonderful bread pudding. That was a nice surprise and it was delicious. I highly recommend this place, great attentive staff, fresh ingredients and a wonderful seating area outside to enjoy the art district. The prices are great as well for excellent quality. A++!"}
{"text":"Keep your eyes open for this little gem, if you drive too fast or walk for that matter you might very well miss this place. Their menu is quite small, the venue is very well appointed, the people are friendly and the food is delicious! I took my mum there for breakfast this morning, we both ordered the chicken veggie hash. A bed of sweet potato, Brussels sprouts and chicken topped with a fried egg. Never in my life would I thought I would order such a thing but I can tell you it was totally worth the risk. The food was wonderful! All round 5 star place!"}
{"text":"Awesome little shop. I love coming and trying each new featured sandwich that they have. If I could come here every day I would. The most recent sandwich that I had was the shrimp Po boy and it was amazing"}
{"text":"I work nearby so I went for lunch. I was supposed to have my permanent veneers by then but didn't so I had to get a salad. I couldn't risk biting into a sandwich. I took the staff recommendation of the chicken salad. You can get any sandwich except the grilled cheese over a bed of greens. It was one of the yummiest salads I've ever had. They use a nice mix of spring greens and top it with the sandwich fillings. I could tell that everything was fresh and it all had such great flavor. Some complain about the price but this isn't a Chili's or Subway where everything is processed or prepackaged. I tried some of my coworker's chips, which were very good too. I can't wait to go back and try a sandwich! The place is small as others have commented. It's not good for large groups but you can order your food to \"takeaway\". Hopefully when they've established their business, they can add more shade outside. We happened to go on a really hot day. Now that the weather has cooled, I'll be walking to Worth quite often. I love this place so far!"}
{"text":"I ordered a breakfast burrito from Uber eats and asked for no bacon and no potatoes - my burrito had potatoes in it! Inedible - I hate potatoes!"}
{"text":"Got the crispy chicken sandwich, delicious. The chips are so thinly sliced, just delightful and light. I would personally prefer a more bolder sauce, but I will still get it again and again."}
{"text":"Definitely my new favorite sandwich shop.  Fresh ingredients amazing taste prepared to perfection.  The banana putting is definitely one of the best things I've had in a very long time."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Just get whatever the special is. And banana pudding. Food and rad people who care about food will get my business every time. As a downtown Mesa resident, I want more like Worth!"}
{"text":"Awesome place. Glad they serve next door to Oro Brewery. Cubano and Crispy Chicken sandwich are great. Chips are a must too."}
{"text":"Amazing little spot. Great service and food. Clean atmosphere and a lovely patio to sit and enjoy the sunshine. Try the house chips, so simple and delicious."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what was the issue with our order but we did not like our food. It was so disappointing. My husband and I ordered chicken sandwich and the reuben sandwich. We also got a rotisserie chicken that was very good but pretty small for the price. The sandwiches were just not tasty. We both could not finish it. The reuben had too much of a vinegar flavor and the chicken had some strange stuff in it that made it hard to eat. The ingrained side by side would have been better than all together into a sandwich. I can only explain by saying the ingredients didn't mix well. The banana pudding was small, expensive and ordinary. Nothing really special about anything. We spent about $43 on dinner and couldn't even enjoy it. :(  Two+ stars for the rotisserie chicken. The rotisserie chicken saved for us or we would have been very hungry after our 35 minutes drive each way here."}
{"text":"Believe it or not, this was actually my first time dining by myself AND at @worthtakeaway wasn't as bad as I thought it'd be pictured here is a veggie sandwich filled with roasted sweet potato, dried cranberries, pickled cabbage, herbed ricotta, on sour bread. Honestly, it was soooo much better than I'd expected. The beet and sweet potato combo was surprisingly delicious. And while there weren't very many cranberries, the flavor was still prominent, but didn't overpower the sandwich. Not to mention the sourdough was perfectly crispy. The only thing is that it's on the sweeter side so if you're looking for something more savory, I'd recommend the Chicken Veggie Hash so, my final verdict is yes, it's very WORTH it"}
{"text":"I came back to Worth Takeaway a few months after my first visit - and was disappointed that they raised their prices even more. Everything is about $1 higher than a year ago. Still, the consistent high-quality of their food was something I appreciate, as well as their great customer service.  I had the cold brew with a dash of almond milk, and was pleasantly surprised as the spicy kick it had. 9/10.  Veggie Sandwich: This was good, and you can tell a lot of thought goes into choosing what goes in the sandwich. The ingredients work well together (and look pretty). 7.5/10.  Spicy Pork Sandwich: Honestly... this was disappointing. It wasn't spicy at all. It was quite bland, to be perfectly honest. It was cooked right and the ingredients were quality, but the taste was underwhelming, especially for something titled \"spicy\". There was honestly 0 spice. 5/10.  Crispy Chicken Sandwich: THE STANDOUT SANDWICH. Seriously, this was amazing and made my review 5 stars. If you are having trouble choosing what to eat off the menu, do yourself a favor and just get this one. Seriously. 10/10.  I'd come back because I am curious about trying the pudding. Unfortunately, only 1 out of the 3 sandwiches I had really wowed me. I'd get the cold brew coffee again, because the spicy kick really interested me!"}
{"text":"Had the seasonal veggie hash and am in love with this place! Perfectly cooked sweet potato chunks, chicken, fried egg, and Brussels sprouts! It was perfectly seasoned and didn't need anything added. Would give 10/10 stars if I could!"}
{"text":"Very cute place in downtown Mesa. The Buffalo chicken sandwich was excellent..what a clean crisp place."}
{"text":"Downtown Mesa needed this establishment. Great food. Great owners that pay attention to small details that make the food and your experience here perfect."}
{"text":"Banana pudding favorite thing on the menu. More of a take out place but has nice seating too.  Trendy and hipster feel.  Yogurt was unique with a strong lime flavor.  Sammy was great.  Hash was egg and perfectly cooked veggies."}
{"text":"Freshly made everything! A tasty alternative for Mesa. Looking forward to trying a rotisserie chicken for dinner."}
{"text":"Chicken salad and crispy chicken sandwiches are fantastic. Also try the grilled veggies (best sweet potatoes around) and the house made sodas.  The banana pudding is ridiculously tasty (so tasty,  in fact,  that I visit Worth at least once a month). The owners are super friendly and the call ahead/take out service is perfect for a busy lunch hour."}
{"text":"Yummy sandwiches and people that work there are Cubs fans. This place was delicious and adorable."}
{"text":"Eat here. The food was amazing, the people were even better, and the banana pudding was the best that I've ever had. I will be returning every chance I get."}
{"text":"I met a friend in Mesa for lunch and I do not know Mesa, but found this super cute spot and was not disappointed. From the Root beer on tap to the super homey feel. It was a good experience. This place can get busy really quick so it's best to grab a table before hand if you are with a group or great take out. This is a great stop if you are walking through downtown Mesa."}
{"text":"This sandwich shop is the bomb. 3 of us went and we all give it 5 stars. I had the crispy chicken sandwich and would order over and over again. Totally yummy!!"}
{"text":"An amazing small shop with great design, and even better food. The Crispy Chicken Sandwich = life. Plus, you can't leave without trying their take on Bread Pudding!"}
{"text":"This place is the real deal! Everything I had was amazing: the Cuban, the chicken veggie hash, the banana pudding, the nitro coffee, just wow! Great music, ambiance, and friendly staff too.  I just wish this place was a little closer to me in Tempe but this place is WORTH the drive. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"We stopped in here to grab some food before leaving town.  Got my daughter the peanut butter sandwich.  The bread was really great...fresh, flavorful and crunchy crust and lots of really delicious, fresh peanut butter, too!  My picky eater loved it - which is worth it's weight in gold!  The house made chips accompanied it and they were pretty good, too.  I had the cold brew latte - it has a pretty strong cinnamon taste that I didn't realize it would have and I didn't really care for that, but it was a good quality of coffee, so thumbs up.    My husband and I each got a breakfast burrito.  The potatoes were well cooked and I love that they grill it before wrapping it up.  Really large portion, too.  And it comes with a tasty, not too spicy verde sauce.   Overall, pretty good! Worth a stop for a \"to-go\" order or a lunchtime sandwich."}
{"text":"Cute little sandwich shop in downtown Mesa.  Totally surprising find.   The Reuben and the chicken salad were sandwiches of choice.  What was nice about both sandwiches was the filling was not overwhelmed by the bread. The chicken was on sourdough and the Reuben on a nice ciabatta roll.  The only suggestion I would make is ease up with the salt in the chicken salad. The salt level was pretty high and distracted from the sandwich  The house chips were a delight to eat. They were crunchy without being greasy and they were sprinkled with just the right amount of salt"}
{"text":"Welp, i'm sure this is no surprise - another 5 star review for this fabulous local sandwich shop!   I was in the Mesa area today and getting hungry so when I searched lunch on my phone, Worth was only 2 miles away!! YIPEEEEE!! I went STRAIGHT there! It has been in my bookmarks for so long but I just hadn't made it out to Mesa to try it! I was literally the happiest camper.   I ordered their roast beef sandwich and you guys - it. was. SO. dreamy. It had house made roast beef, horseradish crema, imported provolone, Steadfast Farm greens and giardiniera, served on Proof ciabatta. Can you say local love?! So many amazing local businesses are supported at Worth and that makes my heart so happy. It is also worth noting that the sandwiches are very large! I was super hungry so ate it all but could definitely be happy with a half as well. I will definitely be craving this sandwich on the regular. I also had their house made chips and those are a MUST. So yummy and salted to perfection.   I'll make a point to come more often now that i've experienced their amazingness!"}
{"text":"The sandwiches are amazing, especially the roast beef! Wish it was bigger, this place needs to become more popular. It's simple and pleasant, and the people who work there are so nice."}
{"text":"I live in Tucson but I try to eat at Worth as often as I can when visiting Mesa. Nothing beats the crispy chicken sandwich! Perfection. So happy Mesa's Main Street has such a great place."}
{"text":"The food was great (the Cuban for sure). The people were amazing. My type of place. Even though I live in Phoenix, I'll drive back out to Mesa just for this."}
{"text":"This place was amazing, really simple yet delicious food/sandwiches. Decently priced and they offer some interesting drinks. I haven't yet made it back to Worth again yet but it's on my to do list in the very near future."}
{"text":"Worth it! Flew in from indy on the early morning flight. Waiting for my daughters to come later this morning. I was interested in finding a quaint, fresh, local place for a coffee, water, and something to eat... wow! I scored big time! It's not too far from the airport and in a great area. Inside is nice and cool, outside has great shaded seating and parking was free and available on a Tuesday :-)...if your looking for a win for breakfast or lunch, this is jt.. Even a craft beer place a few stores down.  Friendly service too!"}
{"text":"We had Reubens and a Cuban. They were great. The owner is very gracious. They had run out of chips and she gave us their side salad instead which was very fresh. They have home made pickles in the Cuban. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"AHHHH!!!!MAZING!! Can't say it enough how great this place was... tempted to drive back from L.A. just for another French Dip and of course the Banana Pudding.  Great ambiance, love the indoor and outdoor seating, the service couldn't have been better."}
{"text":"Does this place need another five star review?  Well here it is.  My husband had a crispy chicken and I had the calabrian turkey.  Both really good and with a bite to the dressing.  The fattening crispy chicken was the best of the two.  Don't be shy to grab seating or you will need to eat in your car.  We will be back but this time we will share."}
{"text":"After hearing so many good things about this place, I decided to make a stop while I was driving down Main St. in Mesa. Worth Takeaway is located right next to a light rail stop not too far from the Mesa Arts Center. The restaurant itself is small and simple and has a nice clean modern feel to it. They have both indoor seating and a decent size outdoor patio area. Their menu includes breakfast items, gourmet sandwiches and rotisserie that are made with locally sourced and house-made ingredients. All their sandwiches run about $9 to $10. I went right for the Crispy Chicken sandwich. The chicken itself was pretty crispy and the sauce had a nice blend of sweet and spicy (Sriracha honey mustard) along with their house-made pickles. The sandwich was absolutely delicious and I loved every bite. The customer service was outstanding as well. I enjoyed chatting it up the gentlemen who took my order and he almost sold me on their famous homemade banana pudding I keep hearing about (I was way too full). They also sell products from other food producers like Danzeisen Dairy, The Simple Farm, Provision Coffee and Abby Lee Farms. At the ordering counter they have fresh flowers and t-shirts (and free bottled water!). Coming here was a pleasant experience for me and I'll for sure stop in again for that pudding."}
{"text":"I should've known better than to doubt Worth.  And not just because Worth fetches hundreds upon hundreds of five star Yelp reviews as of my first visit here.  I've also sampled Worth at the most recent Devour Culinary Festival and really enjoyed the samples they offered.  I'll freely admit some of my skepticism going in was tied to my general disinterest in the Mesa food scene.  Part of me genuinely wondered if Mesa residents who might be unaccustomed to great food in other parts of the valley were driving all those 5 star reviews for this place.  But on a Sunday at lunchtime, I decided to put my doubts aside and make the drive to Downtown Mesa.  Worth is accessible by car or light rail on the north side of Main Street in Downtown Mesa just east of Country Club Drive.  Jim & Kelsey Strothers' place can be easy to miss as its quite tiny.  Seating for 15 max inside and maybe another 20 outside.  Its no wonder then that this is mostly a takeout spot.  The menu is posted above the register and they'll relay the day's specials when you order up front.  I decided to dine in on a relatively quiet Sunday and researched their menu in advance of my arrival.  Worth proudly proclaims their Cuban sandwich as their proudest creation on their Yelp account, so naturally that would be my inaugural sandwich choice.  They also make their own in house potato chips so I grabbed a sack of those.  They also make an in house soda every day (today was a Watermelon & Basil soda) so I got one of those.  And lastly their only dessert option is a house made banana pudding so I ordered that as well.  Total cost for all the house made food, drink, and tax came to about $21.  For the record, Worth's Cuban sandwich shouldn't be mistaken for a truly traditional Cuban sandwich, but rather Worth's own version of it.  Here the bread is ciabatta (sourced from regional bread maker City Bakery) stuffed with havarti cheese, house made pickles, dijon mustard, mayonnaise, and lots of cured slow roasted pork.  One bite confirmed that Worth has every right to be prideful about this sandwich.  The pork is out of this world and the Ciabatta is a great vehicle for holding it all together.  The house made chips that came alongside had a dash of sea salt, but weren't greasy and cooked to a perfect crunch.  Perhaps the biggest surprise of the meal was the soda.  I don't drink soda and as such was a little uncertain as to whether I would enjoy one house made, but I was very pleasantly surprised.  The watermelon and basil combo gave the soda a slightly tart texture and the soda itself wasn't overly carbonated (in fact I barely noticed the carbonation).  The banana pudding was a nice cold creamy finisher with big chunks of bananas layered in with heavy cream and breading.  Plus it was served in a small portable portion size for one.  In addition to their lunch offerings, Worth also has some breakfast items for the morning crowd and a burger for the late afternoon crowd.  Worth also takes great pains to source all of their ingredients and beverages locally and regionally with vendors like Danzeisen Dairy, RAD Juice, Provision Coffee, and Steadfast Farm.  And now they also offer a full catering menu.   So apologies to Worth and their Mesa Yelp fans for doubting you.  It won't happen again.  At Worth the prices are fabulous, the staff are incredibly kind, and the food is outstanding.  Today's lesson?  When you're a restaurant fetching a 5 star average through more than 400 reviews on Yelp, its not a fluke.  Don't question such a Yelp phenomenon as I did.  You'll only be missing out."}
{"text":"I will drive a half hour or more out of my way to eat here!! Amazing gem of a sandwich shop, all ingredients are top quality, fresh and delicious. I've had the roast beef many times--it's that good--and husband loves the buffalo chicken. Leave room for banana pudding, it's ridiculously great. It doesn't hurt that everyone who works here is friendly and enthusiastic about what they do. If you want food with actual FLAVOR wrapped up in fabulous tasty rolls make your way to Mesa. Totally worth the trip."}
{"text":"We had the Cuban and Crispy Chicken sandwiches. Both we were wonderful. The bread pudding did not disappoint!  The staff were super friendly!"}
{"text":"Best sandwich ever! I recommend the buffalo chicken with the chocolate milk! I also had the Cuban. It's good, but doesn't beat the buffalo chicken"}
{"text":"This was a spot I found on yelp and I'm glad I did. The food is delicious and the staff woman I met was very kind and welcoming. It had a nice little casual small environment to it. The only thing you may run into is that I had trouble finding parking but I was in hurry so I didn't look that well. Still it's close to the light rail I believe so that might not be much of an issue."}
{"text":"Got here on Ramen night last monday (once a month) and hit the Shoyu Ramen (I talked to the chef - they're doing a different ramen each month - hey - when's Kitakata ramen night?  :-)).  Wow - really great - good noodles, great softboiled egg, tasty char shu pork, good broth. Only thing that would've made it better would be a spoon with the hook on the handle that keeps the spoon from going swimming in the broth  ;-)  If you're in the neighborhood on ramen night, make it a special point to go (if not, go anyway - the sandwiches are really good)."}
{"text":"Had lunch at Worth Takeaway yesterday. A bit disappointed overall.   I arrived at noon on a Wednesday and there was one other person eating. I ordered the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich and a soft drink, which came to $12.70. They should understand that $12 is too much for a sandwich.   Worth had a nice street side Cafe set up, in addition to the few tables inside. My lunch arrived in 14 minutes. Again, a big number for a lunch, especially when no one else is being served.   The sandwich looked promising, with thinly sliced veggies and a Bleu Cheese spread. The ciabatta bread looked good too. One bite changed all that: most of my fillings flew out the other side. The bread had a tough exterior and the slippery fillings didn't have a chance to hold. The breading on the chicken also slid off, making a huge mess. Even the chicken slid out.   Taste was okay, but way too heavy on veggies (sliced carrots and cabbage).   Not sure if a return visit is in the plan."}
{"text":"Everything we've tried here is above and beyond what a sandwich should be! Amazing service, they drop it off right to you at the Oro Brewing Company.  Pickles on the Cuban are just like Grammas when I was a kid."}
{"text":"Very trendy and cute location in the heart of downtown Mesa! My husband and I are in the area for a wedding and found Worth Takeaway. The location is very trendy and little touches of AZ like cactus centerpieces on the tables. The coffee is fresh and their creamer options include a house made almond/cabs she's milk. We had a chicken veggie hash which was full of flavor! The customer service was excellent. We will definitely be back to try their lunch menu."}
{"text":"THE BEST CRISPY CHICKEN I'VE EVER HAD. I usually get it as a sandwich but this time I got it as a salad and WOWZA. I got like 8 ounces of crispy chicken with the yummiest of sweet potatoes and pickles. It's now a day later and I'm going back for lunch today. You need to go here ASAP"}
{"text":"Ok, but a very limited menu and sugar and cream you have to share with other tables who are eating some things with their hands...?"}
{"text":"This is a cute tiny restaurant on Main St. The employees were very helpful, prompt and friendly.   My husband ordered the crispy chicken sandwich but it came with a sauce that tasted buffalo, so he made have received the wrong sandwich?? The sandwich and spread was very good. The bread is lan artisan bread. It was tasty although we would've preferred less bread so we could taste the ingredient throughout the entire sandwich.   I had the roast beef with horseradish sauce. The sauce was mild, not very spicy. Again, quality and flavors were all very good. I really like spicy, so I asked for a sauce of buffalo sauce to spice mine up more.   The chips are homemade, very fresh and lightly salted. We wouldn't hesitate to come back. The free water is AWESOME!!!!"}
{"text":"Tiny sandwich shop. Very clean. No RR tho.  Our sandwiches were AWESOME. Just perfect. Cuban and a Veggie. Cashier was friendly and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"This place is lovely. Everything I've tried has been amazing. Cute little patio too. :)"}
{"text":"Super delicious with very friendly staff. Portion sizes are generous. Had the Sammie and Yogurt bowl. Need to get you guys to locate to Portland."}
{"text":"Wow! Wow! Wow! Thanks to all the amazing yelp reviews, we decided to go out of our way to try it! So glad we did! The buffalo chicken and crispy chicken were absolutely to die for! Big portion and incredible flavor! House made chips and banana pudding were also great! Very friendly staff! Our new FAVORITE sandwich place!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times now and I am impressed with the quality of food they offer and the level of pride they take in their offerings. This past Friday I elected to try the rotisserie chicken to go and was glad I did.  Portion size is enough for 2-4 people however I would highly recommend getting a second order of vegetables because they are that good!  Don't forget to add a couple salads and make sure you get the banana dessert when you go.  Keep up the great work guys!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing !! The Cuban sandwich was heavenly and the Kelsey was a doll! We were at Oro brewery next door and ordered sandwiches, lime soda and the home made chips! Everything was wonderful and service was fantastic!"}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely delicious, and the owners are incredibly nice. Customer service and quality is through the roof!"}
{"text":"Yes!! This place is small, don't let that fool you. The food explodes with flavor and they use local ingredients. The owner is great and so helpful. I had the grilled cheese and omg yum. The chips are wonderful with the blue cheese dip. I'm going here again to try the next thing I want. Go here if you are in the area, you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Staff is super friendly and helpful. Thanks for the yummy and fresh food."}
{"text":"I don't give reviews often, let alone five star reviews, so this should go a long way if you're trying to determine if you should eat here. You can tell they put a lot of love in their food. High quality ingredients, clean restaurant, fun drinks and great customer service. The crispy chicken is bomb and the banana pudding is out of this world. Bonus: if you read the negative reviews on yelp the owner personally responds to each one and you can tell it's a heartfelt response. Can't ask for much more!"}
{"text":"Easy to call in a pick up order at lunch time.  Employee was friendly.  Parking on street was fairly easy.  I thought the cost for a sandwich and tea were high.  I wouldn't do it again."}
{"text":"I've been twice. First time I got the Cuban and it was really amazing. Second time I got the Buffalo chicken bowl. And housemade chips. And simple soda. And banana pudding.  And it was all pretty much the best thing I've ever had. I highly recommend.   Cool concept, nice folks, amazing food and pricing I can live with. Can Downtown mesa ask for 5 more places that offer the same level? Please?  I'll be going back for the banana pudding. And chips. And soda. And sandwiches. Seriously it's so good."}
{"text":"This was a great stop for my \"to go\" lunch today.  It was my first visit and it's a very small little quaint restaurant with all the charm you would expect for \"downtown\" Mesa.  The staff was extremely friendly and kind and everyone there seemed to give a helping hand if needed. (Their chef took my order & rang me up while another person was busy, don't worry there were additional kitchen staff working to make my order while he was helping me.)  I love that you can order a sandwich without the bread & substitute greens & roasted sweet potatoes.  That was what sold me to go, since I was craving a Ruben, but shouldn't have the grilled bread that is usually associated with that sandwich.  The greens were fresh & crisp and beautiful, the sweet potatoes were excellent and the Pastrami was delicious!  The Havarti had just the right tangy-ness to it and the sauerkraut was wonderful.  The portion size was perfect, not too much and not too little.  I was satisfied and happy with my idea to try a new spot since I work at Mesa Riverview and have limited options for types of food beyond Tempe Marketplace it's great to know this establishment is there.  I will definitely be back and am pleased to have found a new lunch \"joint\" I can go to.  Thank you Worth Takeaway, just what the area needed and we're glad to have you!"}
{"text":"The food is great the experience is better. After one day of coming in they remembered our names Taylor and Tyler. This place could have bad food and I'll still comeback. GREAT FOOD GREAT SERVICE. Definitely coming back when in AZ"}
{"text":"The food and service are always great. I love trying their sandwich special. If you prefer, they will make most items are a bowl instead. I definitely recommend their banana pudding!"}
{"text":"Super tasty food and great vibe. Definitely try the seasonal soda! Will come back again!"}
{"text":"This place is smaller than a hole in the wall but the food is large as life. I ordered the special of braised short rib, potato/parsnip puree and carrots. It was all well-seasoned and tasted delicious. Roots were not over cooked - just slightly al dente and they had a sugary glaze. The puree was heavenly but the star was the short rib - tender and juicy.   Yes it is all served in a plastic container with plasticware, but the flavor is fine dining. I was totally blown away that a sandwich shop made such great food. And their banana pudding was like mother made - vanilla wafers and perfect banana slices! It was Worth it!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best spots in downtown Mesa! The restaurant is super cute, and the food was great. If you like fresh and local ingredients, you have to try Worth :) everyone working was super friendly, you can tell they truly care about you having a good experience. I love that they always have different sandwiches on special, they do such cool collaborations with other local vendors!   If you're thirsty, they actually provide water bottles for free, too. It's crazy how rare that is these days :)"}
{"text":"Rating this place was pretty hard to be honest.. I almost gave \"worth takeaway\" 2/3 stars but I decided to give them 4 and here is why..  I was in the area and decided to try this place out since I notice that it had so many good reviews. I wasn't sure what to expect from the food or the place do to their prices. Once I walked in I was greeted by one of their employees and she was definitely friendly, the place definitely had a cozy vibe, the inside is not very big but they spaced it out pretty well, they also have an outdoor seating area which is really cool and both inside and outside were definitely clean. They do offer you a complementary water with a purchase I believe so that's a plus.   Looking over the menu I notice that there wasn't a huge selection but The options were definitely there, since it was breakfast when I went in and i really enjoy breakfast and sandwiches I decided to try the Pastrami Croque Madame; now again due to the price($9.75) I wasn't sure what to expect from the sandwich.. also just to try out at least two of their sandwiches so I could get a better gauge of their food and taste between prices I also ordered the breakfast Sammy which is roughly around $3.50 I believe.  Now to the food.. this is the reason why i was going to give them only 3 stars..   Both sandwiches took right about 15+ minutes to come out to the table and I pretty much the only one there.   1st sandwich up... Pastrami Croque Madame: it comes with bechamel, pastrami, aged white cheddar, dijonnaise served on sourdough; baked and topped with an over easy egg. - i was so Excited for this sandwich but it really failed and the sandwich really only looked nice.. the Pastrami was kinda cold and not really cooked which is weird due to the time they took to make it and the bread really did not taste baked and when it comes to sourdough you can really taste the difference.... so it just made the whole sandwich feel undercooked and the whole thing  just ended up having an odd taste to it.. I ended up just eating half of the sandwich...   Now for the winner of the food and the reason why I could give them back a star is sandwich #2...   Breakfast Sammy: comes English muffin, aged cheddar, sriracha aioli and a friend egg.  It's super simple and it tasted good the English muffin was toasted on the outside and it had a crisp taste to it on the inside, the aged cheddar and the sriracha aioli mixed amazing with the muffin and egg. Man I scarfed the whole thing down hahah it's also a surprise due to the cost of this sandwich.   Over all it was not a super bad experience the employee, cleanliness and the breakfast sammy made up for it. Hah My stomach was turning a bit after I ate the madame but eh.   Do I think the place is nice... yes it's definitely nice. I understand the prices are probably high for a reason but if you are playing the Quality versus the quantity factor then you have to make sure that your quality is ALWAYS up there with the taste of the food as well. I guess going simple on the food is not always a bad thing.   THE END.."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in downtown Mesa. Great spot for an early morning weekend breakfast. My wife and I really enjoy the food and especially enjoy the outside dining area and the view of quiet (weekend) downtown Mesa Main Street.   The menu seems to be ever changing with specials that keep you wondering what are they going to do next. Parking and seating is very limited, hence the restaurant name, but worth it."}
{"text":"Recently came here to grab a bite to eat and was pleasantly surprised.  I had the roast beef sandwich, my husband had the buffalo chicken and we split some chips.  The flavor was great and I loved the pickled onions and carrots.   The server was helpful and informative and I thought that it was awesome that their water bottles are free.  My only gripe is that it's far too small to sit in and relax if it's even a tiny bit busy. However, the food really was great so we'll definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I had the nitro cold brew which was deliciously frothy! Definitely gave me a jolt, too :)  I had the grilled cheese for lunch and my goodness was it worth every cent. I had to remind myself to come up for air between bites! I was skeptical of the jam dip but it was absolutely perfect. Do not pass up this sandwich!"}
{"text":"WOW!! What a lovely and delicious surprise!! We tried Worth for the first time and everything about our experience was 5 Star! The interior is cool and comfortable and they have outdoor patio seating as well! We ordered the crispy chicken sandwich and a bag of their homemade chips. The sandwich is served on a very fresh crispy and chewy ciabatta roll. The chicken was indeed crispy and very flavorful! They make their pickles in house...you can tell they are not from a jar! The owner was super nice! I want to try all of their sandwiches!! Thank you fellow Yelpers for your great recommendation!!  I highly recommend Worth Take Away :)"}
{"text":"Their website says \"we want to be the Cheers of sandwiches\" and goes on to talk about community. The staff is friendly, the food is incredible, and you can feel that sense of community here! Last night was my first time and definitely won't be my last. I am usually not a sandwich fan, but I could eat the crispy chicken sandwich every day. And the banana pudding (again, not something I usually like) is to die for!"}
{"text":"I had the chicken veggie hash and it was amazing! Very pretty interior decor, very friendly staff and delicious food. It's a little gem in Downton Mesa!"}
{"text":"Every dish is made with lots of love and care. The way each ingredient is put together is well thought out. Mesa doesn't have much going on but this is definitely the new hot spot in town. The fried chicken sandwich was amazing. The chicken was some of the best fried chicken breast I've ever had. The pickles in the sandwich were like wow! The banana pudding is a must. Don't leave here without ordering one. Mesa's gem is here at Worth Takeaway!   Recommendation: Fried chicken sandwich and banana pudding"}
{"text":"I couldn't pass up a 5 star rating. Sure enough it was that good. Maybe the best Chicken sandwhich I've had."}
{"text":"All I want to do is eat here everyday. The crispy chicken sandwich is phenomenal, my husband nearly cried tears of joy while eating his Cuban sandwich, we fought over the bag of chips (we will not be sharing them again), and left with a banana pudding to go... which didn't even last the car ride home.   A perfectly curated and simple menu matches the clean and stylish aesthetic of the shop itself. You can tell everything here is done with intention and thoughtfulness. The owners Jim Bob and Kelsey are so kind and really cool. They not only make you feel welcome, but like you're their good friends.   It feels good to support a local business like Worth Takeaway. Can't wait to come back and try everything else on the menu!"}
{"text":"Thank you yelp for being spot on in finding an excellent place to eat and grab a sandwich.  I ordered the roast beef sandwich.  They use good quality bread and ingredients.  Everything tasted fresh and delicious.   I highly recommend checking this place out. Service was super friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"My favorite sandwich in Phoenix!! The owners are so rad, the vibe is right and food is amazing! I come by every time I'm in town! The crispy chicken sandwich is what dreams are made of!"}
{"text":"HEAVEN !  This place makes sandwich masterpieces. The chicken salad sandwich is one of a kind. I took my family here when they visited me and they still talk about how good every bite of each sandwich was."}
{"text":"The chicken sandwich is just as good as everyone says.  I could eat it every day.  While they have a relatively small menu, they do a great job of featuring new stuff all the time.  Mesa should be proud to have this place."}
{"text":"Wow this place is delicious! I came for a late breakfast, the woman at the counter was very friendly and helpful. I ordered the pastrami croque and it was perfection! They use good quality bread, the egg was perfectly cooked and still had a slightly runny yolk. I haven't tried the other sandwiches on the menu but I will be back for more yummy food!"}
{"text":"Fantastic! Got the roast beef sandwich. Fresh ingredients, fresh bread, great flavor. Just a great sandwich! Good size as well."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Friendly service, delicious, fresh and fast sandwiches. My mom had the roasted chicken salad sandwich and really enjoyed the combo of olives and apples in the mix. I had the veggie, a tasty combo of sweet potato, cranberries, herbed cream cheese and pickled cabbage. The bread pudding was fabulous."}
{"text":"Yummy nummy sammiches with delightful and speedy service. They also deliver to nearby Oro Brewing Company on Main Street if you'd like some great grub to go with your brewski. Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Amazing sandwich.   Food is fresh and prepared to order.  The home made chips were delicious.  Friendly service.  Clean environment.  Will definitely come back when we are In the area.  The"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The people who work here are so friendly and funny. My son and I stopped in for the breakfast sandwich and it was PERFECT. So simple but completely delicious. The coffee is also great. I only wish they had more variety for breakfast."}
{"text":"I have heard a lot of good about this food so I took my husband to try it.  Pretty limited menu and I wasn't drooling over anything as I read it but got a crispy chicken sandwich.  It was SO GOOD.  Yum.  I loved the combo of flavors.  My husband sandwich was good too.  Goes to show how important quality is both with ingredients and the actual menu.  Pleasantly surprised"}
{"text":"Wow! What more can I say? They would be much busier if you could actually find the place. But I digress. Stopped in for lunch with some friends and had the Buffalo Chicken on ciabatta. Wow! The flavors were explosive. Tender and juicy and crispy. And they had a specialty drink on tap that was amazing. I wasn't going to drink soda on this trip, but when they offered me a sample I knew I needed to have the soda."}
{"text":"I concur with the amazing reviews! I was with a group of six and everyone really liked their food. I had the chicken salad over greens and sweet potatoes. It was SO GOOD!! And a generous portion. I tried others- crispy chicken (yummy!), house made potato chips, and banana pudding. All fabulous! Great service and friendly people. We'll be back --- we had to sit outside and it's still too warm, especially when walking."}
{"text":"The sandwich (Ruben) that I had was so good. I can't say enough about it. The owner was there and she was super nice. I would recommend here for a causal meet up or to take your girl for a new place."}
{"text":"First time eating here and after paying for the sandwiches and drinks we sat down and I told my wife \"this better be good because $30 for 2 sandwiches and a few cans of coke is not cheap\".  Then the sandwiches came out (buffalo chicken and the chicken salad sandwich) and HOLY COW they were so GOOD!!  This is definitely some of the best sandwiches I've ever Ate!!"}
{"text":"Great food and all fresh. Love that they use local products! They also had great customer service. The only complaint would be it was $40 for lunch for 2 people. This is really pricey for sandwiches."}
{"text":"6 Stars. If you're thinking about coming here. Just do it! I have heard good things and seen the amazing reviews but something was holding us back from going to Worth. Once we arrived we could see it's super small inside which did throw us for a loop but after 5 minutes we adjusted and everyone eating there was friendly! The owner was there taking to a friend about expanding (gosh I hope they do!). We ordered the breakfast burrito, two words, FREAKING DELICIOUS! We also ordered the fried chicken sandwich, two more words, ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS. The chicken was cooked perfectly, the outside was flavorful and crunched like no other! We of course ordered the banana pudding. DO NOT pass up the banana pudding, DO NOT! I almost went back today. Maybe I'll go tomorrow because my mouth is now watering. Love small, local, family owned places, way to go Worth Takeaway, you're so worthy."}
{"text":"Perfect find for a Saturday breakfast. My chicken sweet potato hash was scrumptious. Nice owners, great location. It's a winner, hope more like it come to downtown Mesa."}
{"text":"Don't walk.  Run!  The Five Stars on Yelp are sooooo deserving!  I was a bit skeptical of the elusive \"perfect score\" and had to see for myself, so I paid a visit.  The interior is small and intimate with minimalist decor.  One thing that did catch my eye was the collection of posters, sort of a tribute to local architects.  Very cool!  The service was fast and friendly.  Minutes later, with sandwich in hand, I headed for the outdoor patio, a nice option for a fair weather evening.  I bit into the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich and then, it happened.  The stars aligned, birds began to chirp and angels in heaven began to sing.  Imagine thick, juicy chicken breast with just the right amount of Buffalo sauce.  A flavorful blue cheese spread which didn't overpower the overall flavor of the sammy.  Just the right amount of crispy carrot / celery slaw.  (And I don't even like celery!). It was all held together on a chewy Proof ciabatta roll.  I was tempted to go back for seconds, but given the large portion, didn't need to.  Ahhh, there IS a heaven!"}
{"text":"Found this gem through UberEats... AMAZING! I wish they had a larger menu of more deliciousness!  I tried the Iconic Cocktail Spiced Honey Cold Brew Latte... a nice change from my coffee chain norm.  For our meal, we ordered the crispy chicken and buffalo chicken sandwiches.  The chicken breast is lightly breaded & fried, and the bread is SO fresh and delicious.  House made pickles were YUM!  I added the bread pudding to the order (because why not?) and I did not regret it.  Will definitely order again, and will try to visit in person to check out the restaurant."}
{"text":"I ate food from here twice To-Go before writing this review of Worth Takeaway to see if traffic played a role in the flavor of Buffalo Chicken sandwich. It did and just like In an out the quicker I was able to eat the sandwich the better it tasted. Buffalo chicken sandwich texture is excellent,  Flavor is tasty but slightly salty on some bites and perfect on others when vegtables counter the bleu cheese and Buffalo sauce. Seasoned fries are delicious and perfect in texture and flavor . Banana pudding with butterfinger is my favorite thing so far and tastes delicious with a creamy yet caramel flavor and great texture. Staff is friendly and professional getting the order down perfectly.  The restaurant is clean and neat with some unique art and decor.  Service:5/5 Fries: 5/5 Buffalo Chicken: 4/5 Banana pudding: 5/5 and my favorite thing here!  I will return and try more sandwiches which I see others enjoy! I recommend Worth Takeaway if you are in the area, and if you get to go get home and eat it quickly!"}
{"text":"We tried this quaint shop today and it was AHHH-MAZING! Tried the Ruben sandwich, Cuban sandwich, home-made chips, cold brew coffee & the rosemary lemon soda. My fav was the Ruben (homemade saurkraut to die for and pastrami that melts in ur mouth)and cold brew coffee...along with the awesome girls who were working. My dghtr's fav was the soda. Nice chilled vibe and small. Def will be in our eating out rotation!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to grab a good breakfast or lunch. It's nice seeing some good restaurants come back to Downtown Mesa. Their dog friendly patio is a nice touch as well!"}
{"text":"Pretty good little hipster joint.   I had the chicken sandwich and it was delicious. I did take out for lunch as I work down the street.   I would recommend this to anyone looking for a specialty sandwich!   The place is rather small and I'm not sure how busy it gets."}
{"text":"I couldn't resist trying out Worth Takeaway after seeing so many 5 star yelp reviews!  So, we ventured to Main Street in Downtown Mesa on a Thursday evening ...   It's a very charming little sandwich spot ... It's a pretty chill vibe inside nothing too fancy although I did notice a foul smell when inside ... Perhaps it was the out of order bathroom that reeked a bit?  Not really sure on that one...   The menu is quite simple and they offer a fair variety of items to choose from.  The gentleman that took our order was kind, courteous, and brought our food out to us on the patio promptly.  We tried a rueben, buffalo chicken, a beer cheese soup, and a house made pineapple beverage.  From an aesthetic perspective the food looked great - very colorful and amazing bread (I almost felt like the bread overpowered the entire sandwich though) but the sandwiches were quite tasty, but to be brutally honest the food was good, but there was nothing exceptional about it.  The soup and their house made pineapple juice drink were probably the coolest most unique items that I tried.  It does have a cute little patio outside - it was nice to relax in while eating our sandwiches when the street lights on Main Street came on ...  I rated this spot a solid 3 stars, it was pretty decent food, but overall the whole experience was just okay for me and definitely fell short of totally awesome... I would encourage others to stop by here and check it out.  The price point was a bit too high @ nearly $10 per sandwich without a side item and $6.00 for a large soup also seems a bit on the high side in relation to the quality/ quantity of food you get.  I would come back if I was in the area, but I don't see myself going out of my way to make a return visit."}
{"text":"I really love their customer service. I've been here in person and ordered thru UberEats. If I need to add something to my delivery order I just call in within 5 minutes of ordering and ask to have my delivery modified on their end. Piece of cake.  You can enjoy your food and drinks inside or outside and the light rail station is right outside."}
{"text":"I was so pleasantly surprised when I sales into Worth! It wAs so lovely. The owner Kelsey was there and so extremely helpful and nice. The decor was so chic and clean! A bit of a small location, but so quaint! I got the crispy chicken, in a bed of lettuce, and it was perfect. The chicken was juicy and the Siracha dressing had the perfect kick without being spicy. They also sold me on the Rosemary lemonade, it was just perfect for a hot Arizona day!  And to top it all of, the banana pudding! It was a piece of Magnolia Bakery here in AZ, but with a different spin! I liked! I'll be back to try more, including the root beer on tap (the only way to have root beer)!"}
{"text":"Wonderful service and food. I love their crispy chicken sandwich. I also enjoy their buffalo chicken sandwich. Great place to have a quick bite when you are in Mesa."}
{"text":"Worth Takeaway is a small sandwich shop in downtown Mesa. It has seating inside and outside. However, most people want to stay inside due to the heat and it makes the place a little crowded. I highly recommend their chicken salad sandwich and cripsy chicken sandwich. I have heard the Reuben sandwich is also good. I went at 11:30 and it was fairly packed. It got more packed closer to 12pm, but most people in line got it to go. Worth Takeaway is also known for their home brewed sodas, which are delicious!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast in mesa hands down! Whatever their special of the day is just get it! Everything is on point!"}
{"text":"I've tried nearly every sandwich on the menu and I can say it is definitely WORTH it! Each one has been even better than the last.   Worth pays extra attention to quality ingredients and owners are super nice. Each and every visit, I have been greeted by employees that are welcoming and take the time to make sure each guest leaves happy.   The delicious sea salt potato chips are made in-house. As is, the pickles and seasonal jam. For what Worth doesn't made in-house, they have teamed up with local places like Proof, Danzenisen Dairy, and Steadfast Farm. Sending localists over the moon from all the AZ love fest happening in just one spot.   Whether, it is for an awesome morning start with a tasty Breakfast Sammy, to amazing lunch with a unique twists on classic sandwiches like Crispy Chicken and Grilled Cheese or an evening snack of yummy homemade Bread Pudding for dessert, Worth Takeaway is a great option any time of day!   At the start of the new year, Worth added new menu items so looks like I'll be back to try even more!"}
{"text":"Visiting Mesa and wanted a local place for breakfast and stumbled across this jewel.  The service was amazing for such a small place. Food was outstanding and prices very reasonable. Loved the Chicken Veggie hash. Wish I would have ordered a second to go for later.   Wish we lived close by. Mesa is lucky to have such a \"local\" relaxing place to enjoy great food."}
{"text":"Top notch. Really. The banana pudding was perfect with that little sprinkle of salt on top. Roast beef sandwich was flavorful and not over the top but high quality. My friends had one of the breakfast sandwiches and the crispy chicken sandwich which they both were over the moon about. I live in Phoenix and this is definitely a place I would go out of my way for. Truly, just delicious and great quality. The girl who took our orders and brought our food was an absolute sweetheart and clearly cared about providing a great service. The tea was a last second choice when considering drinks and I was not disappointed. Will be back."}
{"text":"Literally the best sandwiches in AZ. Hands Down. Bring on more locations in the Valley. You guys are nailing it."}
{"text":"You know, I always thought a sandwich was just a sandwich...until I ate at Worth. They make sandwiches fit for the gods (and goddesses). Unique and artfully prepared. I like the fish and chicken sandwiches, and my dining partner-in-crime swears by both the pastrami and beef selections. They're ALL good! And don't even get me started on the house made chips and sodas. I'm not completely certain, but I think I want to live here."}
{"text":"This local spot has been on my list to try a while, but unfortunately live on the other side of town so when I was finally in the area I couldn't wait to visit and it did not disappoint. Staff is very helpful and friendly in helping you choose since everything sounds delicious. Prices are responsible and food wash delicious and fresh. The soup is excellent as well and I know I'll be craving it next time I get sick. Can't wait to be back in the area to try again, hope that they open more locations!"}
{"text":"The freshest bread I've had in a sandwich! The most delicious blend of flavors in my choice of a French Dip Sandwich! The most friendly service ever! WORTH every bite!"}
{"text":"Cool trendy restaurant that downtown Mesa needed.  The menu is unique and I will try everything.  Got the grilled cheese on nut bread with the jam dip.  (yes I am a little kid still).  It's really hard to make a bad grilled cheese but this one is a notch above the rest!"}
{"text":"Pleasant lunch today!!!! The hand crafted soda was to good!!! All staff very pleasant and friendly.. good job guys , now I see why you got five stars"}
{"text":"Ambiance: Small, modern-mom n' pop style cafe right on Main Street in downtown Mesa. Approximately 5 tables inside and a bar sitting as well. Gated-patio outside has 5 shaded tables which allows you to take in a little bit of city life as you eat. Patrons all ages and backgrounds but lean toward the health-conscious crowd.  Food:  Excellently prepared sandwiches with variety of novel ingredients that you wouldn't expect to be in a sandwich. The chicken salad sandwich has green olives and pickled apple slaw....it was AWESOME. Haven't tried there breakfast yet but will the next time I'm here.  Price: On the expensive side for Mesa but appropriate for the culinary expertise your getting. Most sandwiches in the 9-10 dollar range.  Service: Everyone was friendly and welcoming. Food was served promptly even in the middle of the lunch hour.  General: A cool little place in Mesa to stop in for a unique great tasting sandwich. A great addition to Mesa!"}
{"text":"Had the special this morning. The C2-B2 Crispy Chicken Breakfast Biscuit! It's a wonderful cheese biscuit with a large, crispy chicken breast. There's 3x Sriracha spreads: aioli, butter and honey in there. This is the best breakfast sandwich I've ever had.   In a past visit, the Buffalo Chicken sandwich was also excellent. Definitely an artisan approach where quality matters."}
{"text":"I was in the area and found this place on Yelp. So glad I did! I got the chicken salad sandwich. Super unique take on a lunchtime classic. Pickled veggies with blue cheese crumbles take your taste buds on an unexpected journey. Over the top description worthy."}
{"text":"This is such a cute little restaurant! We've lived less than ten minutes from here for almost two years and finally made it over here - it's definitely one of the coolest spots nearby. The staff were SO nice and friendly too! They have a super cute little patio outside too, I would love to come back here when it's not so hot so we can sit outside.   After we went here, we walked a few stores down to Oro Brewing Co., and while we were in there the woman from Worth came to deliver sandwiches to some other people in the bar. She stopped to tell us that you can get food delivered there while you're drinking beer! So it's really cool you can do that, and I thought it was really sweet of her to stop and tell us about it! :)"}
{"text":"I ordered the Sammy, small English muffin/ egg and cheese sandwich, perfect for those that want a small bite and a delicious one! We also ordered the breakfast burrito.  It is huge, bring your hunger! So scrumpdeli-ishus!!"}
{"text":"Oh my yumminess! Our first time here..   Sandwiches are incredible!  The crispy chicken with the siracha honey and house made pickles is simply amazing.  Service was outstanding. We live like 30 minutes away, but for sure will be back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped by yesterday afternoon after reading the yelp reviews.  There is nothing fancy about the inside and it is small, but it has a nice outdoor seating area that we would have taken advantage of except for this time of year it is a bit hot.  The menu is small but the sandwiches have some creative combinations of toppings and both were delicious.  I had the chicken salad which was not your typical chicken salad, it had rotisserie chicken, olives and other toppings on an artisan bread - delicious.  My husband had the crispy chicken sandwich and loved it as well.  We tried the homemade watermelon lime soda, also very creative and refreshing.    We saw one of the employees walk out with a tray of food and come back a bit later - it wasn't until reading more of the reviews today that we learned you can go to the brewery a few doors down and have them deliver there while you drink your beer.  Next time there is a good possibility we will do that, but I'm glad we got to try the homemade soda regardless.  With regard to the complaints about price from other reviewers, I get it, but if you want something a bit different with quality ingredients and not your run of the mill sandwich it is a great place to go.  If we lived closer we would be back more often."}
{"text":"I had a Cuban salad, the pork was so delicious, savory with awesome flavor, came with juicy pickles, sweet potatoe and cheese. It was so delicious definitely a great place"}
{"text":"This business has the most friendly atmosphere and the best sandwiches. Highly recommend the Cuban and the grilled cheese. There iced tea is super tasty as well."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely amazing. The staff was super friendly even though we were walking in closer to close than I would have liked. I went with my parents and everything we had was delicious!  I got the buffalo chicken and usually expect ciabatta sandwiches to be tiny but these were HUGE, full size sammies with an entire crispy chicken breast on there. Fresh celery and carrot slaw with a perfect amount of blue cheese and buffalo sauce made this a perfect sandwich. My dad got the grilled cheese and added pastrami to it which was incredible (possible special idea??) with the cherry, oat bread and jelly that came with it. My mom got the Ruben which wasn't quite my style, I felt like something was off having it on ciabatta rather than rye, but to each his own and was still really good. The banana pudding desert is something to dream over and would stop by if that is all you had to offer. I will definitely be back the next time I am in the mesa area and will highly recommend to everyone.   PS. To all of the low star reviews complaining about the price, please realize that the days of the 5 dollar footlong are gone and that for 10 bucks you are getting food that is actually cooked and prepared with passion rather than some cold cuts thrown together on a hoagie bun. Quit complaining and enjoy the fact that we now are getting back to a time where we can eat real food."}
{"text":"New favorite lunch spot in downtown Mesa! The neatest and cleanest little hole in the wall with a small scratch-kitchen sandwich menu complete with locally sourced ingredients!   Here we have the super satisfying Crispy Chicken sandwich (the gateway sandwich) with homemade sea salt potato chips, a dark cold brew with a splash of homemade cashew almond milk and a refreshing rosemary lemonade!   We will definitely be back soon! Love the amazing food, the awesome drinks and the fantastic friendly service!"}
{"text":"Small clean simple sandwich shop.  Breakfast is great. Pastrami Croque Madam is excellent."}
{"text":"I was over at Oro brewery next door. So I actually never went into the store. They deliver and bring it right over here to the brewery, which is nice of them.   Saw the high reviews of this place and I knew about it before I went to the brewery. Was looking forward to tasting this place.  I ordered the roast beef sandwich. Took a little bit of waiting, but it came.   Super delicious!  Juicy, fresh roast beef done just right. Combined with the horseradish crema, provolone, greens all squished in between a cold cut ciabatta.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it. Just a good mixture of flavor, nothing overpowering, but a burst of everything in your mouth when you bite into it.  Not sure if I was starving that night, or was it that good?  I Devourer the entire sandwich without hesitation.  Price $9.75. definitely on the more expensive side, but you get the fresh meat and ingredients. Definitely quality at this place for the price.  Would like to come back and try all their other sandwiches. This one is the list for a second look.   Come try it."}
{"text":"Worth issssss so worth it. Yea yea it is on the expensive side but it is worth every penny. I got the fried chicken sandwich and it was just as good as I could imagine. I got a side of their potato chips which were awesome and you shall leave with a cup of their banana pudding or you're wasting your life not having any fun. I mean it! Just a few days later a friend of mine went too and we talked about how we had both wanted to go for such a long time and somehow we both ended up here on the same week! The force was too strong, we had to get with the good stuff! If you're a fried chicken sandwich type of person, do yourself a favor and grab you one. They are incredibly filling."}
{"text":"Arrived for lunch at 11:15, before the lunch rush.  Ordered a Reuben and a grilled cheese.  Sandwiches arrived 20 minutes later.  Not good when you are on a lunch break.    Reuben was non-traditional, which is fine, but it was not an improvement over a traditional Reuben.  Grilled cheese was served burnt.  Not slightly overdone, mind you, but blackened and hard as a rock.  I would have been embarrassed to serve it."}
{"text":"Whoa! Custom soda!! Custom beverages!! Sweet! Great friendly atmosphere. A little rustic fresh made hole in the wall. I found this restaurant on uber eats for lunch.. And now I'm back in the actual restaurant. Love this place for the buffalo chicken sandwich.  Add the root beer delicious"}
{"text":"The crispy chicken sandwich is everything.  It was here that my husband started his love affair with Danzeisen milk. We ate, no licked every last morsel of the banana pudding.  You guys, it really is that good."}
{"text":"The crispy chicken sandwich made me question all food I've previously eaten to this point in my life. I might name my next child after the banana pudding. It's that good. But for real, 10 out of 10."}
{"text":"The food and service are AMAZING!! I have had their sandwiches with the bun and sweet potato style. They are delicious both ways!"}
{"text":"My extended family went here in April and so, when they came back for July 4th, they asked to go there again.  And they ordered everything from the Reuben, through Cuban, down to the Grilled Cheese.  Everything was fresh and delicious, including the house made sea salt potato chips.  We topped it off with their special banana pudding -- sort of like a pie in a cup.  Grilled cheese is something I could never bring myself to spend money on in a restaurant, but this one was worth every penny -- havarti and cheddar on fruit and nut bread and served with homemade blackberry jam.  There is a children's menu and the kids gobbled up the crisp chicken strips.    Unfortunately, they don't have a soda fountain, so those come in the can.  However, Worth does make its own soda, which varies from month to month.  Ask for a sample first.  In April we loved the berry soda, but this time it was watermelon.  Somewhat refreshing for the adults, but the kids all puckered their faces.   The small restaurant has one large table and 6-8 counter seats, with a few tables outdoors. Be sure to check out the very interesting mural on the entire outside wall of the building."}
{"text":"I like Cuban sandwiches so much that I have considered traveling to Cuba, so I was pretty excited to see a Cuban on the menu. The sandwich was amazing! Perfect bread (they buy from a local artisan baker), savory, tender pork, a magical combination of flavors from the pickles and cheese. This is a sandwich that is worth (pardon the pun) a drive to downtown Mesa. Jim Bob and Kelsey are gracious hosts who made us feel welcome and special (despite the craziness of the first day!) and they have done a great job on the space. It's cozy, hip and the perfect place to get a sandwich."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!! Get the crispy chicken sandwich. SO GOOD!!! You won't be disappointed. The lime soda is also excellent and refreshing. I'm from UT and plan on eating here every time I come to Mesa now. WOW."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is fresh and homemade, not pre-made items thrown together. The cold brew coffee drink is excellent and they make their own cashew almond milk! I will definitely be back to try other menu items as they all look delicious. It's exciting to see such an amazing local (and hip) restaurant in downtown Mesa."}
{"text":"Breakfast, lunch or even dinner brought over while at Oro Brewing co. It's all a win! Haven't had anything I didn't like!"}
{"text":"This place makes the best sandwiches!! I didn't personally go to their location, but the company I work for (Larry John Wright Inc.) had them cater our Halloween Lunch for about 40+ people - They delivered all the delicious sandwiches and desert on-time and very fresh. The only bummer is they had too many choice and I couldn't try them all :-( I will have to make a stop in Downtown Mesa and try some more! Everybody in the office were raving about how good the sandwiches were - Great Job!!"}
{"text":"It's places like this that make me want to spend more time in downtown Mesa. Easy to find location on Main St with plenty of street parking right in front. The place itself is tiny! From the pictures I saw I thought it would be a lot bigger. I was going to order the veggie and at the last minute went for the Cuban. Omg I'm so glad I did. It had pulled pork, harvarti and sweet and spicy pickles on ciabatta bread. I devoured it in a 5 minutes. You can just tell it's good quality food. And from what I hear they use local ingredients. I only wish that their sandwiches came with a side. One of my pet peeves is when you have to pay for a side to come with a sandwich or burger. The sandwich itself was on the pricey side as well at $9.  The one thing that I really didn't like about the experience was that the restaurant itself was soo hot. It was about 110 outside today and when I went inside hoping to cool off it was hot, stuffy and humid. I was planning on eating there but immediately asked for my food to go. I'm not sure if that's how it always is in there but if it is I think I'm going to have to wait until it cools off to go back."}
{"text":"Good food, we really liked the crispy chicken sandwich. The service was great too.  It is really small inside so you're forced to take it to go in the summer unless you get lucky and the table is open. I don't think we'll go back unless it's winter or they move to a bigger location."}
{"text":"Really good Ruben sandwich. Need to go back to try the banana pudding it sounds like a must have!"}
{"text":"Such a little gem! Was working in Mesa and found this place on yelp!  Super cute, very small, but very welcoming. We had the veggie sandwich, the pickled cabbage was amazing, the reuben, different than other rueben's but the sauerkraut was delish and homemade. Wr got chips w our sandwhich and holy cow, so good! fresh made. Kelsey gave us a blue cheese sauce to dip the chips in and it was so amazing. Not too strong, had chives in it, seriously amazing. We also got the house made lemon rosemary soda and it was so refreshing. The produce and sauces are locally sourced. Milk is from a local dairy. Seriously, stop by. I heard the banana pudding is worth a try, but I had no room after half a sandwich. Such a great spot! Their brunch looked equally as amazing. Fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"So delicious! The crispy chicken sandwhich is the best sandwich - so savory! I'm also obessed with their banana bread pudding. Staff is always curious when busy and they go out of their way to make sure you are happy with your order. Love supporting small local businesses."}
{"text":"I was in town, looking to grab a bite and found this place.  At the time it had 378 reviews and all 5 stars! I couldn't believe it and was skeptical so I had to try it out and boy it really delivered! The Crispy Chicken was delicious; the sauce that was on the sandwich was to die for!"}
{"text":"This cool sandwich spot left a good first impression. We both had the crispy (fried) chicken sandwich which really hit the spot, even on a hot day. I didn't see that they had a drink menu until after I ordered but it looked extensive. No signage made it hard to find which makes no sense when paying rent on busy Main Street."}
{"text":"Honestly, you'd be hard-set to find a better place in Mesa for a great sandwich! Since Anthony has taken over the menu and sandwich design, there isn't a sandwich I haven't tried that I haven't loved!   The bread has a great texture/chew and every sandwich is flavored to perfection. The most recent sandwich I had was the bahn mi - the pork was incredibly seasoned with the best pickled slaw melody I've ever had! My go-to is their french dip (YUM!). Go. Eat. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I eat here a few times a week due to the proximity to my office. The Rueben is the best I've had. Today I tried their yogurt parfait with homemade granola and it was fantastic. Their tea is great as well."}
{"text":"Go here!!! You will not be disappointed! Simple menu that supports local businesses. So good and delicious. You get what you pay for in life. There are things in life worth paying extra for: a good pair of jeans, Apple products, high-thread count bed sheets!   These sandwiches are of the highest thread-count Egyptian cotton sheets of the food world. Well worth the extra $2 in comparison to other sandwich shops. I'd pay double for that Cuban sandwich any day!   Plus you can get a free bottle of water. That might change, but for now, it's the cherry on top.  PLUS! (Yes, there's even more) the people there are so nice and inviting and chill. You feel like they are your best friends when you walk in. Super cool people!  Feel good about what you eat by supporting a downtown Mesa restaurant. They use a local baker and just help improve Mesa."}
{"text":"Never heard about this place till I saw them on the IG @bestfoodphoenix then decided to check on the reviews and was saw the raving reviews and 5 star rating! I knew it was a place to check out the hype. So we drove out to the restaurant, easy finding parking and it's right in front of the light rail station.   When we first walked in, it was a small cute dining area with a walk up ordering. The server was SUPER friendly! He took really good care of us since it was our first time and recommended the crispy chicken sandwich and spicy pork. We even got to sample their house made beverages and they were very refreshing! So we ordered the two sandwiches and got them in a timely manner. The first bite was absolutely incredible. I liked how our food was right off the stovetop and into our mouths. The sauces for each sandwich was incredible! Overall, a fantastic experience and did not disappoint!   Definitely worth checking out! Heard they will have a Louisiana fried chicken special coming out soon"}
{"text":"One of, if not the best Reuben I've ever had. I'm routinely disappointed with subpar Reubens, not today. Do yourself a favor and order the house made chips."}
{"text":"This place has to be the absolute worst place I have ever tried to call and place an order. I am trying to plan ahead so that I do not have to wait for poor service if this is the way they take phone orders and I have called five times now and I have not been able to reach anybody. I listen to their message to call back and I'm trying to place an order for pick up and I have done that five times and by now I need to just find a better establishment for lunch for my staff. I don't think the reviews on this site are from patrons."}
{"text":"This cute place was an awesome find while a friend and I were looking for breakfast in Mesa.  Easy to find, and plenty of street parking out front. The restaurant itself is clean and simply decorated, with a cool modern feel. The staff was really friendly and helpful.  We both had the breakfast sammies, a true steal at just $3. They were delicious and unique, and the English muffins they came on were amazing!!! So moist and tasty; and I usually don't like English muffins. I also had a cold brew latte, which was really great. I was really tempted to take home some beautiful fresh flower bouquets that they also sell, but sadly still had a full day of work.  I live far from here, but if I'm ever in the area I would definitely make time to drop back in and support this great local spot!"}
{"text":"This is our new go-to sandwich shop.  They have a great assortment of sandwiches, as well as a special of the day.  The second time we stopped in, I got a swordfish sandwich that was absolutely to die for!  I love that they offer bottled water for free with your sandwich.  The house made chips are crisp with just the right amount of salt.  If you come during the lunch rush, it might be hard to find a table.  Never fear.  Head a few doors down to Oro Brewing and grab a beer and eat your sandwich on their patio."}
{"text":"Amazing! We had the French dip and it was one of the best French dips I can recall in recent memory. The bread was fresh and complimented the meat which was juicy and flavorful. Try the pineapple jalapeño soda..."}
{"text":"After reading all of the other Yelp reviews, I knew I was gonna like this place. Well, like is an understatement. I LOVED this place. Everything about it. The simple decor, to the fact that your sandwich is delivered in a paper wrapper. So simple, but sooo absolutely delicious. I tried the Reuben and the Crispy Chicken sandwich. Both delish, and the chips are yummy too! You can tell that everything is so fresh. I can't wait to go back and try something different!"}
{"text":"Don't burn my grill cheese black and still pack it up to go like it is nice.  Have some pride and remake it if the entire sandwich is charred black wow"}
{"text":"Amazing stop by now before the lines start forming as it is a very small place .  We went here for dinner before attending a function at the Mesa Arts Center.  If I could give it 10 stars I would.  Small menu with attention to detail.  I had the vegetable sandwich it is unlike any vegetable sandwich I have ever had.  Roasted sweet potatoes (I don't like sweet potatoes) pickled cabbage, dried cranberries ricotta spread on sourdough bread.   The burst of flavors. YUM.  Husband had the chicken salad sandwich made to order as a SALAD. Very nice chicken moist with blue cheese crumbles and slightly pickled vegetables.  Customer Service outstanding as well as the cold brewed coffee made in house.  NOTE:  If you going to order their rotisserie chicken, and want to pick up at 4 pm you must call the order in as they start preparation at 4 pm (served freshly cooked) can't wait to try."}
{"text":"They catered a two day course I was taking and I have never had such delicious food at a conference. At the end of the first day, I only wanted to know if they would be back for day two. They catered breakfast, lunch, and snacks and literally everything they offered was delicious (and yes, I tried almost all of it). I have only positive things to say about this great place (and people)!"}
{"text":"Love that they partner with Oro Brewery to provide food. Their buffalo chicken sandwich, bowl style (no bun), was absolutely delicious. Our server was a really personable guy and even gave us some bananas pudding on the house - which was so so good! I will absolutely come back to Mesa to eat here again."}
{"text":"SO. GOOD. My husband and daughter and I were here a couple of weeks ago, right when they were opening and the sandwiches were on point! We shared the Chicken Salad sandwich and the Cuban sandwich. We couldn't decide which we liked better, since the chicken salad was a delicious cold sandwich and the Cuban was a melt in your mouth hot sandwich. They have perfected (already!) the balance of sweet and savory, the bread was outstanding, the sandwiches were very filling, but in a good way. And then the banana pudding. Oh man save room the banana pudding, (or get one, or two to go!). TRUST. It's that good. The owners were there and couldn't have been nicer, and we are so excited to go back and try more of the menu. Can't wait for my daughter to get the grilled cheese with jam on the side, mainly so I can sneak some bites! And the breakfasts and sides look delicious. We will return Worth!"}
{"text":"This is such a great unique place - the food is awesome - we had the Reuben ( yummy ) & we had the chicken salad - everything was delicious & fresh - the banana pudding is amazing - the best we've ever tasted . A very welcoming environment - we will surly be back and hope others come check it out - because it is totally \"worth takeaway \""}
{"text":"Nice lunch spot!! Mapquest didn't get us straight there so we walked around a bit. The Cuban was delicious! The crispy chicken was the fav!  Oro beer was a great accompaniment. Go there! Tasty and generous servings. Pleasant workers!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was fabulous!! The atmosphere was easy going and fun, staff was so friendly and the food was excellent. I had the Rueben and my friend had the Cuban and both of us agreed that they were excellent. Homemade potato chips complimented the sandwich very well and we made room for the homemade banana pudding, which tasted like exactly that, homemade. Loved it!! The staff had excellent service. We ate in the restaurant and as soon as we were wrapping up our chips, they delivered our pudding. I would highly recommend this place for a fabulous sandwich, chips and banana pudding."}
{"text":"What else can I say?  This place is a gem.  The staff is friendly, the prices are fair, and the food is delicious.  I had the chicken salad today and it was probably the best I've ever had.  The banana pudding was also unbelievable.  Thanks to Worth Takeaway, I now have a reason to visit downtown Mesa, and I plan to visit often."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong eating here. I ordered the crispy chicken as a bowl: served on greens and sweet potatoes. The flavors of the sweet spicy sauce went really well on the greens. The chicken was moist and flavorful. Definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"I am in town from Southern, CA and went their with my parents and niece that live in the area locally. We LOVED it!! Best fries we've had in a looong time! We took our leftovers home and everything (even the fries) were AMAZING four hours later. Really enjoyed the patio. Staff is really nice. Can't wait to come back when I am in town again. My parents and niece said they are going back so soon!!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful find! Great coffee and the raspberry waffle was great. They even opened up early for us ! Thank You"}
{"text":"So glad to see places in downtown Mesa. The nitro coffee was amazing. Their prices are high but worth it."}
{"text":"Food was really good. Thought they were missing some important sides like ranch for the chicken strips. Food was very tasty though!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! It was a little hard to find but once I found it it was totally worth it. I got the crispy chicken sandwich which was unbelievable! I added cheese (havarti) of course! I got the house made potato chips which were delicious too. Decor is very cute! Great place all around"}
{"text":"Love this place. Chicken sandwiches are amazing. Service is always good and the banana pudding is just the right amount of sweet and salty."}
{"text":"I have a very short list of amazing sandwiches I've had. The other one being a burger in Blue Ridge, Georgia. I have to add this chicken salad sandwich to my list. I cannot even describe the taste of the chicken salad sandwich. Sound boring? No. This is a chicken salad like no other. There was a tasteful amount of blue cheese and pickled apples which took it to a whole other level. Highly recommend this place. We will be going back again and again."}
{"text":"drove down to Mesa from Scottsdale to see the temple lights and wanted to find somewhere good to eat. We were craving something light and \"homemade\" so we searched on yelp and discovered this gem. It was honestly PERFECT. We ordered the hash (their breakfast is served all day), and it was so colorful with these heirloom carrots and local squash and rotisserie chicken topped with a friend egg. Omg so delicious. Also got the French dip which was better than mama's. Caramelized onions, thin sliced beef, gooey cheese and horseradish it was perfect dipped in the hot au jus. We inhaled it before we could even take a pic! Also got a chicken kids meals for the kids and it was like a fresh homemade version of Kane's chicken. So amazing. And the chips were so good too. Ok seriously nothing was bad! And the prices were super fair for how fresh and local everything was. Staff was super friendly and this is the most important part of my review-- the banana pudding. Do it. Save room for dessert because it's so good and has Oreo crumbs too!! I wish this place wasn't so far but it will be a definite stop anytime I'm down in the east valley!"}
{"text":"Hip and delicious! I had the crispy chicken--cooked perfectly, great flavor! The house-made sodas are excellent too. Friendly staff, quick service. Stop here for lunch--you'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"So my girlfriend works at Groupon and got this spot placed in her name. I myself am a very committed and outgoing foodie, so naturally when she told me about a new restaurant that opened I turned to yelp to glean more information. As most connoisseurs of edibles know a picture is worth a thousand words. Normally a sandwich shop is, well a sandwich shop, not unlike the dozens of others sprinkled throughout town. When I looked at the pictures I could immediately tell that this wasn't just any other sandwich shop. When eating a good sandwich the bread is key, not any old subway variety will do. This was evident when examining the composition of the sandwich as the artisan style bread promptly grabbed my attention. Furthermore, the menu featured a few classic sandwiches indicating a focus on quality over quantity. Upon perusing the visuals, the fact that all of my favorites were there and the reviews also checked out with a perfect five stars, that was it I was sold! My girlfriend and I were both really excited, so excited that we were willing to drive 40 minutes from Northern Phoenix just to give this place a try. Upon arrival at this sleek and minimalist storefront, we were greeted by the owner Kelsey who took our orders. Kelsey was very pleasant, engaging and very down-to-earth. She told us about how her and her husband Jim-Bob had a passion for making good food and seeing people smile, and boy did they! I couldn't help myself, I had to get two sandwiches, the reuben and the croque madam. As soon as I bit into the reuben the freshness and wholesome quality of the ingredients was immediately apparent. The bread had a perfect balance of crust to dough, the sauerkraut was crisp and fresh and the pastrami was savory and flavorful, pure bliss! The croque madam was exquisite as well! A perfect bite to it, with a balance of ingredients and hearty flavors that completely satisfied the palate. If you're looking for an inexpensive sandwich stick to Subway, but if you want a transformative sandwich experience this place is definitely worth the money, time, and drive!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!!! I had the Cuban and my husband had the Reuben. Bother were incredible. We were going to share the banana pudding, but we had to get a second one because half wasn't enough. Makes me wish I lived in Mesa! We will make the trip again just to come here!"}
{"text":"15 mins walk from work. Went there with husband on Friday night. Sandwich really good! Ruben, Cuban, crispy chicken. All very good!"}
{"text":"Possibly the best chicken sandwich I've ever had. The honey Sriracha sauce was amazing with the tangy pickles and fresh ciabatta and the chicken was fried to crispy perfection."}
{"text":"Fantastic service every time I visit. Love the small city like atmosphere. Fantastic food with lots of flavors. Always a great experience overall."}
{"text":"Food was fresh. Taste was good. Service was slower than I expected. My coworker was served and almost finished with his Ruben, before they brought me my Buffalo chicken sandwich. Only about 8 sandwiches on the menu, so don't get why so long to get mine. Banana pudding was homemade, but for $5 portions are too small."}
{"text":"Great food, I had the Ruben and my boyfriend had the chicken salad sandwich. We both had a side salad and we split the banana pudding. We also had two drinks I give it 4 stars only because of the price....$36"}
{"text":"These sandwiches are the \"bomb\"!!!  Love the Cuban.  Hand crafted and home made and local. The banana pudding - can't leave without that.  Calls my name!!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out due to the rave reviews.  It was just ok.  I had the Reuben.  It had good flavor, probably one of the better Reubens I've had but still just ok"}
{"text":"Great food, great price. The menu is limited but everything on it is solid. Definitely worth the trip when the weather is nice so you can sit outside."}
{"text":"Wow!  What a gem in the middle of Downtown Mesa.  Delicious sandwiches and home brewed soda.  We missed on dessert because the sandwiches were so filling (and delicious!).  Definitely trying the place again and again! :)  OH!  They sell fresh cut flowers... so strange for a sandwich shop, but convenient."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite place to eat in Mesa. The best is the crispy chicken sandwich, all the flavors blend so well together and it's amazing! One time my takeout order was messed up and they quickly messaged me back with an apology and sent me a gift card which was so sweet. I am going to push myself to try their other items since they do such a great job but the crispy chicken and the banana pudding are to die for! Great prices too for such a large sandwich."}
{"text":"Strolled in just after they closed but were very nice about it and served us anyway. Great food and amazing people. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is adorable! So many different combinations and everything is so fresh and delicious. The people who work there are so friendly! I had the chicken salad and bread pudding, both incredible! Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Great food and friendly environment. The chips and some sodas are homemade and amazing! In a great location in Mesa so you can look around."}
{"text":"Great little restaurant. In the area for business and looking for something besides fast food before I had to head home. I was able to pull up right outside and was met by very friendly staff. Ordered my food and it was done in about five minutes, which had me back on the road in a short time. The menu was small, but I'm ok with that if the food is good. I tried the Cuban and it was excellent. There were many other sandwiches and other items that is like to try, which means I'll have to swing by when I'm back in town."}
{"text":"My husband and 11 month old daughter found this bfast nook on Yelp, seemed like our kinda place with high quality and locally grown food. Seeing that the bfast menu consisted of three items we decided to get two of the three, my husband got the pastrami sandwich and I got the chicken hash which comes with shredded chicken, sweet potatoes, and brussels sprouts prefect for sharing with my daughter. To drink we got the nitro coffee which was super delicious and creamy. My first drink pick was the cafe latte, being lactose intolerant I needed almond milk which they were out of on a Saturday morning? Super bummed. We got our food the pastrami sandwich was incredible, So many rich and savory flavors! The hash was just ok, the chicken was dry and the sweet potatoes (my daughters favorite) weren't cooked fully :( the portions were great and the price was right also the owner was very nice and knowledgeable with other good restaurants in the area. I'm not giving up on this place, it has a lot of potential and the concept is great. I'm hoping to go back and try the crispy chicken sandwich for lunch, I'm hoping it's WORTH it!"}
{"text":"Came here with a friend for the first time today and overall great experience. It was a bit tough to find at first, but that made it one of those \"hole in the wall\" type places as the owner said haha. I'd compare this place to a diamond in the rough as they say. It's a bit challenging to find right now till they get their sign in but besides that everything was fantastic. The second we walked in we were greeted warmly, got some of the recommendations, and she was more than happy to describe each dish to us. We decided to order the pastrami breakfast and chicken veggie hash. We also had a cup of coffee which is made from a local place. It really has that perfect aroma and acidity to it that you wouldn't really find at a place at Starbucks. The chicken veggie hash I felt was rather great. It's very healthy yet it has extraordinary taste. They seem to get this perfect char on their sweet potatoes that give it a tangy taste and the chicken was perfectly flavored. The pastrami croque madam was also very nice. The bashmel sauce with the pastrami and mustard and egg topping was absolutely delicious! The bread was perfectly toasted and the flavors really complimented each other in the dish. The service was very timely and the owner would come and check in on us every now and then to make sure everything was good and what we thought of the food and if we had any things that we thought they could adjust to better suit their customer base. This is definitely a place I would come back to and I plan to! Reading the reviews I absolutely have to try the Banana pudding but the meal was so perfectly filling I just can't make room haha. The decor isn't lacking either. It's not over the top but just the right touch. The dining space is all made of a wood type table and the one along the wall has a lot of character to it because I just looks so natural (especially the part by the door.) not a single complaint about this place. Thanks for the great experience!"}
{"text":"Was looking for a quick bite and found the cutest small biz! It's nice to know someone still values the sandwich! Light and fresh, had the Chicken Salad and it's worth trying!"}
{"text":"I loved this little joint, with its fabulous spicy fried chicken over salad greens and delicious homemade banana pudding. And my co-workers loved the chocolate-dipped goat milk caramels I brought back for them! Be sure to go antiquing along Main Street afterward; I did!"}
{"text":"God this place is good. The food is amazing. I got chicken salad last time and the soup and it was incredible. I like places that reinvest in the local economy-almost everything here is locally sourced, which feels good too.  I've never had a bad meal here, and no one I know has ever had a bad meal, and this place sets a very high bar. Happy they are in Mesa, and if you're looking for something pretty quick and really outstanding, stop in here and enjoy."}
{"text":"Pretty awesome sandwich: veggie add rotisserie chicken on ciabatta , amazeballz! Soup, chip all fantastic. But sad I didn't get to try the Banana pudding."}
{"text":"I was told this place was delicious so I ordered the crispy chicken sandwich via door dash. Holy cow. This sandwich is so good! I'm so glad I went for it and now I want to try everything else on the menu."}
{"text":"No wonder they have almost a perfect score! Showed up 10 minutes early and they let me in. Great attitudes and the food was amazing! Had a hot coffee for my wife and a cold brew for me...awesome! The food was fresh and nothing was pre-prepared! Suggest this place if you want a solid fresh breakfast and a great cup of java! Will be back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered lunch here yesterday. We split the turkey Calabrian sandwich and shared an order of house made chips. Which was enough to eat. Worth doesn't serve beer or wine but the customer service person suggested we could take our food two doors down to Oreo Brewing Company and eat outside on their patio and enjoy a beer, which is what we did. It was a lovely afternoon, our sandwich was fresh and delicious, the chips were fresh and crispy, not salty. Dave, the owner of Oro, came out to greet us and chat, my husband really enjoyed his blonde lager. Downtown Mesa is slowly changing for the better. Try these two establishments, you'll be happy you did."}
{"text":"Being on a low carb diet, it's sometimes hard to find good food eating out. This place was very accommodating and the food was delicious. I got the Cuban on a bed of lettuce, very tasty. To wash it down I got a cold brew coffee which was also good."}
{"text":"The name of the place says it all. My wife and I decided to stop by on a whim today and we were definitely pleasantly surprised. From the service to the ambiance, Worth Takeaway gets 5 stars in every category. Most importantly, the food.. It's safe to say our expectations were pretty high after hanging out with passionate owners Jim Bob & Kelsey for a few minutes.  They did not disappoint. The Cuban, Reuben and Crispy Chicken Sandwiches were all top notch! They've found a way to source so many amazing local ingredients and incorporate those into every item on the menu. We finished it off with the banana pudding which was so uniquely theirs, yet true to classic quality. Soooo good! The owners have put a piece of themselves into every aspect of this place and it shows. Highly recommend it. This place needs to be on everybody's hot spot list when they're in the Phoenix area.   Great job guys!"}
{"text":"Stopped in while at spring training.  The service was quick, the sandwich amazing. $11 for a single Cuban sandwich without a beverage is a bit steep, but it was Top quality."}
{"text":"Best place for breakfast! A must if you are looking for a new taste in town. A great experience and wonderful customer service.  5 stars is short of the 10 stars they deserve! I recommend especially for a special day or moment and it will make it that more of a memory as it did for me and my mother... Thank you everyone working at Worth Takeaway,  you're all AWESOME!"}
{"text":"Delicious sandwiches and salads, clean and good service! Great place to grab lunch Down town mesa"}
{"text":"Tried the spicy chicken sandwich, veggie sandwich, and grilled cheese.  All excellent.  I didn't try the bread pudding but I heard it was excellent also."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, food is consistently great as well as the service!"}
{"text":"Amazing local place on main street. Tiny little cafe serving mouthful of delicious sandwiches. I ordered the crispy chicken sandwich per yelp advice. It was sweeter than I thought but none the less very juicy and flavorful. My two brothers ordered the Rueben and the Cuban. Being brothers you know I had to swap a piece and both sandwiches were excellent. Friendly staff, free water all good. Bad? Smaller and more intimate than I am accustomed to. Skipped dessert as there was a family that walked in and we were hogging the tables so they couldn't sit together. All in all 5 star food!"}
{"text":"I walked a mile to get here. After eating here, I would have walked 2 miles!  Quaint little place. Very friendly staff. The crispy chicken sandwich was delicious and I loved the homemade potato chips. The vinaigrette on the Simple Greens salad was perfect. The star however was the banana pudding.  I'm not even sure how to describe how good it is. Just eat some."}
{"text":"Finally was able to check out this old bookmark of mine!  The place was empty when I arrived, but the kitchen was busy preparing takeout orders.  WT is a very small space: a small walk-up counter where you lineup to order, which also offers goat milk caramels, fresh flowers, and t-shirts for sale; a refrigerated beverage case; one communal table with about eight chairs; and an L-shaped counter space with perhaps eight or nine high bar chairs.  Be careful sitting at the communal table chairs if you have long hair-- the chair's back ate a few strands of my hair, even when I was trying not to lean on it.  I considered saying something about this to the young lady helping me out, but decided to cut her some slack.    Before I continue, know that the breads here are from PROOF, a local bakery, and almost everything else is made in-house.  Well, \"except for the mustard, mayo, ketchup...\"  There are Italian sodas and spritzers, local Danzeisen dairy's chocolate milk, cocktail tonics, and bottled veggie/fruit juices in the chilled case, along with free bottles of purified water.  (Nice touch!)    Everything on the menu sounded delicious, and I first had a hard time choosing. https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/worth-takeaway-mesa?select=6yZvaA831Ij1HiehZUtWBw  However, between the menu descriptions and my a handful of questions, it seemed like every selection had at least one item I couldn't eat, and most had two, or more allergens I'd have to ask to omit.  Yes, I can deduct this, or that, but a Cuban sandwich isn't a Cuban sandwich without the pickles and mustard, right?  The chicken sandwich options sounded divine, until the cashier pointed out that the dredge/batter contains cornstarch (corn allergy), so I had to skip those.  After a while, I decided on the $9 veggie sandwich: roasted sweet potatoes, dried cranberries, pickled cabbage, and herbed ricotta on sourdough. https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/worth-takeaway-mesa?select=gXwBJjE9urRAtmXa1BLMRA  I also ordered house made sea salted potato chips for $2.  I was still debating on getting the sandwich special, the turkey with Hatch chilis, so I thought I'd see how the veggie sandwich turned out first.  $9 for a sandwich?  This better be good!  Turns out I needn't have worried.  (And I really wasn't, since I'd read so many high praises from so many trusted Yelp friends.)  The roasted sweet potatoes were tender, yet thickly-sliced and hefty enough to withstand bites into the toasted bread and still retain their integrity so that I could discern bites of bread and sweet potatoes as they intermingled in my happy mouth.  The tart pickled cabbage was the perfect foil to the sweetness of the potatoes AND the herbed ricotta, and the dried cranberries added another layer of texture to the bed of ricotta, all of which just added to my enjoyment of the meal.  I wouldn't hesitate to order this again!  Now, those housemade chips on the other hand... https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/worth-takeaway-mesa?select=ib3RlbgQkxjteU803WO65w  For the most part, they were good; I enjoyed the crispiness of most of the chips, and the amount of sea salt was just right, but some of the chips were definitely stale.  Since it was just me dining solo, a few stale chips was no big deal, but if I were sharing these with others, I may not be so flippant about this.  I'll be returning very soon to try two of the \"all-day breakfast items:\" the Pastrami Croque Madame and the Chicken Veggie Hash. https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/worth-takeaway-mesa?select=MYrPlSTHO81y_idyhM1LXg  That is, depending on what the seasonal veggies are that are served with the chicken veggie hash...  Wish I could try the house made banana pudding, but it too also contains cornstarch as a thickener.  I would love to try one of the goat milk caramels from Simple Farm (eight pieces, I think, for $10), but I need to wait until I have a few relatives/friends with me to share with.  WT, why don't you sell these by the piece??  I know, I know... the bag's seal keeps them fresher longer.  I'll try them, eventually.  So happy I stopped by!  p.s.  I ordered the turkey special to \"takeaway,\" but I had to try a couple of bites at the restaurant. https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/worth-takeaway-mesa?select=g7b03A7i09SwrQC15E45qA  Goodness!  Loved the Hatch chilis in this!  They gave the perfect kick to the sandwich; just spicy-enough without being overwhelming.  There were tomatoes, frisee, and maybe provolone (??), with some apple cider vinaigrette.  All delightful!  This was served a bit chilled, though.  Don't know if it's because I'd ordered it to-go, or if it really is served out of the kitchen like that.  No matter-- another winner!  Come in and try this before the turkey runs out!  (She said they have enough to probably last the weekend.)"}
{"text":"This place is pretty great! Convenient location, awesome decor, great food and drinks. They really know how to package in a good experience in 900 sq feet. Anything on the menu is excellent! I prefer the breakfast items myself. I have come to this restaurant many times and the only downfall I've experienced is mix ups with what I've ordered or glitches with their cashier system. Other than that, it has always been a pleasant and warm experience. I hope they open another location!"}
{"text":"This sandwich shop is the best in the valley,  ordered a sandwich next door and somehow the order got messed up and they gave me the sandwich for free.   Since then I've been back multiple times.  Great customer service and some of the best sandwiches I've had!"}
{"text":"Okay, I'm all for small independent businesses, so I'm glad to see this place open in downtown Mesa. It's next door to Mickey's Barbershop which I'm happy about, but sad at the same time because Mickey is retiring. After my chiropractor treatments, I went home and took the light rail to get vegan food at Volstead. Unfortunately, they were closed, but fortunately, Worth was worth checking out! They were open! There were only two items here that I could order, so I went with the grilled cheese sandwich. It wasn't your typical good old fashioned American cheese sandwich, but it was pretty good! The bread had fruit and nuts, and Havarti and white cheddar. Plus it came with a small container of blackberry for dipping! The combination of the grilled cheese and dipping sauce made my mouth happy.  This little eatery is probably not good for big crowds, but they do have enough tables and chairs to accommodate small groups. I'm not a potato chips person, but they do make their batch of homemade chips every morning. They also have seating areas in the front of the store. It's perfect if you are having a small gathering to order small sandwiches.  NEAREST LIGHT RAIL STOP: Country Club & Main"}
{"text":"My husband and I travelled to this restaurant because of all the rave reviews. The ingredients on our sandwiches were very good, but the Reuben had a very small amount of meat. I had the chicken salad which was tasty. We both ordered the chips and they were great! House made root beer had very little taste. We were both anxious to get to the banana pudding. The very small portion was, in our opinion, overpriced. Our bananas were very brown and the date on the containers were two days old. Our meal of 2 sandwiches, 2 chips, 2drinks and 2 puddings came to $43.00. A little high for lunch."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food and the service is excellent. Their crispy chicken sandwich and their chicken salad sandwiches are the best. You cannot go wrong when it comes to food at this location"}
{"text":"Cute and tiny little shop in downtown Mesa that offers breakfast and various sandwiches. I browsed through the menu and ordered the veggie sandwich ($9) with a side salad ($2).  The interior is contemporary with a large table in the center and counter seating along the sides of the restaurant.   The salad was lightly dressed with mixed greens and a cherry tomato cut in half. It was light and refreshing. The sandwich was made in a few minutes and was a huge portion. The sourdough bread was lightly toasted with sweet potato, vinegary red cabbage, and dried cranberries. An herb ricotta spread provided a pleasant creaminess to the sandwich and was a good barrier to prevent the bread from getting soggy. It was good but it's not really a sandwich I would crave and go out of my way to get next time.  Overall a good experience. Since the seating is very limited it is definitely worth it to takeaway!"}
{"text":"Tried Worth Takeaway today for an eat-in lunch.  It was EXCELLENT. We tried the Cuban, the Spicy Chicken Sandwich, with a side of field greens and, of course, the highly touted Banana Pudding.  All were terrific. Clearly they use only the freshest ingredients and put a lot of care into their food. The little place was cute and clean. We were greeted with a friendly smile and received outstanding service.  I'm so excited to return for breakfast to try the Croque Madame."}
{"text":"Crispy Chicken sandwich is unbeatable. Chicken salad is quite different but very delightful. With some chips & banana pudding you can't go wrong. They keep it simple & delicious. I'm getting hungry just typing about it..."}
{"text":"Upon arriving I almost missed this spot as it is very small with only a sign outside of it. I walked past, but saw 2 people eating outside. They do have areas for eating inside and outside. I came in for dinner and at a slow point as they say breakfast and lunch are their busy times. I ordered a home made soda, crispy chicken sandwich, and banana pudding. The people that work here seem very nice and cared about a few crumbs that they had missed where I was sitting and quickly cleaned up. The atmosphere is very indie and the music matches the atmosphere with indietronic beats around me at a good level while I ate. Now to the food. The crispy chicken sandwich was very good. The bread was fresh and the chicken was crispy, but tender on the inside. The pickles tasted very good with the homemade mayonnaise and Sriracha. The banana pudding was really good and I don't usually eat deserts. It was very savory. The soda was bomb as well. I had a good talk with Jim Bob and Kelsey there and on my way out I tried their root beer which was delicious. I'm very pleased with this place. There could be more deliciousness on the menu is my one complaint, but that is not really a complaint with as much good stuff as they have. It is very nice and very small place that everyone should try."}
{"text":"On the expensive side but so \"worth\" it.  Everything in this small New York bodega-esque sandwich shop is fantastic.  Oh man, da banana pudding is crazy good!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious, but the prices are a bit high for what you get. The banana pudding is my favorite. They also have house made kettle chips which are pretty good. I like that you can order their food while at Oro Brewing since Oro has no kitchen."}
{"text":"I had the veggie sandwich and my step daughter had the grilled cheese. My sandwich was so different but blended together it was amazing! My normally picky 14 year old step daughter thought the grilled cheese was also terrific. The best part was the banana pudding / might be my favorite dessert ever now."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a grassroots local business then look no further. Worth Takeaway is legendary example of handcrafted food directly from the source. Owners Jim and Kelsey have a strong grasp on attention to detail and present unique and scrumptious takes on classic sandwiches. Let's just say this sandwich shop should be the new standard and is definitely WORTH a cozy lunch date."}
{"text":"Chicken salad as never seen or experienced. Even without cheese (special orders welcome)"}
{"text":"Love the minimalist decor and baby cacti, service was both friendly (conversational even) and speedy, food/coffee were both delish! I ordered the Chicken Veggie Hash which was large enough to share and the cold brew. I wish I wasn't lactose intolerant or I would've been all over that fresh chocolate milk!"}
{"text":"Nice place. We stopped in for a quick bite and a few drinks to go and were greeted by a very nice and helpful young man.  I appreciated his smile and attentiveness and willingness to tell me more about some of the menu options.  I'll tell you that the kids grilled cheese was fabulous.  I wasn't expecting that at all!  It wasn't a standard grilled cheese in any sense of the word.  I'm getting that next time!"}
{"text":"Worth Takeaway is probably the best sandwich shop I've ever eaten at! I had the Chicken Salad sandwich and my husband had the buffalo chicken sandwich, they were both very tasty!"}
{"text":"My husband and I just ate here after looking at their great Yelp reviews. A limited menu, but we were not disappointed...we had the crispy chicken sandwich and it was excellent. It was so unique, with some great flavors and ingredients. Neither of us typically like pickles in our sandwich, but these sweet pickles that were in the sandwich added a nice crisp and flavor. I especially liked the way all the ingredients were spread throughout, so every bite was scrumptious. We will be going back to try some other things soon."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service and complimentary bottles of water! My only suggestion would be have coffee served after ordering, not with the food."}
{"text":"This really is one of the best places I've ever been to in the Phoenix area. That chicken sandwich is to die for and the service is amazing. I've been here multiple times but today I came with my dog. Two members of the staff at different times came out to offer me a bowl of water for my dog. So friendly and the food once again is to die for. If you have not eaten here it is time that you come, stop what you're doing and come right now. Unless it is a Sunday - make sure to check the hours because I always want this for supper and they close early on Sundays - that is my only critique."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a sandwich, I work in the area, and just love the food. The buffalo chicken bowl is delicious. I'm not a foodie, I was just hungry, and I found myself sitting there and really savoring my lunch. I would go back if the service was terrible just for the food, but that's not case. Friendly staff that is 100% available to you. And wow but the food is fresh and tasty!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness.... So amazing! Banana pudding is to die for, salads and sandwiches are amazing. So evident that the ingredients are quality. I'll be back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"We love Worth! We go almost weekly since they've been open. We're excited to have such a cool little place with quality food and quality ingredients come to our neighborhood and to Main St. You can tell they really care about their customers and the food they serve. I love the way they're have maximized their space inside and make it feel clean and modern.    I hope Worth is a driving force for more quality food and cool environments for Main St in Mesa.   We've had breakfast and lunch and dinner with Worth. Try it all!"}
{"text":"I just recently moved to the area and discovered this gem. Everything here is fresh, fresh, fresh! I typically order the chicken salad sandwich without the blue cheese crumbles and spread. With only olive oil and a small amount of mayo, it's perfect. As one who's not usually a fan of fruit in my main courses, I was blown away by the thin slices of green apple in the chicken salad. It's just enough to take the salad to the next level. Their simple greens salad is just that, simple but refreshing. Their tomato soup is out of this world. They garnish it with a piece of baked mozzarella, to die for! And you can't forget their house made potato chips. They are spectacular! Whether dining in, taking out or ordering via UberEats, this place is a must try!"}
{"text":"Super cool place. Had the egg sammy, which I'd order again and again. They also were happy to make a quick substitution to make another dish vegan. Prices are good. Cold bottled water is free."}
{"text":"Loved the vibe - soundtrack & the delicious crispy chicken sandwich! The home made potato chips were super . There were sweet pickles on the sandwich mmmmm. Just a nice lunch place with quality ingredients. Can't wait to go again to try the root beer they have on tap!"}
{"text":"I had the grilled cheese! It was sooo delicious. It had the best berry jam that went with it and it was the perfect compliment to the sandwich. I can't wait to come back to try the hot chocolate. I've heard it is amazing!  This place is very hipster but the food was so good!"}
{"text":"Glad to have another great restaurant in Downtown Mesa. The Cuban was amazing but, let me tell you about the Banana pudding.. Out of this world!! Glad I made the stop today for lunch."}
{"text":"I'm loving this little hipster breakfast/lunch spot by me. A nice part of Mesa and they carry Danzeisen Dairy and San  Pellegrino!!! Great food and very healthy!"}
{"text":"My husband drove me from North Phoenix just to have a sandwich. First impression was it's a cute, small, and cozy atmosphere. Customer service was excellent. Had the Reuben with home made sauerkraut which was warm and delicious. Tried my husband's Cuban which was a drier sandwich vs the Reuben but just as flavorful. Sneaked a bite of a to go crispy chicken sandwich. It was spicer than expected as honey was a listed ingredient but was very good. It it wasn't for it was my third sandwich to have tried I would have had more. Loved the low cost side of greens with shaved salt. Made the salad more flavorful. The complimentary waters are a great touch of this restaurant though the home made root beer is wonderful."}
{"text":"Small place, clean, friendly, and awesome food. I'm headed back tomorrow to try the Cuban."}
{"text":"Cute little sandwich shop in downtown Mesa.. small location but big flavors.. this place definitely has a following.. a girl from my gym says this is the spot for her cheat meals & we live 20 min away!!   The menu is short but the options available are enough to satisfy every person in your group. The paper menu lists the ingredients in each item.. the wall mounted menu just has the basics   On my first visit I had the Pastrami Croque Madam with the fried egg on top and an orange juice soda .. it arrived beautifully in a to-go container.. it was very filling, good flavor .. delish!   I recently had the crispy chicken sandwich with sweet & spicy pickles on ciabatta.. side of homemade potato chips (kinda salty but oh soo good) i ate the whole bag before I got to my sandwich ..  We will definitely be back.. keep up the great work .."}
{"text":"I've been several times and enjoy the rotating menu. Follow them on Instagram to see what's new!  The sandwiches are delicious, the chips are also tasty. Clean store, friendly staff, and good food!"}
{"text":"Tried the crispy chicken sandwich and banana pudding - both were excellent. The wait time was not too long despite the shop being full. The sandwich comes with siracha mayo and spicy pickles; neither were too spicy for my liking. Likewise, bread pudding was a perfect portion and I loved the consistency. Not too sweet either which I find to be common in some recipes.  Will definitely be returning to try more sandwiches."}
{"text":"Very Clean , fast and friendly service. Rueben was delicious along with the banana pudding. But the banana pudding was a little small for the price of $5.  Will return in the future to support this local Mesa Eatery since I'm a 2nd generation native."}
{"text":"Love love love love this place. Each time I go, I try a different sandwich and each one is amazing. Definitely stop in if you have the chance and try the Buffalo Chicken sandwich or the Chicken Salad Sandwich. The restaurant itself is cute and modern, although if they continue to grow more successful (which they should) they won't have enough empty seats for enough people to try these sandwiches!  The staff is always friendly and willing to change minor details to make your meal more personal and they always make you feel so welcome. Keep doing awesome things Worth Takeaway!"}
{"text":"We took another trip here today and MY OH MY I LOVE THIS PLACE MORE AND MORE! haha   Literally everything is extremely delicious, fresh, and the flavors are bold and mouthwatering. I have never been disappointed with anything here.   I, of course, indulged in a spiced honey iced latte and it was refreshing and tasty as always. The spiced honey is a great flavor and I can't wait till they expand their coffee to start using some of the other flavors offered. The vanilla or chocolate nib would probably be awesome! I should have gotten a bottle to take home.   I just have one complaint - WHY AREN'T THERE MORE! Dear Worth, please come to Chandler!"}
{"text":"Great food. My husband and I got a Reuben and a Cuban and we shared half and we loved it. Our little one had the PB&J and gobbled it up. The House Chips are very yummy too. Sandwiches are $9 and chips are $2 so just go in knowing that. Small inside but there are tables outside as well"}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town & brother recommended this place. He always gets the chicken sandwich and says it is the best he has ever had. I ordered the grilled cheese and was happy with the additional flavor the nut & fruit bread added. My mom ordered the grilled cheese & switched the bread to sourdough with no problem. We were both surprised when we found we have three half sandwiches and not just two. Homemade chips were good so is the tea- it has a fruit flavor"}
{"text":"So Worth is definitely one of those places where you wish you had known of it earlier. And that you lived right around the corner. Delicious! The ciabatta bread is amazing- not heavy and overly filling like most ciabattas. The crispy chicken is fire.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh. From the minute I stepped in was an exceptional experience. Was greeted with a huge grin, was my first visit so took a bit to decide. I decided on the fried chicken sandwich with homemade chips and banana pudding. Was amazing. The bread was amazing, the different flavors in each bite were amazing. Crunchy, savory, sweet... simply amazing . The pudding was best desert I've ever had. Only regret was that I didn't think to get a second order to take home for tomorrow... would recommend it highly for an treat to your tastebuds!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent Reubens and Cubans. The staff very friendly.  Small place, but nice atmosphere.  Few breakfast items, but nice choice in sandwiches."}
{"text":"Wow - awesome food, great value, and an interesting twist.  Very, very pleased with this place!"}
{"text":"Seriously so good! The crispy chicken sandwich and the pastrami croque are amazing! Staff was so friendly too! Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Duuude!  So good. All things considered... near perfect.   Food that's fresh, a simple well chosen menu and great tasting food. I'm not one to throw around 5 stars but these guys deserve every one. So many 5 star reviews for this place...sweet.  So we ordered some special pork slider sandwich things...delicious.  A Ruben, a Cuban  and some sweet potato salad deal with a fried egg on top...all bomb. Oh Ohh Oh! the lime soda is the deal. A simple interior with 15 or so seats and a few tables outside. Hence the name.  Last words...please don't change."}
{"text":"Just tried them for the first time. The guy was super helpful with the mixer advice. Ordered two sandwiches and a couple mixers. $55. When we got home we only had one sandwich. Called up ask the guy about it and he was short and rude about it. The one sandwich we got was good but the service was piss poor. Probably won't be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"The food is AMAZING! I stopped here with coworkers and we were all blown away with how good the food is and the great atmosphere in Oro. I highly recommend this place and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Love this place. We always get their buffalo chicken sandwich and a grilled cheese because their dipping sauce is phenomenal. Order the banana cream pudding if it's available. There's a reason it sells out every day!"}
{"text":"Yummy place that we ran across on a Saturday morning. Not too busy for prime brunch time. The cold brew is delish and worth the price and the service is thoughtful and quick. The Buffalo chicken dip and croque madam were really yummy but my boyfriend didn't love the burrito. We would definitely go back though."}
{"text":"Everytime I eat here, its truly phenomenal. I've had everything on the menu now aside from one or two items. I could eat here every day. My faves are the Cuban and the crispy chicken. I always order chips, extra bleu cheese sauce and a cold brew.  I would recommend to anyone"}
{"text":"Oh my god you guys! This place is such a gem. First we got excellent customer service from the front line staff. The guy working the register helped us with our order selection and did not lead us wrong. My boyfriend ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich and I ordered the crispy chicken sandwich and we traded. Both were amazing! The breaded chicken is the star of the show and then the flavors of the sauces of each sandwich complements the chicken perfectly. The bread is super tasty! Will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Check it out! Delicious sandwhiches, nice atmosphere. Just happened by...Ginter on purpose!"}
{"text":"This place is insane.  They catered a meeting for us and let me tell you - the food was incredible.  The chef, Matt, creates everything with love and you can absolutley see that.  Everything... and I mean everything just got better and better with each meal.  We had breakfast, lunch and 2 snacks for 2 days and everything was just perfect.  These guys do it right.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We found this place on yelp and decided to give it a try. We are visiting from California. I never write reviews but I just had to for this place because it was that good!!! I had the chicken salad sandwich which was so delicious!!! It had apples and blue cheese and olives and so much flavor. I also had the homemade chips which were so yummy! The cold brew coffee was so good too! And the owner was seriously so nice and welcoming. If you are in Mesa ,AZ you definately need to go to Worth Takeaway!"}
{"text":"Neither my wife or myself remember how we heard about this place but I'm so happy we tried it! I had the crispy chicken sandwich with a side of greens. It was outrageously good! The sandwich had a good sized piece of perfectly fried chicken breast on some excellent chabota(?SP?) Bread with house made sweet\spicy pickles and a delicious shiracha sauce. The small side salad had a nice mix of premium greens and a very good vinaigrette. The only minor down side would be the small seating area, normally this time of year we would have just sat outside but unfortunately it was raining today. Again a very minor gripe.  I love to find another small locally owned eatery to add to our rotation, with places like this I don't understand why people would want to go to chain restaurants.."}
{"text":"This place is truly amazing! The food is far away from the generic and has something to please everyone. Even kids! The staff is really friendly and the food comes out quickly. The bathroom is located through the kitchen, and my daughter had to go so they very kindly let us use it. Walking through the kitchen I noticed that it was extremely clean and everyone preparing the food was properly handling it all with gloves. Truly an impressive place."}
{"text":"Good food in a clean restaurant... what more can you ask for? Oh right, very friendly staff! I would recommend to anyone looking for a new favorite place to eat!"}
{"text":"Great service awesome breakfast! Friendly staff! Chicken veggie hash & breakfast burrito were fantastic!!! Would definitely go there again!"}
{"text":"I don't make it over to Mesa too much, but was in the area and thought I would check out the local eats.  This spot stood out with the 5 star review and over 175 reviewers which is fairly tough to achieve.  Walked into Worth around 10am on a Sunday.  The first thing that stood out was how small this place is - room for about 6-8 at a long table and stools facing towards the window and wall with seating for about 10.  I was considering doing some work in the laptop, but it would have been a little cramped.  They had coffee but it had to be brewed on the spot - coffee tasted good and hit the spot for some morning caffeine.  Was pleased to see they serve their sandwiches all day - went with the crispy chicken one based on photos and reviews from yelpers.  Sandwich was very good - the sirachua, mayo, honey combo was great and the chicken and bread was on point.  Wished the chicken was a tad crisper as the breading was falling off in some areas.  The lettuce was probably good too, but the heat of the chicken made it a limp mess - I pealed it off.  Service was quick and efficient.  Although some of the aspects of this spot were not what I expected, they still do a very good job with what they probably are trying to accomplish.  If I want to do some work while having an americano coffee, I'll go elsewhere.  However, if I need a tasty chicken sandwich at a reasonable price for takeout, this is probably one of he first spots I will come to.  Can't wait to try with an IPA!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and have loved it both times. There's few words to describe how enjoyable their food is. The only complaint possible is that the seatinf situation is rather unpleasant. You're basically sitting on top of each other and constantly bumping into each other whenever you move. But it's part of the experience too!"}
{"text":"I love this place. So cute. Clean. Friendly. It's awesome. I love their home made soda. Always different but always great!!!"}
{"text":"What a refreshing place to go to! The first time I went here was on a Sunday and they were one of the few places open in downtown Mesa. The second time I went I didn't realize it was the same place until I got there. I love that you can convert any sandwich to an salad which is what I've done both times. I can't get enough of their roast beef salad. The dressing is light and not drowning the salad. The vegetables are slightly pickled but not too tart. Sweet potatoes are a nice addition. And I love that they give you a FREE bottle of water while you wait. Everywhere else you go nowadays, the bottled water is more expensive than the rest of the drinks."}
{"text":"Excellent sandwiches! Plus a very nice outdoor seating area to enjoy the food. Highly recommend for a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"This is the type of food that there should be more of. Everything and made and perfectly balanced to make an amazing sandwich. I was reminded of the small places that are common in places like Portland, OR where the vibe is very nice and I feel like they want me to be wowed by what I am eating, and I was. I tried the reuben, crispy chicken sandwich, and the chips. They were all amazing and so different with each bite they got better. I will definitly need to come back to try more menu items."}
{"text":"Outstanding.  Adorable place. Super friendly staff and just about the BEST veggie sandwich I've ever had. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and go here. People who work here are super friendly. Sandwiches are delicious. And I don't usually eat banana pudding, but this place makes me want to."}
{"text":"We were so impressed by the quality of food and the warmth of the owner's hospitality. We tried the Cuban sandwich, crispy chicken sandwich, and banana pudding. Everything was delicious. I especially liked the flavor of the pickles on the sandwiches and the texture of the bread. This place is an absolute gem."}
{"text":"Such a great downtown eatery. Cool, hip and food is great! Had salads both times, once w veggies and the other time w the Cuban pork. Both excellent. What's cool is that you can take any sandwich and make it into a salad.  The banana pudding is a homemade and while I didn't get it on my last visit, I'm dying to try it. My co-worker devoured his too quickly. House made chips are great and my fellow yelper's have been raving about the breakfast menu too. So I'll have to try that next time.  Overall, great, friendly service, excellent food in a cool part of downtown Mesa. Follow them on FB they're always posting updates!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! Angie, is the best part about this place! She is beyond accommodating and understanding and is constantly giving the most amazing customer service! I could write a review about her every time I come in!"}
{"text":"Soooooo delicious, had the grilled cheese and crispy chicken. Wonderful. Really nice atmosphere and friendly service. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"We LOVE Worth Takeaway! We order it through UberEats, sometimes we come into the shop, and we ALWAYS order food when we're next door at Oro. Our favorite sandwiches are the Buffalo Chicken, the Chicken Salad, and the Veggie (which is crazy because neither of us are vegetarians!). For brunch, the Pastrami Croque Madame and the Chicken Veggie Hash are amazing. I usually order the seasonal soup as well and have always loved it. Thanks for keeping us full, Worth!"}
{"text":"Visited Worth Takeaway with a friend the other day! I came early so parking wasn't too bad and it wasn't too hard to find. I don't spend too much time in (downtown) Mesa but going to this cafe captured a small community of Mesa that I thought was cool. Quite a few hipsters and young families that you would elsewhere find on Pinterest, but there was also an older couple so a good variety was going on. I got the Chicken Veggie Hash which was scrumptious and made me feel healthy which is always a plus. I also ordered the Cold Brew Latte and all I can say is: WOW! I've never tasted anything like it. The first sip was a journey of flavors, kind of felt like a carwash: you got to experience every part of the drink and at the end felt refreshed. If you like cold brew (or nice people/atmospheres), get in your car and head over to Worth Takeaway!"}
{"text":"Delicious and tasty sandwiches. Cute decor. Great service. Perfect lunch spot in downtown Mesa!"}
{"text":"The crispy chicken sandwich was so good I'm considering going back for the second time in 24hours. I was extremely impressed with the quality of the sandwich and service here. The homemade chips are the perfect addition to really fill you up. I would 10/10 suggest giving this place a try if you've never been! My girlfriend got the Ruben and it was amazing too, I don't think you can go wrong with anything here."}
{"text":"It's just an OK sandwich place. I'm wondering where are all those 5 star ratings coming from? Maybe I ordered something wrong. I ordered a crispy chicken sandwich for $10.53. Nothing really impressed me. And they don't have a restroom for customers to use."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to try this place out and we are so happy we did!! We both got the crispy chicken sandwich and loved it! Best sandwich I've had in a long time!! We will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Crazy tasty stuff.  These folks have really put some thought into flavor and what kinds of flavors compliment each other, and their sandwiches show it.  I've had the Reuben, and it's about as good as it gets.  House made kraut?  Whoa.  And last night I had the crispy chicken sandwich and my son had the Cuban.  Both were delicious.  Add in their house made potato chips, each one perfectly shaped and as thin as can be.  And their banana pudding?  Holy smokes.  It's enough to make a guy want to move to Mesa.  And don't be a meatball.  Try their house made soda.  Last night, I had rosemary lemon soda and it was so tasty.  If quality is important to you, and you like your food made with love and passion, you won't be sorry.  If you don't care about those things, well...there are literally thousands options for you."}
{"text":"Very good breakfast food. Been here multiple times and I've never been disappointed. Menu is not very extensive but remains consistently good. Love the fresh milk they offer as a beverage. The service is top notch. Just overall a great place!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely phenomenal!  We had their breakfast take out this morning and couldn't been more happy!"}
{"text":"Went and got sammy's with my boyfriend before work. It was a little hard to find (mostly because we kept walking by without noticing it). It's a little place but the people working were super nice. He got a cuban and I got the buffalo chicken. SO GOOD. Bread is artisan, crunchy and soft. Flavor was out of this world. And it's a large amount. We took half of both home and ate later. Have to go back!!!"}
{"text":"I didn't know what to think, but this place had been on my \"to do \" list for quite some time due to its longevity and amazing collection of 5-star Yelp reviews. We were in the area at lunch time, so we decided to finally give it a shot. The place is tiny inside, but there is room to sit outside.  The short review: I really enjoyed this place.   Sure, you get sandwiches and drinks, but they're REALLY great sandwiches and drinks -- including house-made sodas. I had a watermelon and basil soda, which I guess makes a periodic appearance on the menu. When I ordered it, the cashier immediately offered to let me try it before I committed, which I thought was nice. Maybe not so many people are as food-adventurous as they think they are, and the people at Worth seem to care about you having a good experience.   To go with my tasty soda, the menu had a daily grilled chicken special that sounded excellent, but I ultimately went with with the Calabrian Turkey sandwich (turkey with coppa, fontina, chili aioli, dressed greens and tomato). The lettuce was nice and crisp, the tomato juicy, and the coppa provided a nice balance to the richness of the turkey. Everyone else in my family had the French Dip, hold anything \"interesting\" (= \"scary\") so I don't have much to say except that I though the meat was juicy and had good flavor. The hoagie rolls were as fresh as the fillings and the au jus was served hot. In that \"naked\" configuration, however, they disappeared quickly.   I also tried the orange soda, of which my wife was not really a fan. She didn't like the \"creamsicle\" taste. If you're considering the sodas, ask for a little sample and I'll bet they will let you try before you buy.   Sadly, I was so full that I couldn't fit the banana pudding, so I'm going to have to go back (twist my arm, right?)"}
{"text":"Holy Moly!!!!!! If I could give 6 stars I would!! The food is amazing. Best Ruben I have ever had!!!!! Locally baked bread...what up Proof!!! The meat was delicious and the sauerkraut is made on site and it's so delicious. And that it was served on ciabatta life changing!!"}
{"text":"I'm kinda surprised this place has so many 5 star reviews. I ordered a Cuban and it would have been great if I would have had been drunk on my way home from the bar. The Cuban in my opinion was lacking some flavor. My Dr Pepper in the 12 once can was the best thing going. Chips were good but that's hard to mess up. All in all I won't be returning but had to give it a try"}
{"text":"Go for the rotisserie chicken; it's worth the trip. Order it ahead. But, not to worry, the rest of the food here is also good, the customer service is outstanding, I mean super accommodating . They use fresh ingredients and support local vendors. As a special treat for me, they also serve outstanding coffee and handed me a glass bottle of half and half. Eat in or take home, this place is a delight."}
{"text":"We are from out of town and Worth was recommended by family. This place has it figured out! They don't try to do it all but rather do a few things very well!! Great tasting and clean eating. Best of all, great price."}
{"text":"Amazing and worth every penny. The prices were a little high but the flavors justify. If you're in the mesa area this is a must stop. I definitely recommend the crispy chicken, grilled cheese, and banana pudding."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend for lunch today and I'm sooooo glad she recommended this spot.  I'll start with the soda... they had two sodas a jalapeño pineapple and a delicious lime concoction - they let me try both and honestly were both so delicious it was hard to choose. I want to go back and get the jalapeño pineapple to go so I can bring it home and make a cocktail with it... it was amazing.   The homemade Chips were nice and crispy, and went great with my sandwich. I smothered those perfectly crispy chips in their mouthwatering blue cheese dressing and hot sauce #yup.   The sandwich... oh the sandwich... It was so perfect that I'm almost mad. The chicken was crispy and juicy, the hot sauce and their homemade blue cheese were a flavorful combo without overpowering the sandwich. The bread was soft enough to bite into but crispy enough on the outside to hold all those wonderful ingredients together so perfectly. The best buffalo chicken sandwich (possibly the best sandwich) i have ever had.   Can't wait to go back and make my way through the rest of the menu. Well done Worth!"}
{"text":"Super cute cafe with the BEST fried chicken sandwich that I have ever had.  Great little patio out front where we shared our sandwiches (the other one was roast beef)  The service was very good and will definitely come back whenever we are around the downtown Mesa area."}
{"text":"Wonderful grown up grilled cheese with blackberry jam, and veggie chicken hash loaded with sweet potatoes and topped with a fried egg. Complimentary bottled water, and staff checking to make sure you're having a great time. Loved it!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are pretty much regulars here because this place is so good! The grilled cheese is my goto order but its also always fun to try their specials which change every few days! Very deserving of 5 stars"}
{"text":"I went to this place one time and I want to go back I'm just never in Mesa but this place is worth the drive no pun intended it's legit one of the best sandwich spots in the valley fasho."}
{"text":"Worth does a great job of overcoming its challenges. The place is tiny and not very accommodating for more than just a few customers.  The location is just plain awful, they are the sole reason to venture to the ghost town that is downtown mesa.   With that said, they do a great job of executing the few items that are on their limited menu. The cold brew coffee is quality, and the chicken salad on sourdough was simple, delicious, and had just the right amount of creativity.   The star of the meal was the crispy chicken with the honey sriracha sauce. Juicy and crispy, flavorful chicken with sweet & spicy flavors. It is so good. Honestly, I just might prefer to have it without the bland & heavy ciabatta bun.   Offered as a side, the potato chips are tasty. Get them.  As a fan of bananas, I was really looking forward to the banana pudding, but I was underwhelmed. The pudding is alright, it just seems like its dominated by Nilla wafers & whipped cream. It needs more creamy pudding and most importantly BANANA.   Overall, I really enjoy Worth Takeaway and I am looking forward to coming back and trying other items. Maybe next time they'll have something that resembles a plate. Eating off of a piece of paper is kinda lame, especially when you can easily drop $30 for two people."}
{"text":"Came all the way from San Diego to eat at Worth Takeway!  I had the chicken salad sandwich and my friend had the rueben.  We literally licked our fingers clean - it was amazing.  Then I had their banana pudding and I was in heaven.  Please open a shop in California!"}
{"text":"Super cute with delicious and fresh fresh fresh homemade brunch/lunch options. Great portions. Save room for the banana pudding. Seriously."}
{"text":"Wow!  Loved the sandwiches.  My mom got a French dip and it was delicious!  I had the crispy chicken and it was excellent!  Great customer service!  Cute, small place, but there are tables outside (bummer for summer).  I highly recommend!  I live in Gilbert, and it was worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Fresh baked bread. Small menu. I wanted some spice, most things were just spicy sauces, no jalapeños :/   Got the fried chicken with spicy chili sauce, was very good, but needed more heat. On a scale 1-5, id say it was about 2. Kind of like a fancy chicken sandwich from that fast food chicken place.   Also got the spicy pork, the right about of spice in the sauce, but the pork lacked flavor.   I'd recommend."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town, I came across this small restaurant and couldn't resist but check it out due to its great reviews. Oh my goodness their sandwich tasted amazing. I ordered their crispy chicken sandwich with an iced cold brew, and everything was delicious! The crispy chicken is a big portion, could've easily fed two. The flavor was so fulfilling, and the pickles and spread worked perfectly with the very very tasty chicken strips. As a matter of fact, I loved the sandwich so much I came back here on the second day of staying in town, just to order the same thing. This time, I split the sandwich between two people and it was equally satisfying. Only if I can bring this restaurant back with me.. If I do come back to visit Mesa I will definitely stop by! A definite must to check out, loved it here!"}
{"text":"Watch out for these two! Jim Bob and Kelsey are shaking up downtown Mesa with real \"foodie\" fare. The cuban, the italian sodas, the breakfasts, and last, but not least,....that banana pudding is addicting. Next on my list is that chicken sandwich that everyone is writing about. Cute, hip, little place whose only downside is the struggling air conditioner that the landlord should fix."}
{"text":"Such a cute neighborhood spot! The vibe and decor is great and the food does not disappoint! I had the croque Madame and simple greens and everything was great. The dressing on the greens was so fresh and flavorful. Then we had the banana pudding... You could see the fresh vanilla beans throughout and there is an amazing salty sweet flavor that was so unique yet maintains the \"down home\" flavor you know and love. The service was super friendly and efficient. Highly recommend this awesome little gem."}
{"text":"Dear Worth, your gourmet sandwiches are pure heaven! Thank you for the unbelievably delicious Calabrian Turkey today. I am singing your praises - for both your food and incredible customer service! :)"}
{"text":"Incredible!!! We are visiting and we're hoping to find something fresh and clean, it far surpassed any expectations!! I had the roasted chicken bowl. It had the best combo of blue cheese, roasted sweet potatoes, and a tarragon dressing. The best  My husband and son shared a Rueben sandwich. Absolutely the best we have ever had!!  Thanks worth!!"}
{"text":"First time here today. Called in to order ahead. Found parking right in front, my food was ready and and at the front. Service was great, she was really nice and informed me that I was getting a free banana bread pudding today because it was there one year anniversary. Food was delicious, I got the roast beef sandwich with the house made chips on the side. Everything was great, I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Good food, had the BBQ Chicken sandwich but only complaint about it was it tasted a little salty.."}
{"text":"I don't review much bit I'm trying to get better, especially when I have something good to say.  I just moved to the area a few days ago and was so hungry after a job appt.  Saw WORTH TAKEAWAY on Yelp and decided to try it.  Totally worth it, had the crispy chicken sandwich (I don't usually do deep fried) and it was delicious.  The crispy added to the overall te,ture and flavor, spicy pickles and sauce was on point adding that extra little kick. THEY use a local bakery for their bread and off a non bread option too. Free bottled water and they threw in chips for me to try also, I think they're homemade?  In addition the service really stood out. Kelsey who heard I had just moved also was so nice to write down a list of other eateries and restaurants that would be good to try.  And then I saw her and the other employees be equally as personable and helpful to the other patrons.  Great service, friendly and welcoming, fresh and great food.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I cannot get enough of this place! My go-to is the chicken salad sandwich & a honey latte. The staff are so friendly & the environment is awesome."}
{"text":"A must try!! I had the chicken veggie hash and the hubby had a breakfast burrito. My chicken veggie hash was yummy if you like sweet potatoes, Brussel sprouts, rotisserie chicken with a over easy egg. Definitely a nice place for a local Mesa restaurant that makes everything fresh and not canned!! We are coming back!"}
{"text":"I usually never venture into Downtown Mesa, but I met met my wife for lunch at Worth Takeaway and I was not disappointed.   The staff was exceptionally helpful and genuinely curious about how we liked everything.   I had the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich and it was perfect. I've had this sandwich literally all over the country and this little gem nestled in the heart of Mesa topped every other Buffalo Chicken Sandwich I've ever had. Perfect amounts of everything.   Two thumbs up Worth Takeaway!!!"}
{"text":"Mmmmm these sandwiches were legit tasty! I tried a special they were running that was a grilled cheese with pot roast ish meat inside and their chicken sandwich (and some chips). The grilled cheese was good, but the chicken sandwich was awesome!!! The chicken is perfectly fried (so much so that when it didn't come out right the chef came out and told us they were remaking it... Without serving it first... And gave us some free chips (which were amazing)... Now that's integrity). Their hot sauce is super tasty and their pickles are also pretty fab. The portions are large and the prices are reasonable. They make most of their food in house. The only reason they aren't 5 stars is because I need to go back (you know, for consistency's sake) and the banana pudding (which was OK, but not amazing) . Definitely go check out their chicken sandwich and you can thank me later."}
{"text":"Went here to pick up breakfast for a few employees, and the only word to describe the food is WOW !!  Or AMAZING !!  We had the pastrami croque and it was off the charts good.  This is a hole in the wall, hard to find, so get your glasses on and go try the food. It is well worth it"}
{"text":"Picked out this eatery after reading reviews, WOW turned out great!! I was looking for kind of a brunch entree, ordered the Pastrami Croque Madame, it was sooo good. It was prepared perfectly with ingredients that I love, check out description on site. We ate outside in enclosed eating area abt 11:30am. The coffee was great, the service workers were friendly, the food came promptly. I would definitely come back here! It was a perfect experience."}
{"text":"Wow-ee-wow! This place is out of this world.  The sandwich menu is varied and interesting.  I had what I consider the best buffalo chicken sandwich on the planet...and I've eaten quite a few in my day.  The coating on the chicken will blow your mind.  This place has ruined me for buffalo chicken and maybe even sandwiches.  I had a cold brew that was sublime to boot.  I really wish we didn't live 1700 miles away from this place."}
{"text":"Have had my sights on this place for awhile and finally had the opportunity to go for the first time earlier today. Must say, wish I would have gone sooner. My girlfriend and I split the crispy chicken sandwich & the Italian grinder. Which was a mistake. Based on the reviews I read, I knew the crispy chicken sandwich was going to be good but I didn't expect it to be holy s**t good. The grinder held its own, a good Italian sandwich, but it's no match for the crispy chicken. Needless to say the reviews didn't lie...it's incredible. All the way from the ciabiatta bread (amazing), sriracha sauce, house made pickles (don't normally care for pickles but wanted to give them a shot), to the juicy, tender chicken....it's phenomenal. I recommend making plans to get yourself one soon. Don't make the same mistake I did, however, keep the other half from your significant other"}
{"text":"Oh my sweet baby Jesus. The pastrami croquet!!! Oh man ooooooooooo so good. I'm not really sure what else to say but that was ridiculously satisfying. First time here, won't be the last:)"}
{"text":"Great people and service! I had the crispy chicken sandwich and it was amazing!!! Gotta come back to try more things on the menu!"}
{"text":"The sandwiches were tasty, but nothing for me to write home about... Just Yelp about ;)   I'm glad I tried it (everyone's been raving about it) but now that I've had it.. I don't know if it would be on my list of \"must go back\" restaurants. However, I am extremely particular when it comes to sandwiches.. So.. In all honesty, it was tasty and it's WORTH a try.  The best part was probably the banana pudding.. Which I've tried at magnolias bakery.. Already setting my expectations pretty high.. But it didn't do too bad in the running.. Which is very impressive!  The ingredients were all fresh, HUGE PORTIONS, and the staff was very friendly. I'd recommend it to sandwich lovers.. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I enjoy sandwiches but do not feel like you get your moneys worth here which is a little ironic considering the name"}
{"text":"Ordered via Uber Eats. The food was prepared quickly and was delicious! I ordered the breakfast burrito. As a big eater, I was surprised by how big the burrito was. The green sauce it comes with is great. I'll definitely be ordered from here again in the future."}
{"text":"I'll keep it brief: Worth is delicious and delightful! Honestly, Worth made one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. On a warm day, you can't beat a sandwich, beer, and a seat on their patio.  A must try!"}
{"text":"I went for breakfast without knowing anything about this cafe. Does not look like much from the outside but the food was excellent. Not for the ham and egg set but if you want a delicious meal that is out of the ordinary definitely try Worth Takeaway."}
{"text":"Hands down - best sandwich shop in the entire Phoenix and surrounding area.   Tiny tiny place that doesn't try to impress by trying to do too many things at once.   The Crispy Chicken may be the best lunch item I've ever eaten.   Pair these sandwiches with a beer from Oro Brewery, a couple doors down, and you've found the nook and cranny where the locals go to eat and drink."}
{"text":"Completely adorable and aesthetic little sandwich shop! Fresh ingredients, flavors that excite your tastebuds, super fair prices and overall an experience that leaves you craving the next visit before you even leave!"}
{"text":"The wife and I ordered take out from Worth Takeaway tonight.   I had the Reuben. I added pickles, they were made by WT. The pickles and sauerkraut had a good crunch. The bread was fresh baked from local bakery PROOF; crunchy crust ciabatta went great with the smooth dijonnaise.   Wife had the chicken salad on sweet potatoes instead of the bun. They are awesome with switching out the bun.   I hate bananas. But they had a special where you get their famous banana pudding with a entree purchase. I ate it, I loved it, I am in an existential crisis. But I loved it."}
{"text":"Tried this place for lunch while in downtown Mesa for a work meeting. Very welcoming and friendly staff, good food, and accommodating. Definitely recommend the chicken salad sandwich- delicious!"}
{"text":"This sandwich shop is legit! The crispy chicken sandwich is the bomb! It's super delicious, the skin on the chicken gives the sandwich a great flavor and it's amazing! Had the Cuban sandwich as well, the mustard is on point! I am not a big fan of pickles, but their pickles are quite delicious."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic!  Met the owner and she was super nice!  Very accommodating!  Food was absolutely delish!  Loved it! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We are here on vacation & wish we had a \"worth takeaway\" back home! The food is so fresh. Let's start off with the delicious chocolate milk, yummy! My boys are chocolate connoisseurs & boy oh boy did they say this local delight is the best ever! Loved that bottled water is free! Who knew, that places still offered FREE anything?!  Let's get to the food...we had the Crispy Chicken Sandwich that was very tasty & dressed perfectly. The crunch was just enough to make this sandwich complete. We also gave the Buffalo Chicken a go & woohoo, it was surely delish! The sauce was tangy, had a kick but truly a great add! Lastly, had the roast beef sandwich....yum, yum, yum! The sandwich was so fresh, tasty & hats off to the chef for knowing what condiments & cheese needed to take this sandwich to the next level! ?? We really did enjoy this little find! Thank goodness for the helpers that take the time to help us out of towners out by pointing the way to little hidden gems like this place!l"}
{"text":"June 2016 update: Okay, I feel weird leaving ANOTHER review, but every time I eat here I love it MORE! The banana pudding is one the best desserts I've ever had. My husband is so obsessed with it that he is constantly recommending it to people and trying to make his own version at home (unsuccessfully). Haha. The crispy chicken sandwich and the Reuben are so good! We love this place!   Original update: It's only a week later, but I really wanted to give this place another try. I went for breakfast and wanted to try a sandwich over greens and sweet potatoes. They were nice enough to make a Reuben for me, even though it wasn't lunch yet. The sauerkraut was dynamite! I really enjoyed the dish and the owner was very friendly and sweet.   It's great to have such a neat eatery in downtown Mesa. I hope they are successful and are around for many years to come! I think I'll ride my bike next time. :)"}
{"text":"Read about this in the paper . . . had to give it a try.  It was so delightful to enter this quaint, clean establishment.  I had the chicken salad sandwich . . . it was not your typical mayo type chicken salad . . . the flavors just melted in your mouth and the bread is worth the carbs!   Instead of charging $2.00 for a 12 ounce bottle of water . . . it is complimentary . . . with that said . . . YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS 21ST CENTURY AWESOME PLACE!  I intend to go back to eventually try everything on the menu."}
{"text":"First of all, SO CUTE. I love seeing downtown mesa revamping! The service was awesome and we chatted throughout our time there about the cool food they have and the local ingredients they use. Also...they use Proof Bread. Enough said!"}
{"text":"Stopped by this place on our vacation, it's super cute and trendy. The food was amazing! I had the buffalo chicken sandwich, banana pudding and a nitro coffee. So good. The staff was super personable and answered all of our questions. My boyfriend enjoyed the music selection. Definitely would come back here again if we're in town!"}
{"text":"Just tried Worths Takeaway for the first time - love it! Great homemade chips..I got those, the pastrami sandwich and their homemade Rosemary lemon soda. So tasty! Will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Not sure I can add much to what was already stated. Very small inside but I was welcomed warmly. The menu is limited. The service was great and my sandwich was delicious. ( turkey) I liked their syrups and local juices too. I knew I would like the place when I walked in and the staff had on State48 shirts. Ha!"}
