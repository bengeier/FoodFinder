{"text":"Staff was great. Atmosphere was 50s diner. Food was worth it. Will definitily come back."}
{"text":"All the food looks great some thing for every one. Kids area with cartoons. Open 7am to 3pm so if your heading to Cosco great food stop on the way. 50's style decor with a modern touch some booths with power and USB port free wifi."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. This was my second visit and was not at all disappointed on either visit. The food is super tasty, lots of gluten free items if you need it. I had the bacon waffles and they were amazing. The decor is very well done and they use a lot of technology to make everything efficient including getting on the waiting list before you even leave your home."}
{"text":"Worst attempt at chicken and waffles I have ever seen in my life! Two tinny deep fried chicken fingers, which tasted like Costco brand and one soggy old waffle with no fixings and didn't even include butter. My husband got the vanilla cinnamon French toast with berries and whip cream. Two pieces he was served which seemed like a week old and just heated in the oven for 5 minutes. French toast was not even edible because it was so hard and dry came with one side serving of what appeared to be frozen berries  out of a bag and one side serving of cheap pre made whip cream and I am not sure what the vanilla cinnamon description meant since it was plain French toast. If you can avoid this place at all costs please do so! Expensive for what you get, wouldn't even pay $5 for this again!"}
{"text":"I got to grab breakfast here on the way back to Edmonton, and I can say that I left full and moderately  satisfied. Its an adorable restaurant with an old vintage theme. I really appreciated the decorations of the restaurant, it was super enjoyable to look at. I honestly gave an extra star because of the fact that I got to sit in the Elvis section and couldn't have been happier. As far as the food goes it was swaying around average. They have a decently big menu and there's a fair bit to choose from, especially the eggs ebnnedict. I ordered the chicken and waffles eggs benny with a peach tea. The fruit on the side was really fresh and the tea was delicious! I also really enjoyed the waffles, they were very cinnamon-y and real talk.. they were the best waffles I've had! Soft and flavorful - they were great! As far as the chicken, I would bet my bottom dollar it was from frozen. I won't complain too much because the rest of the dish was fine, but the chicken was truly lacking unfortunately. It certainly wasn't what I was expecting at all - they were dry, store-bought style chicken fingers. The potatoes though we're well seasoned and soft, a little overdone but I like them that way. 
The service was great, our waitress was very perky and attentative. It was a little pricier than I would have expected for the quality of the food but nothing too crazy. Next time I'm in Calgary I will most likely be trying out a new breakfast place but I wouldn't completely discourage you from trying it out. If you're a huge Elvis fan like I am, it might just be worth it to sit in the booth next to his albums!"}
{"text":"Menu is great, everything looks delicious! I ordered the Italia Benny's and was surprised to taste a spicy hollandaise - turns out they put cayenne pepper in the sauce. I'm not a big fan of spice so I found it to be too much, but my boyfriend loved it. Service was OK; very nice hostess, but the server wasn't around much."}
{"text":"Came across this place as I was driving by. I've been back 2 more times. Great food and great service at a reasonable cost."}
{"text":"This restaurant completely satisfied me. It has so many unique kinds of eggs Benedict on the menu and has wonderful hours. 
The only recommendation I could make would be to add something to the hollandaise sauce. I don't know exactly what it needs but it needs something.
Another comment a family member of mine had was that the eggs in the eggs Benedict need to be runny. I like my eggs hard and that's how they came but my family like there's runny. 
Other than that... delicious :)"}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere, great portions, unique menu, fantastic food and pleasant staff.  Well worth the trek to get here. 5*"}
{"text":"Fabulous 50s decor with red vinyl and chrome booths and chairs. The 50s music was fun too. Service is friendly and attentive. They were more than willing to accommodate substitutions in the menu. We even got our own cool pot of coffee for our brunch today.

A fun menu selection from lite fare to a heavy breakfast. Everything tasted very fresh and well cooked.

I also appreciated the rectangular outlay of the place as even with a table of 10 sitting next to us, the noise levels were low as compared to other breakfast places.

There was also no line up on a Sunday morning! That may not last as this place becomes more popular.

I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"A modern take on a classic diner. Put away the greasy spoon and call your goody friends. The eggs benny were amazing and the benny burger is large and in charge. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I have been here three times and though the decor is fun I found the food to be very average. I'm a celiac and gluten free waffles and pancakes were a huge disappointment. The portions were ridiculously large and the flavor was boring in both cases. They advertise that vanilla was in both and I found it to be quite lacking. The pancakes were very doughy and there were so many that I was to take home enough for 2 more meals. The fruit mixture was very good but I don't like whipped cream so I had it without. When I had scrambled eggs on my first visit they were very good. I may try the restaurant again but I ll stay away from the gluten free specialties"}
{"text":"This is an enjoyable \"blast from the past\" place to appreciate a great breakfast in an atmosphere that brings back happy memories.

The service and food was great!

To bring an even more immersed experience would be to have the staff dress  in attire to match the decor and ambience.

We'll totally be back again!"}
{"text":"Cool 50's style diner breakfast and lunch place. Red and white sparkly vinyl booths, Elvis and Marylin Monroe decor, and old magazine ads spread throughout.

Their menu has traditional options like omelettes, waffles, and the \"benny breakfast\" which consists of eggs, toast, bacon, and sausage. Then they have some non traditional items too like The ESB which has mini pirogies sausage and eggs. They also have lunch items. Breakfast will run you around $15 per meal plus drinks.

What I like about places like these is that I can get a no nonsense breakfast. While places like OEB and Monki are great, sometimes you just want some bacon and eggs and toast. You get in, eat, and get out without a fuss.

These guys are locally owned too which is great to support a small business. It also means that they're getting many things locally like the Spoumbo's sausage they serve.

So far so good. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"We came to visit Benny's on the last leg of my 3rd trimester. The restaurants is very retro and the menu is filled with homages to old singers/celebrities, which is quite cute.

It was a Sunday and it seemed like the restaurant was sufficiently busy and there were tons of families with little kids which is a plus for me!

We ordered an Elvis Presley, Marilyn Monroe, 2 Cowboy Breakfasts, Benny's breakfast bowl and eggs benedict with Montreal smoked meat.

We all tried each other's plates like always(were all family so it's all good) and we liked all the plates, I mean how can someone screw up eggs and sausages? We really had no complaints with the food, and the service was amazing. 

I wouldn't mind coming back to Benny's now that my baby is almost 3 months old(she's not eating any of the food there though, so too bad for her)."}
{"text":"It's awesome place love it...thats all I can say.
My sis had the one with steak she didn't really like it

The strawberry shake is really good thick and there's strawberry bits.

Poached eggs were good lots of potatoes with sausages and onion with bacon.

Very satisfying. It also comes with fruit...bonus

Their soda are all in bottles."}
