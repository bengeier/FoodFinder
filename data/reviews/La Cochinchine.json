{"text":"My hubby and I moved into the neighborhood a few months ago and decided to give Cochinchine a try.  We were not at all disappointed in the quality of the food or the ambiance.  We have been there many times since and have never had a bad meal.  I see a lot of people complaining about the service, but they do seem to be getting a lot better.  Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with my recent experience here! I have been there a few times and always thought the service was really bad. I ordered take out today and the container they put it in literally fell apart and my food fell all over the floor when I took it out of the bag. They charged me $4 extra for 4 shrimp. So a $16 dish in the garbage! I called back to see if they could replace it and they would not, I asked to speak with the manager. She said he was too busy to talk, when I asked when I could call back, she rudely hung up the phone on me! I would not recommend this place to anyone because of A-the terrible service b- their terrible committment to customer service and C- their outrageous prices to add something extra"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the nice decor and the big Buddha statue.  We ordered Vietnamese rolls as appetizer, with a very tasty dipping sauce.  Then we had spicy chicken and spicy beef noodle soup.  The food was served relatively quickly, and they gave generous portions and tasty.  Should have asked if they use MSG cause had unquenchable thirst afterwards.  All in all a pleasant eating experience, the worst aspect being an entire hour of Zamfir panpipe music in the background.  A few Zamphir pieces are great, but an entire album of the same music is very monotonous, almost irritating.  A mix of musics would have been nice."}
{"text":"What the heck is a Cochinchine? Apparently a region of South Vietnam that was a French colony until 1948.
Well, that would explain the odd name.
This has to be one of the nicest decorated Vietnamese restaurants in Calgary. Dark woods, yellow lit hues, cool light fixtures, clean & rather trendy, it's really a departure from what Vietnamese restaurants usually are. It's really delightful to be able to have Vietnamese food without plastic fruit or artificial flowers or cheap art adorning the walls.
That being said, it was quite a night of hit and misses.
It was a freezing night and the restaurant was quite chilly inside. It was an excuse to drink more of the tasty tea I suppose. We asked for our orders in a specific succession...to start with the beef salad rolls, followed by a Vietnamese coconut-rice-paper crepe dish followed lastly by sate beef noodle soup.
Well, they brought out everything at once.
By the time we got to the soup, we noticed that they had given us the sate chicken instead so we sent it back.
While the food itself was decent, it wasn't knock-your-socks off tasty. I'd go back sometimes but I'd rather go up the street to Pho Huong Viet Noodle House at 38th & 17th Ave. Their beef sate soup is just completely divine."}
{"text":"Good food. Good atmosphere. Rice vermicelli bowls are as good as Tamarine or Lemongrass. Servers are a little standoffish. Otherwise would recommend."}
{"text":"This is a pretty basic vietnamese place trying to be too westernized. The food is ok, the service is less than ok, and the decor is really nice. Personally, I prefer authentic asian cusine at hide away locations, and this place is just too main stream for me, but it will do.

It's very clean and has a lot of tables. No visual complaints at all! They do a pretty decent take out menu but I don't believe the deliver."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, and the first time, something honestly threw me off and actually worried me a little. If you order a \"regular\" Pho, you get a bowl barely 1/2 the size of what most Pho restaurants serve as the regular - looking around, their large is served in what most places call a regular.

That being said, they didn't skimp on anything. They filled the bowl as full as they possibly could, and the soup was delicious. I'd happily return and eat here any time. They make some very, very good soup."}
