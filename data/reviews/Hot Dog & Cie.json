{"text":"I give 5 stars for the concept and the execution of this fine canine establishment.  I came by a day after opening to inquire about the business and to \"feel out\" the cafe before bringing my pooch.  What I found was a very passionate manager who gave us a tour of the facilities.  Hot Dog Cafe is a one-stop shop for all your canine (and human) needs.  It features an indoor dog park, a kennel, grooming (there is an option for a cat bath, too), and of course, there is the cafe part.  It is beautifully decorated and there's free wifi to boot!  Each seating area indoors has a place for your furry friend to lounge, and the outdoor terrace has some nice seats for those who like basking in the sun and those (who like me) prefer the shade. Oh, and there is even an artificial-grass-lined bathroom for your canine companion!  Very innovative.  The Cafe itself offers soups, sandwiches, desserts, hot dogs (of course), and even has a variety of alcoholic beverages.  There are some television screens so we're hoping that we can catch the game here with our pup.  I ordered a mochachino, which was pretty delicious.  My fiance ordered a hot dog platter, which was excellent. We had a choice of sausage and it came with a side of special mayo and fries.  The bread and sausage quality were great.  Even the cutlery and pepper-grinder were \"fancy\"... the owners went all out on this place, and it shows!  Finally, the really important part: my dog had a great time! My pup is very friendly but a bit shy around assertive/aggressive dogs, but the staff and other patrons helped him feel at home.  If you eat in the cafe, your dog will be treated to a stylish bowl of water and maybe even a little treat.  The waitress came by and gave my little guy a little biscuit, which I'm sure he really loved!  All in all, a great place.  I'll be taking my pup for his first grooming experience here so I'll post an update about that soon.  I love this place so much that I'll be going back today!"}
{"text":"Si vous êtes amoureux de chien comme moi vous allez adorer les Hot Dog Café! Service extraordinaire, le personnelle est attentionné et serviable et on voit qu'ils adore les animaux. Les prix sont très compétitif avec les autres et je trouve que si les prix sont un peu plus cher ça en vaut bien la peine avec se qu'ils offre. La seule bémol la bouffe n'est super.... Mais si c'est juste pour profiter de la terrasse avec un bon drink ou verre de vin c'est la place parfaite pour passer du temps avec votre animal de compagnie."}
{"text":"Super concept ! Nous sommes venu en famille et tout le monde s' est amusés. La deco est tres jolie,  les menus design, les toutous sont rois avec gamelle d'eau et couverture. Le parc pour les chiens est super, un espace pour les grands et les petits chien. Il y a toujours des employés pour surveiller et nettoyer. D'ailleurs tout le restaurant est propre !  Le menu est simple,  c'est bon ... sans plus.. on y vient surtout pour le decor et l'ambiance.  Un vrai bonheur pour nous tous !"}
{"text":"Went there today and a man hit his dog twice!!!  The atmosphere changed drastically and not one employee had the nerve to approach him. So I spoke to the manager and their reasoning was because the owners wouldn't care and wouldn't allow them to ask someone to leave!! Great place!!!!!! Never going back for that reason. To allow idiots to abuse their animals publicly is disgusting! Shame on you hot dog cafe for not standing up for the animals you claim to love...not sure about that anymore."}
{"text":"A restaurant you can bring your dog to. Their near flawless execution of this unique concept merits at least 4 stars. I really want to give them a 5th, but their (human) food is very disappointing. Thankfully, their breakfast is on par with what's offered at the other breakfast joints in the area."}
{"text":"Love this concept!! Bring you doggy to eat with you. Passed by this place and had to go in!! Everything is modern, & clean.  At each table there is a metal ring you can tie your dogs chain to.  If you don't want to eat but have errands to run, you can leave them with the indoor dog park workers for a low cost of 3$ an hour. This place is also a kennel that actually let's your dog play all day instead of being stuck in a cage till you get back! If you want your dog washed and pampered, they do that too! Love it!  The food was also surprisingly good considering it is a doggy restaurant. I didn't have the wine but I saw a lot of woman holding their dogs in their laps and enjoying the terrace with a nice glass of wine.  Will return! If you are a proud parent of a 4 legged baby! Check it out!"}
{"text":"We wish we had more time to enjoy this dog café. It's a bit of a drive from downtown Montréal, but with a dog in tow for the weekend, it seemed like a good place to hang out together as a family. We were not disappointed.  Coming in, the host gave us a run-down of how it worked after we confirmed we had never been there before. Basically, your pup can stay with you while you dine (as in a regular restaurant, complete with alcohol and everything). Your pup gets a blanket, a bowl of water, and you can tie them up fairly close to you. If you choose not to have your pup at the table, you can send them off to the indoor dog park where they can run around for a reasonable rate of 5$/hr; prorated if you end up staying less or more (you can also watch your dog play from a television in the dining area). Or you can have them groomed on-site. It's definitely a good one-stop shop for dog and master.  Personally, I wasn't that impressed with the dog park - if only because there were way too many dogs (at least when we went). They did try to separate the big dogs and small dogs, but in my opinion, that still wasn't enough space. Also, because there's only glass separating dog and master, what ended up happening was that the dogs congregated by the windows looking for their owners and barking at them to get them out. There were more than a few stressed dogs in there, that's for sure.   As for our pup (a small dog), she quite enjoyed sitting with us at the table. I can see how large dogs may not have as much space (even on the floors), but I think it's doable. There is also patio-seating on nice warmer days. Servers also give out treats to dogs (on top of food you might or might not share with them), so as far as I'm concerned, your pups should have nothing to complain about...  Their food was pretty decent, although we did find the wait a bit long. We had already eaten brunch before our visit, so I ordered dessert - the crème brûlée, while my partner had the poutine (with meat). Our friends, who came to check out the place with us, ordered drinks. The food was delicious (albeit the dessert was a little runny); more so than we expected from this restaurant, that's for sure. Service was also very friendly, even though slow.   Our experience with dog cafés generally puts emphasis on the \"dog\" part of the visit, and oftentimes neglects all other aspects. It's good to know that Hot Dog Café strives to meet both the \"pet-friendly\" part as well as the \"restaurant\" part of their business.  We'll definitely try to come back if we're in town. As for Ottawans reading this review - can I say - Great Franchise Idea! (Cause we totally need one!)"}
{"text":"Was in Montreal for the weekend and was brought here for lunch by a friend. This place is unique and I wish they had a place like this in Ottawa. The restaurant is dog friendly. Your dog is able to sit with you inside next to the table. They have their own little area around/near the table and receive a dish of water and blanket to sit on.  I had one of their cocktails (Long Island Iced Tea) and it was very delish! Since it was a very hot day it was the perfect drink. I tried some poutine to and that to was very yummy, the gravy was very tasty, fries crunchy and the curds melty.   Overall I was very impressed with the whole atmosphere, they even had a bathroom for the doggies! It was a patch of enclosed grass area that they could do their business. If you are ever in the Montreal area and looking for a dog friendly restaurant you should definetly check it out!"}
{"text":"Belle place, propre et bien organisé. Abordable, pratique, conviviale. Service de garde et forfaits disponibles."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever!!! Do not leave your dogs un the dog park. I left my dog in the dog park and the lady who was guarding hit my dog in the neck many times and throw him on the flior! The reason the staff gave me was because my dog was jumping on others, which was not the truth, since i was sitting in front of the glass wall and watching during the whole time."}
