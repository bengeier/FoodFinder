{"text":"We popped by for some take out. We ordered a good selection of items. The lemon chicken was good. The batter was nice and crispy and nice white meat. The lemon sauce was quite runny so I was a bit concerned but after tasting it the flavor was all there. Chicken balls, general tso chicken, fried rice and egg rolls we're all tasty as well.

There is no room to eat inside, only take out."}
{"text":"Very good little Mom &Pop shop serving the Carp area.  Typical Chinese take-out menu with all the traditional Canadian/Chinese choices.  The open ended eggrolls are very good as is the Valley Fried Rice.

If you want to personalize your order they are open to requests like \" fewer onions\" or \" No MSG\""}
{"text":"Having just moved to Carp, we are still slowly checking out the resources. We ordered for pickup four dishes, a couple of spring rolls and open end egg rolls. The order was ready for pickup in under 20 minutes.
Heather thought the lemon chicken sauce was a little thin but the flavour was very good. 
I have found open end egg rolls to be rather rarely offered by take out restaurants. This may perhaps be because they can hold so much cooking oils and fats but this is not the case with these... They were very good. 
Overall, very very good."}
{"text":"There is nothing  wrong with the food. Its consistent and they have some tasty dishes that stand out from typical \"Chinese food\" . However, I always have it delivered but recently  I went  to pick up my take out and I couldn't believe the atrocity inside. It was absolutely disgusting. It is filthy inside ! Boxes and garbage everywhere. Dust/cobwebs /grease all over the walls and counter. But the nastiest/saddest thing was the fish tank! They've got a fish tank with- I kid you not - dark brown water that is opaque. You cant see an inch past the glass. There are poor fish in there and I counted 4 different fish floating around almost dead. I couldn't believe it. Gnarliest place you've ever seen and you've gotta question that kitchen.... Absolutely turned off and will not be back."}
