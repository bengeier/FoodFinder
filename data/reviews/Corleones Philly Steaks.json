{"text":"Even though I thought I had pressed the 'place order' button on GrubHub, they let me re-place my order in the store when I went to go pick it up without charging me. When I got back to my computer, I had put incorrect credit card information in it! So I placed the order again. Thank you guys for understanding that I made a mistake! Even though it was my fault, you took ownership of it, and made it right. Talk about customer service! On the other hand, I have never had a cheesesteak sandwich, and this was the BOMB! I will be back, many, many times!"}
{"text":"Great food but you probably don't want to go there for a lunch break they take forever, they messed up my order and took even longer."}
{"text":"I eat here about once every two weeks for lunch. The food is exceptional and the people are very very nice. I went to college in Philadelphia and live there for 10 years, this is the closest to a Philly cheesesteak I've had. Nice atmosphere, fast service comma Rocky always playing on the TVs. What else can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Best cheesesteak I've had! 2 for one on Tuesdays after 4:30pm. Can't bet this place,  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"It's OK. Decent Phillies and cheese fries. The pizza is overpriced. They have bogo sandwiches on Tuesdays after 4pm."}
{"text":"Great #1 sandwich...love the \"WIZ\" on it more than anything.

Go to visit EVERY time I am in Scottsdale on business...order staff sometimes seems disinterested/distracted at times...but it is probably because it is hectic at all times I am there.

Atmosphere is good, decor is good, TV's going, Food is GREAT...Add Sweet Tea to drink options"}
{"text":"Some days I would rate Corleones 5 stars, and some days 1 star, so I setteled in the middle.  I wish the cooks were more consistent.  I always order a cheeze steak sandwich.  The one guy who I think is now a manager used to always cook - he is the best cook by far.  Some of the other cooks are bad, and some are ok, but the manager guy is BY  FAR the best.  I don't know what he does to that sandwich that makes it soooo good.  

I go here quite a bit and the service is always the same - you place your order, they call your number when its up - not too fancy but it works."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly service! Yo can't go wrong with their Tuesday special, BOGO after 4pm. Come get the Wit!"}
{"text":"First time eating here for lunch and I wasn't very impressed. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and may try them again knowing that I did not have any of their specialties or known for items like a Philly sandwich. I had the anti-pasta salad and it was probably the worst I've ever had. I threw 3/4 of it away. Plus the restaurant dining area itself was very dirty there wasn't a clean table to be found the ice machine had ice piled up all over dripping everywhere, there were no forks and the floors were gross."}
{"text":"They have the best Philly chz steak sandwiches & fries ever!  There fries are thebomb.com!"}
{"text":"Corleone's is a chain steak and cheese joint found in several places around the valley. The steak and cheese hogies are pretty good.  You can get the traditional whiz or another cheese of your liking. I like to add mushrooms which are an option. The fries changed from their original form and aren't as good as they were before. Those from Philly will be disappointed but a nice option for the rest of us."}
{"text":"Moved to the valley from Philly. Best cheesesteaks. As anyone from Philly will tell you, it all comes down to the bread. I am a wiz with (Cheese Wiz with fried onions). For the full Philly experience, get the Tastykakes too."}
{"text":"Over priced pizza for the quality I was not impressed at all. The service is a little strange too. I wouldn't recommend but I would eat there if it was the only place around."}
{"text":"Very good cheese steaks, best in AZ. I do not know why they only have 3 stars. This place gets my business at least once a week. It is a little pricy but its not terrible if you dont get fries and a drink, just get a water cup or something."}
{"text":"This place is the BEST Cheesesteak I've had since moving here from. S Jersey. They know how to keep the line moving pretty fast. The sandwiches are really good and we've ordered here plenty of times personally and for my staff. They've always gotten the orders correct!  in over two years we've never had anything be wrong. 

I always get the combo and just found out you can sub salad for fries if you want for a few cents more. Honestly that seems crazy BUT a nice option. Sometimes they have Tastycakes which I LUV! The environment is great with a rocky movie playing at all times. One great touch....the men's room has a Dallas Cowboys sticker in the urinal. (You will only understand how priceless this is if you're a die hard EAGLES fan) 
I think it's impossible to get the same style bread I grew up on anywhere here in AZ. So like many of us from the Delaware Valley we all had our favorite cheesesteak place. But Corleone's does a real nice job and gets close to steaks I grew up on and that's worth the 5star rating!

{"text":"Excellent food! I love the menu selections and they'll customize any order just how you like it! Everyone has their own toppings preferences and there are endless toppings to choose from!!"}
{"text":"I tried this place because I had a coupon.  It's tasty but very greasy.  I couldn't bring myself to eat it with the cheese wiz but it was tasty with mushrooms and peppers.  Definitely not on the healthier side."}
{"text":"I've eaten here many times and it's always great. pizza is great and cheese steaks are excellent! (I always order mine with provolone cheese because the cheese wiz is not for me). Happy eating."}
{"text":"I ordered a cheesesteak and cheesesteak fries at 10:44am, and they were delivered at 12:46pm. The cheesesteak was cold and instead of cheesesteak fries, they brought me a side of fries and a Dixie cup of cheese. The receipt on the bag says cheese fries when my receipt from grubhub clearly says cheesesteak fries.

The one in the Biltmore was my first positive cheese steak experience outside of PA, but this location is a total disappointment."}
{"text":"Corleone's has improved over time so I thought it would be a good idea to update my initial review.

The cheesesteak with whiz is still pretty darn good.  The Little Joey now seems to have a fair amount of meat and is a nice change from the original, have them add fresh onion in addition to the lettuce and tomato and it is extra delicious (and not too onion-y).  I've been getting their Italian Hoagie lately too - love it.  They make a great white pie and good pizza overall. I've had great luck with the Sicilian slices too, they're always fresh and have a nice golden crust. I still don't like the coated fries.

They deliver quickly and are still generous with coupons which is nice.  I am also happy to see they redesigned their website, got rid of that awful flash and replaced it with an easy to navigate site with online ordering.

One suggestion, please allow the user to shut off the floating menu.  It's one of those lame web development ideas that never should have seen the light of day."}
{"text":"I believe I found my favorite Philly Cheesesteak place outside of Philly.

I love how they talk smack about Pats and Genos if thats all you can reference in terms of Cheesesteak spots in Philadelphia.  The place is clean and pictures and posters remind you of the Philadelphia experience.

Food wise, this is the closest as it can be towards Philly Style cheesesteaks.  I have no idea why the other places here do not offer cheese whiz when we are talking cheesesteaks but this place does and it is fantastic!  The meat is as it should be, not salty at all!  Somehow they fit all the fixings I asked for with a good amount of meat in their bread. (Mushrooms, tomatos, green peppers, oninons)  And yes, the sloppier the better!

I also tried a pizza slice but it was nothing special.  It's good if you are into the east coast kind of pizza, but for me I've had my share when it comes to that.  The pizza was nice and crisp and tastes awesome right out of the oven.  It's great if you craving it but if you are looking for something unique and one of a kind, then you are better off going somewhere that doesn't serve street food.

Food service was prompt and quick.  I waited for about 15 minutes but can't blame the staff when customers in front of you order 5 or 6 cheesesteaks each.  Pricing is really good, you could get a foot long cheese steak for less than $10.  Cheese pizza slice is about $2.50.  and their variation of french fries is about $5.  Definitely well worth my time and money to spend at this place."}
{"text":"We visit this Corleone's regularly and it is absolutely awesome if you are looking for authentic East Coast sandwiches and pizza. Cheesesteak experts will not be disappointed, and the pizza is stellar.  And the service is always fast, friendly, and excellent. 

I highly recommend Corleone's, and if you're not in North Scottsdale, there are three additional locations - Mill Ave in Tempe, 16th St and Camelback, and Tatum and Shea."}
{"text":"This is pure Philly in Arizona.  Having been to Philly a fair number of times, I enjoy a solid cheesesteak, and this is where I go to grab one in Arizona.

There is only one problem.  Though not as bad as it used to be, there were a few guys working the counter that were complete jackasses.  Yes, I understand it is a place to grab a Philly cheesesteak, but I don't want a side order of Philly attitude, I get that enough watching Eagles games with some of my friends.

On the plus side, they recently merged with an old pizza place that used to serve the best pies in the area and they now sell his recipe pizzas and they are amazing!

Food is good, but some of the older workers at the place need to check their Philly attitudes at the door."}
{"text":"If you want an authentic Philly cheesesteak \"wit wiz\", this is a great spot to get one.  And there aren't very many in the AZ!"}
{"text":"This place was decent. The reason I say decent is because I ordered the Original philly with chicken and it was a bit dry and bland. Granted, this is my first time here so I'm basing this review of off first impression. 
The customer service wasn't bad and the pizza looked delicious, thin crust New York style. I should've ordered the pizza instead. I will give this place a second chance and try the pizza. If the pizza is impressive I might raise my rating to 4 stars, just didn't really enjoy my first impression supposedly known for their Philly."}
{"text":"We just went to Corleone's and were extremely disappointed to discover that they had raised their prices.  Their pizza used to be a lot less expensive and only a little bit less good than other nearby pizza options.  Now, they have raised the pizza price by $2 so we'll be going back to Ray's or NYPD for our takeout pizza.  The pizza still tastes the same and really is pretty good but if the price isn't going to be good, I'd rather have really good pizza than pretty good pizza."}
{"text":"There are few places where you can score a dynamite Philly cheesesteak in the valley and this is one of them. Great phillies and pizza and always at a great price. 

Bonus: Free delivery!! Don't forget to tip your driver for the delish food."}
{"text":"Most excellent. 
Nothing like A steak sandwich. French fries are perfect. 
Free refills on all soda. Very nice. 
Also very clean.  Restrooms are very clean. 
You really get you're moneys worth."}
{"text":"E for effort, they give it a good try, good piece of meat but i watched helpless, as it was cooked to.....to....o i hope the wiz can save it. ..... it did, it always does.  i grew up on these ingenious delights and sometimes you just have to have one.  and please some one who knows tell me about.... Corleone's  why the godfather name?, and references? New York yes! , Philly .....No, had to ask they couldn't tell me, and the question lingers. anyway the staff was very friendly and i got my food fast and fresh. fries were nothing special but again nothing the wiz couldn't fix ( so i love wiz you would understand so i won't try and explain) the cheez fries are loaded wit it."}
{"text":"Fries were pretty good, crispy but the original cheesesteak, I thought was awful. 
The restaurant is a little dingy, unkept, the doors were grimy as was the carpet etc.,so not a good sign, should have walked away."}
{"text":"Honestly... Just not very good. Yeah, everything looks good but the food is flavorless. The Philly steak is bland and seems almost mass produced. The pizza slices were old and nasty as they had probably been sitting around for hours. Actually had a fresh pie the other day at a kids birthday party and the sauce is pasty and the crust us thick and heavy for a supposed NY style.  Overall, not nearly as good as the reviews say, disappointed and will not return."}
{"text":"Greats sandwiches and pizza...Best Philly steak n cheese in Scottsdale..Go on tuesdays it's buy one get one free..Always good service...Always playing a Rocky movie..."}
{"text":"For lunch today we went to Corleone's, a Philly cheese-steak joint, located south of the Ultimate Electronics, along the north side of Butherus; just west of Hayden.

We've driven by them for years and we were never swayed by their signage and marketing...kinda francheesy.  I've read the other Yelp posts on the place, and I can see right away that many reviewers have never had a real, traditional Philly cheese-steak.  Don't get me wrong, real...doesn't mean quality.  In fact, the real-deal in Philly is a greasy, bready, Cheez Whiz laden beast with over-grilled onions.  You've really got to like the-whole Philly package to get into Corleone's, as they do their best to deliver an authentic sandwich.  My feeling is that the best of Philadelphia actually put more Cheez Whiz on the sandwich, which can be a-bit much....but hey, how can you argue with tradition?

Corleone's is a bit pricey at first-brush and they try to nickel-and-dime you if you want to customize your sandwich.  However, their two-for-1 special, everyday from 4-6pm, makes up for it; that, and kids eat free on Saturdays.  The restaurant was clean, and the menu simple to understand; though, oddly, many drink accessories (straws, etc.) are too high for children to reach. The atmosphere is simple with three televisions flickering; with three different programs...including one with Rocky III.

After discussing it with the family, we give Corleone's a 3 to 3.5.  The food was authentic, and the service was very good; for a food-counter joint."}
{"text":"I think this is the best cheese steak you can get from a chain.  The bread is always fresh and the meat is cooked well.  The staff could be a little more friendly but I guess that's pushing it."}
{"text":"Some of the best \"fast food\" ever! I work at the parts store next door and we always go to Corleones for food. They always get it right and is always super fresh and tasty! I get the chicken or/l steak philly or the Italian Hoagie! They are all so good and the people that work there are amazing and super nice!"}
{"text":"My coworkers went there last week and they brought me Philly cheese stake sandwich and i have to say it was delicious and tasty!!!
I went there the other other day to try it again and let me say that I can make a better cheese stake sandwich at home, not the same. 
I can't go back and pay $12 bucks for another one sorry!

EA"}
{"text":"Sadly the competition has died down over the years, but Corleone's has stood the test of time as the best (and only) cheesesteak joint in Scottsdale. No, Charley's does not count.

No matter what side of the debate you're on, you can find the winning side here. You got your whiz, your provolone, grilled onions or raw, plus all your typical add-ons like peppers mushrooms and more. Hell, if you even wanna be extra crazy you can even make a Philly Taco with some of the solid pizza slices they have here as well. But either way, the chicken/steak will be super tender, with a soft roll guaranteeing the classic bite you always want.

The battered fries are some of the best combo fries I've had, plus they got onion rings too. I actually do like their wings, but find it weird the Yelp and Doordash menus don't list them anymore when you can still order them in store. 

It's definitely not the best cheesesteak I've ever had, but it's a damn good one that beats a meal out of all the fast food joints nearby. I'll keep stopping by whenever I'm craving the classic wit."}
{"text":"Even a Dallas Cowboys fan knows where to get a real cheese steak I and would never go to Philly so it's Corleones for me a cheese steak and whizz is as close to Philly as I want to get! Got my free cheese steak and a managers discount on another. Yo Adrian have the Mick bring me some takeout !!!"}
{"text":"My first trip June 2013. I got The Original, small. A 'Wiz Wit' as they call it, means a steak sandwich with onions and cheesewiz. There are of course choices on the toppings. 
Took about six minutes from order to ready. Place your order at the register, clearly labeled for the first timer like me. There's tables and benches to dine on. I guess they also deliver. Hours were 1030am to about 10pm. I should have photographed the sign in the window. This is one of those companies that keeps their hours a secret online on their web page. (I promise I won't tell anyone!)

I've never had an authentic steak sandwich before, only seen them on PBS TV shows. The legendary Philly places, Pat's and Geno's use sliced rib-eye. Corleone's uses small chunks instead. Mine was a little lite on the onions. Like the TV reviews said, the combo of Wiz and Steak and onions on a hoagie roll works well. It's a decent sandwich. I'll likely go back for more. Service and atmosphere was also well done. Kitchen staff appeared motivated and hard working. The place was very clean looking.

On the down side, which is just my personal feelings... first let me say when I eat burgers I never never order cheese because the cheese overwhelms the flavor of the burger. The same is true for the Wiz Wit. 

Food served in plastic baskets, self serve drinks. All in all I had a nice, quick, inexpensive lunch. Well worth the trip.

Location: sort of between Costco and Sam's Club just off Northsight. You can enter from the back end of the Costco lot too. Be sure to check out their menu online before driving over."}
{"text":"Food is good here, bad place for the healthy conscious eater though! Although place is clean, sort of a fun atmosphere, and food is pretty good, only 3 stars because it seems overpriced. By the time you get a combo (Sandwich, fries, drink), it comes out to be 12 bucks or so. That's sit-down restaurant prices for me. So, given the high calorie content (yeah... they do have salads, but who goes to a Philly Cheese Steak joint for a salad), and overpriced menu, I'll limit myself to maybe twice a year or so, or even less."}
{"text":"Simply the best for authentic ny style pizza or Philly cheesesteak. Staff is nice, service is quick, and the food is consistent every time. Prices are fair, but they do have coupons and such to lower things a bit. Can't recommend this place enough. It's my new favorite joint. Surprised there isn't a line out the door for this stuff.

If you're from the north east, you owe it to yourself to stop by."}
{"text":"Must be a new guy cooking or they just don't do the cheesesteak consistently. Grabbing my free bday sandwich today, the food came out totally different than my last visit. On that visit, the cheese was properly folded into the meat, but today chef lazybones just put two slices of cheese unmelted on the bread and ladled the meat on top of the cheese. Totally different taste, but it was free, so had to let it go. Maybe next time, real chef will return."}
{"text":"Corleone's has been our family restaurant for the past 4+ years. The owner is the best! No matter which location you choose, the quality is the same; excellent. To anyone looking for quality cheesesteaks, or pizza, stop in at Corleone's."}
{"text":"We enjoy the food and like that they offer delivery to our area, but they SHOULDNT! The restaurant is 10 minutes from our home, but our food takes over 2 hours to show up... actually I'm writing this and I haven't even received my order yet. A sub-par cheese steak is not worth all this. At least have the decency to call and apologize or even let us know there would be such a long wait I would have cancelled the order long ago!"}
{"text":"Corleone's is a good place for lunch - not sure of the \"Philly\" touches as I've never spent any time there!  Have only had their signature Philly Cheese Steak sandwich (without the cheese) when there - good every time - excellent steak with grilled onions.  My only complaint is that it is pricey for a lunch place - $12 for the combo lunch (includes fries and drink) - making it a pricey lunch for two!"}
{"text":"I'm giving Corleone's five stars even though they do run a little slow on delivery. I've ordered from here many times, and live very close by. It always takes about an hour. It is worth it, though. 

I really enjoy the Chicken Pizza Steak and the grilled vegetable sandwich! Other favorites of the household include the Italian Hoagie, Philly Cheese Steak, and awesome cheese pizza.

Their portions are generous, and the food itself has a quality to it that isn't matched by competitors in the area. 

They do have fries (contrary to another review on Yelp) and they are delicious."}
{"text":"Just moved here from Philly, and the steak sandwich I had was pretty good. The meat, onions, and prov were all as they should be, but the roll was either not an Amoroso's or they get soft on the trip to AZ. Overall it was pretty good-- similar to Jim's on South (but without the cocaine). The photos on the wall were cool and reminded me of home.

I wish you guys still sold soft pretzels! I'd be in there every week."}
{"text":"I will not order from this Corleones again, every time they forget my ranch and didn't even put it on my buffalo chicken sandwich or the other 4 that I ordered but still labeled each sandwich \"ranch\" they charged me for 4 sides of ranch and didn't bring it so when I called to tell them the lady on the phone told me to tell them next time not to charge me, it took an hour and half to get our food and it was soggy and cold when it got to me, disappointed"}
{"text":"The pizza is great but the service sucks my dealership has been ordering from Corleone's for a long time now and the service has just gotten worse and worse usually takes an hour and a half for delivery by the time you get your pizza it's ice cold whoever's running this joint should know that their staff is taking down their restaurant"}
{"text":"Not terrible.  Overpriced for sure.  Go see Doug at Pomeroy's for a much better Philly cheese."}
{"text":"Cheesesteaks should never be soggy.  It's the age old problem, the bread has to come from the East Coast.  Steak was okay, a bit greasy, and the whiz was an important touch... that's just how they are made... but the bread was a let down and was soggy enough to drop most of the steak out of the bottom half way through the meal.  I miss Jim's and Sonny's in Philly."}
{"text":"I eat here quite often and they are aways great. Sign up for their mailing list, they have some great coupons to go with their delicious sandwiches. 

I usually get an original whiz wit. Initially I thought this cheese whiz idea was insane and would never want that, but one time it accidentally came on my sandwich and I didn't have time to get it fixed. It's awesome! I wouldn't eat another original without it...if they tried to give me a sandwich without it, I'd grab out of the cans of cheese by the front door, bite my way through the top, and pour on the glorious whiz myself!

I also recommend the Italian and turkey sandwiches. Both great!

Come on a Tuesday night for buy one get one free regular sandwich night!"}
{"text":"Well it's a little out of the way but it is really good. I've now eaten here three times and I have to say I love it. I miss the place they had on Shea and Tatum. I use to go to that location about 2 times a month. But I love cheesesteak so I find myself going at least once a week now.
The the service is great the food is so good so you almost can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I am not a huge fan of Philly Cheesesteaks but have to say they get my vote and will be in my rotation of foods being served for my company lunches.

Great service!"}
{"text":"Best cheese pizza for the price, hands down. Wings are good too. Fast delivery...what more can you ask for. Definitely a go to for inexpensive good food."}
{"text":"As a regular of Corleones at the Biltmore, I was very disappointed with this location. There were 4 total customers in the restaurant, 2 of them being my husband and I. There were four employees working while we were there for lunch today. Clearly none of them thrilled to be there. The woman who works the register was unfriendly and clearly unmotivated. There was not one clean table in the restaurant despite how slow they were. In fact, she had come out from behind the counter once to push some chairs, but did not clean the tables off until the time we were leaving. The pizza I ordered was not fresh at all and actually tasted completely different than what the other location serves. I think it must be a diff cheese along with the stale taste. They do not have lemons for their teas or water. My husband ordered a sandwich and it was also disappointing. I will never return to this location as it is seemingly unmanaged. The only thing that was positive was an employee (male, longer hair, red car) who was off duty getting in his car told us to have a nice day. Other than that gentleman, no one was welcoming whatsoever."}
{"text":"Corleone's is still the best Philly Cheese Steak, west of the Schuylkill River. 

I came here this evening with our oldest to enjoy a tasty treat.  Tuesday nights are BOGO on all sandwiches and it's been a while since we both were here together. A Father and Daughter bonding exercise. 

We ordered the same thing, except differently. I had the Beef, and she had the Chicken. Oh, and a Cheese Fries chaser. Both were delicious, but we must be getting old, since we each took half home. LOL

But as much as we enjoy the Cheese Steaks, we've found their pizza to be outstanding. If UR use to that thin, east coast floppy cheese pie, then this your piece of heaven. As I've noted, both NYPD and Ray's are good and nearby; but this is the genuine slice. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  It is definitely a little piece of Philly in Phoenix.  I can honestly say this is the only cheesesteak (outside of Philly) that is legit - amazingly fresh roll, Whiz, onions and the steak done just right.  And they sell Tastykakes too...bonus!"}
{"text":"Best philly cheese steak in Arizona. I use to think Geno's had the best until I ate here."}
{"text":"Generally pretty acceptable. Really bad experience this time. At least the toppings were cold so I didn't burn my fingers putting them on the pizza."}
{"text":"I'm from Philly and they have authentic cheese steaks and hoagies. Only place in az I will eat a cheese steak.. Ive tried several other places none even come close to this place.. They use the right rolls, right meat, and whiz and even have cherry hot peppers..."}
{"text":"One of the best places to get lunch in North Scottsdale. 

Their cheese steaks are so good and I never seem to get tired of them. They also have cheap, thin, pizza. 

Price wise, you'll probably pay about 10 bucks for a large sandwich, drink, and fries but that's the normal price for lunch in the area and definitely worth it.

Oh, and if you keep your receipt, you can use it as a coupon for your next meal."}
{"text":"I ordered the \"wiz\"  to go and was blown away. I had never had a Philly cheese steak sandwich with cheese whiz on it. It was so tasty. The sandwich was hot and the bread was soft and fresh. The french fries were good too. There's nothing fancy about this place, so don't go in there expecting that. We went in around lunch time and despite being crowded the service was pretty quick. The sandwich and fries were a bit pricey, over $10. I don't like paying that much for junk food, so i'll be an irregular regular. I considered the pizza, but it looked old and cold."}
{"text":"Wow, I just had the best Philly Steak sandwich. Great sandwich, guess when I come to work in Scottsdale will be oredered often."}
{"text":"The BEST place for cheesesteaks. Insane. And if you want cheesesteaks during 12:00PM and 1:30PM be prepared to wait but it's so worth it. 

I usually get the large cheesesteak with provolone and onion rings. The sandwich is huge and enough for two meals for me. The onion rings are the best I've had but I'm not a fan of their fries -- although my friends rave about them. 

This place gets packed during lunch hour and the Northsight area is already a mess during lunch hour. This place does delivery but there's a catch: they will take forever and your food will be cold. I don't think they take a long time because they're lazy, iI genuinely think it's because they are just so busy. 

They do have pizza and I've heard it's great but I just can't pass up their cheesesteaks every time I go. 

Most of the seating here is stools with pub-height tables and there are four booths. 

I've never had any problems with consistency like others have mentioned but it can be pricey. Like $25-$30 for two people if you both get larges and combos (fries/onion rings and a regular drink)."}
{"text":"I must have tried a not-so-good sandwich on this day, I mean everyone says the sandwiches here are good, but I honestly did not like mine. I got the steak sandwich with spinach. I had to skip the cheese bcz of my intolerance. I don't know if the sandwich would have tasted any better with the cheese but it was so dry, I kept feeling like I was going to choke on every bite. It really didn't have much flavor and the spinach I believe made it worse for me; it was just very bland. 

My colleague who got the classic was a bit more satisfied. My other colleague who got my sandwich but with cheese had a similar experience to mine. 

I got sweet tea with my sandwich. It's flavor was meh. I lived in the South before and I know what good sweet tea tastes like. 

I personally would not be going there again. Maybe if I was able to have wiz wit sandwiches, I would have had a much better experience!"}
{"text":"I've had cheesesteak from here twice - once a delivery from door dash and once I stopped in to check it out since my door dash was so yummy. I can't even come up with appropriate words for how delicious a cheesesteak can be! With or without wiz - your call - its delicious! The fries . . . How can fries stand out above others? Come here, and you'll find out! Whatever the trick is, keep it up, because its delicious!"}
{"text":"Don't order delivery!!!!!!!!! The kids on the phone are rude and disrespectful. I was quoted 25min and no show after an hour! I cancelled my order, not getting food from them again...

Wow, the food showed up about 15 min after my phone call to cancel. When I asked the delivery kid \"when he was sent out\"? He replied \"about 15 min ago\"....... 

Very disappointing...

Lost a loyal customer."}
{"text":"Absolutely disappointed in my experience here. The manager on staff today thought it would be ok to send my food out over half an hour ago (after already taking an hour and a half to arrive to me) as if I should eat it and get food poisoning. I called with my concern and the manager Richard could not have cared less (seems as though he hates his job). Now we are hungry, have no food being delivered, and I have to look for a refund on my card. 

The worst part of how complaisant and unconcerned the manger was when I politely called to inform him. Pending an email back from corporate to see if they plan on caring. 

Been a customer here for over 9 years!"}
{"text":"How on earth can this place only have three stars when they make a five star cheesesteak?"}
{"text":"Up until this past week it's been about four years since I've been to Corleone's. My wife ordered a chicken sandwich which she loved. So that was a major hurdle to satisfy the picky eater in the family.

 I had the sausage, greenpeppers and onions with the marinara sauce. Since I've been minimizing my consumption of bread lately, I just ate everything except the bun. The presentation of the meal is pretty impressive when you look at two large buns filled with stuff. But when you get into the meat of the meal you find that there's a lot more bun than meat. I have to say that I enjoyed the meal but thought the ratio of meat to bun was pretty weak.

I say this place is Yelped correctly at 3 1/2 stars."}
{"text":"I love cheese steak and Corleones is always delicious and great service.  The staff always goes out of the way to accommodate your wishes.  And they have great specials and a frequent buyers club."}
{"text":"Closest pizza to east coast (Philly, NJ, NY) version my wife and I have tried in the Valley and, believe me, we've been looking for 12 years. We've been back several times over the past couple months and consistently good. My wife swears the whole pie is better but have found the slices to be satisfying too. Will have to try a cheesesteak one of these times."}
{"text":"I've been in Scottsdale for the past 18 months.  Home was the North East, specifically Connecticut and Cape Cod, Massachusetts.  I've been to Philly numerous times and have a first hand experience with the original Cheese Wiz Philly Cheese steaks.  The people in Philly know a good cheese steak and don't compromise, it doesn't take a brain surgeon to appreciate that Philly is the home to authentic cheese steaks.

Corleones does a wonderful job to produce an authentic cheese steak.  My only complaint is that I've had a couple of issues, getting what I ordered.  On one occasion I received someone elses order and ended up with a Philly chicken steak instead of the beef cheese steak, not the worst mistake, just not what I ordered.

At the end of the day you get a great Philly steak sandwich with a healthy portion of beef and grilled onions.  A very good restaurant that strives to give its consumers what they want.  It's not easy to find back home town eastern flavor in a south western city."}
{"text":"Just got food from here for the first time and it is AMAZING!!!  Just don't plan on being healthy if you come here, this is purely authentic Philly comfort food. All that is missing is Rita's, which isn't too far away :)

I loved this place so much that with all the negative reviews on here I am left wondering if we all went to the same place???

First off I got my food through Grubhub (delivery). It actually was much faster than the predicted delivery time and the delivery person couldn't have been nicer. Only one complaint is that the pizza was cold but that's the beauty of delivery is that I was able to remedy that pretty easily. 
The pizza was the closest to real NY pizza that I have had here. The crust could have been a tad crunchier but it was delicious. Also loved that I could get just one slice like NY to make sure I liked it without being stuck with an entire pie. 
The Pretzels are exactly like what you get in Philadelphia. 
Because it was delivery and there is a $10 minimum I also ordered a small cheesesteak that I have not had yet because how much can a person eat at once?  I'm not a fan of Whiz so I opted for the make your own and got beef (no self respecting person with Philly roots really gets chicken) and I got provolone, which is always my preferred chesesteak cheese. Since I haven't had the sandwich yet I can't comment on the amount of meat but I will update this after I have had it. 
Also was excited to see they have the roast pork sandwich, another Philly food. 
I can't imagine eating this often bc of the calories but anytime I'm feeling like indulging and having some great comfort food I am for sure coming here. This will also be where I get pizza for now on!!!
Love this place!!!  If you have no Philly ties I think you can still enjoy this. Only problem is you may never be able to enjoy the food they serve elsewhere ;)"}
{"text":"Tasty Philly stake and nice staff. They also have pizza, wings stc. Good price good portions. I love the movie Rocky on the tv screens. I love Corleone's. They are located in front of Savers and next to Kodo sushi sake. I think they do delivery. 
It's going to be my favorite."}
{"text":"I can't complain about the food, the restaurant is clean, but I don't go there anymore cause I can't pay four dollars for one slice of pizza, there's lots of places around that I'll give you two slices for five bucks, so whoever is doing their pricing is scaring away customers,"}
{"text":"Every time is just as good if not better than the last. Thank god I don't live closer I would be here every day! On this visit the bread was extremely fresh and added to the overall awesomeness of Corleone's. Keep up the good work!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and ordered 2 slices of pepperoni pizza. The slices were good size and reasonably priced. The disappointing part was that they were very greasy. The grease soaked through the wax paper and then the cardboard box they were in. I used 7 napkins to soak up all the grease that was still left on the top of the slices. Once I got the grease soaked up the slices were good. Also good luck getting the red pepper flakes to come out of the shakers. I tried for like 30 seconds and got maybe 10 flakes."}
{"text":"Amazing Philly cheesesteaks done Philly style. If your in the mood for cheesesteaks this is the place."}
{"text":"Best Philly cheesesteak in the valley! I get the small beef, no onions, whiz on the side (so I can control quantity and less messy).  Not healthy but delicious."}
{"text":"Went here today by default, was looking for the Twisted Rose but it was closed.  I thought the food was decent - had the steak cheesesteak with fries.  Nothing that I would go out of my way for, but okay - the portion sizes are large."}
{"text":"I have been a fan of Corleone's in Phx for a long time.  However, the Scottsdale location does not have the same standards.  No fries, watered down tea, and dirty tables, I saw 4 staff members and no one was cleaning the dinning area.   
The bread on my sandwich and the pretzel were both hard.  Will not be coming back here again."}
{"text":"Overall a pretty good cheesesteak.  I like the cheese fries a lot as well.  It's not the healthiest of meals but every once in a while I enjoy indulging."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. I was looking for a good cheesesteak and this place mostly delivered. They also serve pizza, which was very good.

We gave both a try and the pizza was probably my favorite. The cheesteak was good but the meat was a little dry and under seasoned, it needed some salt. I would have given this place 4 stars but the cashier was on his cell phone while we were ordering at the register. It was a little annoying."}
{"text":"For a hot spicy treat, get a original with cheese wiz and make it a buffalo. I have been eating here for 5 years. Great atmosphere the food is outstanding every time and  Kelly will always greet you with a smile and fantastic service."}
{"text":"Great food and great people here that will bend over to make sure you're happy. The cheese steaks are about the best in Phx. Pizza is good and the fact that a Rocky movie is always on no matter when you go should show how authentic this place is. Worth trying and definitely worth returning."}
{"text":"Well, I have to say I am disappointed.

My roommate and I called our order in for takeout. We had a coupon for 24.99 2 large cheese pizzas and 24 wings which we thought was a pretty sweet deal. The back of the menu we had had all the toppings listed at .50 extra a piece so we said why not and added 2 to each pizza (meatball and ham to one, and chicken and bacon to the other). We also requested that both the pizza and the wings be extra crispy and come with some ranch.

Once we arrive, we are told that our new price was almost $35. What. How?

They explain (over the course of several minutes) how we added $8 dollars to our order by adding 4 toppings ($2?). I still didn't get it, but oh well. I was hungry and I didn't care, so we paid and left.

Once we got home though we realized that neither pizza was extra crispy, nor were the wings, and, on top of all that, we got no ranch. Lovely.

I like this place usually but dang, this experience sucked."}
{"text":"I don't ever  need to go to Pat's or Geno's in Philly.. I think the best cheese steak is at this joint in North Scottsdale.  I get mine with the wiz and it is finger licking good.  No soggy fries here either..they must double fry them b/c they are golden and crispy.  I've also had cheese pizza by the slice and would go back just for that too."}
{"text":"Seriously guys what happened?!? Being from Philly this was our only go to place that was as close to home pizza and cheese steaks but since you went to franchise the quality had gone downhill 100%! This was our third chance we gave you in the past 2 months and what we got served was a hot circle of uncooked garbage. Anyone that would actually prepare and think it was ok to serve a pound of cheese on a pizza knows nothing about pizza.  When you place a whole pound of cheese on top and burn the under crust it leaves the middle an uncooked greasy soft mess that is inedible.   I think everyone that works there should make a pizza that way and actually try to eat it.  When you pick the slice up the cheese slides off in a coagulated ball of cheese and grease and your left with an uncooked crust.  Very disappointed it is a shame because you had a good thing with us east coasters that miss home. I truly wish I could upload the picture I took of the hot mess we had to throw in the garbage :("}
{"text":"Damn... so good. We ordered a large pepperoni pizza, cheese fries, and some wings. All of it was seriously delish. This is the first time i ordered from them,and loved that I could do it I've yelp. So great! All of it! I'm ordering again :) thank you"}
{"text":"I hear there are other items on the menu besides the Philly Cheesesteak & the chick cheesesteak.  I'd never know...  I love this place!  These are the best Philly Cheesesteaks outside of Philly.  Good bread and authentic toppings.  The people inside are fun and good service.  This is one of my favorite places for lunch."}
{"text":"I'm from NJ and this pizza is top notch NY style.  Would recommend to anyone.  I wish I lived closer to Scottsdale (I'm in SW valley), I would be here all the time!"}
{"text":"This place is the best. The closest thing to a true Philly Cheese Steak that isn't in Philly."}
{"text":"Super busy at lunch but worth the wait. Best Cheesesteak sandwich you're gonna find in Arizona without a doubt."}
{"text":"I'm honestly not a fan of cheesesteaks, BUT I love this place for lunch. It is one of very few places that I order from on a regular basis. 

The Food: I get the chicken cheesesteak with buffalo sauce and it is VERY good. It would be a tad on the dry side without the sauce but the buffalo sauce is so good. It's a perfect compliment to the sandwich. The fries are very good with their cheese sauce and they give you a large portion. I usually split my sandwich and have half the fries and the other half of the sandwich for lunch the next day. 

The Convenience: Not only do they not charge a delivery fee they also have one of the lowest minimum delivery prices in the area. On days when I am swamped at work or when I just can't get the time to get out I order from here. The delivery has always been great. My food comes hot and usually before their quoted delivery time."}
{"text":"Was running around like crazy and was starving so we decided to stop by.  Their steak and cheese was excellent."}
{"text":"Yummy, yummy in my tummy!!
Got the original cheese steak with american (I know, how dare I?!) and added lettuce and tomato.  Oh my gosh - delish!  The steak is cooked perfectly, and the bread - it makes the sandwich.  It's perfect.  In fact writing this review, I'm craving another one.  This will be another one of my must haves while in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Watched a cockroach walk from the kitchen to the soda fountain. When I notified one of the employees he proceeded to step on it, pick it up with a napkin and go back to preparing food.  No washing his hands. No mopping up where the bug was crushed. 

Never going back."}
{"text":"Good lunch place that is always busy. If you have been to Philly, Corleone's is not bad in comparison. I like their Italian Hoagie, but the cheesesteak is pretty good too. The bread is what makes a great sandwich in Philadelphia and they have those amorosa rolls here too. For those Philly transplants, they have tastycakes for dessert."}
{"text":"We moved here from the Philadelphia area two months ago and were craving steak sandwiches and hoagies.  We heard lots of great things about Corleones so we gave it a try.  For someone that spent most of their life in Philadelphia I have this to say:
1)  The bread is wrong.  Consistency is not the same and the bread to meat ratio is too high.
2)  The steak sandwich was not greasy enough.  This is good if you do not like grease but then it is not authentic.
3)  Hoagie suffered from the same bread issue.  The bread to meat ratio was too high.  Seasonings and meat on the hoagie were correct.

Service and staff were great.  If this is the best the area has to offer than we will try Corleones again."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great price! The kind of place that I can see myself going when I'm drunk or sober and having an equally fun time."}
{"text":"I'm shocked at so many low ratings here.  Was I just hungry?

Well, I went back a 2nd time.  Nope...with the Whiz and the onions, I really, really love these sandwiches.

OK...I know I'm supposed to be on a diet now but what the heck.......sigh...they're good...fattening as hell.....but damned good."}
{"text":"HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED! I've ordered from them before and it was pretty good, but their new staff is HORRIBLE! I called to make an order and they put me on hold and hung up. I called two more times to still place my order and they continuously picked up and hung up in me. I know they close at 8, but my order was called in at 7:15. I pray that the owner wises up and fires some of his LAZY employees. I will NEVER go back/call back because of this experience."}
{"text":"I am from the Philly area and these are the closest to home I can find.  The bread is chewy (like it's supposed to be) the steak is real rib eye and the service is always fast with a smile.  Fries are always top notch and it's great to have huge ketchup pumps.  some places like to tell you how you should eat your food. For example Subway, Jimmy Johns DON'T OFFER KETCHUP.  they have some nerve to tell you how to eat your food. Trust me beef and ketchup do go together!

The pizza, WOW.  they use GRANDE CHEESE.  in case you're not familiar with that cheese, it's super expensive and the best of the best.  the late great Pizza Connection on Indian and 44th st used to use it.  it makes for an amazing non greasy cheese for pizza.

look for coupons in the mail and the receipts offer discounts on your next visit too so it's a little cheaper than the menu might suggest."}
{"text":"that's NOT a cheese steak. drive a bit further to Rinaldi's for the real thing.

--\"roll\" is partially-cooked machine-made batch of chemicals
--so greasy I had to wipe the table afterward, and I never even took it out of the wrapper; the grease soaked through the foil wrapper (how is that possible)
--mushrooms surely from a can
--onions from I'm-afraid-to-think-about-where-they-might-be-from

I'm certainly one to stick to family tradition (placing my finger against my nostril as I say it), but this one belongs in the gutter.

NO."}
{"text":"I order delivery all the time from here , I love the phillys! I always add jalapeños and peppers and onion on mine along with Provolone cheese and it's so good !! Mmm at least twice a week I order from here . It's so good !"}
{"text":"Holy WOW, Batman.
Stopped in for dinner on a Saturday night we both got The Original with the Whiz.... Is there any other way?
Yum yum yummy yum yum!

It wasn't busy (perhaps they are during the week). Our dinner was quick. Staff was friendly. Place was clean and bright.

What more is there to say? If you like a good Philly Cheesesteak, this is your place."}
{"text":"I had the original steak with wiz. Delicious and generous with the meat, bread has just the right amount of chewiness to it."}
{"text":"Love, love this place.. Basically a cheese steak man wit.. Great fries and banana peppers. Always consistent.. That is 90% of the battle.. In my rotation.."}
{"text":"Never been here before decided to try it out since I was on the property working. The fries were pretty good move and crunchy. I ordered the original with provolone and mushrooms and peppers... It was good... Not something I'd drive out of my way for but if I was in the area I would go back. My order was to go but the restaurant itself was clean and staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Very good steak and cheese sandwiches, especially if toasted. 

However, the place is always dirty. And it needs a remodeling.

A good indication of how good a restaurant is by how clean its bathrooms are. The bathrooms here are as dirty as the kitchen. 

Even the grill for the steak and cheese seems to only been cleaned once a day. 

Where I'm from, Boston, every sub shop I go to cleans the griddle after every steak and cheese is cooked. 

The one here is caked in grease and remnants of steak. 

Gross."}
{"text":"Corleone's was decent. I shared a regular size Philly cheese steak wit' whiz and grilled onions, and had a bite of pepperoni pizza. The sandwich was made fairly quickly and was well seasoned. It was, however, very watery and runny which affected the consistency of the Cheez Whiz. The juices from the meat and the Whiz dripped down like a monsoon downpour as I ate the sandwich. The bread was soft but slightly cold as I bit into it. Fries were decent and crispy.

The pizza was thin crust, with a slight crispiness to the crust. It was also decent.

For me it was alright. It's not really a place I would really go out of my way to visit, but I might stop by here to eat if I'm already in this shopping plaza."}
{"text":"Seriously the best philly cheesesteak sandwich I've ever had.  The restaurant is decorated really nice & the staff is the best.  They add cheese wiz to the sandwiches & it makes it sooo good! Love it that it's in the Saver's parking lot."}
{"text":"I ordered a cheese steak with wiz, onions, and peppers. The add-ons costed me .75 each, even though the sign said .25. With a drink and fries, it came out to 11.50, which is on the higher end of reasonable. 
It turns out the added toppings were worth it. The peppers were juicy and crunchy, and the mushrooms were fresh. The steak itself was pretty standard fare, and I got exactly what I expected with the wiz. If you want to taste primarily cheese though, you should get extra wiz. 
The fries we well done (which I liked) and very salty (which I didn't).
The meal was 4 star, with the deduction coming from the mislabeled price"}
{"text":"Some of my coworkers ordered in and I decided to try something since I'd never had Corleone's before. I was under the wire to place an order so I had the Godfather sandwich with some fries. After everyone had gotten their hoagies I felt a little disappointed with my sandwich but still had some hope. My sandwich was just okay. There wasn't anything extra hot about the peppers or really extraordinary about the sandwich in general. The fries were good. I'll have to try a hoagie sometime to really nail down an opinion."}
{"text":"Our first time experience ordering delivery from Corleones and let me tell ya, we will be repeat customers in the near future. Great food and service at an affordable price. Thanks."}
{"text":"I came here Saturday after spending the day at the Arabian Horse show with a friend, and we grabbed a bite to eat at Corleones.  I've been here several times before, but not in some time. 

I really do love thier subs, and think they put out a great product.  Prices are a little steep, but not unaffordable.  They have a great selection of subs, all made Philly style with cheese whiz and all.  I went with the small #3, and it was delicious! My friend got the same thing, but with fries, and our bill came out to be just under $20 for both of us....2 drinks, 1 order of fries and 2 small subs.

Despite having great food, sometimes the service here is bland, borderline bad.   I think it really depends on whos working the register.  This time, it was a really young kid, and he didnt seem to really give 2 cents about customer service.  

Ive had other poor experiences here with their service behind the counter and found it annoying.  One time I went in 5 minutes before closing on a Saturday night, hoping to grab a sub before they closed.  I not only got dirty looks from the guys cleaning the grill behind the counter, but a rude \"WE'RE CLOSED\" scream from some dude in the dining area cleaning tables.  They were obviously in a rush to get out of there, and did not hesitate closing a few minutes early on me.  Yea, fun times.

For the food itself, this place is good....service, don't expect much in regards to pleasantries or nicey nicey attitudes."}
{"text":"I recommend Corleones for authentic Philly Cheesesteaks. The roll is very important for a good cheesesteak and Corleones has a great roll. The meat is chopped not a thin slice of meat like some places. The pictures on the wall, Tastykakes and soft pretzels remind me of home.  Now if they open a Wawa on Hayden rd, I 'll be heaven."}
{"text":"The food at this location is wonderful, however it is of much lesser quality at their other AZ locations. Also, the service is some of the worst I've had in a while. We frequent this location because of the food, but every time we do eat here we are treated poorly and the staff is very rude to us. 

The other thing that I can't seem to figure out is how they can charge for extra dipping sauce for the wings, but only fill them a quarter to half way full. If I'm paying for extra dipping sauce, I want my money's worth. 

Basically, if you're willing to put up with lackluster staff to get some good pizza and wings, this place is it!"}
{"text":"If you like traditional Philly Cheesesteaks, Corleones will do you just fine.  For less than $9 you get a large sandwich filled with tasty chopped steak, grilled onions, and your choice of cheese.  The fries are also crispy and, at least during busy hours, hot and fresh.  

Do you feel like a cheesesteak (or the chicken variety)?  Is order-at-the-counter, basic decor, and serve your own soft drinks just fine?  If so, head on over.  If you want anything else, forget about it."}
{"text":"Has a great Philly cheese!!!  But service is hit or miss. You never know what kind of service you will get. Most of the time it's not the best. I call my order in or use the app grub hub and half the time I come in 10 mins later and they haven't even started it and it's not even busy!"}
{"text":"Soo good. Definitely recommend if you want an East Coast \"cheesesteak\". About to order from this place again. Love love love it!!"}
{"text":"Nearest thing I've found to NYstyle pizza! Many places claim they make NY style pizza here in the valley but I've been disappointed over and over. They get it pretty close here, thin foldable slice with a thick edge, olive oil under the sauce. Perfect!!"}
{"text":"This place is supposed to sell slice of pizza they have been open for 35 min.no pizza yet I will have go somewhere else my son won't eat a chease steak sucks that now I have to go somewhere else the help here is on there phone and act like they don't care will not be back not to mention my sandwich is all bread and very little steak"}
{"text":"Great team! Love this place.  I have come in right before close (I know! Bad!) and they are always smiles and happy to help me.  This location has the best staff if you ask me.  Love their food always but the staff is why I come back!"}
{"text":"Yooo I just ate the other half of my chicken philly from Saturday.. Omgg it was so bomb..... LOVE YOU GUYS KEEP UP THE GREAT FOOD.. If you havent been to this established walk into the street stop put your foot out and let it get ran over.. Cause thats what everyday is going to be like until you have food from there.."}
{"text":"I'm from Southern Utah but I was in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area and tried Corleones and was really impressed. I really like the size, amount of meat, price, and taste of the philly cheese steak sandwich. I now really hope that someone brings a franchise to St George, Utah. I ate at this place twice within the weekend I was in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"The valley is a great place to live. The weather, the mountains, golf, hiking, lots of great people. 

Oh, the restaurants. Many of them leave a lot to be desired, especially the \"back east transplants\".  While I must say I've found some great places to eat, Corleone's isn't one of them. I've been to Philly, I've had a true Philly Sandwich and this isn't it. My partner and I both ordered #1 with fries and a drink. 

The sandwich came with very little meat and lots of bun. To make it worse it was very greasy. The fries were just like the sandwich, greasy and in this case overcooked.

I'm going to have to look further for a true Philly Cheesesteak, Chicago hot dog and Chicago Deep-dish Pizza.

If anyone has suggestions, I'm open to try them."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Corleone's. I'm a big, big fan of cheesesteaks with wiz.

For me Corleone's, though a bit pricey, does the trick. Love the standard cheesesteak, typically go extra wiz. Good bread, ample meat, love the wiz. Can't beat the wiz. Great fries too. I'd eat it all time if the metabolism could afford it.

I know there's a holy war with regard to wiz vs. provolone but I saw an episode of Taste (by David Rosengarten) many years back where he supported the fact that wiz is a viable option for an authentic cheesesteak. Since that time, I have of course tried it (many times) and have been a fan since my first one. So you can rant & rave at me about provolone & authenticity but I'm sticking with my wiz.

While I'm always on the lookout for good cheesesteaks, Corleone's does the trick whenever I'm there."}
{"text":"Love this place! The cheesesteak is one of the best I've had in the valley and the pizza is pretty damn good too. This place is one of my regular stops for take out on Sundays before football games. It's a little on the pricey side for a full sandwich but you definitely get your money's worth and you won't be hungry when you're done. Get the cheese wiz for an extra $0.75!  Fries are thin and crispy just like they should be and go great with the wiz. Sign up for email coupons and they will send you nice deals about once a week. You can also bring in old receipts for $2 off your next visit. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"The worst sandwich ever.  Bought a regular cheese steak and was very disappointed with the amount of bread compared to the meat.  Eat somewhere else if you want a good sandwich."}
{"text":"Kelly is the best! Amazing staff! They were so friendly and helped me carry my Togo order to the car! I love the fries and the Philly cheese steak! Make sure to tell them heavy on Wizzz! You'll thank me later! Free delivery is a plus! Make sure to put your number into the system they do weekly coupons and specials! I keep hearing good things about the Bbq chicken pizza that will be my next order! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"W5nt there around 330pm friday. So, place wasn't busy yet.  Clean basic italian pizza joint with reds as the primary color schemes....it was nice.
Service was quick and adequate.
Ordered standard cheese wit combo...cheeae wiz and sauteed onions with fries.  The sandwich was good  plenty of beef the fries were just okay because these were lightly flowered/battered fries and isn't really my thing, but for to go they do hold thier crispness better. The standard is foot long and pretty big. In fact i only ate half and will have something to look forward to this eve.
Yep, I'd go back, but probably not running."}
{"text":"I've been to this Corleone's two or three times now and I'm done with it. The food tastes ok, but if you're a diehard Philly fan, it probably won't be. On a typical $10 order, it seems overpriced by about $2-3. And even worse, it doesn't fill you up! But where it totally fails is the food pickup process.

This last time, I went in on a busy Friday lunch hour and it was packed. And here's where it got annoying. All of the customers were crowded near the takeout counter while the staff was serving orders on the other side. I noticed that people also stood in front of the soda machines which is probably the WORST place one could be at. It's basically a huge mess of a dozen people in this tiny area waiting for their food. To make matters worse, the staff announces the order numbers without a mic. It gets so loud inside you can barely hear the numbers. An announcer mic playing through the overhead speakers would help immensely. Or just give everyone a number card to put at their table and have a server on-hand to deliver the food, similar to what Culver's does in their drive-through.

I tried the pizza for the first time, and wow, it was terrible. Why is it so hard for Phoenix shops to make a pizza with flavor? I was slinging better stuff when I was in high school working for a convenience store. I got an ounce of orange grease with two slices of cheese. It was crazy, and two napkins couldn't contain this BP gusher on my plate. My coworker had the cheese steak and told me later that he blew up the bathroom an hour after."}
{"text":"This place is great. Total guilty pleasure food. The sandwiches are amazing and the fries are some of the best I've had. I love coming here but I got to keep it limited because that has to be the worst possible food to eat regularly, and it's also pretty pricey, right around $13."}
{"text":"Definitely our favorite Philly cheesesteak place in the valley! Wish the Mill Ave location didn't close :("}
{"text":"Good little Philly cheese steak and pizza place in the neighborhood. It is a franchise but they do a good job. Plus lots of good deals through their email club. Worth checking out."}
{"text":"So, I've given this place another couple of chances since updating my review. The bad Bing chicken sandwich is really good, so I keep coming back. I have been pleased the last few times I've ordered food from here and I'm happy that I get to update my review!"}
{"text":"I am not one to complain, and have worked plenty of service jobs, but it took 1 hour and 45 minutes to get our delivery. When I originally called it in they said 45 mins to an hour. So I waited 1 hr PLUS 10 mins before calling to make sure we weren't forgotten. We were told the driver was \"just around the corner\", but finally got it 35 minutes later. Why even advertise delivery? This is not the first time this has happened. All the people in the Valley that need jobs, and they don't have but one driver?? Unbelievable. Out of all the deliveries we've had this place is the worst. The food was great (hence the 4 stars), but this is the last time we are going to order delivery from them."}
{"text":"1st time at this location during lunch hour food took 15 to 20 minutes. Steak Philly was very dry. Dirty inside. Been to a couple other locations and never been disappointed until now. Won't be back to this location."}
{"text":"I have a love/hate affair with this establishment. I've decided that although there are some aspects I am not fond of, the food is good enough to bypass all of that.

If you place a phone order, you'll most likely get put on a hold. Also, sometimes the food takes a bit too long to come out. If you get delivery, sometimes they take way longer than they should, sometimes it's quick. In addition, the staff for the most part are... not rude but not overly friendly either.
