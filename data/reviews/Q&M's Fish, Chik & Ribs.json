{"text":"Great barbecue! Tried the 1/2 chicken and pulled pork sandwich. Very good and great portions. Looking forward to trying the ribs. Corn bread was great! Very fast service."}
{"text":"Ate at Q & M for the first time today. It definitely won't be the last! The food was absolutely delicious. They should market that BBQ sauce! As good as the food was, the family who cooked and served our meal was even sweeter! Thanks for a great meal at was is sure to become a new favorite restaurant for us."}
{"text":"Food is incredible! Have tried most of the menu and nothing disappoints. Support this small business!"}
{"text":"I took two bites of the Big Q Carolina Platter and threw it in the garbage. Very dissapointed."}
{"text":"Large portions, great price, excellent homemade food! Just be sure to get there early for the Friday dinner rush so you get to try the mac n cheese before they run out."}
{"text":"Great barbecue in Plum? Heck yeah!  On my first visit I went with the 12 wingettes dinner with mac & cheese, greens and baked beans as my sides to go. The chicken was fried to perfection. Nice and crispy skin on the outside and hot and juicy meat on the inside. The mac & cheese was pretty incredible too. The greens were tasty as well but, the baked beans were just ok.  On my second visit I brought my daughter along with me. This time we tried their ribs, corn on the cob, more of that incredible mac & cheese, potato salad, cucumber salad and corn bread.   The ribs were very meaty and tender. I just didn't really care for the barbecue sauce. It was really  sweet and I like a more mustard based sauce. I didn't like the cucumber salad but, it was given to me complementary so I can't really complain too much. The potato salad was just okay. My wife makes the best potato salad in the world so hers is pretty had to beat. The mac & cheese is still great though and the corn bread was very good also.  One thing about Q&M's is that they give you A LOT of food for the money. I don't think that it's possible to leave there hungry. When you go ask for Linda or Terry, the owners and tell them I sent you. They will take care of you.    Also, be sure to download the Q&M App for Apple and Android to get coupons and specials."}
{"text":"Really good BBQ ribs, beans, and Cole slaw.  Ribs are St. Louis style and very meaty!! Mac n Cheese is very cheesy but needs salt.  Nevertheless we would definitely order from here again!"}
{"text":"Tried it out on my way home one afternoon. The smell inside the place makes you want to order the whole menu. I ordered the BQ beef brisket dinner with mac and cheese and smoked corn on the cob. My dad ordered the pulled pork dinner with cornbread and coleslaw and we also ordered a baked potato. First of all, portions were amazing. We're both big eaters and still had leftovers for lunch the next day. Brisket had good flavor plain but the sauce took it over the top to being a great meal. Mac and cheese was best ive ever had and the corn was a smoky unique flavor that was a satisfying compliment to the rest of the meal. Cornbread was so perfectly buttery and the baked potato was nearly a meal by itself. My dad was impressed with his pulled pork, slaw, and cornbread. All around great food for a respectable price for bbq. The employees and owner are friendly. 'Uncle' sat and talked sports with us while we waited for food. Awesome experience"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE!! The portions are HUGE, the price is amazing, and the staff is so friendly! We tried to visit several times but they close very early and sometimes close earlier than their posted hours, so I would recommend calling before you visit but it is worth it! The BBQ sauce is so incredibly delicious that I dipped everything in it! Everything is made in house and to order. The ribs weren't fall off the bone tender, but they were still so good! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"So I've been passing this place for a while since I live in the area and finally stopped!  Let me tell you I was not disappointed and the aroma coming from this building is intoxicating. I walked into a quaint little place with some cool pig themed decor. I walked to the counter and looked over the menu. They had the normal BBQ fare with some interesting stuff I've never seen too.  I couldn't resist getting my favorite things to see how they stacked up to my taste. I got a rack of ribs, collard greens, Mac & Cheese, and corn bread. Now the ribs were super tasty had a nice smoky flavor and hey come in a nice light BBQ sauce. U usually don't like my ribs sauced but these were once exception which proved me wrong. The sides were yummy but nothing popped out for me to rave about. Everything was tasty and the mac had a great amount of cheese on it. The collard green were ever so slightly under cooked for my liking but they still had great flavor.  I will be going back to try some other things out in the furrier"}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times, never was there  an issue withh anything.  You get so much for your dollar. The flavors are always on point. Desserts delicious and the  staff is friendly and respectable. I highly recommend this spot  m. Try the loaded potato and the cheese fries."}
{"text":"We just moved nearby Q&M, and decided to give it a try, we were so happy we did! We have been back several times already! The BBQ was fantastic! The brisket and pulled pork sandwiches were the best I've had. They give you huge portions too! The mac n Cheese is great and so are the other sides- I have tried the cucumber salad, sweet potato casserole, fries, potato salad- they are all wonderful. I think the dish that really stood out to me was the Chicken and Waffles. It's something I've always wanted to try, and I'm glad I did. The fried chicken was crispy and delicious. The waffles were thick and fluffy, and all of it was topped with syrup. There was enough on my plate to feed a whole family! They have homemade sweet tea and lemonade. The prices are very reasonable. They also offer catering. The staff is very super friendly and I love the soul music they play in the dining room. It's not a huge place, but it's a great one! I'm glad Q&M is in my neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Don't drive by Q&M's just because it is located in a strip mall.  This is exactly what Carolina Comfort is.  Smoked meats, with real smoke not liquid smoke, in every form.  A sauce that could please the pickiest of BBQer's.  A generous portion of anything you order.  Farmstand fresh vegetables.  You know exactly where this food comes from, local.  The Big Q's Platter can easily feed two.  And is still a less expensive than a meal for one."}
{"text":"Well. They close at 7pm but don't walk in there at 5:30pm and try to eat in. They gave us the boot. Lost my business. Too bad, food is good."}
{"text":"My family has been to Q&M's several times and will be coming back.  The people are friendly and the food is excellent.  The pulled pork is my favorite.  I don't think I've had better.  Brisket is good, as are the ribs.  We've had the following side dishes:  Mac and cheese, coleslaw, sweet potato casserole and corn bread.  Give the sweet potato casserole a try.  It is loaded with nutmeg and sweetness.  Delicious!  The corn bread is some of the best I've had as well.  In fact, we sometimes go there just for the cornbread.  My only complaint:  on several occasions the ribs have had a slight taste of lighter fluid."}
