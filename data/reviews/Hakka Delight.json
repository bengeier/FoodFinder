{"text":"I took my family out for Dinner! The food was great! The service was prompt. Overall it's a recommended Resturant, specially if you are looking for Indian Chinise fusion.   -- Parveen T."}
{"text":"Awful food ..bad experience.. veg pakora were burnt and  not cooked... then the manager did not want to credit..."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I have been there for 5 weekends continuously! Veg manchow soup is a must try. I am a vegetarian so have tried only Veg options from their menu. I am a great fan of Indian roadside food (Manchurian and noodles) and this is the closest in taste I have found in Toronto. Go on weekend night, they are hardly crowded.  I am giving 4 for the reason that taste is not consistent, they are very good all the 5 time5, but excellent only 3 times out of 5!  Mind you, quantities of most of the dish are large and I like it :)"}
{"text":"What used to be Chor Bazaar in Brampton is now Brampton Dragon (under new management). Great place for affordable yet really good quality Hakka style Chinese food (Indian style Chinese food)  FOOD: - LOT of options - great variety of appetizers, main dishes, noodles, fried rice etc.  - had the chicken pakoras, chilli chicken and hot spicy garlic fish for appetizers == loved all of them, but chicken pakoras were my absolute favourite - chicken noodles and chicken fried rice were really good too.. - flavourful, spice can be regulated to the customer - huge plus point - was not greasy. (usually, I can't finish just one order of noodles and chilli chicken due to the grease).. this food was very light yet tasty.  Food rating: 5/5 for the price  PRICE: - dishes were priced around 8-9 bucks - appetizers were around 9-10 bucks - lot of quantity - For the five dishes which easily fed 5 people - paid 90 bucks including the tip Price rating: 5/5 for food quality  DECOR: - good comfortable seating, spacious - clean - light music Decor rating: 4/5  SERVICE: - fairly fast service - polite, friendly, helpful, willing to recommend properly Service rating: 5/5  OVERALL RATING: 5/5   Why to go there:  - Cheap but really good quality hakka style chinese food - not greasy / super-salty - comfortable seating - which is not to be taken for granted for a lot of other hakka style chinese places - spacious enough to accommodate larger groups too - great service  Why not to go there: - maybe not the first date... but i can't see why not for a second date (unless she's the stereotypical \"jersey shore\"-type chick =P)!"}
{"text":"Amazing place. The food is great and the service is wonderful. There's always lits of parking, which is good. Its always clean and the food portions are greatly sized and at a decent price too. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Amazing food !! The food was fresh and so full of taste.. They had numerous varieties of dishes for noodles and rices.. There veggie and chicken dry manchurian was tasty.. The service was absolutely great. They where attentive to all of the details and continually where asking how everything was.. Loved it.."}
{"text":"Randomly came across this whole visiting Brampton for a wedding through yelp. The outside sign is misleading, inside is nice and spacious. Even better was the food. We ordered a combo order of manchurian gobi, chili chicken, spring rolls, noodles, and they were all delicious. The hot and sour chicken soup was also good, but not as spicy as I wanted it to be. It wasn't super busy so we got our food in a good time, everything was hot. Also, the food was not oily which is usually surprising for a Indo-Chinese fusion place. Overall very satisfied with our random chance visit to this place and if I lived here I would definitely eat there and/or order take out again. Pricing is extremely reasonable for a group of 6 as well."}
{"text":"As someone who has eaten at many Hakka Restaurants in the GTA, this is one of the best!   You get what you pay for and what you get is perfectly prepared non greasy Hakka!   If you like spicy, you'll love this place!"}
{"text":"We go here all the time the food is great and the service is even better. Owner/Cook always greets us and remembers our faces very kind and has alot of patience.    They did hire an ass of a waiter at one point but he's no longer there. thankfully! Food is great chicken pakoras are so so good.    Try it out!"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at this restaurant, food was okay. Staff is extra friendly and courteous. Overall it is a nice place."}
{"text":"Was in the area and saw a Hakka Chinese Restaurant that looked interesting.  Went in and It was their first day.  They had a huge menu of Lunch Specials for $7.99, I can't believe the number of choices they had.  I got their recommended Chilli Chicken and my friend got the Sweet and Sour Chicken.  It was plenty of food for that price that included pop, spring roll, soup, steamed rice and what looks like a smaller version of the entree dish.  I'm a huge fan of Hakka food and I must say the food was quite fresh, the staff was friendly and well, since it's new, it was pretty clean.  I would definitely go back again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"If you are looking for Indian roadside chinese then Go for it.Very fast service and large quantity.We ordered veg hakka noodles,Veg Manchurian and veg fried rice.Everything is very tasty."}
{"text":"Great food, definitely ask for the dry Hakka chilli chicken special. The corn soup is fantastic and the portions are big for the cost."}
{"text":"I've ordered a few times from hakka delight. I've tried their chili chicken lunch special, great portion size and decent chili chicken. I substituted the steamed rice for the egg fried rice however it's pretty oily, too oily for my liking. It's not the best hakka I've had but decent for the price."}
{"text":"Chicken wonton soup is absolutely amazing. Get the large for plenty of leftovers for the coming week."}
{"text":"We came here on a Thursday night. It's supposed to close in half an hour but they let us in anyway. Food was delivered to us very quickly after ordering. We had Manchurian chicken and chicken pokoras. Chicken pokoras are now one of my favorite Hakka dishes. Manchurian chicken was great too! A bit spicier than I thought it would be."}
{"text":"A good place for those who don't like bland Chinese food ! Here comes the hot and spicy version of Chinese food and it's called Indo Chinese fusion !  This place is a great place if you like spices of india in Chinese noodles !! Or vegetable dumplings in hot garlic sauce !!"}
{"text":"We are from San Jose California visiting here for a wedding. We were craving Indian Chinese food and found this place on Yelp. We ordered Chinese Hakka noodles, Spicy Garlic Chicken, hot and sour chicken, vegetable Manchurian balls and Jasmine tea. The food was great, the tea hot and the service was friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"The place is under new management I think. The food is good but nothing to rave about either. If you are looking for a quick bite during lunch, this is a safe choice. Food is served really fast which is great if you are pressed for time.  The new ambience is quite ok. There had always been only one server when we go during lunch. However, it has never been crowded.  The portions fills you up just right. There were times that we have taken the lunch special left overs back.  The price is great. For one person, it would cost the same as it would for a combo meal at McDonalds."}
{"text":"So this the second place I've tried Indian Chinese after guddus chili chicken.   This is way better than guddus, I got fried rice, noodles, Manchurian veg and chicken spring rolls.   Food was good, the problem is I'm from BC and I compare every Indian Chinese place to chilli pepper house, which is the Mecca of Indian Chinese food. Nothing else comes close.   So that's why I'll give this 3 starts, kinda on the pricier side but the good was not bad. Definitely will try again."}
{"text":"Tip and NOT a review.  So I went there on a quiet Sunday evening and it was empty.So the service was top notch but the food lacks flavor I wouldn't call it authentic Hakka style food at all.Wasn't too happy with the food therefore won't be going back."}
{"text":"Many many years ago a group of Chinese spice traders took forth a journey on the spice trail to gather spices and ended up in India. The hakka region was warm and inviting with beautiful women and an enjoyable climate.  They chose to not return to their homeland and take roots in a new country.  The result is chinese food infused with Indian spices and they call it Hakka  Lunch specials are $8 and include soup or pop and a spring roll with rice  The traditional dish is manchurian chicken and that works for me. It's chicken stir fried in a rich, dark, complex sauce infused with a mix of spices.  It's delicious and the chef has a nice hand in clever plating with a touch of coriander here and turmeric there.  Enjoy two world cuisines in one sitting and for less than a frozen patty burger and fries ...eat healthy!"}
{"text":"Was there yesterday to order  Hot garlic chicken w/ rice  Salt and spicy calamari  Vegetable spring rolls  Dry manchurian shrimp w/ noodles   The calamari was a brick to eat. Not tender at all it was like biting into dehydrated food   The shrimp was a max of maybe 10 medium sized shrimp- piled on pepper and onion to make up the volume of the meal   The noodle for an extra 2.25 and the rice were portion controlled for children.   Only pro: the chicken. That was edible enough.   Total tab:41$ aka money not well spent after going with Yelp's reviews"}
{"text":"We got some takeout rice, special chow mein, chili chicken, and beef with broccoli.  It was the best Hakka food we've ever had in our lives. They were very nice over the phone and in person and the food was ready quickly. It was very delicious. It is also in a convenient location in Brampton so that makes it even better. Oh, I almost forgot. The prices are very affordable and they give big portions so you definitely get your money's worth.  Love this place and cannot wait to go back next time we're craving Hakka food !"}
{"text":"Love this place so much we go about once a month.  The service and food is good, lots of parking, and we go during the slow time of the day around 4 PM which works great for us."}
{"text":"The price and service here, cannot be beat. Our server was excellent, she anticipated our every need and was so friendly and efficient.  She brought us extra plates to share and to go containers without us asking. They have lunch specials which were extremely reasonable.  I tried the curry fish, spicy beans, spicy soup, I ordered the chicken and my sister ordered beef. The portion sizes were good. We had left overs and were stuffed... and the three of us eat a lot. The food was tasty. I liked the chicken the best. The food wasn't as amazing as hakka that I've had in Markham  (le sigh). But it was good and I'd recommend it."}
{"text":"Few times our chicken was half cooked and last time I went, the chicken had no taste.  It's like they dont season it. I wont be retuning.   Great service.  Great portions at lunch at a good price.  Includes a soup.   Clean restaurant.   *Halal."}
{"text":"Came for lunch. Clean, friendly and fast service. Got the chicken hakka lunch special. Great hybridization of Chinese and Indian cuisines. Nicely fried noodles in a spicy garlicky Indian style sauce w/ tandoori chicken. fresh veggies and pleasing flavours. Came with a quality spring roll and real tasty hot n sour soup.     HYFR"}
{"text":"Really fast service efficient service. Food comes out hot and fast. Good food as well."}
{"text":"4 1/2 stars..... We popped in on our way to the Via Rail station....we went on Yelp and this was close to where we were. First impressions were off the mark...decor is non existent...but you're not there to eat the decor...so if the food is good, it makes up for it. Anyways...we arrived on a Sunday night at around 5:00 pm and the place was fairly empty...maybe because it was Sunday and Pride, or we were early for the dinner crowd. Regardless, we had the place virtually to ourself. We ordered: Chicken Pahkoras - they were tasty...but the home made sauce took them them to another level. I highly recommend the sauce...its spicy, full of flavour. We asked the waiter about it and he just laughed and said its a \"house secret\" they should seriously consider bottling and selling it.  Shanghai Noodles (chicken). I found them on the dry side, but my dining companions loved them. Strong curry flavour....other than the dryness they were great, Crispy Ginger Beef - excellent. Flavourful, crispy....a wonderful dish. Chili Chicken (house special), white meat ($3 extra) Spicy - Fantastic dish. The chicken was coated with seasoning and were served dry....it was an amazing dish...loads of flavour, succulent white meat cooked perfectly....one of the best Chili Chickens I've ever had. Service was attentive. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Try the HD Paneer as an appetizer. It has a delicious spicy, tangy taste. I suspect tamarind. They have the Hakka basics, chilli and Manchurian chicken and other classics. A unique drink to try is the lemon pop, freshly house-made with opt. pepper and possibly black salt (same seasoning on the pakora [which are also delicious]). This place is a true marriage of Indian and Chinese cuisine. Taking the best of both worlds, ie., the smokily delicious/mysterious flavours of wok-cooked cuisine and Indian spices. I look forward to trying the Hakka noodles soon. The place itself is basic and pragmatic, but I'm not looking anywhere else except my plate and my wife's face when I eat here... the service is fast and friendly, but I keep getting asked if my food is ok, once is enough, it's not like it will change mid-bite, hopefully. Though the leftovers seem to get better... Keep it up guys!"}
