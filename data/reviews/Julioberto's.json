{"text":"Never been inside. Always a drive through experience. The place could use retouching of paint, etc. By place I mean what little I can see from the drive thru window ;)

Food? 4.  Super tasty. Picky eater son loves their chicken tacos.  Try the patron burrito. I have half for breakfast and half for linner (lunch/dinner). It's THAT big."}
{"text":"OThis was the worst costumer service i have ever recieved!! The lady was very rude and disrespectful. It was around 1:30 am and i was very polite when placing my order and instantly i smelled something wrong. So i pulled around to get my order i gave the rude lady my money and the change she basically threw back at me. On the way home i was thinking do i even want to attempt to eat what i had just bought. Gave it 1 min and quickly pulled into the dark and desposed of the food. But i will say i did go there nights prior and the lady wasnt present. The lady before was respectful and very pleasant so i gave her extra money for a tip. The date was Sunday October 9th. As long as she is employed there i will not come back and neither will anyone i know or meet!!"}
{"text":"rolled tacos and bean burrito for xmas breakfast.
free wifi, cold water.
not busy
should be, very few places open today.
worth a try"}
{"text":"I love their Fish Burrito! They stuff that thing with fish and pico de gallo like it's going out of style. The more pico the better, I always say. Be sure to ALWAYS ask them for limes if you are getting the fish burrito. Their pollo asado is also amazing and sometimes it is OVERLY stuffed with guacamole. But again, that's always a good thing."}
{"text":"If you use drive through unwrap and check your order before you leave.  They just leave items out of the bag, and when you get home part of your order is missing.  After years of regular visits I'm never going back."}
{"text":"I was Looking for Great, cheap food, that tasted good 
I stopped by Juliobertos Dunlap location it has awesome food.

Plus I noticed they have good items not found at other locations.

I been coming here a while now and All the food is good

I do recommend to try the green chile burrito or carne Assad fries and the tacos."}
{"text":"This Julioberto's is one of the best drive thru Mexican places I have found of the '-bertos' restaurants. I have been coming to this location for 6 years. Previously it was a Filibertos. I have a Filibertos right by my house and I drive to this one because the food is far superior. The breakfast burritos are large and just chock full of bacon-- big bacon chunks not the little tiny chopped bacon bits you get at some places. The carne asada fries are truly a masterpiece. They manage to make them crispy enough not to get soggy but without being burned and you get a really big portion. They always seem to rotate in new burrito styles and some of them are new favorites. I have never had a problem with small portions, bad food or anything else ever at this location. The one thing I wish they would change is the drive through speaker. It sounds like they're yelling at you from 1952 through a tin can."}
{"text":"Came to get some burritos and I swear the lady and one of the cooks were drinking a corona while working like seriously who does that I took a picture but I don't really know how to posts picture here"}
{"text":"This used to be a Filiberto's for many years. About 6 months ago I noticed the food tasted different, not as good. I thought there must be a new chef and was hoping maybe he was just a fill-in for awhile. I kept coming back and being disappointed. I know you must think what an idiot for punishment I was but it had been so great for so many years I couldn't believe that the place would really become permanently bad. 

I always go through the drive-thru and I finally got so irritated with my food when I got it home I looked on the bag for the phone number. I wanted to call and ask why they changed their recipes. Then I saw the bag said \"Julioberto's\" not Filiberto's. The menu board outside never changed (neither did the phone number actually) and I just never noticed the different sign (the two look amazing alike).

I know the urban myth is that all the \"berto\" restaurants (Filiberto's, Julioberto's, Eriberto's, Humberto's) are run by the same family and the menus are identical. Maybe that's true but that would be where it ends. The menu items may be the same but the recipes are different.

As for the difference I don't think the quality of the ingredients is as good and the portions are much smaller. I always get the chili rellenos platter and a cheese quesadilla. The chili rellenos fried batter is too thick and and the poblano peppers are much smaller than they were. There isn't as much cheese put inside the pepper and that cheese doesn't taste as good. There is too much sauce and the meal overall seems to lack in seasoning. They are skimpy with the sour cream and lettuce, which doesn't taste fresh. The pico de gallo is tasteless and also doesn't seem fresh.The refried beans that come along with the meal don't have much taste and are runny. The cheese quesadilla is way smaller than it was, about half the size, and it also seems, and may be, microwaved. There isn't as much cheese and it isn't as tasty as before.

I came yet back again with a friend. Her request and she was buying so why not. She wanted to see if the food really tasted that different. She said her Super Nachos weren't the same from when the place was a Filiberto's but she actually liked them better. I asked her why and she said that it had more sauce and a tastier sauce. I myself don't care for nachos with any sauce and wasn't aware it should have sauce. She said they also were more generous with the sour cream and pico de gallo than before.

Oh well to each his own. This Julioberto's isn't that bad, it just is when compared to when it was a Filiberto's with an identical menu."}
{"text":"I have to admit the quality of food here is better than your average berto's restaurant, However the girl who works the drive-through during the late shift makes some of the strangest mistakes with the food. Warning if your ordering 2 items don't be surprised to find them in one box combined into some strange hybrid. I honestly don't think she understands the word \"And\". This has happened to me several times int the last month. Always make sure to check your order here."}
{"text":"The food is great but if your looking for good customer service you might want to pick a different place to eat. I have never been treated so poorly and made to feel dumb when asking simple questions. Good food or not looks like I'm picking filebertos next time. Hey guy behind the counter try not being such a smart a$&"}
{"text":"Love Julioberto's!! My usual is a burrito with beans, potatoes and guacamole. Their green sauce is awesome. I think I might just like this place better than Filiberto's! Yum!!"}
{"text":"Why why why didn't I just order a taco and be done with it. I ordered a chicken salad because I wanted to eat somewhat healthy today.  The lettuce was all white, hard and from the core.  The chicken was hardly even chicken and had bits of fat all over it.  The only thing that was decent in the salad was the avocado.  So I basically ate avocado dipped in ranch.  TERRIBLE. I am throwing up in my mouth thinking of that salad. Gross."}
{"text":"Do not recomend this place. Horrible customer service. I order food and call to politely let them know they made my food wrong and  that i would ike to come up to ehchange for what i ordered. The lady calls me a liar saying they don't make food like that (what i explained i recieved) and I tell her I will bring her what they made so she can see. I sent my boyfriend and he shows her and just laughs and says she will get the right food. He gets home and my food isn't even warm. I am not going again and I'm not eating my food.. so now I wasted money gas and I'm still hungry. I am very dissappointed. Don't waste your time at this establishment as I did. It use to be a nice place with good food a year ago but quality of food and customer service has went down a great deal."}
{"text":"I have haven't eaten at too many of these establishments because the last one i tried just dirty. I was really wanting a tamale cause i haven't had one for the season yet. Honestly i wasn't expecting much. What i got was probably the best tamale i have had in a really long time. It tasted like it was made FRESH, not some premade, frozen thing i have gotten from other places.  I was pleasantly surprised.  
The location was clean, floors and bathroom was clean. The salsa bar was clean and the cucumbers actually tasted good, where other places have a funny after taste. 
The service was good and the cashier was nice. I would go back to this one."}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat, breakfast, lunch and dinner!  The food is always amazing and of course very filling as well!  You won't leave here with empty pockets or not enough to eat either!  Their staff is the best and do everything to make sure you get what you want to eat and will change anything on the menu to your taste!  I've even gotten taste's (which really could be called a meal in some places! if I wasn't sure I'd like the dish.  It's also the cleanest place around, really hard to beat anytime of day!"}
{"text":"I love Julioberto's and and the plethora of restaurants that are just like them..  and I like to write positive reviews on places, but not this time.  As this is the closest one to me I have frequented it many times..  My kids LOVE carne assada frys.  Their rolled taco's are pretty good too.. but dont order anything complicated.  
I have to say something about what I just got from here.  I got a carnitas torta.  I Love torta's.  This was the worst one I have EVER HAD anywhere.. The pork was dried out.. tasted like eating shredded jerky.  Not just one bite, but every single piece of pork in the sandwich.  I swear they went looking for the scrap pork to put on my sandwich.  Its not like I did anything to tick off the cook or something.. got it in the drive thru.  There was nothing on the sandwich but pork, lettuce and guacamole.  Very bland.  I need to find a new place."}
{"text":"Foods pretty good. However,they usually mess your order up . Double check the bag before leaving."}
{"text":"First of all, Connie gets 5-Stars!   She knows how asinine this place is.   
$1 for each topping.....Lettuce is $1.... Tomatoes is $1.....Diced Onions is  $1....Who Does That!"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Julio's! Their menu alone puts Taco Bell and DelTaco to shame. With a wide variety of items to choose from, including dishes with shrimp and fish, it is hard to NOT to find something to eat. What I love most about this place is that it is open 24 hours. The staff is ALWAYS friendly and has even cut me some slack on occasions when I placed the wrong order--they were kind and even made me an entire new plate. Also, the portions are quite large, I often can split a meal with a friend if we're not super hungry. You can also dine in at Julio's. They have a clean inside environment with plenty of booths and tables. 
I recommend the Chimichanga--chicken or steak, or the Carne Asada burritos."}
{"text":"One of the better \"-bertos\" in both consistency and quality. This is our go-to for quick and simple Mexican fast food. Staff is always professional and exceptionally friendly, and they provide my personal favorite \"no frills\" fish tacos. Having to wait a few minutes for our order only confirms each is made fresh. Pure curbside goodness."}
{"text":"I admit, I'm a regular here. It's on my way home from work and they have taco specials on certain nights. Some things they just do better and more authentically than other Berto's. Lengua, Tripas, Machaca, Menudo. I just crave it! And they always remember me and if they think I might show up, they save my favorite for me because it's so good, it goes fast! fast! fast!!!!"}
{"text":"Anyone wasting their time complaining about this place should buzz off. Live right down the street and they always handle my weird/slightly picky requests without a question or annoyance. (Ex: huevos rancheros plate but in a tortilla) the list goes on, and gets even more weird. They rock!

Bringing it down to three stars. Although they are cool with my strange requests.. They refused to make my huevos ranchero burrito with fried eggs vs. scrambled. Offered to pay more for it, promised I was okay with any mess.. And they still said no. 

Moral of the story: I miss airebertos on 7th and bell."}
{"text":"I got diarrhea and possible food poisoning from this place. Enough said."}
{"text":"The food is amazing. I got nacho supreme -  it was delicious! They made my night. Thanks for being so amazing and making the food with love."}
{"text":"We were traveling thru Phoenix  looking for some Mexican food  and just happened to see Juliobertos . So we stopped and ordered and were very pleased. I've never had such good Mexican as I had at this place. I just regret that we don't live nearby so we can have it more often. Thanks to the chef!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed nothing about my experience here. I went last week and tried the enchiladas, rolled tacos, and quesadilla... Pretty basic standard food right? Not here. I still can't get the disgusting out of my mouth."}
{"text":"This place is the good, the bad, and the ugly.  Not the best place for sober or drunk munchies.  Like the chips & salsa (they don't tell you, but it's actually really good Pico de Gallo). Unfortunately the chips are soggy after 1 minute. Good but soggy. I highly recommend getting chips with pico on the side. There's your bad. The good? Shrimp burro or quesadilla. Love the shrimp entrees... wish I loved the meat entrees, which leads me to the ugly: breakfast burritos.  They claim to have egg, which is true,  but it's basically like claiming to be a yummy breakfast item when all you taste is grisly, overseasoned & overcooked meat. Egg is lost in the burro's ill-flavored meat. Too bad."}
{"text":"I would rather travel all the way to this location. I live right across the street from a Filibertos but I rather go to Julio bertos the food is way better and the customer service is great the cook comes out and says hi and asks about the food. the portions are way better than the other restaurants the beef tacos have a lot of flavor. Yes the food is greasy but if you don't want greasy food go by the salad. Everywhere every restaurant uses Frozen food or some type of processed food this place is very good always clean. If you are a good customer treat employees with respect they will do the same if you act like assholes they'll treat you the same"}
{"text":"Great food for a 24 hour joint. I dig the nachos, rolled tacos and the Arizona burrito. They always get my order right, so that is impressive for a drive thru place. The drive thru is popular so patience is a virtue."}
{"text":"got the chorizo breakfast burrito... not bad i actually went back and got it again one time, only like 5 bucks and was massive, considering trying other things.  i wouldnt say it was \"awesome\" but it was good if that helps.  but i havent tried anything else like i said but id give it a chance if ur starving and want to go through a drive through."}
{"text":"Yesterday afternoon was the worst service I have ever gotten at this location.  The guy was borderline rude. I got the 5 rolled tacos and it was awful. The guy gave me no receipt or I would have called.  The was practically no cheese and sour cream was slopped every where. I have been going here since they opened and the rolled tacos are more expensive here than down the street. Which is where I will go next time. Not impressed.  Wish I would have taken a picture. Will go somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"This place is sad...  plastic forks styrofoam plates  food has no taste they say chicken enchiladas but they filled it with fake cheese.."}
{"text":"A great little place that has THE BEST Mexican nachos ever. Just spicy enough & there's plenty for 2 servings. All of the employees at the window service have been very nice & all the food is affordably priced! You can eat-in or sit outside but it is a busy intersection, if traffic noise bothers you."}
{"text":"The communication and customer service seem to be lacking every time, and the accuracy of my meal often suffers. But we come back for the yummy food at a good price every once in a while. If not for the convenience of the location, I probably wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"Another homer with a chile relleno burrito.
I had to write this as soon as I got home at 3AM.
Professional uniforms, good service, not fly by the seat of your pants like a certain \"berto's\" on Mcdowell. What also stands apart is late at night ----
INSIDE SKINNY:  Go in and get some KILLER salsas to go! They're well-stocked Saturday night late! Low crowd level (Lonesometown) so THIS is the off the beaten path you wanna hit, it's not too far off the 51."}
{"text":"I have continued to have poor service at this particular location. Have come in here 3 times now, early morning and was never waited on. I wondered if there was anyone working, even after shouting hello. There was not a single employee in the building. Turn your open sign off if you're not going to have people available to serve customers. Or get a door chime or bell at the counter so they know they have a customer. Really disappointing."}
{"text":"I made my way to another place ending with \"berto's\".  There's not much to say.  Some people hate these places, some love 'em, some are indifferent.  I think they're pretty good and hard to distinguish between them.  Don't go out of your way but if you're in the area, go for it.

I ordered the beef taco and enchilada combo and washed it down with the Jamaica drink.  Good times.  Not the best of times.  Good times.

The food here isn't going to blow your mind but it won't leave you vomiting either."}
{"text":"I hate this place!!! Every time I've gone there, they've gave me the wrong order. Onetime I had to drive back, and got a refund, cause they got my oder completely wrong. Then I was in the drive thru and sat there for 10 minutes. I just ordered one thing. The response from the girl was \"Sorry\", in a I don't care attitude. I'll never go there again EVER!!!!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good considering it's from Arizona. It's not quite cali style but pretty much a standard cali taco shop in and out. Plastic forks and styrofoam are common in taco shops, what do you want ceramic plates and silver ware??? Get real gabachos!!! Flip flops and shorts year round CALI lifestyle!!! BOOM"}
{"text":"I come here for one thing, so my rating is for one thing....their shrimp burrito...it is the BOMB! You get a home made (tasting tortilla) filled with big juicy shrimp and the perfect amount of rice, cabbage and their special ranch sauce that pulls it all together for the perfect bite! The burrito is also gigantic so you won't be hungry when you're done with this bad boy! Who'd have thunk that this little shop could produce such a winner? Oh, by the way, not all locations serve the same food or make the food the same way. Glendale & 7th St is worth the trip!"}
{"text":"This review pertains to carnitas, and as such should not be taken as a suggestion for ordering any of the following: fish tacos, rice, beans, horchata. That's about it! Yum!"}
{"text":"I typically like the berto places but they certainly range from location to location.  This one is NOT a good one.

Try Filberto's a mile down the road on 30th street and Indian (newly remodeled and clean, they also give you chips while you wait) or Armando's on 36th and Thomas.

These rec's of course are limited only to Berto's type of places.  If your not in a hurry the list changes entirely."}
{"text":"Giving this place one star is generous. The service was not that great. They didn't seem to want to wait on us and they weren't that friendly. The cook was rude and got really belligerent when we made a special request, which wasn't really that difficult. The burrito had a few pieces of meat, otherwise it was full of peppers and onions, and mostly tortilla. I was told the enchilada I ordered would be Shredded beef. It was just cheese. And the food was very bland. First and last time I'll ever go there."}
{"text":"Wait time is approx. 15 minutes in drive thru even tho the place is entirely empty. You drive home to realize they gave you the wrong order. You drive back and wait another 15 minutes for the correct order. You ask for a refund of the difference since the order that gave you first was more expensive and they say \"it was only some cents\". I had this gut feeling that they would spit in my food. Didnt even eat comfortably."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is consistently good. I used to live around the corner and would eat here all the time. Stop here every time I'm on this side of town. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I tried Julioberto's once and it was decent. It wasn't the best Mexican food I have ever had, but I enjoyed it. Prices aren't too bad and we didn't have to wait long for our food. It was a fairly average place. I liked it, but it didn't really 'wow' me!"}
{"text":"The tacos were delicious. The best hard shell tacos my BF ever had. I got fish  tacos (also good) so they came w/ soft shells. Low cost and amazing quality. No photos.  We ate it too fast.

Open 24 hours!"}
{"text":"I'd give it a zero star but it won't give you the option,, I just ate a lettuce taco and half way through my son was going to eat the rest and he found a Maggot! So freaking discussing! I actually liked this place but now can't go again after seeing that foul disgusting Maggitt crawling in my food!!"}
{"text":"This is my first review, and I just decided to do it even before receiving my food because I've been coming here for a year or so roughly now. I got myself some carne asada fries, pretty typical for me, but I have certainly eaten and enjoyed a variety of other items from them. The employees are never talkative, but straight to the point in getting orders made and delivered as quickly as possible. My carne asada fries were amazing! It's almost as if they gave me extra if everything: guac, sour cream, cheese, AND meat. This is definitely a very delicious and extremely filling meal. The fries weren't greasy, and the meat was so tender. Be prepared for a good meal when you come here."}
{"text":"Amazing the food is so good forget Taco Bell. Service is a little bit slower than most fast food places but  the food is well worth it!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. It's right around the corner from my house and I go here a few times a month. I mainly get the carne Asada fries, breakfast burritos, and rolled tacos. The carne Asada fries and breakfast burritos are pretty delicious. The rolled tacos are just sorta meh but are great after a night of drinking.
The reason they get 4 stars and not 5 is because of how slow the drive thru can be sometimes. I only go thru the drive thru if I don't see anyone else waiting, If there's another car in the drive thru, I'll park and go inside. Once I waited behind a car and it took 8 minutes to get my food from the moment I placed my order. That's waaaay too long to wait in a drive thru for fast food.
Overall, the food here is pretty good and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I was kind of dubious about this place, being a \"-berto's\" joint and all, but it's pretty terrific grub. The service is great and they keep the dining area squeaky clean with a widescreen TV tuned into a Mexican news station. They also have free wi-fi, which I haven't yet tried. I swung by there today and had the carne asada torte. This is a huge sandwich (about 9\"x6\") with a swatch of thinly sliced beef, lettuce, tomato and guacamole, served on a yummy homemade roll. It's served with french fries, a heckuva deal for $3.99. I've also had their burrito plate, easily big enough for two meals. Delicious, affordable, filling, what more can one ask for. At the very least, you can sit in this repurposed Burger King and dig the circa 1991 decor."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food I have EVER eaten!!! Great portion sizes and quality authentic food."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and I got it in a timely manner. The only complaint are the prices, everything is so over priced. Seems like prices have doubled within the last year. Paid $11 for just carne asada fries with extra cheese. Honestly will only come back if I'm having a dire need for them again lol."}
{"text":"They're open 24/7. I came in at 1am because I had a lay over at Pheonix Sky Harvor Airport and I ordered a No.1 (tacos de lengua). It was really good and very good portions."}
{"text":"This is my first review ever just fyi! I just got hime right now with the purchase I mad which made me pretty unhappy when i seen the guacamole from idk how many days ago, i would lie if i said it tastes gross but it sure looks disgusting!!"}
{"text":"Great place with great service!  Food was made while I waited and hot and fresh.  Also great flavor will defiantly return!"}
{"text":"The kitchen in this location is kept remarkably clean, and the employees are congenial and generous. The salsa bar is always stocked, the decor is cheery and bright, and the cheese enchilada combo is where it's at. If you are picking up an order to go, though, sure to specify to separate pico de gallo from chips, because your chips will be soggy by the time you get home."}
{"text":"I went here because my S.O. got a chicken salad a few weeks ago,and it was pretty good.  Unfortunately, my experience here today was less than stellar.  

When I walked in, the place immediately smelled of rancid grease.  Not a good start.  Then, after ordering and taking home our breakfast, I noticed the following issues:

1. The wrappers for our burritos as well as the tortillas were soaked in grease.  I think I've seen less grease in an auto shop.
2. The eggs in the breakfast burritos were not just overcooked, they were practically charred.
3. The ham in said burritos was nearly grey.  The only color it had was a slight orange sheen from the grease.
3. The pork in the carne adovada was dry. And the red chile it \"marinated\" in was nearly room temperature.
4. The guacamole tasted and looked like it was store bought.

Please, save yourselves the indigestion and avoid this place at all costs if you value your intestines or taste buds.  If the owners have any decency, they'll close this place before they poison a customer."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican fast food. Food is fresh and they are friendly. I eat here a few times a week!"}
{"text":"I know the other reviewer was not happy , I could see where how it would be easy to have that experience here. But I have eaten here on several occasion, usually I get some type of burrito, never been disappointed.They have a salsa bar , so I dig in , every time ."}
{"text":"This place used to be Filibertos but is now Juliobertos.  I've been a few times as it's close to my work and sometimes I crave some carne asada.  Juliobertos is the same exact thing as a Filibertos but not as good.  Not that Filibertos has been good for about 10 years.  Remember back in the day when you could get a huge foot long carne asada burrito for just over 3 bucks?  Those days are long gone.  There is more tortilla than carne asada inside these burritos.  Their tacos are also greasy and lacking in flavor.  I've also had the nachos which were made with hamburger meat and what tasted like canned refried beans.  Grease overload.  The flies on the window were Gods way of asking me why would you put this garbage in the body I gave you?"}
{"text":"I was not expecting much from the exterior, but the food is actually quite good! I had the carnitas burrito and it was tasty, full of fresh ingredients, and the tortilla was delicious. Great late night chow."}
{"text":"As clear as I was when I ordered CHICKEN ENCHILADAS they gave me CHEESE ENCHILADAS which is frustrating because I can't tell just by looking at them and since I ordered through the drive thru I can't return them. Big difference between the two. Don't come here the guy that works late nights doesn't know what he's doing and is very hard to communicate with."}
{"text":"The only item I shall ever order is their cheese quesadilla because the cheese is pleasing to thine soul especially when the green is burning and their green sauce tickles the roof of my mouth and the night has fallen like humpty dumpty if you know what i mean, be nice and go there and put their food in your bones."}
{"text":"2 pennies in my burrito!!! I thought the night of Thursday Oct 27 was gonna be a quiet night. It was 8pm and I was heading to a friend's house for a little pumpkin carving action. I was hungry and started thinking about the local places I could stop by. A burrito was decided on due to it's deliciousness and ease of eating while driving. Julioberto's was close by and besides being in my mind, Filiberto's evil twin's place, it had served me well in the past with quick, quasi-authentic, delicious mexican food. 

I there and I order the carne asada burrito, that's it. No sides, no off-brand can of soda, nothing else. Just a carne asada burrito through the drive through. I drive off, hungrily unwrapping my burrito. 5 minutes later I'm to the lower third of my burrito, strategically trying to eat more of the innards pf the burrito than the tortilla to avoid the dreaded phenomenon of a burrito becoming more stuffed and busting through it's tortilla wrapping near the end. The next bite surprised me. I felt something hard and metallic. After a careful inspection I find a shiny penny in my burrito. Come on Juilo! A penny, I'm not even a clean freak. Hell if I would have gotten a quarter I'd probably have been excited. So embarrassingly enough I keep eating the burrito. I mean, honest mistake right? Like I said, I'm not a clean freak and probably trust in my immune system probably way too much. A few bites later it happens again. Another penny and this time it's kinda gross looking. Don't worry, this time I quit eating my burrito.

Ok how does a penny get in a burrito? Are their no cash registers there. Do you have the burrito maker carrying all the change? And how does a penny, no 2 pennies, start wherever they are, end up in a burrito. This is the thing that probably bother me the most. The logistics of this whole deal. Anyways. Julio and Berto, I love your restaurant and will probably eat there again, which is adding a star for you. But come on, at least give me some quarters next time."}
{"text":"Kick @$$ The Best of the bertos & they will make anything you want_!! Carne Asada with Sausage & Ham........Wow.."}
{"text":"Customer service wise, I don't think they have an understanding of what that topic is. Plus they charged me extra for a specific burrito I ordered. So o went another time, same order charged me the same amount. Confronted them the third time, he gave me excuses. As soon as he told me it's due to an \"add on\" which i always agree on the add on. But there was no add on, both times. Be Aware of them OVER CHARGING YOU without your consent. 
Food taste is fresh, they also left out a key ingredient both the time I had the burrito, and he argued that I had requested it off, I showed him a picture, and being not trained by a professional, just gave me a ridiculous answer that it's in there, but just a little bit of it. Where you could clearly see in couple of the pics that there was no BEANS. I'm sorry to say, just having bad customer service I would not go back there anytime soon. 
It's beyond customer service, plus quality for the amount they are charging is not there."}
{"text":"Can't  believe  how bad food was!!!!
I ordered 2 Gorditas, when I got to work( 4 min away) craving to eat my gorditas I  opened  the box and what a surprise 
the tortilla  was cold with a slap of meat inside, sour cream on the side with a little  lettuce .
NEVER AGAIN.....


I don't  recommend this  Place at all..."}
{"text":"They need to work on cleanliness at this eating establishent. All the salsa at the salsa bar looked almost watered down and old.  Almost every table in the lobby was dirty and I don't even want to mention the restrooms.  I will skip this place next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"This place is pretty much the bottom of the food chain.  I just stopped by the drive through counter and ordered lunch.  First off, the gal at the window was REALLY RUDE and condescending.  Not sure why, I was just there to buy lunch and support the place and give it a try.  When I got the food home, the order was wrong, and the taco salad was tiny.  At any rate, I would recommend this place only to people I did not like!  Hahaha.  Seriously, would NEVER go back.  Don't let me forget, food was not very tasty, the taco shells sort of have that greasy taste.  Not for me."}
{"text":"Great Mexican FOOD overall. However I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone looking for quality service. My order was incorrect, the wait was over an hour, but the food was good."}
{"text":"Prices are right but the food was terrible.  Very processed. Taisted like it came out of a microwave. And to boot they got my simple order wrong of a beef enchilada and a taco..... it was there daily special even. Lol . If you dont like food that instantly makes you sick then dont go here! 

This is the first bad review i have given on yelp.  And i yelp ALOT."}
{"text":"Heard about this place and there amazing Carne Asada Fries. So my wife and I decided to try it out. Place is SUPER CLEAN and the people there are very friendly. I got to meet the owner of the place same person that owns it cooks as well. Tried out the carne asada fries and OMG soooo good and fresh! The meat was very flavorful and the guacamole was PERFECT!! None of that packaged stuff, this was legit Guac!! Owner was super cool that O took a picture with him and my order lol!! Will go back again and try out the other food!!!"}
{"text":"They have great specials and if you like dive mexican take out......its ok.....there are much better places that are not a chain."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a quality burrito in downtown Phoenix. This place is clean inside and always has a welcoming staff! I would recommend this place to anyone looking for authentic Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Happiness prevails here because:
I CRAVE this Salsa Verde and they just happen to offer:

24-hour drive-thru, 24-hour breakfast, Substitutes whole egg with only whites on request for the country breakfast burrito.....ayiyi! Mexi-heaven :)

Breakfast of this champion, New Year's diet or not!"}
{"text":"Very fast drive through! Machaca Breakfast burrito was a big size, and less than 5 bucks! It was very good with bell peppers, eggs, and onion! 2 salsas red and green! My only complaint is a little more seasoning world have made it perfect! Even the tortilla was fresh!"}
{"text":"What's worse than greasy Mexican food? COLD Greasy Mexican food!  I ordered the super nachos which were slathered in cold beans and unmelted cheese. Gross! My man ordered the cheese enchilada, which was also cold and full of unmelted cheese. In general, the food was cold and not satisfying. We would have given them 2 to 3 stars, since they have a salsa bar and lots of cheap combo plates. But the a/c was broken, making our dining experience even more unpleasant. Heck the restaurant was hotter than the food!  Pass it up, folks."}
{"text":"Been going here for years. Lately the food is inconsistent. Salsa is ok, sometimes good sometimes no flavor. See the same staff a lot and have told them but it never changes. Went last night and the rice was crunchy."}
{"text":"The best freaking tortilla I have ever had in my life, hands down!  Yes, I'm a ****bertos addict and just when I didn't think it couldn't get any better it did!!!  I just got back from Mexico and this is still the best burrito I have EVER HAD.  Adobada ROCKS!  I have seriously eaten at almost every dive mexican joint in the Phoenix area and will go out of my way to eat here from now on.  

Great drive through service and the LARGE size red AND green sauces are the bomb!!!"}
{"text":"I like this place sober.  Most people go to restaurants like this when they are full of booze.  I have never had a bad or off meal here and the service is fast and friendly.  My favorites are the rolled tacos, bean burrito with cheese, or if I am really feeling decadent - the carne asada fries.  Also, it is important to note that their beans taste like beans my Grandma would have made.  There is no Pinesol aftertaste in the food.  Do you know what I mean?"}
{"text":"every single time I go there My order is wrong ,, I say for beans in a burro ,they don't put the beans in.. I pay for cheese on a burro you don't it .. And they I ordered a plate which come with a tortilla ,,, No tortilla.   
The problem is that you get all the way home and its missing,,who wants to drive back.. I don't"}
{"text":"Right on the building it says that they are open 24 hours - the past two times that I've tried to go through the drive through of this establishment, I've waited about 5 minutes for someone to ask me what I would like to order. No one ever would and then I drove past the drive through window just to see that the lights were on, but no one took my order. 

Not to mention the fact that I've gotten here around 8 o'clock, which is a pretty standard breakfast time. 

The one time that I actually got to enjoy it, it was decent. I feel like you have to wait a long time to get your food. 

If it is no longer 24 hours, it'd be great to know so I don't have to sit there and wait for no reason."}
{"text":"I love this place! Better than filibertos for sure. Every time I go I always get amazing food and service. Highly recommend their super nachos and carne asada fries!"}
{"text":"I have a potato, egg and cheese burrito here at least once a week.  It is soooo yummy!  It tastes better than Filibertos and Eribertos.  It's bigger too!  The staff is really friendly.  I haven't had a bad experience yet.  If you use CC they charge you $.50.   If you go inside they have the typical salsa bar.  Carrots are really crunchy. mmm"}
{"text":"They try to charge you .50 cents through the drive through for extra hot sauce but there's a salsa bar inside. They also mess up orders frequently."}
{"text":"Mexican Junk Food you just gotta LOVE IT. Lunch at least once a week. Brought my team here for a staff meeting and got voted Best Boss Ever On The Planet!  

Shredded Beef Taco with the Red salsa.  Bean/Cheese Tostado with the Most Excellent Green sauce that makes my scalp tingle - I think its a jalapeno avocado sauce (?) and it is Muy Excellente (end of bilingual vocabulary).YES to the lettuce, its cold, crisp and totally soaks up the junk food juice!

Staff is Always Nice and Always Friendly and they got a nice new iced tea machine so its fresh every time I hit it!"}
{"text":"We go here for breakfast burrito on occasion and when they decide they will be open. They have open 24hours signs up but there have been numerous times where we have tried going between 6 am -8 am and not a soul is there. Sometimes they even have a cone blocking the drive through. So it's hit or miss if they will even be open when you go. Not sure why they just don't update their signs. They clearly are NOT open 24 hours."}
{"text":"Food definitely doesn't taste as good as the one on 19th and Thunderbird and Alex rolled his eyes the entire time I was trying to correct the order he messed up..thought it would be better because it's brand new but I thought wrong. I won't ever go back to that location."}
{"text":"Oh, Julioberto's how I appreciate thee.

I live down the street.  I am white, lower middle-class, educated, a 15 year veteran of the food service industry and a bit of a food snob (read:  fast food frequently isn't entirely made of FOOD) so believe me when I say that this place is the real deal.

Yes, the humans who work here occasionally make mistakes.  They will also rectify their errors if they are made aware of them.

The food is consistently fresh and delicious.  I've been advised by people of the culture Julioberto's represents that it is a spot-on example of home cooking, Mexican style.

The drive-through makes it easy.  They have patio seating which only does anyone any good during the tolerable months (Oct - April)

Yes the building is old and shows signs of wear - they spend their efforts and money not on superficial things but on the food that goes out the window.

Don't listen to me, or any of the others - go try it for yourself  and make a decision THAT way... the only way that's really valid.

PS the pork adobada is divine."}
{"text":"Adobada burritos and tortas are on point. The Green salsa is perfect too. I've gone many times and other than an occasional small error I'm almost never disappointed. I've never eaten inside so I can't remark on the inside facility, but the takeout has been very solid. Tony always makes sure everything comes out perfect"}
{"text":"It's just your regular Filberto's but it's Julio's....

If you want the ultimate Filberto's/Julioberto's experience, hit up the Filberto's on Thomas St and Rural Road.  That place is awesome!  It's a nice restaurant experience with a kickass bar!  The people who work there are really what put it over the top."}
{"text":"I make the drive to the original filibertos right up 19th ave.  This place is extremely dirty on the inside if you decide to eat there. The food isn't great either. Much better at the authentic restaurant up the street."}
{"text":"Horrible place!!!!        Horrible  customers service!!!! If they don't like they're job!!! It's not my problem"}
{"text":"they have a pretty darn good chorizo and egg burrito. it has alot less grease than filibertos but they are still not on armandos level."}
{"text":"Absolutely recommend!!! Such amazing service, the food is always wonderful, and the restaurant is clean and has a great atmosphere. Come here every chance I get, and am always satisfied with my visit!!!"}
{"text":"Carne asada burrito and soda is $10 , on par with filibertos but there are a lotof differences.  Soda dispenser here is behind counter so no refills, carne asada had so few spices (no garlic?) that it was a bland burrito."}
{"text":"Carne Asada meat was so grizzly I couldn't eat it. Nasty! The staff was super rude too. Yuck. Yuck. Yuck. Skip it!!"}
{"text":"I live very close to this location of Julioberto's and I have eaten at this location several times. The food has always been fast and good. However my experience last night changed my opinion of the restaurant. I am solely basing my review on this experience. 

Last night I went through the drive-thru and when I came to the window, I noticed individual styrofoam cups sitting on top of the soda fountain. A few seconds later I saw an employee drinking out of a styrofoam cup. He took a few sips, and then poured out the rest of his cup into the soda fountain drain below the dispensers. That freaked me out a bit, but not as much as what happened next. 

He then rinsed out his cup using the water dispenser on the fountain. He sloshed it around and then poured out the contents. The contents splashed all over the dispenser and into the ice maker that was just below the drain. He then placed his drinking cup on top of the dispenser with the rest of the styrofoam cups. Water was still dripping off the side of the cup and on to the fountain.  A second later another employee started filling my cup with ice from the same ice maker.  

When I expressed disgust at what I had just observed, I was told, \"It is okay.\"  I am not sure that she understood what I was trying to tell her, because she was confused as to why I no longer wanted a soda. The lack of hygiene appalled me. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Hella cheap
Hella fast
Hella good

Another day, another burrito. Ordered the chile relleno burrito and added veggies to it and it was surprisingly good. The poblano was deep fried and I slathered it in the salsa verde / smokier salsa rojo from the salsa bar. Food came out lightening quick and location was very convenient to the venue next door."}
{"text":"The food was okay enjoyed the tacos. The customer service was great felt welcomed by the employees."}
{"text":"Came in at 7am. I ordered and went into the bathroom too wash my hands.  This place was horrible. Dinning room looked dirty and the bathroom stunk like a horrible sour smell and look disgusting.  I washed my hands but there was no soap, paper towels and the electric hand dryer wasn't working.  It looked like blood splatter on the floor but I  THINK it was red paint drippings.   There wasn't even toilet paper in the stall.  This bathroom was stinkier and dirtier than any I have been to in Mexico.  The dining room was freezing cold.  It felt like there was no heat and it was 44 degrees!  Just waiting now forum my food...  Huevos Ranchero which I now have.  The eggs should be Sunnyside up with soft yolk..  It was fried almost crisp and the yolk had been broken and practically missing. It also had shredded cheddar cheese on it.  The eggs were on top of a huge pile of pico de gallo. I never saw huevos ranchero with cheese and pico...  It is usually on top of corn tortillas covered with ranchero salsa. Beans were straight up from a can. 

One word to some Julioberto's up...  Ewww!  Run away...  Run far away!"}
{"text":"It makes me so sad to say this but I have given up on you Juliobertos.

I ordered my last bean and cheese burrito from there yesterday and was SHOCKED when I found what resembled to be a PUBIC HAIR in the spillage coming out of the bottom of my burrito.

So disgusting, I am never going back. I used to eat there ALL THE TIME too. Makes me shiver to think what else I could've eaten there before."}
{"text":"Ok...so don't go to the Filaberto's down the street on 32nd St. and Indian School drive the extra  mile and go here...This place is so so so much better.

Things that are must haves...any carne asada burrito...so good and they are huge...get the #15 on the menu it is so worth it, you get 2 carne asada burritos with beans and rice and a drink for like $10. 
Important::::
And ask for the guacamole salsa, I believe it is exclusive to this location and might be the best thing ever invented. I always get extra to put in my eggs the next morning for breakfast. So good.
::::

The shrimp taco's here are bomb.com I mean...they are so frickin good, I could eat them everyday..

And lastly the piece of resistance is the carne asada super nachos...I don't care where you go this place has the best nachos in Phoenix. They give you a Styrofoam container heaped and I mean heaped with refried beans, rice, guac, sour-cream, carne asada and chips this thing is so big it could seriously choke a pig...this thing probably weighs in close to 5 pounds...this is not an exaggeration...I seriously need to weigh one of these one day. 

This place is open 24 hours and I must say is my guilty pleasure, if your on a diet don't go here, but if its a cheat day and you are looking to indulge...dive in. 

I love this place..."}
{"text":"I confess. I eat here. I can't hide it anymore and it's hypocritical of me not to give them a good review. I refuse to check the county health inspection records because I just don't want to know. In fact, I have been eating at Filibertos restaurants since the early 90s, in Tucson. This location is the closest to where I live today. My usual order is the Arizona Burrito, and I almost always get a medium Horchata with it. Occasionally I go for the cheese enchilada with rice and beans. 

Open 24 hours."}
{"text":"Now known as Julioberto's, Great for FAST, GOOD, TASTY Mexican fare. I pop in here when I'm nearby for their Chili Verde Burrito(all chili, no rice or beans). Big portions and good prices"}
{"text":"A hit and miss...unfortunately tonight was a miss. I just love the chopped chicken salad but tonight the meat was burnt and the salad had a lot of water left in the container so it washed the flavor away = ( I can be super picky so I won't be coming back here for a while at least...and if I do it won't be when they're busy as that appears to be an indication of the food being half assed."}
{"text":"This place is a hack. I've been eating at various Bertos for 20 years. We've gone a few times to this place and it gets worse every time. Tonight they called my husband picky because he ordered my tortillas on the side of my burrito and no jalapeños on the nachos for our kids. He ordered beef tacos and we never got them.  Instead we got some chopped up chicken in a container. 

The carne Asada tasted a few days old and the tortillas were dried out. Eat at your own risk. Over priced and severely under delivered. Your better off driving 2 miles to Filibertos where they actually care about what they're doing. I hope this place gets shut down."}
{"text":"I rarely post reviews, almost never fir bad places...but this place sucks!!!! absolute worst Mexican food I've ever had! who puts salsa on the chips when you order chips and salsa to go?! by the time I got home, all of the chips were soggy! and the carne asada was not that, it was just unseasoned boiled meat! Taco Bell is better than this place! worst $10 ever spent!"}
{"text":"Boo!   When did green tomatillo salsa turn red?  At this place.  The drive thru girl actually tried to tell me that offred=green.   Never again will I stop here"}
{"text":"Only place that I've been to Mexican fast food wise that made my burrito correctly and it wasn't dry!!! 
Morning crew is nice also :-)"}
{"text":"Perhaps my ABSOLUTE go-to spot on the way home after work.  Service (from a drive through) is professional and personal! 
I am upset, however that they seem to have changed the recipe for refried beans... Since I always get Bean and Cheese Tostadas (the absolute best).... the beans suddenly tasted \"odd\". I gave it a couple of extra visits.... and, yep.... same flavor. 
Now, go to other locations where the flavor is good. Sad, because this is the closest location to
My home...."}
{"text":"Just off the plane, needing to get a quick bite before a meeting... we see a Jack in the Box.. and move on to Juliobertos!

Freshly made Mexican, good prices and the ease of a drive through!

I ordered a quesadilla - with carne asada.  Very delicious and fresh.  Flavorful beef too!  My only issue is that they didn't cut it into triangles... Which made me look like a savage trying to eat it - either way, I found a way to get it in my belly.

My friend got a chicken torta - some kind of sandwich.  He loved it too!

If you are ever in this area of town, its a great alternative to lame drive thru burgers!"}
{"text":"I got the chorizo breakfast burrito.  It was big and only $5, but contained nothing more than eggs and chorizo.  I was really hoping for more ingredients than just those two.  I had to add a ton of sauce to give it flavor."}
{"text":"This place has slipped significantly in the past 6 months.  No meat in the rolled tacos, smaller and smaller burritos, same or higher prices.  I would like to direct anyone close by to Armando's on 48th St and Thomas.  Cheaper, better tasting and larger portions.  This Filiberto's has become run-of-the-mill and cheap.  Other good reasons to stay away:  adjacent to a bus stop and a telemarketing joint.  Enough said."}
{"text":"food. But I don't go to fast food places to wait 15 minutes for a frickin burrito. 

Slowwwww


Update. Had to call food and safety on them. I saw the employee wipe sweat off of his forehead and then used his hands to make a burrito and grabbed lots of different food with his hands. All sweaty and never washed. Wanted to puke. Gf couldn't finish meal.

Update: last 2 times I've ordered a burrito they both had bone in them"}
{"text":"All kidding aside....This was a sad experience.  $11.00 later, I had a plate of two tacos and a single serving fountain drink.

Yupper, $11.00 for two carne asada tacos, rice beans.  I did not say 6 tacos.....

BTW, they charge for fountain soda refills.  1985 called, they want their business model back."}
{"text":"This place is well worth visiting.  If they charged double their low prices, I might give a lower rating, but for affordable, FAST, yummy Mexican food, this is the best one I've found in 20 years in Phoenix!  We had the enchiladas with beans, and I appreciated that there was only a little rice (which I always hate and forgot to tell them to leave off!)."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place gets such a bad name. Our office recently moved nearby and it's the closest Mexican restaurant. I've ate here several times and have never been sick. I had their Green Chile burrito today and I must admit, it was delicious! Give it a try."}
{"text":"Big Fan of this 24hr spot in the Biltmore area. Not the hood ...lol (Jason's post). As far as Mexican spots in central phx/biltmore area...this is your spot. This tops my list of places I luv late night but try to stay away from...lol...to avoid packing on those extra pounds.

I Totally recommend the Carne Asada Burrito and the Green Avacado salsa...soo good. I wish they sold it bottled up.

The food is excellent and you always get too much ....."}
{"text":"Breakfast was awesome - fresh huevos rancheros with steaming hot corn tortillas. Yum!"}
{"text":"Just about any ---bertos around town is going to be a good bet. It just happens that the Filibertos in my neighborhood semi-recently changed to Juliobertos, but I haven't really noticed much change in the food.

Anyway, Juliobertos is my go-to for a good, hearty, cheap burrito on the go. Their tortillas are really good, and what's inside is even better. I usually go for a bean-cheese-rice-guacamole burrito with tons of hot sauce which is awesome in every way possible, but if you're feeling like something so heavy you won't want to eat for the next 12 hours but it irresistably delicious I'd go for the Arizona burrito, which has Carne Asada, potatoes, pico de gallo and cheese. Although, I remember that one being way better when it was Filiberto's..."}
{"text":"One of the Valley's best taco and burrito shop. Not only are they all over the Valley but they are open late!

My favorites are the carnitas burrito and the beef tacos!  I hear they have other tasty eats on the menu although I've honestly never tried anything else. I'm too satisfied with my dual favorites thus far. 

The salsa bar is great and the pickled veggies rock!  Go hungry!

I find that they have 'gringo' friendly service."}
{"text":"I'm going to agree with SK. I live real close and I've been raised on Authentic mexican food and this place is great. I'm also in the food service biz, experienced some fairly frightening/disgusting things, but julioberto's $1 taco's are my favorite in Phoenix. Favorite taco's. not cheap tacos, favorite altogether! I've been coming here for years and have yet to be disappointed. When my order has been messed up, they were quick and happy to correct it. I'd drive here, but I'm lucky enough to be able to get there in less than a 5 minute walk."}
{"text":"Had a simple machaca burrito and the peppers and onions were undercooked.  The red sauce tastes like bleach and the bathrooms were \"out of order.\"  Wonder what the staff uses?  Not a soul in the place and I felt like they were rushing be out at 9:00 on a Thursday."}
{"text":"The cook wanted to fight me he dare me to get out of the car than the close the window at us after we pay even tho she heard the cook threatening us she laughing us she close the glass"}
{"text":"This place hired my step son to work and had him work 1 day to see how he would do. They said they'd call back, never called back and never paid him for the day he worked. This isn't Mexico, you have to pay for working 1 day,  you don't get free labor in the United States."}
{"text":"Have been here several times. Always the drive-thru. Takes a little longer than most, but the food tastes fresh and is good. Mostly have had their burritos and all have been pretty good. Problem is, even though they say they are 24 hours, I don't believe they are. Went there at 7:45 this morning (Sunday) for a breakfast burrito and nobody answered the drive thru and when I drove up to the window, nobody was there. That's pretty bad service. The good news is that I discovered a better place just around the corner on Miller Rd - a permanent food truck called Salsitas. Limited menu, but very good breakfast burritos (can't vouch for the other stuff since I haven't tried it yet).  I'd skip Julioberto's since you can't depend on their hours."}
{"text":"Bacon quesadilla. That's it. You don't need to really order anything else. But if you did then the rolled tacos with guac or the carne 
asada burrito are worthy."}
{"text":"They have a fast drive thru. Food is always good.  Killer carna asada fries,so good! Tacos rock also."}
{"text":"Don't go here unless you wanna be sick. The food sucks. Tastes like bargain basement mexican food."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 quesadilla and 5 rolled tacos. First off she tried to add extra beans. Politely told her at checkout no beans we did not ask for that. Then she give us food. Slams window on me while I ask for one more hot sauce. Turns out she gave me one less quesadilla then we asked for. They are awful don't go there."}
{"text":"I've lived in the neighborhood for about 10 years.   I used to love the quesadillas.   I think they changed their cheese.  The tortillas smell funky and the cheese is no good anymore.  It's almost like fake cheese or something.  I dunno.   Glad there are now more options for fast Mexican food in the area."}
{"text":"ZERO stars. Horrible. Complete wrong order even after they verified our order. Disgusting food and terrible service."}
{"text":"One of the cleanest Julioberto's forsure hands down fast friendly and good good job guys"}
{"text":"Way better than the location on Glendale. A bertos with a low carb menu? It's like a dream that only I would have. Not super greasy, but still hits that special 2am spot that can only be satisfied by Mexican food."}
{"text":"The young girl at the drive thru window is very rude, she don't smile, she gets all the orders wrong! Even after you re-peat it! I called her to explain she messed up our order for the 7rh time, and she hung up on me! I think giving a person more than 6 time errors is very reasonable! Aside from her (being I would fire her for poor customer service, plus she's always mean/rude...) The actual restaurant is very clean, well kept, great food quality, and the guys/girls in the back are so nice, professional ,  polite, and deserve a raise for what they do! Put one of them in the window, they are so polite and customer service oriented. The current girl in the window needs to go!"}
{"text":"POSER ALERT! These 'bertos bite so hard, they even have almost the same logo as Filibertos. It fooled me...I swooped in for a lard infused breakfast burrito to feed my third chin. It wasn't good, which weirded me out because I thought I went through a Filly-Bs, and everything there is good. I looked at my cup, saw the rip off logo, and started sobbing. I had been taken! Like 'drop the soap in the shower in jail' taken. And who wouldn't cry if that happened? Anyways...this place is NOT Filly Bs, so don't go. Freaking POSERS."}
{"text":"They have $1 tacos Mon - Wed. Otherwise, I wouldn't go here. It's like the million other -berto's - very greasy, moderately priced and no customer service should be expected. When you need a late night/early morning snack or are just craving super greasy Mexican food, this is your place."}
{"text":"Basically, this place is the same as Filibertos.   In fact, I think the owner started as a Filibertos franchisee, then went indy.  Pretty much the same menu, and quality, which is to say better than Taco Hell.  it is somewhere between fast food and a full on sit down restaurant. This particular location is kept pretty clean and I like the carne asada nachos and burros, as well as the breakfast burros.  The only real complaint I have is the drive-thru speaker sucks, and the cramped turn and tight space you have to have to get through."}
{"text":"It pisses me off when I order a beef burrito for $7 I get almost all veggies and a minute hint of beef. This is second time they've done this. Had I opened it up in the parking lot before I got home, I would have gone back in, opened it up and asked, \"Where's the beef????!!!!\" After the first time, I went inside to order and complained, so my burrito then actually had beef in it. I was too tired and hungry after delivering food all night to remember to say something. Should have taken a photo of the veggie burrito to show them."}
{"text":"Horrible place! Me and my family ordered 3 Carne asada fries, Carne asada burrito, and super nachos.   All of our meat was burnt! It was black and crispy even the chips were burnt! They used to be good I don't know what happened, this is the last time we get food from this place..we spent too much money for burnt food!"}
{"text":"Look, this is not gourmet Mexican. However, for fast food Mexican, this place is great. The food is always hot, not too greasy, and tasty. 

Their breakfast burritos are HUGE. 2 can easily share and are less than $5 bucks each! They do not skimp on the meat either. The egg & bacon burrito was practically loaded with a full pig.

Also,if you are into hard shell tacos, they can make any taco into hardshell. The carnitas hardshell taco is my favorite"}
{"text":"If you're in the area and want a quick fix from south of the border, you won't be disappointed.

These guys used to be at the Filiberto's near 32nd st and Indian School until about two or three years ago. I remember going inside that location at one point and they were passing out flyers and said to start going to Juliobertos as soon as it opened up.

Since I lived just up the street and the dudes were always cool, I gave Julioberto's a shot and was not disappointed.

I always place my order inside, as the inside is open 24 hours as well, not just the drive thru. If you go inside they have a Salsa Bar with several different types of Salsa's, one of them being an Avacado Salsa, which is top notch in my opinion. They also offer pickled carrots, onions, and jalapenos at the salsa bar.

Everything that I have yet to try has been consistently good for this type of establishment. The carne asada burrito always seems to be a classic among the white boys like myself, and I must say that I have yet to encounter a burrito that contained fatty meat or a dried out tortilla. The meat has always been seasoned well with all of the condiments inside and the tortilla was fresh and hot. The red salsa and the avocado salsa combined on this burrito or any other adds so much flavor.

The five rolled tacos with cheese, guacamole, and sour cream are always a great late night snack when you're on a diet...I highly recommend..lol ;)

The machaca beef and eggs wasn't bad, nor was the chorizo and egg burrito.

They seem to keep the salsa bar area well stocked and clean, as people make constant messes at those things, but they always seem to be on top of it.

The staff has always been friendly, and the overall experiences have always been consistent.

I highly recommend this place if you are in the area and can't decide which Mexican Fast Food joint to grab your meal from.

Cheers! :)"}
{"text":"Julioberto's is a good place to grab a bite to eat. The cashier provided outstanding customer service and is very professional. The employee is very passionate about her job. The restaurant is very clean. Thank you for a pleasant dining experience."}
{"text":"Ordered carne asada super nachos and could not believe my eyes when I got home and opened it up and saw what they sold as edible.  It absolutely looked like dog food!!! Absolutely nothing about these nachos made me want to take even a single bite.  The melted yellowish stuff on top of the nachos was supposed to be cheese but I'm certain it was not.  The meat piled on top did not look even remotely like carne asada but instead looked like what I feed my dog and the sour cream was curdled and absolutely disgusting.  I will never go back to this place again and will be calling the health department in the morning.  DO NOT EAT HERE, YOUR FAMILY WILL BECOME ILL.  100% disgusting !!! I had to rate this place with a star but I DO NOT believe it even deserves 1 star."}
{"text":"This is our favorite late dinner restaurant in Buckeye. Their carnitas burrito is delicious... lots of juicy soft meat in it. The rolled tacos with guacamole are my daughter's favorite and their carne asada fries are so good alot of meat and dont have all that grease at the bottom of the plate like most places do. 
The drive through girl is always nice and gives us alot of salsa.  Cant complain about anything at all."}
{"text":"This is supposed to be a hard shell beef taco. Really? I barely see any beef, lots of lettuce, a bit of cheese and a lot of tortilla. A sad taco really. 2 \"beef\" tacos rice & beans & soda for about $7.49. It should be called beans & rice with hard shell tortillas and maybe beef inside \"if you're lucky\", so GOOD LUCK! (See my pic)"}
{"text":"Had the carne asada burrito and it was huge and delicious. Extra tasty with the red and green hot sauce. And it's open 24 hours!"}
{"text":"Came to satisfy a late night craving and was very disappointed. It was completely empty, yet I still waited about 15 minutes.  I ordered a breakfast burrito with bacon, egg and extra cheese. The tortilla was not even browned and seemed raw. The bacon was burnt causing the whole thing to taste burnt. Of course they forgot my extra cheese. 

I also got a lemonade that was warm and gross because they don't use filtered water and hardly put any ice in it. I'm pretty upset I wasted $10 and still went to bed hungry and thirsty. It's really a hit or miss with these types of 24-hour restaurants. I'm new to the area so I didn't know any better, but I'll stick to Filiberto's or Denny's (LOL)."}
{"text":"Mexican fast food... being from New York and then Miami this was pretty new to me (outside of taco bell, which brings great shame to the term \"mexican\" or \"border\"). So at about 2 a.m. with some large amounts of alcohol in my system, I decided to try it. The tacos were pretty good, especially at that point in the evening. Food was fast as the name would suggest, and cant beat it for a late night meal."}
{"text":"I've been here three times, and the first two were amazing. The Grand Canyon burrito was BOMB.. my 3rd time, I get to work (starving hadn't eaten all day) take my burrito out of the bag, lay it on the desk, it flips open and guess what I see! A little curly hair, WRAPPED IN MY BURRITO. I don't believe this was a mistake, and I don't appreciate them not offering to fix the issue. I have to find another burrito place now. WEAR HAIR NETS"}
{"text":"Was in Phoenix and decided to stop off at Filiberto for a quick lunch before I had to catch a flight home. 

I would best describe Filiberto's as a fast food joint a set up from Taco Bell. Basically it's a fast food joint with lots of mexican fast food items such as Burritos, Tacos, and Tortas. Prices here are a bit more than you would expect from a fast food joint and you're looking around $4 - $8 depending upon what you order. 

I decided to go with the Carne Asada Tortas Combo. I was hoping to be in an out but the food took a long time to cook. I probably waited about 10 minutes before the food came out. The Tortas was a good size and was a mix of good and bad. The Carne Asada had good flavoring but was tough and the guacamole while good was layered on there thick. It was to the point where I got a guacamole torta with some carne asada topping to it. The fries here - well frozen Costco fries. 

As to ratings, Filiberto is ok. It fills a need and nothing more. Overall you can do better but if in a jam and looking for someplace, will work. 3 Star rating for Filiberto's."}
{"text":"The place I go when I'm craving a bean and cheese burro.  Nothing more, nothing less.  Good stuff!"}
{"text":"Waaaaah! Mine burned down in my area on Bethany Home & I-17. So authentic they had illegal aliens working there and where else ya gonna go at 3am when you're drunk? The pictures on the outside menu helped because you can just grunt and point in any language. But it's gone. WAAAAHH!!  See my video on YOUTUBE on it. The Vanilla Godzilla."}
{"text":"It may be because I'm from California but this was one of the worst mexican food places I've ever been to. The refried beans lacked flavor. The rice was borderline salty. The burrito was 90% veggies and 10% meat. The burrito was super loose and wrapped all weird and was way too much tortilla for the amount of filling there was. The guy wrung us up for an extra fish taco meal. But only gave us what we actually wanted. So we had to go back up to get our money refunded. He was understanding and apologetic. Which was really nice of him to acknowledge he made a mistake. Overall we will probably not be returning in the future. On the bright side the portions were large, however the enchilada was just tortilla with cheese with and canned sauce. But the cheese was not melted at all."}
{"text":"By far the best 'bertos location in this part of phoenix. I go out of my way to drive a little farther to this one, with at least a couple closer to me. Chile relleno burrito is really good, so is their veggie burrito. They also have 1.19 beans (only) burritos that are really big. Sometimes that hits the spot all on its own, and sometimes I get it to go, open it up at home and add my own cheese. That's like a 1.50 for a totally filling meal.
Their taco salads (which are on special on Mondays for like 5.49 incl. a can of soda) are disgustingly good. Those and the carne asada fries- eat with caution for your waistline's sake."}
{"text":"Red chicken burritos were fantastic. Fresh tortilla. No wait in the drive through. Friendly service. Good price."}
{"text":"Breakfast burrito.  Made to order so was a bit concerned, but burrito tasted great after the drice to office.  Will be back again."}
{"text":"I lost faith in this place for awhile as one cashier clearly does not like white people but tonight the general manager told us that he had watched the tapes and he apologized and was a very nice guy. And the new cook is AWESOME!!!!! I LOVE THIS PLACE AGAIN!! The GM is nice and does want to keep his customers!!"}
{"text":"Love it! Great specials, love .99 cent tacos Mon-Wed. You can not get a side of beans smaller than a pint though which is ridiculous to turn down more money from customers for a half pint. But I come back at least twice a week! Love the super nachos, fries, tostadas have yet to try the chorizo though. Drinks are ok, they come from powder so I opt for the soda."}
{"text":"Never again! I specifically ask for street tacos. I got 4 HUGE tacos with no flavor and loaded with water down guac! The Horchata was (is) HORRIBLE taste like, soured milk. First and LAST time. What a waste of $13.00 BTW I give it NO star I accidentally pressed the start and I can't take it back :("}
{"text":"I went through the drive-thru expecting a similar experience to other \"berto\" establishments and was extremely disappointed with my experience here. The girl kept cutting me off, asking if that was all. You would think after my second \"no\" she would quit telling me to drive to the window. 

When I got my food inside my home 15 minutes later, the guacamole had already turned black and the retried beans looked like they'd been scraped off the bottom of the pan. The lettuce was wilted and the grated cheese inside the enchiladas was still cool and had never melted. 

Yuck If this is what I *could* see, I fear what I could not see. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"I went through the drive thru and it was kind of slow for the fact that there was no cars behind me. Customer services was ok. The food was good. I order some carne asada fries and only received 2 small salsas one green and one red. Over all not bad at all."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good here and made fresh.  I stated coming to this location when the one off Bethany Home Road burn down.. this staff is pretty cool and nice"}
{"text":"This probably my favorite worst restaurant I have been to. They do not take care of their customers requests and they do not take into appreciation that some people don't like certain things. I highly suggest they take orders in the future."}
{"text":"There is nothing like your local ___berto's. Nothing.

Breakfast. Lunch. Dinner. 4th meal. 10th meal. Julioberto's is always the answer."}
{"text":"Love that this location has potato tacos!! And you have to try the manzanas de chamoy!!! Perfectly fresh apple, tart, sweet, and salty! Delicious! This is the best location!"}
{"text":"Julioberto's epitomizes cheaply priced, but well made, \"fast\" food.

The green chile burrito is less than $4, but it's almost as big as my forearm. And tastes AMAZING!

I go here every few weeks, and that's pretty much my standard menu order.

That, and the Quesadilla California, which is $2.99 for a large serving.

They take credit/debit at the drive-thru, which is a big deal for me.

If you haven't been, you definitely NEED to go!

But don't worry about breaking the bank, as you can feed the family for around $20."}
{"text":"Free WiFi. Carneasada flavor was good but taste boil not grilled . service was OK. The salsa was watery. Lots of good combos"}
{"text":"This place rocks. 

Anything that comes out of the kitchen in this place is sheer magic. Bean and cheese burrito? DELICIOUS. Rolled tacos with guacamole? OUTSTANDING. 

They probably dislike me because I usually roll up in a taxi with my roommate and we're white girl wasted, but oh well."}
{"text":"Always good take-away Mexican food!  

We come here all the time and on this particular visit I got a grilled shrimp salad with avocados, onions, tomatoes, lettuce and bell peppers.  My husband got a huge bean and cheese burrito and our young daughter got the carne asada fries; crisp french fries smothered in delicious carne asada, cheddar cheese, guacamole and sour cream.  (Shhh...don't tell anyone, the carne asada fries were really for mommy, that healthy salad was just a ruse..)

Everything was hot and delicious, as usual.  We love this place!"}
{"text":"This place is SOO SLOOWWWW !! the drive thru always takes FOREVEERRR at the speaker and picking up the food. They don't give much salsa. I wish Taco Bell was still there... Very unsatisfied"}
{"text":"I always like to eat at this place... It's cheap and it's fast and their carne asada burritos are very good. It's very dumb P inside and not very nice and the bathroom smells bad. Other than that it's a really cool place to eat"}
{"text":"Menu is extensive, self serve salsa bar. Really clean.  If you have questions be patient while the cashier gets the manager that speaks English.  He's super friendly and will make whatever you want.  

Oh how I love a good machaca breakfast burrito and horchata.  I told him to hold the cheese and veg it up.  It was huge and perfection.  

Yumm."}
{"text":"Honestly it isnt 5 star quality, its prolly 4 -4 & 1/2.  But I gave it 5 for consistency, no matter what time it is or who's cooking.  Great burrito at 2:25 in the morning, only $6?  Sign me up! Where?  Juliobertos 28th street and thomas, thats where.  They dont fuck around! Ask for it this way(in this order) and you'll never leave unhappy.

Steak burrito with white cheese beans rice and pico.  Fuckin delicious at anytime of day...  And you know its true cause they just started that loyalty card not too long ago that I mentioned in my first review.  Ive already had 2 free meals and damn near close to my third already.in about a month...

Only 2 places I really go out to eat anymore(with any regularity at least), here and 2 hippies gnarly burger joint on 40th st and thomas(cheesesteak and chicken sandwiches kick ass there!)  Why go anywhere else when they dont want to give back to those who keep them in business? Juliobertos is the perfect 24 hour place to fall back on when nothing else is open!"}
{"text":"Ordered a bean and cheese burrito at like 11:30pm. Sometimes you just gotta give in... and this time, there were no regrets. 

I did request rice to be in there, too, but I think the drive thru sound system is funky since she had a hard time hearing us... and I didn't get my rice, but it wasn't on my receipt either. Oh well. 

Pretty solid."}
{"text":"This place is now called Juliobertos, and I have found that this location has slightly spicier food, so it is my current favorite.  As with any Fill-In-The-Bertos, you have to know what to expect, and know what to order.  Here is a quick guide to a pleasant experience:

1.  What time is it?  If it is 2:40 a.m. and you spent the entire night at your favorite bar hitting on every girl there, but you are in the long Berto's line alone at 3 a.m., order whatever sounds good, and lots of it.  You aren't as attractive and smart as you thought you were when you were drunk, so you might as well go home, eat yourself into a stupor, and pass out watching infomercials.  These recommendations are for you, you fat tub of lard:

a.  Cheese quesadilla 
b.  Shredded beef tacos (minimum of 3)
c.  Rolled Tacos (one order to eat while you drive home)
d.  Any burrito on the menu

2.  It is dinnertime, you have had a long day, and your wife says bring home some Mexican food.  You are tired, and don't want to stop at a sit down restaurant and wait for the hostess to remember your food that is sitting in the kitchen.  You pull into Berto's drive thru.  There menu is huge, and a lot of their food is junk food, but there are a few gems on the menu:

a.  Can't go wrong with the burritos.  I personally love the chile relleno burrito, the carnitas burrito, and the carne asada burrito.  Get the green sauce with these.  I get a side of jalapenos with them too.

b.  Tacos: chicken or shredded beef-- Stay away from any Berto's fish tacos or seafood in general!  I've tried and tried, but have never had a good seafood anything here.   Get the red salsa with these.  Stay away from the rolled tacos too, they are not food.

c.  Never get a combo dinner plate.  The rice and beans are crap, the enchilada sauce is pathetic, and it is all going to leak out of the to-go box, through the bag and into your seat.  Stick with the burritos and tacos.


3.  What?  You still think this place is no good?  Your expectations are just silly, and your opinion is uninformed.  Fill-In-The-Bertos is a sacred temple to those who know  what they like.  If you are like me, and think onions are God's gift to food, you should like this place.  Stick with the above guidelines, and you too will be a satisfied customer!

Stay hungry my friends!"}
{"text":"This place is somewhat new in the hood... it's just like Filiberto's... same level of quality.  I have been here a few times and it seems thier chicken items (chicken burrito and chicken quesadilla) are better.  Either way it's gonna be a gut bomb so grab some tums and have fun."}
{"text":"The \"hood\" is a colloquialism not intended to imply \"ghetto\" or any particularly dangerous neighborhood. I am a proud resident of the Biltmore 'hood and my neighbors are retired Mormon doctors who all own corgis and drive Buicks and have umbrellas with \"Vanguard Investments\" emblazoned on them.

Anyway, even though the neighborhood isn't particularly risky it's dangerous just having this place so close to me. After a particularly harsh day at work I treated myself to the carne asada burro combo. Highly addictive, and there's probably enough fat in the tortilla alone -- never mind the filling -- to keep me and an African village or two going for a week or so. Nevertheless, it's delicious and a great antidote to an evening spent with too much single-malt and too many cigars and some women named Wanda and Clarissa. Those who know . . . . know . . . 

Anyway, go and enjoy."}
{"text":"Not fair. A co-worker turned me on to the carne asada burrito and I can't bring myself to order anything else here. 

Beef. Guacamole. Pico de Gallo. Wrapped in a flour tortilla. With green & red hot sauce on the side. Get the fock outta here."}
{"text":"I got a bean and cheese burrito. Simple wright. I guess their BEAN AND CHEESE BURRITO dosent come with cheese. Because they will charge you extra for nothing. Other then that the flavor was really good. I like there tortillas."}
{"text":"Being one of the million blank-oberto's in this town, this one is not all that bad.

I really don't like these places, but was at the bank across the street on a Saturday, had my 7 & 8 year olds with me running errands and it was getting to be around 1pm, needed lunch to be quick, easy and something they'd eat.

Between the three of us we had some pretty good quesadillas, a few tacos which were fully loaded and not 90% lettuce, and some carne asada.  

The food was all hot and the taco shells were really very good.   Was not asked to pay extra for the salsa bar OR for drink refills (even though the menu says there is a charge)

My only complaints are:
1.  How the reviewer concluded the food here is not greasy I will never understand..it was all greasy.  This is to be expected at this kind of place, but it was a bit over the top

2.  The blaring hispanic channel soap opera on the two tv's.  As much as I didn't want to eat inside we were a distance from home and I had no choice.  Again this is to be expected.

3.  60 cent charge to use my debit card?  On a $17 order?  Really??  Almost got them a 3-star for that one!"}
{"text":"I visit this location a few times a month and am always pleased. The staff is prompt and friendly and the food is great. Some of the food quality at other locations I have visited in the past were sometimes spot on, other times not so much. This location is consistent with the quality of the food I receive."}
{"text":"DAMN, Berto be popular! I thought he only existed in Cali.
If you are familiar with all of the ...'Berto's in the Sacramento area, then you know what I'm talking about - Fast food Mexican, that is leaps and bounds better than Taco Bell, Del Taco and whatnot. Perfect for those late night cravings. The flour tortillas are pretty damn good. I kinda got hooked on bean n cheese burritos and potato tacos. Maybe it was the late night, or vacation mindset... but, I love this 'Berto's much better than the all of the Sacramento Bertos."}
{"text":"I had the worst heartburn of my life from their nachos. The cheese was an odd consistency and the jalapeños were mushy not crunchy. Too much vinegar and not spicy. The meat was some sort of mystery Meat all ground up and glued onto the soggy chips then stuffed into a Styrofoam crate. Ugh. My husband did like the burrito."}
{"text":"Waited for forever in the drive thru to get a shredded beef burrito that ended up being so dry that the meat was crispy!! Definitely not as good as filiberto's"}
{"text":"Overall, it's a pretty decent place if you're really hungry for Mexican food. The prices are surprisingly low considering the amount of food you get per order. The cashiers are friendly and professional. But the condiment  area is almost always lacking in fresh items. 

This place is good if you want want good Mexican food and lots of it for a low price. But don't expect this location to have fresh condiments available."}
{"text":"This is a Julioberto's, another small chain. I'd always thought it was a Fillibertos but I don't read so good. They have a drive thru and a walk-up counter in the front.

The food is pretty average but it's open 24 hours, so I'd round up to 3 stars. Most of the other Mexican places along the I-17 close at midnight."}
{"text":"I bought a green chilli burrito and the meat in it, I swear, must have been a canned meat! I go back there once every 4-5 months to try something new, to see if I find anything good there, and I have not.  How disappointing
The green chili sauce and meat both tasted blah."}
{"text":"Normally, I wouldn't bother to review a \"_bertos\". 
However, I stop in to this one about once a week and the food is consistent and the lady in the drive through is cheerful and has a great, sincere smile. 
But I'm actually writing because last Thursday night I had a gastronomic revelation.  I ordered rolled tacos with guacamole. No big deal, I order them often.  These were INCREDIBLE. Straight out of the fryer, crispy yet tender, screaming hot with perfectly chilled guacamole.  I pulled over and ate them in the car!  You don't know me, but I'm the one always yelling \"wait ' til we get home!\"
I've never tasted anything so yummy from a \"_bertos\"!!
P.S.
Avoid the beef tacos. For some reason, they're Nasty...on the other hand, the chicken is quite tasty!
I'm a fan and GOODBYE to all the other fast mexican food."}
{"text":"Let me first say that I generally adore Juliobertos.

This location is awful..
Here's today's example. I ordered a Pollo Asado burrito. Started eating it, and after two big bites, I'm like, \"This tastes bad.\"
It was beef.
I'm allergic to beef-thank GOD it's a mild allergy. How does Pollo Asado sound like Carne Asada? It doesn't. Plus, she even repeated it back to me.
Oh, and it wasn't good carne either...."}
{"text":"If by some bizarre circumstance, you ever find yourself unsure of what city you're currently in, the surefire way to identify if you're in Phoenix Arizona (besides the infamous dry heat) is that about every third major intersection, you'll find a drive-through Mexican restaurant of questionable quality with outdoor seating all with a single-word name ending with \"Berto's\".  You might see a Filiberto's, a Rigoberto's, a Humberto's...I'm sure if you looked long enough, you'd probably even come across a Bertoberto's somewhere!

Julioberto's, on the Northeast corner of 19th Avenue and Thunderbird, is one such eatery.  There are a couple notable things that set it apart.  Not only do they have indoor seating, but the indoor portion is the bulk of the space - there's just a few of the requisite outdoor tables available along the side of the restaurant.  Another major thing in its favor is that they're open 24 hours - both the indoor seating and the drive-through.

The food is generally better than those of its contemporaries.  I especially enjoy their rolled tacos with guacamole. their super nachos, and taco salads.  They have several combo plates all with the ubiquitous sides of rice and beans between six and nine dollars with a daily special each weekday at $4.99.

Still, there's no hiding that this is still essentially a \"dive\".  If you use the door facing Thunderbird, you'll notice a prominent crack across the bottom pane - that's been that way for years!  As long as I can remember, actually.  You definitely want to avoid using their restroom.  While the food is usually okay when you're in the mood for cheap Mex, you should nonetheless be advised to \"eat at your own risk\" since one time after eating here, I ended up with an extremely nasty case of food poisoning - the main reason I've ranked them only two stars."}
{"text":"Throughout the years I have been to a ton of the *berto restaurants, and for the most part they more or less the same.  Sure one place has a little bit better rice, or one has a better horchata, or whatever.  For the most part though they are all pretty similar.  This one, however, has been consistently better then the others I've been to.  

If you are looking for a good burrito, some tasty tacos, or my personal favorites the super nachos and the carne asada fries, this is definitely a place you shouldn't over look.  I can't speak any of the seafood dishes here (I just can't muster up the courage to try fish at a place like this) but pretty much every thing I've tried has been great.  Like I said the carne asada fries and the super nachos are both mine and my wife's favorites here.  The rolled tacos bring up a really close second though.  All the combos and platters are all pretty tasty too.

The next time you are in the mood for something a little bit greasy and unhealthy, this is a place you should check out."}
{"text":"Killing time after dropping off a movie at Blockbuster, I decided to find some place new to eat. As a rule of thumb, any of the ...berto's are best left for the end of a heavy night's drinking. But this was 11 a.m. on a Saturday morning and I was stone sober. With a bit of apprehension, I decided to give it a shot. Besides, I'd only my intestinal fortitude to challenge. 

After being impressed with their large, and vastly photo-depicted, menu, I opted to keep things simple with a breafast burrito. Bacon, eggs, potatoes and cheese. Nothing out of the box, conceptually. But what do you expect from a ...berto's? How about some of the freshest tasting eggs, strikingly flavorful bacon and a tortilla that wakes up your taste buds? Yeah, it was rather surprising. And I didn't experience those post-berto's blues anytime afterwards. So, I'll be making it back here."}
{"text":"I live right down the street from Julio's. I have been eating here for all most 3 years, and have been disappointed only once. Other than that though, the food is great for being \"fast-food\". I especially love the walk-up counter. If it wasn't for that counter, I would have never tried this place. I mean, where else walking distance, can you find this? McDonald's and Subway don't allow dogs in their establishments, however, when you have a walk-up counter, that rule doesn't apply. Great for when I am walking my dog in the early mornings or late evenings."}
{"text":"I was surprised to see that this location was not yet on Yelp, however this address is not listed on their website either so maybe it is a separate franchise(?). Anywho, I am giving a 4 out of 5 stars for this type of restaurant, not necessarily a 4 out of 5 for all mexican dining. I like that Juliobertos offers a \"light\" menu and wheat tortillas although I am not sure just how light these choices are. Also it seems to depend on who you order from but I have noticed that some of the staff do not know what is what when it comes to the menu. I have ordered the grilled chicken burrito off the light menu and received grilled breast one time, grilled thigh another time and shredded chicken one other time. Either way everything typically tastes great, I like that there is a salsa bar inside and the food overall is a great value as is with most 'bertos restaurants. Plus after a late night of drinking who can beat a $5 meal of carne asada fries?!!!"}
{"text":"Going through the drive thru to get a Chorizo Burrito to be non eventful, ordered at the menu, then waited at the window and then when they came to the window he said what was your order again. After waiting for a little more than expected, he popped his head out and said sorry it is taking so long what would you like to drink on the house, so he gave me a large Pepsi and all this time he was pretty nice about everything. 

I finally get the Chorizo Burrito and it is pretty good, a little on the spicy side but not overly hot.

First time I went ti this location and it is not to far from home"}
{"text":"After partying, I normally get a burrito from filaburtos but since one wasn't around, I had to settle for this place. Didn't care for the burrito that much. It didn't taste decent ... But the salsa was really good so three stars for that. Oh and the prices are more than filaburtos."}
{"text":"Their Chicken Taco is pretty good for a $1 on Monday and Tuesday!"}
{"text":"Stopped by early this morning for a breakfast burrito and a churro. Everything was going fine til I got to the window to pay. Not only did a bum come up to my car and peek his head in asking for money, the lady working there knew about it and didn't seem to mind. It's just not a good look. I hand the lady my debit card and after three or four minutes, she tells me my card isn't good kinda rudely. Oh well,  I drive down the street and use the card no trouble to get gas and a drink at QT,oh and I got cash back with no trouble. Point of the story is their machine is fucked up and she said it was my card, which it clearly wasn't. Get your machine fixed and don't let homeless people walk up to the cars to panhandle. I came for food, not to have someone who made poor life decisions ask me for money."}
{"text":"Reasonably priced burrito compared to Filibertos. 

Get the California burrito. Super tasty. Open all day.

The Cali Bureet is a carne asada based burrito with french fries in it. Super tasty and an excellent value."}
