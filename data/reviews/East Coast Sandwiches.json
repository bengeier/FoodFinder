{"text":"Ordered their burger special at lunch. Came with big order of good fries, burger was decent. Noticed special sign said 1/2 pound burger, main menu said 1/3 pound. Which is it? Had to wait easily a half hour to get order!  Wasn't even all that busy.   Friend ordered Lenten fish sandwich. Big fish, nothing on it or offered. Fish was so over fried it couldn't even be bitten through.  These folks rely on their lunch business, yet don't have the system or staff to handle the orders. Saw people leaving without even ordering. Hope they get their act together, but it's been a while since they opened."}
{"text":"Big Sandwiches...  I found this place by accident.  They were new and working out some supply issues.  They were out of some of their sandwiches at the time.  The sandwich I had was good.  I wanted the Italian Roast Beef Sandwich but settled for the meatball.     I had a fountain Iced Tea -  which was okay but it would be better if they made Ice Tea onsite.    Overall - it is average but I will go back and try it again and do another review."}
{"text":"Best hamburgers and fresh cut fries in the area. Friendly staff too."}
{"text":"Cold soup x4 Raw turkey burger 2 young kids running the place and my turkey Rachel continued the trend.....cold and after sending it back came w cold bread.   Wow bad choice for lunch."}
{"text":"If I could give it negative stars, I would. How the heck this place is still open is beyond me. The restaurant itself I believe used to be a retail store, and they didn't do much to change the layout. It's very cavernous, and it looks like the furniture was all either taken from various rooms in someone's house, or purchased a yard sale. Nothing is cohesive. Decorations on the wall are very weirdly arranged and old, and the food order area is very sloppy and disruptive to the flow of the restaurant.  I got a corned beef sandwich, and it was very poorly made. It looked like they cut the meat blindfolded and the bread was taken right out of the bag. It tasted even worse. I ate about half and then gave up. My fiance got a salad, and it had the same sloppy appearance as the sandwich, only it sounded like the taste was actually worse. The dressing tasted like Dimetapp, and the chicken on top looked like it had been boiled until it was halfway cooked. Just an embarrassing and awful display by these owners.  I almost feel bad writing this because I know it's difficult to start and run a restaurant, but this was one of the sloppiest, dingiest, worst places I have ever eaten in my life. There is a dearth of decent, non-chain lunch spots in Sewickley, but any hope you had for East Coast Sandwiches, forget about it."}
