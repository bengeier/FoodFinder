{"text":"Hands down the best!!! Wow, my son and I went here, and we got more than we expected!!! The best I ever eat!! You want be disappointed!!! I'm still thinking about it. I had the Yankee!  YUMMY"}
{"text":"My friends and I were passing through from out of town and wanted some good poutine. This place showed up on a list of good poutine places in the area, and for good reason. The service was excellent. The food was even better. I'm no poutine expert, and I only had the traditional poutine, but it was delicious. 10 out of 10, would recommend."}
{"text":"Didn't like the weird gravy....and there isn't any remotely healthy stuff to choose from. The appetizers ate good but this just wasn't real poutine to me . The staff and restaurant are nice but I don't think I will eat there again. .maybe food for a younger crowd."}
{"text":"The Mess Hall Poutinerie is an amazing sitdown/takeout Resturant. The Mess Hall has almost everything you can think of made into a Poutine. The restaurant has quite slow service but is worth it when you take a bite of the food. Overall if anyone goes past this place hungry, I suggest to go in and order something"}
{"text":"A vegan option too - everyone in our group was impressed. Mac and cheese wedges we're delicious, poutine too. Friendly service."}
{"text":"One word: disappointing.  The decor is adorable, staff has good vibes but the issue is the food.   As a long time vegan, I love finding and eating at every restaurant that offers vegan options So, I came here on my lunch break with some friends.   The parking lot has two spaces, but thankfully was empty when we went.   I ordered the vegan classic Poutine and my friends got the classic Poutine and the loaded Poutine.  Immediately I was turned off from the Poutine by the odd smell, I knew it wasn't the cheese because I'm very familiar with daiya cheese.   The fries were great but the issue was the gravy. It was very aromatic and smelt of fruit? Like berries?    Sure you could say 'it wasn't very good because it was vegan', if this was my first ever vegan gravy experience but it's far from it haha Even the packet vegan gravies taste better.   It was like running through a field of flowers with your mouth open.  That being said, my friend with the loaded potato Poutine enjoyed hers.   It's circumstantial, this was just my experience."}
{"text":"Delicious poutine. Friendly staff. Who says you need to go to Quebec for the best poutine?"}
{"text":"Sometimes life just calls for a big plate of artery clogging poutine. Not the drive through, imitation kind, but with real house cut fries and squeaky cheese curds. The Mess Hall serves up a decent version- original, vegetarian or vegan  along with local brews and artisan sodas served with frosted mason jars. The atmosphere is casual and friendly.    The menu is limited but perfect for those that that aren't in the mood for rabbit food. Perfect re-tox after hot yoga."}
{"text":"My go-to for my cheat day. Love the loaded potato poutine. I can never finish it though. The portion is huge. Can't wait to try their burgers. The owners are a lovely friendly couple who always chat with me when I come in."}
{"text":"So far the best poutine placed in Ontario I have ever tried with lots of varieties. A little disappointed with the portion served in the to go large box... We ordered Yankee which has okay pieces chicken breast with Buffalo wing sauce. For a poutine, I didn't taste or see much of cheese curds and little blue cheese on top... Gravy portion was decent consider it was a little saltier than other sauce I tried. (Picture of our order posted) Overall, it was a good poutine place in georgetown.   The dining area is unique. I would certainly being friends next time they come visit georgetown."}
{"text":"Great place! Highly recommend. The absolute BEST onion rings I've ever had - delicious crispy batter. You can bite the onion ring without having a big slimy onion pull out. Fresh, delicious ingredients to make the burger and toppings. I love that it's a no waste place! Super friendly and welcoming service. It's just across the street from the park so bring a blanket and have a picnic. We'll definitely be back on a regular basis!"}
{"text":"Read the reviews and with friends in town, decided to make a visit (first time).  Ordered a veggie poutine and a pulled pork poutine.  The Good: Customer friendliess, fries freIymade fresh,   The Bad: Not enough poutine on the pulled pork poutine and cheese curds on both.  Doubt I'll visit again.  They need to learn from Smoke's."}
{"text":"A great place, I had the dirty bird and it was amazing. So good but no fountain drink so cans and bottles only"}
{"text":"This is honestly some of the greatest poutine I've ever had. Had the Yankee 2.0. Great service and amazing food."}
{"text":"Me and the wife had a fine quick meal here  Nice burger with homemade patty  Good chicken sandwich. Solid.   Nice craft beer including frosted glasses   Oddly enough weakest part was the poutine   Still, I liked it"}
{"text":"This place is so yummy! I'd like to consider myself a poutine connoisseur and this place by far is the best I've had. The place is set up so cute and the staff is so warm and welcoming!"}
{"text":"So flipping good!  We ordered a bunch of food to take home and, in my opinion, there were no missteps at all.  The restaurant itself was very cool, with great ambiance. It's somewhere I'd certainly enjoy hanging out to eat. However, we were here for carryout...  Many times, fried things don't travel well. This was certainly an exception, though.  The fried pickles retained their crunch and the mac & cheese bites were hot, crispy, and creamy with great flavour (It's a Canadian restaurant, eh?).  However, let's face it -- you go to a poutinerie for poutine, right?  Well, I was not disappointed. Not one bit. The fries retained a bit of their crispiness under a blanket of gravy. The gravy had a slight sour flavour to it, as though vinegar was a component. It wasn't off-putting to me; instead it brought an extra level of flavour I enjoyed. The cheese curds had gone all melty in places and there a few which were still squeaky - perfection! The only problem was there was so much food! Ended up not finishing it all.  Looking forward to the next time!"}
{"text":"This is probably the best poutine I've had in my life. I saw this place on you gotta eat here and had to try it. I got the Yankee 2.0 which is the buffalo chicken, bacon buttermilk ranch, green onions over a traditional poutine. Portion was very big I loved it. I'm still thinking about this place."}
{"text":"I have had poutine from all over Canada and The Mess Hall is by far the best I have ever had.  The staff are top notch and service is quick.  The Yankee 2.0, & The Dirty Bird hands down most enjoyable poutines I have ever had in my LIFE.  Price are fair, the are completely green, fresh cut fries and the support local farms of the area.  If you love poutine its worth the drive to Georgetown Ontario, you gotta eat here did.."}
{"text":"Its always great hearing about a place that is totally off my food radar in my area.  I was told about this great little place in Georgetown called the \"Mess Hall Poutinerie.  If there is one thing that I love as much as a great burger...its a great poutine!!  In the last couple of years Poutinerie's have been opening up and serving crazy combinations of toppings (pulled pork, bacon, sour cream, chicken) on top of the traditional french fries, cheese curds and gravy.  Some of these Poutineries know the basics and blend new flavors well and some just get it all wrong.  The Mess Hall Poutinerie is one of those great places that you just want to tell everyone about.  Fresh cut fries, homemade gravy, Quebec cheese curds..the basics...check!!  Now the craziness begins...My first visit here I tried the most popular poutine on the menu ...\"The Dirty Bird\" ($11.50) Fried chicken, Bacon, Crispy Onion and deep fried pickles.  The crispy bits of chicken and bacon provided a savory flavor along with the snap of the crispy onions made this poutine...Awesome...I didn't eat the pickles, but my wife sure loved it! On Saturdays the feature \"The Cure\" All Day Breakfast Poutine. One egg over easy, house-made maple bacon, fresh hollandaise sauce, roasted tomato & crispy onion on a signature classic poutine.  This is for your recovery from being hungover from Friday.  The menu and rotating selection of poutine's are amazing.  BTW they also have the biggest onion rings(Small $6 Lg $9) I have ever seen!! A great crispy batter and great portion size is also a must try!  This is an owners run establishment and they are very friendly and welcoming.  The only downside is the parking..pretty limited in the front of the store, but there seems to be some in the back.  If your ever hankering for a Poutine..and not just the same ol poutine from the chain restaurants...make your way to G-Town and give the Mess Hall your a try..because a good poutine is hard to find!!"}
{"text":"Took the drive out to Georgetown as we heard great things about The Mess Hall. We were not disappointed! Tried both the Yankee 2.0 and the Donair special. Very large servings - could hardly finish them! One of the largest poutine's I've ever ate.  Friendly staff and a nice outdoor patio to enjoy your meal as well. We will be back."}
{"text":"Expected mediocrity and found myself pleasantly surprised.   Dirty bird poutine. Must."}
{"text":"I absolute LOVED this place. The portion sizes are great and the toppings were enough for the poutine. It was delicious. My only suggestion is to ask for no or little salt on the fries. Mines were a little too salty but that would be my only critique. I can't wait to go back and try something different. The staff were also very friendly and helpful. It may be pricy for some but it's a large portion and totally worth it!"}
{"text":"You gotta try the New Donair poutine and the Loaded Potato poutine. The meat on the donair poutine was so good it had me almost begging for them to teach me how to make it. The loaded potato poutine take an already amazing poutine and tops it with your fvourite baked potato toppings, get the pulled pork added to it to really make it exceptional ($). The staff are friendly and knowledgeable about the menu and make great suggestions. The portions are huge and you will not leave hungry. It was nice to see the staff coming out of the back of the restaurant to check on the customers and make sure they were happy. The minimizing of waste is also something to be proud of. If you haven't already checked out this Georgetown staple after seeing them on \"You gotta eat here\" you should go right now! Keep it up guys!"}
{"text":"Best poutine ive ever tried.. Hands down!!!!!!! Good customer service as well.. Will def. recommend to other people"}
{"text":"I consider myself a poutine connoisseur if you will and am always seeking out the best places for poutine. This one is on my top 5 for sure! Amazing food and friendly staff! I recommend it to everyone I know! I always order the pulled pork one and my boyfriend has had almost everyone on the menu. No complaints. Always leave satisfied and happy!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for about 2 years now. Tried the yankee 2.0 the first time. It was so good that I'm too afraid to try any other poutine. It's my go-to. Why mess with a great thing? It's pretty much a take on a buffalo chicken ranch poutine. It's easily the best version of any buffalo chicken poutine I've had. The buttermilk ranch sauce takes it to a new level. Good amount of buffalo chicken in there too. You can't go wrong with this one."}
