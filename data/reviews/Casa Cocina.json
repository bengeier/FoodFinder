{"text":"The food was very very good. The service could have been better. It was a little on the slow side getting us in and seating us. Once seated we waited for our waitress, name was Nicki and she was terrific!"}
{"text":"Is the worst Mexican food I've ever had in my life. We ordered the Carnitas and Taquitos they were burnt and dry and you could not cut into them. I recommend you don't order anything pork. No one really eats any pork out of that restaurant. It was a scary experience. My husband had the taquitos, he said it was good but the chicken was so hard at the end that he could not possibly chew the chicken. The rice was Rice-a-Roni style.  The napkins smelt like mildew. The food just altogether seemed like it was pre-made, terrible food that had been sitting in a walk-in refrigerator for four days. Coming from Southern California I have never seen a Carnitas plate look like that in my life. They did comp us for the burnt carnitas. Waiter was terrible but the hostess was beyond great! Chips were terrific!"}
{"text":"I usually take pictures to post with my review but it wasn't worth the battery life. Our server was Matthew. He made us feel like he was annoyed by us. The food was unimpressive. I had a taco salad. My boyfriend had the fajitas. Both were bland and sloppy. Afterwards we went to the bar for their \"Happy Hour\". The bartender was talking to either her boyfriend or husband or maybe he was a regular. Either way she was inattentive. I definitely won't be going back there. I don't feel like this was a bad day. I think it's more the norm."}
{"text":"Let me say first that I have been to this restaurant before and am not going off one time only experience.  With that being said, I would rather have spent my money at Roberto's then Casa Cocina.   To start the meal, it took the hostess a good fifteen minutes to get us a seat in the not busy restaurant.  From there we sat at our table for 20 minutes before the waiter meandered over to take our drink order.  Before we had our order taken however my friend and I overheard a conversation between two waiters to the affect of \"I don't want to have to serve them.\"  Being that we were the only people in the area at the time and the same waiter ended up serving us, there is only one logically table they could have been talking about.   The food itself arrived on time and was well prepared.  During that time we noticed that the hostess was at the table next to us flirting with the men sitting there and all the while there was a line piling up at the front of the restaurant.  It took another employee telling her that people were waiting for her to start doing her job.   As the meal drove to a close and we waited for the waiter to reappear from the netherland he had disappeared to, my friend and I became impatient and asked the passing hostess for the check.  She apologetically went to fetch it while out of nowhere our waiter reappeared and asked if she was getting us the check.  We responded with a polite yes and he said \"I'll be back in a few minutes to cash that for you.\"  We waiting for about ten minutes before we went up to the hostess to cash the check and leave no tip. I realize that this accounting is not necessarily a reflection of the restaurant as a whole but I can say without a doubt that it did not seem like any of the other employees were very polite either. We were seated near the kitchen and heard a large amount of grumbling and complaining.  I also realize that very few people love there jobs enough not to complain about them, but they should have had common sense and decency not to do it were your patrons can hear.  Needless to say, I will NOT being going back to Casa Cocina again."}
{"text":"This was for sure the worst by far. The rice entered your mounth an with in seconds the first thing to come to mind was dirty sock. you know the smell only this time it felt like those socks were in your mouth. After trying to eat the enchilladas it was so dry and flavorless that I didnd eat them. My wife had fajitas and they were actually pretty good. The cashier asked us how things went and we let her have it. The bad thing was she admitted that the rice was horible and the food was not athentic. The server was great but the food definatly got 2 thumbs down."}
{"text":"I love this place first time here. On the Border you have something to learn we had fajitas and they were a lot better then on the border. Their chips come with 3 different dips.  Service was extremely fast and the Margaritas were excellent. As far as the fajitas go it was enough to split between the two of us.  Price is very reasonable for what you get and best of all you're right inside the casino.  Will definitely come back and I might as well say goodbye to On the Border"}
{"text":"I'm not a picky person. But when I go out for a meal, I'd like the service to be, at the very least, above average. The waiter looked absolutely miserable. We ordered guacamole, which they prepare at the table. I was staring at him, thinking, \"This dude does not want to be here.\" Part of me wanted to ask him if he was OK, because I thought something must be wrong. He was preparing it with this frown, behaving as if he was looking at his entire family laying dead inside the bowl. Seriously, if that's the way you approach your job, and you're in the hospitality industry, you need to find a new line of work. Perhaps it was an off day. Either way, it set the wrong tone for the meal. The minute we finished eating our main course, he brought the check. We weren't even asked if we wanted dessert. And when we ordered dessert, he gave me this weird look. Again, I'm not a picky person, but this waiter seriously cast a black cloud over our dinner.  Food was average. On par with Chili's. Nothing special. If you're in the Cannery and want Mexican, it will suffice. But don't go out of your way.   When I add it all up, all I can give this place is a 3. Average food. Below average service. But not terrible terrible. Most others would have likely given them a 2 or a 1."}
{"text":"I bring my boys here quite a bit. They love \"helping\" make the guacamole. They tell Chrissie what to put in and how much. She's always a great sport. They like the bean dip. Good thing Cameron makes sure we have plenty. We love being greeted by Erica to start our dinner off right !! Great job everyone. I highly recommend this kid friendly affordable restaurant."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out after a friend recommended it. Out of four of us, none of us were impressed. The waitress was the only positive experience. The tacos were mediocre. The cheese enchiladas were tiny. The Chile relleno was extremely spicy when they are typically mild. They use cheddar mix blend of cheese rather than authentic Mexican cheese. Overall was just not impressed."}
{"text":"Food is acceptable, service is acceptable. Located in the middle of a busy street, but it's possible to find a decent parking spot. The wait was not so bad, the cheese enchiladas were not up to its standards but we might return."}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out since we had a good experience at the steak house next door.  They brought us chips, 2 salsas and a bean dip.  Chips tasted commercialized, salsa gave me the impression of store bought that was blended and the beans came from a can.  Maye they didn't but it tasted like it.  I ordered the Mole poblano and a bowl of tortilla soup.  First they brought me Albondigas (Mexican meatball soup).  I sent it back and they brought me tortilla soup.  It was FILLED with thin tortilla chip strips.  It wasn't bad, I would say 2.5 stars.  The chesse was one continuous glob at the bottom but the broth flavor was decent.  Then the main dishes came.  My mole was WAY too sweet and had no spice in it.  The rice was crumbly, beans too dry but the corn tortillas were as good as they come from a bag.  I didn't finish my whole meal (or the soup).  Wife ordered a side salad with ranch and it was average (ranch was good and salty which we like).  Her fajitas were ordered with no tomatoes but came with it.  She ordered a side of cheese and the waiter didn't bring it out.  They also did not include the Guacamole like they were supposed to.  The fajitas were okay, had decent flavor from the \"charring\" but could have used a little salt.  The veggies were way too oily for my liking.  Overall, food and service I will not be going back."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time even having lived right down the street. The bad reviews made me a bit nervous but we gave it a shot and it was great!  The food is good, the service is fast and friendly, and all in all it was a good experience.  Zuniga was our server; she is very friendly! Next time we come I will ask to be sat in her section again!"}
{"text":"Just stopped by for a quick drink before the movies ... Kimi the bartender was super friendly and got us exactly what we asked for !!! Quick easy and great service!!!"}
{"text":"I would honestly give this place zero stars if possible. Service was alright. I ordered a margarita and I swear there couldn't have been any tequila in it. It was super icy and full of syrup. I kid you not the whole glass was covered in sugar and it was a sticky mess. My boyfriend ordered two chicken enchiladas and said they were alright. I ordered a cheese enchilada and a chile relleno. I saw our plates sitting in the window for awhile but thankfully they still came out warm. Well my enchilada came out chicken not cheese. I sent it back and watched the cook roll his eyes when the waiter told him it was wrong. Ok so I get my food back 10 minutes later. My chile relleno was awful. It was just a wet battery mess. Not totally fried. No flavor. But mushy. I think I had one bit and couldn't eat anymore. This was easily the worst Mexican food I've had in Vegas. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Pretty good spot for Mexican. Food is good, prices are good, and it's really not too far out from where I'm at (Henderson/Green Valley area.) Compares pretty nicely against the food options at Sunset Station and some of the other \"nicer\" Henderson casinos, and the property itself is pretty legit. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"The chips were good,but is that saying much? I will give them kudos on their service,because they were very attentive. I ordered the carne asada burrito (and you know that's the thing I check for first usually if you are a Mexican establishment) with rice and beans. The burrito was average but the thing that didnt set well for me was their rice. It tasted like it was out the box.  This place has a long way to go to beat Vivo Michocan, Fausto's, Super Mex,etc..."}
{"text":"The food is always delicious. Basic Mexican fare- baked burritos and enchiladas. The bean dip is amaze balls. We come back for the food but the service is always sub par.  We eat here every 2 weeks and we either get the super slow non existent server or mr no personality that brings me an empty Tapatio bottle and insists they don't have Chalula even though I've had it there every other time."}
{"text":"Great to have such an excellent Mexican restaurant relatively near where I live.  The carne asada burrito was the best I've had in my 12 years in Las Vegas. The tortilla soup was excellent, and the service was attentive.  I just wish they didn't have such limited hours of operation."}
{"text":"My family and I have eaten here multiple times and we've never had bad service. The chips are great and taste close to home made. They come with a red and green salsa as well as bean dip. My margaritas are always filled to the rim. The food is americanized and isn't what you would expect at home but it is worth it. Our waitress Nikki was very quick and polite and very sociable. The price are great, and the mariachi band that plays make it an enjoyable cultural meal."}
{"text":"The absolute worst place I've ever had the misfortune of going to. We waited 15 minutes to be seated and then another 20 minutes before anyone came to take drink orders. We ordered drinks and food at the same time, waited another 15 minutes for the tea, an extra 10 minutes for some milk, and didn't get the margarita we ordered until we finished eating. When we finally got our food there was a long black hair just hanging out in the refried beans. We informed the waitress, who was disgusted, and took it back, then we watched them in the kitchen compare the hair to the people in there before coming to our table to inform us that it doesn't match anyone working in the kitchen. And then the manager said he would remake the plate. We had to remind the wait staff that we were missing part of our order (aside from the missing margarita). The food was bland and would have tasted better if I had cooked it myself. Overall one of the worst dining experiences of my life. Will definitely not be going back"}
{"text":"This is a great place to sit down and enjoy a Mexican meal.  Food is really really good, the manager D'Ann is really nice and always says hi.  I almost always get the Fajita's, its filling and good.  Only once they were a little shy with the chicken.  Great prices, great food and great service. A+."}
{"text":"My husband and I actually became physically ill after eating here, and the food was not good.  I lowered my expectations when the server came to the table and greeted us with \"Welcome to Olive Garden.\"  I never thought we would get sick though.  Their Mexican rice looked and tasted like yesterday's leftover fried rice from the local Chinese takeout joint.  It was not at all what I expected to be served at a Mexican restaurant.  The food was awful, as was the service.  It was not worth the hours of sickness we experienced after eating here."}
{"text":"I have eaten at lots of Mexican restaurant so I'm a pretty tough critic and this place was not that great.  I really was not that impressed. It's located inside the Cannery Casino so I'm sure it soaks up plenty of business from the people who are already there feeding slot machines their social security checks. I don't think I would go out of my way to walk through a smoky casino to eat here though. I find it funny that this place boasts \"Las Vegas Review Journal The Best of Las Vegas 2008\"... umm its 2011 that doesn't say much. I think the portions could have been better for the price. My girlfriend got fajitas and it was mostly vegetables. Overall our meal cost $29.17 before tip, I ate my whole meal and my girlfriend took home some vegetables.  I did like the chips and the two salsas and bean dip that came with it. If you're looking for an authentic Mexican restaurant go to VIVA ZAPATA'S it's just down the street on Craig and I-15 its way better."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a bite and drink before a movie. Waitress was very nice and the place was clean an inviting.  As for the food (combo platter), it wasn't that good.  Seemed like everything was either pre-packaged or frozen before serving.  I felt like I shouldn't have eaten it after I was done.  Maybe there's other things on the menu I should have tried instead."}
{"text":"To start I must say I am not a fan of mexican food.  With that being said, I really liked this place.  I took an out-of-town houseguest here because she likes mexican.  I was really impressed though.  They sat us right away and a drink runner/helper person came right away to bring us chips with three different dipping sauces.  The chips were extra salty, which I really enjoyed.  Our meals came with a cup of soup, a hearty helping of re-fried beans and an ample scoop of rice.  The shredded beef in my burrito seemed to melt in my mouth and the chicken in the taco was so juicy.  The whole plate came piping hot and smothered in a gooey mess of melted cheese.    They also have a promotion going on right now.  If you order two entrees or more, a host comes by to let you pick an envelope out of a basket.  Inside your envelope is a coupon for your next visit.  The only catch is you can't open it until you come back, so you won't know what you have won until you come back to eat there again.  I guess it doesn't matter, the food is so good I'd pay full price for it.  Don't try to come for lunch though, they are not open till about 4:30pm.  Plus they are closed Monday and Tuesday."}
{"text":"This is actually the worst Mexican food I have ever had. DON'T waste your time literally any Mexican restaurant is better that this. Every thing was bland. Their Mexican rice was hard and crunchy. Their enchiladas taste like tomato soup. Definitely would never recommend"}
{"text":"Happy hour is legit the margaritas are amaze and the menu selection is good quality for a great price I love to sit at the bar and just manifest on margaritas and good Mexican food wish it was open way later and more days of the week can't get enough"}
{"text":"The only thing that's good about this place is the hostess and margaritas. But not even a top shelf margarita could help this food. And the finishing touch was the waiter standing at our tea leaves telling us we had to pay now because the restaurant closed 5 minutes ago...lame."}
{"text":"I like the food here. It is good because they have a veggie been dip, so good. I have the tostada with the veggie beans and its good. Margaritas are good too."}
{"text":"We decided to grab some food before a concert we came to see at The Club.  We did not go in the restaurant, but sat at the bar outside instead.  It was happy hour so I ordered a Mango margarita for $5 and nachos for $5.  The mango drink was delicious....not too sweet, which is also a concern with fruit drinks. Didn't really taste the alcohol, which is fine, because I was just having it with my meal.  The nachos were ok. They didn't look like a lot on the plate, but they filled me up. I ordered a side of salsa, because I don't like the onions in the pico. I would give the nachos a 2 and the drink a 5....so overall I gave it a 3.  I would definitely return for the drinks.  The service was just ok."}
{"text":"We started off with Mango Margaritas, the obligatory salsas and chips and a delicious (complimentary) tortilla soup.  Our entrees were Red Snapper Coscina - sautéed red snapper filet with a zesty tomato and cilantro sauce accompanied by rice and homemade refried beans. A picture of our entrees may be found in Webster's Dictionary under the page heading \"Mediocre\". We concluded the meal by sharing a caramel flan that was too dense, but very tasty."}
{"text":"Very nice waiter, his name.. I dont remember! I think it was luis but im really not sure.. a young mexican man who used to life in new york as he told me.. very nice waiter! they didnt have cherry coke and he made me one handmade.. 5 stars for him... the food.. the quesadilla, cheese burrito, was really nice, real big plates!! the rice and vegetables, well the rice was too hard and the vegetables didnt really taste fresh.. so this was a bit disappointing.. my mom had a mixed plate.. it was suppose to be like an entrance, but it was so big it couldve passed easily as the mean dish... we took the food home in a doggybag, but this wasnt worth it... the next day we could throw it out because it was not nice anymore.. so this made me doubt about the freshness of the dish.. but overall.. for a weekly meal for nice rate it was a nice experience.."}
{"text":"Great service!!! 5 stars  Poor food reminds me of Taco Bell from 15 years ago when I used to eat there."}
{"text":"Service was attentive and food was decent, some say bland,as they must like a lot of salt and seasoning, which I like to add a little salt,not overdo  the seasoning, like most places I have been too. I got the shrimp fajitas and was amazed the huge shrimps I got, yummy... Lots of onions and some bell peppers, which I know come with it , but really do not partake.. The rice was a little stiff, not soft and fluffy.. And the chips with bean dip was yummy too, and change from the salsa mix... the extra star for service...."}
{"text":"Awesome bar right next to the Casa Cocina restaurant! It's a great find especially because the apps are half price until closing and there's a tv here to catch up on games while you enjoy your food! The bartender Shawn is friendly and very attentive as is his partner Daniel! The service is quick and the food is tasty!"}
{"text":"We like to try different places and this was a great choice. Salas, service, the food very good for the Mexican food."}
{"text":"We began this dinner with an excellent smooth mild Bean Dip, followed by good tableside guac.  But the Tortilla Chips were very salty.  Albondigas Soup was hearty and filling with very good, nicely formed meatballs.    I ordered 1 Ground Beef Taco and 1 Shredded Beef Taco  but received 2 Groud Beef Tacos.  They were very good tacos but Americanized crisp tacos deep-fried in metal slots.  Things were off on service this night.  Restaurant staff seemed so overwhelmed by the turnout that the chef himself brought out some of our completed dishes, and I had to ask three times for butter for my specially ordered Flour Tortillas.  My party of four dined on a Wednesday night, but apparently the Speedway crowd contributed to a full house in the early evening.  I will still frequent this establishment.  It is close to where I  often reside, and the food is consistent and sound, if not the service."}
