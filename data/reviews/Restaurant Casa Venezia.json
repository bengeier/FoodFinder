{"text":"I dropped in last July 2015 as I went to visit family in the area. The food was again very good. I had some poutine. You know the soggy mess with brown gravy and cheese curd?  I grew up in Quebec and left in 1975. Other that fries with gravy, I never knew any one to add cheese curds, or anything called poutine. It must have been something that was added the that French Fry and brown gravy thing after my departure from Le Belle Province . I decided to try it back when and liked it. Some do some don't. Each to their own.  Casa have great specials and make a stellar pizza. A stop off for good food, they care and I always gravitate to their eating establishment."}
{"text":"I've been going to the place for years. Decor is a bit out-dated, but it is clean. Servers are always nice. Food is always good. I wouldn't say that make great food, buut it is good.  The menu is typical \"everything\" menu, having pizza's, subs, chicken brochette's, pasta's, etc.  If you're in the are and want a good meal at a decent price, stop in here."}
{"text":"This place makes my favorite pizza on earth! The sauce is delicious with a hint of sweetness, they load the pie with tons of cheese, and the crust is what pizza crust should be, thin under the the toppings, but bulbous as the edges with little bits of char. I don't live nearby any longer, but I still compare all pizzas to this pizza, and none have ever come close. I also enjoy their poutine, which isn't traditional in the Quebecois sense, but has it's own Greek flair, with what I believe to be maybe nutmeg in their dark gravy.  Mmmm!"}
