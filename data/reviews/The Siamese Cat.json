{"text":"Tempe is incredibly lucky to have so many great Thai restaurants.  There are at least four within a mile or so of ASU.  Most are popular enough that you'll be waiting for a table on any given weekend around 7pm.

For some reason, Tempe's first Thai restaurant (according to the comment on their menu) is tucked away in an unpopular strip mall off the 101 next to a DES office.  My girlfriend and I stopped in without calling first on a Friday night and had the place almost to ourselves.  The tom ka gai was nicely spiced with lemongrass and lime leaves, and didn't have too much coconut milk.  Our green curry was spicy and had lots of fresh Thai basil.  For dessert we had a frighteningly tasty coconut custard dish with sweet sticky rice.

Siamese Cat isn't as posh, trendy, or expensive as a lot of other Thai places, but it's a great alternative to the crowds if you're looking for an exotic, romantic weekend dinner."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place.  It is often empty because it is tucked away in a somewhat inaccessible area, so we are the only ones in the restaurant.  The server is very nice.  The food is great, we love the vegetarian curries.  Some of the soups are really good."}
{"text":"This is definitely my new favorite restaurant!  The food was amazing.  I had spring rolls (Pau Pia), Panang, and Gaeng Kari.  They were all good.  The curries were not sugar-added Americanized Thai curries.  You can actually taste the spice and the ingredients.  I ordered medium spicy, and there was some heat to it, but I think I will try spicy hot next time.  Excellent service.  Can't wait to go back there to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Our go-to-style restaurant with my boyfriend is any Thai Food restaurant. We're suckers for a good Thai tea. ^_^

Anyways, there was a good Thai tea. Huge typical menu and moderately slow service like most. Are server was a kind smiley woman that checked in often. They deserve five stars simple because it was a quite hole in the wall place we expected . Delicious!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! If you want good, authentic Thai, this is the place to go.  It is located in an EMPTY parking lot so you would never know it was there unless someone told you about it. Their Tom Yum soup is absolutely amazing. Give it a try, you will NOT be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The best Thai food in the valley.  Small family run business, great food and awesome service.  When it gets busy it may take a little longer, but worth every minute."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate at the Siamese Cat for the first time last night. I am very disappointed in all the dishes we ordered.

When trying a new Thai restaurant for the first time, my husband I always get our favorite dishes. We ordered Laab Gai, chicken satay, phad kee Mao (drunken noodles) and phad bai kra prao. It's a lot of food but like most Asians, we like variety in our meal. 

The satay came out first and it was ok. Nothing memorable- you could taste a hint of the curry power but not much. The peanut sauce was super oily. 

Next was the Laab - I had high hopes for this because it usually is always good everywhere I go but this dish was much too salty.

The noodle dish was the worst dish. The noodles were really hard.  I could tell they did not warm up the noodles enough before cooking it. Also, there was no flavor to this dish at all. A big disappointment as phad kee Mao is always flavorful with the sauce and basil. 

Lastly the stirfry tasted nothing like what it should have tasted like. It was a typical stir fry and it was quite dry. 

Overall we phad 33 for everything so the food was cheap. The service is better than most Asian restaurants so we tipped our waitress well.  Sadly, we will not return because not one dish we ordered was anything near our expectations."}
{"text":"I loved this place.  It's kinda tough to find but right next door to the d.e.s. building.  Food was good and the price was even better.  For some reason the price is listed as $$ but this was least expensive thai resaurant I've been to in the valley...My girlfriend and I had dinner and thai tea for under $20.  Great atmoshphere, excellent service.  Will definitly go there again."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place the food is amazing and everyone that works there is very friendly."}
{"text":"This was not that great honestly..
Food was not as flavorful. I love Thai food I've had it in Cali and WA state. 
We ordered 27&28 gaeng keao wan & gaeng Kari 
The food had so lil flavor. It tasted old or something poorly made. 
Along with #8 combo appetizer 
Appetizers were awful this should have been their opening to getting you enticed with what \"good\" will come.  
Had dessert too coconut custard with rice. 
Not impressed.
Along with Thai tea this came to 23$ per person not worth it"}
{"text":"Ordered shrimp pad Thai for lunch cost me $10. It is fine if it's $10, if it is good. It wasn't. I read good reviews and was hoping to be completing a review with food stuffed in my mouth and belly full of shrimp and joy. Anyways- I opened my to-go box and found two itty bitty spring rolls and some sauce. The spring roll did not taste good at all so I ignored the second one. My pad Thai was dry :-(. I am lucky I asked for hot sauce to pour over. The shrimp wasn't cleaned out so I got to have a little task of cleaning the poop out of the shrimp before I ate it. That was fun.... I threw $10 into the trash. It wasn't enjoyable. That's sad because I like Thai food."}
{"text":"I've read a lot of the reviews and I have to say that some of them are pretty far-fetched.  This particular restaurant has been here forever, a day and  a half.  That says something in itself.  You don't stick around as a restaurant and give 'wierd' or poor service and expect to stay in business.  There is only one dish that I get from this place, but not because I don't like the other dishes.  It's the Curried Chicken.  I absolutely love curried chicken and this place has some of the BEST around.  I think people have a bit different feeling of the place because it is oriental type people, read: Asians, that are running the place.  Big deal and so what?  They are nice enough people, they are serving a good product and their prices are reasonable enough.  Go to some of the local Chinese restaurants and then I can start to talk about some weird, odd behavior from staff.  Admittedly, I haven't eaten anything but the curried chicken, so the rest of the menu I really can't comment on."}
{"text":"I first came here as a part of a class trip. We all enjoyed ourselves and feasted on the new and different cuisne that is Thai food. It was here that I first met and fell inlove with Pad Thai. 

It was so wonderfully prepared and delicious. I decided I needed to come back someday for more. And when that day finally came, I needed the navagator feature on my cell phone to get there! This place is really hard to find! so keep your eyes peeled and know that's in the depths of a strip mall. 

The pad thai was just as good as I remembered it. However, they did serve me bad shrimp. It even smelled bad! I didn't want to eat it. But I took it home to be polite. The deserts are good as well. The coconut ice cream topped with peanuts is surprising to say the least! 

I say, go! but take a map! Or a navagator if you have it. And be ready to be doted on, but don't expect any free refils on your soda! (boo!) and have a nice time with some nice people eating great authentic food. It was truely a great experience! :)"}
{"text":"Siamese Cat was, overall, very underwhelming. 

The food seemed to lack a lot of vibrancy of flavor. Everything tasted basically the same. Portions were average sized at best, though prices matched those of places I like a lot more such as Swaddee, Thai Basil, or Thai Elephant.

I got a noodle dish, a friend got vegetarian fried rice, another friend got the red curry, and my sister got yellow curry. The dishes were varied enough for us all to try a good selection from their menu. While the food was well-prepared and the place was clean, albeit small and in a strangely deserted strip mall, it just lacked the oomph we have come to associate with really good Thai food."}
{"text":"So so so so terrible.  The food was bland and tasteless, even for someone like me who literally asks for zero spice in Thai restaurants.  And one of my friends could not even finish her red curry entree, it was so horrible. Also, I got mildly sick after eating here, so please stay out!!!  This place was completely empty in the middle of lunch hour, so that says a lot."}
{"text":"This place was cute and the service was good. I just have to give it a poor rating because they managed to make my green curry taste watery. My guest and I both ordered our food mild (as opposed to hot), but not devoid of taste! It was a terrible disappointment because I really like green curry. I've just started ordering thai food mild but I've never had an issue like this at any other restaurant.

Their tom kha gai was also quite sour. This is the first place that I've ever had a sweet and sour tom kha (I thought that tom yum was the sweet and sour soup), but I guess there is a first for everything. I found the soup tolerable, but my guest wouldn't eat it. In any case, we wont be going back."}
{"text":"I stumbled across Siamese Cat shortly after moving to Tempe many years ago and it soon became one of my favorite places to eat.  It's a small restaurant run by a Thai family so you know the food is authentic.  The service is excellent (very fast, very friendly), the prices are low, and the food is fantastic.  I've tried nearly everything on the menu and have never been dissapointed.  I especially love the spring rolls (Pau Pia), anything with curry (especially the Curry Noodles), and the home made coconut ice cream.
I've brought lots of friends and family members with my over the years and every single one has loved it, even those who had no previous experience with Thai food.  I really can't recommend it enough."}
{"text":"So a coworker who doesn't even really eat Thai food recommended this place because some of her friends like it. \"Where is this place?\" I asked her. \"Right next to the AZ State Government Department of Economic Security!\" she told me. Umm. \"What's it called?\" I asked. \"The Siamese Cat\" she replied. So someone who doesn't know Thai food is asking me to come with her to a Thai place with a sketchy name in a sketchy area. What could possibly go wrong? So we wandered around the mall looking for the place because we entered closer to Baseline but it was in the northern corner. Mall is full of \"for lease\" signs - so much for economic security as far as this mall goes. The mall (or maybe the govt?) did shell out some dough for a number of solar panel roofs to provide shaded parking right by the Economic Security building. There's only a few other signs of life other than the Siamese Cat - Merry Maids and Tempe Bloopers. We walk in and there are a few tables occupied. We sit down right near the entrance. We were given soup with cabbage in it for starters. It was alright but a little bland. I ordered the Pad Prik Gaeng and ordered it spicy hot. When the food came I quickly realized that this was a more Americanized Thai food place where they pull their punches when they say \"hot\". The sauce was also really watery. It sort of reminded me of the time when our cafeteria at work tried to make a \"Thai dish\". Very bland. Too bad because the lady that served us was really nice. On the bright side, you get a lot of value. I had that and a thai iced coffee for under ten bucks. So if you're a value type person and are new to Thai food, this may just be your place. Your mileage may vary of course. Mine won't - won't be back."}
{"text":"One of my favorite lunch spots, I've frequented this location for years. 

The service is polite and personable. The food is fast and made to order. The prices are just right, especially the lunch specials. The facilities are older and nothing special, but I come for the food so I don't mind. 

Every dish I've had was very tasty, and I've never had a bad experience. Repeat customer!"}
{"text":"Wow had no idea this restaurant was their.  What a gem great service great food I took my friend and her husband and my wife for a birthday dinner. Everyone was totally satisfied..... thank you..."}
{"text":"This Thai food is absolutely the best we've ever had. The curry noodles are to DIE for and taste exactly like the food you find in Thailand. My husband lived in Thailand for several years and we've been back a couple times so trust me when I say this is authentic stuff! Mango sticky rice, beef salad, the curries and soups are all so good. And the service is excellent! The owners remember us every time and it's so fun to chat in Thai. Great atmosphere, wonderful food and all around great place. Best Thai food in Arizona!"}
{"text":"The spicy noodle dish was superb, some of the best Thai food I've ever had, almost licked the plate."}
{"text":"I really like the atmosphere, usually they have traditional Thai music played on a Khim which is very relaxing.  The decor and layout of the restaurant is also quite intimate.  Siamese Cat is run by a Thai couple, with the wife serving tables and the husband cooking.  The food is very tasty and reasonably priced.  My family has been coming here since the early 90's and it is still my favorite place."}
{"text":"It looks a little scary... okay, extremely scary, on the outside but this place is a diamond in the rough! The atmosphere is a little outdated and the smell... well, let's just say there is something funky going on there, but the food is absolutely delicious and the waitstaff is sweet and attentive. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"This place has some of the freshest tasting Thai food I have had. It is never too crowded and the service has always been great."}
{"text":"I came in here one night after having a huge craving for Thai soup.  I placed a phone order for immediate pick up.  While on the phone, the lady gave me details that I would have to drive deep into the complex.  I'm glad she told me that because I don't think I would have ever found it on my own.
I ordered a plate of Pad Thai for my boyfriend and a bowl of Tom Yum for myself.  Both dishes were great!  With the just the amount of spice (a level that you pick your own).
I don't know if this is a place where I would go sit down and eat.  The restaurant is a bit small and the decor was very outdated.  But, I've never been the type to stop eating somewhere just because the ambiance isn't the best.  I'm a huge fan of \"whole in the wall\" type places, just because they tend to have such great food!
But for now, I think I'll stick to to-go orders."}
{"text":"The yellow curry was broken. The pineapple rice tasted like regular fried rice could not taste the pineapple at all. It's an old restaurant and it looks like it. Would not eat here again if you paid me."}
{"text":"This place continues to go strong after so many years.  Still by far my favorite Thai place in all of Phoenix.  Perhaps, of any that I've ever tried anywhere.  Love it!!!"}
{"text":"I also feel misled by the very high reviews of this restaurant.  The service was very good.  The waitress (older lady) was one of the friendliest Asian ladies I have ever met.  (and my grandma is Japanese!!)

I have tried many, many of the area thai restaurants.  I LOVE thai food.

I ordered the eggplant dish with tofu.  The eggplant was okay, the sauce was yummy but there wasn't enough of it.  The tofu was DISGUSTING.  Seriously, I had to pick it out and not even eat it.  Ick!

I think Thai Elephant is the best still."}
{"text":"Gross. The noodles I'm sure were spaghetti. Beyond that, the food tasted awful. This place is horrible. Sad how places like this remain open and other great places close."}
{"text":"Decent food. Tiny, cute place. Right down the street from our house.  We weren't the biggest fans of the Pad Thai. Not bad, but we have had better, definitely. 

Lots of people ordered carry-out while we were there.  Maybe we just need to find the right items to order. :)"}
{"text":"The Siamese Cat was my very first Thai experience when I was about 8 years old, and I have to admit that at the time, I really didn't like it. Now that my palate has matured quite a bit, and the combined facts that I love Thai food and that this place is given some of the most consistently high ratings in the Phoenix area, I had to come back and give them their fair shake.

I came for lunch time because I'm poor and I noticed on their website that they have very affordable lunch specials, one of which is my all time favorite Gang Karee. Upon walking through the door, I was struck by the fact that almost nothing had changed in 15 years. I was seated promptly and soon thereafter placed my order.

While I waited for my food, another couple came in who clearly had a favorable report with the staff here. When they walked through the door, the server came immediately to them, welcomed them, and then realized that \"their table\" had yet to be wiped down from the previous customer. She quickly made the table available for them, and over the course of my meal I was struck by the rarity of this kind of familiarity between customers and staff in this KIND of place these days. They ordered their \"usuals\" and \"you know how I like the spice\". When the food was ordered, the customers had brought a holiday gift for the staff. I dont really know why Im writing about this, it just struck me that this place has THAT kind of clientele. Impressive.

Anyway, the food came out and I liked what I saw. The menu advertised lunch specials come with rice, eggroll, and soup du jour. The soup actually came out first, and it was a remarkably simple soup, but definitely not lacking in the flavor department. It was some sort of garlic/ginger broth with a few vegetables floating around...it was a nice way to start the meal. The main plate came out and I was immediately struck by a couple odd things: this was the first time I had ever seen gang karee (a curry) served on a plate rather than a bowl, and the \"eggroll\" was in fact two little tiny miniature eggrolls. They were cute, to be honest. Never really seen anyone make eggrolls like that, but they were good and tasty nonetheless.

The gang karee was fantastic. Very very good. Texture, flavor, doneness of the chicken, all just right. I did ask for the dish medium hot, and this was nowhere near that, but I didnt mind too much. The only thing I didnt like about the meal was the rice, which struck me as odd considering rice was probably the easiest thing to make on that plate. It just wasn't very good--it had a gritty texture, essentially flavorless, and there was too much of it as far as I was concerned. But hey, I didnt come here to eat rice, or at least not mainly to eat rice, so I only knock them slightly for this one.

Overall, my experience was very good. The service was fast and friendly, the food was flavorful and well presented, and it was nice to give this place a personal second chance and to finally learn what this place truly has to offer. I will certainly be back at some point in the near future."}
{"text":"We love the cat. The flavors of the beef and chicken plates are amazing. Try the green, red or yellow curry. The Cat does not disappoint"}
{"text":"Delicious. I'm in love. The curry noodles are amazing. The staff was very kind and our food was served immediately. I've already recommended this place to my family. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"The food was good but what put this place over the top is the atmosphere (setting and service) great stuff!"}
{"text":"This place is easy to miss, but it's really delicious and cheap. Give it a try. It's one of my fave Thai places in Tempe."}
{"text":"Writing this as I sit and wait for my food to cool down! I feel compelled to make sure everyone knows how amazing this place is!  If you see a \"bad\" review it's because whoever wrote it is so stuck on 10star fine dining that they wouldn't know an AMAZING Thai place if it bit them in the rear!  Haha.  But seriously if you haven't been here you really need to come give it a try!  Unlike most other Thai places Siamese Cat uses REAL spices. You can see it on the bowl as you eat. The mild is nice so that you don't burn your face off again unlike some other places I've been to that mild is scorching hot!  The owners are the only employees and do a wonderful job EVERY SINGLE DAY!  Be patient because this is the definition of a \"Mom and Pop\" place. If you're here with a few other guests just keep in mind one man is slaving for your dinner.  But when you get it you will be more than pleased I promise you that!  We have been coming here for more than 3 years and it is always just as great as the first time. 

You are sure to find a seat due to its hidden location so feel free to bring friends along.  Would really like to see this place busy as ever, the owners deserve it.

If you read this and decide to try it out tell your waitress \"O\" that Steve sent you!!  


Happy Eating!"}
{"text":"While food tasted good and I was all set to chime in with 4 stars,  I suspect MSG in use from my reaction. Based on vintage decor and waitstaff puzzled response to my question about flour in the sticky rice pudding, that's my guess. Preservatives may be more essential when customers are few and far between which is what happens in a functionally obsolete strip mall with poor access off a one way freeway frontage road. The two stars are for Thai authenticity and attentive service."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. I liked the reviews I'd read and had been dying to go...because I love Thai food. I can't go because normally someone has a nut allergy and it just kills the fun for the others.

I rolled in tonight for a quiet girl chat night with a good friend of mine. It was unassuming and very clean - decor wasn't what I was expecting, but I was ok with that. The two mega loud grannies in the corner were a bit of a pain - I couldn't hear my friend talking over those 2 whose voices were so loud - did I really need to know your grand daughter got the type of medical procedure that most Christians despise while she was studying abroad? NO. I really didn't. And you really did not need to repeat that word over and over again.

The woman serving us was very sweet and very prompt with water - my glass was never empty! Definite plus in my book.

We decided to get an appetizer that was 'spicy'. I wish I had been paying attention to what the appetizer was called...ugh. It was pleasant enough to make me happy.

I wasn't too thrilled with my main dish - pad thai. It came with chicken and 2 pieces of shrimp - it looks so scrumptious I couldn't wait to tuck into it...I was so bummed. The sauce was a little too tomato-y for my taste. I Actually felt like I was eating spaghetti, but not quite. :(

My friend was enjoying her eggplant and chicken dish - it looked fab. I'll have to try it when I go back.

It's all right for now, but I'll be able to judge it better with a couple more visits."}
{"text":"The food is excellent and the owner is very kind and generous.  It isn't in a spot that gets a lot of traffic, so it is a great date night restaurant.  When you order take out everything is packaged very well, so there is no chance of messy spilling in the car."}
{"text":"They have a good looking lunch menu. Pretty decent pricing. But I was disappointed with the food. Had a red curry that fell flat. Didn't get the strong curry and spicy I needed and wanted from the dish. I might go back again for a $7 dollar lunch, but wouldn't pay more for semi-bland Thai food. 

--keep eatin"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for something like 15 years. I love it here. The pad Thai is amazing. So are the curry crunchy noodles. The dessert is to die for, the best sticky custard and rice I've ever had. The owner is a sweet heart also. I highly recommend this place. I feel good supporting their establishment."}
{"text":"I wanted it to be good because there lunch special was so cheap but cheap is exactly what we got"}
{"text":"Service was fantastic, the woman was so friendly and knowledgable of the menu. Food was good and authentic. Maybe not the best Thai food I have had in my life, but excellent favors. I could taste the lemongrass and other wonderful, fresh flavors in the Tom kha gai."}
{"text":"Best fried spring rolls I have ever seen! Ate here yesterday for the first time (Friday, lunchtime). Our GPS took us around our elbow to get there (you can turn into the lot from Baseline, don't have to get on Price), but has nice covered parking. Interior is small, quiet and comfortable. We were served very quickly, though I did see one couple who came in after us who had to seat themselves because the owner was in the back and didn't see them for a couple minutes. I had red curry and my partner had pad thai, along with thai tea of course - all very good! The best part was the little fried spring rolls: they looked made-in-house and were fresh and crispy. I think next time I will get just an appetizer of those and try one of the desserts."}
{"text":"I haven't had much time to write reviews lately, but I felt a need to post a quick review of siamese cat because the yelp review is way too high and very misleading.  My girlfriend and I stopped here because of the high yelp review. We go to a lot of thai restaurants around town, and this was by far the worst that we have been to. It has an inconvenient location in a somewhat rundown strip mall. The decor inside was not great and it was very empty on a weekend night which is a bad sign. The noodles were overcooked and stuck together in our pad thai. 

Thai Basil or Thai Elephant are both better choices for quick easy places in the same price range. Tott's is also really great and highly recommended."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of the Pad Thai at this place (see other reviews about my pickyness), but they have a great curry noodle dish!  This isn't something you would find at most Thai establishments here in the valley....yellow curry with mixed veggies and noodles...yum!  Their cute little springs rolls are pretty good too along with the veggie curry and of course sticky rice mango for dessert!  Not too heavy on your pocket and the owner, who is almost always there, is super friendly...if you go there as much as we have she will remember you and your order.  Location is kind of a strange, in an old strip mall in between the Real bar and one of those second-chance high schools.  If you can find it, enjoy!!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem in Tempe. It is a bit off the beaten path. A true mom and pop restaurant. I have been traveling in Thailand for several years and Siamese Cat hits the spot. This is the best I have eaten in the PHX area. This visit I had a yellow curry and a panang curry. The spice favor stood out and was truly amazing."}
{"text":"I have some friends who are madly in love with the Siamese Cat, but I just don't get it.  There is certainly nothing wrong with it, but my meals there have been less than passion-inducing.  

The problem may lie in their vegetarian options which is what I eat, but not my friends.  Maybe the meat is really good?

Last night we had this amazing (vegetarian) soup, but my meal part was just OK.  I don't think they really get tofu, it looked like it had been cut and steamed like a carrot.  

I am certain I will be going back, I am still holding out for being blown away by this place!"}
{"text":"Got the pad sieu and pad thai tonight. Both were pretty flavorless, especially the pad sieu, which tasted like salt and nothing else and had no sauce whatsoever. (I don't like my noodles drowned in sauce, but I'd expect some sort of flavor...)

Other dishes might be good, but I can't recommend these noodle dishes at all."}
{"text":"Such amazing Thai Food! Their Pad Thai is the best I've had. In addition, all of the curry varieties they offer create unparalleled options. A small and quaint location, primarily frequented by regulars provides patrons with an authentic and personal feeling! Try their Thai tea and their sticky rice dessert...you won't regret it!!"}
{"text":"First visit was for lunch about a year ago, and I tried one of their specialty noodle dishes (#100) and didn't enjoy it.  I was partly to blame since I only enjoy whole wheat and gourmet pastas, and rice and egg noodles either do not satisfy me, or I feel too guilty to enjoy eating them.  So I avoided the noodles and concentrated on the filling and found it blah.

I've since had Siamese Cat take-out twice in the past two weeks.  The household enjoyed the following very much:

#24 Rama w/ Beef (cabbage and peanut sauce topped w/ crispy egg noodles and red onion)
#27 Gaeng Keao Wan w/ Chicken (coconut green curry w/ green bell peppers, bamboo shoots, and basil)
#30 Gaeng Ped  w/ Chicken (red coconut curry w/ carrots, peas, bamboo shoots, and basil)
#103 Pad Pak Gratiem Prik Thai (chicken w/ pepper, fresh garlic, and \"chef's sauce\")

I am a fan of green curry of nany Thai restaurants (I'm told by a close Thai coworker/friend of mine that Thai curries are some of the easiest foods to prepare), but not this one. SC serves it with bamboo shoots, green bell pepper, basil, and coconut milk.  Green bell pepper (part of the nightshade family of plants and contains solanine, a glycoalkaloid that can trigger pain) is an inflammatory food, and since I'm allergic to many foods, I try to stay away from as many pro-inflammatory foods as I can.  Perhaps my slight aversion to green bell pepper (though I do like the flavor this item delivers in many recipes) mars my enjoyment of this dish since it plays such a major role here.  My only complaint with SC for now is that the entrees are a little too salty.  Otherwise, I'm a fan!  

BTW, deep-frying greatly decreases the glycoalkaloid content of nightshade plant foods... french fries and fried green tomatoes, anyone?  Too bad, fried foods can also trigger inflammation in blood vessels, among other symptoms of chronic inflammatory disorders/diseases..."}
{"text":"The Siamese Cat has been here forever it seems like! Tucked within a small little plaza, my first eating experience here was back in the '90s. Stepping into the restaurant again, it doesn't seem like they've changed much about the decor, or the prices!

We ordered a few items and shared an appetizer. The appetizer was a deep fried curry dumpling concoction. It was delicious. Our entrees (A cabbage salad and a chicken curry dish) were decent, but nothing spectacular. 

Service was good and the server was adept at steering us through the menu to find something we'd enjoy. 

Go here for the relaxed atmosphere and reasonable prices, and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I love the Siamese Cat. I was practically raised on their food and everyone I have brought here over the years has loved it. Good portions, tasty entrees, and really wonderful spring rolls. Wonderful wait staff as well."}
{"text":"I love this little mom and pop Thai restaurant.  This is a weekday lunch spot for me.  The service is great, the owner always remembers exactly what I like to order,  the atmosphere is very casual.  Don't let the run down strip mall and the location right next to a DES office turn you off; good food keeps this place going.  

If I am with friends we will get the Tom Ka Gai soup.  It is excellent!  For my entree i usually get the Gaeng Ped pork (Thai hot), which is a red curry dish with bamboo shoots.  If I am alone, I will get Gaeng Ped off the lunch menu which comes with an eggroll and a bowl of soup.  I also like the sweet Thai tea.  I always get the Gaeng Ped because it is just so good.  

Honestly, I have not tried very many other things on the menu since I love the Gaeng Ped so much."}
{"text":"This place is in such an odd location but worth the wandering to find it! I ordered take out and the food was ready in a timely manner. Customer service was great, thorough, and inviting. I got the pad woon sen and it was delicious! Not dry like some restaurants I've experienced, great texture and flavor. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Was here last night for dinner with friends.  It was a Friday night and the place was empty.  I ordered Pad King Sod and asked that it be spicy.  The waitress and I had a conversation about how spicy their levels were and I felt confident that she understood what I wanted.  She brought the dish to me knowing that there was no heat at all!!  She brought a jar of chili sauce and said that shoe was sorry.  That's it.  The chili sauce added a vinegar taste to it and the dish was horrible!  My husband ordered Pad Ryan MIT and asked for it to be mild spiciness.  It was very hot and had no other flavor at all.  The only vegetables were green peppers and onions.  This place was empty for a reason - there are many Thai places that are great in the area.  I don't understand how this restaurant stays in business."}
{"text":"We've been there twice.  The food is fresh but very bland.  We went the second time thinking other dishes would be tasty because at least the veggies were fresh but it was a disappointment. They could use a decorator."}
{"text":"In the San Francisco area, I have had good Thai and lousy Thai.  This place, by comparison, would count under the former.

Thai food, on the whole, isn't really my taste, but my wife and daughter really like it, so I head over to a Thai restaurant every once in a while with them.  As all the curry and coconut milk really doesn't do it for me, I tend to get Thai fried rices, etc. while I'm there.  

At The Siamese Cat, the food was good, but did not quite have the complexity that I am used to at the other Thai spots I have been to (in the Bay Area mostly.)  There was nothing whatsoever wrong with the food--it was just not as interesting as other places in my experience.  Less depth of flavor.

Would I discourage you from coming here?  Not at all.  Service and atmosphere were very pleasant.  Don't let my snobby tastes give you the wrong impression.  We had a nice meal here and will return sometime.  Give these folks a try."}
{"text":"This is not a super fancy place, but considering the reasonable cost, friendly and efficient service, great food and low key ambiance I have to give this place 5 stars. The lady serving us told me that this restauarnt had been around for 25 years - so it seems to have done well in a very competitive market. Strange that this was my first time despite having lived in Tempe for nearly 20 years. What was really nice was that they had several good choices for vegetarians. One of us had the Yellow curry in coconut milk with tofu, cabbage, water chestnuts, potato, carrots and onions vegetables in a light yellow curry sauce - boy was that very tasty. The price was very reasonable ($21 +tip) for a shared starter and 2 x entrees. We chatted to the lady and she was kind enough to give us a discount for our next visit.. The restaurant was fairly busy on a Friday night with a typical cosmopolitan Tempe crowd, but we were able to get a seat right away. The folks at the next table were trying the various deserts, but unfortunately I'm trying to lose weight - maybe next time....The Sangkhaya Coconut custard - a Thai custard made with coconut cream) looks good. We will definately add this to our list of great local restaurants. Give it 5 stars considering the very reasonable price.."}
{"text":"I eat here all the time and I really wish this place was busier. The food is great and the owners are both very friendly. The only real downside is there's no free refills. I usually drink water so it's not a big deal for me, but some people love their soda. They serve both lunch and dinner but they're closed from 2pm to 5pm- so get there early for lunch!"}
{"text":"My favorite Thai restaurant of all time!  The food is amazing and the service is great. The curry is my favorite, both red and yellow. Definitely a restaurant you don't want to miss out on!"}
{"text":"I have lived in the Phoenix metro area for 2.5 years now, and when I first moved here, I relied heavily on Yelp reviews and friends to tell me of good places to go to.  Unfortunately, Yelp wasn't used in the recommendation for this place, but a friend of mine took me here once and I thought everything was amazing.  I've been coming back ever since.  Last night, my fiancé and I went there for dinner.  For the appetizer, we ordered the Combination Special for two, which has a lot of favorites on it - the satay chicken, thai egg rolls, and my personal favorite, this little meat pie thing, which I don't know the name of.  LOL  My entree was a personal favorite of mine, the spicy noodle, and my fiancé ordered the pad thai, both equally delicious in their own right.  

To give a little background of this place, it's own by this cute couple who have owned the restaurant for over thirty years.  The husband does all the cooking, and the wife takes care of the front.  They take time off every now and then, so when that happens, their children help out, and the daughter looks just like her mom.  They're such a sweet family.  Each time we come here, there aren't too many people seated, but they have quite the following.  They get a lot of to-go orders and a lot of regulars.  Each time we've gone there for dinner, they've always been super friendly.  One time, my fiancé ordered something other than Pad Thai, and the lady said, \"What? No Pad Thai today?\"  It was funny and amazing she remembered because we had not been there in almost a year.

The location is in a weird place, and it's a little hole-in-the-wall, but I often find that the hole-in-the-wall places often serve the best food ever.  The best thing about this Thai restaurant is that they don't rely heavily on dry spices to spice up your dish:  they actually use FRESH Thai peppers to help spice things up, which is something I prefer.  So if you haven't been here yet.....WTF are you waiting for?  Get over there already!!!! Oh and for dessert, you must try the coconut ice cream.  It's not over-powering and not too sweet.  It's just right, with salted peanuts on top.  Yummo."}
{"text":"Lady that waited on us was super nice. The Pad Thai was not prepared well. I think they put ketchup on the noodles. The Ginger Shrimp, #39, was good though. 

I was hoping to leave a better review. Maybe next time..."}
{"text":"We'll worth finding, this authentic Thai restaurant offers more than just delicious food. The atmosphere is perfect for Date Night!"}
{"text":"I discovered this restaurant a few years ago and have yet to find a better Thai restaurant in the greater Phoenix area.  The restaurant is surprisingly slow considering how fantastic the food and service is.  It's not often that you find a place with amazing food and no wait for a table!  My favorites are the tom ka gai soup and curry noodles. 
Nearly every time I've gone here, the hostess/waitress always remembers us and is very courteous & friendly.
If you like Thai food, you have to check this place out!"}
{"text":"I feel the need to comment on this place primarily because of how great the service was. We went in roughly 6pm and were the only ones there. Was greeted by a very nice older lady who got us seated and drinks out immediately.

We got the appetizer for 2 (not a whole lot of food for 11 bucks) and it was great.
Also got the pad thai which was different than what Ive had in the past but it was still good.

Got the Mango dessert, which was amazing, then proceeded to also get the coconut custard because the mango was so good.
We liked the mango more, but this could also have been because we were getting full.

Overall a great experience and I will be back. To the lady who was our server-- Thank you very much.-- She seemed to be one of the owners because she took great pride in the restaurant.

We will be back."}
