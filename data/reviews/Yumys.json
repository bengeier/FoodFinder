{"text":"Zero star unfortunately there is no option for zero star. Worst experience ever. I bought a chicken sandwich which I found it was uncooked and show it to them. One of the employee came forward and argued even the son of owner came and gave me reason that his fryers at 350 c and can't be uncooked without looking at the uncooked sandwich... surprised with their most stubborn nature towards customer... Not willing to go there anymore even employer don't know what customer service is..."}
{"text":"The food is very good for the price. Its cheaper than both KFC and Popeyes but the quality is there!"}
{"text":"Saw this as a new store around the area and wanted to give it a try.   The grand opening special is over, and there is a monthly special of 3.99 for a chicken sandwich. Came during lunch and there is only one person working there.   Wanted to try the sandwich and chicken.  My boyfriend ordered the chicken sandwich whereas I ordered the 3 piece combo (spicy) that came with a side, drink and biscuit.   After ordering, a young lady walked in and ordered 2 student specials pointing to her phone.  I wasn't able to find anything online regarding it, so I'm not sure what the student special entitles.  She ordered, then the employee went to the back. The chicken are made to order, but it did feel like a long time. I think it took 25 minutes before he came out with my 3 piece meal, sandwich, and the lady's student special. I wonder how quickly the meals come out during lunch weekdays when people are on a time constraint.   There are 2 tables there, so decided to eat it hot and fresh. It comes in a cute box.  Opened it up and had 2 legs and 1 thigh, some onion rings (my side) and a biscuit.   Nothing is put on the outside for self service. Such as napkins, ketchup, forks... All put on their side. The downfall was if I wanted more napkins or ketchup, I had to call him out of the kitchen while he was preparing food.    The chicken was crispy, juicy and hot.  However I didn't find it spicy at all, so I'm not sure if he gave me the mild one, or if that's how the spicy one is supposed to be.  I much prefer Popeyes blend of spices.  The onion rings were okay, but the biscuit was so good!! Soft and fluffy and wasn't dense at all. Better than Popeyes.  Definitely worth a try.   My boyfriend said the sandwich was okay, the presentation looked good, but he said it kept falling apart and was loosely put together.   Another thing like someone mentioned... There's no garbage can inside.  So they offer eat in with 2 tables, but don't offer you anywhere to throw your garbage. We had to gather our garbage and walk to the bus stop at finch to throw away before getting into our car. Otherwise 3 star for food.  Minus 1 star for no garbage can, and slow service/set up.   Not sure if I would come back, as I prefer the crunch and spice on Popeyes more, and the pricing is similar."}
{"text":"So I came across this newly opened food place in my area, so I thought I'll check it out. Was craving chicken late at night, found their phone number via photos on Yelp, and was surprised they are open til midnight!  Tried the Opening Special: 2 pc chicken and biscuit for $2.99. Also got fries and small gravy.  Service was quick, didn't wait longer than 5 mins for our food to arrive. The chicken was 2 big pieces, nice and crispy and very juicy. The biscuit was tasty and delicious, one of my faves!  The fries are nice and spiced up a bit. However I find the gravy watered down, so that wasn't so good in my opinion.  Overall, a solid chicken joint and definitely worth a try, since it is a newly opened food place.  Would come back again for sure to try their mini chicken sandwich and BBQ chicken wings."}
{"text":"It's like 60% popeyes and 40% KFC, you can get mild or spicy, try it!"}
{"text":"Went to Yumys cause I was in the area after going to a friends shop. This was from a words of mouth, at first glance the place is quite small but there was 2 tables and a couple of stools by the windows. It is a chicken and seadfood joint. I ordered a 3 piece spicy chicken meal and it came with 2 piece breast and 1 drum along with Cajun fries and a fresh biscuit + a drink. The chicken is nicely marinated and the fries were crispy. Overall the meal is quite large for 1 person. They have daily specials which I should of took some pictures of, but I'll try to get some next time when I am in the area.  All in all, I would go back and try the seafood and sandwiches."}
{"text":"If you're talking about the food I give it a 4 very good similar quality you would get at a Popeyes or a KFC and really kind family owned staff. They have a 4.44 deal which comes with fries and 2 pic chicken. My friend got the chicken sandwich and it was HUGE AND TASSY AND FRESH! I would go here  again"}
{"text":"A very good quantities of chicken Drums & Thighs, but a bit oily! Love their onion rings. Good French fries and coleslaw."}
{"text":"I am hating myself so much while writing this review. I ate 3 pieces of Yumys Fried Chicken for lunch early this afternoon.   I was luckily I did not eat the 2 orders of $2.79 for 2 pieces I got and gave the biggest piece to my co worker. I think she is hating me right now.  Fresh from the deep fryer they were just so juicy but seriously oily. And they were huge pieces.  Spicy lacked the spiciness and I waited 15 minute as they were made when ordered.  I now know why I only eat Fried Chicken once in awhile..... I still hating myself into the evening as I could feel my arteries clogging up. Or just my imagination?!"}
