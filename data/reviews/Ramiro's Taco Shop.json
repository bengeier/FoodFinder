{"text":"Worst fast food taco shop I have ever been to & tried it twice to see if first time was just an off day and it was not. Disappointed since its so close to home & do not recommend. Don't bother with place & keep searching,  I know I will . if I could would give zero stars."}
{"text":"One of the best fish burritos in town! Servings are generous. Atmosphere is clean and prices are reasonable. Staff is courteous with quick service."}
{"text":"Horrible. Skip this place and go somewhere with REAL Mexican food! The chimichanga came with 80% beans and less meat than you'd get in a 50 cent microwave burrito. When I called to complain, the person told me they \"\"have to use beans to make it go down in the fryer.\" WTF? I guess EVERY other place just knows how to make it go down in the fryer with only meat inside. I paid $8 for something I wouldn't even throw at a mangy dog. I eat at little taco shops all over the state and this one is hands down the worst I've tried!"}
{"text":"We use yelp.com anytime we are out of town and want a great place to eat. We weren't disappointed again...Ramiro's is great...generous portions, great prices, huge selection...you can even get most everything ala carte. We were visiting my parents and told them about Ramiro's. They said they have driven by many, many times...not any more! I had the biggest, best carnitas chimichanga I have ever seen. Can't wait to come back and have the taco salad. Don't drive by this place!"}
{"text":"Good Carne Asada plate.  I keep coming here for their hot salsa of all things.  I like how everything is made-to-order."}
{"text":"Sad and devastated to hear that they might be closing down :-(...Friendly staff, quick service, and amazing and cheap food!!!! Homemade salsas are DA BOMB, good fish tacos, burritos,  chimicangas, chipotle carne fries -- all so tasty, and freshly made!!!!"}
{"text":"Read the reviews so thought we would give it a try. Had the cheese enchilada platter. Lacked flavor and spice. The refried beans looked and tasted like they came out of a can. My wife had the shrimp burrito, with cheese enchilada,  the burrito came  out after we had finished the enchiladas.  It was a good sized portion but lacked flavor.  I was hoping to like this place but was disappointed and will not be back."}
{"text":"Okay I only gone once since I was out in the Sun Lakes area and there is not many options for Mexican (That I  can see. No Taco Bell is not real Mexican food folks). It was okay. The portions are generous and the place inside looks clean. Drive through service was prompt and courteous as well as FAST. Ordered a tostada and enchilada by drive thru.  Beans were a little bland for me but the taco sauce that I added helped. Maybe its because its in a well ''Senior Community'' they cater to people who cannot take spice? *Shrugs* Will give it another go because I prefer to support smaller business over the big chains. Nice but as someone who hails from S Ca Ive had better."}
{"text":"The worst Mexican food I have ever eaten.  Having lived in Az most of my life, I know good Mexican food.  Not sure what the meat was on the loaded nachos, but it tasted some what like mushy bad hash.  Chicken tacos were only slightly better.  I rarely put a restaurant on the \"never going back\" list but that is my plan.  I wish I had thought to photograph the food before I ate it.  Try any other place first."}
{"text":"Skip this place.  I have been here several times in the last few years and everytime I come, I regret it.  Today, I had the worst tacos EVER.  Tacos are a basic at a Mexican restaurant.  Really, they were far worse than any taco I have had in the last 15 years. I am not kidding.  The tacos shells looked a funny color, smelled bad and they tasted absolutely DISGUSTING.  There was also barely any chicken in the tacos and the lettuce looked and tasted like it was old.  If you think this is the \"best Mexican restaurant,\" you must be crazy or on drugs.    Cross this one off the list.  You've been warned!!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, Ramiro's closed down January 27th, 2018.  The owner retired.  This was my go to place for Mexican food, I will miss it.  Unfortunately Filibertos is moving in; I'm not too excited about this establishment.  Not my favorite Mexican food."}
{"text":"We went again last night and I ordered the chimi plate. We got home and I opened the box and my eyes almost popped out of my skull at how ginormous it was! I got the shredded beef and it tasted as good as it looked. I think the whole plate was something like $6.25 or so, which is an awesome deal for the portion. Plus they put sour cream, cheese, lettuce, pico, and guac on it which is usually extra at other places. I definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Just had my favorite shrimp burrito and it was terrible! Very few shrimp and so old and dry not edible! They are off my list forever! Go at your own peril!"}
{"text":"Just bought a breakfast burrito and it was horrible. The tortilla was rubbery, half the bacon was burned, eggs had no flavor and they forgot to add the potatoes I asked for.  I just wasted $5."}
{"text":"This is what heaven would taste like if heaven had a taste... hands down my favorite FAST Mexican joint in town, I have not had a bad thing on the menu. The people who run this place are impeccably nice, and always respectful. Listen if you want a bad burrito that tastes like Chef Boyardee, go to taco bell... you want the real deal! come here."}
{"text":"I love this place.  This is exactly what I expect from a taco shop.  Good food, nice friendly staff and a decent price.  The burritos are huge and so flavorful.  I love the Rami Burrito; Carne Asada, Shrimp, Bacon with cheese, pico and fries!"}
{"text":"This place is like Filiberto's used to be. There Carne Asada plate is my go to and it's good. It's only $7."}
{"text":"Have too say this place has changed I have been coming here for year and always had a great experience until now first off the lady who is working this morning 11/23/15 7:22 am is rude not nice and over charged me by 1.30 and I questioned her on it and she argued with me I guess it time to find another place for my food"}
{"text":"I ordered a burrito from this place and it was absolutley terrible.  It tasted like they took a can of chef boyardee wrapped and nuked it in the microwave.  Was absolutley too hot and I felt sick afterwards.   I will not be givong this place another chance."}
{"text":"Came and ate here for my 30 break and ordered chilli relleno with beans and rice. While i was eating my beans I suddenly saw a SCREW and asked the lady that worked there. They had the guts to get mad and thought i sabotaged my fave food that i always order. THEY SEEM TO NOT CARE WHEN I TALKED TO THEM ABOUT THE ISSUE. I feel like the health inspector should be checking this place. I didn't get to take a picture since my friend went and grabbed it away from me to talk to the manager."}
{"text":"Awesome Carne Asada. Great homemade refried beans. Very good service. OK fish tacos. Way, WAY out in Sun Lakes..."}
{"text":"They actually cook to order. Carne Asada is really good. Rolled tacos are really good. California burrito is awesome, love the green sauce.   Mom and pop burrito shop. Same dude working the drive through most times. He is very friendly. Portions are large and this is a far above average taco shop."}
{"text":"I really liked my taco it was crispy and delightful. The service was friendly.   I am a senior citizen and I got a discount.   When I look for somewhere to have lunch I hope it would be close to my home, this was very close."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and good food at a more than fair price! Love Love love the tortillas and the bean and cheese burros and the cheese quesadillas!"}
{"text":"We happened to be in the area and wanted some rolled tacos man oh man, I love the white cheese on the tacos and it taste so good not too hard right amount of meat. I recommend and I will be back if in that area. Does any one know of other locations???"}
{"text":"Pretty much the same as all the other small taco shops.  Same menu and prices.  Same food.  Filiberto's must have had a LOT of children."}
{"text":"I don't understand all the hate this place gets, some of you are to privileged it's ridiculous. Get over yourselves. This place is amazing I love it and I have never had any issues!"}
{"text":"Just okay. Been here twice thinking there must be something on the menu that I will love. Nope nothing really stands out, but good enough if you need something that stick to your stomach. Still not spicy enough or flavorful to  recommend it to people I know. I have only done the drive through. It looks clean and the drive up people are professional May give it another shot but will keep looking."}
