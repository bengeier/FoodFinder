{"text":"Butter chicken is to die for. All of the versions of naan are awesome. Service is always great."}
{"text":"I order from them a lot because there's no Indian places close to here that deliver. So you'll get the most honest review right here, because I've had to just deal with what I don't like, and stick to what I do like!!! They're extremely courteous, and I appreciate that part, but I think they really could improve in terms of their food quality and they definitely need to make some changes.

When the food is GOOD, it's fresh and fast but pretty average in terms of the taste. It is not as flavourful as I would expect but it does the job when I'm craving Indian food. 

When it's BAD it's stale, or really bland, or utterly disappointing because it's not what you'd expect the dish to be at all. And when it's bad it's extra upsetting because their prices are a bit too high.

THE BEST of what I've tried:

Biryani: This is what I always get, and it's OK when it's fresh. It's not the best I've ever tasted but also not the worst. It will get you through your biryani craving, but it's not the most satisfying or authentic. A bit bland compared to what I'm used to and not as much chicken as you'd expect, but it's stil tasty enough for me to order it several times, and it's boneless chicken which I always like. Like I said, when it's fresh it's tolerable.
However, I've had it delivered a couple of times when I ordered late in the evening, a couple hours to an hour or so before they close, and it seems like they're reluctant to make a new batch. A couple times it was stale plain rice mixed in with biryani rice. Was extra pissed off about that. But it hasn't happened again since the last time -- Just make sure you don't order too late.
UPDATE: In a recent order, the biryani was made with LARGE chunks of bell pepper(yes, bell pepper, orange bell pepper to be exact, which is really not what you'd expect in a biryani) and massive pieces of onion too. It was awfully disappointing.

Samosas: One order gets you two large potato/pea samosas, they're decent, they're typical samosas you'd get in the Indian grocery.

Naan: Plain, garlic and Kashmiri naan are what I've tried, all pretty good. Never had Kashmiri naan before, but it was good, very different and I would order again.

Rasmalai: Decent, typical rasmalai (ie: yummy).

THE WORST of what I've tried:

Paneer Tikka: This was extremely disappointing. The sauce was very thin, was extremely bland to the point where I considered calling to complain. But that's such a pain in the ass and when you've waited all that time to get your order, you just say \"to hell with it\".

Chicken Tikka: This is not the kind of chicken tikka you're probably used to if you eat a lot of Indian food. It doesn't seem like it's been marinated in any spices, there's no red colour, no colour at all actually. Just PLAIN pieces of chicken, which is not what you go to an Indian restaurant for!!!"}
{"text":"Love the quality, sattvic cooking style and food. We go there all the time. There are many great places in town. This is one of them on the healthier side. Very kind hosts, the sag-paneer is second to none with the freshness and quality, the dhal is beautiful. 

I consider this the healthy tasty version of indian food. We love the greasy kind as well, and all in between. Unless I see something from behind the scenes showing terrible cooking practices we'll continue to go there almost once a month. 

But oh so many good places!"}
{"text":"I've only ever had take-out from here. Each time the food arrived quickly and was quite good and reasonably priced, although it did seem to be very oily compared to other Indian food I've had. I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Very, very disappointing.  I just moved to the neighbourhood and was happy to see an Indian restaurant close by.  Unfortunately, my first $20 meal felt like it should have cost $5, it was so bad.  I always order lamb korma at any Indian restaurant, I've been to a dozen of them and it's never been as bad as at Agra.  This one had so many onions inside that it felt like chomping on a whole onion.  No nut or meat flavour, and not much curry richness, either.  And it's truly dire when your paratha bread -- which is supposed to be flaky, crispy and appetizing -- tastes even worse than packaged naan bread from a supermarket.

The cleanliness issue mentioned by other reviewers is real.  I didn't have the misfortune of sitting down for the meal -- I had ordered food for pickup -- but while I was there, I was staring at a few cookers with soup left inside, and the inside of the cookers looked like one of those things left on the floor of tiny restaurants in Chinatown.

This area is teeming with great food and lovely, well curated restaurants, so I have no idea how a place like Agra can survive.  If you want Indian food, take a walk up a few blocks to Freshslice pizza near Empress Ave.  The Indian-style chicken they have as toppings is leagues better than Agra's meat at about a third of the price.

Won't be coming back, ever."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, wonderful selection of the buffet and a great ambience. The waiter helping us - Probal was a wonderful guy and gave us a great service. Would definitely go back again for the wonderful butter chicken, vindaloo and Prabals service. Thank you Agra."}
{"text":"Great food for the price. One of my favourite indian buffets as I feel the price is great for the taste. Yummy butter chicken, good Naan and rice, with other dishes that have flavour. Doesn't disappoint."}
{"text":"I ordered the combination platter for takeout. Place was empty 8pm on a Saturday night but phone was ringing off the hook for takeout orders. Food was basic, nothing spectacular. Platter comes with tandoori style prawns, but should read \"prawn\", since there was only one. Lamb was very tender, definitely the highlight of the platter. Overall decent, not as expensive as some of the other Indian options on King St. but sometimes you get what you pay for..."}
{"text":"Hey all,

Okay, firstly let me say, I'm very genuine the reason I'm writing this review is based on the order I just received I'm hoping it spares someone.

I just spent upwards of $70.00 and got 2 chicken dishes (vindalloo and butter chicken, aloo Gobi, malai kofta, garlic naan and rice).

There was such a tiny portion of chicken as to be unheard of. There was 4 dumplings in the malai kofta (it's about $13) and they were awful and pasty. The $4 odd dollars for he naan, well flavour was good, but there was 1 piece. No folks no joke. $4 - one piece of naan bread.

Over all food was sub par, and extremely over priced for what you get. There is much better to be had elsewhere.

This restaurant used to be good, hence the reviews, and I can't speak to dining in but the take out, in the words of Gordon Ramsay \"DAMN!!!\" Well that and %^**%%}}!!!?? Rip off!!!"}
{"text":"Last night I decided to satisfy an on-going craving for Agra's yellow dal. It may seem silly to crave a dish so simple but it's been a favourite of mine since I tried it at Agra's original location in North York. 

My husband and I wanted to keep our meal simple so in addition to the yellow dal we ordered the okra. It was perfectly cooked and beautifully spiced. Okra is often hit and miss at restaurants because once over cooked it can become slimy. We added two tandoori roti to our order and had a fabulous meal.

The service was amazing from start to finish. I used to be a regular at their first restaurant when I lived just steps away and I'm so happy to have them in my new neighbourhood downtown. 

They've always been very accommodating to our vegan diet and also any requests for limited oil or spice level depending on my mood for heat. 

To those reviewers who say this is not authentic Indian food, I'm not sure what to tell you. I've eaten my way around India, I married into an Indian family and I have no complaints. My husband and his family also love the food. Maybe you're used to eating from a different part of India?? Or maybe you had a an isolated experience. I highly suggest giving these guys a chance. They're a consistent favourite of mine and their prices are not at all out of line with other places in the city.

I can also highly recommend their samosas, pakoras, channa, baingan bharta, vegetable jalfrezi and vegetable vindaloo. 

We didn't order apps or drinks so our meal with tax and tip came to just under $30."}
{"text":"Very good food, Chicken tikka masala was enough to make my family jealous. We dont get GOOD indian food like this at home, so this was a rare treat. Along with Toronto's diverse culture comes its diverse culinary options! Service here was also top notch, I couldnt empty my glass, the waiter was simply too quick. Definitely a repeat stop next time I am in town."}
{"text":"I felt like Indian with delivery and found this place on Yelp. The location is close to where I live and there was no delivery charge, though I was asked to tip the driver (odd, no?). Delivery was timely, taking about 35 minutes. The food was delivered at a great temperature.

We ordered a full tandoori chicken, vegetable pakoras, eggplant bharta, raita, and naan. Overall, I was pleased with the quality, though everything falls short of getting a \"great\" rating. The tandoori chicken had not absorbed the seasoning well enough for my liking. The eggplant bharta was to finely mashed, and the raita never even made it. I called back to ask for a refund on the raita and was offered a free one the next time around.

I will order from here again, though I won't be in a rush to do so and may try some of the competition before circling back."}
{"text":"This is a late review, I've been a bit behind with all my travels =D

I've been to this place twice and the first time it was meh, I didn't even want to bother with a review. I am so traumatized by my last experience that I had to. They don't care about cleanliness or their customers' well being. I ordered the butter chicken and there was a fly in my food. The manager or owner just brushed it off like IZ NORMAL. Fyi, IZ NOT NORMAL. On top of everything the food isn't even that great. How is this place still running!? Maybe the secret ingredient in their curry is BUGS!!!! -_-"}
{"text":"Best Rogan gosh (lamb) in town. Hands down! Rice is ify. Paranthas are great. Bharta is very good. Very friendly staff. If you are picking up, you can park in their spot round the back and they will open the back door. 
Its on Yonge, so no parking in front. If you eat there, make sure you go for the grill platter. Never really had a complaint at that place. This is one place where you really want to tip well. They work hard for their service."}
{"text":"I ordered the AGRA PALACE DINNER (COMBO)[A superb combination of tandoori chicken, reshmi kabob, jumbo prawn,lamb Kodai Gosht, vegetables of the day-which was Chana masala,pulao rice and naan bread]-for two. Their website says \"You will call this a real feast\"-A bold statement! And they didn't live up to it.I will never be ordering from this place again ...Neither will I be going there ----like ever! So,here's the good,bad and the ugly:

The good : The lady taking the order was courteous,pleasent and nice.(as one must be in the service industry)What I liked though is the she was willing to accommodate my request to change one item from their combo-I wanted to try their butter chicken instead of the lamb kadai gosht.She informed me of the delivery time and said there maybe delays due to the weather (it was snowing). I liked that- she gave me a heads up so I was prepared-there were no surprises!The other good part was the way food was packed.They were all packed neatly in aluminium foil containers which kept the food hot when we opened it.I can't tell you how much it bothers me when restaurants use Styrofoam to pack their hot food. 

The bad and the ugly :When I proceeded to inquire of  any gluten content in my order, I was faced with the question-what is gluten?!Seriously? I mean I don't expect everyone in the world to know about celiac disease/gluten allergies but I do expect People running a business in the food industry to bloody well be aware of all food related allergies.Next,lets discuss the food:The pulao was good and so was the Chana Masada.But what completely put me off was the tandoori kababs and the butter chicken.The tandoori  stuff tasted like they were a day old if not more.The shrimp was disgusting!I had to spit it out of my mouth after taking a bite of it.What was prepared in the name of butter chicken made me want to barf! Have you ever tasted Maggi instant tomato soup?Yes.Im referring to the powder that you get in satches-the kind that you mix with hot water and let boil. Remember those?How would you feel if that was used as a sauce for your butter chicken?Won't you be disgusted? Yup!That was my reaction.Need I say more? I think not.You get the point right?Now I'm questioning every item on their menu.Well,don't be like me.Just don't eat their food.Find something else."}
{"text":"The lunch buffet is a fantastic deal. Likewise the dinner portions are slightly too small for the price they charge.

The food is always consistently yummy. Sure it's not the level  of tastiness of a high end restauarant but still impressive for a small family run restaurant.

Recommended for lunch.

Less recommended for dinner."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today, the buffet was not refilled at 1pm. Took a bit of time for the nice waitress to get drinks, she was the only one in the restaurant. Not a place to go for a business lunch. 

Mutton was not cooked properly.

Will not not go back again."}
{"text":"This place is great!  Me and my boyfriend are vacationing in Niagara Falls this weekend and drove up to Toronto for the day to go to a Blue Jays game.  My friend's cousin has been to Toronto a lot and she said we have to King's Street to eat, lots of great restaurants there.  Well, I didn't get the name of anywhere specific or read any reviews.  We were just walking along and thought Indian food sounded really good and it sooo was!  I got Butter Chicken and he got Channa Masala,  Both really really good.  Samosa appetizers were awesome, too.  So was the Naan.  It was actually the best naan I've had.  Then we were talking with our waiter and told him we're from the states and after our meal he brought out a little dessert for us and said \"for our American friends!\"  Fully recommend Agra!"}
{"text":"I had the buffet and wow! It had such a delicious kick in the spices :) Lovely attentive waiters kept refilling my water glass. I hadn't planned on the buffet which is why I only sampled a few dishes, so I am definitely going back with an empty stomach!"}
{"text":"Ok Wow it blows my mind this place has 4 stars. I just ordered $40 worth of the most regrettable indian food of my life from this place and I don't even know where to begin. I'm not even Indian. I don't even KNOW what authentic Indian food is, and even I cannot believe this place has the audacity to call itself Indian fine dining.

Here is what was wrong

1) I ordered aloo (potato) parathas - supposed to be rolled flat breads with stuffing rolled into the bread. What did I get? Stale, nasty naan split open and stuffed (totally different thing)

2) I ordered onion kulcha - this is supposed to be a specific kind of naan with onion stuffing. Never mind that the same stale bread was used as in the paratha - the onion kulcha and aloo (potato) paratha had the same filling! WTF?!

3) I ordered chicken tikka - aka BBQ chicken - instead (I wish I could attach a photo - so nasty) I got tiny pieces of chicken that were so clearly made in a frying pan and NOT EVEN BBQ FLAVOURED OR CRISPY! They were yellow. and the pan was full of watery chicken juice. Such a disappointment

4) I ordered chickpea masala. Maybe I'm just so disgusted with the $40 I just threw away I'm being nitpicky but this was just not good. Canned chickpeas tossed in a nasty sauce that was dry on top (like you know when you leave smth out and the top layer dries out? like that)

5) I also ordered some yoghurt sauce - which was ok, and mango chutney which wasn't the greatest (too sweet, clearly store bought)

I'm TELLING you, go to some other place - tons of amazing options on Queen W and King W less than a block from this place. Unless you want truly overpriced food that isn't good, or what it is suppose to be! 

If you have any lingering doubts the entire restaurant was totally empty when I picked up my food. Always a bad sign."}
{"text":"The Appearance:
=============
On the outside Agra Fine Indian Cuisine looks like a really small place, but once you go inside you can see that there is enough room to seat a lot of people. The building is old and has some character. They have cool copper water pitchers which looks awesome and i wish they would sell these sot hat I could bring them home.

The Food:
========
The food is great for the price that you pay, lots of selection, don't forget to try the soup in the corner on a bed of rice that is sitting in a croc pot. The naan bread was fresh and you can tell that it has been made in a tandoori oven. 

They have more vegetarian items for lunch than they do for dinner, but that doesn't mean that there aren't enough of them at dinner. There is lots to choose from and some very healthy options.

The pakoras are nice, but I have definitely had better, they do not have samosa's in their buffet (at least the ones that I have been to) which is a little disappointing, fortunately they have enough other things to make up for it.

If you like deserts, the gulab jamun is fresh and well made here."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant only once.  I order the typical butter chicken and taan.  Nothing special.  Prices are a bit steep for Indian food.

It was not too busy for a Friday night (maybe half the restaurant was full).  They seem to do a lot of takeout though."}
{"text":"I dropped in one night on a whim, never tried Indian food before and I have to tell ya I hope my next experience at an Indian restaurant is better or I'll be staying away from it for a little while.  It started with the service, which was slow and it seemed that I was more of a problem then a guest in their establishment.  I tried a variety of the dishes because their were a few of us at the table, and normally i would name what I ate and give a little description but it just seemed all the food was uninspired, dry and some seemed crispy like it was under a heat lamp for an extended period of time.  It was far from a good dining experience and I might have had a hint food poisoning due to uncalled visits to the washroom during the evening.  I wouldn't recommend this place and hope my next Indian dining experience is the complete opposite from what I experienced here."}
{"text":"The restaurant is small and the decor is not the best, but the food is always good and tasty.  Service can be slow and the waiters are not always on the ball, but they are polite.  Washrooms are tiny and down some very narrow stairs in the basement! 

I've had their lunch buffet often, it's reasonably priced and always fresh.  Good selection with about ten dishes and fresh tandoori chicken.  My favourites are the butter chicken and palak paneer (curry spinach and cheese).  The butter chicken is creamy rich and they only use white meat.  Curry goat is delicious, too.  I've had better naan elsewhere, but for soaking up the sauces it's just fine.  For dessert, don't overlook the small ice cream freezer opposite the buffet table!  They usually have mango, vanilla, chocolate and/or strawberry.  Dinner entree portions are on the small side, so if you can get there for lunch it's a better deal."}
{"text":"I went to Agra for lunch a couple of days ago for their lunch buffet, and I have been suffering from severe food poisoning ever since. The buffet is so extensive that I'm not sure how fresh all these items are, not to mention the desserts. I fell sick within hours of my meal, and still have symptoms 48 hours later. 

The food was tasty, but considering how sick I have been ever since, this is not a place I would recommend - I will not be visiting Agra ever again myself."}
{"text":"I am late to write this review. I went to this place once and suffered from bouts of food poisoning, vomited after eating here. Staff here are extremely unprofessional. I believe they gave me left overs and when i questionned them about the quality of food, they didn't seem to care. For all those who want to go there, please be careful. I wonder how this place is being allowed to operate."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing -- I love Indian food, and this is some of the best I've had.  As someone noted previously, the rogan gosh is wonderful.  They are serious when they warn things are spicy, so take heed if you are at all sensitive.  We had to take our super hot tandoori chicken to go so that we could calm it with some yogurt and have it as leftovers.  But, it was our own fault, we were warned.  And it was great as leftovers.

The service here is a bit on the slow side - I think they are going for an unhurried vibe, but at times we had to call them over for routine things like keeping water topped up.

I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"It doesn't look like much from the outside and its simple décor inside isn't much to write home about... but the food is amazing! I went with a party 8 people on a Friday evening and it was really quite busy and only 2 servers and  they did tremendously well.
We all had a mixtures of dishes, butter chicken, vindaloo , tikka masala, naan breads and they even did a special of bombay potatoes ( it wasn't on the menu! ) the food was just divine! I will go back for sure ."}
{"text":"I ordered take-out from Agra  yesterday because I live nearby, and have passed by it several times. I have never been tempted to go in before because it always seems empty, and also there are several other Indian restaurants in the area, including Tandoori House almost right next door. 
However, I was craving Indian and decided I would give this place a try based on some of the positive reviews on yelp.

I was disappointed. We ordered some favourites. Chicken Tikka Masala, Palak Panner, Channa Masalla  and Two Naans. The Chicken was flavourless and the sauce tasted like something I could buy in a bottle in a grocery store. The Saag Paneer looked about a week old - it was dry and needed salt ...or any kind of flavour. The Channa Masalla and Naans were fine.

I appreciate that the server gave me a 20% discount coupon when I picked up my order, but I shall not be using it ever!"}
{"text":"Had a horrible experience here.  Service was very strange on the particular night I went.  I went for dinner, and the place was completely empty.  Service looked like maybe the manager was not around, and these guys (about 4 of them working) did not want to be there.  Food, horrible.  Not sure if I got the leftovers from lunch buffet, but made both of us that went sick.  I have not wanted to visit any Indian restaurant in the Yonge and Sheppard area since I went to this one.  THAT was how bad my experience was.  Lots of food remained (I usually order to take home leftovers).  I just paid, left my money on the table and walked out."}
{"text":"It was either AGRA, or the Tandoori House three doors down. AGRA had people in it, Tandoori House did not. The choice was obvious, or so I thought.

You know those TV shows like Kitchen Nightmare, or Restaurant Makeover? Well, this restaurant was like the 'Before' photo. Agra is at the heart of North York, yet I felt like I was at a ethnic eatery in the middle of Owen Sound. This place literally felt shabbier than the Boston Pizza across the street...or any Boston Pizza for that matter. 
I came here with Chris. At this point of my life, the closest I've come to Indian food is packaged samosas found at my local No Fills, in the $10 value section. I guess you can say; I was pretty excited about ordering. I've been watching Gordon Ramsay's episode of Great Escape to India all day, and curry was all I could think of.

Chris: Butter Chicken with some kind of rice. Diet Coke.
Me: Curry Chicken, Lamb Briyani rice, and samosas. Regular yoghurt drink.

I was staring at the four girls two tables down from us, probably on their estrogen night out. Four Chinese girls, wanting to try something different..and somehow ended up here. I think it was the \"Fine Dining\" written on the sign outside that lured them in. It certainly was what got me. I don't appreciated being lied to.

The food came relatively fast, and the buttered chicken was served on a sizzling plate with onions that surprisingly wasn't burnt. It looked like a two chicken legs that got themselves a Jersey Shore tan. But maybe that's how all butter chicken looked, I certainly didn't know any better. Is it butter chicken, or buttered chicken? It says butter chicken on the menu, but that's just sounds like bad grammar. 
I don't know what rice Chris got, it was plain and flavourless. My Chicken Curry came in something that resembled a butter globe with the lid removed with a contraption that held the dollar store candle beneath it. It was anything but a generous portion. My Biryani rice however, was plentiful. The Chicken was dry, and I couldn't really taste the curry in the sauce. The evaporated onion & tomatoes in the sauce overwhelmed whatever spices used for the curry, and the base of the sauce was flat. The flaky sauce paired fine with my rice, but the dry chicken was what ruined it. My samosas didn't have any green peas inside...but that's like the best part of the samosa! In my opinion.
The butter(ed) chicken was not dry, but it wasn't tender either. I felt that everything lacked flavour. I didn't really notice the lamb in my rice until I remember I ordered lamb briyani rice. I suspect the curry here are made all with the same base. That's just not very Indian.
I did however enjoy the sweeten yoghurt lassi. I had to suck pretty hard through their thin straw, but it was very good. I might turn this place into my bubble tea alternative. But really, sucking so hard on a straw for a glass filled with white stuff across the table from my straight male friend was uncomfortable. 
At the end, we got this wet pastry ball for dessert, which was free. I have no idea what is was, but it was pretty good. The bill came out to $53....nothing Buddhist about that.

So with the food not being very exciting, I turned my attention back to the four girls. Why four...was it like Carry Bradshaw and her three friends? Like Sex & the City? They always met up in posh looking restaurants. So, maybe this was Sex & the City lost their jobs, moved to Toronto and started writing the relationship column for EYE. 
EYE doesn't exist now..so, that's two jokes in one...yeah? Funny right? I know..


Oh, you know how some restaurant hang rugs on the walls? This one actually framed it.......

AGRA...NamaSHITay."}
{"text":"went there with a friend for lunch, it was buffet.

the place was quite small but with a lot of places to sit! they have large tables too!

the service was great , fast and friendly people.

the buffet include:
 one soup
 2 or 3 salad options
 many dips and sauces 
1 rice 
3-4 kind of vegetable dishes
5-6 meat dishes (include chicken, lamb, beef, shrimps)
they also have bread (nan) and appetizers (could not remember the names)
they also have desserts (2 kinds) and fruits 

the taste was very good and not too spicy, however they have really extreme spicy sauces! 

the price was around 10 dollars 

as a neighborhood restaurant it one of the best options in the area and for sure I'll be back :)"}
{"text":"Only the second time I have been to an Indian restaurant in my time in Canada so again left disappointed.

Started with a lentil soup, my friend loved it, for me it was not so tasty. Maybe I compare everything to my mom's cooking but this soup was slightly bland and rushed.

For mains I had a Prawn Jalfrezi, the prawns had absolutely no flavour so the dish was dependent on the mixture of peppers and onions for flavour and the sauce. Did not work and I did not even bother finishing the dish.

I had just finished watching Interstellar before this meal so got me thinking about whether I could go back in time and not go here for dinner."}
{"text":"I came here with my family a couple of weeks ago to enjoy a dinner out together.
We usually go to little India in Toronto for Indian food, but decided to stay in the 
area instead.

The atmosphere is nice, the tables are very nicely set up but it was freezing and the back of the restaurant was lit with very harsh LED lighting that was hard on the eyes.

We were very happy with the service, the young servers were very polite and professional.
The lamb biryani that I ordered was very delicious, but the salad was very peppery and looked wilted.

Overall with a few tweaks, I would have given the restaurant a higher rating. It was missing a warm and welcoming feeling, which would have been nice."}
{"text":"Went to Agra for dinner recently and it was a fairly positive experience.  The vegetable pakora was well cooked and crispy although the chutney (I'm guessing it was mango) was kind of non-descript and they gave far too little of it.  I also wasn't impressed with the wilted salad it came with.

For mains, we had half a tandoori chicken, jumbo prawn masala, and vegetable jalfrezi with rice.  The vegetable jalfrezi was just ok and disappointingly bland.  But the prawn masala was nice and the tandoori chicken had a smokiness to it that was very pleasant.  And the basmati rice was beautifully cooked.  

Being that we were dining in the financial district, the prices aren't exactly cheap but service was polite and efficient and the food was fine based on what I had.  I'd come back here if in the neighbourhood but I wouldn't go out of my way to come back here again."}
{"text":"Am an indian and I know indian food. This food was horrible to put it politely. Very limited food options, food was cold and when I gave feedback to the staff they were rude and ignored the suggesitons.

Stay away from this one."}
{"text":"I live at Yonge and Sheppard and wanted to try something local. I ordered the butter chicken, rice and naan bread -AMAZING!  I never had butter chicken so creamy and rich, and the naan bread was too delicious.   

My partner ordered the tandoori chicken.  The tandoori chicken was yummy and flavorful, but we agreed the butter chicken was the best.  

The service was also great and I like how they bring you an appetizer when you first arrive. We got something similar to a tortilla chip with some veggies in a spicy sauce to dip.  ( Not sure what it is called but it was good) 

I plan on going again to try their lunch buffet!"}
{"text":"Yummy tandoori chicken and lamb rogan josh. Plus, they were very kind to me when I stopped in to order take out. Next time, I'll eat in. :)"}
{"text":"i came here to meet two of my friends for lunch and it was great. I had to pay for parking by the subway because it was crazy packed and busy in their lot. It was busy but not full in the restaurant and was seated right away. The server was really nice and quickly took our plates after we ate. The fresh naan was good but nothing to brag about. They do have a good option of food for both vegetarians and meat eaters. I really enjoyed their butter chicken and the vindaloo. The pakoras were great too. I always finish my indian meals with my gulab balls and it did not disappoint. It's definitely a great option if you are in the area fit lunch as it is not expensive. However i probably wouldn't go out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"This place is close and has buffet which is what we like, variety. Came for Sunday lunch. 

They have a variety of curry: chicken, beef, lamb, shrimp. They also have butter chicken and many vegetarian dishes. All the curry was good but seemed like it was from yesterday. The tandoori chicken was flavorful and not too dry. The naan was fresh and not too oily, which I liked. The rice had cilantro and other herbs in it which I didn't like. I wish they had plain rice.

I feel like they had more variety before, not much in terms of salad/fruits/dessert. I had the usual Indian \"timbit\" which is always good. I thought they had samosas before which was the main reason I came but they didn't this time. The service was okay pretty standard. Decor was dark and a bit dated. Didn't seem especially clean. Overall everything was A-OK. Unless I find a better one in the area this place will satisfy my craving for Indian curries and naan."}
{"text":"No wonder this place closed! Icame here and there was hair in our food and bugs in the curries!? We understand fruit flies are a problem in the summer but its disgusting to actually serve it to your customers! NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!"}

I only go here because of the location. There are two carts filled with several types of curries, veges, chicken, desserts. Food is OK only because there is selection. I don't think the flavours are really there and that the oil they use is not the best. I've been to better Indian restaurants in London, Ontario unfortunately.
But I'm a sucker for gulab and the ones here are good. Not sure how often I'll come back just for the gulab and rice pudding!!"}
{"text":"Hands down best butter chicken I've ever had! Everything from the saffron rice to the cheese paneer dish was absolutely stunning. Delivery was quick and free. I'm only ordering from here going forward, everything was totally perfect! No idea what the people below are complaining about. This place makes the absolute best Indian food, and we have been to plenty of restaurants in the city. Finally found our gem."}
{"text":"Got the butter chicken for takeout. I think price was $11.99 but then a 10% discount for takeout. When he asked me if I wanted naan or rice, I asked for naan and then realized I had to pay extra for that. Can't believe it doesn't even come with rice. 

There wasn't much chicken or sauce for the price I paid in my opinion.

The naan was delicious though.

I do want to try their lunch buffet."}
{"text":"I ate at Agra with a couple of friends a little while back and although the food was tasty what did me in was a creepy, crawly cockroach that ran across the table when we were about to get up to get dessert.  A COCKROACH!!!!  a gentleman that worked there saw me vigorously shaking my jacket and asked if everything was okay.  I told him what happened in a whisper as I didn't want to embarrass him in front of the other patrons.  He apologized profusely and showed me his ORKIN invoice that stated the restaurant had been sprayed the day prior.  What did we get in return for our horrible experience?  A free bottle of beer that he canceled off of our bill...THAT'S IT!  WOW!!!!  I would never go back again which is really too bad because the food was tasty. Tasty but obviously a dirty establishment!"}
{"text":"This weekend I ordered takeout from Agra and liked the quality and taste. The online menu offers some of specialty dishes that you don't find in Indian Buffets here in Toronto! It's definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Fantastic Indian food... fresh and tasteful. A broad menu with amazing flavour. Good service and reasonable prices given the excellent quality. Highly recommended from a guy who knows and loves his Indian food."}
{"text":"A group of us decided to check this place out for lunch. Now to be fair, it was during the holidays and they were short staffed but the service was non-existent, even for a buffet. We had to hound them to get a cup of tea. The stand in, son of the owner (I presume) was a bit overwhelmed and spilled water every time he poured a glass.

The food was OK. The selection wasn't huge, not when you compare it to the other Indian restaurants in the area.

A few weird points is that they had my favourite, aloo ghobi (potato cauliflower) as separate dishes, so I had to mix my own! There was no butter chicken left (and we went at 12:30) and rice.

The desserts also need work. They had various puddings but they were so sweet. I had slices of pineapple that were rock solid from the freezer. I might have succumbed to freezer burns on my upper lip.

The goat was OK but the dishes weren't pipping hot... And the naan, it could have been crispier.

I am not sure I would go again."}
{"text":"This happened awhile back..i felt the need to put it on yelp..its originally on Zomato.
Bad experience with ordering for takeout. I had ordered by phone and my total was around $38. I called beforehand if they were able to deliver the food to the area i was living in and they said yes. An HOUR later, they call us up, and say they cancelled the order because it was too far for them. HOWEVER inbetween that ! I called to ask how much the total was because they had not mentioned the amount after my order and they informed me that the driver already left and that it was on its way (BIG FAT LIARS). SO, BASICALLY WE WERE IN FULL HOPE THEY WERE COMING WITH OUR ORDER,BUT THEN THEY CANCELLED AFTER AN HOUR OF WAITING...Glad to have not tried their food though...imagine the taste of food made by a restaurant with poor customer service."}
{"text":"I'm a big indian food fan. BIG! Agra is a small little restaurant on Yonge.  They have a lunch buffet, all you can eat for $9.99. Don't be fooled by the small little buffet table, there are plenty of choices and everything is really good.  The naan bread is to die for, buttery and soft.  

The rice is good, with their different curries (they have both veggie and meaty curries), and their pakoras are pretty good as well. It can pretty busy at lunch, and there can't be more than 15 tables. But well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"We ordered curry chicken and butter chicken. They were both delicious. The only concern was how clean the place is and how well they wash their dishes. I first got a fork with some food on it, I had to ask the waitress to change it. I haven't gone back after that, I just think it was really gross to have that kind of issue."}
{"text":"Yelp brought me here to do a pre-diwali dinner for my friend.

It was maaaaad empty when we got here, aka we were the only table. We almost thought about getting up and going to Tandoori House next door, as it was a toss up between these two places.


So obviously the server was super nice to us. Though I think he saw me checking in to Yelp, so that could've been why too. But we were the only table here.

We ordered the :

1. Non Veg App Platter - 

Reshmi Kabob, Chicken Pakoras, Veggie Pakoras, Samosa, and a touch of salad.

I can't comment on the first two, because it arrived while I was washing my hands, and my friends devoured it, but they said it was amazing. The Veggie Pakoras were pretty awesome, and the Samosa was my favourite..it wasn't the typical punjabi style *thick crust* but more of what my mom makes, with a thin shell. It was awesome.


2. Prawn Tandoori - one word. YUM. So good. Portion was too small though. BUT YUM. Perfectly griller prawns (shrimps really. you don't get for real real prawns in Canada) on a bed of sizzling onions. They were perfectly juicy and amazing.

3. The Butter Chicken - so delicious. only white meat chunks. the gravy was thick and beautiful. Only complaint - the portion was too small :(

4. The Mutter Paneer - It wasn't just your standard Peas + Paneer. It was amped up with the beautiful addition of...Cashews! My 2nd favourite dish of the night. Seriously.

5. Raita + Cucumber Salad - Standard fare. When I read Cucumber Salad, I was hoping for Cachumber (sp?) salad, but it was still awesome anyways. I was the only one who ate it at the table because my friends are all carnivores.

6. Rice + Naan - awesome. You can't really ever go wrong.


Deserts:

1. Gulab Jamun - pretty good.

2. Kheer (Rice Pudding) - pretty good.

3. THE STAR OF THE WHOLE EVENING - HOMEFREAKINGMADE Kulfi. So FREAKING AMAZING. Non of that shit on a stick. This was the real real stuff the owner's wife made at home. The traditional kind, that you have to scrape with your spoon to eat. It was so good, that I took the container with me when errone was done eating and I ate it while walking around the street. For real real. This kulfi defo wasn't for play play.



The only reason I didn't give it 5 was the portion sizes. Otherwise, defo going back!

Maybe I wanna do their lunch buffet!


Oh, and super +++++++++++++++++

They comped my Kulfi and the RIce for us :)

No reason, the server just let us know with a smile!"}
{"text":"we ordered dinner for two when we stopped by. had bad experience with other buffet style indian food in the past - everything seems a lot more watered down. 

some of the stuff was good in the pre-fixe menu, some are kinda weird. i liked the tandori chicken and the lamb stew thing. grilled shrimp was mediocre. the long log of some sort  of meat was not very good. 

naan was fresh and crispy so that was a plus. had some leftovers to take home for the next day even. food is alright, not fantastic."}
{"text":"Small place with large selection. I had a dinner buffet with family. The Naan is great, so is the butter chicken. Also, don't forget to get the \"Mango Lassi\". It goes great with the buffet."}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday night with a friend and we were the only people dining at 7pm. The butter chicken and the beef korma were both pretty tasty but nothing to rave about. The service was pretty on point- always checking on us and refilling water. 

Pluses: 
- free popadoms
- heated serving bowls

Negatives: 
-terrible wine"}
{"text":"It's an average looking restaurant that could stand for an update to it's look.  Otherwise, for a buffet the food was pretty good.  I go with work colleagues for lunch occasionally and everyone is generally pretty happy with the food."}
{"text":"Terrible experience. We went there on a Saturday night and it was pretty quiet so we were seated right away but the the service was pretty slow. 

The complimentary papdum was the only decent thing on the menu. 

The food was overly seasoned, overly spicy and the naan had cloves and cloves of garlic (not even minced). Me and fam were sick for a day or two!

Never again!"}
{"text":"I went to Agra Fine Indian Cuisine for a friends birthday dinner this past Saturday. They have P parking in the rear or you can park on the street but you may have to pay for parking depending on the time you are there.  Once I made it in I found that the atmosphere was good and the menu had a good variety to choose from. I ordered the Lamb Vindaloo and the Butter Chicken with Garlic Nan and Regular Nan. The Lamb Vindaloo was pretty spicy and those who can take the heat will like this dish. I think it would be best served with rice. The Butter Chicken was really great. Only exception would be the actual chicken was a little bit dry, but the sauce was amazing especially with the Garlic Nan. I would come back just for the Butter Chicken. To those who like Indian food I would recommend that you give it a try."}
{"text":"I had dinner here last week.  I'd like to note that I do not eat Indian food often and it is not a cuisine I particularly enjoy.

I dropped by this location as the izakaya next door was full and we were hungry.  We ordered the butter chicken and tandoori chicken.  The server asked if we weren't going to order rice or naan, upon which we realized they didnt come with rice or naan.  The butter chicken was 11 or 12 dollars, a price I would expect a side would be included.  The cheapest rice was 3 dollars and the naan was 2.50 or so.  Portions (except the rice) were small but the taste was good, particulalry the butter chicken as it was slightly sweeter than my past experiences with butter chicken.  

One other thing I didn't like was how our server did not ask how the food was but whether we'd like to order more food, which felt like she was pushing us to order more.

All in all, food was good but price and service left something to be desired."}
{"text":"Food's not very good, and I think there are much better options in the area.  One of the main rice dishes here used canned fruit??  Didn't work for me.

Indian Aroma nearby does better quality curries and rice dishes."}
{"text":"Love this place. Food is amazing. Decor need a serious refresher.  Not the fastest service but acceptable. Best Indian in the Yonge and Sheppard area."}
{"text":"Agra is mainly where I go for Indian basically because it's across the street.  It's decent but not something to write home about.

Pros:
Butter Chicken is above average

Cons:
Portions are small
Don't order anything seafood

I don't crave Indian often, so I'm not a pro when it comes to Indian food.  Agra for what it is, is a decent place, but not a place you will be recommending anytime soon.

When I got there, the place was pretty empty.  Most of the time when i walk by you can see 1 or 2 tables at most with people.  Maybe I'm just passing by at the wrong times?  The staff are pretty nice and it basically saves this place from getting a 2 star rating.

I think everyone orders butter chicken when they have Indian now a days.  Agra's butter chicken is actually one of my favourites.  The gravy is exceptional.  I wish they would give more chicken for the $12 price though.  Also, nothing comes with rice or naan.  You need to order that separately.

I usually get a korma dish of some sort, be it beef or lamb.  I can really only call it average at best.  Never, under any circumstances order fish or shrimp dishes here.  These dishes are usually 13-17 dollars and the portions are laughable.  We decided to get the fish labrador.  It was $13 and we got 2 small fillets worth of fish.  These pieces were the size of a fish stick you get at the supermarket. Yikes..

Like I said, Agra is an OK place to go.  If you want to entertain guests or take a date you're trying to impress, there will be better options."}
{"text":"Agreed - the butter chicken is superb! I came here for a quick, solo, late afternoon lunch (2PM) and had their lunch buffet. It was still stocked, though (of course) not as fresh as it was at 11AM when it opens. Still, I saw them rotating the dishes, so they seem to keep it as fresh as possible. All varieties of dishes - vegetarian, beef, chicken, I may be crazy, but I think I may have seen pork too. Anyway, it's imperative to try to the Butter Chicken. Best ever."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery 
Butter chicken, beef biryani, apps
The apps were terrible and hard to tell what they even were (fritters, pakora, etc) 
Both of us also got food poisoning from it and felt awful for 2 days. Turns out, they got a bad health inspection the same few days when we ordered with a few critical items. I wouldn't recommend ever eating here"}
{"text":"A wonderful meal, the daily special, took us through a wonderful plate of appetizers, a sizzling plate of prawns, butter chicken, aloo gobi, naan and rice, then dessert.  Service a little slow (particularly at end of meal), but the food itself was sublime.  Wish we had a second stomach to complete - but brought it home instead.  Very unassuming on outside, tasty and delicious on the inside."}
{"text":"Not really a fine food/dining restaurant,

Your regular India buffet style place.. Not bad if you're looking to stuff yourself with Indian food with a bunch of co-workers and then split the bill evenly.."}
{"text":"I've purchased both delivery and pickup from this restaurant. As someone who is a bit of a butter chicken expert (haha) I decided to check out Agra thanks to the JustEat app. 
Delivery time - fast and the driver I've encountered (usually the same gentleman) is friendly. 
The food - naan is large. The butter chicken is savoury but the chunks of chicken breast are on the small side. 
Samosas are large but are different from traditional samosas I'm used to. 
Jumbo Prawn Masala - plump, juicy shrimp in a savoury gravy. Not as spicy as I'd like but still quite delicious. 
It's not the best Indian food I've had but it's good in a pinch."}
{"text":"The service is very friendly. The best items on the menu are butter chicken, lamb vindaloo, and shrimp biryani. For dessert try their mango lassi and fried sweet balls (gulab jamun). Quaint location friendly atmosphere and reasonable prices!!"}
{"text":"Their tandoori chicken and pakoras are really good.
Their bryani is really good too.
The service is really good and the people working there are really friendly. 
In terms of the place is very nice, but the washroom could do better :/
I'm just wondering why is always so empty"}
{"text":"The complimentary papadum and pickled carrots were really good. The papadum had a nice smoky flavour to it. I'm not usually a papadum fan, but I'm sold on these!

Overall, their portions of food are quite good, and the lamb korma was delicious. The naan were fresh with a light crisp to it, and the rice paired well with their curries.

I would definitely come back for more Agra Fine Indian Cuisine."}
{"text":"Small Indian restaurant, with nice decor. $11 buffet any day of the week from 11:30 am- 10:30 pm. I usually don't like buffets but the items looked very appealing. I'm not too familiar with all the Indian foods, but from my previous experience at other restaurants I've learned that Chicken Biryani is mild (my fav) and I usually need to order yogurt with Beef Vindaloo (also a fav), because I'll be on fire if I don't. 

The vegetable pakora looked very unusual. I guess those pakoras come in different forms, but the Pakora I had tried elsewhere looked something like a falafel. This one looked completely different and didn't really taste good. Also, the sauce it came with tasted like homemade Ketchup.
The service was fast and the restaurant looks neat. I'll most likely try the buffet on my next visit, as it seemed like everyone else was enjoying it.

Chicken Biryani (4/5) -mild
Beef Vindaloo (3.5/5)- uber spicy
Vegetable Pakora (2/5)- not spicy and quite bland"}
{"text":"Dropped in for a late lunch yesterday and was pleasantly surprised, especially given the negative reviews. Lamb vindaloo was reasonably spicy (not crazy, though) and had great flavour, and the naan bread was perfectly crispy in parts and chewy throughout. Complimentary pappadum and spicy pickled carrots were a cut above the usual free stuff most Indian places put out. Mulligatawny was a little lacklustre but far from terrible."}
{"text":"My favourite Indian restaurant!! The butter chicken at this place is the BEST in the city. If Indian foods were low in calories, I'd come here every other day for the lunch buffet. The selection is great and tastes amazing, but I always end up eating the butter chicken and naan only."}
{"text":"One of the best Indian food I've ever tried. We ordered  samosa, butter chicken, eggplant Rogan Josh Palak Panner . So delicious not too spicy . The rice and nan were also amazing . Fast delivery . Really happy definitely  will order again."}
{"text":"Ordered the butter chicken, saag mutton, paalak paneer, shrimp tandoori, naan and vegetable pakora. Besides the naan and shrimp were okay. Everything else was rubbish. For dessert, the kids ordered for kulfi - it was anything but. They served it hard as rocks and in plastic bowls that they had been frozen in.

And as fate would have it, the kids had to use the washroom. It was down a flight of very scary carpeted (yuck) steps. Once we got down, we found this disgusting toilet that needed an upgrade in the 80s!

I will not be back."}
