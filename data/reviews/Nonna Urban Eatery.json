{"text":"Five meals -- 5 Stars...  And looking forward to number six.  My favorite restaurant in Old Town.  Hate say what a great value it is -- because the food is absolutely fabulous, but it is nice on the wallet.  And the wait staff and chefs make it a delightfully fun place to visit.  I have recommended it to many others and all have been unanimous in their praise of the food."}
{"text":"Would give it 3 and 1/2 stars if I could. Had a nice lunch here, nothing outstanding. The service was friendly. The Nicoise salad was served with good quality canned tuna (as in Nice!), but frankly, fresh grilled tuna tastes better. One of our party of six complained about his breaded chicken dish, but took the rest of it home nevertheless. You could do far worse for an a lfresco lunch in Scottsdale's Old Town."}
{"text":"Very personal service. The food was fresh and authentic. Best meal we had while in Scottsdale.  Highly recommend the Chicken Soup--better than your mother makes!"}
{"text":"This is our new favorite local spot. The food is amazing as is the service. Everything is made fresh to order by a chef who takes great pride in his craft, so relax and expect a European style dining experience versus the usual super fast in and out, turn the tables style we're used to at most other places."}
{"text":"Lunch here was simply fabulous.  We ordered the following:  chicken Milanese w/ arugula & mashed potatoes -- tender & moist; Campanelle with a generous serving of salmon slices & asparagus -- perfect balance of lemon and cream is my favorite; and Niçoise salad with a huge serving of fresh tuna -- one of the best versions I've ever had in all my 58 years on this planet.
Meliya, thank you for such attentive service and your pretty smile.  
Do yourselves a favor and try this 2 month old addition to the Scottsdale scene.  The chefs take their craft seriously!"}
{"text":"Found Nonna's while on our annual trip to AZ for spring training and really glad we did. Had a wonderful dinner one night and stopped by for desert another night. Recently opened by a husband and wife team. Dinner was great, wife had a nicely balanced bolognese with tagliatelle. Nice mix of meat and good depth to the sauce(not too bright or sweet). I had a well cooked ossobucco. Meat was pull apart but not mushy.
Staff was great and remembered us on our second visit.
Can't wait to visit them again next year."}
{"text":"My husband and I wanted to go somewhere new and came across this little gem. Tucked in a little alcove off of Main St. is a quaint restaurant that is going to be a place that I frequent very often in the future. We came during the soft opening. Tess was a great waitress. She explained the menu and the story about how the restaurant came to be. My husband had the sashimi and I had the salmon and pasta. Yummy! For dessert we had the chocolate and raspberry mousse. Decadent!"}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Very personable staff and interesting menu!  Chocolate and Ricotta Flourless Cake is outstanding!  Nice additional touches including a palette cleaner serving of watermelon brought out on the house.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Came to this restaurant very excited to try! We sampled many things off the menu and each one was amazing! We finished our dinner with the most delicious tiramisu. I will definitely be back and would recommend to anyone who is looking for a great place to dine with great service! Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great service, great food, and great Chef. Very enjoyable experience all the way around. Our waitress was very attentive without going overboard. We walked in later in the evening the day of their grand opening. You could tell the staff was tired but that did not keep them from being very welcoming. You could tell it was important to them that we had a great experience - and we did! Highly recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"We found this place on yelp and the food looked fantastic!  It is a cute and quaint spot.  On Fridays they have $5 bubbly.  So we headed there after golf and sat down at 8:30 pm.  The fools coming out was mouthwatering.  We had some bubbly and kept waiting, and waiting.  Well at 10 pm they came out to say they forgot to put our order in!  So they gave us a cheese board and vegetable lasagna as compensation.  I will go back as the staff was great, the food looked sumptuous and our cheese board and vegetable lasagna, although not what we ordered, was still great."}
{"text":"The food and service was amazing!  The patio is dog friendly and staff was extremely attentive to our dogs."}
{"text":"I ate dinner on New Years eve after it had been open only two days. The food and service was excellent. I especially enjoyed the Burrata Parmigiana which was amazing. The wine selection by the glass was also very good and reasonably priced. Save room for the desert sampler.
The couple who own this are hands on and it will no doubt be a great success."}
{"text":"We are so happy that Chef Gian Franco and Valentina are back in town. We had an outstanding dining experience this past Friday.  We love sitting at the bar to dine so there is ample opportunity to chat with staff and hear about some culinary creations that Chef may have in mind. Speaking of which, my wife had what I would call the most creative vegetable lasagna ever. Absolutely fantastic dish. Layers of complexity and flavors. I had handmade campanelle with a light cream sauce, salmon and asparagus. Awesomeness on a plate.

So our happy place is open and as usual, we walk away satisfied with smiles on our faces. I posted a photo of the lasagna. Go and try it yourself. Paired nicely with a Pinot Noir.  Bonus a petite."}
{"text":"The food was delicious!!!! I loved the selection on the menu. The server was excellent and they had had a $5 glass for bubbles. We sat on the patio and enjoyed the great weather."}
{"text":"Driving around looking at Yelp resulted in lunch at Nonna.  Luckily there was a sign on the sidewalk pointing us back to their location because it was a little tough to find.  It's a cute little place with a bunch of tables, open kitchen and small bar.  They make their own pasta which was a pleasant surprise to say the least.  We tried the tagliatelle bolognese  and a burrata/eggplant dish both were incredible.  The menu is small but they seem to have it all covered - excellent pasta, seafood lovers, veggie peeps and everyone in between. 

Service is personal, it was just the two cooking/serving at lunch and it was incredibly efficient despite having a few tables occupied. We dine out quite a bit but I haven't tried a place this great in a long long time.  Don't miss out!!!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant in Old Town Scottsdale. The food was delicious!! My friend had the chicken Milanese and I had the Rigatoni pasta that they make in house. The ambiance and decor is amazing. Very welcoming place, the staff and the owner are very friendly and made the hole experience even better. Great place for good food or just for drinks. Don't waste time - try this out you'd probably plan on coming back. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Tucked away from the hustle and bustle of the main streets in old town Nonna provided great atmosphere and unique cooked to order food. A very nice selection of food and drinks that remind you of a special home cooked meal. 
A special thanks to our servers Malia and Jodie they were great and attentive and brought out a water bowl for our puppy. 

We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The house Trofie Pesto Genovese (pasta spirals with green beans, potatoes and a light fresh basil) is prepared to perfection with light Crissy green beans and cubed potatoes. The homemade pasta is delightfully tasty and the dish could be eaten hot or cold  No need to add anything, perfect the way it's prepared."}
{"text":"Great ambience. My pasta was just okay. My wife really enjoyed hers so that's why 4 stars"}
{"text":"Bored while shopping with my wife at Nordstroms, I decided to look for restaurants nearby and found this gem. Tucked into old town Scottsdale on Main St my wife and I were pleasantly surprised. Their Burrata salad was outstanding. My wife and I could have gone for a second order. My entre the Chicken Milanesa was excellent. Most of the time these meats are pounded down and dry.  Not the case here. Excellent breaking and the chicken was juicy.  The 3 waitresses were great, very helpful, fun and friendly. This will be a regular stop for us.  Did I mention we loved the cozy, homey not glitzy ambience."}
{"text":"Wonderful place to eat and drink! Owner served us and she is amazing!! Food is so fresh and delicious! A must in Scottsdale! Service is phenomenal. Can't say enough great stuff about this place."}
{"text":"Tasty, fresh and good service!  What more can one ask for?  I had fresh pasta with salmon, my guest had the poke.  Loved it and will be back with our visitors."}
{"text":"Seriously so good! Everything we had was really great! We had the capanelle, Bolognese pasta (that's cooked for seven hours), squid ink pasta, octopus appetizer and the burrata and all was really great! We will definitely be back. Also, the service was great too- very friendly staff! Good job guys :)"}
{"text":"Hidden gem you owe it to yourself to sit at the bar and order everything 

Friday is $5 bubble day - cava or prosecco 

The chef was awesome. Food was like the best home cooked meal you've ever had. Great food, really nice waitstaff, and a cool setting. 


Go check it out! 

We'll be going back for sure!"}
{"text":"Really wonderful restaurant! The restaurant is small, welcoming and an intimate atmosphere. Great date night location. Staff was incredibly friendly and inviting and the food was delicious. We had the octopus, which was so tender and flavorful. My husband had the Bolognese which was very good and I had the campanelle was absolutely amazing!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious, priced right. I had the Tagliatelle bolognese made fresh daily. Soooo good and the staff treat you like family."}
{"text":"Great food, service, and ambience!

During our first weekend as residents of Arizona, we stopped by old town & Nonna's. As it was a spontaneous stop, we did not have reservations. However, we were seated almost immediately in the outdoor area.

The waitress (I wish I remembered her name) was very sweet and told us all about the area. She told us about different neighborhoods, local attractions, and even the real estate market! 

As we stopped in after dinner, we just ordered few cocktails and appetizers. Everything was delicious! 

Can't wait to be back! We're loving Arizona and the friendly crowd!"}
{"text":"This was hands down the best meal we had in Scottsdale on our stay. The food was delicious, the menu is local and seasonal and changes all the time which keeps it interesting. And if you get a chance sit in Stacey's section.  She made what was already an awesome meal into an even more fun and awesome experience.  Thanks you guys"}
{"text":"This was my second time at Nonna and I'm as equally impressed as my first interaction! Excellent wine list, friendly family-like people, an open kitchen to watch all of the action, and some of the best food in Scottsdale. This really is a hidden gem. You walk into the Old West part of Scottsdale and in a back hidden corner is Nonna. We indulged in some of the creamiest burrata I've ever had atop roasted eggplant and tomato, fresh shaved prosciutto and melon, octopus grilled to perfection with a chorizo mash, and THE BEST risotto I have ever tasted. It was a fantastic bite of perfectly cooked, buttery, mushroom-y, fresh shaved truffle-y goodness. Don't miss out on the chance to give it a try. Some other favorites of a past visit were the ahi sashimi and the bolognese.  Love it!"}
{"text":"I had dinner here a few weeks ago, and although it was Ok, it was nothing special.  We were quickly seated by the staff.  This is NOT a 4 or 5 star restaurant - period.  I don't care what other Yelpers say, they tend to over rate places.  There are no white table linens, fine cutlery or service that you will find outstanding.  It's not like Vegas or NYC.  This is a very casual restaurant and you sit literally in the kitchen.  You're not too far from the dishwasher!  You'll see what I mean.

We ordered the home made tagliatelle alla bolognese to be split between us.  It was OK, but unremarkable.  I've had a lot better.  We ordered a dessert, which was good, but I don't see it on the menu now and I can't remember much about it, so it must not have impressed me enough to do so.

Overall, try this restaurant and see how you feel. Others have highly rated it.  I don't see it. Still, it may be worth a try."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend for lunch and was really excited to see that it was $5 bubbles Friday! We were alone with the exception of another party of two. We were welcomed when we walked in the door but it took quite a while after we sat down to get a drink order. We ordered the cheeseboard to start and each of us had a bubbly. The drinks took a really long time. I would have been overjoyed to have water until the champagne could arrive. The cheese board had some really good cheese on it but aside from the long bread sticks there was one graham cracker, split in half. We ended up asking for some more of the bread and olive oil so we could have something to eat it with. It wasn't all cheese that could be eaten as a slice, some was crumbly and some creamy so it felt slightly awkward to eat with an almond or a blueberry but they were all good. After our cheese board came out, we didn't see the waitress again until I was annoyed enough to ask for the check. I wanted to order one of the homemade pasta dishes. When she did come over she asked if we would like more to drink and in my head I thought...20 minutes ago. I asked for the check and we had lunch elsewhere. Too bad because the ambiance was great and I bet the pasta would have been really good."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere, & friendly service.  We sat right next to the open kitchen - cool to see the chef's working."}
{"text":"Amazing food, real authentic Italian style! Great for a date night. Everything is very fresh."}
{"text":"Ellen and I ate a superb lunch for the first time at Nonna Urban Eatery, but certainly not the last. It is one of the very best new additions to Old Town Scottsdale!

She had the veggie omelette with mozzarella, available only on weekends, and I had the chicken Milanese. Upon arrival at our table, the dishes looked like delicious works of art!

Our superb server was Valentina, co-owner and a smart, enthusiastic dynamo who told us about appealing upcoming additions to their offerings. She is a great spokesperson for Nonna Urban Eatery. The chef and co-owner, Gian Franco Brugaletta, graciously came around to check on our experience. His passion for food was infectious and we were lucky to be among his diners. 

In addition to tantalizing food choices, Nonna's also has a wide selection of beverage choices. Ellen enjoyed their wine, and I enjoyed one of their Arizona-brewed craft beers. 

Nonna Urban Eatery is warm and inviting. Their food is excellent. Service is terrific. We're looking forward to returning to this gem!"}
{"text":"To start the Owners are very nice.  She came to our table and explain which items on the menu or gluten free.  We ordered the halibut ceviche which was A party for my taste buds.  I almost ordered two but then realized would like to try something else on their menu.  My wife ordered the swordfish and I ordered the chicken.  The food was very savory.  I really enjoyed dining experience at this restaurant.  By far one of the best restaurants in Scottsdale Arizona we ate at it this weekend."}
{"text":"Checked out the background of chef Gian Franco, sounds very solid and exciting!"}
{"text":"Great little place - had awesome craft local beers, cheese plate. Great afternoon spot to chill out."}
{"text":"Fabulous- here on business and found this gem on Yelp and very glad we did. There were seven of us and were seated immediately with no reservation since it was a quiet Tuesday. The service was warm and friendly and the food excellent. Shout out for the tagliatelle bolognese and the chicken Milanese. We also enjoyed the burrata salad and the chocolate mousse cake

If I lived here I would be a regular!"}
{"text":"This husband/wife new entrant into the Scottsdale market is as good as it gets.  Fresh, with impeccable attention to detail, I promise you will be impressed and satisfied.  So glad we found it!"}
{"text":"Wow!!! Just finished an amazing lunch! The greatest service and ambience and of course the food was incredible. Fresh ingredients and got to see our meals prepared in the kitchen. Feel so lucky to stumble upon this jewel of a place. We will always come back. Please swing in a treat yourself to an amazing culinary experience."}
{"text":"Great ambiance... great service and more importantly family owned and the chef makes incredible food.  This is a must visit place... hidden gem..."}
{"text":"Amazing evening! We loved every bite, from the prosciutto (teenager) to vegan soup, chicken to kale pasta. Completely yummy and a delightful hostess, to boot! Dont miss this place!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful evening with friends. Lovely, quaint restaurant. Excellent service and food. Chef's wife is exceedingly accommodating. Would give five stars if bread and portion sizes were more in line with price."}
{"text":"My husband and I stumbled upon this complete gem here in Old Town, when we wanted to just try some place new. Wow, was this quaint and personable restaurant a breath of fresh air! The cocktails are completely one-of-a-kind original. I enjoyed a guava cocktail that rocked my world. For dinner I ordered the 4 mushroom risotto that was beyond savory and comforting- everything I wanted and more! This dish begged for a nice glass of wine (try their Pinot noir here!). My husband ordered the halibut with grilled veggies, which really hit the spot as he was getting over a cold. I don't even think I got to try it because he enjoyed it so much. Needless to say, I was hoping to go there today, but they are closed until later in August (typical, authentic Italian chef- closed for the August holidays). All in all, I can't wait to return when it reopens so that I can explore more of their menu! Ooohhh, also did I mention that the acoustics are perfect there as well, not rowdy at all. I could actually carry on a quality conversation with my husband without shouting at him- what a relief! Perfect intimate date night with a fresh and distinctive menu that will get you out of a food rut. Enjoy and salute!"}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try Nonna for a long time and when tasked with picking a spot for a double date, I thought that would be the perfect opportunity! The ambiance is so adorable and they have a quaint patio with strung lights and simple, modern decor. We really enjoyed sitting outside while our evening weather is still nice! 

To start, we split a cheese platter and the burrata and eggplant salad. Both were delicious and perfect to split between the 4 of us. For my entree, I went classic and ordered their bolognese with homemade pasta. They make all of their pasta in house and once I heard that, my mind was set! You can't beat fresh pasta. Their wine and beer selections were nice - a little on the pricey end but still pretty tasty! 

All in all, we really enjoyed our experience here. Friendly service {a TAD slow at times but that was no big deal since we were chatting away}, and the prices seemed affordable for the portion sizes and quality of ingredients used. I would recommend this to a friend errrrr fellow Yelper any day! It is a cute date spot, too!"}
{"text":"Five star food, five star service. Our second time in here and it was better than the last. So far we've had their cheese plate, burrata and eggplant, salmon pasta, bolognese, and chicken Milanese. Great HH, $5 glasses of bubbles on Friday. Their staff is so so friendly and relatable. Ask for Tess! It's a small kind of hidden gem located in an alley/courtyard in old town. They've been open a year and I don't know why it's taken us so long to find them. Do yourselves a favor and come here!"}
{"text":"My parents came from out of town Friday night and we decided to go to Nonna for dinner. We called ahead for reservations but unfortunately they said no reservations for small parties but ensured us not a very long wait. We got there around 8pm and we got sat down right away. The host sat us down by the bar we had a lovely dinner. We decided to first enjoy the $5 bubbly special, followed by the eggplant mozzarella, tagliatelle and veggie lasagna. Everything was delicious but our favorite was the eggplant mozzarella. Before dessert my parents ordered sambuca and we received a small side of a similar liquor for us to try. Afterwards we finished our dinner with the butter cake! So yummy!! Needless to say we had an amazing time and dinner and I will be back soon and then again once my parents are in town. I would recommend Nonna who wants to have an intimate and delicious dinner."}
{"text":"Delightful lunch on the patio. Salmon, fresh asparagus, homemade pasta  entree with lemon cream sauce and iced tea.we came back the next day and it was fabulous again with great service."}
{"text":"From me John Namisnak: This is wonderful place for early eats & light dinner! Came here on the closed monday for wine tasting!  Chef had lots of fun snacks & cheeses & sushi for a large rose tasting with Young's market!"}
{"text":"What an absolutely amazing hidden little gem in Old Town Scottsdale!  We stopped in for dinner on Saturday night and were so impressed with the entire experience - great ambiance, super friendly staff and truly amazing food!  We shared the arancini, proscuitto and melon, the bolognese, the chicken milanese and the peach crostada - all so fresh and flavorful.  I enjoyed a nice glass of Sauvignon Blanc and my husband enjoyed a beer.  It was a reasonably priced and truly tasty dinner!  We will definitely be back and can't wait to experience more of this delightful menu."}
{"text":"Man, what a disappointment!  4.5 star Yelp rating, you let me down.  Came on a Tuesday night and there wasn't another patron up to the time we left around 730p.  Perhaps this area is geared more towards daytime tourists?  All the nearby shops were closed by 7p. Needless to say, we found street parking easily since there weren't many people around.  Whoever classified this as \"tapas\" on Yelp is misleading.  Tapas are meant to be shared, and although the dishes here are small, they are too pricey to facilitate such activity.

Yellowtail sashimi $18 - 6 pieces of seared fish.  They were ok, very salty.
Pan seared halibut with tomato ratatouille $22 - Ok
Scottsdale Blonde $6
Tiramisu $10 - This was my favorite of the night!  Still not worth $10, though.

{"text":"Stopped in for appetizers between visits to tasting rooms. Service was excellent!  Loved the food, as well.  We shared the cheese plate (which was beautifully presented), arrancini, and melon with prosciutto."}
{"text":"We came in for the first time and the whole dinning experience was absolutely fantastic. We had a glass of Sangiovese wine and Prosecco. Then a Prosciutto Bruschetta. At the end of our meal we were given a piece of watermelon how great is that.
Gian Franco Brugaletta was the Chef and his wife were great host. I will be back to get more of this place."}
{"text":"The food was exceptional. Aranci appetizer filled with melted fontina. Campanelle pasta and salmon was creamy and filling. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Nonna Urban Eatery is a small Mom & Pop restaurant that offers a daily changing global menu.  On the day I went it was mostly Italian with home made hand crafted pastas and they offered several Asian Dishes with raw fish. The dining room is mostly classic looking but very open and bright during the day. Dinners can view the open kitchen.

If the Cucumber Lollipops are on the menu YOU MUST GET THEM! because they are AMAZING! They are made of raw Tuna, Yellow Tail, Salmon and a little avocado wrapped in the thinnest cucumber on a stick shaped like a lollipop. They taste incredible! A small pile of peppery greens dressed in a zippy ginger dressing concludes the plate and it goes together like magic. Bravo! One of the best things I tried all year!

We also shared the House Made Campanelle Pasta with Salmon and Asparagus. The pasta was made nice, the sauce was lemony...asparagus was fresh....fish had a nice sear.....leek was a nice touch..... but I wouldn't get this plate again because the fish tasted slightly fishy but not bad. I also thought it needed one more flavor...maybe just a pinch of saffron or just a fresh herb.

Our server was very friendly and helpful and even suggested a local museum to visit.

It's possible to pass this restaurant by even being on Main St. because it's located in a tiny Micro Mall of a few shops that are in a cluster near the end of the street.

You come here for a unique menu that you won't find anywhere else!

Tons of Potential Here! Because the Cucumber Lollipops really rocked!"}
{"text":"Impeccable service; great food. Would go back again. Very fresh, obviously local inspired. Nice evening."}
{"text":"Thanks to help, as out of Towner's we stumbled upon Noona on a Friday night. Luckily it wasn't crowded around 7pm and  table of 5 were able to sit at the high chairs. Service was a tad bit slow since they only had two servers for the whole night also manning the bar. However this place was classy, quaint and hipster.

Here's the quick low down:
-smoked salmon and quinoa: I could do without. We had this as an appetizer and it was pretty basic. The portion is small and nothing stood out from this dish. 
-edamame: standard and nothing memorable. I ordered these to hold my appetite down since I was starving.
-hamachi neck: YESSSSSS. We were told that the chef buys a certain amount (2?) of fresh hamachi on various days and the night we came, they had only one left. We ordered it and it was out of this world. It sounds weird but it was juicy, tender and flavorable. The veggies that accompanied it were also a great pairing with the hamachi. I highly recommend. 
-Tagliatelle Bolognese: Good combo of flavors and the pasta was excellent. 
-Chicken milanese: I liked the breaded chicken and this dish was filling. 
-creamy salmon: Pretty basic and simple. 

Overall great place to mingle, wine and dine and share eats with friends."}
{"text":"This place is an absolute GEM! Small and intimate, it's very inviting and perfect for a date night. My boyfriend and I decided to try this spot Saturday night for dinner and between the delicious cocktails and incredible fresh pasta, I can say this spot will quickly become the best Italian in Old Town.
The owner was completely lovely and spent time at our table chatting, making us feel more like old friends than new customers.
The salmon cream pasta is perfection, with fresh asparagus and perfectly cooked pasta (which is made on site). Make sure you finish your evening with a delightful glass of Limoncello and you're night will be complete!
Highly recommend, I can say we will be regulars in no time!"}
{"text":"Tried a bit of everything here at Nonna! The appetizers (eggplant, tomato & burrata was my favorite) were delicious!! The main courses definitely did not disappoint (try the pastas they are all incredible) & finally the dessert of tiramisu was to die for! This place was modern & different ! the owners are wonderful! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Nonna Urban Eatery is a hidden gem in Old Town Scottsdale. The food is excellent, and so is the service. Our server was very engaged and attentive. Seek this place when you're in Scottsdale and you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Sushi and Italian well done, quaint spot off the main strip so you can enjoy quiet peaceful meal before going big.  Had the Bolognese, yellow tail, seafood pasta, and the salmon pasta at our table, all exceptional.  Fun owners operators!"}
{"text":"Yep, the reviews are for real. The place is outstanding. I had a pasta dish with salmon, and it was truly delicious. They make their own with a pasta machine they proudly display. I also came for lunch and kept it simple with a tuna Niçoise salad. That was excellent as well. Even the iced tea, which I am pretty picky about, was fantastic. Valentina, the owner, is lovely, and her waitstaff is attentive and friendly. This is a can't miss hidden gem."}
{"text":"Nice new family owned Italian food in the heart of old town.  They really make you feel welcome and the food is sooo good"}
{"text":"There is a reason this either he has five stars. The food was outstanding. Don't forget to have the four cheese flatbread."}
{"text":"Outstanding. The prosciutto and melon was the best I've had since Italy. The pasta is handmade every day and menu changes each week. I had the fusilli and my wife had the pappardelle. Both wonderful. The service was attentive and friendly. Try to sit at two tables near kitchen so you can watch the chef and staff prepare the food."}
{"text":"The food is really good but the servings were small for the price range.  Plan on waiting time. Overall was really good"}
{"text":"Good quality food. We enjoyed the charming quite patio dinner under the stars with friends. Delicious"}
{"text":"Whenever the owner is cooking there's a great chance the food will be significantly better than all the other places in the neighborhood.  You can taste the passion in the food.  Pasta made fresh every morning.  Really delightful."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! Wonderful and friendly staff and the food was incredible! Will definitely be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"I loved this restaurant from the cute location in Old Town to the casual and yet with-it decor.  We started with the freshly sliced prosciutto.  We had the tagliatelle bolognese which was tasty like it came directly from Bologna.  My daughter had the grilled salmon which was delicious.  The owner and the waitress were friendly and genuine.  This is a great restaurant."}
{"text":"Had dinner here and sat outside. The bruschetta was amazing, service was very good and the entrees were delicious as well. A very nice find and would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"If Zero were a choice..that would be the score for my entire party of 4..I had the Octopus special with dessert.$42..the piece of octopus was 2 inches long and cold..the mushrooms were less than a tablespoon in diameter..the Pumpkin Dessert was so awful.. no one would eat it..  one person had the clam pasta.. about 20 very small claims, 1/2 of the shells were empty..the drinks were average, nothing special...the service was awful...slow is an understatement...long wait for everything.... drinks and  cheese tray appetizer...then the check, when we finally got it, there was a $120.00 error... waitress with an attitude, and one shared bathroom with NO soap..never, ever again!.left hungry and feeling totally ripped off..."}
{"text":"Came here after one of the spring training games (GO GIANTS).  Our waitress Tess was extremely pleasant.  The 3 of us split our dishes and each and everyone one of them were delicious.  The miso cod was perfectly cooked.  The chicken Milanese was lightly breaded and moist. The arugula and tomatoes provided the right amount of flavor as it comes with no sauce. The pasta dish with creamy salmon and asparagus was really delicious.  Sometimes cream pasta dishes can be too heavy but this was perfect.

The only negative is we don't live in Arizona and not able to come back anytime soon!"}
{"text":"Fabulous little place off the beaten path!  


Friendly and helpful service made us feel right at home.  Everything off the eclectic menu is made to order, and it shows. Each of our 3 dishes were fresh and perfectly prepared. Prices are very reasonable, and the atmosphere is great for everything from an intimate date to dinner with family. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Nonna is an EXCELLENT restaurant! Wonderful food, drinks and service.  The staff is very friendly and very knowledgeable regarding the menu and wines. Nonna is the type of place that can educate you on  any wine you are interested in. The atmosphere is so relaxing and fun. Nonna is located in the middle of Old Town with indoor and patio seating. It's a very clean restaurant. It's a great place to bring your family, have date night or just want to have a quiet place to have dinner and/or drinks. I highly recommend Nonna Urban Eatery to everyone. It's one of my favorite places to eat when I'm in town."}
{"text":"Came for what I thought were tapas. Anyway we ordered some arepas. The chef gladly offered to make them vegetarian. He put a ratatouille inside the corn meal sandwich like tort. It lacked in any seasoning whatsoever. No salt or herbs and the cornmeal was underdone! Gummy inside. To top it off, it came with a side salad and half of the lettuce was black and rotten. I did mention that and they took $5 off the plate which was $17! We also shared a beet arugula salad. It came with a salty white cheese, dates, pistachio and balsamic dressing. The salad was decent and it saved the day. However, it was just so so. The chef did apologize for the lettuce. Still we both left hungry. It's a pretty little place, but a touch pricey. If the arepas were done and seasoned I think I would have bumped the stars up a notch."}
{"text":"Went here for a date and it was PHENOMENAL! Great service, cute patio, amazing food (I got the salmon pasta and my boyfriend got the linguine). We split the chocolate raspberry mousse cake and got a salad & the spicy tuna & rice for the appetizer. All of it, amazing."}
{"text":"Tried this place on a whim after stumbling on the Yelp reviews, and I'm sure glad we did. This was one of the best meals I've had anywhere, especially at this price point. Definitely worth gushing over. I literally wanted to sit and replay the entire meal experience. For whatever reason we had the place to ourselves, which was amazing. We sat right next to the cooking area and were able to chat with the sous chef while she worked. She was very friendly and talked about the restaurant, food, and menu.
My overall impression of this restaurant was that they truly understood the concept of \"slow food\". My husband and I were there for an hour and a half and had 2 appetizers and an entree apiece. I watched them prepare one dish from beginning to end and then start the next one. I know there would have been more going on if there had been more customers, but I'm sure the style of prep wouldn't have changed much.
Our first order was the meat and cheese plate. First of all, it was so well put together that it looked like a work of art. I suddenly understood why people take pictures of their food. There were 4 different cheeses, a variety of crackers, and fruit. I was particularly impressed by the Bleu cheese as I don't typically like bleu cheese but I loved this one, especially with the fruit. The next appetizer was a breaded rice ball filled with tomato sauce. It sounds strange but it really worked. For entrees we had the grouper with mashed potatoes and vegetables (him), and the campanelle with salmon and asparagus (me). The homemade campanelle was fantastic with the dish. All of the portion sizes were reasonable, not huge, but not skimpy either.
The restaurant itself was simple but tasteful. There was interesting music but it wasn't too loud, and the sous chef actually asked us if it was ok before she turned on the blender (she was making homemade Cesar dressing).
If I could change anything about this restaurant, I would add a suggestion for some sort of chef's choice meal where you pick a number of dishes and just let the chef go to town. Also, some sort of event where you can try the dishes they're testing and fine tuning. They were experimenting with some sort of cheese and pasta dish yesterday that looked like it would be delicious. I guess we'll have to make the trek across town again soon to see if it shows up on the menu."}
{"text":"A real find. A hole in the wall in Old Town that delivers nothing but tasty fair.  We were four. Started with the Burrata cheese,the Edamomi and  each were prepared very well.   For our entries we had the the Bolognese, the seafood pasta  



My only complaint was that the bread that they served wasn't warm.  A small price to pay for such a delicious"}
{"text":"Maybe handling the 2 large tables of people who ordered right before us impacted our experience?  

Inside the restaurant it was very warm (open kitchen shares the same room as the inside tables) so we elected to sit outside.  The outdoor space was quiet, located back from the street.  The wait staff was friendly and they shared the responsibility of the tables.     Perhaps that's necessary in such a small restaurant but it became confusing when we would ask for something from one person and shortly after that another server would come by and ask if everything was ok.   We would then repeat our request letting them know we had already asked someone.   
 
As for the food.....  The Burrata Parmigiana Eggplant dish was very good but a little salty.      The Salmon Pasta dish was also very good - tender pasta with a slight 'bite' and lightly coated with lemony sauce, but the asparagus was sparse.     My husband's Vegetable Lasagna, although light and flavorful was closer to room temperature than hot.    It came with a smear of red sauce on the plate so he asked for more and they brought him a small amount of cold (i.e. out of the refrigerator cold) sauce.  

I mentioned the $10 off for the Yelp check-in (yeah!) when we sat down, and later when we asked for the bill, but the first version we received did not reflect the savings so I had to get it corrected."}
{"text":"Fantastic place and nice change from the usual. Me and my girl stopped at lunchtime for a Niçoise salad and a plate of delicious pasta and shrimp. Super nice people"}
{"text":"The pasta! Get the pasta! My fiancé and I decided to have dinner here during our staycation in Old Town and we're both glad we did. I chose those place because I was being indecisive and couldn't decide what I wanted for dinner and they had multiple options. This place serves Italian dishes as well as Japanese dishes. I know it seems weird. I though the same thing too, but we couldn't decide what type of food we wanted so we chose a restaurant with both options. But BOTH are amazing! I ordered the Lollipop roll and my fiancé ordered their most popular pasta dish and both were so good I couldn't stop saying \"mmmm\" after every bite. I do wish their pasta portion was bigger though. We definitely wanted more and probably could've eaten double what we were given. Although, we did share. I do think I alone could've eaten double though.  

We also sat at the bar and got to talk a little with one of the waitresses and the co-owner. They were so friendly and great at recommending dishes, explaining anything on the menu, etc. They even gave us some recommendations for nearby restaurants and bars to check out on our staycation. It's tucked away in a little corner and it's a small restaurant but definitely worth the visit."}
{"text":"We eat out just about every evening in this beauty city we call home. We have walked passed the Nonna restaurant and finally decided to go check it out! AMAZING food! The owner was beyond gracious for us coming in and you could tell the true passion he had for food! Definitely a must go in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Such a great hidden spot in Old town. Great vibe and excellent food. Went here with friends late Friday night and loved it. We had the burrata to start, the eggplant was a tasty and unexpected addition. We split the homemade pappardelle pasta and risotto both were great! Loved this place, wasn't super loud and made you feel like you were at someone's home, will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"The food and service were excellent. Note to owners, I do not think you will be in business next year if you do not solve your entry problem. The rope across the entry aisle makes it appear you were not open. During lunch, we watched people walk up and turn away. One of our party spotted someone working inside, but we actually asked if you were open because no one was inside. It was during lunch hour too."}
{"text":"A wonderful restaurant in every sense possible! The chef uses only fresh produce. The home made pasta is simply delicious. The salmon and chicken dishes are so flavoursome. They have just opened so will be adding to the menu soon but don't miss out on their daily special. Very reasonably priced especially for the quality. 
This will become a regular destination...and the blueberry or coffee beer is a must!v You"}
{"text":"Looking for something a little different, we found this on Yelp and shared a salmon salad and a prosciutto and melon plate.  

Along with excellent service, delicious bread with oil, we had a light and unique lunch. If I lived in Scottsdale, this would certainly be a regular stop. Out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"Went to Nonna's last night (Saturday) for an early dinner. What a splendid surprise! Can't wait to take my grown children there next time they're in town. We sat at a table right by the kitchen and interacted with the charming husband and wife team. The husband is Italian and clearly the head chef. The wife is right there beside him, though, preparing delicious food. Additionally there is a great soul chef. We both had the lobster farro risotto with enoki mushrooms. I as amazed at how much lobster this moderately priced dish contained. It was a real treat. The space is charming. The service would be improved by the addition of another wait person but they kept up reasonably well. We got a hug from the wife before we left. Great experience!"}
{"text":"This place is extraordinary.  The Chef is a culinary master of multiple genres, with every dish reflecting worldly expertise.  The staff is familial, warm and engaging.  With pleasant atmosphere, great location, and incredible food above all - this place is one of our top favorites in Old Town!  :)"}
{"text":"Ummmm..........so ya. This place is MIND BLOWING.   So, so good. Incredible food done by a chef that obviously knows what he's doing!!!  My picture of his yellowtail sashimi dish speaks for its self, and the salmon and asparagus pasta couldn't be more perfect!"}
{"text":"I chose this place because of high ratings and its ambiance. I could see the chefs at work which was cool but unfortunately that's where it ends and the food it didn't meet my expectation. 
Ww ordered lobster and carne asada, the waitress said it's a lobster tail but there was a bit of lobster in the dish. Carne asada had no taste and just had a some refried beans on the side and very very pricey."}
{"text":"Good food, cute decor, dim lighting for ambience. The food is good but a little pricy. I guess thats standard for old town Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Fabulous!  Came here with friends who made arrangements for a dinner party of 20, so we had a set menu and for the price point I was so excited to try this place because I have heard such good things.  I will say I would of never ordered a few of the items on our set menu and I am so glad I tried them.  
1st - Salmon with shaved veggies tossed in the house vinaigrette paired with the Montsantis Rose Cava, Spain -  the wine was Awesome!!!  Just a tad too much salmon for me but if you are a salmon lover this is your salad.
2nd - Traditional Sicilian Arancini - which is Italian Rice Balls and I would of never have ordered them from the menu.  They were delicious - can't wait to go back and order them again. Paired with Sur Sur Grillo Sicily, Italy wine - this wine was okay the Rose Cava still my fav.
3rd - Nonna Handmade Tagliatelle Bolognese - ummmmm CIAO/HELLO! This dish was simply divine.  The flavors in this dish is making my mouth water as I am writing this review.  The fact they make their own pasta just takes this dish to a new level.  I was happy I had left overs so I could have for lunch the next day.  This was paired with Terre De Trinci Sangiovese Umbira, Italy.  Great combo!
Last but not least the Chef's Dessert Assortment - I really thought I died and went to dessert heaven - it was a total surprise that we 3 different desserts and they made one for each of us to try.  REALLY?  They had chocolate chocolate ball which was rich and delightful...perfect with coffee, then she brought out this strawberry parfait concoction and finally and my favorite the mandarin orange individual pie.  The presentation was simply beautiful the colors and all the season fruits made this a great dining experience.   

Establishment:  it's a little hard to find as it's tucked away from Main St. thank goodness they have a Nonna's sign to point you to their restaurant.  Best to park in the parking structure next to Mission/Los Olivos and just walk it's free. Nonna's is small they do have patio seating but once it gets hot -summer time the seating will be limited.  

Can't wait to come back.  Loved it!"}
{"text":"We had the Campanelle , creamy salmon sauce and asparagus for $16. It is to die for! The pasta is homemade, perfect and the sauce is incredible. The asparagus are very small and tender and cut to look like small green beans!  Not to mention the salmon, fresh as can be. This is a great find!!!!"}
{"text":"So impressed with this intimate little restaurant. They make all pasta in house, I highly recommend the Campanelle."}
{"text":"I just stumbled across this gem while walking in Oldtown Scottsdale. Only open one week my plan is to become one of their first regulars. I had smoked salmon carpaccio w fennel salad and Arancini, both were excellent! You have to check this place out the owners are amazing and the food is awesome!"}
{"text":"I absolutely enjoy the gourmet dishes that momma has to offer. I'm a vegetarian, and I highly recommend the mushroom Faroe risotto.. the ambience is very nice, esp for a weekend brunch"}
{"text":"Great get away spot a little hard to find but well with it
Had a tuna poke bowl \"outstanding \"
We also shared a vegetarian pasta with Smokey tomato sauce and Tuesday's have 16 oz beers $4
It's all star restaurant very reasonably priced
A must go to"}
{"text":"Okay, this place is fabulous!  
The menu has incredible variety, yet it's all on one page! I personally don't trust a place with too long of a menu! the menu changes seasonally, which means you'll always have a bit of a surprise next time you're in.
They don't try to be fancy pants, which makes them \"all that!\"  They are deliciously unique.  
The kitchen is small, busy and visible for all to see what's going on!  the owners and staff are all friendly and welcoming.  Valentina makes you feel as though you a guest in her home.
Can't say enough good things about the people, place or food!!!  
bon apetit!"}
{"text":"Accommodating service! Helpful and gave great explanations and recommendations. Loved the heirloom tomato salad and very good homemade pasta. Quaint dining experience and we'll be back next time in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Wonderful crafted food. Sit near to the kitchen and you can watch the attention to detail. Nice adult atmosphere that we found very relaxing. Great spot!!!"}
{"text":"In honor of the first anniversary of our adventure in Italy, we decided to check out the Nonna Urban Eatery. Sitting out in the Piazza was perfect. The waitresses were lovely. The pastas are handmade. Try the Campanella pasta! It looks like a flower. The sauce was divine. The grilled octopus might freak you out because it's an octopus tentacle on a plate, but it's grilled perfectly, tender, and exactly what we had in Italy.

The menu is constantly changing according to the chef's whim, but they have a few favorites that don't change. Its also not strictly Italian! The chef is also a renowned sushi chef and the menu was fairly eclectic."}
{"text":"Pasta made fresh every day.  Today they have three different pastas.  The pasta with salmon and asparagus is absolutely incredible!  Friendly  wait team and a picturesque environment.  Eat outside!"}
{"text":"The food was really good but portions were small and the prices fairly large.  The service was slow but actually may have been the kitchen.  The waitress was charming.
Enjoyed the grilled octopus, the tuna tostada, and the shrimp ceviche.   Unfortunately needed another snack when we got home!!!"}
{"text":"Food was great, but unfortunately our experience was negative due to the service. We were a group of 12 women in town for a girls trip. None of us had been to the area before so we stuck to restaurants that boasted 'good for groups' which Nonna does (currently). When we were sat inside we were not treated well to say the least. The restaurant is very small, so I'm not surprised that a larger group didn't blend in. We waited at least 20 minutes to get a drink order in, and another 15 to get them and we ordered bottles of wine. 60 minutes went by before we put in our food order. It was obvious that the server did not like us, and we did not feel welcome. The food was very good, but I would not recommend this restaurant based on the service."}
{"text":"Just had dinner again at this restaurant last night. It was delicious!! I recommend the risotto, the poke bowl and the scallops. The pasta and sushi are also delicious. I recommend this place if you are looking for a restaurant with unique flavors. Location is right in oldtown scottsdale and they have a great selection of wines."}
{"text":"What a terrible experience. My wife and I came here after reading several positive reviews. It is nestled in a cute part of Scottsdale and our wait at the bar was pleasant. Servers were kind and we felt good vibes.

Unfortunately things went south once we were seated. I truly do not think I've ever waited so long without a server in my entire life. It may have been 20 minutes without anyone coming to acknowledge us. There's just no excuse. Further, we were seated next to an open kitchen which was just gross. It was dirty, the chefs were licking spoons...just a huge turn-off and seemed rather unsanitary.

After the ridiculously long wait, I put a $20 on the table (for a $12 dollar glass of wine) and we left without ever being acknowledged. We went a block over to Tommy V's Urban Eatery and had a lovely meal with excellent service. Nonna is small, I wanted to root for this place... we gave them longer than anyone else probably would have. Unfortunately I just have to give it a poor rating, would not recommend."}
{"text":"Tagliatelle 

Campanella with salmon and asparagus 

Place is nice and patio is 

And we had a $10 off coupon on our bill.  
We will definitely be back for more yummy fresh pasta."}
{"text":"It's a great little place, not the easiest to find, but worth it when you do. We had lunch here today, sat outside on their cute patio. The staff was very welcoming and friendly. I don't remember the names of the dishes, Italian words are too complex for me to pronounce properly without sounding like a total noob. The pasta dish I had came with Salmon, Asparagus and a creamy sauce. The pasta was so fresh, perfectly cooked. The salmon was moist and flavorful, and the sauce was creamy and full of flavor. My co-worker got the Bolognese and she loved it. We both planned to save some to take back for leftovers, but that failed as we both cleaned our plates clean because it was too good to box up. After such a carb filled meal, we were too full to get dessert, but they sounded great. We will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this restaurant based on the reviews. However like the previous review, the service was incredibly slow. The waitress would just disappear. Better yet, I ordered the seafood pasta. When the waitress put down my pasta she laughed and said oh I guess you just get shrimp tonight. Normally there are clams and mussels in the pasta. You would think for a small serving of seafood pasta that costs $20 I would be notified the only seafood going in that pasta is shrimp. Honestly I would pass on this place. There are much better Italian restaurants with better service."}
{"text":"Excellent Italian restaurant. Small, authentic and everything is really, really good. But, if it's your first time don't be tempted to order anything on the menu other than Tagliatelle with Ragu Bolognese! It's not that you would be dissatisfied with anything else from the menu, it's just that the house-made Bolognese is over the moon great. Order that, a glass of red wine (Sangiovese is my choice) and you will leave happy happy."}
{"text":"This place is extraordinary.  The Chef is a culinary master of multiple genres, with every dish reflecting worldly expertise.  The staff is familial, warm and engaging.  With pleasant atmosphere, great location, and incredible food above all - this place is one of our top favorites in Old Town!"}
{"text":"I am really confused by the other reviews of this restaurant. I checked them out before going to dinner here, and was really excited for a good meal. I can't say it met my expectations. I met up with some friends on a quiet Tuesday night. We were all from other time-zones, so we went to dinner \"early\" for this area, arriving at 6:00 pm. To my surprise, there were no other patrons. I figured they would trickle in as people got off work. SPOILER: they didn't...no one else showed up the entire time we were here (until 7:30 pm).

I ordered the Mexican mole tacos (yes...the Yelp listing says tapas, Italian, and French?) with rice. The tacos were dry and the rice was bland. Judging by my group's reaction to their dinners, they weren't that impressed either. It's too bad, because I had high hopes for this place."}
{"text":"I am so glad that I finally got to try Nonna!  My boyfriend and I had dinnner there last night, and we both loved it.  The service was great.  We first asked if they had rose' by the bottle, and our server brought us a tasting of the three that they offer.  We were told that the portions were on the smaller side, so we each ordered a pasta and then the Chicken Milanese to share.  Servings were not small.  I could have eaten only the pasta and would have been full...but I really enjoyed the chicken, so I'm glad we ordered both.  My bf had the seafood tagliatelle, which was delicious, but my pasta was definitely the highlight of the meal!  I had the Pappardelle with Mozzarella, Tomato, and Pesto.  It was so simple and sooooo AMAZING!  I think it's one of the best pasta dishes I've ever had, and I am a pasta fanatic.  I know their menu changes regularly, but I really want that dish to stay on there, because I desperately need to have it again!  The only reason for four stars instead of five is that it was too hot in the restaurant.  They were aware of it and had box fans, but it wasn't quite enough. Sweating while eating is not the best, but at least the food was so good that it was worth it!"}
{"text":"This has the most romantic and cute vibe with a great ambiance. The waitress was great and the servers were so quick to fill my water glass. The drinks were heavy and the food was legit delicious."}
{"text":"This is the sweetest little spot, wonderful service, the menu is on the smaller side but something for everyone. The Eggplant was To. Die. For."}
{"text":"Nonna's could easily have slipped to three stars in my estimation but for the especially good server, who managed our numerous questions and requests with humor and evident good will.  Nice job!  The ambiance is okay, reminding me of a typical restaurant in Italy, which is what I think Nonna's is trying to be.  In addition, the prices are reasonable, especially for the entrees.  The small plates are a bit high for the quantity given, but since each dish is made to order, the labor involved is substantial.  Their half-price wine deal, in effect the day we went, is a great value.

The problem is the food, which is not bad, but rather \"ordinary\".  The posole had heat but no other spicing.  In fact, you had better keep the salt handy when you dine here.  The bronzino special was done perfectly but needed salt and lemon.  The two pastas we tried - bolognese and pesto - were a bit disappointing.  The fresh home-made pasta was probably overcooked unless there was something strange in the recipe, but in any case it was mushy.  The sauces were plentiful but uninspired.  For example, a really good bolognese like you would get in almost any decent eatery in Italy, is made with wine, often burgundy, which gives it it's distinctive flavor.  Nonna's was just a meat sauce.

Even on a weekday in summer, Nonna's was nearly full, so I suggest reservations.  Problem is, you can only get them for large parties.  I have a problem with this policy because on a crowded night, you wait longer solely because you are eating with 2 or 4 people.

I think you should give Nonna's a try, order a few different things, and see if you can discover dishes that move you.  For the most part, we didn't but I would try again."}
{"text":"Fabulous food, service, and atmosphere. I wish I lived closer so I could regularly set up here with a good book, amazing pasta, and an awesome excellent glass of wine!"}
{"text":"Love Nonas. It has became our favorite family's restaurant 

I recently visited #NonnaUrbanEatery and it was an amazing experience. They have the best pasta in town, their service was very friendly and efficient. I, totally, recommend them and I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"A unique dining experience. Every entree provides a new opportunity to eat cuisine from around the world. The service is top notch, nothing like it in Old Town Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I thought I would try this place out with my friend, since it had great reviews. I guess I expected too much. When we sat down the server took a while to engage with us. I thought it was strange, since we were there when the doors opened and there was only one other table there. She finally came over and asked what we would like to drink. I wasn't sure of the wine, so she offered to bring a sample, which was nice. My friend ordered her wine and so we waited...and waited...and waited some more...and I finally looked over to see what was taking so long. Apparently, the server thought it was more important to stuff the menus than to bring our drinks??? I guess I got her attention when I looked at her with my unhappy face. So, she sent the owner's wife over to give me the sample and bring my friend her wine. I didn't like the sample, so I got another kind which was good. She brought over 3 small pieces of bread with oil. The bread was cold and hard. The oil had no taste. I didn't finish the whole piece. Our lunch was good, but you can't really screw up a pesto sandwich. It wasn't worth $12 when it didn't come with any side dish (no chips or fries). My friend ordered a chicken salad and it was rather large, so she was able to take the leftovers home with her. When getting the check, the server combined the tab (which really annoys me). So, my friend and I split the check 50/50. Still tipped them well, but was disappointed it wasn't a better experience. BTW, the bathroom is dual and I think it's gross to share when there's a urinal in there. I would not go back anytime soon. Sadly, I forgot to use the $10 off if you check in. Total bill for 4 glasses of wine, chicken salad and pesto sandwich was $72 not including the tip. I would rather spend my $43 for lunch elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Put this place first on your list of new restaurants in Scottsdale that you haven't yet tried.  The food is as fresh and delicately prepared as one could possibly find anywhere.  The space is gorgeous and elegant, yet comfortable and inviting.  The hosts, Valentina and Gian Franco make you feel as though you've all been great friends for years.  Nonna is Scottsdale's newest, little known gem.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Went to Nonna's for our anniversary this past weekend. Our timing was pretty good cuz we got there before it was packed full. We got right in and ordered drinks and a charcuterie board. It's a small location that's slightly set back away from Main Street, but totally worth it!  Small menu, but the selections are fabulous, my husband had the beef short ribs with mashed potatoes and fresh green beans. The meat melted in our mouths and the sauce was delicious. I ordered the salmon, Campanella pasta with asparagus and a lemon sauce. It was all amazing! The chef, Gian Franco, takes time to go around and check on each table which gives you the feeling of being truly taken care of."}
{"text":"The husband and I spent our anniversary at Nonna this year. The restaurant is super cute and we sat near the kitchen (so we could watch them cook). We started with their arancini... Which were stuffed with cheese and bacon... They were heavenly and the little salad it came with had the most delish sauce.... It was crazy good. For entrees, I had pasta vongole (clams) which I watched them make with wine, garlic, clams in the shell.... No weird premade clam sauce here. It was very tasty, fresh with parsley, and garlicky. The husband had essentially a deep fried piece of flattened chicken on mashed potatoes with some tomato salad on top. I didn't like the dish.... It was a bit bland.... But he really liked it, and that's really all that matters. I was a little sad to see that they microwaved their mashed potatoes to serve (instead of reheating in a pan with butter), but that wasn't a huge deal and I probably wouldn't have known if I couldn't see the kitchen. We had chocolate cake for dessert... It was decadent. I would come here again for a special occasion."}
{"text":"I'm conflicted if I should give a 1-Star instead but this place is very cute so the ambiance is good. However, the service is terribly slow with our first server having an attitude too. The food is less than ok actually. I have had much better Italian food than this. We ordered the cheese board and all the cheeses tasted so bland! The Brie doesn't taste like Brie at all, I don't think they were serving good cheese.. the crackers that they used to pair with were too sweet and the jam was overly sweet as well. When pair everything with the already bland cheese, it's like eating cookies with jam. Very disappointing. I ordered the Four Mushroom Risotto and the risotto is definitely wayyy undercooked and the taste of white truffle oil (as stated on the menu) is no where to be found. 

We ordered both of their desserts, the chocolate mousse cake and the butter cake and the chocolate mousse cake is surprisingly good, which make you wonder if they are sourced from else where!  I would give one star for the ambiance and one star for the desserts. This place is cute to bring your date to for the wine bar and dessert but other than that, I would say you probably will find much better tasting food in almost every other place in Old Town!"}
{"text":"Absolutely excellent food and great service.  I had the tuna poke bowl and it was amazing.  Sitting outside when the weather is nice is a bonus."}
{"text":"I can't stand when restaurants stop serving a full 30 minutes before their stated closing, and this one takes the cake. On a Friday in Scottsdale this stupid place was closed at 9:05pm. WTF???? Restaurants in Orlando and Hartford, Connecticut are open later. Absolutely ridiculous for a place of this supposed caliber. Be better than the Gap. Be better than the gap. You have to work if you own a restaurant and these guys seem more intent on closing than showcasing their food. Never again."}
{"text":"The service was unbelievably horrible. We saw our waitress twice and spent the majority of the evening looking for her or wondering where she was. The food was okay, but the seafood pasta was over salted and the mussels tasted fishy."}
{"text":"Just saw this changed hands again so decided to check it out and it was $5 bubbles friday so we were pretty excited about trying this place. Im not even kidding you....there were 2 other people here and 2 of us...we sat down and the server/ bartender literally took about 5-7 minutes to bring us water. We should've left right then but we liked what we saw on the menu so we ordered a cheese plate. Another 15 minutes pass and we now have empty glasses so we paid and left and went somewhere else for lunch. We were there for about an hour and never asked for another glass of champagne, never even asked if we wanted anything more than the cheese plate. Ridiculously slow. I mean, even the check took her 10 minutes."}
{"text":"Went to Nonna Urban Eatery for brunch and were pleasantly surprised by the contemporary ambiance, neat little tables and wonderful open kitchen. The menu is small but had some great choices. We started with prosciutto and melon and we were able to watch the chef/owner thinly slice the prosciutto that was positioned in a vice. We were surprised at the generous portion of prosciutto we received. Next we ordered the caprese salad which was very good and came with a pesto sauce and eggplant slices along with the classic sliced tomatoes, it had a very creamy burrata and was excellent. We then shared the Tagliatelle Bolognese which was very tasty. Even the complimentary bread, which we thought we recognized the taste of, and was confirmed by our waitress who told us she had purchased it at the Farmers Market on Saturday from Fabio on Fire; a great combination Nonna's and Fabio. And a perfect pairing to soak up great sauces. The prices are reasonable and the service is good, we will return."}
{"text":"Everything was absolutely incredible. Best salmon pasta I've ever had, with the unique citrus cream sauce. The mashed potatoes (that accompanied the chicken milanese) were out of this world, and the butter cake tied it all together perfectly. Great romantic ambience with the string lights and outdoor atmosphere! Definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"Most incompetent service. Food was good. Atmosphere is very nice. I would never go here again though based off the slow, bad service. It took 47 minutes for us to get our food. The table that sat down next to us after we ordered got their food first. Then the server lied and said they ordered first. Really?  An empty table ordered before we did?  We had salad and pasta!  Nothing that time consuming!  Not once between our placing an order and the moment I asked where are food was did anyone stop by and refill our drinks or check on us. After, We asked our server to split a check and they brought back two that totaled more than the original check with out any explanation. I would not recommend this place unless you are ok being forgotten and starving by the time you get food."}
{"text":"We just found this place. Seriously, what a gem. People are awesome and this place is awesome. 

This is the best secluded romantic restaurant you could ever have!

Super good food, vegetarian dishes really good, pasta  and it's right across from the Rusty spur!"}
{"text":"Was visiting old town when we happened upon this place for dinner. Wait staff was very friendly. Food was great. We got the eggplant burrata on our waitresses recommendation. The eggplant was great! Also got the Bolognese and the yellow tail with truffle. Both of which were really tasty."}
