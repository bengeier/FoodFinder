{"text":"We have been going to Great Eastern since it was opened under the current management.
It is one of the cleanest and most friendliest restaurants, 
We have tried many Hakka places in GTA, this one is the best in food quality and the taste is amazing. 
The owners are very polite and friendly people with excellent customer service.

Certified halal meat is used in all their dishes, The Halal certificate is clearly displayed at the counter for everyone to see. 
They do serve alcohol and it is not a secret !! The main sign board above the store front is clearly marked with \"LLBO\",  
If serving of alcohol in an establishment is any concern to you, Then I suggest you should read the signs before walking in to a restaurant."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner before the rush. It was clean and the staff was good about fielding questions. Very reasonable prices. Will return."}
{"text":"The food is disgusting. The scent of their restaurant has an impact on the taste of their food. I asked for my money back and was told \"because they made the food they don't issue refunds\". Horrible customer service from \"the manager\"  wouldn't even rate them with a start of possible. NEVER GO HERE. TERRIBLE TERRIBLE SERVICE"}
{"text":"Excellent food! Owners are very sweet and always respectful - not like other hakka restaurants where they have no manners. Crispy beef and the dry chili chicken are my favorite. Shrimp pakora is also really good - definitely a recommended place to eat."}
{"text":"Exceptional Chinese Hakka food. I highly recommend this place. Been there twice already and I can't wait to go back again. Food is just yum yum!!"}
{"text":"I make the trek from downtown Toronto frequently to eat at my favourite Hakka restaurant in the city.  The food here is amazing....I usually order the Chilli Chicken or the Manchurian Pakora, with each dish enough to feed 2 people. 

This places seems to be really busy for lunch, but I come for dinner.  Dishes are around $7-8.

I agree with Roma's comment on the staff; the people working there are always friendly and hospitable."}
{"text":"Food is great. Service is also good. The great thing it's that the staff speak English which is rare for a small Chinese restaurant. 

They have a sign saying that its Halal, but I seriously doubt it seeing that they serve alcohol there."}
{"text":"Based on my latest visit.

Visited them yesterday. We were a party of three. We ordered a Tom Yum soup, Pad Thai, Schezwan chicken and Sambal chicken.

Tom Yum soup was just salt water and some Chinese vegetables thrown in (mushrooms, yam, water chestnut, lettuce, bok choy). There was no lemon grass, galangal, no lime leaves. It was not Thai by any means.

Pad Thai was pretty bland too. No thai flavors too. When the host asked, how was everything we said it lacked flavour; was pretty bland. They were like we always do it this way.

Sambal chicken was good as always.

Schezwan chicken; let's just say I'm never gonna order it again."}
{"text":"Second time ordering from this place. First time: very good Hakka style Chinese food and good customer service. Second time, however, I would never recommend this place to anyone I care about. We ordered chicken fried rice which was kind of edible. The Cantonese chow mein was soggy and flavorless( please refer to photos) . The sweet and sour chicken was all sour and not sweet with a tomato like sauce saturated over the soggy peices of chicken ( again please refer to photos). I called the restaurant to tcomplain,to which I was told, nothing would be done as the recipe had not changed and because I ordered the food and took it home it became soggy (nonsense). Extremely dissatisfied and will never return. Save your money and go some where with respect for customers and cooking Hakka style cuisine!"}
{"text":"Amazing Food!!! This has to be my favourite Hakka places!  Scarborough knows how to do hakka.  My favourite items are the chilli chicken (dry version), fish pakora, crispy beef, Manchurian noodles and Singapore rice noodles. The staff are always very friendly and give great portions !  Used to go to Federicks / Lin Garden but now this is my go to place! They also have really good lunch specials!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner and had chilli chicken, Hakka beef noodle and chicken pakoras. The pakoras were nice and crispy, not too spicy and quite delicious. The Chicken and noodles were both very good as well, not too greasy and cooked well. The price was very reasonable and the portions are generous. The dining room is nice and clean. The staff were quite polite and warm to everyone. A nice little spot with good Hakka food."}
{"text":"On Saturday 19th December around 9.30 pm, my family went to have dinner at 
Esquire Great Eastern Hakka Chinese Restaurant at Vic Park and Sheppard. They had a big HALAL sign on their door. 

As we entered the restaurant the lady who 'claimed' to be the owner of this restaurant showed a very mean attitude and a stare at our little son who has a diagnosis of autism. Not only he was served water in a plastic mug; but later his plate was replaced with a plastic one too. I could not understand what is going on. I convinced myself thinking that it may be safer for my child to use plastic utensils. In fact, he had been to so many restaurants and we never had this experience. 

We saw alcohol being served inside the restaurant. My husband wondered about the authenticity of Halal food. He asked for the Halal certificate. They were unable to provide a proper response. We decided to leave. The lady confronted my husband. Instead of responding to him, she said the meanest thing I ever heard in Canada directed towards to my innocent son. She said that my son is a \"punishment\" from my God.

Oh poor lady, do you believe in God first? Do you think that God is there to punish people? What a stupid idea to think like that? Do you know the grave mistake you did by behaving in such a way? You touched something divine without knowing the depth of it. I did not tell you anything at that time while I was leaving the restaurant. Because I did not want my children to be exposed to the meanest people like you. 

Are you a mother or a grandmother or a single lonely person who goes behind only money without even knowing the simple human ethics? I feel very ashamed to look at you as a woman or as a human being. You will definitely reap what you harvest before you leave this world. At that time, think about what you said for my innocent little boy and what you said about him on a fine day. 

You haven't even learned basic human ethics or to earn a sincere living (by not deceiving people with an expired Halal certificate) living in this beautiful country. How can I expect you to know God or His infinite wisdom behind creations?"}
{"text":"Looking for Chinese food in the area and with good reviews we tried this little place out. It did not disappoint. The food was so tasty and the portions are big. The waitress even stopped us from ordering more so that we would finish all of it. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The servers (some of whom are also owners) are upbeat and take a lot of pride in their restaurant.   They are friendly and encourage one to come back.

I found the portions to be large, especially considering that I ordered during lunch time on the lunch menu.

Most of their dishes come mild/medium as standard, but if you ask the server to up the level of spice they can get you where you want to go.

I like their Spicy Thai noodles, and also their Szechuan Chicken.   Don't be afraid to order off-menu, the chef is happy to make changes and substitutions."}
{"text":"Small but spacious.
Love the cheap combos.

Great service, always with a smile. Good size portions. Been going there when we are in the area. No complains.

Recommend!"}
{"text":"Gimme that Mo-Meat
Gimme that Si-Simbol
Ladies love my style, at my table gettin wild
Get them bottles poppin, we get that drip Fish in Sweet and Sour sauce
Now give me 2 more dishes like Beef in Black Bean sauce

Szechuan Chicken Hell Yeaa
Eat it up, Eat-Eat it up,
When sober girls around me, they be actin like they drunk
They be actin like they drunk, actin-actin like they drunk
When sober girls around me actin-actin like they drunk

Poppin Curry with the rice, like a blizzard
When we eat we do it right gettin slizzard
Sippin sizzurp in my ride, like Three 6
Now I'm feelin so fly like a G6
Like a G6, Like a G6
Now I'm feelin so fly like a G6

Cheap Lunch for $7.  Very flavourful.  Eggplant had a good kick.  Portions were a bit small."}
{"text":"I only come here for their lunch specials during my lunch break as it is close to my office. Decent price, decent portion, great selection. It's not going to be the best food you've ever had, but the reasonable prices and quick turn around makes this an attractive option for a quick lunch. You are basically getting Chinese fast food here. 

I'm not an expert on Hakka food but most of the items seem pretty Cantonese to me. Anyways it's the kind of place I wouldn't mind going for if I happened to be in the area but it's certainly not a place to deliberately visit."}
{"text":"Hakka is kind of a childhood staple for me. I lived in Scarborough very briefly as a middle-schooler, and it was probably the only kind of food that I really enjoyed in our local area. This place is simple and and low-key. Nothing fancy at all.
Service is good, food is reasonable, everything is pretty clean and quiet.
Chili chicken and pakoras are personal childhood favorites, and they do all of them quite well!"}
{"text":"I recently started a new job near Victoria Park and Sheppard and have been looking for a solid lunch place to go to once in a while when I feel like treating myself, and I'm glad I discovered Esquire Great Eastern!

For $6.78, I got a take out dish of manchurian chicken sitting on steamed white rice with a corn soup.

The manchurian chicken itself was quite delicious and had quite the kick to it, and the corn soup tasted as expected. I wish there was a little more rice to go with the chicken, but it was a great meal and I am quite satisfied.

In addition, they have very friendly staff who greet you with a smile. And the cute waitress even came to give me my take out order while I was standing outside, that was very nice of her."}
{"text":"Excellent spot for a cheap delicious lunch! $6 for a main dish and soup or spring roll.
Try the: curry, chili or manchurian chicken.
Nice clean restaurant and helpful friendly service."}
{"text":"Still searching  for a quality good hakka place near me. The fish pakora is not spicy enough, the fish is incredibly fresh and I like that. They don't seem to put nearly as much flavors in their fish which is a bit confusing. The vegetable manchuran balls are okay, not great, but i guess i was expecting something else. 

maybe i'll come back and try other things on their menu. 

on a side note, the fish and chip place next door looks interesting... maybe i'll try there some other time."}
{"text":"Second time here because the prawn pakora is so good.  Nothing too spicy for my tolerance level so I can still enjoy the delicious flavour.  Great combo prices on a dish with rice, spring roll and a soda.  Very friendly service and I look forward to trying more from their menu!"}
{"text":"Last time i went with my friend for dinner after that both of us really got sick for 4 days. Rally?? What a bad reputation for u guys. Never coming back."}
{"text":"I used to frequent this location when it was Rasa Sayang, also a Hakka Chinese restaurant, but not to be confused, Great Eastern is definitely a cut above all Hakka style digs in Toronto. 

The place is pretty much a clean, casual, family style eatery with excellent, hospitable service. The lady manning the restaurant always has a warm, smiling disposition, that you can't help but leave feeling positive about the experience. 

My favourite dish is the Manchurian Pakora dish($8.50), made with freshly deep fried vegetarian dumplings in spicy manchurian sauce. I also heartily recommend the Kung Pao chicken($8), which is not saucy, but colourful in its peanut, vegetable and stir fried chicken splendor. 

An easy standard is set when you fall in love with a family favourite, the Eggplant in hot garlic sauce($7.50), which is unsurprisingly extremely garlic-y. 

I pretty much expect to try almost all the dishes at least once."}
{"text":"One day I was craving for Chinese food but with a difference and after googling up to see what other Chinese places were around with convenient take-out food, I picked Esquire Great Eastern as a choice place to get my take-out for the evening.
I had the Beef Ho-fun, Sweet Hakka Noodles, Manchurian Vegetable Fried Rice, and the Tofu in Hot Garlic Sauce. The flavors from each dish went well together. I have not had Ho-fu in a long time and it was delicious. I only know by the other name Kway Teow and it was so good to have this in a long time. The hakka noodles was also good and the fried rice and the flavor of the tofu in garlic sauce also blended well. 
I'll be getting more food from here the next time I want a Chinese dinner evening."}
{"text":"Google gave good reviews of this place but I don't see the appeal. The food is okay. I have had better hakka style food near airport road. We had the Tom Yum chicken soup which was more sour than it needed to be. The pad thai tasted like the noodles were dipped in the Tom yum soup for flavoring! And the beef schezwan was very syrupy. I guess I got what I paid for since it's cheap, but still, should've been much better."}
{"text":"The food here is very yummy and flavourful!  Even very simple dishes are super yummy.  Two of my favourite dishes are the sambal chicken and the red Thai curry with beef.  The spices used seem to be more aromatic.  Pricing is also very descent.  I came here for lunch today with 4 other people and we ordered 4 dishes."}
{"text":"Best Hakka Chinese !

I have been to many Hakka places in Montreal and Toronto, did not like any!
Most of the places just add salt and serve, the dishes taste just soy.

The food here is not only cheap but surprisingly delicious. They offer special Menu for lunch and dinner both, along with regular menu which has much bigger portion.
Me being vegetarian like their : American Chop suey, Manchurian Balls.
My husband loves their : ginger fish, sambal chicken ,chilly chicken, chicken manchurian.

Their meals are served with rice and either of your choice : (tea/pop/spring rolls) .

The owner lady is really nice and accommodates your special food requirements if any."}
{"text":"One of my new favourite places to eat. Great food. Great prices. Great service. Still learning the menu but loving what I've had so far."}
{"text":"Love their crispy beef! Have been visiting this place for years, before the change of name in the restaurant. The Greek place beside this restaurant \"Athens\" is a perfect way to end a delicious meal! Love this spot for the food and Hakka style Chinese food cravings!"}
{"text":"In one word: Excellent.  I discovered that place accidentally on my way to Johnny's burgers, Since that day  I tried about 10 different dishes from their menu and I would rate all of them between 8-10, seriously, the food is fresh, tasty and the service is great.  

Their lunch deal is amazing: $6 for main course on rice, and a choice of a drink, spring roll or soup. Can't go wrong with that deal.. 

My favorite dish over there is the Manchurian chicken/beef.  Other then Yueh Tung which is located all the way downtown, they have the best Manchurian chicken in town!"}
{"text":"I come here at least once a month with my partner. Limited seating but always friendly and attentive service. Food is yummy and prices are even better for the portions you recieve. 

I love the pakoras! Also feels good to support a small  family(?) run business."}
{"text":"The service was horrible and it took 20mins for someone to come and tell us that we cannot share our food that hadn't even arrived, so we left. The manager told us never to come back again. This is the second time we were there and the service was disgusting!"}
{"text":"3.5/5

What makes this restaurant stand out is the affordable prices for their Lunch Combos. You could probably get around a similar portion size at another restaurant for $8-$10, but here, it's $6-$7.50. The place is aesthetically clean and appealing, and the environment is very cozy.

The staff are super friendly, and when I told them to tone it down on the spicy for a dish that had 3 hot pepper symbols), they toned it done. I really appreciate how they actually listen to custom modifications when ordering.

I ordered the Manchurian Chicken and the Vegetable Delight. Both were pretty good but I wouldn't say outstanding.

Overall, by experience here was very good! If you are interested in some South Asian Fusion cuisine, this place is worth a try!"}
{"text":"Excellent, warm customer service. Food was great value for the price. Beautiful waitress."}
{"text":"The location and restaurant setup is good. Food quantity was very little the chilli chicken was very oily. Price was good service was good"}
{"text":"I have been to many hakka places in Scarborough and this is one of my favourite hakka places. We usually get the Hakka Chicken or The House special chicken, simply yummy, chicken is nice and moist and very tasty. We get the chili chicken and tandoori chicken both have perfect flavours and very delicious. The Chicken manchurian soup is one the best I have ever had. The owner is very friendly and nice, small family run business. They are always open to feedback and accept it very positively. It is a simple hakka place not too fancy in looks, but the food is amazing.It is quite busy on weekdays during lunch time."}
