{"text":"Came in after an intense workout, I was the only one there. Service was quick and prices are super affordable! I ordered a glass of Pinot Grigio which was nice!  Then I ordered the butter chicken, and it was VERY salty. I ate all of the chicken but it was too salty to finish. Being that it was really dead I was checked on often, by 3 different staff members. Slightly disruptive but I really didn't mind. I definitely let them know about the food was too salty, so I'll definitely come back to see if they've improved!"}
{"text":"Can only review the cocktail. Came on a Friday night. It was pretty dead. Just a small party smoking hookah....and me.   Was alone for a while, and the bartender was super nice. She let me charge my phone and chatted with me while I waited for my date.   Was surprised to learn that cocktails were buy one, get one free. Asked the girl what she recommended and she said the Singapore sling. It was tasty - didn't taste like alcohol. Then my guy showed up, and I was going to order the 2nd cocktail for him. However, the deal is only for ladies. So weird. And that wasn't really explained. Nor was there an obvious posting of this deal in the bar or on the menu.   The menu is huge. Too big. Wonder why it was so dead on a Friday night during the busiest time ever."}
{"text":"Why am I constantly watching good-charismatic-family owned places closing down just for another junk food chain to appear? I feel that lacking healthy options is worst than an insult for the community.  St. Clair Av. has been in constant trashy transformation. Here are your options to plug your veins, give you a further hearth attack, keep their workers on minimum wage, make you addicted, guilty, and make you think as if you had no choice. I don't consider necessary to write the names of those junk food chains that belong to people who wouldn't consume their own monster creations (enough money for manipulation have they been spending).   Writing about Tantra Lounge gives me strength and empowers me as a woman. The two warriors who attended us reminded me of some determined women I've had the luck to share moments with. Even when their place was semi empty, they treated us like family.  The food was made at the moment without microwave.  We were told that they support artists, reason why their walls were full of culture. Being surrounded by itinerant paintings should be a must to visit this place. The ambiance was marvelous as well.  My advice: start supporting smart businesses because maybe one day you'd be on their quest."}
{"text":"The  waiter was nice but the food terrible. We order 2 burgers for the kids and it was not eatable. Too spicy. Would not recommend if you have kids."}
