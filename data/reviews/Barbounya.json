{"text":"Delicious food, super nice staff. It's \"big tapas style\". We were 3 and shared 5 plates. Price are ok for a tapas restaurant. Cocktails are good too. The place is beautiful! Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Had a great meal tonight! Went to Barbounya with one of my girlfriends and we both loved it. I'm a vegetarian and was very happy to see there were tons of options for me. The eggplant was great, and I thought the deep fried kale was excellent. My friend had the lamb and said it was amazing. The portions were well sized and the wait staff was very friendly and attentive. Will be returning again soon!"}
{"text":"Turkish Cuisine is best known for its simple comfort food - the falafel, hummus dip, or kebab, but it's also a very rich and tasteful cuisine you can discover at BarBounya.   We had the Muhamarra (hot pepper dip), the Gozleme (savoury pastry), the trout, the lobster sandwich and a pull pork dish, all pretty yummy.   To check it all out, see my full review of the restaurant here:  https://delifeed.wordpress.com/2015/06/29/barbounya-fine-turkish-dining-on-laurier/"}
{"text":"What makes me come back over and over again, other than \"Istanbul Mon Amour\" (my favourite drink) and their mouthwatering desserts, is their ever changing menu that encourages you to try new things every single time...

{"text":"Food 3/5 staff&service 4/5 decor 4/5  We got their MTL à Table special since their regular menu wasn't available. The presentation of the food was nice, beautiful vividly coloured ingredients  siting on a wood plank, but the food tasted very bland. We started with an octopud salad, some tempura kale (super yummy!) and a chickpea and beet salad (it was served warm so the beets tasted slimy). The mains consisted of a barley salad which was just soaked in oil and was lacking spice (like rice with arugula and then oil, that's it), a plate of pulled pork (dry) on chick pea purée and 2 pieces of lamb kefta (lacked spice, tasted like hamburger meat).  See pictures of our starters inclued to get an idea of portion sizes. Mains are about the same size. 2× MTL a table 31$ 2× glass of white wine Total bill included tax and tip 136$"}
{"text":"Inspired food Had an amazing brunch  Highly recommend!  Go for the savory--the French toast was good, but not representative of what the kitchen can do with fresh ingredients.  Bravo!"}
{"text":"Je suis tombée en amour avec le décor. À la fois chic, industriel et confortable.   Le service est super sympathique et souriant. Très chaleureux aussi.  Le menu est en papier et ainsi, le client peut inscrire lui-même ce qu'il veut commander. Tout a l'air délicieux. Le magret de canard et compote de figues confites est particulièrement bon. Tout comme le gâteau aux pistaches imbibé d'un sirop vanillé et accompagné d'une purée d'abricots.   Seul petit hic, il faut 3 à 4 plats par personne pour manger à sa faim et les prix de chacun varient entre 8 et 16 $ ... La facture grimpe vite. Surtout que les bouteilles débutent à 40$ et vont très vite en montant.   Malgré tout, c'est un bel endroit pour un repas en amoureux ou un apéro entre amis pour papoter un peu sur de grandes tables à partager."}
{"text":"Great tasting of Mediterranean food served as Tapas. Favors the sharing a variety of dishes. Mouthwatering plate presentation. The food brings you there the ambiance makes the experience enjoyable. 2013-08-21"}
{"text":"Mon restaurant préféré à Montréal ! Le menu du soir est absolument exquis et que dire des brunch, uniques et vraiment succulents ! Fraicheur, saveurs exquises et plats diversifiés à partager dans une ambiance des plus agréable. Un gros + pour la possibilité de réserver en ligne, même pour le brunch.  Dépaysement garanti !"}
{"text":"The Good: The food here is really good and unique. We had some really good fish dishes, including octopus, the barbounya and tuna. They all tasted really fresh and were very nicely presented. We ordered 9 dishes (see \"The Ugly\" below) and I thought that perhaps 6/9 were very delicious.  The Bad: The setup is very strange. We reserved a table for 3 and we were seated at a bar like table. My friend was seated at the corner so it made it awkward for her to talk to both of us. I much prefer sitting at a table where I can talk to my friends face to face.  The Ugly: The price!!! As you can tell from the pictures, these dishes are teeny tiny! This restaurant is tapas style, which means you need to order at least 2-3 dishes/person to feel even remotely satisfied. Yet the price here for one dish is comparable to other regular restaurants. We were three girls last night and we ordered 9 tapas to split among us. We each had perhaps 2-3 glasses of wine and we shared two desserts. At the end, the bill for each was $100 (including tip)!   I had a fun time, but I will not be back."}
{"text":"If you're looking for brunch with a twist, this may be the place for you.  For Saturday and Sunday brunch, they offer up a prix fixe menu that gives you a sampling of appetizers and a choice of entree for $14.50.  The apps include (from the website) honey and kaymak (like a clotted cream), olive mix, tomato and ricotta salad, nuts and dried fruits, homemade nut spread (like Nutella), homemade jams (we got orange and some sort of berry), and bread. The honey and kaymak is the star of the plate - I could have eaten the stuff by the spoonful, but I decided to be lady-like and ate it with bread... which was also very very very good.  Oh, the bread. I have no idea what kind of bread it was, but it was crusty on the outside, tender on the inside, and had this wholesome nutty flavour. Yum. Thankfully our server was super nice about giving us more bread whenever we ran out. (I can't stand places that are stingy with bread, ugh.)  On to the mains. Much deliberation was needed, as all of the mains sounded delicious to me. Ultimately, I decided on the shakshuka. The eggs were just perfectly set, the tomato sauce delicately spiced, and the whole dish finished with just the right amount of herbaceousness. Others in my party ordered the borek and lamb meatballs and they were all pretty happy with their choices too.  I love brunch and I love that Barbounya serves up something different from your standard brunch fare. Everything I had tasted great and service was fantastic. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I went there about three or four times and it seems like this cuisine is in serious decline. Service wise I find the staff members a little nonchalant (borderline arrogant sometimes). One of them completely forgot to bring one of our dishes (out of 5). After a long wait we cancelled it. Oysters are expensive considering their thumbnail like size. The savoy stuffed pastry dish called bourek is simply too dry, so is the poulet rôti.   There are some good items once a while but Barbounya's value is no longer there. At least there's still the kaymak (butter and honey served with hot bread), which is truly worth getting out of bed for."}
{"text":"Man... I really wanted to like this place, but the Maitre D' really flushed the entire mediocre experience down the toilet last night....  The set up of the restaurant is not optimal as it is all high tables and high chairs. We were two couples seated at the corner of the table and so it was a little difficult to carry on a conversation at such a weird angle. But, no stars removed for poor design....  This is a meze (ie. tapas) bar, and so the menu is quite limited. I didn't find it to be super varied to be honest, but we chose 8 distinct tapas to try out and were excited about them. As soon as our waiter (who later bluntly informed me that he was the maitre d') took our order, he fussed about us having placed two separate orders as two couples. He told us that it was in our best interest to order things as a group of 4 rather than in couples to \"enhance the experience\". We then informed him that we had some food intolerances etc, and that we preferred to order separately. He was very displeased but we didn't really care because.. well... why tell us how to place our orders??? This was definitely not our first tapas experience and so we know that our night won't be \"ruined\" if we have two separate bills..  Onto the food and service... Service was pretty slow (over 2 hours!) and they forgot to bring out one of our dishes. Food was mediocre at best. Not one single dish was amazing, and some dishes lacked any real flavor. Portion sizes were as expected.   Up till this point, I was mentally rating this restaurant as a 3.5/5 (because that's what I do.. haha). But what happened next was really phenomenal.  We were asked if we were done, and after mentioning that they forgot a dish, I asked for it to be removed from the bill because we weren't going to wait another 30 min for another mediocre plate. My husband also distinctly asked for 2 bills. Lo and behold, we get one bill totalling $250. At this point, I'm aggravated because not only was the service so-so the entire night, but now our requests were being flat out ignored.  So, I call him back, and explain quietly that we asked for two bills. I get told that this restaurant doesn't make out separate bills because this is a \"group experience\". I then tell him that every single restaurant in Montreal will split bills, and that we had placed our orders separately in the first place to make things easier. He then told us that they don't split bills because he \"doesn't have time to split a tapas plate into 1/5 of the price for everyone who requests it, BUT that because he's the matire d', he'll make a special exception, AND not to expect it next time because this is a GROUP EXPERIENCE\"'.............  Do I really need to explain my frustration??  So I told him that we were not asking for ANY tapas to be split any way, and that we just wanted separate orders on separate bills. At this point, we could have paid it as is but it was really a matter of principle.....  UGH. Seriosuly, hands down, worst service in Montreal. Not worth the trip OR our $150 bill. You can get much better tapas in tons of places in Montreal for that price.  BLEH."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant pour le brunch. C'est un restaurant style tapas qui se partage bien.   Le service était accueillant et attentionné. On a rajouté une personne à la réservation et, malgré l'achalandage, la serveuse nous a trouvé une place. Nous n'avons jamais manqué d'eau (pichet d'eau sur la table que l'on versait dans nos verres). Le serveur nous a amené un menu de thé et tisane, ce qui était intéressant pour une amie enceinte.   La nourriture pour le brunch était originale. Les choix étaient à 16$ (18$ pour deux options). Il y avait une entrée à partager qui venait automatiquement avec notre choix de plat principal. Ainsi, on nous amenait une planche de pain avec une confiture à la fraise (ou cerise, je l'ai pas goûtée), confiture à l'orange, tartinade de chocolat avec tahini, fromage en crème et miel, mélange de noix et fruits secs et mélange d'olives. Le tout avec une salade de tomates, concombres et fromage (ricotta?).  J'ai pris un effiloché de canard que j'ai partagé avec mon amie qui avait un boerek (filo farcie aux bettes à carde avec feta et fines herbes). Nos autres amis ont pris un cassolette d'uf avec steak haché et oignons et un plat de pain doré.   Décor : Les places sont un peu étroites et les tables sont faites sur le long ou en forme de bar  pour être partagées avec d'autres personnes, mais ça ne nous dérangeait nullement. Beau décor, luminaires suspendues modernes avec lumières jaunes. Chaises hautes, mais le cuir (ou simili cuir) est déchiré. Toilettes propres. Le restaurant à une belle ambiance style lounge. Pour une première rencontre, c'est intéressant, mais il n'y a pas d'intimité considérant que les tables sont partagées et les places étroites.  Prix : 16-18$ (avant taxes et pourboire) par personnes. Expresso 3$ et Mimosa 6$.   À découvrir ! J'y retournerai sans doute!"}
{"text":"Omg the ricotta cheese and the barista makes the best lates. Brunch was delicious and service was excellent. Coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Si vous aimez la cuisine turque....il faut vous précipiter à ce restaurant! Il est un peu éloigné du métro Laurier...mais ça vaut le coup....et ceci même s'il pleut des cordes (ce qui était mon cas!)  Petite astuce, il faut absolument réserver pour avoir la chance de déguster leur cuisine et il faudra également affronter une line up!  Ça fait beaucoup d'efforts, certes mais vous serez comblés! Moi je l'ai teste dans le cadre de Montreal à table et d'un brunch dominical!  Chaque brunch vient avec un plateau en bois rempli de douceurs (miel kaymak, salade tomate/ricotta,olives, confitures et tartinade maison, abricots secs et avec ça du pain chaud à volonté cuit sur place!!) c'est un vrai régal et une mise en bouche de qualité!!! Ensuite nous avions plusieurs propositions de plats et avons testé pas mal de spécialités, notamment les pides (pizza turques) et terrine d'agneau de Kamouraska.  Tous les plats étaient frais, goûteux et rassasiants...bref parfait! La salle est chaleureuse et accueillante! J'y retournerai les yeux fermés, sans hésiter!!!!"}
{"text":"After a disappointing lunch, I was hopeful with BarBounya. I was rewarded and my meals balanced. I ordered 3 items - lamb tataki, lamb kefke and a cheese fondue similar to saganaki. There was breadsticks and olive oil as well, with the cheese fondue eaten both as is and with the breadsticks. I thoroughly enjoyed all my dishes, with the tataki being spectacular. Service was great and I definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"This was my first stop for the #TasteMTL/#MTLATable extravaganza. Barbounya is a Turkish restaurant - they offered up a tasting menu containing 10 dishes, plus two desserts, at a fixed price of $29. They offer wine pairing for an additional cost, if this interests you.  Location: Laurier West - if you get to the restaurant early, you can check out the shops in the area to kill time. I lucked out and got a parking spot right outside the restaurant - Woohoo! That said, I'm not sure if this would have happened if I had arrived later in the evening (I got there around 5:15 and our reservation was at 6pm).   Service: The host was OK.  Our wait staff was lovely - they explained each dish to us so we knew exactly what we were getting. Overall, the service was a bit slow BUT, it was a full house due to event, so no real complaints here. This allowed us to enjoy our food and conversation at a leisurely pace and we never felt rushed to leave after we finished our meal - I think we stayed for an hour after we paid, and no one asked us to hit the road.   Food: I posted a photo of the full menu, so won't outline each dish here; I'm not sure if all restaurants will be doing this, but Barbounya served all items on their menu in small portions, so we got to taste everything. The Mezzes were delicious! The Barbounya and Lakerda were both absolutely amazing, and for someone who isn't really into mussels, I really enjoyed these - the broth was super savory and very light. I think the Barbounya and Lakerde were my favorite, but I loved the other Mezzes too so it's tough to pick one specific dish.   Sadly, the mains didn't impress me as much as the Mezzes. Now, that being said, I am generally not a meat eater so you will have to judge for yourselves. The pork belly was way too chewy for me though the crispy bits were quite good. My dinner date loved the pork belly so I don't think you can go wrong with that one because she's a pork belly afficionado. The quail left me unimpressed as it was dark meat, which I am not a fan of. That said, I found it to be too chewy for my taste and lacking in overall flavor.  Surprisingly (keep in mind that I hardly ever eat read meat, like ever!), I enjoyed the spicy lamb tartar. The flavor was pronounced but not overpowering at all. Of course, it's raw meat so I'm going to use the word 'chewy' once again, but it was quite good. My favorite was the barley salad - it was delicious and the flavor was outstanding.  For dessert, we had baklava and a walnut chocolate mouse w/maple syrup. O.M.G that was the best dessert EVER! If you love chocolate, you will adore this dessert. Words can't describe it's deliciousness, though the wait staff told me the chef made it with love, so I guess I was tasting all that love :) The baklava was equally good - moist and not too sweet. I've had baklava in Turkey and can say that this one is on par with it.  Vibe: Awesome. Loved the space, loved the music. It's super casual and very chillaxed. The only thing I don't understand is the big bull on the wall. Bulls aren't really a Turkish thing! :) Verdict: Defnite hit - I will go back to try out their a la carte menu. Check it!"}
{"text":"We went there for breakfast, the plates were extremely small they brought a tomato cucumber salad which consisted of cucumbers and a little cheese, it is an expensive restaurant no one pays 18 dollars for cucumber. We ordered a Turkish pizza it had only a little cheese on it. Overall nothing was tasty."}
{"text":"J'ai essayé le Barbounya avec un groupe de copines pour un brunch, et je dois dire que nous avons toutes adoré! Le choix de plats était intéressant, nous avions toutes pris des trucs différents pour goûter, et personne n'a été déçue! Les plats étaient vraiment délicieux, frais et savoureux! Par contre, je ne les ai pas trouvés spécialement turcs, mais après je ne m'y connais pas plus que ça en brunch turc ^^ Nous avions réservé, et on avait bien fait car il y avait un line up (à la fin, il y avait aussi un line up pour payer avec la machine! :D ) L'endroit est assez réputé, donc je vous conseille de réserver Les jus étaient frais aussi Le service était top et les prix corrects Le décor est cool aussi, assez chaleureux Il y avait de toutes tranches d'âges comme clients A tester!"}
{"text":"I made a reservation here for 4 on Friday afternoon and didn't have any difficulty getting a table at 8:30pm. The restaurant has a cool seating arrangement, with a maze of bar top level seats. Everyone is essentially sitting at a bar, but it doesn't feel like it because the rest of your party sits on the other side. They also have a private room in the back that seats about 20 people, near the bathrooms. The ambiance is warm and cozy, we sat right by the kitchen and were very comfortable. There was a coat rack near the front door.  For food we ended up eating family style and ordered a few pides, which are like Turkish pizzas but very long and narrow, and mezes. We had the Sudjuk pide which was my favorite, the kasserie cheese pide, which had nice notes of feta cheese, the homemade pita (which resembled an Indian puri), the lamb kofta (only 2 meatballs), the cornish hen (which was one thigh with a drumstick and one breast and wing- not the full hen) and the beetroot meze. Everything was delicious, but honestly a bit small for the proportions. I would have expected at least 3 meatballs, at least a full hen, and maybe more of everything else. We had a fairly light meal for around $20/ person and left wanting to try dessert elsewhere. I love the location, but might only come back to try the brunch. I wouldn't recommend it highly for dinner."}
{"text":"J'ai été attiré dans ce restaurant pour leur photo de pain doré qui n'est plus disponible au menu. Mais je ne regrette rien... C'est délicieux. La terrasse extérieure est très confortable... en une journée de printemps, cet endroit est idéal pour un brunch en amoureux ou entre amis. Le pain est divin et les sauces d'accompagnement sont d'une saveur nouvelle à mon palais... j'adore decouvrir de nouvelles saveurs et voir comment on déjeune dans d'autres cultures.. la cuisine turque est fraiche, délicieuse et à partager... le service est impeccable... je le recommande pour vous changer des brunchs habituels d'oeuf saucisse bacon..."}
{"text":"My first visit to Barbounya was Nov 2016 for MTL a Table. It was a Friday night so it was very loud (you have to reserve to get a table). For my full review, please visit: https://therealmtlfoodie.wordpress.com/2017/10/19/barbounya-is-a-turkish-flavour-explosion-waiting-to-happen/"}
{"text":"Brunch : Turkish inspired breakfast which comes with a board of jams, honey, spreads, salad with homemade ricotta, olives, and absolutely delicious bread. Service fantastic, very attentive. Then pide (Turkish flatbread) which was also great. Love this unique to Montreal brunch menu. Perfect if you want something different for a change than your average two eggs, potatoes thing. Their special was a crepe with butternut squash purée and a cinnamon syrup with pistachio which sounded amazing but wasn't feeling something sweet this morning. Will have to go back!"}
{"text":"On a essayé dans le cadre de Montréal à table qui a fait beaucoup baisser le prix. L'ambiance est plutôt bonne. C'est un peu étrange de devoir passer à travers les toilettes pour accéder à la salle arrière. Aussi, l'implantation des tables pour maximiser le nombre de tables fait qu'on ne peut pas se lever sans déranger d'autre tables. Le service était correct, la nourriture aussi. Mais les prix sont bien trop élevés en temps normal et la nourrit trop ordinaire pour que je considère ce restaurant une prochaine fois.  Finalement, nous étions un groupe d'amis pour manger, et à la fin on ne nous donne qu'une seule facture avec inscrit dessus que c'est pour mieux nous servir. FRANCHEMENT?!? J'ai été serveur et ça prend quelques secondes pour émettre plusieurs factures! Au lieu de ça, on a tous sorti nos téléphones pour savoir qui a pris quoi etc... Vraiment ridicule! Ça laisse un mauvais goût lorsqu'on sort de là.   Je ne recommande pas du tout."}
{"text":"I wife and I went for their weekend brunch. We were completely blown away by. Recently priced and delicious food. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Parmi mon top 5 à Montreal, la cuisine est d excellente qualité à chaque fois et le service toujours très pro et agréable. Tous les plats sont bons, je ne pourrai rien suggéré en particulier. Aussi, j'ai essayé le brunch est c'était merveilleux (plateau de confitures maison et pain à partager, et d'autres découvertes que je ne pourrai citer, et un plat au choix) à un prix défiant la concurence vue la qualité et la fraîcheur !! Aussi, c est super facile de réserver en ligne !"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying, no amount of good food can make up for lack luster service. While the food at Barbounya was cooked and seasoned well - it was not outstanding. Presentation was nice. We were a group of 7 women (30's) from the US -- however we are very polite, not loud, and know how to act in a restaurant. We were immediately seated in the extremely not busy restaurant that we had a reservation for. A few minutes after we sat an elderly couple came in after and sat down behind us. Not more than 5 minutes later did they get up and explain in French to the waiter that they were not staying because of us. They totally judged us. Our main waiter was very kind (male, dark hair), HOWEVER, the female waitress was so rude (yes, you with the dark hair and lip ring) she wouldn't stop talking about us and laughing about us in French with her coworkers. We know what you said. You should be embarrassed to speak about patrons in front of them like that. There's better Turkish food out there, there's better Mediterranean food out there... I personally wouldn't waste my time here. Such a shame!"}
{"text":"I went to Barbounya twice  Both times were pleasant  I enjoy the fact that the food is different. It's a Turkish restaurant but food is more of a Middle Eastern/Mediterranean influenced cuisine I had the lamb tartare which was amazing because of the middle eastern spices  We shared cheese cigars, fried crab, chickpea and beet salad  Everything was a hit amongst everybody except for the fried soft shell crab. Some people liked it and some others were too weirded out to eat a whole crab even with the legs and shell.  Service was great  The vibe was nice. The place wasnt too noisy  It's a bit on the pricy side, if you're really hungry it can add up fast.  Can't wait to try their brunch."}
{"text":"Fancy and Great ambiance, wide variety of food with a Turkish touch, making it taste even better. Tried their brunch too, very original - Traditional Turkish mezze sharing platter with a choice of main dish per person. Really nice interior design, cool music - definitely recommended for a friends dinner, romantic date or co-workers gathering."}
{"text":"Bel endroit. J'y suis allé pour le brunch c'était bon mais pas renversant. Ça change des brunch qu'on a l'habitude de trouver sur toutes les cartes."}
{"text":"I'm actually giving this place a 3.5* My boyfriend and I were actually strolling our way towards another restaurant for brunch on a beautiful winter morning (romantic, I know) and we walked passed this place by chance.   THEY NOW HAVE BRUNCH! :D  Food: the food is very simple, but tasty. I ordered the pulled chicken sandwich and it was pretty good, not the best but very satisfying (ask for their home made mayo). The coffee is of very good quality - for those who love their coffee.  **we walked in the first week they started the brunch menu and I heard that it was going to be tweaked**   Service : great service. Very attentive and knowledgable.  Decor : Urban. Totally fits in with that area. An eclectic blend with a lot of character.  I recommend this place and would bring friend here."}
{"text":"Oh Barbouyna, you could have been a 5.  Let's get down right to business:  Falafel, marinated vegetables, yogurt-tahini Some sort of upgraded version of your lowly traditional falafel. Very good, served on a bed of greens, the yogurt-tahini was exquisite.   Hummus, beets, sudjuk This plate was too simple to my liking; hummus and beets? The sudjuk slices were far too little and were overpowered by the hummus.   Small Gözleme, feta, ricotta, herb Delicious! Loved their take on this, pan-fried both sides gives it a nice crunch.  Cauliflower, colourful carrot, coriander yogurt Beautiful presentation, but lackluster items. Different coloured carrots on a plate? Deliciously grilled, but I don't go to the restaurant to eat 4 of that.  Grilled calamari, fennel-chilli oil Over-cooked in my opinion, arrived at our table too chewy to comfortably swallow.   Spicy salmon, celeriac, fennel, dill Very interesting spice mix for the salmon coating  Pig's neck, mograbiah, pomegranate One of my favourite dish of the night; the mograbiah cannot be missed. I would compare this to comfort food, braised pork with a pasta bed.  Poached lamb Köfte, sun chokes Sadly this came at the end - otherwise, I would have devoured it in a heartbeat. The lamb Köfte was amazing and the sun chockes, fried in a chip-like fashion, were deliciously crunchy. Highly dish.  Baklava A twist on the traditional baklava, served with generous amounts of cocoa powder; I have to say that I must prefer the sweeter, stickier, cocoa-less version of it. Meh.  Chocolate mousse, topped with halva  I forgot the name of this dish; however it was the highlight desert. Not sure so it was very traditionally turkish, as it tasted very much like a decadent chocolate mousse cake. The texture and sweetness to cacao ratio was amazing. Would have gladly ate 3 more slices.  Revani For the uninitiated (like I was), the texture comes close to a sweet couscous. While it wasn't unpleasant, it didn't hold itself together well and it didn't do much for me.  Bread Served on a pizza peel-like contraption, it came in finger-width portions, hot still from the oven. It was very tasty, soft when hot and crunchy when cold, and could be dipped in the adjacent virgin olive oil dish.  Istanbul mon amour Their in-house cocktail, made with rose water, cava and grenadine. Simply delicious, a sparkly delight.   The Good:  Presentation was amazing and I loved the feel and ambiance of the place. Much thought has been put into decorating and eating there really feels like an experience, not just a restaurant outing.  The Bad: When the bill comes, it hurts..! Although we did try a lot of the dishes on the menu, a lot of them felt like very poor value once we got the plate (I'm looking at you, carrot/cauliflower dish). The set-up is also strange, as other users have pointed out; we were a group of 6 yet we shared the table with another group of 2, and another group of 3.   The service was very nice and attentive, waiters very knowledgeable about the menu ingredients and items. However at the time of paying, they refused to split the bill the way we wanted and it made things awkward to pay.  Barbouyna overally was an excellent experience; I will definitely come back for more for brunch!"}
{"text":"The food is great. They really thought out all the dishes and flavours to fit together. No single taste was overpowering an other taste. I also discovered some new and interesting flavour combinations.   The ambience is nice and the staff are really helpful describing and suggesting things on the menu.   A small meal can easily cost you upwards of 60$.   If you plan to stop by without a reservation you might be stuck eating at the bar and not at a table.   Would suggest if you are not too hungry and looking for new tastes."}
{"text":"A must try! It's my first time going there for brunch, but not my last. If you're looking for something different, this is the place. I was introduced to a variety of amazing flavors. Honey & kaymak, olives, tomatoes & ricotta salad, nuts & dried fruits, nut spread, homemade jams, warm bread.. All made at the resto except for the bread, which I can say is out of this world, I could't stop asking for more! The Beef, veal & lamb börek, pine nuts was out of this world..  The Service was exceptional, super friendly and explained everything clearly.  Only downer was the white napkin. Could be a poor  set but it left lint all over my pants and my friend's dress. Maybe it's time to change them.."}
{"text":"Great place !! Best experience in Montreal!! Highly recommended!! Thank you for great service and delicious food  !!"}
{"text":"So many mixed reviews about this place that I had to try for myself and see where all the discordance laid.   First off, the setting calls for more of a group outing than an intimate date. Long tables where you are seated directly next to your neighbour. The space between each patron is adequate but there is no 'official separation' between each seating.   Very nice touch to overall atmosphere as there is an open concept kitchen where you get to see the head chef at work as she finalizes each dish and ensures the platting is up to her standards.   Diversified menu with many interesting choices. Now here is where I think the discrepancy lies. All items are priced between 10-15$ or so, some are really worth it (especially the ones listed lower on the menu aka heavier on the meat side) whereas the more veggie and fish oriented dishes really fall short of their price tag.  We started off with the zucchini flowers stuffed with feta. It was a delight to try as it's not something you often see in the Montréal restaurant scene, but two small fried flowers for 12 dollars is a bit of a stretch.  We followed by the Tuna lakerda, which was basically three pieces of tuna sashimi in a middle eastern flavoured marinade. Very disappointing ... 11$ for 3 pieces of thin tuna? It doesn't matter how flagrant the sauce was (which was on the weaker side)... but unless it's blue fin tuna, that's way overpriced! Then came the grilled eggplant topped with cheese. Very tasty but yet again, small and hard to justify the price for a purely veggie based dish.  Things did get much better from there on as we moved onto the meat dishes. We had the lamb tartar (less gamey than I would have expected, needed a bit more seasoning though), the lamb koftes (lamb meatballs - my favourite dish of the night - this was so good that if I ever went back, I'd order 10!) and finally the fried chicken (perfectly done, crispy and well seasoned batter).   Were we still hungry after this? No, but we found that it should have cost as much as it did.   Otherwise, the service was excellent as the waiter was very attentionate and knew his menu and wine list to every detail.   All in all, it's a decent restaurant with a good atmosphere and rather innovative menu for Montréal standards. If you go stick to the bottom half of the menu and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We were walking on Laurier street and looking for a place to have brunch when we stumbled into this place that I'd heard so much about. They serve a brunch menu at 14.50$ per person, offering you starters to share; a cherry tomatoe and cucumber salad topped with creamy ricotta cheese, some nuts, homemade jam and chocolate hazelnut spread and a Turkish spread that resembles butter (I can't remember the name) which was so delicious. You complement it with a dish of your choice. We had the French toast with chocolate and tahini and the lamb meatballs. Both dishes were tasty and the presentation is great! Staff is very friendly, explaining everything and making suggestions. I would definitely go back, maybe for supper next time!"}
{"text":"We came here on my birthday, restaurant wasn't full, probably 14 customers were there. For Sunday they offered a limited menu, server explained us the menu, we ordered 2 pides (flatbreads) and a kufta. The flavor of flatbreads were good, after we finished with flatbreads, we waited (restaurant wasn't busy) until we got our kufta, which I think would be better to get together because of small plate menu concept. I was expecting to taste really nice and flavorful kufta, but I was disappointed. First of all it wasn't kufta, it was just a small burger patty with some spices, and there was a lot of silver skin inside, it was very chewy. I would recommend to fix the kufta and make the service little faster."}
{"text":"This was definitely one of my favorite meals in Montreal. I was there for the brunch prix unique, which is amazing.   All the dishes come with a generous spread of honey and kaymak (sort of like clotted cream) - this was my absolute favorite, homemade jams and jellies, marmalade, nuts and dried fruit, olives, tomato and ricotta salad, and delicious warm bread.  On top of this you get a choice of an entree. I had the most delicious, savory lamb sausage, poached egg, braised fennel and cabbage dish. So good. My friend also had a delicious mackerel dish.  Definitely a must go!"}
{"text":"On the hunt for a different kind of brunch experience my friend and I decided to venture out to Mile End to experience Barbounya.  This meal served as my introduction to Turkish food, which is a particular cuisine I have never experienced.  The owner, Fisun Ercan, is well-regarded in Montreal's restaurant scene for bringing Montrealers excellent Turkish food so I was keen to try this restaurant out.  We sat on the terrasse which was well located right on the street.  This offered up a pleasant opportunity to people watch and make the most of the Montreal summer.  It was kind of small so it is best not to sit there if you are more than two people.  At brunch they have a small, focused menu that includes a tasting platter to be shared between your table and the choice of a main dish.  The tasting platter consists of dried fruits and nuts, olives, kaymak (a kind of clotted cream) and honey, jams and a tomato, cucumber and ricotta salad.  This was served up with incredibly fresh bread that they get from Arhoma, an excellent local bakery.  The kaymak was my favourite part of this by a long shot followed by the tomato salad.  Despite being soaked in honey the kaymak wasn't overly sweet and it had a nice taste and texture to it.  The ricotta in the tomato salad was homemade and they added mint to the salad which made it very refreshing.  The tasting platter was followed by lamb sausage served with a poached egg and a spinach-fennel side.  The sausage was huge and cooked to perfection.  I also found it very well-seasoned.  I also tried a bit of my friend's mackerel dish and they did an excellent job with the fish.  It was very tender.  The service was pretty good and it is clear that the servers know the menu well.  Our waiter was able to make some good recommendations to us.  The only minor snafu was at the end when we wanted our bills.  This part took a little longer than it should have and we had to flag down two different waiters before finally getting our bills and paying.  The prices were pretty reasonable for the neighbourhood.  The brunch platter was $16.50 and we got a ton of delicious food.  In fact it almost bordered on being too much.  I was able to polish off what I ate but I was really slowing down in the end.  Let's just say I left one happy customer."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch with a group of friends for a friend's bday. I like that it's not your typical brunch and I like that it stays open late. We arrived at almost 3 pm.   The menu is a fixed price of $16.50. They bring out of platter of honey and kaymak, mixed olives , tomato cucumber and ricotta salad (this was my favourite thing on the platter! It was so tasty!) , homemade spread (one is similar to Nutella) , homemade jam, and warm bread to share. The warm bread is really good and soft. My friends loved the honey and kaymak. Kaymak is almost like a cream cheese but more soft and creamier. It was good but I'm not really into sweets.  For main I had the trout gravlax. I thought it was going to be gravlax with a side of salad but it was really a big salad with pieces of gravlax and beets in it.  There was way too much salad dressing. The balsamic vinegar was so over powering that I couldn't finish my plate and pretty much just ate the fish and beets.   Good thing the drinks were good! I had the grapefruit mimosa and a couple of Bloody Caesars. The staff was very friendly. The bartender gave us a round of shots so that was fun!   I really liked dinner but I wouldn't come back for lunch."}
{"text":"If you're visiting Montreal, at some point you'll realize your body with need more to run on than crepes, foie gras and poutine. Enter modern Turkish spot Barbounya. It's located far from the tourist hordes in the Mont-Royal neighborhood and eschews the typical Montreal rustic style for a modern feel with high ceilings, exposed brick and communal tables. The vegetable and seafood focused menu is served in tapas-sized portions that are large enough to share with a few friends. Our server recommended getting 3-4 per person, but I would say five to six max for two people unless you order very lightly. Other than his attempt to expand my waistline, our waiter was very helpful in working us through a menu that includes many Turkish words and later in securing a taxi home.  Top Dishes:  Barbounya Ceviche: Barbounya (red snapper) is thinly sliced and served on a plate with tomato, chili and other spices. It lacks the overpowering lime flavor often found in ceviche and has some interesting Turkish accents instead. It's one of the best ceviches I've had and an absolute must order.   Ricotta Imam Bayildi: Imam Bayildi is a Turkish dish that involves taking an eggplant, slicing it in half and simmering it in olive oil with garlic, tomatoes and Turkish herbs. Sounds good. But the geniuses at Barbounya realized the missing ingredient: cheese. So the whole thing is covered in baked ricotta. I've never had a Imam Bayildi before, but I can't imagine anyone doing it better than this.  Zucchini Pancakes (w/ smoked mackerel): While I love pretty much anything smoked, the risk is always that the smokiness of saltiness overpowers the rest of the dish. This mackerel is light and low on the smoke flavor. It's great compliment to the tangy zucchini pancakes and salsa."}
{"text":"I went for Sunday brunch here and it was absolutely divine! I ordered the poached egg with potato croquettes and roasted vegetables - it was unreal. Everything from the charming service, the authentic coffee, and the inventive appetizer board that comes with brunch is excellent. Overall 5/5 experience! I'm dying to come back to try out their dinner menu."}
{"text":"My final stop for this year's MTL a Table event was to BarBounya, a restaurant I have had on my list for a while now. After having read so many great articles and reviews about it and its sister restaurant Su in Verdun, I figured if I was ever going to give turkish food a shot, Chef Fisun Ercan and her team were probably the place to really do it.  Compared to the more formal Su, BarBounya described itself as a Turkish tapas bar. The look of the room fits with that description. Most of the seating is along bars that go around the space. There are a few communal style tables as well. The style is a mixture of old and new where the old elements of a townhouse on the Plateau are blended with some more modern touches of lighting and decor. Your eyes naturally fixate on the beautiful bar along the side wall with the high cabinets behind it - housing the wine - as well as the open window into the kitchen where you can see the kitchen staff work their magic.    BarBounya did their MTL à Table menu a little different in that we were served all the items in the tapas style of the restaurant - the dishes simply portioned according to the size of your dinner party. I was not aware of that going in but frankly, everything on the menu sounded good so at least it eliminated any debating amongst the four of us in what we were going to order.  First service brought forth three items. First was kale tempura served with a spicy tomato sauce and some yogourt. I never thought I would enjoy a dish whose primary ingredient was kale but here we are. The tempura actually stuck to the leaves and created a crunchy exterior. The kale itself didn't wilt and kept some tenderness within the tempura coating. The spicy tomato sauce and the creamy cool yogourt provided some nice contrasting dipping sauces to use in conjunction.  Next was a salad of beets and chickpeas served with black garlic yogourt. Another big hit at the table - the freshness of the beets was a nice pairing with the crisp chickpeas and the subtle hit of garlic within the creamy yogourt. Another dish where the main ingredient is not an usual favourite of mine but it certainly gave me a further appreciation of beets.  Final dish of the first course was grilled octopus carpaccio. Outside of the contradiction between grilled octopus and carpaccio - yes I know people use carpaccio to refer to any preparation of meat thinly cut but to me, carpaccio means raw - this dish was delicious. The octopus was beautifully tender and fresh and a nice mixture of oil and greens to enhance its natural flavour.  The second course provided another three dishes to enjoy. The surprise hit was the barley salad with butternut squash, sun-dried tomatoes and nuts. A very hearty salad with the sweetness of the squash and the tomatoes working well with the earthy barley.  The grilled lamb Köfte with tomato salsa was exactly as I would expect - spiced lamb meatballs grilled beautifully. The tomato salsa provided a little freshness to the festivities.  The final dish was pulled pork served over an eggplant puree. The pulled pork was flavourful and tender but truthfully the star was that puree. Wonderfully smooth and creamy - the natural flavour of the eggplant came through so well without being overwhelming to the pork served over top of it. First thing my girlfriend said afterwards was that she wanted to try making it after we had it - the impact was that strong.  To finish things off nicely for dessert, we got some chocolate baklava and almond pudding. The baklavas were not overly sweet thankfully with a nice touch of chocolate mixed in. The pudding was creamy and smooth. The addition of the pistachio and pomegranate crumble over the top added some nice extra flavours. A pleasant sweet touch to end a wonderful meal.  BarBounya was a awesome experience from beginning to end. Every dish was enjoyed and devoured by myself and the rest of the group. Such a great usage of fresh ingredients all across the entire meal. Add to that some nice glasses of wine, a nice atmosphere indoors and nicely attentive service - props to our waitress for checking with my pregnant friend about the lamb - and you have a restaurant that definitely come back to much sooner than it took me to visit in the first place... and I suppose its sister Su is now higher up on my to-visit list now.   Cheers!"}
{"text":"This place has brunch that could compete with Cafe Byblos, one of my favorite. Set menu for $16 for such fine dining brunch is really a good deal. The fish is fresh and the lamb is well-seasoned. The appetizer comes with several kinds of home-made jams and a fresh feta salad - one of the most delicious feta i've tasted in Montreal! For drinks, they have a great selection of tea from Camellia Sinensis and the Americano was excellent!  The service is also very fast, just make sure you reserve because it was almost full-house when we walked in around 10:45am on a rainy Sunday. The seating is a bit too narrow for so much food (half of them are bar tables), but certainly manageable."}
