Unprofessional little girls working behind counter while waiting for the disgusting 11$ sandwiches that I got, 2 different costumers came back in the store to ask for items that they had paid for and did not find in their bags and has to come back for it after going home."}

The decor is nice and fresh... the staff could learn to smile a little"}
