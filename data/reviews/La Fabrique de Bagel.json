{"text":"My wife and I tried bagels from the other 2 famous places (which I've reviewed) and the thing that stood out was that these were definitely grab-and-go places, you get some bagels and take them home. Unfortunately for tourists, that means you're begging your hotel for a toaster or eating them raw. 
This place, however, will toast the bagel and put cream cheese on it for you. They also had espresso, which was just okay. They had a bunch of types of cream cheese, but I went with plain and was very happy with it. Anyway, if you're in downtown and in the underground mall place, this is a great spot to go!"}
{"text":"It was kind of hard to find, but we found this little take out counter-style bagel shop inside the shopping and business center. It was raining and we were in the Old Town area and didn't want to make it over to some of the better-known bagel places in the rain, so we found this place. 

We were pleasantly surprised! The bagels aren't huge, which means you won't be stuffed for the rest of the day. We just sat on the inner courtyard and ate our bagels and cream cheese with some other tourists."}
{"text":"I have to give this place a 5 for several reasons:  1) There was no line which isn't always a red flag, especially during the week 2) service was friendly and immediate 3) closer to where we were staying (actually right downstairs) than their famous competitors  3) lovely selection of cream cheese available like fig, herbs, or olive 4) perfectly sized, priced, and satisfying. There's even a great choice of sandwiches with same wonderful bagels!  Just wish they stayed open past 5pm :("}
{"text":"Mmmmm always throws me off finding good dining in the underground mall but this place is great! Easy going, quick and the bagels are absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"Good bagels. A friend told us we had to try Montreal bagels because they are different than what we have back home.  Glad we did.  Looking for this place led us to discovering the huge city underground that we were completely unaware of.  Holy Moly, we spent the rest of the day exploring, what a trip.  Anyway,  this is a solid bagel.  I took the advice of my yelpers and found a winner.  I had an everything bagel with garlic herb cream cheese.  The little bagel carried me through to dinner.  Crispy, chewy, everything you want in a bagel."}
{"text":"As a tourist from Los Angeles, I was glad to see this shop near our hotel.  Tried it twice so far and the bagels are GOOD.  Nice staff.  Have yet to try the two competing bagel stores that are well known -- but enjoyed La Fabrique!"}
{"text":"I was too excited when the store was under renovation cause in the Old Port, sometimes you just need practical and affordable food :)

Their concept is choose a bagel type and choose among the dozen spread flavors--everything from Ham & Cream Cheese to Blueberry Flavored!! 

I picked up a chocolate cranberry bagel to go but it was rather plain tasting with practically imperceptible chocolate and cranberry. 

I'll give this bagel the benefit of the doubt and try them again as they have bagel sandwiches, baked goods, coffee and tea, fresh juices etc.

[Update: May 9, 2017] So I do give them another try. This time I march up to their counter and ask for their best selling bagel and spread. The guy recommended the all-dressed  bagel and the fig cream cheese. Fig cream cheese ??? Okay... Not your typical flavor but I decided to give it a try! 

The chewy toasted bagel had roasted oniony bits, poppy and sesame seeds and paired with the delicately sweet cream cheese with a hint of fig was really satisfying, though I found it just a bit pricey at $4  (or maybe I'm cheap?)."}
{"text":"I had an everything bagel with cream cheese and what they say about the bagels in Nontreal is true. They are to die for! I tried the salmon cream cheese because I had never tried it before and it was very good but stronger than I was used to. Eating fish for breakfast is something I dont usually do. However that's on me. I would definitely try it again!"}
