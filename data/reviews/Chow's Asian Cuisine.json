{"text":"This is great traditional Taiwan food! The best one I can find in Pittsburgh. Very nice chef and service. I plan to come every week"}
{"text":"Ordered takeout. Service was good, but food was subpar. Not impressed with the flavor, but the portion sizes were large."}
{"text":"Because of its location, this restaurant is not well-known among the Taiwanese communities in Pittsburgh, especially for the Taiwanese students at Pitt and CMU. I was glad that I went there. They provide very authentic Taiwanese food, perhaps the best one can find in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area. The owner and his wife are very friendly."}
{"text":"There's $25 down the drain. Ordered General Tso's, shrimp lo mein and a spring roll. Very small portions. The chicken tasted weird, dark colored meat and sauce. The broccoli was inedible. Lo mein had tiny shrimp with tails on. Spring roll o.k."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Chow's and we definitely will be going back.  It is a cozy, intimate space and the owners are clearly very interested in offering their customers good food made from fresh, authentic ingredients.  I would recommend a meal here without hesitation!  Soup was very good, saut√©ed fish with ground soy beans was very delicate and super tasty.  A greens were amazing, too!"}
{"text":"Light, delicious food true to Taiwanese flavors in a cozy environment. The owners are very friendly.  I always order the arden lettuce (A?). It's light, juicy, and crispy. Who would have thought lettuce could taste so good?  You also can't go wrong with the braised pork on rice (???)?This fatty pork belly just melts in your mouth. A touch of cilantro lightens up the rich flavor.  The chef can make a whole range of dishes, including items not traditionally found on menus at other Chinese restaurants. My wife called a week ago asking if they served ??, sticky rice dumplings. The chef replied that no, they didn't, but that he would make them for us if we didn't mind waiting a few days. We just picked them up the other day, and like everything else at Chow's, they did not disappoint.  Visit Chow's. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place but it was a little dissapointing  the owners are great and friendly food fell a little sgort for me. Im glad i gave it a try."}
{"text":"Authentic Taiwanese food! Beef noodles, fried tofu and fish! Yummy!"}
