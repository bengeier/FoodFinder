{"text":"How can you run a business and not speak any English?? I called in to order for pickup and the person who answered kept saying \"hello? Hello?\" So I kept trying to say I wanted to place an order and then she said \"uhhhhhh\" then ANOTHER woman got on the phone, and once again, did not speak English, and couldn't help me. Seriously, if you're going to own a business in America, have at least ONE person who speaks English. I can't even imagine what would happen if I had actually gone into the restaurant. Wowww."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout from here, over the counter. Great fresh, tasty Thai food, prepared swiftly  and delivered with a smile .. and the friendly barman poured me a wine while I waited. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Okay, the taro boba was really good, especially because I've denied myself the guilty pleasure of all that sugar and saturated fat for years.  But the only reason I ended up with a boba drink is that Sala doesn't have any beer or wine on their menu, and I was really in the mood for a Tsingtao.   I'm not sure what the other reviewers ordered that was so spectacular to earn 4 and 5 star ratings.  My husband and I are vegetarians, so we're a bit more limited than the average omnivore.  We have a couple of standby Thai favorites, pad see ew and yellow curry with tofu, which makes it easy to compare dishes with the best Thai places back in Los Angeles where we live.  For those of you who love the smoky flavor of a great pad see ew, you will be very disappointed at Sala.  That's the best part of pad see ew and what gives it character.  Otherwise, it's basically noodles and veggies, which is what we got....except that they were very salty.  They were nicely cooked and well presented, the dish just didn't taste, well, very good.    The yellow curry was also prepared well, meaning that the veggies were cooked to the right texture, but the coconut milk base and curry didn't shine through because the dish was salty.    I'm disappointed that we had a mediocre meal at a place that got such high marks.  This review is just to catch the eye of an unsuspecting diner who might see the flashy overall rating and assume that Sala is a great choice for a delicious Thai meal."}
{"text":"Thank you food gods for finally taking pity on this area!  Good Thai food makes life so much better.  Saw their sign today and decided to stop in for take out.  It was a nice little restaurant with a brewery friendly staff.  Even offered me water while i waited for my food.  When i got home with my yummy snaking food i was in my happy place.  The pad thai was very very good and the drunken noodles with Thai Basil was perfect.  The heat was perfect too. A 3 is spicy, i personally would not order above that and i an no spice wimp.  I can't wait to actually get a chance to eat in, that's if my 8 month old ever lets me."}
{"text":"Love the fresh veggies they use and the boba drinks are a hit with all ages! BBQ pork and pad Thai are out favorites, our 5 year old even loves this pale and chose it for her birthday dinner. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"First time I decided to come here since I live right across the street, I walk in the guy says it's closed very careless and almost rude, it reads closed at 9pm I came at 6:30 so I guess I'll find someplace else, never comeback."}
{"text":"Amazing food and amazing service. I lived in Thailand for 3 years, so I know good Thai food when I find it. I recommend the coconut milk chicken soup as well as the drunken noodles. Explore Thai food at Sala Thai and you'll be hooked to its unique blend of flavors.  Oh and they have Boba, good Boba. Hard to find that stuff on the west side."}
{"text":"I have been here several times and really enjoy their food. Usually get pad see ew which is delicious and chicken in the red curry sauce which is really tasty. A little pricy but not as pricy as the chain restaurants at Westgate. Since they serve good food and its near my neighborhood, I don't mind."}
{"text":"Love this place! They always go an extra mile on the service. Food is amazing, real authentic Thai flavors."}
{"text":"I like this place a lot! And food is great specially the papaya salad. I love how there's levels of spicy. But I do have to admit that I have a bit of trouble understanding the waiter's english. But at the same time I forget about that as soon as I eat their food."}
{"text":"Tried Red curry on 08-jun-17 lunch, red curry was ok but no flavor in it. i used to try Thai curry's in different thai restaurants but this was just ok."}
{"text":"Great customer service. We stopped by and got the red curry, chow mein and the fried rice. Everything was delicious and very filling. This is my third time going to this restaurant and every single time I have been greeted by the friendly staff."}
{"text":"I am a yellow curry lover and they definitely have an excellent curry. They are basically on par with thai house, except I like the location a lot better right along the 51, and they are more generous with vegetables."}
{"text":"Easily my most favorite Thai food experience in the valley. I've been coming to Sala Thai for a couple years now and the food is always excellent, the service is great. Highly recommend you check this place out. My favorite is the panang curry. You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"5 stars for superb service  5 stars for the authentic and delicious food 5 stars for the nice decor   Faves: pad thai and fried fish in ginger sauce"}
{"text":"Very good Thai food for Phoenix. Looking forward to returning to try other items.  PROS:  1. All veggies and seafood were very fresh and tasty with the perfect amount of heat. 2. Nice waitstaff  3. Fair prices"}
{"text":"There is only one place to go eat thai food and this is just the place to go. Just an FYI... Their medium is what most Thai places consider hot."}
{"text":"Love this place !  Excellent curries, soups and fresh spring rolls.   Gave 3 stars because take-out portions were shamefully small."}
{"text":"Pretty delicious. Ordered the Green Curry, spicy level 4 was just a little too spicy but deliiiiicccciiious. Tried it as a 3 level and was great! Awesome Thai tea."}
{"text":"I thought the food here was amazing and the portion sizes are very big. The boba drinks were yummy too. Last, the young man (the owner's son, I think) was the most polite person ever. I will return for sure!"}
{"text":"I really liked this place, it sit in a quiet mall. Easy in and out. Nice interior decor. Very clean. Very good service. Ordered Spring rolls and pad see ew . it was very good. Can't wait to come back and order other menu items."}
{"text":"Went here because Little Saigon, one of my favorite restaurants, was closed. We figured we'd give this place a try, and my parents had been here once before. The food was decent. My drunken noodles were good, and pretty spicy (a good thing). I had some of my mom's pad thai with chicken shrimp, which was okay, but  a little too sweet for my taste and had 2 shrimp. Exactly 2 shrimp. The crab wontons were fine, but a little overcooked. They also brought out my food about 5 minutes later than my parents. The food was passable, and would've at last earned Sala Thai a 3. However, the service was abysmal. I got 1 refill of water the whole time I was there. I sat with my cup empty for long periods of time. With a spicy dish, water is a must. When we were all about finished, it still took them about 10-15 minutes just to bring the check. I'm not sure I would want to return unless the service picks up."}
{"text":"My friend has never had Thai food before so I brought her here to try some of the best Thai food you can find in Arizona. I've been to multiple Thai restaurants here and this is one of the better (maybe even one of the best) spots. Everything is made fresh to order and food comes out quickly. They love their spices and chiles here; everything can be made spicy to your liking (on a scale from 1-5). The staff are very friendly, polite, and kind. They fill waters often and remove any finished plates from the table.   My friend's totally obsessed with Thai food now and says she thinks the Pad-Se-Ew is one of the best noodle dishes she's ever had. The thickness of the noodles soaks up so much flavor. We loved it!"}
{"text":"We LOVE this place! We eat here at least once a month, sometimes more often. Their yellow curry is always delicious. My boyfriend loves spicy food and they make him sweat! :-) We always get good service here also so as long as they keep this up, we'll be coming back for more."}
{"text":"Sooooo good! This place definitely hit the spot. You have to try the Spicy Egg Bomb, it is exactly what I love about Thai food, spice and explosion of flavor!  This was our first time trying it and we were not disappointed, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Very good food and has some yummy options for vegetarians too! They are always super nice and friendly too!!"}
{"text":"Sala Thai does a great job.  Every dish I have had there is very fresh and very distinct.  I have tried the pumpkin curry with chicken and the green curry with chicken.  Both excellent.  Do not miss the BBQ Pork.  WOW!  The rice is cooked perfectly I might add.  Grab a blended Thai ice tea with boba.  Deelish!  Yay! I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Best pad thai I have had in a long time! My boyfriend loved the drunken noodles as well. I got the food to go, so my experience with the staff was very minimal. The guy who took my order and money was friendly and polite!"}
{"text":"Our office staff had lunch at Sala Thai this afternoon. As usual the food was excellent. I have been going their original one  located on 32nd st and Shea for years. I am glad they opened one on west side."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend are regulars here, we always get the same thing steamed rice, egg rolls, with the level 3 spicy seafood soup. We love this place, it is our goto place to eat!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing the people there are very nice the place is clean and the food is delicious! I love that they have vegan options. The Tom Yum soup is amazing and the green beans with tofu is a must try. It taste authentic and the decore makes you feel like you're in Thailand."}
{"text":"Clean Friendly Their Tea is so yummy!!!  Chicken egg rolls r delicious.  I usually Go late at night. I love the decor & authenticity.   Prices aren't very bad,& bathrooms r clean. Huge star for that one."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite place before they sold and got new owners. The new owners are very nice and respectful but the food was just so-so. In fact, I was a little disappointed.  I walked in and usually they have cloth napkins folded neatly in a design placed on every table. But this time, I saw paper napkins. The attention to detail was lacking IMO. So it took me just a few minutes to decide what I wanted. They had a Lunch Curry Combo. Being the curry lover that I am, I chose this for 12.79$. It came with red or yellow curry. Crab puffs. Salad and jasmin rice. I chose the yellow curry. I have a preference to it. It took a few minutes and my order came. It was hot to order. I thought good. But when I got home I found a wilted salad next to all my hot yummy food. Downer. I remember a time when this would have never happened.  The food tasted okay not the way it used to be. For these reasons I'm only giving it 3 stars."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Thai restaurants in the valley. It is small and quiet. They play very soothing music while you enjoy very authentic Thai dishes. I would eat here every day if possible. Their ingredients are so fresh and everything is just delicious."}
{"text":"A delicious, authentic hole in the wall! We ordered the Crab Puffs, the Hot and Sour soup (which comes out on a flame to keep it hot), the Pumpkin Curry and the Drunken Noodles. Everything was amazing but the soup was especially delicious. It was spiced perfectly! We would definitely come back next time we are in the area."}
{"text":"This place is pretty new (only been open for 2 months, but the family owns 2 more locations in Phoenix). The staff were all very nice and friendly, the restaurant was clean and well-decorated, and the portions are really big!  We ordered pad thai, pad see ew, and panang curry. I don't know if it's just me, but I actually didn't find the food that amazing compared to the places I've been in California. I enjoyed the flavor of the panang curry (although the beef was tough), but the pad thai was a little too sour for my taste (I like it sweeter), and the chicken in both noodle dishes was pretty dry. I also ordered the thai iced tea, and it came in a really large portion and the boba was good!"}
{"text":"Great food, clean, fast and friendly service. I usually get their yellow curry, which is some of the best I've had. The drunken noodles are also very tasty, fresh ingredients. Pretty cool that the owners give you some recommendations based off of your preference in asian foods. Have visited the restaurant during all times, and the service has not suffered. Give em a try!"}
{"text":"I have always loved this place , the food is great no doubt about it . Tonight I phoned in an order for a medium sized party tray , they accepted my order and quoted me a price but when I came to pick it up , it was a small size tray . I asked what happen to a medium size that I ordered ! The answer was , this is our only size.... But it's obvious that this is a small size, why didn't you tell me that you only have one size and for this size you're over charging me .   She didn't have an answer . I paid for it and left . This is the last time for me . Sorry, but there are other Thai restaurant and I don't mind driving farther ... And the noodle was undercooked !!!! What the heck !!!! I'm Asian I know how a cooked noodle taste like !!!! Really not only I got cheated on the price it's not even cook right !!!! Should I report you to health department ? Why are you serving raw food?"}
{"text":"Sala Thai was quite good. Between the two of us we had spicy beef, pad Thai and red curry. The meal was reasonably priced - $40 with tip and only water. Of the three, the curry and beef were best. The pad Thai was good, but the weakest of the three dishes and a little on the soft side. As I always say, this rice noodle dish is diabolically difficult to perfect. Service was nice. We talked for almost an hour after dinner and felt no push to get us out the door."}
{"text":"This is the best Thai food that we have eaten in Arizona, California, Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri, and Arkansas. Whenever we go somewhere (we used to travel between 280 and 300 days a year) we eat Thai food and usually try as many different restaurants as we can.   The spicy basil pumpkin is excellent as is the sweet sausage fried rice. Their coconut ice cream is amazing and so are the fried bananas. We normally don't eat dessert but tried one and now could easily crave it."}
{"text":"Pretty good place. Thai coconut curry is delicious. Not too expensive. The decor is nice too. Not necessarily the first choice, but last minute wanting Thai food this point won't disappoint."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I order take out from here almost weekly. It is the only quality Thai restaurant is 15 miles from our home. We enjoy the drunken noodles and chicken pad thai. We love spicy but a 3/5 is the highest we can handle. Food is always delicious and on time. Small location but quaint. This would be great for a low-key first date."}
{"text":"This was a pretty solid 3.5, but I just couldn't give it 4 stars. This is a decent thai option in an area with very few, but I'm not sure they'd make it across town with more competition. We were the only people in the place at lunchtime in the middle of the week, but that location isn't exactly a busy one for lunch. The menu here was huge, which is either a good thing or a bad thing, but we went with traditional favorites for our first visit. Our coffee boba was yummy and the food was pretty good, but not great. My pad thai was a bit sweeter than I liked, but hubs loved his drunken (spicy) noodles. The service was all right, but a bit inattentive since the person was a bit too interested in her smartphone. Overall I might come back again but there are other thai places I'd rather go."}
{"text":"I will give service 1 out of 10. Food gets 4 out of 10. I was not impressed at all.   It started when we walked in and the 14 year old server didn't speak to us. Sat us down and never asked what we wanted to drink. Brought out water and walked off. Then went back to eating and doing her homework at the next table over.   An older server was at the same table coughing up a lung and was obviously sick. That wasn't comforting sitting there listening to that.   So finally we get our food. Let me tell you they are fans of vegetables. My girlfriends soup was a bowl of broccoli and some soup broth.   I ordered the Thai fried rice. Never asked me if I would like it spicy or medium or mild. Well when I took a bite I realized there was no spice at all. What Thai restaurant uses ZERO spice?  Food was extremely bland and service was horrible. Will not go back."}
{"text":"Amazing potstickers! I was so happy to find this little gem so close to home. Love the food and the people are so sweet"}
{"text":"My Sister and I were driving by hungry on a weeknight, saw this little booth filled place and went in.  The service was friendly, beautiful and efficient.  They make seriously delicious Thai tea, spring rolls and pumpkin curry.  The food came out with cloth bird of paradise fold napkins on fork stems and fun different coloured plates.  The dining room sported Asian style carved wood decor and an Asian song & dance show on the TV.  I'd recommend this place for take-out, casual meal or an intimate date."}
{"text":"No, they are not the best at anything... BUT, they are good to great at everything.  Their boba drinks have well cooked boba and a good texture (this is huge if you are a fan), their green curry is up there with my favorite.  I'd take the green curry over the pumpkin curry any day as I thought the pumpkin curry was decent but not at the same level.  Their pad Thai has a vinegary note to it, not necessarily bad but not the taste I look for in my pad Thai.  Overall they are very friendly and the cost is very reasonable so if you like Thai food you can't miss here."}
{"text":"Where does one go in the West Valley when the craving for exotic Asian food strikes but Chinese super buffets won't cut it anymore?      Since we moved to Phoenix, I noticed more and more people are turning to Thai restaurants to get their Asian food fix and for good reason, too. Thai food appeals to more than just the sense of taste. It tantalizes the eyes and nostrils even before the first morsel touches the taste buds.      Traditional ingredients in Thai food includes Pik Kee Noo (Thai chili peppers), garlic, lemongrass, lime, tamarind juice and Nam Pla (a translucent reddish-brown fish sauce made from anchovies, water and salt and allowed to ferment for a year up to 18 months).      We visited our neighborhood Thai spot, Sala Thai, located near the intersection of W. Glendale and N. 75th Avenues in Glendale and just a few blocks away from the Westgate entertainment district.      Owner Sam Pluemjit and his wife Somsaun opened this Sala Thai, their 3rd location, in June 2012. They came to the U.S. in '93 and worked in a factory for nearly 14 years before opening their first Sala Thai restaurant on N. 32nd St in Phoenix. Opening the Thai restaurant wasn't an impulsive move nor did it happen overnight.      \"The whole time we worked at the factory, we did a lot of catering, serving Thai-style food,\" Pluemjit said.      From his early catering days to his current Sala Thai location, Pluemjit works with recipes he learned from cooking with his family in Thailand. He leans toward the spicier offerings on his menu, favoring traditional fare such as spicy seafood, spicy green beans, spicy basil leaves and yellow curry.      We started our meal with the chicken satay, chicken marinated and grilled on a bamboo skewer. I'm a huge fan of street food and eating this made me feel I was walking the streets of a bustling Asian city and soaking in the sights, sounds and tastes.      Our next course was soup and Pluemjit recommended the coconut milk soup or Tom Kra Gai. Chicken is cooked in a broth of coconut milk with tomatoes, onions, Thai herbs, mushrooms, lime juice and lemongrass. This fragrant and filling soup, served in a hotpot, could easily have been our one and only course for the evening. I loved how the coconut milk smoothed out the citrusy tang of the lime juice and lemongrass. Order this dish if you're feeling under the weather or want to warm up on a cool winter evening.      The rest of the menu is divided into sections offering a variety of dishes for whatever you happen to be in the mood for. The noodle section includes crowdpleasers such as Phad-Thai, rice noodles stir-fried with chicken, shrimp, eggs and bean sprouts, and Drunken Noodles, consisting of big, flat rice noodles with mixed vegetables, Thai peppers, basil and choice of chicken, beef or pork. It's somewhat spicy but packs enough flavor to make you think twice about putting that fork down.      The entree section offers meat, vegetable and seafood dishes. Some dishes are mild while others are spicy for the brave foodie to enjoy. Spice Seafood consists of catfish chunks with squid, shrimp and fish ball (similar to meatballs but made with fish and boiled until it achieves an elastic texture).      A couple years ago, my wife and I \"beta tested\" a dessert Somsaun made, consisting of ripe mango slices laid on a bed of sweet, sticky rice and topped with sesame seeds. I'm happy to report Somsaun has fine-tuned the dish and it is now a regular item on the menu.      Overall, Sala Thai stands apart from other Asian restaurants, offering no-kidding Thai home cooking that appeals to the senses."}
{"text":"The thai food here is authentic in my book.  Fresh, fast, and tasty.  I've had the red curry, green curry, and a green papaya salad and all were great dishes.  A tad on the pricier side for lunch, but I like to support local eats and this one is definitely deserving of my patronage!  They make a decent Thai Iced Tea as well ;-)"}
{"text":"Wow! First time coming here the other night for my friends birthday and we were delighted to have chosen this place for dinner.   Drunken noodles and pad see ew, both made to order to our liking. Our server was super nice and friendly. Place was quiet and very clean. Prices were very reasonable, $2.5 for Thai tea and I think $5 for mango and sweet rice dessert.  They have boba too!  We were the only ones there when we arrived so I was a little scared, by a few more people came after us.  I would say food is 4-4.5, service and environment is 5! Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"really good place to go, authentic asian food and tasty tasty pad thai! and thai tea boba :)"}
{"text":"The last time I dined here was about a year ago and their tom yum seafood soup is still excellent with fresh lemon grass, ginger, fish, shrimp, mussels, and squid. I would also recommend the rat na and pad thai, although the rat na's portion is a bit smaller. Although their thai spicy is not what I would consider very spicy, it will do for Arizona."}
{"text":"We found Sala Thai a couple of months ago, and are real fans. We try to go as often as possible! Love the spicy eggplant, and the Thai iced tea.. we used to live half a block from there and now live much farther but it is worth the drive. I would highly recommend, especially those of us on the west side looking for good food in a relaxed and comfortable atmosphere."}
{"text":"This will not be my to go to Thai place.  I am not saying that it was disgusting. I did eat my pad thai.  I did not like the spaghetti thin noodle.  I like the flat noodle.  My dish had more egg that was disguised as chicken.  So maybe I had 2 small flattened weird pieces of chicken and 2 shrimp.  I did not order anything else because lunch prices were like dinner prices. I did happen to see some reviews on PBS and I think it was quite exaggerated. I don't think I will be back. There has to be another thai food joint out here..."}
{"text":"I love this place, it's clean, staff is friendly, and the food is delicious! I lived years in the neighborhood without knowing this place existed! Best Thai food  place I ever tried! I would recommend giving it a try!"}
{"text":"Cute little place with amazing food.  I dont know what took me so long to check this place out. The spring rolls were the best I've ever had.  Fresh and full of flavor.  The drunken noodles spicy level three hit the spot on a chilly night.  The staff was very friendly and patient as we had a table of eight.  I can't wait to try the other dishes.  I didn't pay but the dishes were a little pricey for the smaller portions.  This was my second time at a Thai restaurant in Phoenix so I'm not sure if they prices were standard for that dish.  Either way I'm going back."}
{"text":"I usually order red curry.  My friends get the pad thai and seemed pleased.  My son likes the beef satay. They don't have an americanized kid's menu so it was difficult to find something my son would like.  The server was kind and patient. He even gave my boy a toy!  I always order thai tea."}
{"text":"I cannot express how much I love this place. Every time my husband and I come here, we always receive fantastic service and the food is always delicious. They cook their dishes according to your liking and that's what we like about them. They are always flexible to what we want and never once complained. Best Thai food restaurant ever!!!!"}
{"text":"Great service and good food tonight. Had to happily add a star. I totally recommend. Be sure to ask for the spicy condiments if you like it spicy."}
{"text":"Sala Thai,   To begin, contrary to reviews the service was exquisite. The woman serving us was extremely accommodating and had a smile on her face for the entirety of our meal. On top of this the food was outstanding and priced reasonably. The drunken noodles, pineapple curry, and rad-nha are delicious. If you like good food and good people eat at Sala Thai, definitely.   Yours truly,  Michael Link"}
{"text":"Great service. I've only been here once, but I will be coming back to try other things on the menu. The Chicken Pad Thai was great. Restaurant was very clean."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Great owners. First time coming and will definitely be back. I recommend the fried banana with coconut ice cream."}
{"text":"Ive been here a few times and always enjoy what I try.  Usually the pad Thai or coconut curry.  My family loves to meet up here and always enjoys their meals.  Even the little one (2 years old) made little concoctions with white rice and spoonfuls of curry or sauces mixed in."}
{"text":"WOOHOO.... The food and SERVICE was GREAT.  We had he chicken satay, so tender and great flavor, loved the cucumber sauce.  My wife said the Orange chicken was the BEST  she has EVER eaten...  Nice flavor. I had the pumpkin curry with pork and vegetables was very good too. We cant wait to return!"}
{"text":"Initially concerned because restaurant was empty for lunch. Ordered spicy basil fried rice & curry chicken ..there HOT is really HOT, which is rarity among Thai restaurants."}
{"text":"Great food & presentation. It's a small restaurant in a strip mall area but it's decor is authentic and it felt comfortable. Though my son ordered red curry and ended up with yellow curry he liked the taste so no complaints."}
{"text":"I will say that the Thai Tea is the best I've had in Phoenix! The food is on the play side. The pad Thai wasn't the best the noodles were super sticky, I couldn't separate them at all. The Thai fried rice was delicious. & the beef yellow curry was on point!"}
{"text":"Good Thai food with HEAT!  So, my wife and I love us some Thai food.  Saw this location in a Phoenix Magazine article and stopped in when visiting family nearby. Was a good visit and reminds me of a small Thai restaurant from back in Hawai'i.    First, good boba teas always make a meal better. My wife and girls though the boba were cooked perfectly and the flavors were yummy.  From there, the noodle dish my wife had and the fried rice my daughters enjoyed all hit the spot. I had the Sala Thai noodle dish and asked that it be very spicy. Even though I ask, I'm used to restaurants giving me something barely mild. Not here! They truly game me a good mix of heat and flavor-- perfect for clearing out the sinuses.   The wait staff is very young and I get the sense this is a family-owned joint. The crew even appeared to have dinner together at the back table when we were wrapping up and paying. We're very cool with that family small-dining experience."}
{"text":"Tried this place on a whim tonight. My husband wanted Thai food, and my exact response was, \"you KNOW how hard it is to find good Thai around here...\". Boy, was I wrong! Sala Thai did not disappoint! I had red curry with double todu and my husband had the pa-naeng curry with beef. Both dishes were stellar! We rounded out our meal with Tom Ka Gai soup and Thai coffees. I'm so glad we found this little gem, definitely going back next time I get a craving for delicious Thai food!"}
{"text":"So very happy this has recently opened up in our neighborhood.  We are huge fans of their food! Very fresh ingredients, served with pride by very friendly staff.  This will be our go-to place for Thai for sure!!!!  Try the Mango sticky rice dessert and the Boba smoothies for a treat!!"}
{"text":"Just ordered some take-out chicken pad Thai. Granted it was nothing spectacular, it was some quality pad Thai and I was happy with my decision. What really makes this place five stars is the ladies running it. I ordered online and when I arrived they hadn't even seen the order but they felt bad and had the order up ridiculously quickly. They were very sweet and the whole place is obviously a family run endeavor. Great option for Thai food in Glendale."}
{"text":"I really love this place come once a week to get my fix. This is a small place, very clean, and the people always have a smile for me. For me it's the little things like bringing me a cup of tea or glass of thai coffee, or just plain water for me while I wait for my order. I don't know if they do this for everyone or because I've taken the time to build the relationship, but I really appreciate it. And the food is great. It's fresh and prepared with love. Everyone I've introduced this place to have made it their go to Thai restaurant."}
{"text":"Kind of a diamond in the rough since it is a small place in a strip mall. We had pineapple curry and pumpkin curry. My wife ordered 1 for a spice level (out of a 1 to 5 scale) and she thought that \"1\" was just the right level of spice since she likes mild. I got \"2\" and my nose started running but it had good flavor.  The server was very attentive and on the ball with water refills and answering any questions.  The portions were fair for the prices and for two of us including a good tip was under $25.  We really liked the dining experience and would love to  come back."}
{"text":"Amazing food no joke literally everything I ate had it own delicious unique flavor. We gor the veggie tempura and potstickers for apps. Then as entrees we got the spicy pumpkin basil w pork and the sweet Thai sausage. I honestly almost couldn't stop eating the sausage it was that yummy. Our drinks were our desert we got coffee milk tea and thai tea both w delicious honey infused boba. Come here any chance you get it worth the trip"}
{"text":"Sala Thai is a local Thai eatery with another location in North Phoenix.  While this location is pretty small and unassuming from the outside, it really has a lot of character once you step inside.  It's clean, has traditional Thai pagoda roofing decor, and oh so charming!  My normal go-to favorites from Sala Thai are the Duck Curry, Mussuman Curry, and the Pumpkin Curry.  If there was a way to combine duck, the pineapple chunks, the peanuts, the potatoes, and the pumpkin from the three curries listed, it would be the best curry ever.  I'd name it:  THE CURRY OF LIFE.  Oh my goodness!  *hyperventilating*    The food is delicious and fresh but I wish the portions were a tad bigger for the price I'm paying.  Sure they serve everything in huge bowls and while I do love to slather curry sauce all over my rice, I wish I had more veggies and protein IN the curry.  The friendly service makes up for the humble portions though.  Definitely stop by this little strip plaza gem and give it a try!"}
{"text":"A pretty solid Thai restaurant. They are within walking distance so even if I find that some other areas may be better it is easy to just stop in.  The food was what you'd expect. Flavorful, can be spicy, and comforting without sitting like a lead balloon. Not anything to write home about but definitely pretty good. If you are in the area, this may be worth a trip if you are not interested in heading into old town Glendale."}
