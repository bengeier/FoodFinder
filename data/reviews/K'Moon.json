{"text":"Well that was disappointing. We ordered $50 of food for 2 people: the grillades mixtes and the lamb tajine. Wow, where to start? Scantly portioned, dried out and cold meats in one container with a small child's handful of cheap salad tossed in. There were supposed to be two other salads, if the first can even qualify, and we received only one.. A small scoop of stewed vegetables, maybe half a portion. The lamb tajine was ok, but again the accompanying salad was a half scoop of stewed vegetables. The sides of rice and vermicelli were provided in regular sized containers, the size you might expect from a Chinese restaurant, only they were half full.  It felt like we got whatever was leftover as they were closing, maybe they hadn't made enough food for the day. Cheap quality, small portions but expensive?! Really nothing redeeming about this place. Skip it and take your business elsewhere and you'll be happier for it."}
{"text":"The food was not bad. We ordered the sandwich, vermicelli noodles and cous cous to pick up. For the price we paid we received a lot of food. They were sold out of many of the dishes when we called so accommodated by recommending other dishes that were not on the menu. The food was not phenomenal but definitely was palatable. My friend loved his noodles. They were very similar to kugel."}
{"text":"Très déçus !! Nous nous faisions une joie d'aller manger un bon couscous..Nous avons eu de la semoule blanche et un bouillon qui n'avait aucun goût et des carottes et 2 patates. Je retournerais chez Berbère à Montréal"}
{"text":"Delivery Service:  Ordered two chicken dishes, one with rice and one with vermicelli. Although the receipt reflected what we ordered, the order itself was very wrong. Instead, we received one of the chicken dishes that we ordered, but a lamb dish for the second; two vermicelli dishes and no rice. Ironically, the chicken was overcooked, while the lamb that we did not order was good."}
