{"text":"Excellent experience at Mondo tonight for a birthday dinner.  The service was excellent, attentive without being overbearing. The decor of the restaurant is very tasteful, simple and elegant. Our food was excellent -- Beet/Goat Cheese Salad and Chicken Supreme in a reduction with fingerling potatoes and greens beans for me, and Caesar Salad and Flatiron Steak with mashed  potatoes and asparagus for hubby.  They have a prix fixe menu with good selection .. 3 courses for $40, excellent value. We have a few favourites in Whitby, including Marca and Brothers. Mondo is definitely now added to our \"favourites\" list. Worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Always amazing. Great atmosphere, food, drink and service. Recommend the crab cake, beet salad to start. If you love wine talk to Rob to set the night right."}
{"text":"a total touch of class, beautiful renovations ... the food has never let us down, in the high end restaurants and the decorations reflect this.  Food has always come perfect.  I am the picky one and my steaks are always great."}
{"text":"I've come here on a number of occasions for my dinner talks and i love this little gem! Their food is always super delicious and the service is always great.  I\"ve tried their crab cake, delish! LOVE their seafood pasta, it is so good that i manage to convince my 5 other coworkers to try it next time we went back :) I've also tried a number of their desserts, including tiramisu (so good) and creme brulee - make room for this baby because it is HUGE! but they use vanilla bean in the dessert so i LOVE eating this! Their chicken is also surprising SUPER juicy,and not dry at all, and their beef is always done RIGHT, which sometimes it's very hard to get even at a steakhouse. It's really sad that they are changing the restaurant again as they can't seem to keep up the business with fine dining (not enough of a niche here i suppose). The owners also own Amici in Whitby and Pickering which is also just as good :) Love the atmosphere and the amazing food! Gem in hiding.. will miss you~"}
