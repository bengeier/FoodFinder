{"text":"Patino;s Pizza Restaurant  14304 Puritas Ave, Cleveland Ohio 44135
We ordered at 6:54 pm. on Friday 9/8/2017 Ordered 2 orders of chicken tenders, My  wife ordered 6 jumbo wings plain, no breading and a lg. fry, 
We got our order about 40 min later, Tenders were not bad, my wife ended up getting 6 BREADED wings, sauce was spilled all over container wings were supposed to be plain, sauce on the side. The Fries were supposed to be a lg order, we got a Small order of fries?
Called Pizza Shop Back, owner said he took my Wifes order, and said this was what she ordered. I told him i was sitting there when she ordered her Food, Owner said this is what she ordered, I told him we would never order again from his Pizza shop. He Said fine And Hung Up on me. 
In the Future i  Will never order again.
The Pizza Delivery Driver AL Came back to my house a 1/2 hour later with new wings for us. After telling his Boss that he was wrong about our Order, AL works Part Time, Who is a Military Veteran. The Owner doesn't Pay him but 30-40.00 a Night under the Table. Not Hourly??? And Pays no money for his Gas, Not even Minimum Wage???? Whats right with That?????
Owner says he Don't Care About No Veterans. I Will Not Order From There Again.

My Concerns for AL.

{"text":"Finding decent NY style pizza in Cleveland has been a multi-year quest for me.  I finally found it here and at Capri's.  Lots of people know about Capri's, but Patino's is hidden west side gem.  

Crust: Absolutely phenomenal.  Perfectly chewy, brushed with (I think) olive oil & garlic, snowy white inside and just the slightest crisp at the edges.  Best crust I've ever had in Cleveland.  10/10 

Sauce: Not glopped all over the pizza--sparingly applied in true NY style. A tad bit sweeter than Capri's, though not overly sweet. I prefer tangy to sweet, but this is a good sauce, personal preferences aside.  9.5/10

Cheese: It's good, real cheese, not too much, not too little.  Can't really go wrong there. 10/10

Toppings: I usually go plain cheese, but got salami this time because I love salami on pizza, and most places don't have it! 10/10

Price: Under $20 for an 18 inch 1 topping excellent NY style pizza.  ($15.99 for the pie, $2.99 for the topping.) Right in line with Capri, very affordable, and considering how hard NY pies are to come by in Cleveland, WELL worth it.  10/10

Final verdict: 99.5/100.  Don't be put off by their admittedly pretty shoddy website and hole in the wall location. Best crust in CLE!"}
