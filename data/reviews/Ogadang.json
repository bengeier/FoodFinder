{"text":"Very nice cozy bar. Great selection of sake, shochu, beer. Small plates but tasty!!"}
{"text":"Very cute and quaint little place. It is a bit hidden from the Main Street so it can be hard to find. The interior is dim and decorated with European/vintage style furnitures. The menu is quite small with mostly pub foods. We ordered:  - chicken skewers with green onion 3/5 chicken was tender but overall bland  - chicken mayo don - 4/5 pretty good! Good to share between 2 people  - yaki mochi  - 3/5 interesting, mochi was a bit hard tho.  - enoki pork skewer -3/5 again a bit too bland   Okonomiyaki  - 5/5 the best item we ordered! Surprised to see Hiroshima style okonomiyaki here since most of them is the regular Osaka style one. Was really good and portions were good!  Good place to chat, but bit on the pricey side."}
{"text":"Nice hidden place for Korean and Japanese food. Good selection of sake and yakitori. Ordered the chankonabe, was pleasantly surprised to see how much ingredients it came with."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed ourselves here!   This is a new spot in the Yonge/Sheppard area. The waitress said they've only been there for about 2 months and I'm upset that I've even waited this long to try it out!   We were warmly greeted upon our entrance, there were only about 3-4 tables occupied but the weather was pretty bad so that can be why it wasn't busy. The restaurant is pretty interesting looking. It kind of looks like an old Irish pub, dark wood paneling, simple chairs and tables and then a cool platform area where there are cushions to sit on, I guess this gives it a Japanese vibe, but overall it looks like an old bar. Definitely strange but oddly inviting. The music is relaxing and service so was friendly that, without trying the food I'm already planning my next return.   We ordered a couple of yakitori skewers and the calamari and we really enjoyed everything we were served. The yakitori really tastes like the real deal. Everything is very simply seasoned but you can taste the beautiful smoky, charcoal flavour come through on the various meat and vegetable items. My favourite was probably the chicken wings. They also bring you some pickled cucumbers and cracker sticks which were nice little side dishes.   The only reason I'm not giving this a 5 is because of the price of the other food items. The yakitori we found to be quite reasonable, at around $4-$6 for 2 pieces for most of them, some of the seafood ones were a bit more. The other items on the menu were a lot higher even so than most restaurants in the area with similar items. We would certainly come back for the yakitori though, it was amazing.  They have an extensive list of sake, soju, and beer to enjoy. I can see this being a great place to hang out after dinner or after a movie. They are open quite late and the ambiance is great for a late night snack and get together with friends.  Overall I'm excited to come back to this place, it's a bit quirky but worth checking out!"}
