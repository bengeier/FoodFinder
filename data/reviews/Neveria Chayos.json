{"text":"Me gusta mucho los esquites de este lugar deven probarlos they are bomb! Los cacahuates de las botanas sometimes salen rancios por eso los evito pero todo lo demas esta de poca"}
{"text":"Folks this place is LEGIT! GREAT Mexican snack foods. I haven't gotten anything that wasn't very good. Probably a little tough to find now as their is construction in the parking lot. Also a Greyhound bus stop that they're right next too. Try the Pina Loca if you're with a friend. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Neveria Chay'os is highly recommended! Sweet employees and clean location. They have about everything you can think of when you're craving a nice Mexican treat. Their menu is huge giving you many options to choose from. Prices are reasonable. I've been here twice and each time I'm pleased with their customer service! Must try!"}
{"text":"Hands down best place ever! Very good customer service and everything on the menu is just absolutely delicious. I would highly recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"The best Mangoton ever!!!
This place does not disappoint. Fresh ingredients every time. 
Come in and try for yourself!"}
{"text":"Awesome fresh strawberries and cream and the owner was so sweet. It's in a corner in the plaza and with the drive."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! Very healthy choices! My favorite is the Piña Loca. Everything is always fresh & clean. No long lines. They are always willing to custom create almost anything you want. Definitely a Latinas favorite place."}
{"text":"Dos estrellas porque los antojitos la verdad si estan ricos, pero no doy mis 5 estrellas porque las viejas que trabajan alli a todo el mundo reciven con una cara de pocos amigos y con un actitud. La unica persona que es amable es el señor que trabaja alli. Si van a trabajar con clientela, almenos traten a la gente que esta gastando su dinero con mas respeto o mejor dediquense a otra profesion. Nomas porque no esten teniendo buen dia, no quieran amargarle el dia a todo el mundo"}
{"text":"Una amiga me recomendó este lugar , tienen literal mete todos los antojitos mexicanos , nieve , fruta , aguas frescas , chips , fresas con crema , raspados todo esos antojitos que conocemos  , toda la comida es fresca , esta súper limpio , los dueños son muy amables . Les recomiendo 100 % este lugar a todos !"}
{"text":"Ordene un raspado de limon y recibi un raspado de azucar, colorante verde y un limon. Mi culpa por no haber preguntado si eran naturales. Regresaria a probar algo diferente pero el servicio es malo les falta servicio al cliente o de perdida ser un poco amables."}
{"text":"I love this place they have the best elote and its cheap super friendly and if you like milk shakes like I do then thus is the place made with trify ice-cream they have like 15 flavors then they have all of the Mexican Dulce's too I come at least ones a week bad thing is iam getting fatter"}
{"text":"Every time I order here I get the right order in a reasonable amount of time and friendly service. 
I recommend the tostielote,tostilokos and that mango smoothie is dog on great. One of my favorite Antonito spots in phx. Keep up on winning."}
{"text":"Special request to get this! Ask for blended Mango smoothie and request chamoy to be added. Do NOT order chayada (it is an ICY with mango \"syrup\" at the bottom and chamoy syrup at the top with mango bits and chamoy sauce added too) It is not the same!! I ordered it by mistake and had them changed it what this picture is. It's really good! Trust!! They also add peanuts on top, but I dont really care for them. Request them to take peanuts off if ya not a fan. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"this is the 2nd time i come to this place.  i had the strawberries & cream, i added coconut. it was really good and the strawberries were real fresh. i would go back again & again :)"}
{"text":"Best antojitos place!!!! Authentic with a HUGE menu, I had a hard time choosing just one thing. I got the tosti-elote with a limón raspado and they were both delicious!! Would definitely come back here again!"}
{"text":"This place has everything you could ever crave as far as Mexican snacks. I got the elote entero and my husband got the nachos and we shared a pina colada. Everything was delicious and the staff was very friendly. They got our snacks out quick too. I will definitely be coming back and bringing my friends and family here."}
{"text":"The food is amazing and the service is great. I would bring anybody who is craving some Mexican snacks here"}
{"text":"Omg best place for cravings...I truly recommend this place. Everyone is so nice and polite. I will definitely will be coming back, muchas gracias"}
{"text":"We came here for a healthy treat. My wife got the Jugo Verde and I got the Mango Passion. Big mistake! It was made with a sugary syrup and was the consistency of a slurpee! So much for ordering off their \"healthy\" menu. It also had salty peanuts on top which was gross (??). I couldn't finish it because it was so sugary! Oh well, we tried something new. You win some you lose some. The staff was friendly and I might try coming here again."}
{"text":"This location has great customer service and all their snacks are so good. The place is always clean."}
{"text":"So delicious!!! Definitely one of the top antojitos places in Arizona. The customer service is amazing and the owner is the sweetest man you'll ever meet. I recommend trying their tostielote or just a typical elote or chamoyada. We live an hour away and will gladly make the drive over because it really is THAT good"}
{"text":"Lo mejor en antojitos mexicanas a este lado de la frontera. Nosotros estamos encantados con su manera de atendernos. La piña que ordene con estilo cocazo estaba deliciosa, el día Viernes de la semana pasada. Muchas gracias, pronto nos veremos por otra con el favor de Dios."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Workers are very nice and accommodating. Very sweet and just overall pleasant to deal with!!

On a Saturday night it was VERY busy, line was long but they were churning out the food left and right. So the wait wasn't bad at all.

The quality of food is perfect with very few slip ups!"}
{"text":"I love this place so much, It's my definite go to! I have tried almost everything on the menu and it never disappoints! Lines go fast and you receive your food very quickly as well. Staff is always friendly and willing to give you suggestions"}
{"text":"Wow! So fresh, ripe, and sweet! And right in my back yard! I have watched customers go in and out of this small location in the strip mall and always wanted to try this! So glad I did! Can't wait to come back and try everything else!"}
{"text":"This place is my new fave dessert place. The staff is super friendly. The food is sooo goood and not too expensive. I love it."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time yesterday and it was awesome!!! I had a fresi-nieve and my son had a snowcone...I will definitely be back to try something else new. Definitely recommend this place to anyone looking to try some amazing Mexican treats."}
{"text":"I've looked for a place like this in Phoenix before and they have all disappointed. I searched for a raspado place again and came across Chayos and decided to give it a try. So glad we did. The place is delicious and had a great variety of treats to choose from. I had the Tostielotes which is an awesome twist to the nachos, and the Mangoton with fresh mango and spicy candy. Def recommend."}
{"text":"Soy de Los Angeles , no se pero cuando mire el menú no encontré la palabra MANGONEADA!!! Creeanme pero estaba un poco asustada como primera vez no sabia que ordenar. Tuve que dar mi propia receta de una mangoniada pero ni asi logré atinarle a mi mangoneada !!!! Ese rapado de mango tenía demasiada azúcar o mieles artificiales nada de lo autentico!!! Estaba tan triste!!  0/5 puntos para este raspado!

Aparte ordene unos tostilocos con todo esos si estuvieron buenos , no me puedo quejar! Gracias! 5 estrellas!! 

Finalmente un esquite grande con todo desabrido!! Nada de color en el elote! ?? No tenía color y estaba bastante duro ( NO MADURO) hubiese tomado un ejemplo y luego ordenar !! Lo único que hizo justicia a esto era el queso cotija mayonesa y el chile en polvo! 0 cero estrellas total!!! 

Si quieres diabetes al máximo con el raspado y un esquite desabrido ven aquí!! 
Además el monto total: 2 raspados grandes unos tostilocos chicos y un esquite grande $21.00!!! Era demasiado para algo que no tenía sabor y huyendo con una experiencia fatal !"}
{"text":"Love this place!! The sandia loca and the chayad are SO damn delish. And excellent customer service too!!!"}
{"text":"I really love the antojos and all but the service here isn't great honestly, they're very unorganized, and it takes SO long to get your order. I understand they get busy but they have enough staff to get orders through."}
{"text":"Wow! This concept is great for our AZ weather almost all year round! Ice cream,fresh fruit and the best AGUAS FRESCAS! And the family that runs this chain is the most hard working and sweetest people I have encountered. I love that it's a small family operating business! So if your looking for a light mexican snack or treats this is your place!!"}
{"text":"Staff is super friendly and helpful. They have a great variety to choose from. I got the pina loca and it was huge. Very delicious. You gotta try this place out."}
{"text":"I tried leaving the review on the location that is on 67th ave and bethany home but they dont have it.BUT Let me start off with the bad. CUSTOMER SERVICE IS HORRIBLE. Ive been here 3 times already and i get the same attitude each time.and by the same girls. They dont welcome you or even say thank you .They take their sweet ass time making the raspados as well VERY SLOW SERVICE on a SLOW day, each time i came there was just one other customer there. Also they dont give you receipts. I asked for a cup of ice cream with two scoops,they charged me and they only gave me one scoop saying i paid for a one scoop icecream,so i had to pay an extra dollar, so how am i supposed to know what she charged me if i dont have a receipt? . The girl somehow got bothered and went to the back and didnt finish our order and had the other rude girl finish it herself. Other than that, the antojitos are really good  and i would like to keep coming back to better custlmer service."}
{"text":"The place is great everything is so fresh! The staff is super helpful. I recommend you to try the Mangoton it is so delicious. Also congratulations on the new expansion the place looks great."}
{"text":"Order Tostitos preparados to go, I suggest you eat there, the chips get all soggy. Overall, the flavor was good."}
{"text":"Very friendly. Mango passion was so good. Best I've had in Phoenix. Will be coming next back. Even my mom approved of this place."}
{"text":"Had a great experience the first time, second time not so much. The short chubby girl in the front was super rude and had a nasty attitude. Not coming back."}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend were randomly in the area on our travels when we ran into this place. I gotta say it was super great. The place was clean and the food was incredible. Great Mexican dishes, plus they had Asian dishes as well, not to mention all of the desserts they offered. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"After a long walk and yoga workout I was feeling in the mood for a large smoothie.  I have tried the chain smoothie place and the boosts or whatever the heck those are gave me terminal flatulence!  All other chain smoothies seem just - Meh.  Then you get the hard core juicer bars where many a slender urban hipster hangs out.  Not knowing the menu makes their eye roll so hard you can hear it.  So I looked up smoothie places in Yelp and found that there is this one only about 2 clicks down the road.  I went.  Nothing fancy or pretty but a lot of neighborhood people there.  Saw they had plenty of fresh fruit, Thrifty ice cream and such.  The menu was in Spanish but the gal at the register helped me and I got a mango smoothie.  Got to see them prepare it with puréed fresh mango, ice and syrup.  Very organic tasting and exactly what I wanted.  Took it to go as the place was packed!"}
