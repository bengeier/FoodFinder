{"text":"Food has improved! Wings are still meh, but the club hoise was awesome!! Service is still so-so, but we always get looked after."}
{"text":"The Kilt and Caber was set up as part of the cartoon setting of McKenzie Towne, but has become much more. Mac-Town, as the kids call it, is the strangest part of Calgary with its faux-European design, complete with \"downtown\" street names like High St. and the like. Luckily, my cousin is the mayor of Mac-Town, and I've been able to look past the over-crowded insanity of the place to find a few gems like the Kilt and Caber. At first glance, it looks like the typical \"neighbourhood pub\" facade. But through some strange coincidence of money and location, it has become the place it seemed to be pretending to be. On weekends, the place is as crowded as the community it's in. Beer is spilling everywhere, the game is always on and you can barely carry on a conversation at times. But that works to its advantage. The people are real and they're actually doing something right. The food is great and I've never had a bad meal there. On a fateful, less-crowded night, I got into an argument with the barkeep over the proper pour of a Guiness, which he told me was too difficult considering how busy it was. A quick glance around produced no evidence of this (on a Tuesday night there were maybe 20 people, compared to the hundreds that usually show up). But the locals assured me the man was decent at heart and meant well, so I let it go. It's a Scottish-themed place after all and perhaps he was trying to make a point.... In any case, the Kilt's servers are top rate, even when it really is busy. And yes, they all wear kilts. Their homestyle meatloaf is one of the best things on the menu. One dark night I was actually able to finish the whole thing. I give the waitresses top marks and actually look forward to my sojourns to that \"Olde\" pub, despite the bastardization of the English language in that \"Towne\". Something real exists in a place that tries its best not to be real...."}
{"text":"The food here sucks. Mind you, I'm not a wing gal, so I can't give my 2 cents about em. It's hit and miss if you get a friendly waitress. Lame-o."}
{"text":"A few years ago, (quite a few when I come to think of it) I would have given them a four or five star rating but they've gone downhill, and continue to do so. When Brewsters came into the area they had competition and needed to get on their game, but sadly they didn't. Food is horrible - horrible, overpriced and I used to really like it - nothing more than good pub food but that was all I expected. Everything is a bit run down feeling and the service is jaded at best. Really ticked me off when we went downtown during stampede week and the place was dead - they had cancelled wing night, put out a very limited expensive menu and no drink specials -come on you're down in McKenzie town not next to the stampede grounds! We up and left and went to Brewsters and had buck off burgers with the rest of the crowd."}
{"text":"I frequent this place with my friends or my wife. The menu is just OK but the wings are great. Plus they have very good daily drink specials. I'm going to think twice next time I'm heading out. My wife and I stopped in for a drink and the waitress could not have worse. She messed up our drink order, then when we finished the drinks we ordered another round, when I ordered, she said \"you're telling her what to order?\" Yeah, maybe if you didn't screw up the order in the first place. I even took responsibility for the screw up even though it wasn't my fault. We we asked for the bill, she had the nerve and audacity to insult me directly to my wife's face. Guess what? The Toad & Turtle is opening next week. I will be going there. The Kilt is no longer the only option. There's lots of places now and my money will be spent elsewhere. Management needs to seriously evaluate their staff. Occurrences like this cannot happen. On to THE TOAD & TURTLE."}
{"text":"A great place to be, food is tasty and reasonably priced. Lots of big screens to watch the game. Very friendly stuff. Could use a face lift in my opinion."}
{"text":"My friend and I were looking for a neighbourhood pub for a quick bite to eat after an afternoon of painting pottery. To our delight, Kilt & Caber was literally two doors down from us. It was fairly busy when we arrived, but we found a table immediately and our server was quick to come by.   Our server was very eager, which I totally respect. But when you are coming to our table every two minutes until we decide on food and drinks, it can come off as trying to rush people. Also, we asked what the drink and food specials were and she had no idea. Honestly she was very nice and meant well. She was just a little inexperienced.   I ordered the burger that was on special. For under $10, it was a great deal. The burger was cooked nicely and I loved that they have curly fries as a side option. They were also cooked really well. My friend ordered a buffalo wrap. However, they accidentally brought her a burger. When she brought it to the server's attention, she was very apologetic and was quick to bring her the meal she ordered. Once she got her correct meal, she was happy with it.  Overall, I have to agree with the other reviewers. It is a neighbourhood pub. Not exactly standing out from the crowd. It will do the trick when in need of a filling meal, but there are some kinks service wise that need to be sorted out."}
{"text":"I live in this neighbourhood and have been here on multiple occasions. It is what you expect. It's nice if you just want to have a few drinks, some food, and chat with friends. On busy nights service is slow. It is a bit of a dive bar in my opinion. They often allow obnoxious, annoying, drunk people to stay there even though they should be kicked out. But if you have no problem telling people who act like children when they're drunk to get lost you should have no problems. The food is better then you would expect. Quite good actually. On busy nights they should have more staff on the floor.   All in all, if you want to have some drinks and fun with friends it's good. But if you want class and excellent service, not the best place to go."}
{"text":"A favorite chicken wing destination in South Calgary. With wings nights on Tuesday & Wednesday (20¢/25¢) it's a great spot to settle in with some friends and make a giant pile of bones.  I've tried every flavour - including the new Kilt Habenero which were good and hot so if you like spicy try these out.  While they're not the biggest wings they are always cooked well and have great flavour to them. Add to that a cool pub atmosphere, lots of big screens to watch the game on and lots of space (although it does get *packed* on some nights) and you're set.  The Kilt also has a new sister pub even further South in Cranston now called The Berwick. I'll review that one next. Nom!"}
{"text":"If last night was any example of the atmosphere and service I will never be back. Service was beyond awful for everyone in our group. I stood at the bar to get a water (was DD) and stared at 5 staff j just standing there for 5 minutes before I got served.  The servers on the floor were much better but the behind he bar staff were awful.  Wasn't even busy so no excuse for being so painfully slow."}
{"text":"Great food, love the bar staff, love the servers. But the washroom smells like a morgue on a hot day. For the premium food and booze prices I kind of expect a little friendlier toilet."}
{"text":"Their staff friendly and the service out standing. Wed. Is wing night 25 cents in plates of 12 drink specials all week long. Good place to meet up with friends large area."}
{"text":"We were here for the fish special really great deal and tasty :)  Comes with lots of fries and slaw. Get the two piece is super great deal"}
{"text":"I really enjoy the ambiance of this place but the service is terrible.   A couple of waitresses are ok but the day staff is terrible and about 1/2 of the evening staff is terrible.  They will literally walk by you and ignore you as best they can. Maybe they haven't figured out that more drinks might equal a higher tip percentage or higher dollars.  The food is ok, not great but not bad either.  I like this place in spite of itself. Imagine if they tried!!"}
{"text":"Last night my friends and I went to the Kit & caber for wings. I've eaten here before and had a normal experience. Server came, we ordered drinks, brought the drinks, we ordered food, brought the food, checked on the food, brought the bill, paid, left. Not last night. There were 7 of us out for a friend's birthday. I'm aware of how busy it was--but should customer's expect terrible service at a restaurant because it's wing night, which is busy, like every Wednesday wing night I'm sure. The server took our drink order, and when she came back to order the drinks, told us that we didn't seem ready to order because people were standing around the pool table--we were ready. She then told us she would give us a few minutes and come back to take our order. She did not return for 20 minutes. When she brought our food, she could not FOR THE LIFE OF HER, distinguish between the different kinds of wings. We became fed up after 5 minutes of trying to figure it all out and just told her and the assisting server to leave the wings and we'd just figure it out ourselves- because honestly she was just a really mean person . One friend was missing a plate of wings, and the server, extremely obnoxiously came over to ask what we were missing. She then tried to explain we were not missing any wings, which we were. Her attitude was extremely rude throughout our entire time at the restaurant. I consider myself and my friends very laid back, easy to please people. I have never once in my life not left a tip for a server. I have served and am aware of the importance of tips for a server, her tip out, etc. The entire time her attitude made us felt like we were just in her way by being there. I had to get out of my seat to ask her for a water and a keiths , and she rolled her eyes and just stared blank eyed, finally responding \"Okay, so what do you want then?\"... I can honestly say I have never been treated so rudely by a server in my life. To be frank she was stuck up, and made it very cleary she didn't give two sh*ts about customer service. I myself have been working in customer service for 8 years. I've seen the best and the worst. I am sure we are not the only customers who have left feeling this way."}
{"text":"Fun place to hang with friends but don't have grand expectations for service or food. Food is terrible but doubt you're going there for the food. If the servers know you, then you might get better service or you can just go to the bar where you will wait a while but you will get a drink eventually:-)"}
{"text":"Just tried the new menu .... same as the old , bland.   The only  changes appear to be the new pricing  system.  My beef dip ($13) with caesar salad , ($2 upcharge) needed extra beef ( because it's always  light) needed  an upcharge  of $6 . So by the end it's  $21 for a beef dip .  The draft ( as usual ) tastes off as if the lines are rarely  cleaned .  Service  is hit and miss .  2 stars may be generous,  but it is close and it's not always  bad . Shame that the management can't seem to get better out of such a great location."}
{"text":"I went tonight to watch game 5 of the Stanley Cup playoffs against Nashville and Pittsburg. I love to watch games at this place because they have so many TVs. Anywhere you sit you are definitely going to get a good view.  Last time I came here I got a curry dish which I was very disappointed with but I should know better than to order curry from a bar. If I would have written a review after that visit this restaurant would have received a 2 star. I was also disappointed because the curry was my second choice. I originally wanted to order the \"East Coast Style Donair\" but they were out of ingredients when I tried to order.  I decided to give it another try and this time was able to get my \"East Coast Style Donair\"and it was so delicious. I like this menu item because it is something most restaurants don't have and it was layered with beef. I would highly recommend.  They had great drink specials as well ($5 unique beers that were there own recipe) that my boyfriend got. I however got a b blueberry and strawberry mojito that I just got back from drinking by the pool at the flamingo hotel so I was very happy with my drink choice!  The couple sitting at the table by us also got the donair. However, they also got a $150 coupon when they left which I was upset that we didn't have the opportunity to receive and I was curious why and the table in front of us was definitely getting checked on more frequently than we were. I'm not sure if they were regulars or not but they were getting special treatment for sure and that is why this place is getting a 3 star. Not for food but for service which is another important factor."}
{"text":"The beer can be pricey, the food is alright, the service seems to be hit or miss. Sitting at the bar, it would take a few minutes to get noticed, but one time we decided to take a table, the waitresses wouldn't even make eye contact. We waited for about 15 minutes without a server even coming within 20 feet of our table so we ended up leaving and going to another pub. But this place is close to home, so one tends to forgive."}
{"text":"With daily specials and fun prizes during major game days, this is the place to be. It serves a lot of its locals and provides the best service they can.  The bar staff may not be Tom Cruise from Cocktail, but they'll certainly try and make the place more like home for you.   The wings are typical on wing day, which is why I suggest you try Monday nights for their dry ribs. Or pop on in on a Saturday for a Kilt Burger and watch some local music."}
{"text":"Walking into the Kilt & Caber I was immediately impressed with vibe. Clean, bright and comfortable; I thought, this is the perfect place to catch the game or hang out with friends.  We were only seated for a minute or so before our server asked us what we wanted to drink, we actually had to ask for menus as they weren't offered.  Our pints arrived and it took only a sip to find my first disappointment: my Guinness was flat. How does a Scottish pub serve flat Guinness?   My usual pub fare whether it's Irish, English or Scottish has always been fish and chips (always with that pint of Guinness), and I am rarely dissatisfied, but alas, I found myself wondering how messing up this meal was even possible. The fish was soaking wet inside the batter and tasted freezer burnt. I would have said something to our server but we barely saw her after she figured our bar tab was not going to be epic; in fact, she never even asked how everything was or come by the table with the bill (I did see her flirting for tips at a larger table of heavy drinkers), but sent some random person to collect our money.   I'm bummed because this place looks amazing on the inside, has a great atmosphere and vibe, but a flat Guinness and crappy fish and chips with poor service? We won't be back."}
{"text":"I gave Kilt & Caber two chances, and experience was consistent - \"meh\". Not really \"eww\", but certainly \"meh\"...  Sticky tables? Checked. Stench in the air? Checked. Worn out furniture? Checked. Pitifully brief choice of beers? Checked.  But what really kills the place is clientele - think Hells Angels wannabes - and service. While bikers are occasional, service is consistent - and consistently slow. As in - slow motion! With the room half empty it took me from twenty minutes to half an hour from seat to get food.  And kitchen work is actually pretty good, by the way - not something to crave, but quite reasonably good. Even servers were rather friendly when they helped - keyword is \"when\", though. That felt like once in a lifetime opportunity.  So I'm disappointed by the place - was ignoring it for a while, then had a chance to try, and oh well... Frankly, I'd recommend Brewsters (just around the corner) instead of Kilt & Caber for a bar choice in the area."}
{"text":"Good spot with live music on weekends. There is also 2 golden tee set ups for some interactive fun.  I also give the beer menu a 7 out of 10 for selection. Staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Decided to pop by on wing night after having some serious wing cravings.  No, I'm not pregnant, I just like destroying hundreds of wings most of the time. It's wing night, AND Red Wings are playing San Jose.  It's actually not insanely busy like all the pubs anywhere during a wing night, let alone a game night.  It's not too noisy either, I was happy to be able to hold a conversation. The service was good, the server came by just enough.  I was also happy to see the beers, whether domestic or import, were in the 6 dollar range. See? THAT'S how much you should charge for beers. The wings on the other hand were just meh.  Don't get me wrong, I destroyed them, but the flavour was lacking. The saucy wings weren't saucy enough and the dryer wings weren't spiced or flavoured enough.  My roommate (husband) had the buffalo and they weren't saucy, just like orange coloured fried chicken.  25 cents or not, I want good wings damnit!  When I wiped my face with the lemony moist toilette I thought that had more flavour.  Flavour my citrus pepper wings were lacking.   I'll definitely be back for beers (cause beerz r awesome), but probably not for wings :("}
{"text":"I love this quaint, little neighborhood pub. Really great food and the staff is always friendly. Smokehouse meat sandwich is wicked, awesome!"}
