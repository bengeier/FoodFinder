{"text":"I used to work at Lemar's pizza when it opened, so not only have I experienced being a customer but an employee.   This is Bradford's Pizza GEM!  The owner is very strict with hygiene and the freshest product I've ever seen on pizza.   There is no skimping on toppings and this pizza truly is a party in your mouth!!!!  Definitely a 5 star pizza! You have to try it!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in town. Prices are fair and the service is friendly. If you haven't tried this place do yourself a favour and do :) they also have the sweetest delivery guys and girls."}
{"text":"Probably the most FILLING pizza I've ever had (THAT'S A GOOD THING)! Taste and service was great! I'll definitely be going back :)"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service over the phone very rood people! Called to order pizza, they asked me to spell my address and when they were not happy with my spelling they just hang up."}
{"text":"I eat a lot but one slice fills me up great place nice people I stop in on my way to Barrie"}
{"text":"The pizza I ordered was ready when I picked it up. It's a 20 km ,20 min drive from door to door. I ordered the med 3 topping pizza which came to 12.98 taxes in. To be fair I ordered my pizza half cooked and unsliced, but this is my usual way of doing things as I like to finish my pizza at home ,baked in my own oven on a pizza stone.  I have attached 2 pics ,one of the entire 12 inch med pizza half cooked, and one totally finishe'd just out of the oven.  Firstly I have to say the topping were over abundant and they did not skimp in the least. The dough was perfect and the tomato sauce a little sweet. Overall there pizza is far superior to any chain I've tasted. I will return again. Well done Lemars."}
{"text":"Yep..... Best pizza place I've been to. Ingredients were fresh, pizza sauce is perfect and always cooked to perfection. Definitely Bradford's hidden gem!!!"}
{"text":"This is awesome pizza !   Worth the drive from Etobicoke!     2 large pizzas with 6 toppings & 4 pops!"}
{"text":"Best pizza place ever , if you are looking for a high quality , fresh pizza this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Not just another \"grease wheel\"!  It is so easy to get bored with pizza when it is thin and sparse and lacking in flavour.  So it is with many of the chain pizza joints, so I decided to try Lemar's on the recommendation of K.K.  I stopped in and looked at the menu.  Very basic, with a few standard options and the ability to build anything you want.  I chose a 12 inch with ham, bacon, pepperoni, mushroom, black olive and extra cheese, on a thin crust.  During the easy 15 minute wait, the first thing I noticed was the owner hand stretching the dough for my crust!  Outside of New York or Chicago, I rarely see that!  My pizza was ready.  I paid a mere $15, and left the store. As I headed for my car, I noticed that my arm was getting tired and sore.  This pizza was HEAVY!  I opened the box and discovered the reason my arm was tired-this pizza is massive!  It had to be a full inch high, loaded with heavy toppings.  And the flavour!  Every bite contained every ingredient and lots of it.  Normally, when a pizza is this full of wet toppings, the crust turns to jelly.  My thin crust was crispy and light, not a carb loading that comes with so many other pizzas.  Another surprise was the flavour.  Lemar's used a spice mix, probably including caraway and fennel for a very unique and addicting flavour.  I normally can polish off a 12 inch pizza from anywhere by myself.  I stopped at half of this one, I was stuffed!  This is a pizza that will last two full meals, what a deal!  This place is so typical of single owner operated restaurants.  Take out only, with a very dated waiting area, and friendly, smiling owners who are eager to please and impress.  I was both!  I can't figure how they can make a pizza that big for the money they charge and still stay in business.  They obviously care more about the customer than the profit margin."}
{"text":"Best pizza ever! We drive all the way from Keswick for this pizza. Best in the area, by far.  Very generous with toppings, big selection and not too expensive.  Order ahead, it gets very very busy, but you won't be disappointed with your pizza. It's fantastic!"}
{"text":"Best tasting Pizza in town and best value. Great service you may have to wait a little but that's because they are busy. You can see it's a family run business keep the great food coming and service."}
{"text":"I've driven by this place many many times but never went in until yesterday and I've been missing out all this time on amazing pizza! The aroma of the place screams home made and delicious and the pizza doesn't disappoint!  MUST TRY THIS PLACE"}
{"text":"This is one of the best pizza places I have ever been too. If you love toppings on you pizza this is your place. They put on so many toppings it's almost impossible to eat without dropping half of them. You could probably top two pizzas with amount of toppings they put on one pizza. Excellent crust and good dough ratio. Not to mention they still do their garlic dipping sauce the old school way in the little clear plastic cups. I can't recommend this place enough and I will certainly be going back.  Great price too. It's worth the venture off the 400"}
{"text":"Hands down the best pizza ever!! The word \"pizza\" isn't even in our vocabulary anymore. It's just \"wanna get Lemars?\". And they deliver to River Drive Park! Also love the Mediterranean Salad, its huge and so fresh. I eat it for 3-4 days."}
{"text":"Here have the best home made pizza I ever have.  You can choose many kinds of meats, vegetables and cheeses on the top.  pepperoni, mushroom and ground beef are my favorite, it's mouthwatering."}
{"text":"Literally the best pizza I have ever had. I am a pizza lover and have tried many places all over the world. This place is something else!!! amazinggg food !! spinach gourmet is definitely me and my family's favourite . recommend this place to anyone looking for high quality pizza . I haven't tried the other food options but definitely will soon :)"}
{"text":"Ever since I've tried their Pizza - I cannot go back to any other.  Plenty of toppings choices, everyone can find something to their liking. Prices are okay, they have deals - so that's something worth considering, especially if it's a lot of people, since they have also sizes such \"Jumbo\" and \"Party Size\", which the last one I didn't try, but the \"Jumbo\"... Oh my.  It was so huge, my husband and I took three days to finish it.  Every bite is good.  The place itself is quite small, but I believe that the good thing about it, is that everything is authentic and their true to their agenda without being too commercial at all, and I like it.  It's like a boutique place for pizzas.  Go Lemar's!"}
{"text":"New place for us heading north. Nothing fancy, though chicken, garlic, sun dried, feta, red onion was a welcome choice for a ready-to-go slice. Family take-out place. Fresh fresh crust and great all round flavor in a traditional pizza. We'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"People in town rave about this place so I decided to try them. Ordered 1 large pizza..... Took almost an hour to be delivered. They  forgot to add the garlic sauce I had ordered, so the driver made  a second trip to bring it back. The pizza was Luke warm and barely any toppings. I honestly was disappointed. I'm not really sure what people were raving about, Abruzzo in Richmond Hill (Yonge and 7 area) is much better."}
{"text":"Our pizza joint of choice.  Makes you crave pizza night. Crust is good. Lots of toppings.  Great value for your dollar."}
{"text":"A staple family owned pizza joint in Bradford. They don't skimp out on the toppings so you definitely get your bang for your buck making it the best kind of pizza."}
{"text":"Great pizza.  The medium was BIG!  As mentioned plenty of toppings.  Great taste and value.  I will definitely repeat."}
{"text":"Best take it pizza in the area. They oven give a dip for free. Their gluten free pizza is one of the best according to my daughter.  Quick service.  They're very busy obviously because they all have my opinion."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town. Hands down. The thick crust pizza is super yummy if you like thick crust.   Toppings are always plentiful and the staff are always nice and courteous."}
{"text":"This Pizza is INSANE!!! They pile on the toppings and the quality is so consistent you'll fall in love... weekends expect to wait if you're ordering delivery... but it's worth the wait... trust me!"}
