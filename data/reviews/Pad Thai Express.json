{"text":"They serve lunch out of this food truck every day at lunch.  Lots of Pitt students, staff, and faculty stop by here to grab some food around lunch time.    Entrees are:  small-$4, medium - $4.50, large $5.50 Beverages are $0.50 for both soda and water.    They usually have pad thai noodles, teriyake chicken, pineapple tofu curry, chopped chicken basil, etc... There are usually a few specials posted on the window as well.   The Pad Thai is a little greasy and you can tell it has been sitting there for a while.  The food is not particularly good, but it's a pretty good deal for the price."}
{"text":"The owner is sweet! I think everything is great BESIDES the padthai, i don't know if i just got it on an off day or what, but the padthai I ordered was overly sweet and soupy. I didn't like it at all. I did order a basil dish that was absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"I work a block away from the food trucks on Bigelow, and I frequent there for lunch. I have to be up front and say that this truck in particular gets a bad rep from my coworkers, but I happen to really like it. I generally get the pineapple tofu and rice, which runs 4.50 for small (which is actually a more-than-fair helping) - add a $.50 soda and you have an enjoyable and tasty $5 lunch. The one drawback that gets a lot of flak from friends is that the food is precooked and simply heated until you get there (unlike a couple other trucks located on either side). Maybe I'm not picky about lunch food, but guys, these are food trucks. It's fast. It's easy. It's cheap. And those are pretty important things to me during weekdays."}
