{"text":"Bistro français avec une touche nord-américaine. L'atmosphère est plaisante, la carte des vins intéressante et le menu du midi approprié. Pour un lunch d'affaires ou entre amis, Holder est fiable et recommandable."}
{"text":"A very nice restaurant in Old Montreal. It felt like a place locals might go after work, and the food is very good. Definitely worth an evening."}
{"text":"The restaurant's decor is very fancy, so we initially felt underdressed in our casual clothing. However, the service was friendly and completely unpretentious. Our server offered great suggestions for food and wine pairings throughout the meal. We ordered the lobster ravioli and duck confit and paired them with the wines our server recommended. Overall a wonderful experience for a surprisingly good price!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Monday evening, it was very busy but the service was very attentive and the food was very good. My companion had the daily fish special - it was hake and was well prepared and a very nice looking plate.   I had the hanger steak which was cooked to my liking. The salad is very good sized and very fresh greens.   Try the chocolate truffles, they were divine."}
{"text":"Ok, this is what I call a great bistro. The moment you step in the smells of fine wine, grilled meat and sauté vegetables coming from the kitchen invigorate you. Their bourgignon plate is fantastic and their soufflé is out of this world. Impeccable service."}
{"text":"We have for a starter foie gras. For main dish classic beef tartare and lamb shepherd's pie. The food was amaaaassing....  The service was excellent. The decor stylish. This is a place to return and eat the a same dishes again (and if you can to try other dishes as well)."}
{"text":"A lot of good reviews about this restaurant and after trying twice I decided not going back.  The food is really just average. Service is definitely sub par.  The waiter usually disappears.  Calamari was ok.  Salmon tartare was average. A little under season. The yogurt sauce was not enough to make a difference. The braised beef cheek was mediocre. A bit under seasoned. Also. Short ribs could be probably better for the same cook method.  Why use beef cheeks ? potato purée was rather bland. The duck foie gras salad with poached egg was well designed with good flavor. But the greens are too little in proportion.  The chocolate cremiaux was probably the best dish among all. But there was almond bits in the ice cream that wasn't mentioned in the menu. And later they nervously denied there was any nuts.   Overall I think this restuarnt is over rated."}
{"text":"Steak on a Sunday! Took our reservations and upon arrival we were seated promptly. Great appetizers, and we both ordered a steak each. Unfortunately they were overcooked, and the floor manager came over and apologized profusely, agreeing with the fact and didn't charge us for the meal. Based on the fact that I had been there in previous years and always had great food and service, I'll easily go back!"}
{"text":"Came into Montreal and open the trip with a great meal and atmosphere. The hanger streak was great with fritters and onions. The buffalo mozzarella salad with shaved parm excellent  Awesome time and the capper is the wonderful staff and service"}
{"text":"Holder is worth going out of your way for. I returned for my second trip here and was reminded that its an excellent, albeit really large pub.   The wine list is fantastic, and they'll make you any cocktail you'd like (check out the beauty of a scotch list).   What sets this place apart is the food - I still try to recreate the endive, blue cheese and walnut oil salad I enjoyed here. Though we didn't indulge, the brunch plates coming out of the kitchen looked (and smelled) beyond words.  Staff are kind and service is quick. If you're in Old Montreal, this is a great pick for a casual yet refined dinner option.  In three words - HAVE BRUNCH HERE!"}
{"text":"Fantastic service and great food. Beef tartare and salmon carpaccio were heavenly. Loved it!"}
{"text":"I've only been here once, but I feel entirely comfortable saying that this is my favorite restaurant in Montreal. The food is delicious...I don't even know what a parsnip is (I assume it's some sort of vegetable), but the soup they made with it was very yummy. I also had the boeuf bourguignon with potato puree and green beans. The sauce was amazing. The whole experience was great. The food was good, the atmosphere was awesome, and the wait staff was even more wonderful--very friendly and attentive and seemed to appear as if by magic sometimes."}
{"text":"Dined here in the recommendation of a co-worker in Montreal.   Location was right outside Old Montreal on Rue McGill. We walked through the underground from downtown to Victoria and only had to walk 5 minutes outside in the December weather.   Atmosphere of the restaurant was nice. It was a large restaurant and tables were close but never had any hearing problems but at the time it was only half full.   My wife ordered the mussels and thought they were fantastic. I had the beef bourgagoin and also thought it was great. mine came with mashed potatoes which were great with the sauce. Hers came with fries that we both thought were great.   We thought this was the best food we had in our short Montreal and Quebec city jaunt. The two entrees plus tax and tip was $49 USD."}
{"text":"Fantastic food!!! The duck confit was the best I ever had!! Ever!!! Fish and chips was light and delicious!! The pineapple dessert was amazing!!! Dominic our bartender was helpful friendly and overworked!! Thank you Holder for our best meal while honeymooning in Montreal!!"}
{"text":"The food is exceptional and the service efficient yet warm and friendly. This is great for lunch but can also be good place for a family with well-behaved kids. French specialties like \"blanquette de veau\" are flawlessly executed and classic north-American fares just as comforting as you would expect. This has become a staple of every trip to Montreal."}
{"text":"Tilapia fish dish was delish! The hanger steak is also great. I see many customers ordering mussels that come with home fries & I can't wait to try that next time. Always call for reservations, i came in today thinking tuesday wouldnt be so packed but it sure was. The atmosphere is also very inviting & classy."}
{"text":"Went for lunch. The decor and area is good and service was good. I got the fish and chips and they were good. My fiancé got vegetable soup and that was decent, nothing special. Overall I would say you would be happy to eat here but not totally blown away."}
{"text":"Stopped by Holder for valentines brunch on recommendation of a friend, I couldn't have been more happy with my experience there.  Front of the house or \"Maitre D\" was pure class, I was reaching for my girlfriends chair to pull it out but he beat me to it haha! Aside from the jokes this place is great, service is top notch, food was tasty with good variety of choice & decor is upscale yet inviting.   I guarantee you will leave with a solid overall experience, a must try, from brunch to supper!   P.s location is great but logo of restaurant a bit hard to see, but definitely no biggie!"}
{"text":"An Old Montreal favorite, Holder is a beautiful French bistro that is always perfectly crowded. One of my faves is the Duck Confit with the truffle oil arugula salad. My friends are huge fans of the Steak tartar. This place is perfect for a big or small group gathering with friends. It's casual but trendy, so feel free to wear jeans with heels or your pretty little black dress."}
{"text":"Holder was recommended by our hotel, Place d'Armes, so I wasn't quite sure what to expect (Place D'Armes is very good hotel, btw) .  It was a Saturday brunch, and most tables by the windows were filled. We were two and the only tables even near the windows were for four.  He said that he had to ask the manager - and we were quickly ushered to the last table near the windows which was for four.  Our service was excellent.  The waiter was always nearby when needed and the busboys made sure we had water always filled.    I ordered the sundried tomato, spinach, and gruyere cheese frittata with baby arugula salad.  It was spectacular.   The Frittata was very flavorful, and the salad was beautifully dressed and actually a salad and not just a reminder of a salad.   My wife ordered the eggs benedict which comes with potatoes.  She asked to substitute the potatoes and they said no substitution but the waiter added that the potatoes were terrific and we should try them.  Well, the eggs benedict were good, and the waiter was spot on - the potatoes were fantastic - somewhat akin to scalloped potatoes, but lighter and tastier.    We complimented the manager on the way out, and he, Guiseppe Giampiccolo, gave us his card and was very friendly and asked that we call him to let him know when we would be returning.    Highly recommend Holder for Brunch, and look forward to returning to Montreal and trying for dinner.  I give it four stars for excellent Brasserie food - but for Brasserie food, it is  five star fare."}
{"text":"I visited Holder on a recent trip to Montreal. The service was top notch, the waiter was very friendly and accommodating, the crowd was in their mid-20s and the decor was on point. I had the Grilled Hanger Steak with Shallots and House Fries ($23). The steak was a perfect Medium Rare and the portion was adequate. I also had their Apple Cider ($6) however the portion was quite small. Overall an enjoyable experience!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite restaurant in MTL! We get the steak tartare, duck confit, steak frites- it is all incredible, flavorful and cooked perfectly. Always a stop here when we visit!"}
{"text":"We got the salmon tartare and foie-gras for appetizers, and the duck confit and beef cheeks bourgignon for dinner.  Everything was excellent.  The place is pretty loud so I recommend sitting at the bar because the tables are set higher and not as close together as the main restaurant."}
{"text":"The food was excellent, and so was the wine, but the absolute most memorable part of the meal was the Butterscotch Mi-Cuit!"}
{"text":"We were staying at the trendy Place d'Armes hotel in the Vieux Port/Old Montreal and only had one night in the city. We asked the concierge for recommendations for a semi-casual French cuisine restaurant in the area (we weren't in the mood for over-the-top dining at Club Chasse et Peche, Toque, etc). She recommended Holder. Absolutely fantastic! Food was delicious, all wait staff were very attentive, and price was extremely reasonable ($120 for 2, including $40 bottle of champagne, tax & tip).   We ordered cream of asparagus soup with crab and ham (great depth of flavor), beef cheek bourguinon (amazingly flavorful and tender), duck confit on a bed of arugula with potatoes, and fish soup (the only disappointment, since it was too fishy---think anchovy taste instead of a delicate fish soup). The waiter recommended a butterscotch tart/ice cream dessert---delicious combo of hot and cold!  We will definitely return on our next trip back Montreal."}
{"text":"It was good. Especially food was gorgeous. But also nobody care me lol............. Maybe i was look like backpack. But it's true lol I went to here even though heavy snow. But i was really satisfy and super recommend except their service."}
{"text":"We stopped in for drinks and an appetizer.  The calamari was just okay - borderline rubbery.  For a bar of this size, the bourbon selection was slim.  The waitress appeared bothered by us right from the start.  While ordering, she just exuded attitude.  The icing on the cake was the bill.  She simply tossed it on the table as she walked by.  I expected better - a lot better."}
{"text":"Amazing food! We have never been disappointed. We usually eat lunch here but this trip decided to take our teen daughters for dinner. The pate is divine - light and not too rich. The beef cheeks Bourgogne over whipped potatoes melted in your mouth. Get a side of wild mushrooms! The girls each had steak frites and as usual it was delicious. Their wine by the glass is always the best. Go!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I came here on a getaway weekend and felt like we were brunching with the locals.  It was busy, crowded and delicious.  We ended up taking curling with the next table over and enjoyed taking in the hues and costumes of the Montrealers the flock to this popular local favorite."}
{"text":"Our NYE dinner...amazing service! It seemed like a choreographed event with severs dropping in and out from our table, seamlessly. This was with 2 young children mind you. We went as a recommendation before the big party at Old Port and we were not disappointed. The food was delicious...just enough French for these Chicagoans."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch around peak time and got one of the last tables. Food was extremely good (even though the French onion soup was not as salty as I like). Had duck confit and fries. Lively atmosphere and friendly staff."}
{"text":"You had me at Hello! Il n'y a rien à dire. Tous mes soupers au Holder se sont soldés d'un vif succès.  Un bar pour les professionnels jeunes et moins jeunes, mais définitivement branchés!  Quoi de mieux que de déguster un tartare de saumon au yaourt de caviar en entrée en observant la jeune jungle urbaine parfumée et bien habillée.  Hop une bouchée de calmars frits au parmesan, accompagné d'un succulent vin blanc sec que le serveur saura vous recommander...  Assaissonner ses calmars de parmesan, une idée géniale. Merci au Holder pour toutes ces belles soirées.  Préparez-vous à payer le gros prix par contre.  Ça vaut la dépense."}
{"text":"Holder nous propose une cuisine variée, digne des bistros français BCBG. On y sert un tartare de boeuf tout à fait imbattable. Je n'ai pas trouvé un seul restaurant à Montréal qui ait compris comme Holder ce que signifie un tartare \"bien relevé\". Quand la plupart commettent un crime de lèse majesté en y ajoutant du tabasco, on est heureux de manger un tartare préparé dans la vraie tradition française.  On se régale aussi avec l'entrée de calmars qui ne baignent pas dans le gras, idem pour le fish &chips. La carte des vins est riche en choix du Nouveau monde et du Vieux continent.   Le service est symapthique et authentique, en ce sens que le personnel n'est pas blasé par le tourisme envahissant du Vieux-Port.  L'endroit est chic, très animé, un tantinet bruyant, avec une décoration cuivrée, soulignée par des miroirs style Art deco."}
{"text":"The past 4 years, I have gone up to Montreal for a little getaway and each time I have visited Holder. It has now become a must-visit everytime I am in Montreal. In fact, my past two trips I have been for Sunday brunch and went back at night for dinner...it is that good!  I just went this past weekend and everything is as great as I remember and each time I bring a new friend they love it just as much as me. The manager, Giusseppe is amazing. In fact, he actually remember me from my trip last year! That says quite a lot about the level of service and detail the staff put in here.  For this past trip, I tried the quiche for brunch which Giusseppe told me was a new addition to the menu. It was delicious. When I returned for dinner that night the place was packed. The staff were efficiently working their tables and service did not suffer which was quite impressive seeing how busy it was. The entire staff works as a team with the manager greeting guests and checking in on tables. I usually go with the duck confit which is incredible. Best duck confit I have ever had and it was actually my first duck dish a few years back when I first visited Holder. I wanted to try something new, so I went with the veal flank steak in a marsala sauce with frites. The veal was delicious. I 've never had veal so tender.   This place is a must try in Montreal. I have yet to have a dining experience in Montreal that has matched Holder. I can't wait to go back and visit again. Thank you Giusseppe for always a great experience!"}
{"text":"One of my preferred local restaurants in old montreal. Try the lobster ravioli or the salmon plate well done."}
{"text":"We were visiting Montreal from and went to Holder for our belated Valentines day dinner on February 18/12.   We ordered a nice bottle of wine, a steak tartare appetizer, and salmon dish and a mahi mahi special for mains. The food was fresh. However, it was busy, so sometimes empty plates waited on our tables and wine glasses sat empty while our waiter was MIA... Not a deal breaker though.   However - partway through our meal a waiter that was refilling water glasses tipped a full glass over and it landed in my lap. Staff were quick to respond and give us a new table cloth/chair etc... The waiter who spilled it, of course, sincerely apologized for the accident and directed me to the washroom where they had hand dryers so I could try and dry myself off. I was not impressed that they did not offer to comp us anything for this. Even a drink, dessert or the appetizer we had already enjoyed being deducted from our bill would have been an appreciative gesture. I instead had to spend the rest of the evening with wet jeans and we were left not feeling overly impressed.  We enjoyed the food, but we would probably try another restaurant before returning to Holder again."}
{"text":"Pleasant service, decent cooking, nothing to be overly upset about, but nothing to be excited about either. While the pricing appears reasonable, in light of the above, Holder seems somewhat overpriced."}
{"text":"Excellente nourriture mais service moyen. J'ai mangé la joue de boeuf et wow!  Elle était très tendre.   Nous étions un groupe de 10 personnes et on sentait tous une pression pour nous servir rapidement.  Notre serveuse n'est jamais venue nous demander tout était ok lors du repas.   C'était l'anniversaire d'une copine et ils nous ont spécifier que le gâteau était à nos frais.  Lors que nous avions terminé de manger. Nous avions le regard de tous les employés sur nous.  Ils semblaient avoir hâte qu'on quitte."}
{"text":"Loooove this spot! Best brunches, coffees, eggs benedict, lunch, anything you get will likely be delicious. Service is always on point. The look/feel of this place is simply the best. Huge windows, beautiful washrooms, glasses and plates are always clean, presentation is impeccable. Bring your clients from out of town here, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Nice French dining experience. We had the calf liver and duck confit. The liver was cooked well (pink, which gave it a soft texture and creamy consistency.) The accompanying mashed potatoes were okay, could've used more sauce. The duck was delicious, slightly overcooked for my liking. Fingerling potatoes were also a bit dry.  Service was great, food came out quickly."}
{"text":"I went there on a sunday morning for brunch, and I have to say I was amazed. Prices (at least for brunch) are reasonable, food is delicious, and the service is beyond perfection. Behind us was a large table with families, and it seemed to be a very kids-friendly place."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best meals in Montreal!!  We were traveling from Toronto, with our 11-month-old baby, but we wanted to eat well.  We were reluctant to bring the baby somewhere *nice*, so we called Holder in advance to get the okay.  I should mention that it was a Monday night, so I don't know if this is always the case, but they were welcoming and gracious.  The staff were incredibly friendly, and made a point of acknowledging the baby and giving her lots of attention.  They provided a booster chair with tray for us, which was a huge plus (those are definitely way better than the wooden highchairs, which allow baby to reach the table, and clear it of any food, hot drinks, and sharp knives, haha...).    As for the meal - mmmm!!!  Hubby had the steak frites, and calamari to start.  I opted for 2 apps for my meal - shaved parmesan salad and the French Onion soup.  Both of us would HIGHLY recommend our meal.  Awesome food, welcoming atmosphere, friendly staff, great vibe.  Thank you Holder!"}
{"text":"a classic.  Great service, wonderful food and a vast wine selection."}
{"text":"Recommended by a colleague and it is a winner! Good atmosphere and outstanding food! Service is friendly and attentive. Great for business dinners or a date night."}
{"text":"Funplace with Great food and service. Veal steak perfect! Fish lovely. Will definitely return the next time we are in Montreal."}
{"text":"I've tried many French restaurants in Montreal, but Holder is by far my favourite. Everything on their menu I've tried is delicious, portions are not tiny like French restaurants typically are, good wine selection, reasonable prices, and service is great. I highly recommend the salmon filet!  It's in a beautiful building and the setting inside is very nice, it's very fancy but warm and open."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Montréal. Excellent food & service."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this restaurant, but it just did not live up to expectations. The place is a large, boisterous French restaurant, which is cool. The atmosphere is upscale casual, which is great for most occasions.   The food however is where we are lacking. We started with the salmon tartare, which actually was quite tasty. It has fresh, light and well seasoned. For the main, I had the duck confit which was dry and tasteless. The skin was quite juicy. However, when you got to the meat, it was very dry and bland. The braised beef cheeks looked quite good. The portion size was large and the meat very tender. However, the flavour was still lacking. Once you got over how tender it was, you realized that it really didn't have much flavour. The tilapia was one dimensional in flavour. The lobster ravioli was actually quite tasty, but beware, the portion size is quite small.   For dessert we had the Chocolate Mousse with mocha ice cream. This is actually VERY good, but VERY dense. The coffee ice cream balances if quite well.   The service is good, but kind of rushed. We felt like they were trying to hurry us out, even though we weren't there long.    Overall the ambiance is nice, food is meh and prices are steep. I'd think twice before returning."}
{"text":"Tres bruyant  Bonne cuisine  Bon service"}
{"text":"Was referred to this restaurant by our hotel - Bonaparte Auberge - and was so pleased with the results. Upon arrival Holder showcases its blend of traditional service with a fun, trendy vibe. Food was great! I had the cold Foie Gras with pears and it was smooth and rich. Dinner was beef bourgignon - and i highly recommend this dish - very tender beef and the sauce was the best i have had. My friend had steak frites which she enjoyed but even more so loved the creme brule she had for dessert. Very much worth the visit - and probably some of the best service we saw in the city."}
{"text":"Excellent food, welcoming hosts, and beautiful decore.  We call an hour before we go. We were lucky to find a table for 5. The place is classical, neat, and clean. The waitresses and waiters were friendly, engaging, and cheerful. Lots of smiles in this restaurant.    We ordered the tartars. The beef tartar will not disappoint you. Spicy, salted to perfection and tastes like honey on the taste buds. The Braised beef cheek à la bourguignonne is a pleasant dish. The cook knows how to add texture and sauces to compliment the beef meat. The Lobster ravioli, truffle oil beurre blanc is small size dish but you must appreciate the included ingredients to value the taste. The Grilled veal flank steak, marsala sauce, house fries is beautiful.   I strongly recommend this classy restaurant."}
{"text":"Really solid experience all around.   Great food and good service.   Holden gets the city's top award for salmon tartare.  And it's totally justified."}
{"text":"Beautiful and spacious restaurant with superb food and excellent service.  If you go there for brunch, try their goat cheese and roasted tomato omelet. One of the best I've ever tried.   Will definitely go back again"}
{"text":"I had visited holder for the first time for brunch and I was surprisingly unimpressed. It could be a case of high expectation but I was surprised at how boring the food was.  Im a huge eggs benedict fan so I went for the eggs bene with gravlax. I think they chose the laziest way to make it - english muffin + gravlax + egg + hollandaise . I know sometimes the simple things are perfect but this wasnt the case. There was zero creative flair or interesting ingredients - that aside it was very boring and it felt like something I could have made at home.    The waiters were a bit clumsy - dropping water on the tables as they were refilling and on the phone at some point. The coffee we ordered was also meh , also spilled all underneath its serving plate.   I dont want to judge for dinner - maybe that's where they show their prowess or maybe the eggs bene with gravlax has them uninspired but I wouldn't recommend it and hope they make an effort to change it."}
{"text":"As close to a perfect meal as I've ever had -  My wife and I were in Montreal for vacation and found this place online.  The location was very convenient, situated near our hotel and in the middle of old Montreal just blocks from the basilica.   We went there for dinner, and bolder did not disappoint.  As a matter of fact, every element fell perfectly into place.  We arrived around 700pm Saturday night and were seated at a high top bar table.   The waiter was great.  Friendly, but not too chatty at all. Perfect. I had the braised beef cheek, which must have been some of the best beef I've ever had. She had the canard (duck) con fit. We had fois gras for an appetizer, and chocolate creme brule for desert.  All elements were literally 10/10.  Absolutely perfect.    Well done holder.  You were the best restaurant of the trip, and one of the best I've been to in my life."}
{"text":"Holder has a great air to the restaurant. It's very open and large but still, conceded a douillet feeling.  The menu is expansive and offers a great deal of variety. Our server was very welcoming & accommodating to our needs--my friend has a gluten allergy. The beef cheeks a la bourguignon were excellent and prepared as though I were in a hole-in-the-wall in France. Everything was seasoned in a manner that lent to flavor, without overpowering the foods. Holder's finest quality remains that their food stands alone- no theatrics were implied, just purely & sublimely prepared dishes.  I started with the tartare which was also fresh & clean. The only issue my guests and I came across were the drinks. We ordered several drinks, mostly wine. However, all the cocktails that were ordered seemed to be poorly made. The cosmo had the color and overpowering flavor of cranberry & the sidecar was too bitter-- too much citrus, perhaps. I will order beer and wine the next time I come! I typically order creme brulee when it is available. If you eat here, you must order theirs! The custard was loaded with actual vanilla bean speckles. However, it is hard to choose because all their other desserts blew our entire table away. I will visit again on my next trip to the area."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by a friend, who has never been but it was recommended by her friend. And for a good reason.  We almost walked right past it, because it is very classy and discrete like that. The interior was is very classical and slightly Italian-influenced. Think a good mixture of long tables for families, booths for groups of four and of course the tables of two along the windows. The lighting is very incandescent and warm, which makes everything nice and cozy.  I ordered the duck confit and my company had the steak and fries. The duck confit was the clear winner of the night. They only have a few, selected items on their menu and it's obvious that it's really all they need. Both items are well done. I highly recommend the duck confit. Trust me! We also had the pate and the salmon tartare as appetizers and the vanilla bean creme brulee for dessert. Sound delicious? They were!! I don't remember the exact prices, however it would be considered expensive to most. But I assure you: very high quality and very much worth it.   Service was great. Food took a little longer to come, but it was a busier night with lots of big parties so that was understandable. Servers were friendly but not pushy and constantly hovering. Dress code is business-casual, I would say. Do not wear a suit but do not wear a graphic tee.  It's a very versatile place. It can be intimate and romantic if you so desire or it can be wonderful for a big family gathering. Definitely a place to bring someone you need to impress. Not exactly blow their minds, but it will most certainly leave a nice memory in their mind."}
{"text":"Although poached eggs are on the menu, could not swap poached eggs for soft boiled even for an additional charge. No substations of ANY kind are allowed. The eggs Benedict with house cured salmon came out cold, the baby roasted potatoes were so greasy that when you forked the potato to cut it it oozed out grease, also cold. With so many places to go why bother?"}
{"text":"Lobster ravioli and gnocchi (special) are great treats. They do beef tartar very well here. Great staff and service."}
{"text":"It's in my reliable places to go to when I'm debating where to bring people. Can be loud (the acoustics in this place) and some of the servers can be snotty but food is good! I like sitting out in the bar area and people like to be seen for some reason. Still I'm always happy to go:)"}
{"text":"We ate here on our last night in Montreal.  Food was excellent.  Service was a bit slow but fairly typical for a French restaurant. A good splurge meal."}
{"text":"Good vibes and excellent table service. Our waiter was very attentive. The wine list is extensive and I enjoyed the French rosé. I ordered the lobster ravioli (light dish) and my partner had the hanger steak (heavier) - both great choices."}
{"text":"I like their food and service but i always have problem with their opening hours. We waited 30 min in front waiting for them to open as the front door board clearly says weekend brunch open from 10-15h, yet twice in a roll they ended up not open for the day. It would really be appreciated if the restaurant put up a sign at the front saying closed for the day or at least remove the large board which misled many dedicated customers into waiting in front of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Duck is delicious, helpful staff. Certainly a little pricey but a good value, especially for a neighborhood full of pricey tourist-trap restaurants. Holder is a bit of a splurge but worth the price. Easy to get a seat with a reservation, at least on a weeknight, crowded on weekends."}
{"text":"I would give this restaurant 5 stars for their food quality but there were a few hiccups. The biggest one was they ran out of a few dishes we were planning on ordering. So after going back to the menu to make a different decision my family and I were very very happy with the rest of the meal. I ordered the Lamb Shepard's Pie and it was amazing!!!! I had never had Shepard's Pie so I have nothing to compare it to but from other people who had eaten it they said it was very unique but the best they had ever eaten. The service was very good and all the food came out at the perfect time. Also, I have multiple food allergies and the waiter was very aware and was very clear on what I could and could not eat. In terms of dessert it was quite hard eating dessert at most places since I am allergic to nuts. We ended up not eating dessert here because there we're only 2 desserts I could eat but they all sounded so good. Overall this place was so good and I would definitely go back!!!!"}
{"text":"We had a fantastic experience here on New Year's Eve. We were seated promptly which was impressive for a busy holiday evening. We both ordered specials - shelled lobster over ravioli and filet. Both dishes were beautiful and delicious. We shared profiteroles for dessert. The restaurant is beautiful inside and reminiscent of bistros in Paris. It's a touch noisy on busy evenings but it wasn't bothersome. Can't say enough about our waiter-he answered our questions and provided honest input. It was a wonderful meal!"}
{"text":"In town only for two nights, wearing shorts and tshirts like typical American tourists but were treated just fine by the nice staff at Holders.  Visited about 7pm on a Sunday night.  Full English staff and menu.  Wife got the lobster ravioli ($21).  Portion was on the small side, but tasty.  I got the mussels and frites.  Outstanding!  Some might complain that the frites were a little on the soggy side however, I prefer them that way.  Also got the mozzarela, tomato, arugula and fig salad to split ($11).  Extensive wine and bar, but didn't order adult beverages.  I observed most other patrons either ordered the mussels as well, or got the steak and frites.   This seems to be in the business/banking district and I assume popular at lunch.  I found it far enough from the Old Montreal tourist area to weed out the other Ugly Americans like ourselves  ha ha!  For a quasi-upscale French/Canadian restaurant, this was great without breaking the bank."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and the food was absolutely great! The server was very nice and honest with his suggestions. The main courses were about $20 each. The taste, presentation and first class service were top notch for such a great price."}
{"text":"Best duck I've ever had in my life. It was crispy on the outside and fall-off-the-bone on the inside. We were seated 15 minutes earlier than our reservation and the wait service and atmosphere were top notch!"}
{"text":"I love Holders for the ambiance, the wonderful food - I love the high ceilngs and the feeling of the place.  Favorite time to be there: lunch; or dinner on a quiet evening (as otherwise it can get quite loud)."}
{"text":"Really nice restaurant in old Montreal.  This is a really nice place to take a date.  The wine selection is wonderful.  For me, the beer selection is pretty weak, but that's pretty much what I find all over Montreal, so it's hard to ding the place on that.  Food was great, and I'd go back here any day.  The free wifi was nice too."}
{"text":"Dinner at 6pm after a long day at work. The bar was hopping but not many tables filled in the restaurant. Welcomed immediately by the maitre'd and shown to our table. Effective and unobtrusive services followed. Our meals were great, well prepared, exactly the right portion size, and were well timed.  The place filled up while we were eating.... it was chockablock two hours later when we left. Noisy and happy people, several really large tables. Looks good for families or team celebrations.  An entirely enjoyable evening.  Reservations would be a good idea."}
{"text":"Had dinner here yesterday.  Overall experience was \"mehhh\".  We made reservations and was seated right away.  Decor and ambiance was We drank a lot over the weekend so both my boyfriend and I just had water.  Upon being informed of that, the server seemed to become immediately unimpressed and snobby after (as if you MUST order a drink to be part of the club!).  We had the salmon tartare (too much yogurt/mayo), the fish soup (the best part of the meal), and we both had the duck confit with arugula and fingerling potatoes.  Entree was so-so.  Duck was good, but the arugula was kind of bland.  Couldn't taste any truffle dressing, and there were like, 4 small halves of potatoes to go with it (as if we are in a potato famine).  Overall, for the price and high expectations I had coming in here to eat, I was quite disappointed."}
{"text":"Dinner menu is standard fair.  The lobster ravioli was bad.  If you love ravioli and you want a hint of lobster, go for it.  If you imagine fresh juicy lobster stuff inside ravioli...  skip it.  Their brunch menu is not as robust as La Cartet just down the street but not bad."}
{"text":"Montreal is really an amazing food city. While my stay here was short, virtually every meal that I had here was top notch, and this one was no exception. With two friends, we ordered three entrees and a couple of things to share:  Soupe de poisson (fish soup): this is a creamy fish soup topped with chopped chives, served on the side with rouille (a breadcrumb and garlic based sauce), gruyere cheese, and a crouton. The fish stock is strong, and while the fish was pureed, the texture of the fish is still present in the soup. This was an excellent appetizer, especially as a precursor to my fish entree.  Steak tartare: the (in)famous raw beef dish loved by many. Ours came slightly spicy and garnished with a crouton and sprouts. Really, really delicious. Meat was well seasoned, and the spiciness level was perfect. Would eat an extra full portion of this if I had the time. Highly recommend anyone who haven't had the dish before to give this a try.  Pan fried monkfish: monkfish filet served mashed potatoes, grilled asparagus, and a demi-glace. Presentation was simple but elegant, and and everything paired together very nicely.  Grilled veal strip steak: steak topped with Bearnaise, and served with a mixed mushroom risotto. Again, simple presentation, but rich and delicious. Veal was cooked medium rare and remained moist, with a nice and slightly crispy exterior. Beautifully done.  Duck confit: a classic French dish made using duck legs preserved in duck fat, then served pan fried with fingerling potatoes over a bed of arugula tossed in a white truffle dressing. The dish is flavor overload, as the duck is extremely rich in flavor and virtually immersed in fat. If you like duck and strong flavors, this is the right dish for you.  We were so stuffed we did not have room for dessert. Overall, this was simply a lovely restaurant serving up French classics. Service, by the way, was excellent, and our server was both attentive and humorous, adding to this delightful experience."}
{"text":"Westin recommended this restaurant for lunch so we didn't hesitate to walk a mile from the hotel to try it. We were seated right away and the lady manager cheerfully told us the specials. I definitely enjoyed the duck confit and washed it down with their yummy lemon drop martini. Even the starter bread was fantastic ! Service was great for a bustling lunch hour. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Thursday  night after walking past a lot of the restaurants along the port street.  Holder was much bigger, busier, and had more life that many of the places (and was slightly recommended).  My experience was a little bit mixed.  They are obviously quite busy, so you aren't going to get the most personalized service here.  The food is solid and everyone is running around busy, and the place has a bustle about it.    I had the buffalo mozzarella and tomato salad which was excellent.  The main course, a \"stew\" dish was a little boring, but filling at least.  Our desserts were pretty good.  Nothing over-the-top impressive.  Wasn't blown away or anything, but its a good place to go to be around a lot of people in a big open and modern warm space."}
{"text":"Duck confit, where have you been my whole life!? This place was packed Saturday night but I didn't have to wait since I sat in the bar area. The wait staff was very friendly and they are accommodating to those who are gluten free. I had the duck confit which was every bit of wonderful and my boyfriend had the veal steak with Masala sauce. He wasn't too crazy for the sauce but he said the steak was cooked perfectly and very delicious. It wasn't too expensive either."}
{"text":"Everything about my experience here today, was 5 star.  They serve a great selection of champagne by the glass.  The foie gras starter was sublime, with the right level of sweetness from the pear compote, washed down with a smooth Sauternes.  For my main, I opted for the beef cheek bourgignon, served with perfect smooth mashed potato.  Oh, and I got engaged.  #hesaidyes  Thank you Giuseppe for your help in surprising my man."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch and ordered the duck confit. It could possibly be the best duck confit I have ever had. Nice and crispy, and perfectly cooked.  If I'm back in Montreal, I will definitely be coming back to have this dish again.  The restaurant is very open and has a nice ambiance. Not too loud, and also good for large groups."}
{"text":"Great food, excellent wine selection, and wonderful ambiance.  Our host and server were personable and detailed oriented.  They made sure our food and drinks were satisfactory.   I enjoyed the mussels (enough to share!), while my family had the beef cheeks, paperdelle pasta and hangar steak.  Everything was done to perfection.   I highly recommend Holder Restaurant and Bar, and I would definitely return to this wonderful establishment again in the future."}
{"text":"We went here on the recommendation of our hotel's concierge. Sometimes the concierge and recommended restaurant are running a racket. As to Holder, this place is legit, French bistro the real thing. I had the restaurant's duck, and couldn't believe how crispy the skin was yet how moist and tender the meat was. It came with a salad that was a very able complement to the duck. As others have written, the staff was very attentive. Oh, and I almost forgot... the best part. I had the lemon cream and mascarpone mousse, crumble, and coconut sherbet. All I can say is leave room for it. You might even want to have it before the main course. In the states we'd write OMG, en francais, I think mon dieu is quite appropriate."}
{"text":"This was our first meal on our Montreal \"get a way\" and it was awesome!  I had the beef cheek and it just melted in your mouth.  The service was friendly/attentive and the atmosphere was extremely comfortable.   Will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Disappointing dinner. Pre-circus outing with my 17 year old daughter. Service was excellent, but steak frites and fish and chips were super bland. Fish tasted like the frozen kind baked in the oven. Steak was tough and tasteless. Appetizers - octopus salad and buffalo mozzarella were good. Room is very nice, but ambience is only half the battle."}
{"text":"So disappointed...can't review the food because we didn't stay to eat.  Booked reservations weeks ago so that we could have their French onion soup as it was rated best in Montreal. Unfortunately it's not included during brunch which did not show up on he site when I originally did my research.  We had also tried to move our reservation to an earlier time but unable to do so..the only time offered was even later...however when we arrived almost an hour earlier than our reservation the restaurant was 90% empty.  Note:  Sent a note to the restaurant because they asked for comments...in return got a rude response from the owner...might have tried to re-visit this restaurant but after this response that will never happen.  For what it's worth the French onion soup in Toronto is superior to what I experienced this weekend."}
{"text":"Holder Restaurant is an awesome bistro in Old Montreal. The menus come in either English or French and the server will determine by looking at you which menu to give you :p.  Our waiter was quite knowledgeable about the menu and the wine list but we balked at the expensive Burgundy and went with the Chateau de Cedres instead but the waitress gave us a pretty sour look about that.  Nonetheless, that didn't impact the quality of our food - awesome steak tartare, carpaccio, lobster ravioli and beef cheeks. Great dessert too - I had the Sucre a la creme, which is basically fudge and nuts.   I've heard it can get really noisy. I'd just say it was lively. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"We ate at Holder on New Year's Eve, and really liked it.  There are a few tables near the bar, where they seated us for a drink while we waited for our \"real\" table, but the spot was so good, with a great \"people-watching\" view of the entire room, so we stayed there and had our meal too.  My GF speaks French, but I don't, and the waiter was really accommodating to both of us, despite the fact that he was so busy and the place was packed.  Very stylish crowd and good looking waitstaff... I think both me and my GF had to try to avoid starring at a few of them, ESP after a few glasses of wine.  Ok, now that its established that Holder is a scene, what else did I like?  Well, the food was great, but one goat cheese appetizer was just ok and that's where they lose a star.  Holder is not cheap, but it's way more affordable than some of the more formal French bistros.  Holder is a brasserie, which is basically one big room with a bar, so it's not tiny and intimate like a bistro, but we expected that and liked it.  Definitely a good choice for a nice meal in Montreal."}
{"text":"Awesome brasserie with good value. Would eat here again. Good for a first date or on a romantic weekend to Montreal without being overly soppy.  It's certainly got that 'French' feel to it and the food was very nice too..."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant!! The service was outstanding with servers constantly circulating ensuring the table was clean and our glasses were full. The salmon and oysters were very fresh and the creme brûlée was a huge portion, more than enough to share!"}
{"text":"Every dish at this place was stellar! The duck confit is just phenomenal...so good, great flavor, perfectly salted, crispy skin! Foie gras dish was delightful. Beef cheek Bourgogne was passable, given the odd choice off cut? Moules frites is the best value and the frite is very crisp and dark. Service was also impeccable, fast, and friendly to non-French speakers. Just a great place all around!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. Best salmon tartar in the city and wine selection is wonderful. This is one of my go to restaurants."}
{"text":"Lovely bistro vibe. Great food (lobster ravioli)  and friendly and efficient service."}
{"text":"What a wonderful restaurant! The wait staff was friendly, prompt, and knowledgeable, flawlessly transitioning between French and English for our party. All food was delicious and came out at the same time! Proportions were on the larger side, so sharing was possible on most appetizers and main dishes.   Make a reservation if you can; the dining area and bar were quite full upon arriving. Ambiance is very warm French, attire is on the dressy side.   C'est Magnifique! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The place was great. The waiters were ok but the host took extra steps to check on us. Food was good and is worth the visit."}
{"text":"Sweet serenity! Dessert menu my God...  For the fellow foodies I don't have to even make an introduction with Holder in fine dining. This venue never has failed to please my palatte. I took a different twist this time an tried the dessert menu to share: profiteroles (3 pieces) that had a vanilla ice cream filling painted with chocolate syrup ****; a salted caramel Lava cake with a side of butterscotch icecream*****+ which was simply divine! It had a consistency of a warm muffin topped with melting  butter! I also had a side of mint tea that complimented nicely with my sweet selection.  Each dessert priced around 10$.   Always a pleasure to come back!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went there for breakfast to celebrate his 30th birthday. We were a bit surprised to see the restaurant so empty for 11am on a Saturday. The service was ok, very abrupt and brisk, but still somewhat friendly. The menu at first glance was not particularly appealing... But my husband had the two soft-boiled eggs, truffle tapenade, sauteed oyster mushrooms, roasted fingerling potatoes with garlic and herbs and I had the yogurt with homemade muesli. We ordered orange juice, that came with a hair in it. My cappuccino was also tasteless as was my husband's lattee (we had gone to Le Cartet the weekend before, and had delicious coffee, so were expecting the same level at Holder). My husband's dish was delicious, and mine was just ok. The portions are actually quite small... The waiter also sat a huge group with children next to us, and considering that the restaurant was empty, we did not appreciate the lack of intimacy and respect for our personal space. Overall, the food is good, but the drinks, service and portions are nothing remarkable. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"Wonderful all around. Ambiance, decor service and food. Our party had the duck Confit, beef cheeks and steak dishes. All prepared nicely. Creme brulee and chocolate dessert were delish, although the chocolate was a bit small. Very crowded and recommended by locals. Would say overall nice dinner and would return."}
{"text":"On our first night in Montreal we stumbled across Holder and decided to give it a try .We sat at the bar and had the Spaghetti primavera and the fish and chips , both were served in a timely manner and were very good . We loved the atmosphere and had some of the friendliest and most professional service we have ever had . A nice bonus was the prices were quite reasonable for being such a higher end restaurant and being downtown. We absolutely recommend the Holder restaurant !"}
{"text":"Nice ambience, good (not great) food.  So the biggest caveat is that in its yelp posting, it says \"Good for kids: Yes.\"  I believe that I need to clarify that this is right only if your child is potty trained.  There is no changing table in their bathroom. The hostess was kind enough and told us to use the banquette we were sitting on to change our daughter's poopie diaper.  She was obviously being accomodating, and stated that she let people do that all the time.  I'm not sure how many customers would like to smell poop during dinner, but we had to do it anyway.  So I apologize to all of those who were there the night we ate there.  Another interesting note is that they seated those of us with kids in the back area.  Every single table in our section had a child with them. It seemed odd but somewhat understandable.  That way, the kidless could \"enjoy' their meal without being interrupted, I suppose.  I ordered the braised short rib. It was ok. I probably ordered the \"wrong\" thing because I could have done it better myself at home. However the steak tartare was quite tasty and a good portion size!  My daughter had the salmon which was perfectly cooked and the haricot verts were al dente!  Probably won't be back but it was a good meal, but not outstanding. Thank you to the kind hostess who let us change her in the open... but this may not make your patrons happy."}
{"text":"Le Vieux-Montréal n'est définitivement pas qu'une immense trappe à touriste et le Holder et l'un de ces restaurants qui se démarque. Boiseries, belles verreries l'ambiance est classique mais pas dépassée. Le service est sympathique, efficace et très connaissant du menu et de la carte des vins. Le menu fortement à tendance de cuisine française offre une belle variété de plat et on nous offre aussi des plats à l'ardoise qui changent quotidiennement. La carte des dessert est aussi recherchée que délicieuse. Définitivement une adresse à ajoutée à son carnet."}
{"text":"Holder has great atmosphere and a great menu, fantastic service. Definitely call ahead for reservations, ideally not the same day. We called earlier on a Saturday and the earliest available was 9:30pm.  The salad with parmesan flakes is great. For cold appetizers, highly recommend the gravlax with yellow beets. For a hot appetizer, try the warm goat cheese dish, or the calamari.   The tilapia entree was perfectly cooked and well seasoned.   For dessert, the Bulgarian yogurt with honey and nuts is different but  a good choice of something new."}
{"text":"My wife and I were looking for a brunch place on Sunday. Nothing was open except for Holder and I can see why -- nothing can compete with this place! The service is top notch and the only thing better is the food.   I had the goat cheese and roasted tomato omelet and can't remember the last omelet I ate that even came close to this. This place has set a whole new level on what brunch should be."}
{"text":"Lobster ravioli for dinner. Chocolate mousse for desert. I paid for the richness of my meal the next morning but it was absolutely worth it.   The raviolis were rich.  The lobster filling the perfect amount of filling. The truffle sauce was decadent.  I think there were 7 on my plate. I offered one to my dinner mate and almost regretted it after realizing that was one less I had to enjoy. I soppped up the extra sauce with the bread.  The chocolate mousse was decadent. I could only eat half because it was so rich.   Servers were all super nice.  Gorgeous dining room.  Would definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"We came here for a meal with my grandparents and had a lovely time. The staff were attentive but not bothersome. They kept the water and wine glasses filled so we could enjoy our evening together. We managed to sample a good chunk of the menu between all of us and it was absolutely delightful.   It was an enjoyable evening, with great ambiance, courteous and unobtrusive service, and tasty food--everything I could ask for when taking my grandparents out in Montreal."}
{"text":"Had lunch here yesterday and was really impressed.  Atmosphere: Really warm and welcoming...with slight illusions of grandeur without going nuts. Essentially, my kind of place!  Food: Everything on the menu looked amazing...so I decided to order based on, what I like to call, food window shopping.  Aka...I'll have what that guy's having.  I went with the daily soup to start - a tasty carrot and sweet potato bisque, then had the grilled salmon for main. That salmon was made to perfection...one of the best I'd ever had...the word scrumptious comes to mind.  And the mashed potatoes and the citrusy butter drizzle was delish as well.  Service: We were seated promptly and out waiter was super attentive...he even took the time to explain each special in French and English - which I said wasn't necessary but he said he didn't mind since it would help me (since I can only catch every other word or so). It was a very busy lunch hour but he also took the time to come back and check on us more than I would've expected given the number of people there.  Verdict: Would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Beautiful place for brunch with a French bistro feel, like Balthazar in NYC.  The servers are ethereally beautiful and the breakfast options are congruent with most brunch places.  They serve soft boiled eggs on egg cups which add a novel and nostalgic touch.  I had the Eggs Benny, which were textbook good and my boyfriend had eggs with bacon and he raved about how the bacon was wonderfully smoked.  He also had cafe au lait, which he enjoyed so much that he was contemplating ordering a few more but he had the temerity to stop himself.  All in all, it was a very nice and relaxing place to enjoy yourself and people-watch since there was a high number of very good-looking patrons while I was there."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, friendly staff, hot french canadian chicks littering the joint, and most of all, great food.  I wish I had something funny to say about this place, but I was pretty buzzed.  The foie gras on gingerbread was super good though - which is all I can remember.  Would I eat here again, absolutely."}
{"text":"Restaurant Holder in Montreal (via www.halifood.com)  During my recent birthday weekend, spent in beautiful Montreal, I managed to have a somewhat impromptu celebratory dinner at one of the city's trendier bistros: Holder. Being one of the restaurants that I had stumbled upon during my pre-trip online research, I was excited to physically stumble upon it as well, while taking a snowy stroll through Old Montreal on the Saturday night of our long weekend. The frigid temperature and proximity of Holder to our accommodations, the W Montreal, might have also played a part in our quick decision to jump in and try Holder - that, and the fact that a customer just leaving the restaurant, who eyed us eyeing the menu, excitedly approached us to vouch for the bistro as a must-try. We were sold.  We entered Holder with cautious anticipation, it was eerily quiet on the streets of the city and it wasn't exactly tourist season, even in Montreal - we weren't sure what kind of atmosphere awaited us behind those doors. Once through the entrance, the loud bustle and conversations of an absolutely packed restaurant erupted in our ears. We walked into a full-on, middle-of-a-Saturday-night rush, in downtown Montreal - and there wasn't a seat in the house. Actually, there was ONE left... a high-top for two on the bar side that we happily accepted.   The menu was very French, which was absolutely fine because I had a desire to try salmon tartar for the first time on this trip, and Holder was one of several bistros I noticed had it on their menu in downtown Montreal. My mind was made up on that pretty quickly. To begin the meal, I chose the salad of new potatoes and marinated octopus. (Pardon the photos - all done on my trusty iPhone).  My dinner date started with Holder's take on insalata capresa, throwing in arugula and figs for good measure - a very nice addition. My potato and octopus salad featured a surprisingly nice grainy mustard vinaigrette with lots of tang; enough to balance the rich texture and flavour of the octopus, as well as the starchy potatoes.  The salmon tartar was done with yogurt and Mujjol caviar, and served with a lovely baguette crisp and micro greens. The flavour was decadent and rich, the perfect match for the crisp bread.  I love the texture of raw fish and the essence of salmon, so I also had no troubles eating it straight from my fork with no accompaniment. My date opted for a very French beef cheek bourguignon with mashed potato and mini green beans. Our server had assured him the beef cheeks were actually a Holder specialty, a dish that had been helping them to earn their reputation. I don't think a bite was left on the plate when he was done.  As you know, I'm not easily sold on dessert. To be completely truthful, I couldn't even finish my tartar, however, it was my birthday dinner and so I was talked into splitting something sweet. We ordered the chocolate mousse with coffee ice cream, and were presented with a very cute dish - the perfect size in my opinion. The mousse actually wasn't a mousse at all, and after asking our server about this he explained that there isn't quite a direct translation from english to french for the word mousse. This was more of a ganache, the texture being much more dense than a real mousse, and the flavour very decadent. The house made coffee ice cream was very nice, and the tiny chocolate-covered coffee bean on top an adorable touch. I suppose I was happy after all that we finished off the meal with a little something sweet.  Back out into the frigid streets of Old Montreal, softened by wine consumption, full bellies and the sight of that beautiful drifting white snow against the frozen cobblestone sidewalks.

{"text":"I didn't realize that not having a reservation for 3 people for dinner on Tuesday night might be a mistake - until we arrived at the restaurant to find that it was full. However, as it was still somewhat early, our host was very accommodating, and after about 10 minutes in the bar, we were taken to our table.  Good selection of beers, lots of local options. Reasonably priced wine list with good number of selections too.  We shared a few appetizers which were all very tasty and well presented - endive and watercress salad, chicken liver pâté and beef tartar.  I rarely take salmon at the restaurant, but I went for it based on our waiter's recommendation and it was outstanding, great flavor. My friend had a roasted lamb and veal special, which was delicious as well.  Selection of local cheeses made a great dessert.  Excellent service, prompt, friendly and attentive.  Highly recommended. Also make sure to have reservation, especially in the peak season."}
{"text":"We came for brunch when I saw salmon tartare on the menu, one of Montreal's best dishes that I have a hard time finding outside the city. It was amazing and the little dark caviar pearls made it beautiful. My side salad was perfectly dressed to balance the rich flavors of the tartare. What really pushed brunch over the top were the chef's daily housemade jams: Raspberry lime and white chocolate mango on our visit, which were the perfect palate cleansers for my main dish."}
{"text":"Nous sommes venus un dimanche pour un anniversaire, groupe de 20 personnes, et j'ai trouvé le menu groupe très limité et très décevant (4 choix - oeufs béné, tourtière, quiche et crêpes). Les portions étaient très petites, surtout pour le prix. Le café filtre n'est même pas inclus. J'avais encore faim après mon assiette, même en ayant mangé du pain. Le service n'était pas le plus agréable que j'ai eu. Bref, je n'y retournerai pas.."}
{"text":"Beautiful French restaurant, dark wood, laughter, warm aromas. Our family stopped in last night. My wife had grilled salmon that was surprisingly moist. Eldest son had the hangar steak with sweet creamy caramelized onions. Youngest ate fresh salad and country style vegetable soup. I had duck confit with crispy very salty skin. For dessert we had a scrumptious caramel liquid soufflé and nice profiteroles in a tasty creme Anglaise and a fair raspberry chocolate mousse. Excellent meal."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to Holder, but my first review.  The temp outside was a wonderful 18 degrees as we strolled from our hotel to the restaurant only a block up the street (thank goodness).  The dining room was warm and inviting as we hung our parkas in the coat room.  There is a good variety of banket, center table and bar seating.  There are wonderful copper accents in the room and the lighting is an interesting pattern of iridescent glass and metal.   My choices from the menu were simple and rustic which fit my desire for comfort food due to the cold weather.   I started with a Grey Goose dirty martini, and my normal 3 olives...the olives were not the usual gigantor ones served locally here in NOVA, these were quite petite and as I bit into my first one off the skewer I realized it was not pitted!  I don't mind, but it helps to know ahead...and let's face it spitting those out in your hand isn't too graceful in public.  But the bartender did my drink justice...dry and oh so dirty, and the glass was full...yummm.  My starter was a vegetable soup with a great beefy tomato broth as the base, nice touch of sage in the background, salted and peppered to perfection.  The veggies were rough chopped including scallions, zucchini, chunks of tomato, petite lima beans and julienne mushrooms. The steaming bowl was topped with fresh shaved parmesean.  Main course consisted of beef cheeks (no, not the ones you sit on silly) bourguignon style.  This is classic French cooking...this method slowly simmers the beef in wine which tenderizes cuts of meat that would have been too tough to cook any other way.  The flavor of carrots, garlic and onions came shining through in the wonderful sauce that draped over the mashed potatoes like a velvet sheath.  Simply paired with the beef and mashers were haricovert....green beans folks!  I tried to figure out if the chef had actually used a burgundy, as the rich sauce could have been done with a good cabernet instead.  All in all the meal was everything I wanted that evening and since I'm headed to Montreal on a regular basis I will probably go again.  The nice thing here is that the staff instantly recognizes us Americans and quickly opts out your French menu for one in English....Merci!"}
{"text":"this place was alright. The staff seemed alright for the most part. The food we got was ok. I had an issue with the fish being a bit rubbery, but the rest of the stuff was ok. I would go back again, but it would have to be when its quieter cause we could hardly hear each other over all the people talking so loudly"}
{"text":"The food was tasty, the mimosa was spunky and the price wasn't hefty. That's what I call a winning recipe. I tried the egg benedict and my girlfriend had the tartare. Both were really good (even if I would have taken a fuller plate, there wasn't much there beside the potatoes). Same with the tartar, which came accompanied by one meager bread piece. The tartar itself was pretty big, which is great... If you have something to put it on. Overall great experience, fast service and great pairing."}
{"text":"Très très bon repas! Le servce attetionné et le ratio prix/qualité est excellent! Très belle soirée je le recommande a tous ceux qui aime la cuisine francaise!"}
{"text":"So nice.   5 stars for service....we walked in on the busiest of nights and the host found us a table without a reservation.  5 stars for wait staff......could not have been nicer.  5 stars for wine list.......very good selection of wines by the glass and an excellent martini.  5 stars for food.....bistro fare as good as it gets.  Better confit de canard than France! and the endive salade w/ blue cheese and raisins was amazing.  All in all, a great neighborhood packed happy spot to get a delicious casual, authentic French meal with the kindest service.  :)"}
{"text":"What a disappointment. I have been fond of this place for many years, and I made sure to bring my colleagues here when we arrived in Montreal. It was frustrating from the start. The server said we would have to hurry. She forgot the bread after several reminders. The silverware was taken for no reason. One entree was wrong, another was overcooked. Nothing was done to amend it. I was a little embarrassed. Too bad."}
{"text":"Pour les dîners ou soupers entre amis, l'endroit s'y prête. Mais la hauteur de plafond augmente considérablement le bruit ambiant qui peut devenir désagréable au fil des minutes surtout s'il s'agit d'un rendez vous d'affaire.   Bouffe: 3/5 Sans être très raffinés, les plats demeurent bien cuisinés. Ils sont simples et les portions suffisantes. Encore des haricots verts pas cuits!  Service: 4/5 J'ai beaucoup aimé notre serveuse. Dynamique, souriante, ayant un sens de l'humour un pince sans rire... Bref je l'ai aimée! Les serveurs de fin de soirée ont été tout aussi bon.   Décor / espace: 3/5 Le restaurant possède une ambiance de type brasserie, très convivial mais surtout très bruyant (mais moins que dans mon souvenir!). Nous ne sommes pas trop serrés mais la promiscuité est présente.   Rapport qualité / prix: 3/5 Les prix vaillent la peine pour la cuisine réalisée et la facture ressemble à une facture d'un restau du centre ville. Le choix des vins est intéressant, vins qui sont à des prix pour toutes les bourses.   Au final, un total de 13/20 qui reflète assez notre soirée. Peut-être un peu cher pour une brasserie? Oui.... Mais je l'ai pas dit fort! :).  Cela demeure une valeur sûre selon moi."}
{"text":"Sept 2012 - ducked into this place while walking the street and hungry.  What luck!  Nice restaurant ambiance, we sat at the window and watched people walk by....  FOOD:  Hanger Steak was incredible and it was my friend's choice but I couldn't stop eating her meal.   I had the Lobster ravioli.  It was good but so loaded with butter sauce...it is French after all but I really needed to walk off that butter after that dish!   The endive salad was also flavorful and fresh.  Highly recommend.  No CONS.  Would go back if I visit again."}
{"text":"Opting for a French Brassiere in Old Montreal, Holder was the perfect choice. Both charming and lively.  On a Thursday at lunch Holder caters to a corporate/business clientele and when we went, the restaurant was packed.   The menu is on the pricer side but reasonable in retrospect for the high quality cuisine.   We all enjoyed our meals (French onion soup, beef tartare,  chicken liver, beef cheeks), however, goat cheese appetizer was miniature in size and nothing special."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and first off I'd like to say the service was excellent! The host and waiters were checking up on our table a few times to see if everything was ok. I really appreciated that, considering the place was quite busy. The ambiance was definitely more high end and fancy but hey, food was delicious so the restaurant definitely delivered. I had salmon tartare with caviar and fries, the portion was generous for sure. Gotta love raw food! The fries were really tasty too. It was probably an expensive lunch, but I think it was worth it.   Would recommend reserving for even brunch/lunch because when I got there (which was 11 AM on a Sunday) it was already pretty packed. Will come again one day to try their dinner menu!"}
{"text":"We had a delicious brunch here and would definitely recommend it. My family had some of the more involved dishes, like the soft-boiled eggs with truffle tapenade and mushrooms, which was tasty. I had simple poached eggs, bacon and toast, but they were particularly high-quality eggs and bacon. The space is bright and airy, with large windows, yet still cozy. Service was friendly and professional."}
{"text":"We were a little weary of the front of the restaurant, which seemed a bit stuffy as it is located in the hallway of a corporate building.....we were wrong. The tablecloths were actually white paper not linen and the prices were reasonable. We ordered the mussels which were appropriately sized and were happy to have tried the creamy pastis, plus the beef cheek which FELL apart, it was so tender. The beef cheek was well balanced with sauteed pearl onions and exotic mushrooms. Try the local beer in the red varietal which had a nice spice for the winter months. You could tell locals were the majority, but the menu was english and we felt welcome."}
{"text":"Great restaurant located in downtown Montreal. I came to visit fora work conference and wanted to try French/Canadian cuisine. The hotel recommended this spot and I decided to give it a try.   Decor: Upon walking in the restaurant is spacious and beautiful. There is huge windows to sit by to people watch while eating. We got to see horse carriages walk by which was great!   Food: Superb! The free baguette bread is delicious and French. We had two baskets because it was so delicious. Everything everyone was ordering around us looked delicious. We ordered the chicken liver and warm goat cheese as an appetizer. Great sharing portion and very delicious. For entrees we got the Cajun tilapia which was fresh and seasoned to perfection. The steak frites was cooked well served with grilled onions and fries. My boyfriend are the entire plate!  Service: all the servers and managers were extremely nice and attentive! They had no problem translating the menu and offered great explanations!   If you are visiting I would def recommended this spot!"}
{"text":"Can't wait to go back to Montreal so I can spend another night at Holder.  Love the place.  Was a perfect night with perfect dish after dish.  Especially loved the Salmon tartare with yogourt and Mujjol caviar, great to chase with the Lobster ravioli, beurre blanc and truffle oil."}
{"text":"Nous cherchions un resto ouvert le dimanche pour souper entre copine et nous n'avons pas regretté notre choix.   Très bon repas, très bon service, une soirée plus qu'agréable. Le tartare de boeuf était excellent et la crème brulée exquise. Très bon conseil sur le vin également, j'y retournerais sans hésiter."}
{"text":"We had an excellent dining experience at Holder. We arrived in Montreal that evening and found Holder on our short walk from location on Jun 1.  We were both tired from the flight, happy to be in this lovely city and delighted with the warm evening. We had no reservation and were seated immediately by a friendly host.  The food was excellent !  I had the confit duck on fresh greens with baby finger potatoes with that tasty duck sauce. Over the top! And a glass of wine. My wife had a bowl of soup which loved and some fried calamari. We enjoyed the meal, the service and this great location near McGill & Williams.  We will go back when we visit Montreal again."}
{"text":"Five stars all around!  Food: the beef cheeks were so tender! Highly recommended! The tilapia was extremely well seasoned with amazing flavor. The French Onion Soup was lighter than most, which was great for me; most French Onion Soups in this town are way too salty. The dessert that required a fifteen minute wait was decadent! The ice cream under the cookie was so unique in flavor that I wish I could bring a tub of it back home! The one Rose that they had tasted great, too, but might not have been worth that amount of money; wish the wine glasses were larger!  Service: this place might have the most efficient wait staff in all my adventures in Montreal. My water glass was was always full, there was plenty of bread, and food was ready in more than reasonable time.  Decor: the bar is stocked from ground to ceiling with wine bottles and other alcohol. Everything is placed so high up that the bartender needed a ladder.   Awesome experience! I hope to return!"}
{"text":"We were on McGill street and starving. This place was packed, but the host was very helpful and found us a table. I've passed this place a million times but have never been inside. It was full or tourists so I was a bit worried we'd entered a tourist trap. Fortunately that couldn't be further from the truth. I order the beef cheeks and my friend the lobster ravioli. We both loved our dish. The beef cheeks are the best I've ever had. Ridiculously tender and flavorful. Next time I'm there I will be boring and order the same thing!"}
{"text":"Great food, amazing brunch. My issue there is noise level. Service is very quick, very well located. Easy to find parking on the week-end. They fresh fruits are also very tasty and well chosen (sweet) you won't have the impression of eating fruits that don't have any taste and were picked too early, if you know what I mean..."}
{"text":"Very brisk for Christmas lunch. I strongly recommend reservations. It is very humourous that they would turn us away when the place was empty when we walked in (see picture). But clearly a popular place and by the time we left every table in the place was full.   Without a reservation in busy Christmas lunch season I would recommend a reservation for anything more than 2 people. We sat at the bar.  Expensive lunch: $10 soup Lunch special $19 soup and pasta  Food was ok.... one of my colleagues had to send the lunch special back and the meat was raw. To their their credit they did check shortly after the first bite and were quick to bring a new plate out.  I have great respect for restaurants that have staff that can recognize a problem quickly. I think this was reflected in the tip."}
{"text":"Excellent food!  Started with the goat cheese appetizer. We ordered the salmon, the duck confit, and the lobster ravioli. Everyone at the table was more then satisfied. My wife and friend ordered the creme brûlée for desert and the waiter wouldn't let me off without at least trying the chocolate truffles and a cup of espresso... perfect ending to the meal."}
{"text":"Staff, food, atmosphere are all absolutely top class. We ordered Foie Gras, Tartare (both beef and salmon), pork steak & chips, lobster ravioli, duck and they all tasted amazing and definitely worth the price. A satisfactory experience of fine dining that would perfect your night (or day)."}
{"text":"This was my second experience here.  The first was a Saturday night dinner in March 2012.  I can't remember much detail but it was good enough that we came back to it again a few days ago for brunch.  Canada's 18% tax on food kills me every time but I guess the slightly stronger USD cancels that out.  I say this because the brunch for three people before tip came out to $96 CAD, which seems like a lot for brunch, but we did get two desserts and cappuccinos all around so maybe not.    Price aside, the meal was excellent.  I had the duck confit and it was nice and salty as it should be.  It came with finger potatoes and arugula.  It's nearing lunchtime here and just thinking about it made my mouth water.  The vanilla creme brulee was on point.  The marzapan-type thing was good, too.  The waiters are very attentive and friendly, the place is well-lit and comfortable.  (Also while I was in the bathroom I heard the cooks yell, \"Yes, chef!\" in unison which I took as a good sign that they care deeply about what they serve.)  This place is in Old Montreal, which you know, has a lot of charm.  If you don't mind opening the wallet a little bit, you should eat here while in the area."}
{"text":"This was our introduction to Montreal and it made for a great start.   We had the french toast with caramel rum sauce, which was delicious.  The two eggs, truffle tapenade, etc meal comes with the eggs on a stand with a hole cut in the top.  I've never seen them done that way before but it was fun."}
{"text":"What a pleasant place.  From start to finish everything was spot on and pleasant.  The service was attentive without being over the top, the food was very good and high quality.  Great place for a family meal."}
{"text":"Came here on a last minute reservation and found it about 2/3 full on a weeknight.  So not exactly a hotspot, but I got the feeling it's one of a family of restaurants by the same owner.  The food was good but not inspiring. Service was fine though the waitress was a little hyper.  Okay in a pinch but there are probably better choices for food and atmosphere with a little planning."}
{"text":"Second visit to this place. Had the hanger steak. It was tiny. Like really tiny, maybe 3 oz. smothered onions with an overwhelming taste. Fries we warm-ish and but all broken up into little bits. Like the end of the fryer basket. No vegetables on the plate aside from the onions. Steak was tasty and cooked correctly.  I asked for ketchup for the fries and wait s at lest 10 minutes. Felt a bit like I was in paris where they are reluctant to serve fries with ketchup. My colleague had the special which was a New York strip with mashed potatoes. He said it was good but not worth the price.   Beer was good.   Don't think I'll go back. Many better places around."}
{"text":"Best veal chop and lobster racial we ever had. Not first time at high end restaurants. Sauce on both was amazing with truffles. Veal was very tender. If ever back inMontreal this is our 1st stop"}
{"text":"This is my new fav brunch place in Montreal. Love the atmosphere being classy and elegant. This place is amazing as the service is also on point where they care of you and as it was my first time here, they do recommend the special and I finally decided to go with the Duck Confit Eggs Benedict.   My tea came first and then after a wait of 10-15; my food came and to my surprise, I was fascinated by the colours, flavours and presentation of that plate. The buns were perfectly moist with the eggs Benedict sauce on it as well as accompanied with a strawberry joy with it. I enjoyed it. I was so full and they have an amazing crew as well. All good things at the holder and definitely not my last time here as I'd return for sure!   I'd definitely recommend this restaurant to all if you like an amazing brunch place. It's worth it for the price as the value is what counts and it's great!   - :)"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday for lunch while on a business trip to Montreal. Given that it's in the financial district (Old Montreal), the crowd felt appropriately corporate. The ambiance was lively and the service was prompt and accurate.  I had the Beef Cheek, which was excellent. It was served on a bed of mashed potatoes and haricots. The sauce was a bit too savory, but didn't overpower the meat, which was so tender that I didn't even need to use my knife. Overall, my palate was pleased.  This is a good venue for business meetings and casual meals, but wouldn't be my first pick for a romantic night out."}
{"text":"A lovely lunch with a very nice wine list. We ordered off the quick lunch menu and had a good steak and amazing shrimp ravioli. Very flavorful. Ordered chocolate truffles for dessert and they were so rich, I couldn't finish them."}
{"text":"Came out the snowy cold to the most delicious moule frites (mussels and fries).  The mussels were delicious!  Be sure to ask for some bread to help soak it up.  Mmmm.  The frites were perfectly cooked, but not quite crispy enough.  Maybe cooked a little while ago?  Served with mayonaise, of course.  About $16.  I also had a nice, but small, glass of semillion-chardonay for $6.  I did not leave hungry.  I only wich I had room for creme brulee.  The restaurant is very nice with colorful, subdued lighting.  The bilingual staff was excellent and friendly."}
{"text":"The Yelp Reviews Did Not Disappoint Our  Expectations. As Soon As You Walk In You're Greeted and Immediately Seated. Love The Floor Plan, Atmosphere and Music Playlist. If You Like Red Meat, May I Recommend The Hangar Steak. The Duck Confit Is Another Favorite, The Meat Was So Tender and Delish. For Those Who Love Raw Fish,  The Salmon Tartar Is Another Must Have. Our Server Was Friendly,  Courteous and Outright Professional. Holder Resides Between The Finl District snd Old Montreal."}
{"text":"Food and service were rock-solid the night we were there. Serves a big menu of bistro/brasserie fare. Prices are reasonable for what you get. More importantly, the food is expertly prepared and served.  Located in a huge space with lots of tables so it was a bit on the loud side. But it seems like a great place to meet friends."}
{"text":"Yay! I was definitely a fan! The food was awesome here! I had to arrange dinner for a table of 20 very last minute on a Friday evening and they were able to accommodate me so thank you for doing that. It was two tables but regardless we all got there and we all had great food. I had ordered their French Onion soup to start and yes they are one of the best soup I've had in awhile. The Onion soup was soupy and the cheese all melted in my mouth. For entree, I had ordered their infamous beef cheek and that was delicious as well. At first, I wanted to get the rib eye because I haven't really had beef cheek in a long time and I forgot how tasteful it was. The server told me not to and I really should keep my order and I am glad I did. The beef cheek was cooked just right and as soon as you take a bite, it literally melts in your mouth. To end the night, I had ordered a Creme Brulee and it was pretty big for one person so if you have 2 or three people to share one creme brulee will be fine as well."}
{"text":"Excellent place for breakfast, has a great time even if the restaurant was full full service was great.  I can only recommend, again, breakfast is nice, variety is good and more than enough when you're hungry.  Close to old Montreal, a great walk is a must after!"}
{"text":"I had the veal flank steak here and it is one of the best I've ever had. Got recommended to come here and it was worth it.  Food: 4/5, juicy veal with great sauce. The duck confit was very good as well.  Service: 3.5/5, a little slow but very nice stuff that is attentive  Ambience: 4/5, cool decor and very fun atmosphere for dinner.  Price: 3/5, a little pricy $30/person"}
{"text":"Great food, amazing service. Very accommodating. They mixed up our order but very quickly fixed it and were extremely nice about it. Good champagne selection. Helpful waiters. Would recommend the salmon tartar and the lobster ravioli!"}
{"text":"A great restaurant! I met some friends here last night and we had a wonderful meal. Not very expensive for the quality of food they're serving and totally delicious. Their boeuf bourginon is not actually a bourgignon, but rather a slow cooked beef cheek served with potatoes. That being said, it's still delicious. The service is great although the ambiance is a bit noisy.  Try the hanger steak with the chocolate cream for dessert! mmmm! :) Oh and one more thing, this place needs to get faster at giving th bill and taking payment from customers. THere have been a few times where I've seen other tables just get up and leave without paying since the bill took so long to arrive, or others where the waiters take forever to come with the payment machine."}
{"text":"I eat here pretty much twice a month. The tartare is very good and they have some hidden gems in the wine list. I'm always served by the same waitress, who remembers my preferences in both food and wine. It's my local joint and I always enjoy myself."}
{"text":"Made dinner reservations for 6:30pm on a Saturday and was warmly welcomed by a handsome, energetic fellow upon arrival.  The restaurant was fairly large, but it was rather empty for a Saturday night.  We were seated at a table for two by the window, next to an enormous pot plant that towered over our heads, literally.  I didn't mind it so much because it was on top of my fiancé's head rather than mine, plus it added a special touch to the decor, and him :)  We started off our meals with the foie gras w/ pear chutney and the endive & watercress salad, both of which were pretty tasty and fresh.  Our entrees, the braised beef cheek and duck confit, required a bit of a wait, which was confusing given that not many customers occupied the restaurant, but they were decent, just not WOW.  We both felt that the braised beef cheek, although very tender, was a bit salty and on the saucy side.  The duck was also a tad dry, a big no-no for duck confit.  Service was pretty attentive as our glasses were continuously refilled with water (It was hot out and we chugged them like we were in a desert).  The wait staff was also very friendly, shown through their smiles and cheerful demeanors.  All in all, it was a pretty good dinner but forgettable.  Nonetheless, if I was a Montreal resident, I would probably return for a meal."}
{"text":"My favourite meal during my Montreal stay!  We arrived at noon on Sunday - there were plenty of customers inside but the place is pretty large so we were seated immediately.   We shared 1 croissant, 1 large orange juice, crepes with berries and chocolate sauce, and a tomato/goat cheese omelette with a bagel.  All of it was delicious and tasted fresh. The chocolate sauce was decadent and the goat cheese omelette was perfectly cooked. My only complaint was the \"large\" OJ was small for $6. Also, the omelette came with 3 small potato wedges - wish the mini fruit cup was replaced with more of the tasty potatoes instead!  Service was excellent and efficient. The food came within 10 minutes of ordering. The manager stopped by to ask how our meal was, and as as I exited, the server who had seated me (and who was clearing a table at the time), noticed and wished me goodbye."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE. Food and service was impeccable. We started with the mixed greens & warm octopus salad. Both were delicious. I needed a redemption meal consisting of moules-frites since the one I had in QC was horrible. Holder definitely more than made up for it. The white wine sauce was flavorful and worthy of bread dipping (lucked out with the last portion of the night). My bf ordered the tilapia and it was full of seasoning and accompanied with a delicious side made of veggies with pine nuts.   The staff was very attentive, but in a ninja-like fashion. Voila! All of a sudden you have a full glass of water that was just empty and a clean bowl for the 2nd half of your mussel shells. We were driving for quite some time prior to getting to Montreal and just wanted a good meal so we were in our \"driving clothes\" and sneakers. I don't normally go out to dine anywhere looking like this, but Holder is a classy yet unpretentious establishment so I felt comfortable enough to enjoy my delish meal. I can speak the same for their staff.   We spent about the same, if not more, on a meal during our travels to Canada and it was def worth every cent & all 5 stars."}
{"text":"In Old Montreal right on McGill in an office building.  Large restaurant with a very efficient staff.  Started with Mozzarella di bufala with pesto, tomatoes, arugula, figs, prosciutto, and pine nuts and balsamic vinegar. Great start.  For entrees, we had the grilled hanger steak with shallots and house fries , very good and braised beef cheek à la bourguignonne , great flavors.  For dessert, we had the profiteroles, 3 of them and vanilla crème brûlée, two very good choices.  They have a great wine list.  Truly a very enjoyable evening."}
{"text":"So far, I've been to this restaurant on three occasions: a brunch, a dinner and drinks with girlfriends.   For the brunch: It was a mini class reunion. The staff was very patient with us because some people were very late or never showed up. As for the food, I have to say the hot chocolate was delicious. Definitely not powder-made. The bacon was very thick and crispy. The eggs didn't get cold quickly. We got plenty of refill for coffee or tea. Great meal and at a very decent price!   For the dinner: We were 6 people but we had a reservation. Again, the staff was quite patient with us, because one person was lactose intolerant and it can take a while to get through the menu/asking the chef for no-dairy meals. I had the lobster ravioli with truffle and butter oil. Delicious but very small portion (to be expected). I was still hungry after but I stole some delicious fries from someone else. For dessert: profiteroles and ice cream. Also delicious. I can't comment on the price, because I didn't pay.   Drinks with girlfriends: On Valentine's day, 2 girlfriends and I decided to go to Holder for drinks and appetizers. We had called before to book a reservation and they told us it was not possible. When we got there, they asked us if we had a reservation. Anyway, we made it work and got a table in the bar where we could see all the couples having dinner.   Great selection of drinks at prices that are expensive. Service was efficient. The selection of appetizers was not amazing. My bill was also quite high: for two drinks and a split entrée, it was over $20.   Overall, I would go back to Holder for brunch and dinner, but maybe someplace else for drinks (mostly because of the price). But their wine selection is really good."}
{"text":"This place ranks highly on our list of great dining experiences for my boyfriend and I. We came here on a Sunday evening and were seated immediately next to the window. The restaurant is spacious and beautiful. The server was excellent and he was very helpful. We began our meals with two amazing appetizers. Both the foie gras with gingerbread and beef tar-tare were out of this world GOOD! It was culinary bliss and we haven't even reached our entrees yet. For the main course, we ordered the halibut (not on the menu, but was on the chalkboard) as well as the pappardelle with mushrooms. They were so delicious - it makes my mouth water just describing it.  We also had coffee at the end of our meal and the final tab was surprisingly low for what we thought we were going to pay.  Overall, Holders is a great place to enjoy what Montreal has to offer."}
{"text":"Stopped in for an early dinner the other day. The service was great. Very attentive, engaging, and thoughtful. She was more than willing to help us with directions to places in the area we needed to find. Not sure what the other reviewer who had an early dinner but rated the service poorly experienced but if it depended on the server explaining the dish that's a bit ridiculous as the menu has very good descriptions of the dishes so if he didn't know what he ordered, I'm not really sure what to say.  Our food was delicious. Lobster ravioli and a salmon dish over a potatoes purée. The sauces and entrees were great. Flavors were well balanced and not overdone. Will definitely go back when we are back in town."}
{"text":"My experience here was fantastic from top to bottom. I was thirty minutes late to my reservation because my plane got delayed. They were so kind and accommodating--even stored my suitcase for me while I dined. I was seated right away at a cute window table. Once my water glass was filled the first time, they never let it get empty and brought out breads and butter for me. I started with the warm goat cheese tart. It was the perfect balance of textures and flavors. The pastry was crisp and the goat cheese was creamy and lush and thy were paired with a basil emulsion, olive tapenade, and tomatoes which were a nice bit of acid to break up the richness. Then I had the duck confit which was sinfully delicious. The skin was crisped to absolute, melt in your mouth perfection. Not a single bite was over salted or under seasoned. It was served with a few roasted potatoes and a bed of greens (arugula I think) lightly dressed in something slightly acidic which again balanced the richness perfectly. To top off the meal, I had the butterscotch mi cuit. It was served with butterscotch ice cream and an almond twill. The mi-cuit was perfect with the bit of salt on top to balance the sweetness. The ice cream was delicious, though It may have benefitted from a hint of salt as well. There was a deep  caramel sauce on the plate as well that helped balance the sweetness of the ice cream. Everything was so well balanced and the Service was fantastic!"}
{"text":"I am from the NYC area, so I am used to pretentious, overpriced restaurants where the consistently amazing food is served up by rushed, disgruntled, and generally unfriendly waitstaff. I expected something like this at Holder, simply because it is a fancy restaurant in a cosmopolitan city.  Coming in with that experience, I was absolutely blown away at Holder. I came with a bachelorette party of 12 and was shocked when the waitstaff told us we could easily split up our bills 12 ways. No problem. Such a request could easily get your food served with a healthy dosage of spit in a NYC restaurant. The waitstaff was so friendly. The bus boy came over to fill up our water glasses every 2 or 3 minutes. Our two waiters happily chatted with us, giving us bar recommendations for the rest of the night. Even on a fairly busy Saturday night, we never felt that they were rushed, and more importantly we did not feel rushed.  As for the food, it was not only fantastic, but very reasonably priced. I had the French Onion soup and Buffalo Mozzerella Salad. I wasn't that hungry, and I figured I would be getting an average salad - what can you really do to add to a Buffalo Mozzerella salad? Well, it was easily the best I've ever had. It was served with fantastic balsamic drizzle, really high quality olive oil, arugula, pine nuts and figs. Delicious. The French Onion Soup was crusted with a hearty serving of browned gruyere, just as it should be.  Overall I would highly recommend this place. The prices are fair, the staff is friendly, and the food is great."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. I went several years ago and it was good. I went last night and it was nothing close to the same experience. Our waiter was useless. He wasn't present at all. I asked for rum & coke, he brings me apple juice. Tired of waiting for him I actually get up and walk over to the back for some coke. The food was fair. Nothing special. The owners were nowhere to be seen and it showed. There appeared to be some kind of a manager lurking around. But he clearly was not concerned about the professionalism and efficiency of his staff.   I gave a 2 star review because the first time I went it was 4. But last night was a 1.   Good luck."}
{"text":"One of the best Duck Confit's I've ever had in my life.  There, I stamped it.   The other dish I tried here was the beef cheek, which was really tasty and rich with flavor (and fat).    Service wasn't the greatest as it was a bit pretentious (french speakers got better service) but it was passable.    Expensive food, but awesome flavor.  4 stars."}
{"text":"Legit. Great French cuisine.   Tried the following:  Asparagus soup with crab: so yummy, smooth, and tasty.  Foi gras: the best. Perfectly cooked. sweetness balanced with the buttery liver was delicious.  Duck confit: must try. The duck leg was cooked just right. Crispy. The salad helped balanced the duck.  Beef cheek: good but nothing exceptional. Braised beef over mashed potatoe.  I gave 4/5 due to the beef cheek. Didn't get a chance to try the beef tartar."}
{"text":"Great food, good service, and nice decor. I came with a friend for dinner on a Friday night. We had the salmon tartare and the warm goat cheese as appertizers. The salmon tartare was good, but not the best. The warm goat cheese was amazing! I wouldn't mind eating another plate :P I ordered duck confit as my main course, and my friend got the braised beef cheek à la bourguignonne. We both enjoyed our meals. The duck was cooked to perfection, and serve on a bed of fresh arugula. My friend's plate was very hearty. The beef was well seasoned, and the sauce was so good with bread. For dessert, I got the warm pineapple turnover which was good, but a bit too sweet for my liking. My friend got the butterscotch mi-cuit which was HEAVEN!!    We were both very satisfied with our meals. The price was very reasonable. I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This has to be one of my top fav meals ever.  Started with the french onion soup.  (it's not just called onion soup in Montreal...?)  Wasn't served scalding, which is good, who wants to stare at their food in front of them for 5 minutes so they don't burn themselves?  Traditional serving with a top layer of bread below the cheese...  cheeze wasn't super stringy, broth wasn't overly salty.  Salmon tartar was amazing.  I could eat a bowlful of this.  Could have included more croustini, but bread is included with service anyway.  Lobster ravioli as the main.  So buttery and delicious, I felt guilty eating it.  My stomach was fighting a battle of being full yet still wanting more."}
{"text":"I spent the past weekend in Montreal on a girls' getaway weekend, hoping for only 2 things: good food and good times. Thanks in part to Holder Restaurant Bar, those wishes were granted. We stumbled upon this gem on our search for a Saturday brunch spot that could accommodate our group of 7. The menu was a nice size - a decent selection without being overwhelmed by choices, and the wait-staff was attentive. (I should also note that we had a gluten-free diner in our midst and they were very helpful in meeting her dietary needs and restrictions.) I had one of the omelets, served with choice of croissant, baguette or fresh bread and homemade preserves, a ramekin of fresh fruit and a portion of potato au gratin. The omelet was huge - fluffy and delicious, the fruit was fresh, the homemade preserves were a delight, and the potato au gratin was to die for - potatoey/cheesey/salty goodness... a fabulous way to start any day. All that plus coffee and tip came to under $20. The entire group (that's 7/7) was SO impressed with the quality and value of the food, and we all hope to be back sometime soon."}
{"text":"my buddy and i came here for dinner recently since it was close by to our conference hotel..   we were seated promptly despite not having reservations and it was relatively packed house..   service was prompt and friendly.. my buddy got the duck confit and i got the beef cheek bourguignon.. the execution was spot.. the duck confit was crispy, ducky and beautifully prepared... my beef cheek bourguignon was phenomenal.. really a simple dish.. but the beef was ridiculously tender.. the braise was rich and hearty..   all this was washed down with beer..   if i'm back in montreal.. i'd definitely head back here.. it seems like it was packed with locals"}
{"text":"Everyone at my table absolutely loved their meal at Holder! We started with the amazing warm goat cheese and delicious mussels (an entree that we chose to get as an appetizer). I had the braised beef cheek was very flavorful and so tender. Also, the lamb shepherd's pie was very noteworthy as well--the lamb was pulled not ground which I thought was a wonderful choice. I would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"I have been a few times  I have to say that it's once of the best service in the city  Very attentive staff  I had the oysters , they were succulent !  I also had the salmon tartar which is on the best I ever had. They mix it with yogurt and caviar which makes it heavenly.  I had the steak which was pretty good  My favorite desert is the mi-cuit! Wow!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, a little pricey but amazing."}
{"text":"Nous sommes arrives là par hasard, ne sachant pas vraiment où manger. Un très beau restaurant, la décoration est vraiment chouette avec les bouteilles de vin au mur. Le menu du brunch est alléchant et c'est difficile de choisir. Pour ma part, j'y ai été avec le tartare de saumon. Le goût est là et la portion est généreuse (vraiiiiiment). Par contre, je n'avais qu'un petit crouton de pain qui s'est terminé après 2 bouchés. Je trouvais ça dommage de terminer mon tartare à la fourchette. Le service a été très rapide malgré un groupe sur place. Mon conjoint a pris les bénédictines et c'était très bien aussi. Les patates déjeuner sont grandioses!  À essayer!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch - the eggs benny are to die for (although I'll ask them to go a bit heavier on the hollandaise next time).  Just delish!  My friends ordered the omelettes and frittatas - both delish also.  Can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Good food, great service, and a nice ambiance.  I came here with my dragon boat team and they were very kind to accommodate a party of 30+.  My favourite dish of the day was dessert, Goat cheesecake with mango compote. It's not very often you find goat cheese that is not gamy."}
{"text":"I am very disappointed after reading the other reviews. I ordered the French onion soup and it was very watered down and lacked flavor. We both had the tilapia dish with mussels, shrimp and chorizo. The mussels were mushy and the shrimp lacked were not very fresh. It's pretty inside but that's about it.  There are too many other places nearby that are far better."}
{"text":"Amazing service, wine, and food. I recommend the Duck - probably the best duck I have ever had. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Daniel and I decide to go into the old city because we want something good, french, and tasty.  We planned nothing.  We park, we walked across to a hotel and asked for a recommendation and we got this place.  What  a wonderful little bistro.  Now I'm sure it's not the best place ever, but there was nothing I did not like.  I ordered the creamy vegetable soup and the salmon and holy cow my taste buds were happy.  Daniel order the gravlax (oy so Jewish) and the veggie couscous with anise sauce and he was doing a little dance at the table.  He had a very nice red wine and I had probably the best Tanqueray and Tonic ever.  For desert I nearly died - I had this mouse-like ganache cake thing that was so rich!  Daniel and the creme de la sucre - sugar creamed with maple I think - whatever it was so good, and came with a side of nuts that he loved - we had to order another to take home with us.  The bar are is huge and the service was wonderful.  They even knew how to speak English so I didn't seem like a total jackass.  I would so go back here."}
{"text":"Solid as I recall it to be. Both my fiance and I had the hangar steaks with shallots on sat evening. Simply Devine.  I could not ask more of a hangar steak. Service was professional, respectful and very knowledgeable. Highly recommend to any in search of a classic french bistro in montreal!"}
{"text":"The location/ambiance: It's located somewhat between the financial district and the old port, so if you're there for sightseeing or business it's a decent choice for a nice meal out. The place is classy (lots of warm tones - brown, copper) without being too pretentious. It's not too cramped, but we were there on a Monday night so the crowd was sparse anyhow.  The food: I enjoyed the food for the most part, some dishes definitely were better than others and there were a few disappointments along the way. The warm potato salad with marinated octopus was out of this world. It was bursting with flavor and was more octopus than potato salad in the end. The goat cheese starter was also very nice, though quite rich. For entrees, we had the lobster ravioli and the fish & chips. The ravioli was fine, but nothing special. I didn't care for the presentation or the mass of onions in the dish. The fish was nicely done and melted in your mouth. Dessert was a brownie with chocolate ice cream and some sort of raspberry sauce. This was the worst part of the meal and it really lacked a deep chocolate flavor.   The service: This is where the whole experiences goes a bit awry. We're seated promptly by a stiff maitre d' and then wait for 20 minutes for anyone to come take a drink order or tell us about the specials. Finally the maitre d' comes over and says something off-putting like, \"Looks like you're anxious to order\" and takes our orders without telling us the specials. The food comes promptly and was true to the menu. We receive no other service until halfway through our entrees I finally flag down a waiter to order another drink. Apparently, he was our waiter but this was the first time he spoke to us, as he was busy flirting with other patrons. One of the drinks was delayed until our entrees were nearly completed. For dessert, he reeled off a long list instead of giving us a menu. Only during dessert were we ever asked how the food was. The waiter was jovial but he was not good at his job service wise.    This is hard to rate because the food was overall very good but the rest of the experience I would never want to re-live.  Average."}
{"text":"On our first night in Montreal, we opted to try Holder.  We were a little bit worried at first because we had a vegetarian with us.  Since we don't usually worry about what's on the menu, I had to ask if they had any options for vegetarians.  Luckily, they did!  We tried the duck confit and the fish.  Duck confit was cooked perfectly.  Fish was tender and flaky.  Service was friendly and attentive.  They kept our water and wine glasses filled.  Would def come back to try brunch next time!"}
{"text":"It's a solid space in the old quarter of Montreal. Spot on with customer service. Whether you speak english or french.  It's truly a modern, but yet old world French feel. It has a typical look I've seen in many french themed restaurants.   We came here for brunch. I ordered a quiche made of spinach, gruyere and mushroom which came with a side salad. It was delicious and I craved more. Always a good sign when you want more.  Would I go here again? Maybe.  It's not that the food wasn't good or the space wasn't clean or modern. IT just lacked a joie de vie.  It felt a little sterile at times but it doesn't mean the space isn't welcoming. I certainly recommend it."}
{"text":"Fantastic ambiance and what I thought was some great, professional staff. However- food took a while to come out, and when it did, my order wasn't right. Rather than wait another hour for a correction, I was forced steal more bites of my boyfriend's picks. The duck confit was tasty!"}
{"text":"Everyone enjoyed their meal more than I did, so this place is probably a 4/5...just not for me.  I came here specifically for duck confit and was gravely disappointed. I asked for it \"extra crispy\" (because I love tender duck meat covered in thin, crispy skin) but it wasn't crispy at all and, in fact, the underside of the skin was mostly unrendered fat. No thanks.  Having said that, everyone else enjoyed their food thoroughly:  Fois gras pate....wonderful Mussels....exceptional Fish and chips....\"the best I've ever had\" said Mitch Braised beef cheeks....truly excellent  I guess I just ordered wrong.  The large space is a nice, well-designed bistro but for me, lacked a bit of warmth and personality. Next time I would go around the corner to Barocco."}
{"text":"Excellent service! La nourriture me séduit chaque fois, je ne sais jamais quoi choisir tellement je veux tout! Délicieux, belle ambiance, toujours mon 1er choix!  À essayer:  Tartare saumon et tartare boeuf Joue de boeuf Pappardelles Tartelette de chèvre chaud Salade de pieuvre et grelots Huîtres 6 ou 12 Calmars Potage paysan Velouté d'asperges, crabe et jambon Canard confit Onglet de boeuf  Saumon grillé Tilapia Mi-cuit caramel fleur de sel Crème brûlée  Il y a toujours les midis de semaine 3 choix de menus du jour accompagnés d'une salade ou potage du jour ainsi qu'un choix de viande et de poisson du jour. Tous les soirs il y a aussi un choix de viande et poisson du jour."}
{"text":"I'm going to confess that I'm writing this review a bit late so I might be a bit hazy on my food. The atmosphere of Holder is incredibly classy but since it's located in the heart of downtown Montreal I expect nothing less. The first time I came in here it was spectacular, dragged in here by my friend's mother urging us to try the fried ravioli, a mixture of cheese blended with a bit of jalapeños. I am a huge jalapeno poppers fan so I couldn't stop reaching for more, despite the heaviness of the starter.   After, I decided to drag my friend back there so that we could get a better sense of the restaurant. We ordered my usual drink, a Jameson and ginger ale, then proceeded with the meal. At one point the waiter disappeared but for 9:00 pm at night it was relatively packed. I was craving seafood so I ordered a pan-seared tilapia in my pidgin French which came out relatively nicely. I'm not a big fan of tilapia as I often think it's a very cheap fish but this one was dressed nicely for the occasion. It was served on a bed of julienned carrots and other greens topped with almonds (I think, again forgive me my memory is hazy). Not bad, but not knock you off your feet amazing.   Overall, not a terrible dining experience, our waiter was a bit lack luster but hey he didn't ruin the meal. However this place is incredibly pricey and for the price I paid I expected much better quality food. But hey, you're on vacation splurge a little. It was a decent choice for the price but with no regrets now I leave the decision making up to you."}
{"text":"Came here to grab dinner on a Saturday night  Atmosphere: - French bistro trendy - Got a nice table by the street, indoors  Service:  - Lacking - waiter was inattentive and not friendly.  I'd say he was your typical Quebecois waiter - Specials were not offered up, had to ask him if there were any  Food: - For an app we got the Gravlax and yellow beet carpaccio, orange and dill vinaigrette.  This was ok. Nothing special - Lady got the Pappardelle with mushrooms, pine nuts and pancetta.  This was in a cream sauce.  It was not very good. It was not that warm (had been sitting in the kitchen too long) and it was more cream/oily that one would want - I got the Braised beef cheek which was edible and served over mashed potatoes and hericot vert.  The dish was not very warm (had been sitting in the kitchen too long), the wine they used to braise the meat was cheap and you could taste it in the sauce.  Overall, I wasn't that excited about this - We passed on desert  Other: - Prices are too high for the quality  - Didn't like the vibe of the place - Overall wish we didn't waste a night out here"}
{"text":"A perfect brasserie!  Full and active on a rainy Sunday night. It's easy to walk past the entrance from the street.  You hang your coats and umbrellas the the cloakroom. The room is enormous yet so bustling it seems warm and inviting, but not too loud.   Around the columns are chalkboard menu specials  Chicken liver pate and beef tartare were excellent. The pate was served in a deep cup along with toasted bread.  One entree was calf's liver served with a generous helping of richly decadent mashed potatoes and a heap of caramelized onions.  The other was a Shepard's pie: perfect shredded lamb over superb mashed potatoes.    We ended with an Armagnac - a nice way to top off such a heavy meal. Holder offers a very good selection of reasonably priced digestives.  Service was excellent - the wine list offered a very good range of choices.  The menu offers may good choices. Bring a hearty appetite."}
{"text":"Had an amazing brunch this morning. My dish was very tasty and the bacon was nice and crispy, but not dry.  Now it's time to go and have a productive day. Service is very quick, very well located. Easy to find parking on the week-end or early morning."}
{"text":"Went for dinner on Fri night. I love that their kitchen is open late . Nice restaurant that you wanna dress up a little bit for. The salmon tartare as an app was very good.  The lobster ravioli was perfect... the most perfect ravioli I've ever eaten. BF had the shepherd's pie which was delicious! The food  presentation was aesthetically pleasing.  Topped it off with profiteroles for dessert. Our waiter was very nice and attentive helping us choose items on the menu. When we left the staff behind the bar wished us a good night. Def reccommend this place open late, great ambiance and decor, friendly service and most importantly great food."}
{"text":"Great food, nice restaurant  This is a place on our must-return list.  The restaurant is nice, not especially elegant, more like a bistro.  The service is quite good and the food is scrumptious.  the bavette de veau (veal) a la marsala had the best sauce on it since I first enjoyed it over 30 years ago at a small Montreal location.  Better than any I've had at many US restaurants in the intervening years.  My family reports that the duck confit was also excellent.  The desserts were beautifully presented and delicious, but I can't quite remember what we had."}
{"text":"I'm really not sure what I think of this place. On one hand, it's got nice decor, the food is reasonably good, and the service is fine. On the other hand, it feels a bit artificial, and for the prices, I'd expect a better experience.  On the food, it is supposed to be a french bistro and the food sort of reflects that. I had a salmon tartare, which was very good. But, the menu was littered with other options like fish and chips and pasta primavera. To me, that's a dead giveaway of a place that is going for a theme but wants to stay mainstreamed and broad. I think the other dishes people had, including the lamb and the fish and chips (I recognize the irony) were all fine. The desserts were obnoxiously large and were generally odd, gaudy takes on French dessert.  The service was fine. Nothing bad, nothing especially good. It was fine; I have almost no reaction at all.  The interior is both nice and revealing of the restaurant's underbelly. It has all the trappings of a classic French bistro, done in a modern, large space. But, the consequence is a feeling of almost corporate design. It's consistent with the menu, I think."}
{"text":"Appetizer and dinner were outstanding.  I had the cold Foie Gras, which was perfectly paired with a pear chutney and a wine that was recommended by my waiter (do not recall what hte wine was).  Then had the lobster ravioli with truffle cream sauce, fantastic.  Dessert was creme brulee which was pretty standard, nothing too exciting.  took a star off to the not-exceptional dessert and service at times was a bit lacking, but the waiter was quite busy."}
{"text":"Holder is a wonderful place with simply delicious food and great service. The space is a bit loud, but not unbearably so. The decor is a nice blend of old world style and sharp modern lines.  In giving the place five stars, I must admit that I had recently eaten meals featuring duck hearts, sea snails, and bone marrow, so I was ready for a hearty, more classic bistro meal.  First, I ordered the Country Seasonal Vegetable soup (around 8$). It was the best vegetable soup I have ever eaten at a restaurant- perfectly balanced flavour that was not too salty, spicy, or bland.  For my main course I had the steak and frites (around 21$). The steak was perfectly cooked and flavourful. The frites were blessedly not overcooked or oversalted.  Dessert featured several options. I chose a butterscotch dessert (around 9$) that had ice cream and an individually cooked cream filled butterscotch cake. It was pure deliciousness.  The service here was great. Food came in a timely manner, and my group never waited for water refills or plates to be cleared.   I would return to eat at Holder's tomorrow. It is great particularly for those looking for a straightforward French bistro meal."}
{"text":"This was hands down the BEST meal that my boyfriend and I have ever shared together. The ambiance is awesome and the staff could not be more gracious. We got there on a Wednesday night and the place was packed (always a good sign). When the host asked if we had a reservation, we said no. Then, we waited for that face that most snobby hosts/hostesses make (you know the face...) when they tell you that there is nothing they can do. To the contrary - the host smiled and asked us to step to the side - assuring us that he would find us a table. Within 3 minutes, we were seated. Our waiter (I believe his name is Martin?) was so kind and provided top notch service. Everything we ate was perfect - it melted on our mouths! I had the salmon tartare, lobster ravioli and the chocolate mousse. My boyfriend had the foie gras (cold), hanger steak and the Creme brûlée. If we lived here in Montreal, we would definitely come here on a regular basis. It was definitely the highlight of our trip!"}
{"text":"You see that cover photo they have of steak tar tar?? That's my pic! Yay!   Love this place!!! The atmosphere is very French bistro. The service was excellent- they are there for you but not over bearing.  The food was fantastic. I had the steak tar tar (smaller portion) which was actually plenty. The steak was very fresh and the flavors all blendes together nicely. Came with toast as well. Pretty filling if you are not too hungry.  Then I had the beef cheeks. Braised. Over mashed potatoes. With a dark beautiful sauce. I really enjoyed my meal here and the prices were very fair.   There were also alot of locals here which is always a good feeling. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Such a shame Yelp does not have Canadian presence yet... I'm sure the locals have lots to say about this gem amidst their city.  Knock. My. Socks. Off.  That is what Holders did to me.  I started with a roast vegetable gazpacho topped with goat cheese- heaven!  (Although my sister found it too similar to salsa)  Next up was lobster ravioli with a truffle oil sauce while my sister had her usual steak-frites.  A bottle of Brouilly and we walked out the door with a bill under $100!    How fantastic to be able to eat in such luxury without paying too much money!"}
{"text":"Beau restaurant situé au centre - ville. L'intérieur est convial . Le service était rapide et efficace et la nourriture tant qu'à elle était savoureuse ."}
{"text":"I enjoyed Holder during my recent trip to Montreal because a local colleague of mine recommended it. I found a very beautiful and spacious restaurant with friendly service, and a very upscale trendy atmosphere that is perfect for a romantic dinner or work event. The bar area also is large to accompany large groups.  The menu is traditional French with many variations. My colleague loved the salmon, and I chose the traditional hanger steak and frites. The fries were delicious, and the steak was A-Ok (not the best I've ever had honestly but good). The complimentary fresh French bread and butter was a wonderful way to start the meal. I chose coffee to end my meal, and it also was dark and tasty.  It's hard to compete in a city of so many great French restaurants, but this is certainly one that stands on its own two feet as a nice place to experience the city's cuisine if you're in the area."}
{"text":"We went for brunch and ordered the omelette of the day and the salmon tartare. The omelette (featured duck, mozzarella cheese, and mushrooms) was so-so but the salmon tartare was very good. I'd recommend that one."}
{"text":"i love this place. in the last few montreal visits, i've made an effort to return to this restaurant for a great dinner. staff are very polite, food is on-time, delicious and the menu changes. the restaurant facility is very cool, in old montreal with lots to do and see afterwards."}
{"text":"Best duck confit! Crispy outside and tender inside. Falls off the bone. Fingerling potatoes and arugula perfecto!!"}
{"text":"A very pretty room in a cool looking building. Crowded but not noisy. Recommended by a local. We were not especially impressed. Everything was fine but nothing was very good. It was average food. We had hangar steaks and mussels and they were okay but I can do better myself with them any home. The broth was more salty than anything else and was missing that something that makes you want to drink it. Then broccoli rabe was bitter. Steaks were cooked correctly, frites were good, the service was very, very good. Our server was friendly, attentive, and professional. The place seems to be very popular but we did not love it."}
{"text":"Nothing impressive, it's nothing more than average. Their brunch had really small serving sizes and pushy service. Everything tastes just fine, I can't believe i was really looking forward to dine here"}
{"text":"Me and my brother-in-law went there for occasional lunch not very busy early afternoon after we received our food and we're eating and in a conversation the busboy tried to reached across our food and our conversation to grab the sugar he asked my brother-in-law to stop eating and grabbing a sugar for him that was very rude and very unacceptable I've been here a few times I feel like the waiter is on methamphetamine. Don't know if this restaurant has a drug problem I'm leaning towards that."}
{"text":"Eaten a few times this year. Really enjoyed the liver. Good price ($25 - $35 pp) quick service and big variety. Enjoyed the scallops when they were the special of the day."}
{"text":"A nicer and somewhat larger place for French style fare without being too expensive. The decor is attractive and the space is large but not very noisy. Service is professional but friendly. The shrimp special was delicious as was the vege soup du jour. We also tried the octopus appetizer and the duck confit. It is on the edge of the old city so not touristy and well worth the walk."}
{"text":"Tres bien! Very enjoyable service and meal."}
{"text":"Had their Confit de canard, pommes de terre rattes roquette, vinaigrette truffée. Price is ok.  However, the duck very oily so the bed of arugula was completely soaked in oil. I think they could've patted off some of the oil before serving.   Ambiance is a bit noisy at night so it's great for groups maybe not if you're trying to have an intimate dinner."}
{"text":"Holder was picked after about an hour of reading reviews and looking up menus. The atmosphere was warm and inviting. We came on a Sunday night and it was slow. Our waiter was very friendly, and very handsome! We started off with the warm goat cheese appetizer, DELISH! I ordered the duck confit which came with an arugula salad and roasted potatoes. The duck was perfectly cooked and not too salty as duck confit often can be. I was slightly disappointed with the very small amount of potatoes, I think there were 3 half small potatoes on my plate. My friend ordered the lobster ravioli and enjoyed it.  With splitting the appetizer between the two checks and a glass of wine, my check ended up being about $40 before tip."}
{"text":"Had a tasty brunch here recently: recommend the poached eggs and truffles and also crepes and maple syrup dish. Le service est correct."}
{"text":"Walked in late on a Sunday night about a half an hour before they were closing and they seated us immediately and were not put off by the time at all which was really nice!  My bf and I both ordered beers that came out almost quicker than I thought was possible for our adorable waitress to go get.   My bf ordered the foie gras appetizer which was amazing and I had the french onion soup which was really good but not the best ever.  We split the duck confit as our entre.  It was AMAZING, perfectly cooked and extremely delicious.  I'd go back just for this dish.  We stayed past closing and they were still seating.  It was really nice to see that they didn't turn anyone away.  Loved this place.  Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Great Food, great ambience, warm staff. Anything in the menu except the liver is bomb. Ive had the duck which was incredibly succulent, hanger steak is a bit small but makes up in quality. Creme brulee is simply phenomenal"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner! Had the salmon tartar which was really good, and we ordered the lobster ravioli and the braised beef cheek. Both were great, although the ravioli isn't filling. Make sure to get a reservation since the place was absolutely filled, and its location is a little walk away from old port. Definitely wanna come back for brunch!"}
{"text":"Six of us came here for a dinner and it was pretty lively and a good dinner crowd for a Monday evening. The restaurant is on the western edge of old Montreal on McGill just  1/2 block north of St Paul Oest street. It is inside a large stone-faced building in suite 100.   It is like a downtown restaurant in many cities, filled with some businessmen in suits, but on this evening there was a lot of tables full of 30 somethings enjoying group dinners. Our server was a smiling and efficient woman who made our meal well paced with wine (decent selection but not stuffy in range), appetizers (about $10), mains (averaging about $20 - $25) and desserts (roughly $8 average).   For appetizer I had a chilled salmon gravelax, very good! Others had the fisherman's soup, small salads, salmon tartar, beef tartar and gazpacho. For mains we had Hangar Steaks with Frites, special Halibut in a cream sauce topped with veggies, and I had the Duck Confit on a bed of greens with country potatoes. We enjoyed a couple of bottles of Ortas 2009 Rasteau Rhone. Desserts included a lemon mascarponi, creme brûlée, and a chocolate cremieux with coffee ice cream and sauce.   Everyone enjoyed their dinner at our table, and it seems everyone else in the restaurant were smiling and enjoying good food, wine and friends."}
{"text":"We came here for Saturday and Sunday brunch! The food was great, really liked eggs Benedict with salmon! The omelet was great as well! Service was fast and the host was very welcoming! Overall very good experience!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch on a Sunday and they only had a brunch menu with some options for lunch. It's good in general given the prices. It's big and calm so easy to find places."}
{"text":"My friends and I came here late night about 9pm just for apps and desserts. We weren't hungry, but thought we should have something. We ordered the beef tartare and fried calamari. The tartare was typical, but there was some gaminess to it that came back to haunt me in the middle of the night. It was served with crostini, but I liked it better with baguette  which you need to request. I also spread a little butter on each bite to give it more richness and stave off the gaminess. My friends liked the calamari which was lightly-battered and perfectly cooked. Portion was small for the price. These are rings from large squids not the tiny ones, so no legs if you're into that like me . Desserts were priced reasonably and tasted amazing. One friend had the vanilla Creme Brûlée, I convinced another to have the Profiteroles (small puffs filled with vanilla ice cream in a pool of chocolate sauce), and I had the Butterscotch Mi-Cuit which was a butterscotch soufflé served with butterscotch ice cream and caramel with an almond cookie. We would return just for the desserts."}
{"text":"I came to Holder with a group of 10 for a late lunch one afternoon, per the suggestion of my hotel.   I ordered the Lobster Ravioli ($24) and my friends ordered the Duck, the Lamb Shepard Pie, the Tilapia, the Fish and Chips, and Steak. I enjoyed the lobster ravioli but it was not the most filling of the meals for its high price tag. My friend however said that the Duck was really good.   The prices were higher than other restaurants in the area and the waitress blatantly stared over our shoulder as we left the tip on the handheld payment machine.   Overall, Holder was a decent restaurant for lunch with higher than deserved prices."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant last night, the second time in a year.  I must say this is an absolutely delightful restaurant. It is a fancy place, but where you won't feel burdened by form or rigidity.  Both times I have come I have absolutely enjoyed their beef tartar. It is quite outstanding actually. I suggest you get it very spicy! It goes just perfectly with the crisp bread crackers they bring!  They also serve delicious oysters and have a nice selection of both appetizers as well as main courses.   Last year I had their flank steak, which was very good, but this year I opted for one of the night's specials, a ribeye steak with truffle and rustic potato mash.  Absolutely delicious! The people I was with had a delicious looking dessert, however I settled for a glass of Chivas Regal!  Try the beef tartar spicy!"}
{"text":"We are sitting here for almost 2 hours with no food!  i guess something is amiss in the kitchen.  I would not recommend this restaurant currently.  good luck!"}
{"text":"Had a lovely meal here!   Seemed slightly better priced compared to other similar brunches in the area. Very friendly service who refilled my water glass 1 million times (it was a warm day). Quiet at the time we went, on a Sunday afternoon - a very relaxing environment.   We ordered two savory dishes - a spinach salad with smoked salmon on it, and fish & chips, plus fruity crepes. The salad was so good and filling (surprising, for a salad) that I barely got to the rest, but suffice to say that everything was tasty.   I also had the cheapest wine on the menu, a pinot grigio, and it was really delicious!"}
{"text":"Recommended by the concierge at the Marriott Chateau (which is lovely, and 4 stars).   Holders was lovely, warm and inviting. Staff was as well. Friend and I stopped for lunch, and were lucky to get there just before the lunch rush. Service was prompt, courteous and efficient without being overbearing. Menu was interesting and very varied.   My friend had the Braised beef cheek, which he liked very much, and I had the seafood soup and the warm octopus and new potato salad. Octopus is a favorite of mine, but you take your chances, as it can be very rubbery if cooked poorly. Luckily, the chef at Holders knew EXACTLY how to cook it, and it was wonderful. The contrast of the octopus and the potatoes, highlighted by the sauce was delectable.   Will definitely go again when in Montreal."}
{"text":"Came here at the recommendation of my hotel and was very very pleased. Great soup and one of the best duck confit dishes I've had."}
{"text":"As Lisa N points out, the Foie Gras with gingerbread was executed well.  Unfortunately, any sous chef should be able to execute this dish and the pairing is practically a standard.    The warm potato and octopus salad was meh.  Tender octopus was muted by an ocean of mustard sauce.  The meal went downhill from there.  For main courses we ordered the Lobster ravioli and the Roasted Scallops.  The ravioli were edible though they tasted as though they were purchased from a distributor rather than made fresh.  The scallops were a complete disaster.  Listed on the menu as \" Roasted scallops, saffron sauce, leek \"confits\", spinach\" they were served wrapped in bacon.  While that's not a crime in and of itself, it is problematic when patrons may not eat pork products and that is not listed on the menu.  We're not helpless or zealots - so we cut the bacon off and began to eat but the scallops were cooked past well done and rubbery.  We left the plate practically untouched.  For dessert we ordered the fruit salad with sherbert and the runny butterscotch cake in order to hedge our bets and I'm glad we did.  The cake was fine if not good but the fruit salad was a disgrace to chefs everywhere.  A plate of day old cut fruit replete with the juice that had leaked out of them as they died a slow death.  The plating was that of a school cafeteria - slopped on the plate.  If one eats with their eyes first, my eyes were disgusted.  I would not recommend this place, nor trust the opinions of those who do."}
{"text":"Really loved this restaurant, as the perfect french bistro. We had a french onion soup, and seared foie gras, gingerbread, red wine reduction, and dried fruit for appetizers. For entrees, we did the salmon tartare (as a main), and the lamb shepherd's pie. All dishes were delicious, with the foie gras and the salmon tartare outstanding. The restaurant was roomy and had a lively vibe. Would definitely come again."}
{"text":"Fun bistro with great food.   Great service. The place is dim without being overly dark, casual but festive.   The menu had so many delicious looking choices that if we lived in Montreal we would have to come back to try more! Here's the run down of what we ordered:  Buffala mozzarella salad: YES. A wonderful twist on a caprese. The arugula is in the most wonderful balsamic, the cheese is soft and salty, the proscuitto is prosciutto.   Vegetable soup: spectacular. Similar to minestrone and just fantastically flavored.  Salmon tartare: really good. The yogurt is a nice compliment. It's a lot so I would recommend getting the appetizer portion.  Salmon: didn't try but my mother really enjoyed   Warm goat cheese: good, but the only thing that didn't amaze us. Pretty simple goat cheese without too much flavor. Would skip this next time.   Hope you enjoy this as much as we did!"}
{"text":"Very solid food, great lively atmosphere and elegant decor... the hotel told us it's an excellent representative of French cooking - as advertised!"}
{"text":"Portions are big, but overall the food is uninspired. It's decent, but not for the discerning.  Also the noise level is very high. Totally uninspired wine selection by the sommelier, it was clearly a choice that was intended to be easily drinkable rather than a nuanced bottle."}
{"text":"This place is outstanding. The foie gras on gingerbread was phenomenal, the atmosphere delightful. I must also say that the service was what really makes this place special. We were a large group and they really did a fantastic job - getting our table organized before we arrived (we called ahead), being patient during the ordering process as everyone consulted over wines and appetizers, food coming out all together and being delivered to the correct person with confidence, and automatically splitting everyone's bill (remembering who split wine with whom, etc). I was hugely impressed."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here, was delighted by the food although the portions were really small. We were a rather large group and our waiter seemed somewhat annoyed and impatient. He could've handled that better, instead, service was slow and unthorough."}
{"text":"Great place! Big place with lots of tables and a French brasserie aesthetic. Everyone's food was delicious and the service was excellent. Delicious goat cheese appetizer, salmon with lemon-beurre blanc potato puree (I could have eaten 10 potatoes' worth of that stuff!), and desserts. The food was even on par with food we ate on our last visit to Paris, which I don't say lightly! A little loud and crowded on a Saturday night, but this was the only place in the area that had room for 4 last-minute--we appreciated that they were willing to accommodate us! Would highly recommend this place for a nice dinner out."}
{"text":"This place looks very nice. But far from cozy and ambient atmosphere... more like a place you take your sorority party to eat and drunk.  Loud. My grilled tilapia was nothing but salt. Placed on top of rice which I hardly tasted underneath all the spices.  Thank god the service is great, so water was refilled at all times!  Would I come back??? I didn't hate the place, but unlikely."}
{"text":"The decor and ambiance of the restaurant was lovely. The place felt nice and cozy. But we were not impressed with the service. We came here at 5pm on a Monday after seeing all the great reviews. But our experience was not acceptable for a restaurant of this caliber.   Service was horrible. When we first arrived, there was no hostess or anyone available to seat us. There was coat check but no one offered to take our coats. Once seated we did not get any water until we called the hostess to call the server over for us to order. The server was never around to provide us any service. We asked a few questions regarding the menu but the server wasn't really informative or helpful.   When the food arrived they just place it on the table with out explaining the dish. I'm not sure if that was normal but all the restaurants I go to in this range usually explain the dish and what's inside.   The server also never excused himself when he reach over us or come by with utensils and plates. I felt that this was really impolite. Even when he was clearing the table, he held the plates with a bunch of knives right in front of my boyfriends face at eye level.   As for pay. The bill was tossed on the table. The credit card machine was firmly left on the table too even though the server knew that we were ready to pay. The server never handed anything to us nicely.   Not sure why he was so rude but it's really unprofessional. The food was okay but the service ruined our mood.   We ordered the foie gras, it was nicely seared. The sauce that came with it complimented the foie gras well. But the gingerbread wasn't our thing.   The Duck Confit was crispy in the outside (skin) and pretty soft on the inside (meats). The meat fell off the bone easily. The flavour was okay but it was a bit dry. It came on a salad with potatoes.   The beef cheek was really soft. Flavour was okay but it was really salty. It came with some green beans.   Overall, the restaurant was nice, food was decent. Nothing exceptional. Service was horrible."}
{"text":"Pretty good place.  I would probably give it 3.5 stars if I could.  Busy atmosphere.   I had the salmon tartare with french fries and was pleased with the meal, but not blown away.  Not overly expensive, but I would not consider this place to be a good deal."}
{"text":"We popped in on a rainy night and were able to find a table. It appears they seat their customers by language-- French in one section, English in another. No big deal- just an observation. The food is good and is served quickly. The grilled vegetable couscous with merguez is delicious! Holder is very generous with the amount of merguez they serve. mmmmm!"}
{"text":"Modern French Cuisine. Recommended by the hotel concierge. Great atmosphere with upscale clientele from surrounding business district. Lunch menu includes a fixe option including a salad/soup or main. Items served with fries offer substitute of any side. Pricing is appropriate for upscale dining. Medium crowd at lunch. Weekends offer brunch as well."}
{"text":"Came here last Friday night around 8pm with a group of 10.  Hopping with people and a great atmosphere.  Not the place to go for a quiet dinner as it was quiet noisy but maybe that was our group making all the noise!  Food was good although I found it pricey for what I got.  I had the Lamb special which was great but not good enough for $30.  Service was surprisingly attentive given how busy they were.  We were settling in for a 20-30 minute wait at the bar (yes, we showed up w/o a reservation) when our table came up after only a 5 minute wait!  Tried my friends Talapia and it was quite nice and more reasonably priced that the Lamb special.  Steaks were reportedly good as well.  I will definitely return next time I am in town."}
{"text":"Service was good.  However, the food was just okay. We went here on late Saturday afternoon and they only have lunch/brunch menu.  I ordered Veal Steak Frites, it was just okay. Sauce was okay, no flavor and under seasoned.  They do have good ambiance and decor.  I would only go here if there is no other place to go or when you are in a pinch and extremely hungry."}
{"text":"Spectacular restaurant. Spectacular service. And most of all, spectacular food. Beef tartare is one of the best we've had there. And the braised beef cheek was mouth watering and tender. Literally did not even have to chew it. Just melted in your mouth. Reservations were not necessary but I would recommend it."}
{"text":"Very good food at reasonable price. Had the braised beef cheek - full of flavor and melted in mouth. Mussels cooked to perfection. Waiter was incredibly sweet. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"'Such a busy place with good old-Montreal ambiance! It was a little loud inside, so not the best option for intimate conversations. However, if you're there for the food, then this is a lovely option.  I had the duck confit and it was delicious. I would definitely return again."}
{"text":"Really tasty place with warm ambiance.  My family got the French onion soup, pasta, duck and salmon.  All of us were very pleased with our choices.  We ended the meal with a pineapple turnover which was fantastic."}
{"text":"I'm surprised this place gets 4-5 stars. In my opinion, it is ok. There are much better places in Montreal.   Sundays are tough to find a place open in Old Montreal. We ate at Holder because it was walking distance from our hotel and other places were full or closed.  The restaurant decor is nice. It was certainly busy. It is supposed to be a traditional French restaurant. Um, not so sure about that. Very Americanized in my opinion.  My first complaint was our food came out way too fast. This tells me everything is pre cooked before you even order, then heated up.  My husband had the vegetable soup, which came out cold.  I started with the French Onion soup. It was too sweet and did not have enough onion taste.  We went with the special, which was cod. This was a nice dish. The fish was perfectly cooked with a wonderful finish. It was served on a bed of Israeli cous cous, which complemented it nicely.   If you are looking for a great French restaurant, this is not it. Not awful, but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Just happen to walk by this evening; the menu looked interesting, as did the crowd inside. A typically busy restaurant, there were no open tables, so we elected to sit at the bar. That decision made all the difference for us as bar-man Julian was the perfect host, bartender and waiter.  Food was very good, Mixed Greens, Fresh Oysters, Vegetable Soup, were excellent starters. Strip Steak and Duck Confit were wonderful Entrees. The Butterscotch Mi-Cuit was an amazing finish, Très bien Holder."}
{"text":"Excellent food and courteous service. Had the onion soup starter which was tasty. Not the best I've had but good. The mozzarella pesto salad was very good - served with prosciutto and sweet figs and pine nuts. The big finish was a very solid creek brûlée. My companion had a melt in your mouth beef cheek entree that was extremely well prepared. No complaints and I left very satisfied."}
{"text":"Trip advisor was definitely right about this place. I loved the fact that it is placed in Old Montreal and we came on a thursday night , it was packed yet the waiters found us a table right away. We ordered the frise salad which was great for an appetizer. We followed with mussels and lobster ravioli as entrees. The food literally melts in your mouth to how good and fresh it is. The staff is very attentive , place is great and the food is delciious - what can more can you want ? Will be back again for sure !"}
{"text":"It was my second time to visit here and I always order the duck confit as recommended by many and it never fails me every time. It was done by perfection, it was crispy, greasy and together with arugula and potatoes on the side makes it an exceptional meal. I will aways make sure to visit here every time I'm in town."}
{"text":"We came for dinner before fireworks and everything was phenomenal, I had the gazpacho and the lobster ravioli and while it didn't look like much in the plate ... The serving amount was perfect. You finish your plate but don't leave hungry. The lemon cream dessert was amazing , my boyfriend had the chocolate mousse and also loved it. In terms of quality vs price , the prices are definitely fair"}
{"text":"We arrived at 8:25 for our 8:30 reservation and sat at the bar for a few minutes. The restaurant is spacious but crowded. We had a table for five and started with two salads and two appetizers: the calamari, the goat cheese on puff pastry, salad with pear and blue de benedictin and frisée with lardons all delicious. Then our table ordered the French onion soup, the country soup, moules frites meunière et anise avec creme and the special veal chop. All cooked perfectly and served with aplomb. We ordered three desserts: truffles, profiteroles and a chocolate ganache. The sever recommended an excellent Chilean wine for our meal.  All in all a very good meal"}
{"text":"Eaten here twice on this trip, this time lunch. Both meals where great as was the service"}
{"text":"Wife had fritata I had french toast with apples and syrup. Wow wow wow. Awesomely good. Service was great an attentive, despite my american idiocy of not understanding english in a french accent.....chedaaaaaa meant cheddar and the rest i didnt understand either, but was irrelevant because my taste buds comprends just fine."}
{"text":"I ordered moules frites (mussels and fries), but unfortunately they were out, so I got the lobster ravioli. It tasted fine, but a forgettable dish. I had the creme brulee for dessert. Also tasted nice, but forgettable.   My dining companions really liked their dishes. I snagged a few fries from a friend and the fries were indeed very crispy, tender, and delicious. *sigh* It just made me wish I could have had my moules frites.   The restaurant has a lovely old-fashioned moneyed old boys' club feel. I think it's all the big heavy food and impressively large bar. The service was pretty good overall, especially considering how large our party was."}
{"text":"I came to Montreal with zero experience and quickly found myself lost. I stumbled into what I thought was a bar but enjoyed the BEST French toast and a ridiculous wait staff. They were knowledgeable and friendly. The Bartenders Domenic and Chris are amazing!!! Enjoy"}
{"text":"Update: I received a message from the owner with a very genuine apology and an offer I may take up which is to contact him so he can arrange an evening that I could enjoy. He also will be looking into who the server was which is appreciated.   I was very excited to come and try this place. I've heard lots of good things. This is why my first and last experience here was such a massive disappointment.   Prior to coming I took and look at the menu online and made my dinner choice, we were 8 adults and 4 kids. I was informed upon  entering the restaurant that there was a child's menu which I was happy about.   We were seated and then handed a set menu because we were more than 10 people. I explained to the hostess that the kids were ordering from a set menu and asked if I could get the full menu. He refused even though the rest of the party was fine and was placing orders based on their set menu. I ordered a coffee.   My husband ordered the flank steak, it came raw. We asked that it be cooked, when it came back it went from a 7oz portion to a 3 oz portion, now Im not a pro chef but I do cook and there is never that much shrinkage. When the waiter was asked he simply said it was always that size.   The rest of the party didn't rave about the food either, maybe it's all the hype that we expected something out of this world.   To make it worst, we asked another waiter to bring us napkins and he let us know he wasn't the waiter but he would get it anyway. When our waiter was at our table he proceeded to tell or waiter to take care of us cause we're pains in the ass and are constantly asking him for things.   Super unprofessional. We won't be back."}
{"text":"This was our first dinner in Montreal and it was great! It has a very bistro-like atmosphere and reminded us of La Coupole in Paris or Balthazar in NYC.  There were lots of locals, rather than tourists, there.  I had steak frites, which was really good, and my husband had fish and chips.  The wait staff was good and spoke both French and English. It wasn't particularly cheap but we didn't expect it to be. I certainly would have gone back if we'd had another night during our too-brief vacation."}
{"text":"A neat spot and a menu that makes it hard to choice just one entree! The host was a lovely addition to attentive service, delivering our wine himself. We went early (6:30p) on a Sunday and were sat right away, one of only a few tables. But they sat tables continuously after ours, filling up by the time left around 8:30. Faves were the duck confit, chevre chaud and chocolat cremeux! Lobster ravioli was excellent, too (not overbearing)."}
{"text":"Magnifique!  Salmon tartare was my favorite in the city.  Duck confit was also delicious.  Lovely space, comfortable saloon-like (wood and brass) room.  Excellent friendly service."}
{"text":"The best meal we had in Montreal. The beef cheek was amazing."}
{"text":"Just order what your server recommends.  I had the warm goat cheese on a crispy cracker with olive tapanade for an appetizer and the butterscotch/ caramel dessert and they were out of this world.  I insisted on the lobster ravioli which was fine but not in the same planetary orbit as the others.    Service was about the best ever...it was the Fourth of July and the waiter brought my dessert with a sparkler on it...all the waiters came by to wish me happy birthday!  I know some people consider it \"noisy\" but it's such a happy noise.  It's the sound of  people having a wonderful time over wonderful food.  It made me absurdly happy just to sit there and observe all the little scenes playing out around me.  And then they fed me too!  I just floated back to Le Petit Hotel."}
{"text":"I tried it last August (2015), and it was that great that I had it again, as my last dinner in Montreal!! From the outside, it looks like a business building, but inside it has a nice ambiance, without too much decor.   The servers were friendly and got what we wanted in a timely manner.   Happy:  The menu is mostly French inspired and selective. If you go to the washroom, you can see the open kitchen. I ordered the duck confit with potatoes and a bed of arugula salad which is a nice touch with all the meat I'll be eating. The duck meat was tender and came off the bone which I like. The portion was enough for dinner and leaving some room for dessert.  For dessert, we shared a lemon cream with mascarpone cheese and coconut sorbet. Our second time!!   Not happy: None that I can think of. Even the washroom is clean and bright. A bonus!   Verdict:  Been here twice since I am not from Montreal. So it means - I'll be back in the future!!"}
{"text":"Excellent Sunday Brunch.  Good friendly service.  We had a reservation.  I'd suggest that.  I had eggs.  Bacon. Yummy potatoes.  Included a small smoothie and bagel.  I like my bagel with a little more crunch ( warmer ). But was still good.  Everyone else enjoyed too.  A definite yes."}
{"text":"Great environment and the bestest thing was the dessert. We went twice to have there profiteroles they are amazing."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant in an equally beautiful building.   Came with 3 coworkers on a Weds. night around 7 and was glad to have a reservation - the place was pretty crowded.  We all started off with some Canadian beer and decided to skip appetizers. 3 of us ordered the T-bone & pommefrites, another ordered tilapia.   No sooner had I sipped my beer, my entree was set down in front of me. A little too quick, I felt like there was no time to relax.  T-bone was so-so....cut very thin. Since I asked for mine rare, it was barely cooked (obviously) and not hot, the butter they put on top wouldn't really melt.  Pommefrites were also nothing special...flavor was there but they were more soggy than crispy.  Overall, fun/nice atmosphere with mediocre food; I think you can do better."}
{"text":"Excellent service and excellent food even at the end of the day. They serve food and drinks right up until closing which is very convenient. The steak tartare was excellent and the pappardelle was very rich and tasty ( a little too decadent but very good). I ended the night with the lemon cream and mascarpone mousse, which was the highlight for me. This was one of the best desserts I've had. Have it with a side of honey and tea."}
{"text":"Yummy French food! I got the duck confit and it was amaaaaaazing. The combination of duck/arugula salad/ and some potato bites was just unbelievable. The skin of the duck is so crispy and the meat is very tender. My bf ordered the beef cheek (I forgot the name) but literally the meat melts in your mouth... you won't regret it.   One thing that I didn't enjoy was the French onion soup. Perhaps I like salty food but the dish was just too light for me... But I am giving this place a five because everything else trumps the soup.   Treat yourself :)"}
{"text":"Once again great restaurant . I had their Braised beef cheek again. Very tender, flavorful , sitting in excellent savory mash and French string beans. Very good choc mousse - could be less sweet . Great service."}
{"text":"Probably the best French food I had so far. And oh dear, your service is well mannered and everyone is professional to do their jobs well! Thank you  Location: I think they are located in old town in Montreal. We were just walking and walking and my dad saw many people inside this place and asked if we could go there. Well, of course! We headed into the place and they had a full bar on the right hand side and they served lunch and brunch at the time when we got in.   Food: I had duck confit like always and my parents and Calf 's liver. Both are delicious as hell. My duck confit is crispy outside but inside is warm and tendered. The only bad part is that it 's bit salty to me. But the saltines is quickly balanced with veggies and potatoes on the side. I did not try my parents' liver but they told me that it's delicious. Oh, and we had their soup, potato soup for the day. Very balanced and smoothly, I wish I could had another stomach to finish another soup.  Service: Thank you for the good serve. As you know, I aint French speaking person. English is my second language and that's about it. I have no experience of speaking French at all so when I stepped into this place, I was little nervous. But the lady was bilingual and speak English well to treat us to a seat with window. In addition, when my parents got their soups faster than me, they came here and asked if anything went wrong and correct their delays for my soup. I was very moved because such thing has never happened back in USA. Thanks for the service!  Overall: although less famous than other places, holder is a place to try some traditional and legit French good with some caring service.  5 stars for sure."}
{"text":"Endive salad w blue cheese outstanding.  I like that they have demi-bottles of wine. Whole bottle can be too much for a couple sometimes.  Entrecôte de beouf was good.  Vegetarian dining partner was informed the papparadelli pasta could not be made vegetarian. Spaghetti with ricotta seemed very heavy. Waiter  assured us he veg couscous would be flavorful. When we were served, he failed to inform us the veg broth brought was on the side. We didn't know what it was. He should've told us it was supposed to be poured (the whole thing) into the couscous.  They need to have some more flavorful interesting vegetarian options.  Butterscotch mi-cuit is divine.  Service was prompt. Place is busy."}
{"text":"Toujours un bon choix pour le lunch, même pour le soir ou le 5@7.  La bavette de veau est vraiment très bonne. Le service super attentionné, l'ambiance assez dynamique, peut-être un peu bruyant, mais l'expérience est très agréable et positive. Choix de vin correct peut-être un peu limité au verre, mais raisonnable.  J'aime beaucoup cet endroit."}
{"text":"The food at Holder was definitely above par. I really enjoyed my beef cheek bourguignon and my friends enjoyed their tartare and steak. The atmosphere was exactly the type we were looking for, a relatively louder bistro.  Service was great and extremely helpful although it was very busy."}
{"text":"Beautiful space, and fantastic food to boot. What's fun is to enjoy the lively atmosphere, then take a step outside and realize how well the place is soundproofed - the joie de vive inside is simply bottled up.  A very relaxed pace to service - it doesn't feel neglectful in any way, rather, the tempo allows you to relax and fully enjoy your meal.  The moule frites are simply amazing- frites seemed to be double fried (as they should), and the patsis broth was an awesome accompaniment for the mussels.  There must have been 5 or 6 dozen mussels presented in a giant bowl, with at least three smaller bowls to accommodate the empty shells.   Top notch all around..."}
{"text":"Belle ambiance, tres bon service, bonne bouffe. Juste pourquoi garder quelques vielles chaises pas tres confo ici et là. Demandez une banquette si le confort est plus important pour vous que de vous s'asseoir sur le oldy deco ;)"}
{"text":"Decent place for lunch.  Lively environment. Friendly, professional staff."}
{"text":"Excellent!!! Came here for dinner on New Year's Eve, and had the beef cheek. Food was excellent, and service quite attentive, for such a busy night."}
{"text":"Holder was recommended to me by my hotel as a great French restaurant. The restaurant has the perfect lighting and vibe for a first or second date. Unfortunately, I was traveling on business, but enjoyed myself over by the bar area. I gnashed on the lovely selection of toasted breads and salted butter they brought out while I drank a local red ale. I asked the server for his recommendations and decided upon the braised beef cheek à la bourguignonne, which is braised for six hours. The meat literally just fell apart in my mouth it was so tender. The dish was also perfectly sized so that I was full but not overly so. Thanks for a lovely evening!"}
{"text":"Great service for brunch and even better crepes. Plus, my cappuccino had to have been one of the best I've had in Montreal. Would highly recommend this restaurant for a Saturday brunch. And it's not overpriced either !"}
{"text":"I've been here for both brunch and dinner and I absolutely love it. The food is great on all fronts, and has refined tastes that really communicates authenticity in French cuisine. The service is similarly professional and very courteous. I've always been a fan of high service standards in the boulangerie-type restaurant, and Holder really delivers. On top of that, the atmosphere is so great. Both morning and evening have a great view outside with large windows, and the interior is wonderfully designed in a classic bistro fashion that reminds me of the famous NYC restaurant Balthazar. The price is not low by any means but neither is it high for the quality of the experience here. Highly recommend this restaurant. P.S. also a great wine selection."}
