{"text":"When it comes to Vincenzo's, I'm officially a bit of an addict. Funny enough, I've never set place in the actual shop - I order my food from them via Grubhub. So this review is purely for food and delivery service.

Why do I say I'm a bit of an addict? Because when it comes to pizza places, it's often really, really hard for me to find reasonably portioned pizzas. Seriously - if you set a pizza in front of me, I will eat most of, if not all, of it. And when even most small pizzas are pretty huge, this means that often I just have to forgo pizza delivery in favor of a smarter dinner option. But then there's Vincenzo's, which actually has an appetizer that is basically a small four-piece pizza with any toppings you pick. Yum! And the one I got was still fresh from the oven - it was a little circle of cheesy, topping loaded heaven.

Also, I really enjoy being able to order soup from here - it's a handy go-to if I'm feeling too sick to cook. You have to like Wedding or Chicken Noodle when ordering through GrubHub, but hey, it works for me! And by the way: LOVE their cheesecake! I had a piece of Oreo cheesecake tonight that was really quite good. Not Cheesecake Factory good, sure, but sometimes, you just want a bit of chocolate, and boy does this place meet that requirement!

As for the people, from my experience they're really considerate. I may order through an app most of the time, but if there's a problem, the staff has no problem calling me right up to let me know and offer an alternative. They've always delivered about 30 minutes ahead of the projected time, too - talk about speedy!

Honestly, since I'm paying about $11 per order WITH a 15% tip to this place, I really can't complain. And even though the food isn't the greatest EVAR, I like it. They're affordable, they're reasonable, and honestly, sometimes you just need a few basics: pizza, soup, sandwiches, cheesecake, whatever. Thanks for being my go-to for some pretty good basics, guys!"}

{"text":"Well, the food, was meh.  I ordered twice from them.  The first time, the pizza was okay.  Nothing special and the order was over 45 minutes late.  I know places get busy, but they were quite rude when I tried to find out what happened to my food.  The second order was over an hour late.  Then the delivery driver tried to blame me, when he clearly had the wrong address (and I showed him the receipt proving he made a mistake).  Still, it wasn't enough to make it that late.  And the hoagies I ordered (Italian Sausage and my friend's was a Meatball) were less than yummy.  My sausage hoagie looked like they used the \"so-called\" Italian sausage that looks like hot dogs and put that on a hoagie with pizza sauce.  So, between two orders that we VERY late and lackluster and disappointing food, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"I am completely heartbroken. Vincenzo's switched ownership, and their food quality has definitely suffered.  The sauce and cheese were really bland, and you can tell that it came from cans. Wings were overcooked and tough.  They didn't even include ranch or bluecheese for dipping. WTF?  *sigh*  I guess I'm on the hunt for a new pizza staple."}

If Domino's and Pizza Hut united to create an acceptable pie, you might have a rough estimate of what Vincenzo's offers. You'll get that puffy crust with loads of nooks and crannies, a sweet sauce, plenty of cheese, and in the case of a Meat Lover's Pizza, oodles of proteins. The delivery was prompt, our hunger was satisifed, and that's pretty much all there is to say, Vincenzo's being a pedestrian pizza parlor in a revolving-door locale."}
{"text":"This used to be our go-to delivery place, but they must have changed owners or management or something. Regardless, the pizza comes cold, the cheese is partially melted, it tastes frozen, and tonight they took 2 hours before I called the manager and refused delivery. Late, cold, crappy pizza? No thanks, I'll spend my cash elsewhere."}
