{"text":"Food and service were not bad 
But the restaurant wants to charge 5% on top of you pay by credit card 
This is ridiculous they have no right to do that 
They could said they don't accept credit card but has no right to charge the 5% service charge 
Hope everyone can share this"}
{"text":"So far so good, considering the price and services. It is not a very popular location but it looks the business is getting better and better."}
{"text":"I've had plenty of food Hunan food in LA, so have pretty high standards.This place is decent, but not great. First of all, it's just not very spicy. I didn't really need water. I guess this can be a good thing or a bad thing depending on your preferences. 

The dishes are decent... not fantastic, but not bad either. If I hadn't had the good  stuff before, I think I probably would have enjoyed it more, and been a repeat customer. 

Def worth trying, but don't go out of your way for it."}
{"text":"This is one of the best spicy Chinese food I been to so far. My favourite dish is the duck and the spicy fish. The best of it you can bring your wine and liquor and there is no cord charge. The price is not expensive and the service is very good. If you like spicy food this is the place."}
{"text":"We ordered 2 noodles for lunch.  

1) The Braised Beef Soup Noodle (?????) was solid good.  It was better than many I had had at Taiwanese restaurants.  The broth tasted rich and appropriately oily with a heat that was not torturous.  We opted for making it mildly spicy, yet you could ask to make it spicier.  

2) The Home Style Stir Fried Vermicelli (?????) used Gui Lin Vermicelli.  It looked like a Canadian interpretation of a Chinese stir fried noodle that one might get at a chop suey Chinese restaurant.  The flavour was just right, not over seasoned.  If only they used a thinner vermicelli instead of the Gui Lin vermicelli, this dish would fit right in an authentic Northern Chinese restaurant.  

The cooking techniques of both noodles were authentic Chinese.  I could not taste or feel any MSG in the food.

The menu of this Hunan Restaurant and Bar looks identical to the Hunan Style Restaurant on Silver Star Blvd in Scarborough.  I suspect the two restaurants may be related."}
{"text":"Nice and inexpensive. Lots of vegetarian choices. We ordered the spicy stir fried eggplant and a dish with lotus root. The eggplant dish was the best eggplant dish I've had across cuisines. The lotus root dish was good but a bit crunchy for my liking. With drinks and 2 rice orders, it came to around  $30 with tip. Serving sizes are big - there will be enough for two lunches tomorrow as well.

This restaurant is located inside the Thornhill square mall, at a location that has seen multiple restaurants come and go. Hope these guys are here for keeps."}
{"text":"A hidden restaurant in the Thornhill Square plaza, it is easy to miss this place. We were curious about the food here and dropped by for dinner. Most items on the menu was spicy with select few that are not. The one spicy dish we ordered was the cabbage in chili oil with meat which was delicious. The non spicy dishes we got which include mei chai kou zhou with steamed bun, and lamb stew were pretty bland and below expectations. Your best bet is to choose spicy dishes as that is their specialty. That is, if you can handle the heat of course."}
{"text":"Service was good and food was average. It was too Grissy and it had a weird smell. we didn't not wait for too long on the food. environment was comfortable. It was empty when I visited the place on a Saturday lunch time, but didn't mind that."}
{"text":"I was with two Chinese companions who warned me: \"It is Spicy!\"

I told them, \"I LIKE SPICY,\" and they proceeded to order the 6-7 most spicy menu items: Pork and Green Peppers, Chicken and Red Peppers, some sort of sliced spicy potato, a spicy scrambled egg dish, spicy noodles, rice, and corn buns.

I came, I sweat, I conquered. All was delicious

Service was helpful, and prompt: Some wizened employee, speaking chinese helpfully steered us through the menu. 

Extra napkins were provided so I could towel off."}
{"text":"Hunan cuisine is known for being dry hot and it can be really hot! 

Hunan Restaurant and Bar as the name implies it is specialized in Hunan cuisine. So be prepared! If you cannot take the heat, you will definitely not good to able to enjoy some of the authentic dishes.

Hunan cuisine uses a lot of fresh peppers. I do love fresh peppers but I did overdose  that evening...

We ordered:

Mixed Cold Dishes ($6.95)
- Nice and refreshing with raw carrot, cucumber, peanuts, cured meat
- Seasoned with just enough spiciness with chili hot and cilantro
- I feel like drinking a beer 

Stir Fried A-Vegetables with Black Bean and Chili ($8.95)
- The spiciness and the tartness gave this dish an interesting complex taste
- Fresh chili uses to spice up the dish!
- Hot! I feel like drinking a beer

Pork with Garlic and Steamed Corn Bun ($9.95)
- Cured pork with more chili! 
- Don't mistaken those green strips as green onion....
- hot and salty... the cured pork is quite tender
- Hot! Hot! I need a beer!

Stuffed Pork Pancake ($4.95)
- Though the filling were juicy but with all the other spicy dishes it is hard to taste the seasoning
- This is the only non spicy dish we ordered for the night and it was served at the end
- I don't like the wrapping as it was pan fried to crispy and it is way too hard 

The decoration here is nice and roomy compare to other places I been to. 

It is located at the back of the shopping plaza so might be hard to locate. But just circle around you will not miss those flashing blue lights!

Hunan has over 4,000 dishes, I might have to come back again and again to just have a taste of other dishes! But I don't think my Yelp friend can handle all these heat.. WATER please!"}
