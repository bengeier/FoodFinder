{"text":"It's still awesome even if Yelp keeps burying my good review. I'm a regular here for good reason: pizza and pastas are fantastic. The house salad doesn't cheap out with iceberg it's got heft.
My new favorite pizza is the Francesco's pizza which has- well I don't know what it has on it but I love it.
So not leave without having the garlic knots. They are soft, buttery, and great."}
{"text":"We got the meat lovers pizza delivered tonight. Possibly the best pizza we've ever had, definitely the best in the area! The delivery took very long, so next time we will probably either go in or do a pick-up, but very delicious pizza! 

They also had good soup and salad!"}
{"text":"Always great food, my wife loves the Greek Salad with  grilles chicken and the Pizza Bianca is one of the best I've had."}
{"text":"Not sure why there are so many reviews that are being excluded, but I like the place.  They make a great bruschetta."}
{"text":"There is a difference between a 5% discount for cash and a 5% surcharge for using a credit card. If you have a posted price and then you add a 5% fee to it and say (discount for cash removed) that is a very low class way of hiding a surcharge."}
{"text":"This place is great!  My wife and I live around the corner and have been back several times already.  Everything we have had has been wonderful.  The spinach salad with grilled chicken, the wings, pasta, pizza, and of course the garlic knots!!!  All of the ingredients taste so fresh.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Very friendly service with excellent pizza and wings. The food is always fresh and delicious every time we go. This place has become our weekly go to for great food!!!"}
{"text":"No doubt the best pizza and salad any time of day. .friendly staff and quite reasonable prices make the food that much better. ."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for dinner.  One of the owners is our friend, so we were excited to check it out.  The decor is very warm and welcoming - very cute place.  It's mainly for take-out but there are several tables for you to dine in.  We had the bruschetta - DELICIOUS!  It's not served on ordinary bread.  Highly recommend it.  We tried the pepperoni pizza and a sausage pizza roll.  Both were very good.  The pepperoni and sausage were especially good - great flavor.  We took the tiramisu to go - this was also very tasty.  We'll definitely go again and not just because it's our friend's place."}
{"text":"Dropping for lunch. Food was so so at best. Tables needed to be wiped off. Overall impression was that this is a place I'll drive past in the future."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and not too pricey. Rice balls were off the chain and the pizza was delicious."}
{"text":"Service was slow and incorrect. You can't put forth anymore than 2 orders for one ticket. They will mess it up"}
{"text":"Best pizza and calzones in the area. The Florentine calzone is my favorite and my wife loves the pizza rolls. The lasagna pizza is one of a kind. 

They also catered our wedding. They were helpful and everyone loved the food. 

The staff is friendly and the place is always clean."}
{"text":"Hubby and I are always searching out n ew pizza places to try so we figured we give Francesco's a try earlier this evening. We live in the Sun Valley area so being it so close to home , why not?  Well, all I can say is, don't bother. The pizza was undercooked , very little cheese and the sauce lacked any flavor. If you really want good pizza , go across the street to Brooklyn Pizza and order one---they never disappoint and being born and raised in the borough of Brooklyn (New York) I can attest to good authentic NY pizza. If you really want to venture out of Union county the all time favorite of ours is Villa Francesca uptown. Louis Suppa is originally from Brooklyn and he makes the most outstanding pizza you can imagine---there is no mistaking this pizza for a NYC devotee. Just the best all around."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch. Good daily specials, very fresh ingredients. Crust had a nice crispness to it. I had the Chicken Parm special slice and my friend had the Meat lovers, both were good! Will be back again."}
{"text":"We had ordered from this place prior on several occasions but after this evening, we are done. After placing an order at 6:45pm as of 8:30pm, the order still was not right after two trips back, having the staff read the information off to us on both occasions. Tallya told us that they would be sending four blue cheese dressings back since they sent ranch on the second run.  When I called at 9:30pm, I was told by the Manager on Duty that he would not give his name or anyone else's name out who was involved and that Luigi, the owner, said not to get the order right and not to try to fix it so as of now, I paid for an order that I have yet to receive correct in its entirety. The Manager on Duty further accosted me by making unfounded allegations after he said he had delivered food to my house on 6 occasions and knew we were good repeat customers.  At that point, I told him we would no longer be patronizing the establishment. After looking at the YELP reviews, it seems poor customer service and subpar service are indicative of this establishment.  We will also be contacting the BBB as my order is still not complete and I have taken pics of all of it,"}
{"text":"Tried Francesco's yesterday for dinner. Hubby ordered a regular cheese pizza; it was awesome. I had a personal size white pizza; great! The homemade tiramisu was as delicious. Teen son ordered cheesecake, but they were out. Frank informed us he is baking today. I was impressed he makes everything from scratch.
Would highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Had great chicken marsala, just the right flavor and pasta was also al dente!! Pizza crust had the best combination of crunch and chew. Really recommend this little place."}
{"text":"Love this little Italian place! Ordered dinner last night from here and they delivered which was awesome! The pizza is good and so is the Lasagna and Salad that we ordered."}
{"text":"Great pizza place to order from. The pizza was delicious and the Delivery was fast !!!"}
{"text":"The food is horrible. We got delivery. We were told the food would be delivered within an hour .... it was not delivered until an hour and 45 minutes later. The food was cold and the sauce tasted worse than a sauce from a can. The sandwich we ordered had more bread than chicken. 
The canolli left a waxy film in your mouth and was almost melted. I will never order food from this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Although somewhat hard to find, Francescas is a decent little pizza joint once you do find it. My two buddies and I ate there midweek prior to a movie and needed lunch in a hurry. We all ordered the lunch special which is two large pieces of NY style cheese pizza and fountain drink for $5.99.

The pizza was very good and the dining area was neat and clean, despite the fact that it looks more like a Chinese restaurant than a pizza parlor. Manager (or owner) did  not appear to be overly enthusiastic but the dining room was half full when we left. Sanitary rating was a 96 and bathroom was also clean. Would probably stop in again if in the area and pressed for time."}
{"text":"Love this place.  We've only had the pizza, but we go back again and agin for their garlic knots and margharita pizza.  It's so good. 
This place is very small, but they deliver and you can carry out, as well."}
{"text":"Decent hole in the wall pizza place. Ordered a large pie. Was a little doughy and not crispy as requested, but still good. The service was great and the inside is cozy. Would visit again. Also, claimed our free garlic knots for using this app...they were amazing! The prices are extremely affordable, would use cheap, but not such a nice word to associate with this nice establishment."}
{"text":"I had never noticed place before, but when I did decide to try it, it was very good.  I didn't expect much from what looked like a hole in the wall pizza place but I was very pleasantly surprised.  I will likely be back again."}
{"text":"For a thin crust pizza, it's unusually doughy. Vodka penne is a small serving, but that worked in our favor. It has the strangest odor, and after tasting we found it inedible. Garlic knots hit the spot."}
{"text":"The best pizza, stromboli's and calzones in town! We love, love, love Francesco's Pizzeria!!! Delivery guys are always super friendly and fast!!!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious.  They make their own croutons.  The Italian dressing is very good and the pizza and crust was tasty.  Fresh and homemade food."}
{"text":"Ordered from here one time for delivery. I live in the Brandon Oaks neighborhood and gave them the address of the club house because I was at the pool with the kids and needed to feed them lunch. The pizza took an hour and forty five minutes to arrive. The buffalo chicken pizza was awful and the crust was equally terrible. Did not enjoy this at all."}
{"text":"Food is good, but they seem to have some service issues to straighten out. This is the second time we've ordered pickup from them, and both times their time estimates have been way off (don't say 30 minutes if it takes 45). 

That's not so bad, but this last time, they left an item off of the order. It was on the receipt, but just didn't make it to the kitchen. They rush prepared, but didn't try to offer anything for the extra wait.  Hoping it's cooked when I get home (I had time to write this on my phone while I waited). 

Without the service issues, this would be a solid 4."}
{"text":"Very nice hole in the wall restaurant, quiet and great atmosphere. Ordered a 10\" personal pizza with sausage and pepperoni, the food was delicious. Staff was very nice and friendly. It was my very first time coming to Francesco's and I will gladly return!"}
{"text":"We saw the great ratings and stopped off before heading home from the holidays. While the food was great (did the Family Special), it took 45+ minutes to get our pizza while dining in. They must specialize in take out orders - saw about 10 of those go out the door while waiting for ours."}
{"text":"Our first visit here...sad experience. It is 98° out today and I think it was the same in the restaurant. It was too hot to enjoy anything. We ordered two pasta dishes (Alfredo and penne alla vodka). The menu said the pasta dishes come with bread and you can add a side salad for $2. We each asked to add the side house. We were never given the bread. We were brought FULL entree sized house salads. We asked \"Are these the side salads? That's what we orderd.\" The young girl who was waitressing just answered \"No, those are the full.\" Then walked away. Our pasta came out and when we asked for parmesan cheese, we were brought an next to empty shaker. Our pasta was fine, but at this point it is so hot in the restaurant we were sweating and had to box up our meal to enjoy later in the comfort of A.C. While checking out we noticed we were charged for the full salads we didn't order, but they wouldn't rectify that mistake. I think the problem may be having such a very young staff with none of them knowing how to manage situations like these. Food was fine and prices were ideal, but we were just disappointed when we did not receive what we ordered, were charged for their mistakes, and left drenched in sweat. We may give this place one more chance, but will get it TO-GO."}
{"text":"Tucked away in a little plaza. It's a cozy little restaurant. Don't be fooled by the size, the food is great! It was our first trip here so we tried a few different things. The rice balls are a must! The sauce is homemade. The pizzas are great too"}
{"text":"I have dine in here several occasions, great food. My dissatisfaction today, I ordered their 2 slice pizza Special with a drink and was told that they ran out of unsweetened tea, Sitting here one guy on his cell phone the cashier behind the register doing nothing chatting laughing with other co-workers and now looking into her phone but no time to make Unsweetened Tea? This behavior and customer care unacceptable in today Restaurant industry, likely today will be my last visit. Let's keep in mind that I am the only customer inside the restaurant right now."}
{"text":"Small storefront location in Sun Valley strip mall area across from Sun Valley high school. Maybe 10 tables and all,  and you order at the counter judging from the people going in and out, they do a lot of carry out.

Very good food, and daily specials. Casual dress, unisex bathrooms, waitress brings your food to the table,large parking lot and bar in movie theater close by."}
{"text":"The pizza here was not the worse I've ever tasted but the service left a bad taste in our mouths for sure! The waitress was awkward and seemed to be confused by the menu prices and the wait time to actually get our pizza was a good 40 minutes and we were given paper plates to eat on. I don't think I've ever had that happen at a sit down \"restauraunt\" where I had to pay 25.00 bucks. Right before we had to go ask for a to go box an older couple came in, sat down, ordered there pizza and we're brought Real plates by who appeared to be the manager or owner. After only 15 minutes which was less than half the time it took to get ours, their pizza was brought to them with a warm and friendly greeting. Not to mention our drinks remained empty half the time we were eatting. Needless to say we felt snubbed and will not be returning."}
{"text":"Love the way they cook the wings !
Nice \"crunch\" I have been unable to find elsewhere, and the pizza taste great.
The Price is so much cheaper than other Italian places nearby and the kids absolutely loved the Garlic Knots. 
I'd like to try em' out on another day before I give 5 stars, if they can meet my expectations I'll update my review..
I'm dying to try the Spaghetti and Meatballs!"}
{"text":"I don't know whats up with all the 5 star ratings on here, most likely friends and family of the owners (fake reviews).

Where to start.....Location is a nice spot, little strip mall in front of the new Sun Valley movie theaters.  Upon entry the place feels more like an uptown Charlotte greasy spoon.  There are literally like 6 tables in the place, generic counter, generic decorations, drop ceilings, awkward wall hiding the kitchen.  Everything is so cramped.  

There is no waitress, rather.. the high school girl at the register comes around to \"wait\" on you.  Forget about timely drink refills.....despite you are 1 of 6 tables and literally 10 feet away from the register.  No lemonade on fountain so its $1.25 per can (which is not mentioned unit the bill is totaled up).  My girlfriend was brought a glass of ice for her can of lemonade (Minutemaid) but there was some sticky nugget of garlic bread or some sorta random morsel of food stuck on the inside rim of the glass.  Eww....she used her straw in the can.  

Got the fried cheese appetizer.  They look like crab cakes but they are really bland patties of mozzarella-like cheese curds with a deep fried coating of breadcrumbs.  The cheese was tasteless and the only taste the breadcrumbs had was of all the other foods cooked in the same deep fryer oil in the last few weeks.  Come on...even McDonald's has clean tasting fry oil.  The marinara sauce had the consistency of tomato soup and the color of Spaghettios sauce.  

Got the pizza....boy we were hungry....and...well.....it sure looked good.....but after the first bite my GF and I looked at each other in silence.  The crust is underproofed.  They dont let it rise long enough and they don't use enough yeast....thus its doughy and bland just as reviewer \"Doris P\" mentioned.  It literally tastes like a thick doughy UNSALTED Saltine cracker.  The crust literally has no taste, needs yeast and needs more salt.  The marinara....well.....already covered that.  The pepperoni was average.  The cheese on the pizza is cheap low moisture mozzarella which starts to harden the minute the pizza is not piping hot.  Gross and chewy like bubblegum.  No flavor in the cheese or the crust.  So, for my $31.00 after tax I got a gross large pepperoni extra cheese pizza, greasy funky fried cheese that tasted like burnt Mrs Pauls fish sticks, 2 cans of lemonade, 1 fountain coke, and....probably was charged for the extra marinara's we tried to dip everything into.  This is not a $31 dollar for two caliber dinner.  I could have went to a real \"sit down\" restaurant and gotten out the door for $30-$40.

Save your money.  Best pizza places in town are Portifinos at the Arboretum, Luisa's near Woodlawn Shopping Center, and Big Guys in Mint Hill (not by the slice though)."}
{"text":"Francesco's is my favorite place to order pizza from in the area. My favorites are chicken Alfredo and broccoli pizza, pepperoni and buffalo chicken pizza. The bruschetta is fresh with high quality balsamic drizzled on top and the best I've had in a restaurant. The staff is always friendly when I call and the delivery driver is super nice. I recommend this place up everyone."}
{"text":"This little place is hidden but it's pretty good. The salads are super fresh and full of flavor, and I've been really impressed with their prices.

The pizza is ok, its a good NY style but lacks some crisp on the bottom. Oftentimes halfway through a lunch slice it's gets soft and soggy.

The staff has always been very friendly and helpful.

The temperature always seems warm when you dine in, probably because of the pizza oven, but it's not bad. We go there several times a month and we recommend it to our friends. Most people don't know about it but it's great.

They are closed on Mondays."}
{"text":"First time eating here and we ordered take out. Pizza was pretty good. A little greasy, but not bad at all. Garlic knots were the best!"}
{"text":"Francesco's is my favorite pizza joint. It's actually the only one in the area we will order from. We always get it delivered and it always looks and tastes great!"}
{"text":"We love there Sicilian pie there wings chicken Parm and garlic knots . I also want to say there service is worth 5 stars"}
