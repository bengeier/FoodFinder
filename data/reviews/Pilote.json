{"text":"I loved this restaurant! My fiance and I found this place thanks to Yelp! (Thanks so much, Yelpers!) I had the rissotto and was blown away. It was perfectly cooked with just enough bite. My partner had a meat dish and loved it, too. And the wine list was fantastic. I had the best Riesling.  It's a beautiful restaurant in a great location in Old Montreal. The service was great even though they were serving a large corporate party upstairs at the same time. This was the best meal we had in all of Montreal and we tried so many. Skip Garde Manger -- Pilote deserves all the accolades and line-ups."}
{"text":"My wife and I had our Anniversary dinner at Pilote while visiting Montreal for a long weekend.  The restaurant is located in historic building in Old Montreal on Rue Notre-me.  The atmosphere, service, food and wine were impeccable.  We had the oysters and squash soup to start.  The soup included a toasted marshmallow which sounded strange but made a delicious combination.  For our entree we both got the bone-in tenderloin which was cooked to perfection and served with the most delicious potato and parsnips.  Neither my wife nor I eat parsnips but the preparation left us wanting more.  For dessert we had a delicious smores dessert and maple gelato.  We thoroughly enjoyed the dinner at Pilote and highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Really beautiful and excellent restaurant.  The maitre d is really nice and knowledgeable about food and wine.  Beautiful and delicious dishes on the menu.  The mint juleps are really good.   If your go in the summer there is a really cool terasse in the back."}
