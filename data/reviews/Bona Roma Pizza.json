{"text":"A bit of a disappointment. We ordered pizza, baked lasagne & pizza fingers with meat sauce. All in almost $50 for this meal. First off the Pizza had almost no sauce and very little flavour. Same for Lasagne very bland with nothing really to say much about. It was 2 star good at best. The meat sauce with pizza fingers was okay but they only give you enough to for 1-2 fingers. Very overpriced for the quality and quantity of the food you get. Even so even if it was half price I would say save your money."}
{"text":"Food OK but over priced.  Service is very strange with the waitress coming across like a robot by continually interrupting and asking questions with robot replies like \"yes sir\" and \"absolutely\" about 10 times each in 20 minutes.  Hope will change for the better, as it has potential."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with this rather small restaurant I had often heard of, but never actually been to. So, when I saw a Groupon come up, I decided to give it a try.
I'm very glad I did - this was a great meal overall and the service was excellent. I placed my order ahead of time for pickup and was rewarded with a $10 coupon towards my next order for doing so. The Caesar Salad was flavorful and not overdressed, the Fettuccine Casanova was interestingly spicy with a great creamy sauce, the Mambo II Pizza (done pan style) was meaty and cheesy, and the Hedgehog ice cream dessert was a great finish. My meal was also packaged with the hot and cold items separate - great attention to detail - and ready right on time. If I had to complain about something, I'd say the pasta was a little overcooked for my taste, but that's a personal preference. 
The location is a little out of my way, but I would definitely go here for a satisfying meal or take-away again anytime!"}
{"text":"The pizza was very good, awesome service. the quaint feel made me feel like I was on a holiday somewhere. it was a nice escape."}
{"text":"Terrible service rude person answers the phone. Offers delivery but not across the street. Most of all, food tastes terrible no flavour and dry. Way too expensive for food I fed my dog and he turned his nose up at. Eat at McDonalds in same parking lot, even though I don't like McDonalds it would of been better than this what Bona  calls food."}
{"text":"A nice little place for either take-out or a quick quiet meal.

The place isn't fancy. Neither is the food. But it is tasty and what you would expect. I've been a couple of times. When you need a quick place to grab a quick bite, and you're in the area, Bona Roma is good place to go. There's nothing to be disappointed about.

Was kind of tossed up on whether to give 3 or 4 stars. Even though this is the type of place I've been to several times and will go to again, and I suppose I can be considered a fan, the food is nothing out of the ordinary. In the right situation, it is certainly the type of place I like to eat at. Nothing pretentious, the food is good, and perfect for those last minute plans. Especially on one of those \"I don't feel like cooking, lets go grab a bite to eat\" sort of nights."}
{"text":"A solid family run italian joint - nothing fancy but always pretty tasty. Pretty much like what it might be like to have an italian grandmother cooking you dinner.  I'm partial to their pizza and calzones but the pasta is also good and generally what my husband gets.   

One of the most awesome things about the pizza is that they have gouda as one of their cheeses and it tastes delicious. Toppings (including extra cheese) are all free on Mondays so that's the best day to create pizza masterpieces that I normally never would have really tried. 

Food ranges from old family recipes to some frozen things (like chicken fingers and mario gelato desserts) and I'd generally stay away from anything they don't make fresh. 

Service is good, even when it's hopping busy with deliveries and take out. 

Overall it's worth checking out or ordering in."}
{"text":"Nice crust with the toppings piled high and a nice amount of cheese.   The place is a bit of a hole in the wall with only a few tables but they have take out and delivery.  I picked up the pizza so they gave me a free 8\" which was nice."}
{"text":"Bona Roma is fantastic. My SO and I were late to the party and went for the first time just this week. Let me be clear: it doesn't look like much inside or out. It is a small little storefront that offers some awesome tasting pizza. On Mondays pizza is unlimited toppings, which is a great deal. I had the Mushroom, Mushroom with peppers, onions, and extra cheese. I really loved it. Anyways, we plan on being back soon!"}
{"text":"Since I live in the central SW, I'd never been to Bona Roma before. I had been at COP late this afternoon (doing the luge! Highly recommended, although I think the season is over for this year) and the group went to this restaurant afterwards.

I'd been told it was small, but didn't realize it was THIS small. There are 28 seats in the restaurant. It's really quaint and cozy, though. Doesn't get too loud or insane. Lots of people coming in for takeout as well.

A downside is that our group of 11 had to split up between 3 tables that were nowhere near one another. They didn't take reservations so we're lucky we all managed to get seats as it was, as all the other tables were taken besides 3 when we got there.

However, the food is very good. I'm not a lover of pasta or pizza, but I had the BBQ Chicken Neopolitan Pizza and it was excellent (I ate every piece and I generally have trouble finishing the last 1/3 of personal pizzas). The other people at my table had a calzone and the Rocky pizza and both really enjoyed their meals. From the sounds of it, there were no complaints. And, the price is right.

All in all, not sure I'd make the trip here too often since it's so far, and because I'm not an Italian food fan, but for those who are in the area and love pasta/pizza, I could see this being a regular haunt."}
{"text":"Great food (& great prices!) An awesome family-owned/ local restaurant. Their pizza is AMAZING. We had their vegetarian pizza and geek salad. Fantastico! Dining in is a little tight as place isn't big but it is a great place for takeout. Great service."}
