{"text":"Enjoyed Nee House immensely. No service issues, just fantastic chinese food. Food order? Spicy Green Beans = Perfect!, Chow Fun (Chicken) = Perfect!   Just a great place. Perhaps my expectations were set by all the bad service reviews, but I was not disappointed."}
{"text":"Warning for vegetarians/vegans: They are unwilling to make any of their dishes without animal products except for a plate of steamed vegetables."}
{"text":"My family loves this restaurant. We all have varied tastes and enjoy exploring the entire menu. My favorite is eggplant and shrimp with schezuan sauce. The staff is friendly and efficient, much better than the current restaurant trend of smothering attention.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Delicious Chinese food!  Not typical take out...this is the type of place I expected to only exist in Mesa or Chandler, but thankfully its further up north.  We ordered the black bean sauce chicken and house special chow fun noodles.  They were both amazing and we will be ordering from here regularly. Plus, the name is hilarious..."}
{"text":"I'm hesitant to review Nee House because I pretty much just don't want anyone else to know about it, but this place is the best for Chinese food in the Valley and that alone is something every decent citizen deserves to know.  Yes, the service isn't the greatest, but some advice to diners going out expecting a thorough, smiley staff: Don't go to a Chinese restaurant.  It's all about the food here and that is why Nee House gets 5 stars in my book.  Bear with me as I leave the actual ordering of food to the real pros in my family, but there is a handful of dishes that are musts.  The Westlake Soup is a great, clean way to start off the meal and makes you feel good about yourself before indulging in the greasy amazingness that follows. As far as meat goes, the HK Style/Peking/Sweet & Sour Pork Ribs are deliciously sauced and have the right amount of meaty bite to go with it.  The Peking Duck is a go-to, as well. Tender pieces of duck with crispy skin served with hoison sauce, green onions, shrimp chips and slightly-sweet, soft buns (ohhh yeah) to wrap it all up in.  I'm a big fan of their Crispy, House-Fried Noodles served with a plethora of meats, seafood and bok choy. They make a pretty good steamed fish (it's served whole, with a head- so don't freak out) if you're being health conscious. It's served in a brothy, soy-saucey, gingery, scallionish sauce and is clean and simple.  And lastly, if you are to eat ONE thing here, maybe even one last thing for your entire lifetime, let it be the Kowloon Style Crab..unless you're allergic to shellfish or something. It's a whole crab, served fried and covered in a ton of crispy garlic and jalapenos. The crab shell has a little layer of deep-fried goodness and I can eat the garlic straight up alone or on top of plain rice.  Yep, it's that good, and yep, I'm that disgusting.  If you're a fan of the basic sweet and sour chicken...fried rice...egg rolls...etc. etc., I'm sure that stuff is good here, but I dare you to venture out of the boring and try some more authentic dishes.  The best way to dine here is to come with a big group and get a lot of different things to try, authentically Family Style!  And if you don't like it, then whatever, I hear there's another Chinese restaurant down the street that serves up crappy basics that might be more to your liking."}
{"text":"What do you want?  Nee House is a real Chinese hole in the wall.  I am from L.A. and that is the only place you want to find.  You don't go to Nee House for a warm and friendly feel...you go for fresh, delicious Chinese food.  Jerry Sienfeld would agree...if they had marble rye I would be running down the street too."}
{"text":"Very authentic Cantonese food and I'm happy to finally find a place that does Hong Kong style Chow mein properly."}
{"text":"This is a very good Chinese Restaurant. Secret, call ahead and see if they have live fish that day. My wife loves the black bean fish, says its to die for.  I really like their walnut shrimp. When you see a \"lot\" of natives at the camp, you know it has to be good food in the kettle."}
{"text":"The best Chinese food in northern Phoenix, and maybe in the entire metro area.  Heck, my wife and I have sampled the Chinese cultural district as well, and in our opinion, the Nee House betters all restaurants there as well.    The Nee House has the best General Tso's chicken in the region, with a little twist (I think it's ginger, but i'm not certain) that sets it apart form its competition.  The General Tso's rivals its competition from the west coast and east coast.  The noodles are fantastic, with fresh ingredients and vegetables, and the eggplant and salt-n-pepper shrimp are outstanding.  The only reason i didn't give The Nee House 5 stars (and I admit, I'm being picky) is because they do not have a dish I've been looking for in the entire Phoenix metro-area, but admittedly the Nee House does not  focus on Sichuan-style dishes (the dish i'm looking for is Sichuan Spicy Cold Chicken Noodles, which i fell in love with while living in the Bay area, but which is impossible to find in the Phoenix-metro area).  If you want authentic, delicious, Chinese food, make sure you give the Nee House a try."}
{"text":"My sister and I have gone here a few times, she likes it, I think the food is bland and BORING.  The service is NON-Existent and rude.  Tonight, Sunday before New Years we went and the place was like an ICE BOX.  I asked the waiter to please turn the AC off.  It was only 66 degrees on their thermometer and the a/c was still on.  It is December and it was raining. He did nothing.  I asked the waitress, she said \"nothing I can do\".. my sister then asked Jade who owns it, and RUDE doesn't even begin to tell you. She couldn't have cared less.  I WILL NEVER GO BACK.  Tasteless food, rude personnel and dining in a walk in Freezer is the worst experience all the way around.  AND I used the ladies room,,, FILTHY.  You could see where they had sloped some water on the floor in the center but the from 6 \" away from the wall to the wall, FILTH.  NO thanks, how they keep their license beats me, how they keep anyone coming back is even a bigger mystery, it sure isn't the service or the food, must be the only place to get Chinese in the neighborhood.  Plus they claim to be Cantonese, there hasn't been a real Cantonese restaurant in Phoenix since Toys Shangri La on 16th and Camelback closed years ago.  This place, Nee House, is a very bad excuse for a restaurant.  Stay away if you are smart."}
{"text":"This was our go-to for Chinese and while the service was always pretty bad, we ignored it because we liked the food. This evening, I went with my kids and one of the dishes we ordered was sweet and sour chicken. Over half of the plate was non-edible chicken- the crispy hard deep fried chunks of batter. When I brought this to the attention of our server, she brought over the owner. When I repeated my complaint to the owner, not only did she not apologize or offer to have in remade, she yelled at me and told me that I had already eaten half of it, so too bad and stormed off and kept shooting me dirty looks from across the restaurant. The couple at the next table overheard our conversation and were openly shocked. Moreover, when the server came over to clear the table, she apologized. The owner came over and yelled at her and she winced with fear. Totally not a good situation there. WILL NOT go back..."}
{"text":"Waited for 10 minutes plus in entry as staff passed by...no smiles, no\"we'll be right with you\", no acknowledgement whatsoever! Nothing friendly about this place! Appeared to be very clean, but beyond that observation, can't say more. Finally approached a waitress and asked if they were too busy on this particular night and she was very verbally nasty...will not go back...pity, as we really had gone out of our way to try this place. Would prefer to rate 0 stars."}
{"text":"Want to eat in Chinatown?   Well, you're in luck, Nee house is a little  Chinatown eatery situated in North Phoenix.   I was a bit suprised to find a place like this next to an Ace hardware in a strip mall, but as luck would have it I walked in and was impressed.  Their menu is some Americanized Chinese fare but hidden in there are some very Chinese dishes harking from Cantonese and Schezuan roots.  The also offer some northern dishes like Peking duck (a must have in Oakland's Chinatown).   I would absolutely eat here again.  I hope this little gem stays in business to service my Peking duck cravings for many years to come."}
{"text":"I was looking for a good Chinese restaurant near my house and saw that this place had great reviews on Yelp.  My husband and I decided to stop here for dinner tonight and I'm so glad we did.  What a little gem this place is!  Its a small restaurant in a strip mall, but the food more than compensated for the ambiance.  We tried their General Tso's Chicken, Mongolian Beef and garlic Szechuan green beans.  The spicy chicken was so tender, and had a nice light batter on it.  The beef was even more tender, if that's even possible.  We loved the green beans too, and enjoyed the sauce which was a nice combination of spice and sweet garlic.  We got there before 6pm and the tables filled up pretty quickly after we got there.  They do an amazing job on takeout orders too, as I noticed there was a steady stream of people heading out the door with their bagged up food.  I'll definitely be back, and see some takeout food in my future too!"}
{"text":"This is a good chinese restaurant in the North phoenix area simply because there is just not too many of them in this side of town ...   I grew up eating authentic cantonese food, and this place is a OK. For a quick fix of cantonese food, it's a good stop in the area but in comparison to restaurants in the east valley or say Super Dragon ... it still needs to bring a notch up"}
{"text":"A recent lunch at Nee House changed my whole opinion of this restaurant.  The crab and dried scallop fried rice was as good as the best fried rice I've eaten while living in Hong Kong. The rice kernels were perfectly al dente, not greasy, well-seasoned with the right restraint and the breath of the wok shined through deliciously.  Fried rice and noodles shows the real skill of a chef - it requires good control of heat and timing.   We also had the lobster with house special sauce. The lobster was plucked live from the tanks and weighed 2.75 lbs ($15/lb) so totaled approx. $40. The sauce was addictively spicy with sliced jalapenos and ample ground black pepper with the crunch of green onion tops - a little less sugar in the sauce would have made it perfect.  Young pea leaves are one of my favorite vegetables and usually available only at restaurants that see a lot of traffic from Chinese customers who appreciate them. They require some plucking to remove the less tender tendrils so tend to cost more. At Nee House, it cost $13.50 per plate. This is on the high side but I cannot resist the flavor and texture of the small tender dark green leaves so have to order it wherever it's served.  I asked for it to be cooked with garlic. It was cooked to the perfect level (nothing is worse than overcooked vegetables), albeit a bit oily.  The fried rice is more than enough reason to go back to Nee House."}
{"text":"We used to go there as often as we could, the food were great, the service we received was fine.  Until the horror stories I heard from friend and my sister-in-law, and I also witnessed how they spoke (in Chinese) disrespectfully about their Caucasian customers. To be fair, their food are great, but I am not willing to bring my business to a family with an attitude. There is more than one fish in the pond."}
{"text":"I love this Chinese restaurant. Being raised in a Cantonese household, I would claim myself to have quite a high standard for Chinese food as we eat pretty much every variety of Cantonese dieshes.  From the outside you would never guess it's a Chinese restaurant as it doesn't have any Chinese characters on the sign. All too many times, most of the so-called \"Chinese\" restaurants in Phoenix are way too Americanized so I hesitated when I first saw this restaurant. However, I found out about this restaurant from the Phoenix Asian newspapers and decided to give it a shot.  Inside, it's definitely not the best looking restaurant around, but it is a decent setting. One thing you'll notice about this restaurant, which is very much like some of the good LA chinese restaurants is that they highlight their signature dishes on the wall via nice full colored images.  The service was pretty decent and seems like most of the staff there (cook/servers) spoke Cantonese, so at least it makes the restaurant feel more authentic. The service was very fast too, had a nice Hong Kong feel to it.  The menu has the trademark selection of classic Hong Kong Style menu items, easy to read menu with pictures and both English/Chinese writing. Tons of clay pot items, meats, fish, soup, stir fry items. I ordered the walnut shrimp w/ mayo, beef chow fun, Salted Fish with chicken fried rice. Those are usually my favorite dishes to order at any of the restaurants to test their culinary skills. For people who know a little about Cantonese cooking, the importance of the WOK determines if the food is good or not. Usually if the restaurant has a powerful enough stove with a good quality wok, you can tell the difference in the taste of the food.  When I got the items, I was very pleasantly surprised by the quality of it. The food was seasoned just right, not too salty. The Walnut Shrimp was pretty decent size, the sauce was not too thick and not too sweet, just right. You can taste the freshness of the shrimp as it had that nice texture to it.  The beef chow fun was a pretty good dish. Beef could've been a bit more \"fluffy\", but still pretty moist compared other places in Phoenix. It was a pretty generous amount. The seasoning on the noodle and beef was a little light for my taste, but still pretty good as the noodles were not too soft and not too tough.  The salted fish rice was a very big plate. The salted fish was cut just small enough and the shreds of chicken was perfect compliment to the dish. This was among my favorite dish.  Back to the WOK thing, you can tell this place had some really good WOK action cause all the food came out real hot, and the texture of the food had all of the fresh \"STIR FRY\" element to it that you can't get from a regular pan.   I've been back many times and definitely very satisfied. I'd probably caution any folks reading this review is that it is still not at the level of Hong Kong or LA, etc, but for Phoenix, it outperforms its competition by a long shot."}
{"text":"Terrible service. The wait staff has real attitude problem. Mongolian beef was chewy.  Moo shu pork plain additional charge for more wrappers!!! Overpriced...for what you get! Go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"The food is decent, but the customer service is AWFUL! For the third time in a row we got home with our take-out order to discover part of our order is missing.  We ordered moo-shu pork and both the crepes and plum sauce were missing.  I contacted the restaurant and they were unwilling to credit our card for that entree, no apology.  I argued with the owner that we can not eat moo shu without the crepes and her response was, \"well then drive back and get them.\"  Why would I continue to give money to a restaurant that provides terrible customer service?  This is the LAST time I will order from them."}
{"text":"Pretty dang authentic, for Phoenix.  Try the eggplant, even if you don't normally like eggplant. Or order the spicy bean curd. Yummy and very traditional. And the noodles- any of the noodles are good."}
{"text":"Very good Chinese food, in various regional styles, in a space that probably hasn't seen a paintbrush in 10 years. The prices were quite good. The live seafood tanks convinced me that we hadn't made a mistake. We were a party of 4 and all had something different, which we shared. The soup was tasty, the orange beef was outstanding, the roast duck deelicious, and the clams in a garlic and ginger sauce was exceptional. We smartly ordered only 3 dishes, because the portions were large. The service was brusk but pleasant.  We'll definitely go back again."}
{"text":"After opening all our gifts and eating a big Christmas lunch the family decided they wanted some dinner.  Well, we didn't have much left in the way of leftovers, and since we were at my mom's, there wasn't much to chose from otherwise in the fridge (she is a minimalist when it comes to food).  My dad had been having a hankering for some fried rice for the past few weeks, which worked out since it seems the only restaurants that are open on Christmas are Chinese!  Nee House is near my folks, so we called up and placed an order to go.  We were told that it would be 45 minutes to an hour until it was ready...yikes!  My dad and my sister left to go pick it up after about 40 minutes.....and they were gone for a really, really long time!  I guess the place was a madhouse, and if you wanted a table you had to wait in a line for a table!  They sat at the bar and waited...and finally after sitting there about 45 minutes they finally got the food (note to self: never try to order Chinese food on Christmas again!).  When they got home we were all hoping that the food would make up for the wait....and well, it did!  We got the hot & sour soup as well as the War Wonton, both were excellent, although the hot & sour could have used a bit more heat.  The house fried rice was awesome, cooked perfectly, with lots of meat and it wasn't greasy at all, which is very unusual for fried rice.  We also got mu shu pork (this was the best I have ever had) and some sesame chicken.  It was breaded, but it wasn't greasy at all, and the sauce was just sweet enough, but not overpowering.  We had ordered some crab puffs, and they were good, but they had forgotten to give us the dipping sauce, which would have made them that much better.  Overall, except for the long wait, we found Nee house to be really good.  My dad brought home a menu for us to look at, and it has one of the most expansive menus I have ever seen at a Chinese restaurant, including a lot of seafood dishes.  My dad was happy to have gotten his fried rice fix...and I have a feeling he will be going back again soon."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Chinese restaurants in the Phoenix valley, have been to Nee House for a few years now and the food has been consistently delicious. Always come here to fill up the little homesickness. Took a few different groups of friends over and no one has disappointed. Some of our most ordered dishes are French styled beef, garlic crabs and stir-fried A vegetables. Of course there are many other good ones, just be a bit adventurous and give it a try :-)"}
{"text":"This place has the best Chinese food I've had in Phoenix ~ I've searched for 2 1/2 years and tonight was delighted - at last - dang I was happy (a LOT of bad Chinese food in the Valley - YUCK and that this isn't BAD - means it's good -sad right?) So the food was dynamite times ten.  The décor, those big A___ fish in the tank look healthy enough - fairly clean - in a strip mall - whatever - Domino's is nearly next door if you are in a carry out frenzy.  But at over 50 years young, and a trained Chef - I never expected to be treated like CRAP no not CARP - and well frankly I was. This was the FIRST time I have EVER stiffed (no tip) EVER!!!!!!  Felt bizarre - but in a way it was liberating - I have tipped 20% for the WORST service in the country  (it's just part of who I am working in hospitality since I was about 17 y.o)....I was treated very well early on - told my menu choice is enjoyed by many, told how to 'manage' it as I'd never ordered this beef tenderloin in a lettuce cup.  ALL was appreciated.  Tips on making a side sauce, how to use the lettuce, how to eat the best 'bite' ~ and I LOVE using my hands to eat, create little bites - so I chose a wonderfully compatible entrée.  All was well.  The wine glasses were small and not filled generously but whatever.  'House Chardonnay' was drinkable - but down it fast - it's not a sipping wine to enjoy and savor.  Okay so I told my waitress that I'd like to order carryout near the start of my experience here.  She agreed to leave the menu with me so I could do just that at the end of my meal.  When dinner was over (yes I all but licked my plate clean - not a grain of rice left)... I was ready at last ... decided I would order either some kind of vegetable chop suey - or a vegetable dish - as I had juicy scallops at home and thought an easy meal for Sunday would be seared scallops with Chinese Vegetables (I know on Cinco de Mayo right?).  My waitress wasn't around and I got this other woman - abrupt, curt and totally not like my original waitress who was basically civil/maybe slightly warm even.  I asked her, \"I would like to know if I could order a vegetable dish that is pretty much all stir fried bean sprouts - perhaps some bok choy or spinach tossed in - but primarily bean sprouts in a light sauce\" - I guess that was interpreted as \"idiot woman\".  She says no we have nothing like that.  So I went on - well how about vegetable chop suey - but 'heavy on the bean sprouts'?    She was annoyed...Bok Choy is tough, sprouts are tender you really don't want that she pontificates & ends with 'you want meat or only vegetables'  I said I WANT VEGETABLES - IN A CARRYOUT DISH with a LOT of FREAKING bean sprouts - call it what you want - and how you want - but can you or can you not do this?  She says NO - it's bad very bad - bean sprouts are way too watery to order like that.  I say, \"miss I don't really much mind eating the food that I choose to order - if I like bean sprouts - I like them & know them intimately - and I'd like to order a vegetable dish with a LOT of them - as in MOSTLY bean sprouts - think spaghetti - and you can save all the expensive vegetables for another customer.  She says, \"Okay but I have to charge you 2 dollars more\". By that time I was ready to go back to the kitchen myself and wok my veggies for home use the next day - but as it was my first time here decided against it and just said - FINE - JUST FLIPPING FINE ~ CHARGE ALL YOU WANT.  I have a hard time believing cooking staff can crank out fresh food on a Saturday night - all night - and suddenly get 'stumped and stupid' not able to wok bean sprouts - and for all the \"less\" effort charge me EXTRA.  I told her, \"I am a cook/chef, you have great food here and I'm impressed.  However if I tell you I want something - and you have it - the reason I cannot order it should be because management won't allow it - not because YOU feel I will be disappointed in my choice.  Am I clear to you on that?  I want to cook tomorrow using my chosen carry out dish ~ Hmmm... quick review, *a vegetable dish that has a large percentage/portion of bean sprouts* - at your $2.00 more pricing for being so wild and rebellious I guess.  I was super ticked off - at this woman telling me what I should or should not order because somehow she telepathically knew what would work for me and what wouldn't - ?  So I sit and wait for 'whatever' and am getting angrier and angrier... Say YES or Say NO - but please DO NOT TELL me what I ordered will taste like crap ~ stupid, stupid and again very stupid thing to do.  I so was having fun and wanting to finally find a home in delicious Chinese Cuisine - this was better than at our little mini China Town Cultural Center by the airport by far.  So finally the carryout food came ~ and I wrote a note on my bill, my phone number and STIFFED the waitstaff and felt GOOD about it - The second waitress was BAD & mean-acting & gruff - pukey. I order this all the time - 1st time punished for it"}
{"text":"After reading Seftels review of Née House a few months ago, I added it to the list. And after reading some of the reviews on Yelp I expected great food with minimal service.   We dined there this past Monday night and were blown away. Exceptional food with great, pleasant service. The wait for the food to begin was a short one. Sure, the place itself is not decorated to excess, but it was clean, neat and relatively quiet.   We enjoyed the......  - House Special Lobster. Sweet, tasty and a lot of it.  - Kowloon style crab. Out of this world! Highly recommended.  - Shrimp with Lobster Sauce. Ok, let down after the above two dishes but the shrimp was very tasty. Poured it over the white rice.  - Shrimp Fried Rice. Yum, yum, yum.    Don't let the chance of getting a server who isn't Ms. Charming scare anyone away from this place. They could abuse me all they want as long as they keep that food coming."}
{"text":"Been coming to this place, even by a different name for 20+ years, it has gone steadily down, but tonight was the last time I will ever go there! We kept going there because we can always get in, never busy, it never clicked even to me a person that eats out most the time! It was dead as ever, I decided take out \"J\" was as selfish as ever, and with a $30 take our order, would only give me ONE, mustard, they were open for another hour, but would not even sell me one, not just give me... And when I got home! It was not even my order, and We would not even eat it!      Go go China, will work or uber anywhere but here!"}
{"text":"This review is based on takeout only.  This is probably the first place in two years where I've had decent Chinese food in Arizona.  We had two dishes, mu shu pork and curry chicken.  Although I didn't want the curry chicken, I was afraid to order a chicken that would be breaded or fried.  I was pleasantly surprised by both.  Hopefully next time I can actually get some chicken that is Chinese instead of Thai.  The mu shu was great.  The flavor was good, not too greasy.  All in all, a good experience."}
{"text":"Fresh and authentic Chinese food. We especially love their seafood dishes. They also make the best hot and sour soup I've ever had. It's perfect for whatever ails you!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for good, authentic chinese food then this place is one of my favorites in Phoenix.  If you're more into westernized chinese food, go to Panda Express.  If you're looking for an upscale place or are more interested in great service, then this place isn't for you.   It is a typical home-style authentic chinese restaurant, and one of the best ones for authentic chinese food in Phoenix.  It has been here for a few years and we order here regularly.  The ownership has been the same since they took over the location from Yummy China (which was a pretty bad place) and the food has been consistently good.  As others here mentioned, order from the chinese menu, not the western menu.  We've tried pretty much  the entire menu and haven't found too much that we don't like.  The cook sometimes comes out and chats with you - he will make you something specific or special if you ask for it.  They do seafood (lobster, crab, shrimps) really well; their house chow mein (dry style) is HK authentic; their beef chow fun and chicken and salt fish fried rice are some of our favorite dishes. Price-wise, it's reasonable for the quality.  The place is fairly clean for a chinese restaurant.  Service wise - well, it's a chinese restaurant - 'nuff said.  If the service will bother you, order take-out instead.     Silver Dragon used to be our go-to restaurant for authentic chinese food until it closed down.  This place is better, so we don't miss Silver Dragon."}
{"text":"Inattentive waitresses with attitude. Ick. The sizzling rice soup was delish but everything else was just fine. I mean, it's Chinese food. There's bad chinese food and decent chinese food... but hard to really make anything excellent. Not any more \"authentic\" than anywhere else, but that said we stuck with americanized dishes like chicken w/ veggies and chow mein. They definitely have more options for more authentic stuff like shark's fin soup and abalone though if you're feeling adventurous. But regardless, I doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good for basic Chinese, and take out is a great option if you live close.  They're usually busy, but take-out is quick and easy.  Only real complaint here is how unfriendly, and even \"rude\" they can be on the phone.  Seriously?  Could you NOT just hang up once you have the order, please?  A simple greeting and/or thank you for your order would be appreciated."}
{"text":"Can only reiterate the love/hate relationship with this restaurant.  The food is actually authentic and tasty, however, the service is downright appalling.  I concur that the staff is utterly disrespectful and rude!  Yes, they are ALWAYS talking about the customers.  Its angering and have mentioned it to them - they do not care.  I NEVER eat there anymore, but rather order to go on RARE occasions now.   I think only reviews like these posted on this site will make a difference, hopefully, but given the several experiences with most all people here, it will uni]likely change for these people and this business...unfortunately."}
{"text":"We've recently been doing a lot of take out from Nee House on a BIG scale - think dinner for 10. Two new favs: the hot pot full of stewed beef and big flavor. Turnips and five spice yumminess and the fried tofu with dried scallops which fakes us into eating vegetables and is a unique and delicious dish!  EVERYONE is happier at Nee House these days and the karma is better because of it!"}
{"text":"AMAZING hot and sour soup. I would go here every day if i didn't think the staff would think I'm nuts. They already know my order when i stop by as it is :-)"}
{"text":"Service is despicable. Very rude and impatient servers. Inflexible to dietary requests and accommodations. Wanted to charge us five extra dollars to simply add mushrooms to an entree. I will not be returning to this pathetic excuse of a restaurant."}
{"text":"Moving here from San Francisco where Chinese food was as common as seeing women in Scottsdale wear shorts with Uggs, I found this place to be as good as it gets for Chinese food in the Valley.  As I read most of the comments for this restaurant or any other restaurant in general, people love to rant about how this was bad, or the service was horrible.....there was one that mentioned the food had a specific temperature when it came out. Unbelievable how people can tell how hot or cold the food is to a specific degree! I LOVE that some mouths come with a thermometer!!!  What if I stuck my....nevermind!!  As of now, Nee House keeps me content when I am craving Chinese food and missing San Francisco.    Everyone is trying the \"american version\" of Chinese food.    Being a foodie......a few things to learn about Chinese restaurants.  1.  There really isn't anything as orange chicken, or pineapple chicken, etc...You ain't gonna find none of this shit in Asia! Try Panda Express if you want good orange chicken! 2.  Chinese restaurants will not have the service you will find at a 3 Michelin rated restaurant unless you're dining at Tommy Toy's in San Francisco.  The attitude and rudeness comes with the territory.  Anyone ever go for soul food?  Same attitude, what's the difference?? Tough it up, bitches!  Besides, the food tastes better with attitude. 3. Reality check.....WE LIVE IN PHOENIX!!!!  You want Chinese food, this is it!  Nee House......try:  *Beef Chow Fun.....as good as it gets in Hong Kong, NY, SF, or any major city with a Chinatown. *A-Vegetable......spicy, this dish's origin is from Taiwan. Very seasonal. I was surprised they have this dish year round here.  You can't even find that in the Bay Area year round.   * Fried Pork spareribs in salt-spicy.....a bit greasy, but pretty authentic."}
{"text":"I am from  Vancouver via Seattle. We know chinese. Very few good ones in the valley. This one is OK . We will go again."}
{"text":"*+*+*+*+*+*+* We were expecting a rude wait staff  *+*+*+*+*+*+*+ I felt cheated as many reviewers comment on the rudeness thing .... didn't happen in our case.  We had lunch on our visit  ...... each having one of their luncheon specials. There are two price points on the luncheon menu ...... either $7.99 or $8.99 Each luncheon special consist of soup, spring roll and entrée.  The food was very good ..... Thank goodness that the sauces Didn't all taste the same. That in itself is a real plus ...... when it comes to a Chinese meal.  Wait staff attentiveness was something else ..... its like you don't exist after your meal arrives.  Enjoyable meal ....... will return in the future."}
{"text":"Live ants crawled from the rice bowl delivered to our table.  They offered us nothing, not even an apology.  All they did was squish the ants against the table cloth and bring out a new rice bowl.  Won't be coming back to this restaurant ever."}
{"text":"Terrible. Pot stickers were so overcooked, they crunched like raw pasta. Very obviously frozen previously. Gross. If you're ordering the pineapple chicken, be prepared to sift through lots of huge chunks of ginger. I enjoy very spicy foods, and understand ginger for flavor, but chunks that look just like the pineapple? So unbelievably bitter. Would not refund. I was really looking forward to this place, given the previous reviews. Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"3.5 actually. Went to Nee House finally as it's a much easier drive than other Cantonese joints we frequent either in the west valley, Mesa or Chandler and being that I was in a lobster kind of mood we ventured there to try their best. We ordered the black bean version as our family typically orders the vanilla ginger and scallions so it turned out to be a good change up although I'm not a huge fan of the overwhelming volume of black pepper and onion condiment it's stir fried with (fortunately that's not included in the $/pound calculation. Tonite's market value was $15.99/lb.   Warning all lobsters start at 2 or 2.5lbs so for two its easily either your main and only protein dish or a good take home portion for leftovers. However due to seafood restrictions at work a problemo for me to bring as tomr's bento filler out of courtesy to my colleagues. Lobster was succulent and cooked to a good tender texture as some places over cook it to a rubbery disaster. I thought the seasoning could've been more heavier on the black bean as the garlic  overpowered the dish as well as the abundance of bell peppers.  Other sides we went for were hubby's fave eggplant and garlic sauce along with stir fried peashoots which is a staple in dining out Cantonese menus. Average taste and not disappointing and also not a bad location for us going forward as we'd like to try other faves like crispy egg noodle stir frys as well as the hot pots.  They do get much take out traffic but for any seafood always eat at the table and fresh!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in the area. Seriously, the food is a lot better than the price and location would suggest."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant several times. It is so unusual that despite them having seeing us on many occasions, they always act as if they have never seen us before. The servers are cold ,impersonal and seem a bit sarcastic. I never leave the restaurant with a good feeling that I have been treated well and courteously. So why do we go? The food is undoubtedly fresh and I have seen some of my foodie physician friends over there ..enjoying the food. Also it is relatively close to home and affordable ( except when it comes to crustaceans). The Ambience sucks, but then again, that keeps the overheads and prices low.  I asked my son why he keeps going there. He replied.. \"Dad ,the food must be good if people go back again and again after being treated like crap\"!"}
{"text":"Great Chinese food. We have found it to be much better for takeout, but sit-in dining was fine as well."}
{"text":"Great service and good Mongolian beef lunch special w soup and egg roll only $8 plus good hot tea for $1. Very pleased w left overs for later."}
{"text":"Very good Chinese food. Everything is very well done, and their fish dishes stand out. I would highly recommend the rock cod with black bean sauce, ma po tofu, and the rock cod with vegetables."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!  I'd recommend everyone take management's advice and try your entree with the chef's hair...it truly is something you won't get anywhere else (we'll...you'll get it here and there, but mgmt probably won't promote it).    If you are slightly adventurous like me, order the clay pot with beef stew and turnip.  When I got mine, there was a hair on one of the turnips in the stew (I'm definitely one of the lucky ones...don't be jealous Lana Del Rey!).  No big deal, i get that it happens...so I wait until my waitress checks on us and point out the hair.  The waitress then picks up the pot for a close inspection and acknowledges that it is truly human hair (good thing she did, since my vision at age 34 is deteriorating quickly).  She then holds the pot, looks at me, and asks what I would like her to do (she is young..i'm guessing in her early 20's, speaks English fluently, probably grew up in Phoenix and is part of the restaurant owner's family, at least to my understanding).  Since she is new to this culture of 'eating out at a restaurant', I advise her that my preference is for the kitchen to re-make me the dish.  The waitress gives me a stunned look (since I am asking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow) and tells me that the hair is only on one turnip.  She then puts the clay pot back on the table, and provides me her advice.  She (and Confucius) says that I should simply remove the turnip with the hair from the stew and continue eating the dish.  (Whoop, there is it!).    My first reaction was that this was crazy, but then I realized... the human hair was actually being used as an ingredient in giving flavor to the stew/broth.  Although not meant to be eaten, it was one of the magical ingredients that made the food at Nee House special.  No wonder the waitress looked at me like I was a leprechaun (and not the lucky charms type, more like the scary 90's movie version...you know the one they did so many sequels of)!  Well, it is May, but Happy St. Patty's Day, and go check out Nee House!  It is a dining experience you won't forget.    Tip: Keep your fingers crossed you get the early 20's female waitress (I think she's the only one in that age group working as a waitress there).  She will make sure you get the royal treatment."}
{"text":"We have had dinner in and carried out and they are by far the rudest people either way. There are several other Chinese restaurants very close that have better food and treat you with at least respect. The lady standing at the front of nee house who processes pick up orders needs to be in a line of business where she never has to deal with people! She's a walking talking nightmare!!"}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant because we heard it was the best in town. Very disappointed. The food is flavorless. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"THE BEST Chinese in Scottsdale and Phoenix!!! Cold jellyfish salad, anything with crab, and the sharkfin soup are all 5 star dishes. If you're lucky they'll have the abalone available, its amazing.  The atmosphere is dry and boring, the service is distant and cold, but this about food and the food only. Go!!!"}
{"text":"Have been going for years, definitely a downturn in quality last 2 years. Kids have even noticed.  Just got our order of .shrimp fried rice and there were 2 shrimp . Manager or whoever said it's impossible but I'm counting! Oh well avoiding at all cost ! Too many choices in the city."}
{"text":"Me and my roommates have been coming to this place for over a year. We usually enjoy the food but have never really enjoyed the service. Usually when we have eaten here we get it to go because the service is poor.  This time I drove nearly 20 minutes to come pick up the food, I picked it up I brought it home and we started eating. Then a fly was discovered in one of the dishes. We called and said we were going to want a refund the lady we spoke to was not going to give us a refund unless we brought the food in. I didn't mind that but she was argumentative over the phone. I packed up the food, and drove all the way back and brought it into the store. I walked in, and I was quiet, she came up to me and said \"let me see\" she took the bag I had and just started walking towards the back. Then she went into the kitchen, I could hear her talking but since I do not speak Chinese I did not know what she was saying. She then came out and the first thing out of her mouth was, \"You ate a lot of the food so I am not going to give you all your money back\". I said, I had no problem with that but I do have a problem with the attitude you are giving me. I said, \"I understand things like this happen but you have not been courteous to us at all\".  She gave us half of our money back in cash. She said people try to fake things like this all the time. I said I know, I use to work in a restaurant, I know how people try to scam things. I told her thank you and walked out.   I understand them wanting to see the food and making sure we were not lying but there was never one time she said I'm sorry for the inconvenience or anything like that. Not even sorry there was a little insect in your dinner.  This really sucks because no matter how good the food usually is, the rudeness and dis-respectfulness will keep me from coming back.... Ever."}
{"text":"Better than average food.  The pork egg rolls were delicious, and the tea was very good.  My green pepper chicken was a bit on the cool side, and needed some more seasoning / salt.  The staff was nice, but seemed a bit confused, Three different people took our orders and served us.  Besides that Its a great place to go in a pinch, we did get served fast and the prices weren't bad."}
{"text":"Ehhh pretty good food. They have some real chinese dishes that other places don't really serve. Kind of pricey though. Staff is also not pleasant. Feels like you should sit down, eat and leave in 20 mins cause of how dull everyone there is. Oh well not expecting to see waiters using crumbers at places like this. Will keep going back and hope they warm up to me"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late lunch. When I walked in around 2:15 pm there was no one in sight, neither a fellow customer or staff. After a few moments a nice lady came out from the back and instructed me to take a seat. It appeared they were getting ready to sit down for either a late lunch or early family dinner. Many of tables had linen on them, with the remainder still uncovered from lunch. The place was very clean and simple, nothing awe inspiring, but I wasn't here for the decor but the food.   And the food was outstanding! I've eaten Chinese all over this country, especially in NY and Chicago. Unfortunately the Chinese food in Phoenix has been very disappointing so far. But today was about to end all of the negative experiences I've had so far. Ordered spicy shrimp and eggplant with fried rice, egg roll and hot and sour soup from the lunch menu.   My food arrived hot! The egg roll was crispy and very tasty. My hot and sour soup was good but nothing I haven't had before. But when my lunch plate arrived it was a feast for my eyes. The food was hot from the wok, seriously hot. The fried rice was the best I've ever had. A short grained rice that was not greasy but entente. The eggplant was to die for. Sweet, tender and flavorful in a dark sauce surrounded by a bountiful amount of wonderful shrimp. I savored each and every bite. I was so happy the food was hot as it forced me to eat slowly and savor each and every bite. I actually went home and dreamed about this meal, wanting to return the next day and have it again. I litterally ate every last grain of rice off of my plate. Heck I wanted to pick it up and lick it, it was that good.   I definitely can't wait to go back for either lunch or dinner and try more of there great food. And by the way, after reading about the grumpy family I didn't find them unpleasant at all, in fact they were very nice."}
{"text":"Had dinner here tonight and was underwhelmed by spotty service, unappealing ambience, and hit and miss food. I think the best part of the meal was the fried rice with shrimp and BBQ pork. I am still puzzled why so many people rave about the walnut shrimp. It is covered in a mayonnaise sauce that takes away any crispiness that should have been there. The garlic chicken was pretty decent, but the sweet and sour fish my dad ordered was sub par. The sauce was good but it seemed to be missing the fish. It was more like fried breading. They also feature Kirin and Kirin Light  beer on the menu, but don't ask for it. They don't actually have it in house. This place is not worth a repeat visit."}
{"text":"I have been going to Nee House for about 10 years.  Coming from the SF Bay Area, I thought I'd have to do without good Chinese food, but Nee House is (almost) as good as the real deal in SF.  I'm currently trying to work through the menu since I almost always get the same dish!  My recent find was the Rock Cod in Black Bean Sauce and XO Scallops.  These were so good that they are now the dishes that I must deny myself to continue my journey through the menu.  I wish I had started exploring earlier.  In case you want to know, my old favorite dish was the seafood with crispy noodles.  Oh, now I'm craving that one!  darn, looks like Nee House tonight!"}
{"text":"I have a love and hate relationship with this place.  The food is usually great and delicious, but the service is horrible.  The waiter's and hostess are borderline rude and talk negatively about their customers.  I know, cause I'm Chinese and can fully understand what they are saying.  The owner is usually waiting tables and has a horrible attitude.  What can I say though, their food is probably the best around the area.  I'm done dining in there cause I can't stand their rudeness.  I usually just get the food to go.  You ever see the episode in Seinfeld where Elaine goes into a nail parlor and suspects the ladies are talking about her?  It's exactly what its like at this place."}
{"text":"Walked in first before two other couples came in the door. Apparently they were regulars because when the hostess arrived she knew them by name and greeted them. After telling her we came in first she ignored us anyway and sat the regulars. After we finally got sat we never saw a single soul. She sat us, went back over to the regulars to chat, then dissapeared. We watched as everyone else got their order taken. We were ignored and waited about 20 minutes before getting up and leaving. I'll never go back again because of that. Sorry Nee House. We wanted to like you!"}
{"text":"By far one of the best (and there aren't many in Phoenix) Chinese restaurants in the Valley. I have eaten in Philly's, San Fran's and Boston's Chinatowns and this it good stuff! They have \"real\" Chinese food there too if you care to try it."}
{"text":"Another visit to our favorite Chinese restaurant! I had the house special chow mein. It was a little dry and not as much flavor as usual! Roberta had her usual lemon fish.... Not up to par! The Breading was dry and hard and NOT ENOUGH lemon sauce! She asked for more sauce.. But they REFUSED to give her any more sauce??!!  Maybe they have a new chef... But this was a disappointing evening!!! ."}
{"text":"Egg-cellent chicken fried rice! Only down side is that my boyfriend said the food smelled bad and made fun of me the rest of the night and I was sad. If you don't have a jerk boyfriend who is allergic to Asian I would highly recommmend going here."}
{"text":"Decent place for legit Chinese food with the usual fast service and decent prices. We were able to enjoy roasted duck, crispy pan fried noodles and honey walnut shrimp. All winners we thoroughly devoured. It's location is convenient and parking is readily available. Seating is plentiful so there was no wait when we arrived. Overall, a good find we'll probably go back to when we're in the mood for real Chinese din din."}
{"text":"I love this place, everything i have has been good and fresh tasting.  The salt and pepper shrimp is my favorite."}
{"text":"Tried some more traditional fare at book club.  The jellyfish salad, chicken, crab, and dumplings were all delish-- crab and chicken were a little work but worth it.  We had it take-out and it was really good."}
{"text":"We were just there last night around 7pm for dinner, Dec 25th 2012. It was a bit of a confusion with getting on the waiting list since no staff was at the front counter for the longest time even with tons of folks standing around, but eventually things got sorted out.  I am from Southern CA, Chinese, and am extremely impressed about the food!   Wait staff (owners daughter and an middle age lady) was extremely friendly, even under the madhouse pace of trying their best to serve everyone. I would go here every time i am in PHX.  There might be a wait, but the staff and food is excellent."}
{"text":"I feel like I'm in an abusive relationship with Nee House. They treat me like shit but I keep coming back for more because their authentic dishes make me love them long time (inappropriate? Eh). I mean, it's never a shock when I come in and the staff makes me feel as if I just dropped into their home without calling first, but today they really turned me off with their rudeness.  I go in at about 2:45pm with my daughter for lunch. There is only one table being used. The woman points to the table right next to the only people eating at the restaurant. So, I smile but went one table over and sat down. The woman comes out of the kitchen and says \"no, can you sit at that table over there?\" I looked at her as if questioning why I couldn't sit at the table I had chosen, and she pointed to one of the large, family-style tables right next to the table I had chosen, and said \"they're going to have dinner\". I moved, but was very perplexed as to what the issue was. Aren't all the tables there for a reason? And who eats dinner at 3 in the afternoon? Anyway, I shook it off and ordered the shrimp and eggplant in Szechuan sauce; it was amazing, as usual. My daughter enjoyed her chicken lo mein. What I didn't love is how the waitress brought out one dish way before the other, and never acknowledged our numerous friendly \"thank you's\". She just had this energy that yelled \"this is the last thing I want to be doing right now. Why are you here?!\"  Then....the staff starts coming out of the kitchen to that table that I wasn't allowed to sit near. THAT'S why I couldn't sit there?! I guess I am a second-class citizen that cannot sit at my preferred table if it is too close to the staff as they eat their food. Totally turned me off. Ridiculous. And for those who claim \"it's about the food, not the service\", that is ridiculous too. When you eat out, the way you are treated as well as how delicious the food is contributes to your experience as a whole. Is the food good? Absolutely. Does this mean that it's a good experience? Probably not.   I vowed to never go back....at least until I get another craving for that shrimp dish-- with a side of jerk sauce."}
{"text":"Tried their lunch menu that ranged between $8.50- $9.50.  Had the shredded pork with hot garlic sauce  after they couldn't deliver the walnut shrimp without sugar.  The mayonnaise sauce had sugar in it.  She said it wouldn't taste like much if I didn't have the mayonnaise sauce.  OK. Then shredded pork  it is.   The lunch comes with soup (egg drop or hot and sour), a spring roll, white rice (or egg fried rice).  Had the egg drop soup which was delicious.  Probably the best I have had in the valley.  Some places put so much corn starch that it is more like a pudding--not here.  The salt level was perfect as well.  None of the noodles usually served with soups here.  Maybe they think it is not authentic. The spring roll was light, flavorful and not greasy.  I didn't care for the egg fried rice as it was too plain.    The shredded pork with hot garlic sauce was a good portion, tasted OK,  but they didn't spice it up the way I asked.  Instead they put a small container of red oil that had hot pepper flakes in it so I could add that to my food to make it spicy.  Really,  you want me to add this oily, greasy stuff to my food?  How is it that other restaurants can spice it up by adding hot peppers without a problem?  The menu indicates that it is a spicy dish but it was not.  I ate most of it but took the rest home because the portion was very decent for $8.50.    I couldn't get my eyes off the table next to us with an attractive, young asian couple eating what appeared to be fabulous dishes.  They were all eating and no talk.  I think that is an asian thing.  When they eat, they eat.  But it might be because it was so delicious.  They had a whole lobster with some scallions and bits of other things.  They also had the salt and pepper pork chops with jalapeños, scallions and salt.  OMG.   That is one of my favorite dishes.  But I thought it was much too big for lunch for me.  They took most of it home because the portions were so large.  I also noticed that the price of the salt and pepper pork chops was $3.00 less than the place I usually get them and the portion was twice as large.  You know where I'm getting them next time!!!! The service was courteous but not quick because I only spotted two servers in the whole restaurant.   This is a simple, unadorned restaurant except for the food posters on the wall.  Not the prettiest of places but we come here for the food, right?  I believe there are some knockout dishes here because we saw several asian couples eating here which makes me believe they have really authentic dishes here.   I will give them a try again.  I am sure you know what I'm going to order!"}
{"text":"One of the best Chinese places in phoenix hands down. Everything came out hot and fresh great sauces and no msg. flavor and consistency was on point everything was amazing we will be back!"}
{"text":"Do you like Chinese food? Do you love delicious Chinese food? If you said yes to one or both questions then Nee House is where you want to be. I think it may have been 2003 or 2004 that i frist started going to Nee House. It seems like it was called some thing eles a couple of years earlier or it was under different ownership. But when we finally decieded to give it a try. We were so happy we did. Nee House became our place to go for yummy chinses food.   Some things i ordered all the time were mustard greens and black mushrooms. Which was Many steamed mustard greens or bok choy with WHOLE black mushrooms in the center with a delicious sauce placed around both. And eggplant w/ spicy garlic sauce. Rock Cod fish fillet with vegetable, fish filet with ginger and green onion. And several other items. The food has and always was delicious.portions were always perfect. We always went in a small group of 3 or 4 friends. And i cant recall ever any of us having a bad dinning experience at Nee House. Im suddenly at a loss because i havent found a chinese restaurant as good as Nee House in my new home. Dreaming of the spot on,  great Chinese food at Nee House. At least i have the wonderful mermories. Which is making me salivate just dreaming about it rite now. :)"}
{"text":"We love Nee House. Great prices, great food, we've never eaten in the restaurant here so not sure on atmosphere but we've never had a bad experience!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Food is awesome, people are great and it's not too pricey!  They serve family style so it's a great place to go with a group and sample a little of everything. We've been going here since they first opened.  At that time it was very basic; their plates and cups didn't even match.  But the food was always great. One thing to keep in mind if your dining in:  They bring each dish as it's ready, so there could be a 5 minute delay between the time  each dish is served, but it's only a problem if your are not sharing dishes. Go there, you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Four of us dined here for the second time on Sunday.  The food was excellent....however, this was our second time experiencing poor service, which we thought was an aberration on our first visit!  All wait staff are exceedingly rude to the point of exasperation!  They are not attentive and act as though they are enduring you!  We had to ask for hot tea repeatedly; after entrees arrived (with a time gap  between each) we had to ask repeatedly for the accompanying rice. Insult ended our experience...when presented with the bill we were asked by two wait staffers to vacate our table...even though no one was waiting for a table and several tables were vacant.  We will definitely NEVER return to this venue!"}
{"text":"I have to agree with many of the reviewers. The food is delicious, but the service STINKS!! The service is not friendly, you feel like you've been accosted when they take your order, and when the food comes out they practically drop it on the table and run for the hills.   On a positive note, the food is very good, we've not yet been disappointed with any of our selections. My two boys are very picky eaters, but they devour the chicken w/veggies, veggie lo mein, and house fried rice."}
{"text":"The most authentic chinese food I have found in the area.  Being chinese , I have been searching for real chinese food and am so glad I tried this place thanks to yelp reviewers.  The rock cod in black bean sauce was very good. They have four tanks of fish/lobster  on their back wall and always have specials- i will have to try the lobster when i come with a bigger group. The service has been fine when I went."}
{"text":"Excellent traditional Chinese food. We ordered fried rice, chow Mein, and egg drop soup. Everything was awesome and we will return!!"}
{"text":"Okay, other Yelpers are not overly impressed with this place, but I'm ecstatic.  Major bonus because we've actually got an \"authentic\" Chinese restaurant in North Phoenix.  The tanks are filled with fresh crustaceans soon to be cooked and devoured.  Caucasians are not a majority when you assess the customer base, and the decor can be called \"clean but dive-ish\".  I love it.  The table cloths used at dinner time seem unnecessary given the rest of the decor.  The portions are plentiful.  The food has lots of flavor.  The chicken with black bean sauce is fantastic and spicy.  The prawns with honey pecans was okay, but a bit too rich.  The prawns are covered with an unusually rich mayonnaise sauce, which although wasn't my favorite, I give them credit for serving something unique.  The chow fun noodles should not be missed.  This is my new favorite Chinese restaurant.  North Phoenix is blessed to have Nee House in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I tried this place a couple years ago after it replaced the last restaurant, and hadn't been back. I looked at the reviews, gave the place the good of the doubt, and tried it again. The food is awful. Some other reviewers mentioned that the americanized food wasn't good, but the 'authentic' chinese food was great. I ordered the shrimp and eggplant in szechwan sauce, as I assumed that may be somewhat authentic. There was no flavor I could point out whatsoever. The eggplant was mushy and bland. The shrimp tasted like garlic and nothing else. I remembered the fried rice from before and it reminded me why it took me years to go back. Take a drive, go to China Chili in Phoenix, get the Sichuan Prawns (notice, they are spelled correctly), and enjoy your food. I ask you to never go to this restaurant.  My name is Stirling Peters."}
{"text":"Perhaps the most authentic Chinese food in the area and I wouldn't have expected it looking from the outside of the restaurant.  Definitely try their shaking cube beef which is super tender and flavorful. We order it every time we go there...you'll thank me later! LOL.  For a splurge, have the chef make you the house special lobster which includes black pepper, butter and large pieces of scallion and leak. Very flavorful compared to the normal ginger/scallion sauce that most places make.  We were so impressed with the food that we took our out of town guests who live in San Francisco over there and they were also pleasantly surprised with the quality and taste of the food.  Prices are reasonable. Service has always been pleasant.  I notice they get a lot of take out orders.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"We ate here 6 to 8 times, with my friends after church,  we always occupied 2 big round table. We love the food, it really taste good.  But service  really needs help. Training maybe, and needs more workers. Every time we eat here servers forgot utensils or water or some of our order. I hope the owner address these concerns. Last Sunday we decided to go to Halo-halo restaurant."}
{"text":"Service was shotty, but pretty authentic Chinese food. Worth a shot if you dont mind a small place with one or two staff that like to talk more to each other than the customers."}
{"text":"Frequent diner and take out customer at this restaurant for many years.  Only decent Chinese restaurant in the Northeast Phoenix Area. Come for the food only but beware the service is always horrible from the older Chinese waitress with the glasses. This woman does not know or care about the meaning of customer service and being friendly and attentive.  Always very argumentative when asking for something and condescending to us and in my observation with other customers with a sour face. I recently ordered takeout with value of over $120 and asked for extra gravy on a particular dish. This same waitress taking my phone order said it will cost me $2.00 more. They just received a nice order and now she's being cheap and has the gall to ask for $2 which I declined.  No tip for them. They don't value and appreciate loyal customers. We need more good Chinese restaurants in this part of town to give them competition and teach them not to take customers for granted. If this restaurant was in San Francisco the customers wouldn't take this poor attitude and take their business elsewhere.  Unfortunately with popular Chinese restaurants in general they know people come for the food and don't care one iota about being nice and respectful to the customer since they figure there will be customers still coming."}
{"text":"coming from California (Los Angeles area)....this place is LEGIT.  We go there on the regular."}
{"text":"Love this place. We tried out the food here while we lived in the neighborhood. We now live 25 miles away and still pick up food here a few times a month. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"The first couple of times I went to Nee House I was unimpressed.  We had ordered typical stuff off their American menu, which was okay but nothing to rave about. Then I dined there with a Chinese friend who ordered off their Chinese menu, and my opinion of Nee House did a 180 degree turn.  If you're ready to be a little adventurous, you're in for a taste treat!  I love their steamed fish, which is slathered in a delicate, flavorful broth.  The Kowloon Crab is a garlicky treat, but wear old clothes when you dig into this sticky hands-on goodie or your next stop might have to be the dry cleaners.  Other favorites are the Szechuan Green Beans and Garlic Eggplant."}
{"text":"Pardon my lack of details, but I've been here multiple times over the past couple of years, and I feel the need to write a review!  Everytime I've been here, it's been in groups, and every dinner has been excellent. It's more of the traditional Chinese fare, and it works wonders how everyone orders their own dishes and splits. The food quality has been excellent. Personally, I go for their fried rice and their soups, but everything on the menu is pretty damn good, as far as I can tell.  Prices were decent, and the staff were pretty attentive with refills and such. Then again, I always try to come on the off hours. If you make a reservation in advance, it works wonders!  I think it's one of the most reasonable Chinese food locations in the area, and I've already recommended it to my friends."}
{"text":"Not worth it. Rice was overcooked. Beef for Mongolian dish was warm in the center of plate and room temperature around outsides which means it was most likely microwaved. Also the Mongolian beef dish had little seasoning and was not spicy except for the burnt pepper left in.  The shrimp with hot garlic sauce was not hot taste or temperature wise. Shrimp was rubbery and only lukewarm. Vegetables were overcooked on one plate and undercooked on another. Overall inconsistent and lazy cooking for the price per dish.  It is not worth it. Only decent thing served was Egg drop soup. Also avoid the fish they serve from the aquarium there are live ones swimming but there are also dead ones stewing in the same tank."}
{"text":"Can you have ZERO stars??? The food is actually good.  If you feel like being treated like shit, this is the place for you.  We have been long - time customers until tonight.  They have no respect for their customers.  If looks could kill when you walk thru the door.  Another review said it reminds them of Chinatown in NYC and Boston.  Having grown up in NYC and living in Boston as an adult, this is NOTHING like Chinatown.  In New York they are smart enough to realize that repeat business is where it is at. The cost of new customer acquisition is too high. After getting apps on our table, a suspect hair was noticed on a plate. Ok, let's cut to the chase...it was a pube! When we pointed it out, there was no concern whatsoever. It comes as no surprise that this could happen as the bathroom is filthy and constantly has nothing to wipe your hands with -- I guess tonight they used my plate.  If your dish of choice is \"house special\" anything you are rolling the dice at this place."}
{"text":"Love the food - great selection and the price is right.  One of the best Chinese restaurants around!"}
{"text":"We've been searching for Chinese food on par with our usual delivery joint in LA for years and hadn't found anything (at any price point) that compares...until we tried Nee House this past weekend. The restaurant has no ambiance, but that's not what you're there for -- it's 5 stars because of the food, which is well-seasoned and perfectly cooked, with good quality, fresh ingredients. We took that for granted in LA, because it was so common there, but here Nee House is a stand-out -- it's head-and-shoulders above the drek that passes for Chinese food elsewhere in the Valley."}
{"text":"It's not often I write a scathing review, without any constructive criticism.  This place made me want to walk out the moment I walked in, but my parents suggested it and said it was good. Hey, I have been to \"Hole in the Wall\" type places that had amazing food, so I thought we'd stick it out.  Things went south fast.  3 orders of veggie egg rolls, 6 total, all still frozen in the middle.  My wife and mother pulled dead flies from the bok choy in the Cod dish.  My dad and I agreed the sauce for the garlic eggplant was gross.  The steamed white rice was bad... HOW DO YOU MESS UP STEAMED WHITE RICE?!?!  The shrimp fried rice never arrived (maybe just as well). Never going back. Stay away."}
{"text":"The food from this place reminds me of home. I'm mostly Taiwanese, a little island off of China, but the food here has the taste of Hong Kong with a few American favorites for the locals such as the classic mongolian beef or the citrus-y orange chicken.   I personally go for a mix of both. When I'm feeling more cultural, I'll grab some lobster with garlic, or even some chinese broccoli with oyster sauce (warning, expect this dish to be bitter, that is a valued taste in most Chinese cuisines).  Today, I grabbed some take out of the mongolian beef for myself with fried rice and egg roll, and the girlfriend at home got the chicken lo mein with fried rice and egg roll.  Dude, just the egg roll alone and a few bites out of the entreé and you are FULL. Seriously, their portions are huge.   Expect leftovers and merry moments later in the day to finish your food.  Caveat: Don't expect the service to be very kind. When going to truly authentic Chinese places, do not expect the customer service standards of that of even a TGIF. The Chinese are very \"to the point\" when it comes to food. You go in, sit down, say hello, order some food, pay your bill, get out. Don't make chit chat."}
{"text":"One of the few Chinese restaurants that I'd recommend in Phoenix.  It has proven time and time again to be consistently good.  Its a bit more on the expensive side for Chinese food (but you have to understand that I usually demand cheap good eats), but overall I think the food is worth the slight premium.  Especially since its one of the few restaurants that is actually located in Northeast Phoenix opposed to Chandler or the Westside.    I recommend the French style beef cubes, snow pea leaves, and walnut shrimp.  But really most dishes are delicious.  The decor is not super impressive, but clean.  And the service is a bit lackluster, but the food is what you go for and the food is good.  Happy eating!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food around  We always do takeout but have sat there once and the service was graat"}
{"text":"This simple and unassuming restaurant packs a wallop as real and authentic Chinese food mainly Cantonese and Szechuan with live lobster, tilapia, bass, clam, and Dungeness crab.  The food is tasty and very reasonably priced.  This definitely is not an Americanized Panda Express, PF Chang's, or buffet."}
{"text":"Huge portions but tasted sort of bland unfortunately. We split the family dinner A where we chose the beef broccoli, kung pao chicken, chicken in spicy garlic sauce, and shrimp n vegetables. They all kind of tasted the same. The hot n sour soup was the best of the meal. Super nice staff and pretty clean restaurant."}
{"text":"Black hair in my food from an order I picked up. See picture. When I called to tell them there was a black hair in my food they said I was lying and only saying that because I was mad. I told them to refund my money, and they said I could not prove it was in the box before I left the restaurant.  I will be disputing the charge with my bank and never going back there again."}
{"text":"Wenr to the place for take out on Christmas Eve. Ordered ahead and showed up when they said the food would be ready, 40 minutes. Had to wait another hour to get food. Really? Food wqs nothing special."}
{"text":"Very large menu with Live Crab, and Lobster that you can pick from the nearby tanks if you wish. They have both the typical Americanized dishes and some of the more Authentic Dishes. Nice!  I have tried several of the lunch specials as well as some of the authentic dishes on the fish side of the menu. Lunch portions are very large and a great value. Really liked the Deep Fried Oysters with Black Bean Sauce and a Seafood dish I ordered with Crispy Noodles off the dinner menu. So many choices.  Not bad for this part of town. It is hard to find anything similar around here without driving a great distance. Service is a little more Sour than Sweet depending on who you get. This is fine if you are talking about soup of course. I generally like to let the server order for me based on what they recommend and did not get much help. Would like to see a little more enthusiasm.  Give it a try and see what you think. I will definitely be back again for the lunch specials and then some.  3.5 STARS"}
{"text":"The service was awful.  Only one gal took the orders for the whole place and then other people delivered the meal to the tables.  The Wor  Wonton soup arrived after 50 minutes. It lacked any of the most basics, including flavor!  The moo shoo was OK.  They put the food on the table but never served it properly and put the whole thing together.  And we ordered shrimp with lobster sauce.  It had so much cornstarch, little if any egg and no soy,  Tasteless.  Wouldn't rush back. If they are kind of busy....LEAVE!  The people surrounding us were complaining that they had been there for an hours and still nothing was on their table!  They don't have good management nor enough servers to make for a pleasant dinner.  Go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place out since one of my friend recommended this place to me . So My friend and I Had lunch there yesterday. Ordered eggplant and tou fu is fired and mix vegs with brown sauce .definitely not a Chinese style. we only had couple of bite and left ! The  price was pretty expensive. Two meal runs $22 for lunch."}
{"text":"This place is way under rated!!! Very close to China town style and that's hard to find in the dessert. Service isn't thay down for custom orders but otherwise a real gem!"}
{"text":"I originally saw a few old reviews that made me wonder where they ate...I had a fine dinner last night and the food was excellent...Pineapple chicken outstanding and the egg rolls crispy and tasty.... my companion had Orange chicken that was outstanding as well.. my only advice is to know what you need when the server in at your table as they were difficult to get their attention when I realized I forgot to ask for chop sticks...but enjoyed my meal with a fork... YUMMY!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Waitress took a long time to seat us. Then didn't give us an option on table choice (we didn't want to sit in the doorway), when I asked her to move she told me \"you can sit over there\" in such a rude tone. We decided to leave."}
{"text":"I had lunch at Nee House - for the first time - today.  All I have to say is... Baked Crab Kow-Loon Style! AMAZING!!!  Okay, one more thing, String Beans... DELICIOUS!  Oh, and also, the service was quick and our server was very pleasant and attentive!  Can't wait to visit again!"}
{"text":"I could have made it better myself. It was so generic. The fried rice seemed like days old. The hot and sour soup lacked depth. I would not waste my money again on this place."}
{"text":"Don't bother.  The food? Blander than bland. It doesn't taste like anything. I can't tell you if I like it or not. Here's what I can tell you: it was served at a piping hot 74 degrees. Like eating leftovers that sat on the kitchen table all night. Also, the pork in my hot and sour soup (neither hot nor sour) was really spongy.  The service? Adequate, if a little curt. I know someone who went here, ordered a Shirley Temple, and got a \"You've got to be kidding me\" from the waitress. I only wish I had that kind of story to tell people.  Yeah, don't bother."}
{"text":"Nee House offer excellent Chinese food. They offer live crab and lobster which is the best in class Chinese food from salt& pepper to spicy style. It is nothing wrong with it. However, the waiter service is horrible, they need to improve it."}
{"text":"Very moody yesterday. Full moon? Never pleasant so we go less and less. Take out still good though. Not a fan anymore. The daughter should have never left she was the bright light."}
{"text":"Ordered two House Special Chow Mein meals. This was by far the most bland food I've ever eaten, absolutely no flavor. The chicken, beef and shrimp were also chewy and there were hardly any vegetables. What there was a lot of were the soft noodles..........ooodles of them. A  way over-priced and tasteless meal."}
{"text":"Finding authentic Chinese food in Scottsdale has been quite difficult.  Nee House is the solution to that problem.  Their menu on Yelp is not as extensive as when you get to the restaurant.  When I got to the restaurant and saw their menu, I was amazed by all the choices and could eat here all week and not cover everything I wanted to order."}
{"text":"I was in North Phoenix for a friend's birthday.  This place was choose by one of our mutual friends.  This place is very authentic!!!  The help speaks Cantonese! (and English) and were very helpful in their recommendations.  I would go back if I lived up there."}
{"text":"Had a fairly decent meal on 5/14/16.  Portions were large and tasted okay.  We were finished with our meal and chatting with our friends when asked to leave. We were told that the table was needed.  There were a few people waiting who could have been seated at other available tables at this   early evening.  They were rude, inconsiderate, and just really used poor business sense!  We will think long and hard before we return there and we will make sure to tell our friends and acquaintances. Oh,yes they were certainly not apologetic!"}
{"text":"We gave this place 3 chances to hit a home run and they didn't even swing at the ball! Terrible service, bland food and the place was empty. We asked for a drink and the waitress acted annoyed! We will never go back. I guess we have to travel all the way to Mesa for decent Chinese food.  Too bad."}
{"text":"This is a nostalgia play - if you want to experience Chinese food like you grew up with, Nee House is your spot."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for many years now. It's not my favorite Chinese restaurant but it is still pretty good. We stopped in today for lunch and had the chicken lo mein and the orange chicken. Both specials came with rice, an spring roll, and a cup of soup. With two sodas lunch was $28.00, including the tip. Over the years we have tried many of the items from sweet and sour to garlic egg plant and I don't recall ever having a bad dish. The service is adequate. They are not overly friendly but they get the job done and get you in and out in a timely manner.  The decor is sparse but they do have some cool fish tanks to look at."}
{"text":"Definitely worth trying!  We were very pleasantly surprised.  We finally found our favorite Chinese restaurant in Scottsdale/Phoenix.  We had Long Island iced teas.  They were $5.99   My husband had General s chicken.  He asked for it because it was not on the menu.  It was very crispy and tasty. I had fried pork chops with salt pepper because I had never had that.  Very interesting presentation.  A little salty for my taste but delicious.  Everything is a la carte.   She asked us if we wanted steamed rice which we did.  It is a very busy popular place  there were regulars there.  We will go again soon"}
{"text":"The food is always good, I am only doing 3 stars because of the service. After about 6 different visits, I can honestly say the service is terrible. Most recently we did take out, and well that took 30 waiting in the lobby after the time they said the food would be ready to actually get the food. When we have sat down, the service is pretty slow and seems to take quite a while to get our food! The food is great and the portions are a good size, but wow, bring your patience!! I hope they read the reviews about their service and step it up!"}
{"text":"the food was delicious but the restaurant seemed dirty.... I had to return my wine glass because it was dirty...... hmmmmmmm but tasty"}
{"text":"I really want to like this place.  As a transplant from Southern CA, I've found it nearly impossible to find quality Chinese....or Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese food in the Phoenix area.  So many fusion spots, and other imposters posing as the real thing....and Cantonese restaurants seem to be going extinct in Phoenix. I can often gauge the quality of the Chinese restaurant just by looking at the menu.  Nee House caught my attention when I saw hot pots, mapo tofu, clams in black bean sauce, and chow fun.  All good signs and nice to see something other than orange chicken, sweet and sour pork and the omnipresent pupu platter and egg rolls.   The food here is actually decent.  It's not San Gabriel Valley good, but it will do.  It's the service here that gets me.  Believe me, I'm not a service snob and I usually could care less, especially at a Chinese restaurant where service is never to be expected.  These people are borderline rude and seem to have a vendetta against their customers.  It's really weird. I've learned that you need to have your head on a swivel and practically force eye contact to make things happen...then you may have some success.  My kids have even renamed these place as \"Superslow Chinese Restaurant\" if that gives you any indication. With that said, we have learned to manage expectations and deal with accordingly, like you would any problem employee, and proceed with caution.  The food is good though....enjoy."}
{"text":"From the moment we sat down the waitress appeared put out by us. Food was incredibly overpriced for such mediocre quality seafood. Overall a disappointing American Chinese dining experience. Recommend you give this place a miss."}
{"text":"My family and I were regular customers at this restaurant for 5 years, my family and I usually orders ginger scallion crab, lobster, seafood crispy noodles and Singapore rice noodles.  Time and time goes by, I noticed their customer services are bad, the owner daughter, son and their mom.  The son usual sits at the corner playing his phone and careless for customer service, the daughter always have a black face and throw a fit when we request for something, and their mom, I ordered Take out, sweet and sour Pork chop, bakchoy with black mushroom, and assorted seafood soup, I asked for some white peppers and some red vinegar in a container,  she walks around to service other customers as she walks back, I ask for it again, she went to get red vinegar but she didn't get white peppers,  so I asked for it then she told me, white peppers  are right over there, help yourself,  I went and try to get some white peppers,  there were no container there, as she walk away, she mumbles,  you think you're a king or something,  everything need to get for you.  This is an unnecessary call and it is a very poor customer service.   I told one of the staff there, to help me get a to go container,  I helped myself for some white peppers and i told the staff, I am not going to come back anymore and so are my family,  we will not return for their poor customer services.  Last thing, the sweet and sour porchop were over fried, not good at all, very disappointed at this restaurant.  Will never come back."}
{"text":"We eat here on a regular basis.  It's like that little hole in the wall place that has tasty food for reasonable prices here!  I can't vouch for their full menu... we always get the chicken in spicy garlic sauce... that's it.  They have lunch specials that come with a spring roll and fried or white rice... its delicious... love it.  White meat chicken and lots of veggies.  By hole in the wall I don't mean it in a bad way... these are the places that have the best food a lot of times.  Place always looks decently clean... if decently is even a word... but I love my dish... I would suggest it to anyone."}
{"text":"The lady owner of this restaurant was rude and condescending, I don't know how they stayed in business? As far as customer service goes, they do not know the meanings of it.  As far as for quality of food, it's ok, I used to be a regular customer due to the fact that I don't want to make the drive down to Chandler for good Chinese food, but not anymore."}
{"text":"3.5 *s.  Had west lake beef soup (pretty good), beef chow fun (#1 daughter rated it pretty low.  Beef was cut too big and irregular and pretty bland.  Lacked seasoning.  By comparison, my daughter said jade palace's Americanized-bastion-of-north-Scottsdale-Chinese beef chow fun was better), rock codfish in black bean sauce.  Pretty tasty sauce and fish wasn't bad but it didn't seem like cod to me.  Not sure what it was.  Small portion of rice to accompany.  Pricing not bad.  +\- on returning."}
{"text":"We have gone to this restaurant for a couple of years and it has almost always been good. The service is awful, border lining on rude so we switched to take out only. Today we brought home our $50 order and discovered a fly in it. When I called I was told that refunds were not issued only credit on your next order for just that item. Once the fly was found in our food, everyone lost their appetite. I won't dine there again since they refused to issue a full refund and were extremely argumentative over the phone. We even brought home the order back to them to show them the fly. Very poor business management"}
{"text":"Wow I was very impressed when I first tasted their food. They have amazing dishes, ranging from the simple orange chicken to their turnip deef hot pot. If your a fan of any style Chinese food, this place will hit the cravings"}
{"text":"This is my default restaurant for Chinese.  Ingredients are always fresh and never overcooked.  They will bring out the dishes as they are done rather than having some sit while cooking the others.  Personally, I like this approach. When I go with my son we always get the squid with black bean sauce.  Yum."}
{"text":"Our office just moved here from the Bay Area and my collegues and I have been on a mad search for a GOOD/GREAT Chinese restaurant.  Difficult to find . . . until NOW!!  Nee House has high quality, fresh ingredients and offers EXCELLENT FLAVORS!!  Certainly on par with many Bay Area Chinatown restaurants!  And yes, the staff is a touch surly  but that's a true indication that this is the authentic thing!!!  Of course they're going to be surly, it's a chinese restaurant!!!    Excellent food!  Can't wait to try the next treat!!  Tell all your friends!  We need to keep this place open!!"}
{"text":"Awesome Chinese food. Everything was great. The sweet and sour chicken was fresh. The hot and sour soup was hot and sour. One of the beat Chinese food spots in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I don't give a damn how good or bad the food is, poor customer service is a deal breaker for me. I'll never go back to this place where they don't even care that you're spending your money they help them out."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best Asian food in town. Their sliced beef with oyster sauce is the most tender and tasty that I have ever tasted and their cashew chicken is outstanding. We have never had a bad meal and we have been going there for years. Great local family run restaurant that is always a pleasure to go to. My entire family lights up when I tell them that we are going to Nee House for dinner. Thank You Tony"}
{"text":"Best authentic Cantonese food in the entire AZ. We drive from south Chandler (50 miles) once a month to enjoy the food."}
{"text":"We do take out with them and always get a pretty big order - which they have never gotten wrong!  We love their orange chicken, lemon chicken, chow-mein and veggie fried rice (you can get it with out egg if you're vegan!). The negative is that it is pretty greasy and we wish it wasn't. We weren't super impressed with their Mongolian beef so we don't order that anymore."}
{"text":"STAY AWAY!!!!!  Service was terrible.  Ordered lobster, no utensils. Who ever said this is the best Chinese restaurant ought to have their head examined."}
{"text":"This is the worst Asian restaurant ever been, food was terrible, service was bad and had a hard time communicating with the waitress... take my advise or find it for yourself"}
{"text":"I stopped by for lunch today around 12:30, craving some type of eggplant dish. Finally around 1pm, someone comes and takes my order, I ordered the shrimp and eggplant in schezwan sauce, with the egg flower soup. The soup tasted like boiled water with a scrambled egg. The shrimp and eggplant dish I ordered had only a couple of pieces of shrimp and lots of eggplant, the sauce was flavorless."}
{"text":"This is the 4th time I have been here, everything has been consistently excellent ! Live seafood from the tank ( lobsters, crabs).Their service is attentive and  food is served pretty fast. Of course, thumbs up for authentic Cantonese cooking!  The closest real Chinese place to my house, so I will be coming back whenever  I don't feel like driving to chandler or Mesa."}
{"text":"We were looking for an authentic Chinese place and were excited to try this place, especially because good Asian places are scarce in Scottsdale. Unfortunately the food tasted like one of your run-of-the-mill Americanized Chinese food, and honestly Panda Express or Pei Wei's food is more flavorful. Service was great still, and it is fair for takeout."}
{"text":"Short Story- Very Rough Gem                   - Above average Chinese Food - Americanized                    - Specialty might be Cantonese Style Seafood + Live Seafood                   - Service is efficient but not warm or friendly                   - Appears a little tired or run down but scores \"A\" with Health Inspection  Long Story-  Once seated I saw the tanks of live seafood and saw a sign for sea bass that I was interested in. The waitress told me that they are all out of sea bass and haven't had it for at least three days....This was not a deal breaker for me but my husband got offended by the way she said it like I should have known they were out of sea bass. She said today they have tilapia. I'm not a big fan of tilapia so I ordered off the menu.  I got the rock cod with vegetables. The Fish was prepared to perfection and was very moist and clean tasting. The sauce was very thin, light and velvety with essence of chicken and was laced with ginger and garlic. This would have been a perfect dish if the bok choy was cleaned properly. I also note the paddle in my rice bowl appeared dirty but when doing a closer inspection I realized the paddle is stained not dirty. This can be easily fixed by using bleach.  My husband had the Szechwan Pork. He thought it was very above average. The pork was moist. The dish was spicy and wasn't too sweet like the way Americanized Chinese Szechwan is. It wasn't the same as the way The Szechwan Restaurant Mui's used to make it but still this dish was very good.  The Yelp rating is very accurate here.  I'm also feeling a 3.5 based on service, atmosphere and averaging food in.  I will round up my rating to 4 stars because the food is what this thing is about."}
{"text":"My wife, family & I have eaten at Nee House for more than a decade.  The food ranges from good to very good, depending upon who's cooking.  The service is another matter altogether.  Regulars know NOT to expect the servers to accommodate their customers with any regularity.  If you want clarification on a menu item, be sure to take your Chinese/English dictionary.  If you want to substitute an item, learn the art of oral argument. If you need more water or tea, get used to waiting.  If they change a dish from the menu, you'll find out when it is served.  If they decide to clean the fish tank while you're eating,  good luck digesting your good,  Get the picture?  Over the years, we've put up with a lot but today, one of the younger waitresses was particularly rude & insulting even though we've known her for years.  I suggested that we leave but my wife insisted we stay and focus on the food and not the horrible service.  So if you go, please heed our warning and expect little to no service.  Or consider another Chinese restaurant, as we shall do from this day forward...    George & Son has exceptional service and great food.   Maybe they can give lessons in civility and customer service to Nee House...."}
{"text":"One of the top Chinese restaurants in AZ, they will serve you a Peking Duck at any time with no notice! Excellent lunch menu with a few dozen options to choose from, they specialize in hot and spicy foods but will make anything for you with no heat by request. They serve excellent fish dishes, including lobster and crab which is killed and cooked to order. Other seafood offered includes abalone, sea cucumber, squid, clams, oysters, cod, shrimp, scallops. Average dish runs about $9-$13, a whole Peking Duck is under $30. Love both the Wor Wonton and the Hot & Sour Soup, really the only weak item on the menu is the ribs appetizer which has too much sugary sauce and is pricey for the amount of ribs given. Love their Shredded Pork Schezuan Style, Baked Pork Chop With Salt & Pepper, Braised String Beans and Sizzling Plate Steak With Black Pepper (very unique, well worth trying!). They will make you Shrimp With Lobster Sauce with either brown or white sauce. Can't recommend this place highly enough even if you have to drive an hour to get there!"}
{"text":"Went there with some friends. Our Chinese friend ordered from the Chinese menu but the American menu with the pictures also looks good. She didn't know about the Chinese menu (I told her!), she always orders from the American menu and was quite satisfied. The inside looks clean, not really your regular looking Chinese restaurant.  Service is a bit slow like some people remarked. They could be a little bit more \"friendly\". Food was very good, very hot. I will go back at lunch or with some family.   My Chinese friend said it was very popular with Chinese people, we went on a saturday night at 5pm, it wasn't completely full but by the time we left, customers were showing up."}
{"text":"My previous review has the real details about what i LOVE about their food!  Update:  Doing mostly take-out here, but at least one of the grumpy girls is more friendly now!  Yesterday when I grabbed our to-go order, she smiled, made small conversation, and did not exude a sullen disposition in any way.  I'm happy for me, I'm happy for her!  Ordered many of our usual items, plus Mongolian beef, which was very tasty. I'm stil partial to the Ginger beef, however."}
{"text":"Not quite sure it lives up to all of the accolades it receives from the local press but then again I only stayed on the westernized side of the menu.  I will wade deeper into the more authentic dishes on my next visit.  Having said that the portions are super generous for the price point and familiar Chinese dishes are up to par."}
{"text":"Wow! As a first generation Chinese American, may I tip my straw hat off to this place. I was with my family for dinner and it was just like they make at home! (but some dishes were better... shhh don't tell) It's authentic to a specific region and tastes absolutely delicious!  Crystal Shrimp Chinese mushrooms and mixed vegetables Spicy pork chops Roasted duck Chicken corn soup Westlake soup Sauteed fish with tofu and veggies  And hats off to whoever makes the Tea decisions there... some of the finest jasmine green tea around! :)"}
{"text":"My friend and I ordered the lunch special chicken lomain noodles. Later we both had upset stomachs and felt horrible. We have ignored the unfriendly employees but now we can't trust the food. WE WON'T GO BACK!"}
{"text":"Absolutely hands down, my most favorite Chinese restaurant in the world. Well, in the USA that I have been to. The squid and leeks in black bean sauce, the fried oysters in xoxo sauce, the crab kalhoon style, and several other dishes are so good. the Hot and sour soup is done perfectly and served at a perfect temperature. Their egg drop soup is also very very good.   It is authentic Chinese food and they have several fresh seafood options coming directly from several tanks right in front of you. Great prices, and one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix area altogether. Recently moved from Phoenix to Oakland area of California. Wish I could have brought my Nee House."}
{"text":"My family loves Nee House.  I think my dad would move in there if it was possible.  Funny enough, when we first went there he didn't like it because of their service.  He didn't understand the serving style when it comes to \"family style\" and one dish at a time.  Once he tasted the food, it was all over and he was a fan.  My whole family just loves this place.  My sisters insist on going here when they are in town.  Some of the favorites are:  Sweet and Sour Chicken, Orange Chicken. Walnut Chicken. Kung Pao Beef, Fried Rice, Salt and Pepper Shrimp...and the list goes on.    Now, this is not the most ideal date spot because ambiance isn't important to this family owned restaurant.  Most of the staff speak English as their second language but certainly understand what you want.  This is a family owned restaurant with the dad in the kitchen all the time.  Their daughters work hard as servers and can really make your dining experience more enjoyable if you engage them in conversation.  We eat there so much they recognize us and could probably place our order without us saying a word.  Their prices are reasonable.  The food is tasty.  Overall, A+."}
{"text":"Stars and taste are personal. I've liked places others rated low and disliked some that others rated highly. When we walked in, every table was filled. This place was clean, the tile floors were clean (not sticky nor slippery), we were served immediately and to food was tasty, hot and fresh.  The Szechuan beans had just the right spice and crunch. The fish and baby bok Choy had just the right amount of salt and the veggies were perfectly al dente. The ginger and onion  lobster was fresh and had the perfect spring back in each bite. And the Peking ribs were cooked well with plenty of yummy sauce.  At the end, my mother told the waitress to tell the cook that the food was delicious. This place gets 5 stars because the food and service were both very good, prices were decent and it's a place we would come back to, recommend, and even bring out of town friends"}
{"text":"Nee House  Coming from San Francisco living now in Phoenix I quickly discovered one of the big trade-offs in my move to the desert from what I regard as the best restaurant town in the country, if not the world - along with NYC of course. After all , there are more ethnic Chinese per capita living in San Francisco than anywhere in the world except Hong Kong. And I enjoy Cantonese as opposed to the other styles like Hunan or Mandarin.   Having lived in San Francisco for much of my life and having spent time in Chinese I can spot authenticity pretty easily. The menu I saw online along with whatever pictures I get review helped me in my decision to check it out.   My verdict: Pretty good but it's not in the same league as San Francisco: I rate it 7/10. The Wor Wonton Soup was good, though it was lacking the typical veggies and shrimp I come to expect Yes, there were wontons but no veggies of any substance I can recall, and beef, which is typically NOT srved in this soup. But it was tasty.    Mt friend and I shared the spicy/salty squid which was actually QUITE good and would recommend. We also had the snow pea leaves as a main veggie dish and while overpriced,  was excellent. We also shared  chicken pan fried noddles which were just \"okay.\" Skimpy on veggies and chicken, taste was a 6/10 though the noodles were fried perfectly.   Would I recommend? I suppose,  but with the expectation that if you are looking for a great, authentic cantonese style restaurant similar to what you might get in San Francisco, Oakland or much of Los Angeles or Vancouver. Will I return? Probably."}
{"text":"This 2 star rating is for the service. Although we were waited on promptly and the food came out in a timely manner, the waitress was extremely rude.  We were visiting with family after we had paid for our meal when she came over and told us people were waiting for a table.  She wasn't even pleasant about it. It had only been a few minutes since we had paid.  I have never been asked to leave a table.  Although we were happy with our meals I don't think I could ever go back, that kind of treatment is unacceptable."}
{"text":"We decided to branch out from our usual Chinese take-out, Mr. Cook's. That was a mistake. We ordered the pork egg rolls, the crab rangoon, chicken pan fried noodles, salt & pepper squid and beef with oyster sauce. The good: my husband loved the squid. The bad: everything else. I ended up using the rice to eat my leftovers from somewhere else.  The first misstep was the egg rolls. They were the oddest egg rolls I have ever eaten. The pork tasted like some type of processed pork you'd get in a grocery store deli. The crab rangoon were overly fishy and soggy. The chicken and beef were velveted to the point that they both almost tasted mushy. The worst part is that this all added up to $56 and will be going in the trash."}
{"text":"I never thought of Nee House as a steak house but I only go for lunch. Maybe the menu  is different for dinner.  At lunch I compare it to other chinese places and  to me it is superior food. I have never had anything I did not like. I have been going there a long time.  Prices are comparable. The service could be friendlier but I let that go since the quality of food is so good."}
{"text":"Hands-down best Chinese in the area. We eat here at least once a week and are always pleased with the cuisine."}
{"text":"One of the few Chinese places I actually like to eat at.  The portions are not the most generous, but they are prepared with thought and care.  It's not the prettiest place, (but what chinese place really is).  It is clean and airy.  Best if you can go with a large group of friends and split a big meal. As usual it is in a strip mall, but overall, great food in a so so location."}
{"text":"I knew I should have ordered something from the large fish tank that was located in the dining room. But I didn't want to get all sloppy digging in the Lobster and Crab. So I opted for the regular menu. A big mistake. Chow mein fried rice sweet and sour chicken were all just ok.  Nice place with good service. May return for that Lobster."}
{"text":"If this place were only closer - mmmmm. Good service, very Hong Kong in its scant decor and very fresh food.   I am still full from last night.   Thank You"}
{"text":"Good Chinese food is hard to find in PHX.  I finally found a place worth going to and proud to call myself Chinese again!  Nee House is a little hidden restaurant among a strip mall of nothingness.  Thankfully, somebody recommended this place to me.  At first sight I was hesitant.  Our waitress was a lovely woman whom sure knew how to sell and flatter the guest J.  The place reminded me of any good Chinese restaurants back in LA YUM!  Décor wasn't much to be wow'd but I didn't expect much.  Okay back to the food; you gotta order from the Chinese menu; not to say the \"Gwy-lo\" menu is not good.  Soup for your appetizers is a must mmmm.  Funny, I wouldn't know what the dish I order is called in plan English; I sure knew how to order it in Chinese haha!  Sorry friends if you're curious: I suggest you go and try it - definitely worth your travel.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My mom loves this restaurant ! Good food ! Big portion for its price! My favorite is BBQ duck and Peking duck is my next item to try!  Good service!!! 5 stars for this guy!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here on and off for the last fifteen years since they used to be under dirrerent names. Some years I won't go for a year, another year, I would come a few times a week where the owner used to tell me \"see you tomorrow\"....  I came here for lunch the other day this week and I was looking through the diner menu (as I always order only from dinner menu even during lunch time) as I came earlier than my friend.  I realized I ate everything on the menu. So am I a fan here? I must be.   I like to come here with a group of people as I like to order as many dishes as possible.  I normally start with soup. Seafood soup is my favorite.  My favorite main dish includes rock cod with black bean sauce,  mapo tofu, green vegetables I can't remember the name but they know what I mean (they have pictures on the menu), singapore noodle, to name a few.  For dinner, I would like to ask them to cook fish (the whole fish), lobsters, and if we make reservation two weeks in advance, I would like to order Shaoxing wine (???). They don't normally keep a bottle but when we requested, they orddered bottles for us.  Warm shaoxing shu with sliced ginger goes well with the food they serve...  They also have special menu during Chinese New Years, as well as just sometimes. I learned how to say and read lot of dishes name in Chinese from this restaurant.    Service may be on and off but quuality of food is always consistent. The most authentic Chinese food in North Phoenix.  How could I say that? Because I had Chinese food in China."}
{"text":"I actually think this place is pretty decent - at least when I've eaten here. It's realllllllllly clean, and the hot pots are goooooood.   My mom and I dined here for lunch once, and it's a pretty good deal for the lunch plates - the spicy eggplant is really good.  Ate a family meal here too... it was a standard Chinese family meal - soup, veggies, a few meat dishes. It wasn't terrible or gross, nor was it HALLELUJAH! worthy. It was just good.  What was annoying was how this one family decided to let their little brats run amok and ignore their screaming and running into people/chairs/tables."}
{"text":"War wonton soup was really good. Mixed seafood platter is a really light dish with white sauce, the seafood was cooked really well so it wasn't too chewy. Overall happy dinner."}
{"text":"I was very dissatisfied with Nee House My wife ordered chicken pan fried noodles last week for take out and was charged $13.02.  This week I ordered the exact same thing but asked for the sauce on the side. They charged me $16.28, My wife called them thinking maybe there was an error,  The owner informed her that there was a $2 charge for having the sauce on the side. We we're charged $3.26 more not $2. To top things off all you get is sauce, chicken, bean sprouts and onions. Needless to say, we will not be going back. Unfortunately, we we're regulars at Silver Dragon but they closed down. The only reason we ordered from Nee House was because of it's close proximity to our residence. We'll be sure to take our business elsewhere."}
{"text":"This was by far the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant in my entire life. I wish I could say I am exaggerating, but this really topped every bad experience I've ever had in the past. The entire experience was bad, from beginning to end. We came in for a Thanksgiving meal, and the hour we endured ruined the entire holiday.  The service here was beyond terrible. We were 1 of 3 tables being served, so it wasn't busy at all - but we were treated like they had a full house and a line of people waiting out the door.   It all began when we weren't greeted. The woman hurriedly walked up to us and looked at us as if we came in to ask a question. I said \"two please,\" and she replied \"two what?\" I repeated myself \"Two, for here, please.\" And then the fun began....  It took us about 10 minutes to even be acknowledged by the waiter/owner. When we asked for a coke and diet coke, he angrily took our teacups away and returned with our sodas about 10 minutes later. I'm not sure what we did to tick him off, but he sure was upset that we came in.  When we inquired about the price of crab, he told us \"Ummmm, ummmmmmmmm, $45.00. Some are bigger some are smaller,\" and very quickly walked away, said something to the lady working there and walked in the back. Finally he came back and took our order. We ordered in Chinese, he confirmed it in English.  The food certainly didn't take long to arrive - so much so that the paper wrapped chicken was still partially raw in the center, and the peppered beef was uncooked halfway through. The dishes themselves were presentable, but very, very small and pricey for a typical Chinese joint. We never complained about the raw food. The owner added an additional dish about 5 minutes after we began to eat. He became very upset with us when we told them we didn't order it and asked him to take it back. We weren't rude about the mistake with the additional dish, but he quickly got an attitude with us and began to argue with us about the dish and wanted us to take responsibility for it.   He refused to serve us the for remainder of the meal and had the other lady working there give us our check. We certainly won't be returning, and I hope that anyone else who braves this establishment has a better experience than we did."}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese food in the Valley.  I have seen many posts about the service, but I know the Owners and they are great, warm people when you get to know them.  The service style is very much in-line with their traditional Chinese culture.  Food is always top-notch. I like Egg flower soup - the salt & pepper crusted crab is amazing.  Fresh seafood, great fried rice!  Love The Nee!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and prices the sweet and sour chicken is amazing and the Kung Lao chicken is great"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in the area. Their dishes are always very consistent, fresh and authentic. Our family will return here again and again, but we almost exclusively order takeout. Our favorites include pineaple chicken, mu shu chicken, black bean anything (shrimp or chicken), pan fried noodles.. the list goes on. I highly recommend the Nee House! But I would suggest ordering takeout, their service isn't great at all."}
{"text":"Before seating yourself, check to see how busy they are inside.  If the dining room is even close to full...  leave and come back another time.  We've eaten there several times because our kids dig it.  If you're there say... on a Friday night at about 7PM, forgetaboutit.  The staff is usually rude but the food is good.    If they are busy, the staff is still rude but the food might be delivered cold.  There's gotta be a better place than this."}
{"text":"I'm so glad I found this place close to my workplace!! Love the spicy pork chop and salted fish and chicken fried rice. This place is just pricey!"}
{"text":"The short: Delicious, authentic food in generous portions; polite, quick, and attentive service; clean and well-lit generic ambience.   The long: We decided to go here because we'd heard the food was great, but after reading reviews about poor service during the drive up, I almost changed my mind. I'm so glad I didn't! While the service wasn't that overbearing \"fake-friendly\" you see at a lot of places, the three servers who worked our table were just fine.   Located in a plain, well-weathered shopping center on the northeast corner of Tatum and Thunderbird, the place really isn't much to look at. It's clean, and during our early dinner, light streamed in through the windows.   We ordered the Pu Pu Platter, Eggplant with Garlic Sauce, Rock Cod Fish Fillet with Vegetable, and Honey Walnut Shrimp, and everything came out reasonably quickly, with plenty of time to enjoy our appetizer. While we enjoyed everything, the Pu Pu Platter was our least favorite. The Hibachi's flame was a little out of control, which was hilarious, but we set the skewers on fire when we tried to char our skewered beef. The fried shrimp, egg rolls, crab Rangoon, and BBQ pork were nothing special, but the paper wrapped chicken (wrapped in foil) was a nice change as well as the most authentic thing on the platter.  The flavorful eggplant melted in our mouths, just the way I love it, but it could've used a bigger knock of heat, so I'll have to make sure to request it next time. The generous serving of honey walnut shrimp was also delicious, with plump, crispy fried shrimp and fresh candied walnuts in a sauce that wasn't too sweet or greasy. The rock cod was our favorite, with a lot of tender, moist pieces of fish mixed in with the tender baby bok choy and fresh carrots. It tastes just like my boyfriend's mom's version. And of course, the rice was fresh, piping hot, and fluffy.   While there are dozens of Chinese places between our house and Nee House, I'd gladly make the drive up here again to try more dishes and order what have already become favorites."}
{"text":"Had take out for the first time.  New to Phoenix and Never had such a hard time locating good Chinese.  I may have found our north Phoenix/Scottsdale fix!  Good sesame chicken, Szechuan Beef, excellent fried rice with light use of oil.  We will be going back to test the service as that is a major knock that I see online.  The reception was friendly although a little slow.  We shall see!"}
{"text":"I am literally addicted to their sweet and sour soup!"}
{"text":"The BEST Chinese Restaurant east of San Francisco and southwest of New York City from a food standpoint.  Just an FYI though, the waitress their though takes a little getting used to. I would characterize her as the Soup Nazi without the hard and fast rules you need to learn, but it could come off to some as rude.   Many local Chinese eat their and even in large groups so it even further validates that it is 100% authentic and its very tasty food!!!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed lunch by myself at Nee House today.  The restaurant was clean, but not much in decor. As I entered, a fish tank with a variety of fish greeted me. More interesting were the tanks on the back wall. One was empty. Crabs were in one, lobsters in another, and healthy looking fish in the third. Seasonal prices are by the pound, not per item. A 2 1/2 pound at $16 and change is going to run just over $40. As lively as they look, I just might splurge! Some other reviews have commented on poor service.  This was not my experience at all. Both the waiter and waitress were attentive, efficient, and polite. He checked back to make sure I had everything I needed. I was very satisfied. Their menu is extensive and reasonably priced.  This also applies to the lunch menu which includes your choice of soup (sweet/sour), an egg roll, rice (white or fried), and your entree. As I like seafood, I chose shrimp and eggplant Szechuan style (see pic). It had a chili pepper by it indicating the dish was hot. My only complaint is the dish was too mild to deserve that chili. However, it was very flavorful. The hot and sour soup was solid, but not extraordinary.  Would I come back again? Yes. And I would bring my friends."}
{"text":"The service to grab a seat is slow like 20 minutes because they don't care. As soon as I sat down the waitress said you order now or leave. We ordered and 12 minutes later the food came out warm and cold and just to my luck I found a piece hair and told them and they said its not are fault. And... I said I don't want it because of this. Rude people. Dirty kitchen."}
{"text":"I love living in Phoenix.  There's no doubt about it.  This city to me is restaurant/bar heaven.  It seems like every day, a new restaurant is opening with a new twist on some new kind of cuisine.  And don't get me wrong- I love that and am an avid trier of new places. But there are some days when I earn for the simple, straight forward Chinese food I remembered eating growing up on the East Coast where good eats were plenty in the Chinatowns of New York and Philadelphia. There are some of those places in Chandler and Mesa but I live in North Phoenix and don't always want to make the drive. Well, I was pretty excited to discover Nee House- I love the food there- it's simple and it's always good.  They have a great selection of seafood entrees that puts both my son and myself in heaven.   The decor is simple and unpretentious- I always feel relaxed there and know that I am going to get fed some mouth watering delicious dishes! After this glowing review, why 4 stars instead of 5?  Because of the wait- the place can get pretty packed.  I always feel like I need to get there early to get a table without the wait- too bad the restaurant doesn't offer any \"early bird\" specials!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is definitely better than its 3.5 star rating! The decor is a little run down, but the food here is authentic and very flavorful.  Instead of driving a lot further south to mesa, this place offers some great food.  I would consider it a little pricier than your typical Chinese take out place (especially if you compare to Asian Cafe Express in Mesa), but it also operates as a higher end seafood restaurant and not the place you go for orange/kung pao chicken.  Try it out, and I would recommend ordering the roast duck  I have it at 4.5 stars right now, but would happily bump it to a 5 if I see consistency when I go back"}
{"text":"This is the perfect neighborhood family run Chinese restaurant offering reliable delicious Chinese food year around almost always open.they have your basic orange chicken lunch menus all the way up to Peking duck, live crabs lobster and fish dishes deliciously prepared.  The online menu is misleading as they have a large selection of wonderful Chinese food.   We ordered today for lunch orange chicken lunch special. The food came out nice and hot with a sweet tangy sauce the chicken well cooked tender and juicy. The dish had an egg roll and soup which choice of fried rice or white rice.  The kids got these.   We also got Beef Chow Fun, Garlic with Snow pea leaf, Salt and pepper pork chops, and Walnut shrimp.  The food was fantastic. The pork chops come out mouth watering hot. It has a bite from the jalapeño slices and just the right amount of salt.  The Chow fun is a tasty flat rice noodle dish that comes with either beef, shrimp or chicken. The noodles are cooked well and seasoned for deliciousness.  The snow pea leaf came out warm and in that rich green color. It had that nice salty garlic flavor and crunchy texture. The walnut shrimps were not overcooked and like eating candy.   The bathroom was okay. Nothing malodorous.  Service was so-so typical of great Chinese restaurants.   We have been going here for years."}
{"text":"After reading many decent reviews and seeing how close the restaurant was to home, I decided to give it a try.  The young lady at the counter was impatient and had no interpersonal skills. The food was just not good; this place is 'Chinese take-out' at best."}
{"text":"Been coming here on and off for quite a few years.  Select dishes are very good such and Kowloon crab and dried scallop and crab fried rice.  However, the service and simply rude and appalling.  There are a lot more great options for authentic Chinese food in the valley."}
{"text":"We were seated immediately.  Service can be gruff yet efficient.  We decided on spicy eggplant, Mongolian chicken, black bean chicken and seafood chow fun.  The food came quickly and smelled great.  We ate family style and enjoyed all the dishes.  The chicken in both dishes was tender and tasty.  Both were slightly spicy but not so much that you were sweating.  Rice comes with the meal.  Portions are large and there were plenty of leftovers.  A very enjoyable meal.  Prices are somewhat high but the volume is large as well.  Plenty of parking."}
{"text":"This place is comparable to Chinese restaurants in Cali and New York. My family and I have been coming here for years and never had a bad meal here.   Highly recommend the mandarin pork chops! If you're from northern China like me, these taste like home.   Also recommend the eggplant, seafood hot pot, hot and sour soup, Peking duck, and fried rice. All delicious, all authentic. Everything is family style, portions are generous.  The decor is plain, and like other reviews mentioned there's not much of an ambience. But that's not what this place is about.   Come for the food and stay for the food. It's a simple dining experience that will satisfy any Chinese food craving. Everything else is secondary. Service is efficient and gets food to your table in a timely manner. With flavors like these I really couldn't ask for more.   The restaurant is family owned and run and they are some of the nicest, hardest working people I have met.   Bottom line: If you're a diehard fan of quality, authentic Chinese food and don't mind the lack of window dressing, this place will keep you coming back."}
{"text":"Before you go to Nee House, be forewarned...... service is not great and there is no ambience to speak of.  However, it is the only Chinese restaurant in Scottsdale (that we've found) that serves authentic Chinese food!  Our primary residence is in Chicago and we grew up Chicago's Chinatown. We stay in the Troon North area when we are here and until now, we have been driving to \"Chinatown\" in Phoenix.  The food is good, authentic and fresh."}
{"text":"Found this place by just driving down the road at lunch. A few cars near by so I decided to stop in.   It was a Wednesday at lunch time. Greeted fairly fast by someone wearing a chef outfit. Sat right down. Ordered off the lunch menu ($6.99 and up) which included soup, rice, and an egg roll.   I had the garlic chicken. Delicious! It cleaned my nose right out (spicy). It was derived very fast, too. My colleague enjoyed his lunch, too.   You can get fresh fish, lobster, crab, etc as they have them there! Prices are posted on the wall no no surprises.   The waitress was not that sensitive to the fact we were working gents on lunch break so she was about as laid back as the senior citizens that were dining in at the same time we were. Always kept the water full, though.   Will be part of a regular rotation at lunch. Excited to go back and try something else!"}
{"text":"One of the rudest restaurant I have had the misfortune of going to. Went there for dinner with friends and service was slow and the place was empty. Food had little taste and when we asked for low sodium they claimed they had know even though we saw it on the table next to ours.  At end of dinner we asked for to go boxes and had to ask three tines to get them. If you love Chinese food for someplace other than NEE house."}
{"text":"First time was great! Food was tasty and we looked forward to our nect visit. The second time the staff was glaring at us and rushing  us to order when there was only 3 people in the entire restaurant. My husband and I left because we didn't care for how we were being treated. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Service not the friendliest, but the food trumps all. Served hot and delicious with just the right seasoning. The ginger chicken was outstanding"}
{"text":"Good food; however, the ambience is not that great. Next time we'll definitely order a take-out instead of dining in."}
{"text":"Being from Brooklyn I have a PHD in Chiney Food. Roast duck and Pig hanging in the window. Hand stretched noodles. Albeit we are a far stretch from Hop Kee or Big Wong in Chinatown this place does not dissapoint. They have the usual suspects here, even enough to satisfy the PF Changs crowd. Why people spend there greeny's at changs just blows me away!   If you love eggplant they do a great job with the garlic eggplant dish. The geoduk clam is exceptional. If you have to ask....google it. Im sure you could find this gastropod online. It is briny, Sweet, oceanic and more tender than you might expect. Positively great!! The pea leaf is not on the menu and it is fantastic. The cold jellyfish is a must.   Crab is fantastic and fresh. Choose your own Lobster for the Lobster in Black bean sauce. This is as close to chinatown as I have found. They are even raosting duck and serving it with multi colored rice chips; Something I have not seen since leaving NYC.   WARNING! This is a family run establishment and the family on the floor is slow and moody. However, the owner and chef is extremely nice and will create you a special dish; or just ask for him to make you anything he can dream up and he usually will."}
{"text":"We were going there for take out every Saturday night. The food is \"decent\". The portions are good. The attitude of EVERY one who works there is terrible!! They always are nasty, nasty, nasty. Am I the only one who has an issue giving my money to an establishment that don't appreciate your business. They also don't have brown rice or crispy won ton chips for soup, because \"it's a hassle\" they told me. (With an attitude again) I will travel farther and spend more money to eat anywhere else. DO NOT PATRONIZE THIS ESTABLISHMENT!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure how I rate this restaurant because I walked in to get some soup. It was around 4pm and I was in destroyed need of something that would clear my sinuses. Hot and sour soap always does the trick. I was told that I couldn't order a cup because it was supper time. That's okay, so I ordered a bowl of soup to take home... it was 11.00, and that okay too. My only thing is that it looked like a cup and the soup was not too fresh. It was good though. I'm not too sure if I would go back because the prices seemed too high and for a bowl of soup being 11.00, it wasn't great and there was much, but broth."}
{"text":"I have been on a search for decent Chinese in NE Phoenix and I think I've found it!!! I ordered chicken friend rice and sweet and sour chicken, neither of which disappointed! I love how the sweet and sour chicken was prepared- cooked in the sauce instead of just battered/fried chicken with sauce on the side!!!! I will return to try other dishes!!!"}
{"text":"Following the Yelp reviews, my daughter and I tried Nee House last week.  The service was attentive and the food was very good.  The portions are very large and the fried rice was not greasy as I have found with other Chinese restaurants in this area.  We'll be back, probably this week."}
{"text":"Not impressed with lunch. Mostly rice and noodles. Barely any chicken or vegetables. Won't be going back"}
{"text":"I go here every time for my authentic food! The price is great and the food is delicious!"}
{"text":"I love this place. There are only a few places in town that have salt & pepper pork. This is one of the best places for it. I love the fried rice with the fish. As far as Chinese food goes this place ranks up there in my top places to eat.   This is a great relief to the closing of the silver dragon. I know this place has changed hands a couple time but this one is the best of yet and I hope that they stay forever. I always like family run businesses. I like the non corporate attitude of the food and the taste of the food is perfect for my palate.   The fresh fish in the tanks and live lobster look too good and I hope to be able to sit down and order one but for now since I dine alone I will just stick to my favorites."}
{"text":"Here is the skinny - Food was okay, a little too salty for my tastes, BUT! service and trickery was at an all time high at this place. Waitress- \"We have 14.99 special for lobster today\" Us - \"Really?? wow, for the whole lobster??\" W- \"Yes, whole lobster just 14.99\" Us - \"Great we will order one lobster\"  The meal arrives we eat and finish, everything was satisfactory till the horror of the check arrives. $14.99 a LB (4lb lobster you do the math). Us- \"I think there is a mistake, didn't you say it was 14.99 for the whole lobster?\" W- \"Yes whole lobster 14.99\" Us - \"I think you may have messed up on the check\"  waitress looks at check, goes to talk to manager, then comes back W- \"No i say 14.99 a lb\" Us - \"but you just said 14.99 for the WHOLE lobster\" W- \"No i say 14.99 for whole lobster a lb\" Us- *sigh*  We know they are trying to rip us off now, but we went with guests and don't want to make a scene, so we belly up 14.99 a lb for a 4lb lobster, and we also ordered 4 other dishes. yeah.....  Thanks Nee house for being dishonest..  If you are going to go, make sure you clarify and if you can record what the waitress says before ordering. or just avoid the daily special on lobster/sea food.   -Other times i have come to nee house it has been fine, so food is okay, not great and def not the best. So decent chinese food here. Terrible service and not willing to own up for their own mistake, thats here."}
{"text":"The Nee House.......well I just wish they would get the concept of customer service! I tend to feel second rate when we go in for dinner.   I really like the food but after 5 attempts at dining in with crappy service we have decided it is best for take out only.   The food is pretty good and they are super quick when it come to take out. I am happy to say that when I picked up our order yesterday the girl at the front actually smiled and chatted with me while processing our order!"}
{"text":"You can tell it's authentic by the fork and spoon place settings. The food was alright and service was so-so. The rock cod and veggies was a tad too fishy for me. The pan fried noodles were ok and coulda used more noodles and toppings. Eggplant in garlic sauce was probably my favorite dish - big honkin' chunks of eggplant and no filler! Fried chicken was surprisingly juicy.  Why did some tables get orange slices at the end of their meal and we only got fortune cookies?"}
{"text":"Nee House is the bee's knees! No seriously though, after living in Los Angeles for the last 8 years and my frequent trips to the Bay area have exposed me to some absoutley delicious  mind blowingly good chinese food... Said mind blowingly good chinese food is hard to find here in the Valley, that was until my darling boyfriend let me in on what I consider one of his best kept secrets. I mean seriously though, you may chuckle a bit at that statement but know this... I love my food, he loves his food so when two foodies end up together you know your serious when they decide to let you in on one of the fav secret foodie spots.   So here is the 411 on the good, the bad and well maybe not the ugly.   The Good Stuff: I knew it was love at first sight when I walked in and saw tanks with live fish, crabs and lobsters! Tell me the last time you entered a resturant in Arizona, mind you a hole in the wall chinese joint that has flippin fresh live fish that aren't for decoration but rather to be consumed and doused in the delicious flavors that is Nee House. A word to the wise, get the peking duck... a whole huge duck, perfectly prepared, moist with ever so crispy skin and freshly steamed bao buns for $33.00, it's not for the faint of heart or really the appetite challenged! The shrimp with snow peas is delicious, as is the fried rice and well pretty much everything I have ever ordered from this joint (not a huge fan of their kung pao but thats my opinion)  The bad: While service wasn't bad per say, It wasn't great. The staff there was super friendly once we sat down and  they happily assisted us when we needed them, but they aren't super attentive nor did they go out of their way, and they can be a tad bit slow at times but really - when you have chinese food this good, I don't care about the service - just make sure you keep making that delicious food of yours!  So I know the boyfriend will be upset with me for ratting out this secret gem, but he knew he started dating a Yelper so really he knew food secrets don't stay that way for long!"}
{"text":"I'm an Asian who was raised with Cantonese or Hong Kong style cuisine. This was the only style you could get before Szechuan or other spicier style came to the US. Thie is the still the best way to have Chinese seafood and some other specialties such as the crispy noodle chow mein (not the stuff you get out of a can!). This is as good as anything you can can on the east coast or Chicago so we are really lucky to have a place like this here in AZ. If you like generic fried rice, egg rolls and orange chicken, please go to a buffet or Panda Express so the rest of us can enjoy this truly traditional delicious fare,"}
{"text":"A good family restaurant. Authentic Hong Kong fare.  One of the places our family goes to dinner almost each and every visit from the Bay Area. : )"}
{"text":"We ate here once and the food was good, but expensive. We got takeout for a special occasion last weekend, and the food was tasteless. We were all disappointed in the entrees we ordered. The Shanghai Noodles, my friend's favorite, were very dry with no sauce, and definitely no spices added.The Kung Pow Chicken and Mandarin Beef literally had no taste and not even soy sauce or salt and pepper would bring them up to par. We all enjoy spicy food and we found only two chiles between the two dishes, that were definitely not hot the way we like or have had at other Chinese restaurants. The only dish that resembled what we expected were the Walnut Prawns. This place is more expensive than any other Chinese takeout we have used over the years, and not worth the extra money--so you don't always get what you pay for. Our bill at Nee House was $54 [and we even tipped $6 bucks] compared to a recent similar order from Bamboo China, which was $34 and excellent! Last time we will order from here."}
{"text":"The food was outstanding. We ordered fried rice, chicken with blackbean sauce, eggplant, and bok choy. The only negative was a waitress who had the personality of a pickle. When we ask her for recommendations she replied I don't do recommendations. We tried for the rest of the night just to get her to smile. No luck. But the food is worth the lousy service"}
{"text":"Went in at 8:20; they close at 9:00 and was turned away for sit down service. The restaurant was less than 1/4 full.  So much for the new lunar new year."}
{"text":"Service was terrible. I called in for a carry-out, when I started to ask the choices, the owner got impatient and said \" why don't you come in and order it here?\" I thought the restaurant was busy and when I got there and found that there were only 3 tables occupied."}
{"text":"Just like everyone else, I echo the sentiments: Good food, bad service.  I did takeout here. I placed my order, paid, and the woman at the counter disappeared. I sat there for about 15-20 minutes. Another woman scurried out, set down three bags of food next to me and, I kid you not, her feet did not stop moving and she quickly turned and scurried back to the kitchen. I shouted after her, \"CAN I GET A BOX?\" She kept walking. I picked up the bags and within the first second one of them breaks. Of course it'd be the one with soup in it, duh!  I don't really have the desire to eat there based on my experience and the other reviews, but I got a ton of food for $50 and it was pretty good."}
{"text":"Been going for 15 years nothing in a 10 mile radius close to portions,quality. I understand the lingo and when you observe the clientele that the staff maybe commenting to each other about, you tend to agree with them. But it reminds you of New York and that service industry!"}
{"text":"So, here's the thing...I believe that things on the dinner menu are probably more tasty than items on the lunch special. We ordered 2 lunch specials(orange chicken and eggplant) and salt & pepper deep fried shrimp. The lunch specials came with a soup, we got the hot and sour soup. It was pretty good! The flavor was perfect and the broth was just thick enough. The lunch entrees were just mediocre, BUT the shrimp dish was amazing! We loved it. The jalapeños, onions and chives were a great touch. Make sure you dig inside those heads lol I think IF we came back, we would try more dishes on the dinner menu - it seems like that's where it's at."}
{"text":"A little on the pricey side. Not to generalize, but that can happen with Chinese food.  Other than price, nice staff and large portion sizes."}
{"text":"A great place to get out of the ordinary Chinese food.  This place can get really busy on weekend nights, so if you don't want to get upset about service don't go on a busy night, but if you have patience by all means.  It is after all a family owned and operated restaurant with all it's quirks. I personally have not been disappointed yet....  My favorites...chow fun, duck dishes and whatever fresh Chinese greens or vegetables they have available that day.  Seafood dishes are great too, especially clams with black beans...."}
{"text":"Best Chinese in the neighborhood. I've been coming for years. Always hot and always good."}
{"text":"My family and I have been going to Nee House for years now and it is one if not the best place to get real authentic Chinese food in Phoenix. Some of our favorites are the Singapore noodles, beef chow fun, crispy pan fried chow mein,mandarin pork chops, wonton soup, and the salt fish and chicken fried rice. Prices are decent but I would say it is worth it. If your looking for some good Chinese food then you should check this place out!"}
{"text":"Rolled in here on a whim for my never ending search to find good Chinese food in Phoenix which seems to be lacking. New House is one of the best I've found yet. All the classic dishes plus the have a large variety of live sea food in tanks used for salt and pepper crab, and the like. They have multi-dish options that are similar to say China town in NY, SF, or Chicago. The food is good, I really liked the House special chow mein and honey walnut shrimp. Definitely worth calling in some take out."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant on this side of town cause they have the best Chinese food. You can order anything on the menu and its always been very good. I like to get the rock cod with vegetables, braised string beans, house chow mein with Hong Kong style noodles. So good.   The restaurant is decorated just like a restaurant in Chinatown but we don't have a Chinatown in this city. I would say its a little tacky but clean. The service is pretty good but overall the food is really good here. For sure we'll be back."}
{"text":"The best chinese restuarant in Arizona!!!!! I've visited a few chinese resturants and nothing compares to the food here! looking for some good chinese food when you are in AZ this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Always spot on with their meals.  Good location.  Friendly.  Prices might be just a little higher than similar places, but the quality is worth it.  It's pretty much our go to place."}
{"text":"Since I already wasted my time eating here last night, I'm not going to waste any more time on a detailed review.  You don't need to know everything wrong, just run.  Let it just suffice to say that it was vial.  Not one edible item.  None of us could eat it.  Left it and went home hungry.  Worst Chinese food ever.  Oh well, I'll stick to Super Dragon, even if I have to drive further."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS! Authentic Chinese food and you get a lot of food and great quality for a good price!!! My family and I go at least once a week!!! Love this place!!!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this Chinese restaurant.  This place is authentic and the only true authentic Chinese restaurant in North Scottsdale.    Fresh tanks full of lobsters, Dungeness crabs, and tilapia fish.  You can have them prepared in a handful of ways.    Special occasions we order lobsters in the house special sauce - it's amazing!  Like finger licking good!  On the regular we get the House Special Pan Fried boodles, thin pan fried boddles in a brown sauce topped with shrimp, beef, chicken, ginger, carrots and baby bok choy.  Those skinny noodles are such a good textural experience for your taste buds.  Salt & pepper pork chops!  Lightly battered bone in pork chops fried crispy and then tossed with scallions, salt and jalapeños.  If you order one thing - you order this!  Orange beef / orange chicken is your standard affair but really tasty.  Fried rice is the best rice in Arizona!  I think they use bacon grease or some type of magical unicorn spice on their fries rice.  I see a lot of complaints about customer services, we've had no issues.  They are always friendly and polite but no, they don't go out of the way to charm the socks off of you, but I don't care, I don't need them to hold my hand during my dinner.  I just need the to keep my water filled, my food hot and fresh, my check ready when we are done and they NEVER fail to deliver here."}
{"text":"Apparently this place is a hit with the Asian community of Phoenix. Any restaurant that has a body part in the name has got to be tried.    When I first walked in, I was taken back by the mental institution looking decor with the stark white walls and the 1990s tile floor.  Decor deserves an F, but hey, it's Chinese. You never come eat Chinese for the ambiance.  Service was alright. Our deep voiced lady waitress recommended us to get the fillet Mignon cubes which was alright, nothing amazing.  We also tried the sauteed rock cod with baby bok choy which was just alright. It was nice and light though which was nice.  Finally we had the duck since my mother raved about it.  It was under seasoned and lacked any presentation whatsoever.  I mean... OK, I wasn't expecting Picasso or orange sauce to be drizzled on top like art, but come on, throw me a parsley leaf or some lettuce or something rather than just a duck.  Perhaps they have an amazing dinner menu, who knows, but Nee House was Needless to say not as Neelicious as I expected to be.  If this is the best that Phoenix has to offer in authentic Chinese cuisine, I would say it barely passed the test in my eyes."}
{"text":"i went there since its pretty close to the house and my husband has gone there more than a couple times.  i ordered the egg flower soup and won ton soup (i was sick and need soup to comfort me).  the egg flower soup was nothing special but the won ton soup was super special.  there was seafood and giant won tons.  would go back for the won ton soup $9!"}
{"text":"Kung pao Shrimp lunch with soup and egg roll was under $10, a large portion and very good!  A nice place for lunch."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the lack of flavor in the beef chow fun. It was cooked well, not soggy, but there was no flavor at all. Not interested in coming back if a simple dish like that done wrong."}
{"text":"Place is very clean. Food is fresh and tastes great. Service is fast. 9$ for a big meal is great price for what you get. You get take out  Cons Lunch size meal is a big dinner place size. Dinner size is one you could feed family of five :) joking of cause. But there is no \"bowl\" or small kids meal size. I guess people who are really hungry come here.  Waiter speak English well, but doesn't speak clearly, took me a minute to customize my order.  Radio plays music a little load for me."}
{"text":"The food here is quite decent and somewhat off the beaten platter, but there is something about the ambiance that is off-putting. I can't put my finger on it: Is it the staff who seem grudging, or the lighting which lacks brightness, or perhaps just vibes from the building or the brooding fishtanks that line the walls (Why do they seem so unhappy?) Whatever, I go and enjoy the food--although often having salt hangover later--but still feel uncomfortable. I will commend the salt and pepper pork chops and the hot and sour soup. The eggplant dishes are among my favorites."}
{"text":"So we've had some very good food at Nee House but I just don't care.   It's the fried rice..... I'm a fried rice junkie. Ever since I was a kid. I'm 1/2 Chinese and grew up in AZ. I remember fried rice at China Doll from my very early days.  Nee House's fried rice is probably the best fried rice I've ever had.   My dad is from Canton, China, and he favors the salted fish and chicken fried rice. While I love that, I have to disagree and go with the crab and dried scallop fried rice.  It is nice though to always get both & have a bit of each.  If you're eating in, they also have live seafood tanks so definitely don't ignore those.  Most of the time though, whenever I'm within stopping distance, I'm calling in fried rice orders and grabbing an order (or two) of each to bring back home to php and my family."}
{"text":"If you like to live on the more authentic side of the menu, this is pretty close to bay area level Chinese  food.  Peking duck and the fried tofu with dried scallop on bok choy are two favorites at our house. They have good soft noodle dishes and the seafood  is always amazing. I always hear about the legendary staff rudeness... but have yet to see it. Since I love the food I  guess it wouldn't  really matter."}
{"text":"This place is gross! STAY AWAY!!! The food was so bad.  The service mediocre. I only took small bites of everything and I spit it right out. I will never go back to this place."}
{"text":"RUDE RUDE RUDE. These people don't know what costumer service is. The manager was so unprofessional. I asked for a new drink because the first one was watered down, so they brought me another drink with just less ice. What a joke. So I asked for just water. (They forgot to even give to me) Then I asked for chowmein with no vegetables and they brought me chowmein with onions. At this point I was very upset due to the fact that she just dropped off our meals and didn't come back to check on us. When she came back it was because she finally heard us calling after her and I told her my order was wrong and I did not want a new one, I just wanted it off the bill. She didn't say anything and left but came back with a younger fat boy and had him tell me that there's no onions in my food WHEN THERE CLEARLY WAS. He also had the nerve to be more careful when ordering when I thought what I had order was pretty specific. I was so upset that instead of offering me a different plate or something they came to tell me that I was wrong not them. I told him to stoping being rude and that I'm not paying for the wrong meal. I will never go back and I will tell everyone who I know that has gone there about this terrible experience."}
{"text":"Edible....food was hot, the steamed rice was perfect ...not coming back unless reviews change. Does have a traditional menu though"}
{"text":"The best Chinese food we've had in a long time!  The service is not very good but it adds to the \"charm\" of Nee House and the food more than makes up for it!  We always order:  1. Salt and pepper pork chops: perfectly seasoned with just enough batter and spices.  2. Lobster with XO sauce:  plentiful with lots of yummy flavors.  Can be spicy depending on the jalapeños.  3. Salt and pepper squid: perfectly battered pieces of squid (no legs though-boooo), deep fried to absolute perfection!  4. Beef Chow Fun:  yummy flat rice noodles with tender pcs of beef, sprouts, onions, and green onions.  5. Chinese broccoli: not on the menu but ask if they have it in stock.  It's sautéed with some garlic and dried fish for an awesome \"sauce\".   The prices are reasonable (not expensive at all compared to CA) and we ALWAYS eat here on every visit to AZ!"}
{"text":"I just got back from dinner at Nee House as we had a really good experience!   It is very very clean.  There were mostly Asians in here eating and that to me is a big plus.  BIG PLUS.  Our food was delicious.  We ordered the Moo Shu pork and the House Chow Fun.  How can you not enjoy something called \"Chow Fun\"?  Anyhow, the staff was very nice, quick and let me mention again how clean the dining room was.    We will be back for sure to try more items on their menu."}
{"text":"I was not impressed by my 1st and last visit to Nee House. Both the egg drop and spicy soup were bland and could use work. The chicken in foil appetizer was chewy and looked undercooked. There was hair in the hot mustard dipping sauce cor the egg rolls. Gross! The cashew chicken was just ok. My boyfriend loved the sweet an sour pork so that's why I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1."}
{"text":"It's not the best, it's not the worst.   There's not much more to it. The restaurant does smell like fish, because they have multiple large tanks, FYI.   We enjoyed our General Tso and Sweet & Sour Chicken, but we were disappointed that we weren't able to switch out our side of white rice for a side of fried rice (My husbands favorite, so he was the most let down).   The crab Rangoon was not the best. I would not recommend. The best way I can describe the wonton is  \"flaky\".   We probably won't be back. But, that's not saying it's the worst or our experience was terrible. Fortunately, there's just better Chinese restaurants around us."}
{"text":"I've tried several dishes here and they are all delicious. Their service can be a little shaky but otherwise I'm a fan."}
{"text":"The food was ok. I got the Orange Chicken and it was plentiful. The service was terrible though. They were mean little Asians here. Told me I couldn't add shrimp, then charged me $2 to take more rice??  I felt like I was in s different country. They gave me a kids cup to start with. Will never be back."}
{"text":"Nee House seems like a standard, okay takeout place. Portions are large, even with the veggies, which is a plus. The pea shoots and bok choy were cooked pretty well. Entree items we tried were the standard American Chinese food and they were okay, but the breading on the chicken was excessive. I would eat from here if someone were already ordering it, but would not got out of my way for Nee House."}
{"text":"This is your classic zero-ambiance Chinese joint.  Reminds me a lot of places that you find in Chinatown in NYC or Boston.  The good news is that cost-cutting on the dining room floor translates into an investment in the food.  Try the cod with ginger sauce.  I normally will gloss right over this type of selection on a typical Chinese menu, but my friend suggested that I try this, and he was spot on.  The cod is cut into these elongated cakes, and the white sauce has the slight peppery flavor of ginger along with a mildly sweet/salty velvety touch.  Throw in the sautéed baby bok choy, and you have a dish that excels.  The shrimp with lobster sauce is just as delicious, as this is a great alternative to the typical Sesame Chicken or Orange Beef that you might order yourself.    Step out of the box a bit with this restaurant.  A dead giveway to its authenticity is the packed round of 10 that you will find every weekend, populated chiefly by Asian diners.  There is a secret Chinese menu here, too, so bring someone who speaks the lingo if you want to access things like whole roasted fish!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were looking for somewhere open on Christmas day. They were open. We ordered three entrées and we were both satisfied with all of them. Chinese food for Xmas:)."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  I don't think they deliver, wish they did!  The Chicken Chow Mein was outstanding.  The pot stickers were okay (thought they would be pork, but they aren't), and the rice is very good as well."}
{"text":"After trying other Asian places in the area I was discouraged that I would ever find a REAL Chinese restaurant. The decor and service leave a little to be desired but the food is terrific with the authentic \"breath of the wok\" flavor. Great for seafood!"}
{"text":"This place is much more than your average neighborhood Chinese restaurant.   First off, it has live seafood, which is the hallmark of a real Cantonese restaurant.   Fish maw, conpoy (dried scallops), steamed fresh fish, lobster, crab, these are serious delicacies!   Everything I've had there since discovering it has been wonderful. I lived for two years in South China, and it's a serious treat to find a place with good food from there.   Even stuff like their pu-pu platter is head and shoulders above anything else I've had in the valley, just because of the superior ingredients and cooking. The beef skewers are tender, succulent pieces of quality meat. The \"chicken in paper\" wrapped in foil is juicy and savory in that special Cantonese way. Their char siu is tender and delicious. Nothing is sickly sweet or soaked in oil.   I want to eat everything on the menu. This place really is a gem. I don't know of anywhere even remotely on this side of town with real Chinese food like this."}
{"text":"Stopped by Nee House for lunch the other day right before 3pm after reading reviews on yelp.  They have a lot of fish tanks with live seafood that you can order, which I thought was pretty impressive.  Lunch, however, wasn't as impressive.  The lunch menu is very small.  I normally go for a sesame or house special chicken, neither of which were on the lunch menu (and it clearly says no substitutions), so I settled for orange chicken.  Almost all of the lunch prices are $6.99, with a few options being $7.99.  For this price, you get a cup of soup (choice of egg drop or hot and sour, which I was glad for), your entree, white or fried rice, and a spring roll.    The hot and sour soup smelled incredible, but sadly didn't live up to its scent.  I added some salt, but it didn't really help it out.  This being said, it's much better than almost all other hot and sour soups I've had around here.  The orange chicken was white meat and somewhat dry.  The sauce was okay, not too much flavor there either.  The spring roll wasn't bad.    A gentleman came in after me and ordered fried rice with his meal.  After he ordered, the staff started streaming out of the kitchen to eat a family-style lunch at one of the large corner tables, bringing out their own plates of rice for themselves.  When the gentleman received his food, he let the guy know that he had ordered fried rice, but they had given him steamed.  The older woman that had been taking care of us then told him that they were 'out' of fried rice.  Total crap, am I right?  If he ordered it and it was fine then, why isn't it now?  It soon became clear when the dishwasher came out with his own plate full of fried rice to eat at the corner table with the other staff.  I almost couldn't believe it.  The gentleman didn't catch this however, so he didn't complain.  I felt bad for him.  They obviously don't care too much about it, since they didn't offer to cook him a side of it.  Oh well.  Based on the food, I won't be coming back.  My search for good chinese food in the valley continues."}
{"text":"If you go for the food, it's 5 stars. Just stay away from the dishes that cater to Americans. I'd recommend Dry Scallops and crab fried rice, Vegetable A, pea leaves, and any of their crab dishes. If you expect a good service, don't go there (or order take out instead). This place gets packed during peak hours on weekends. I often order take outs during holidays like Thanksgiving or Christmas (Yes, they are open!) but order ahead; sometimes it takes one hour. This place is one of the best Chinese restaurant in the valley. All the bad rating is due to service...reason why I only gave 4 instead of a 5."}
{"text":"Love love love this place.  Moved here 6 mos ago from the SF Bay Area and was really disappointed in the lack of tasty food (don;t get me wrong - I love my new desert home), but it takes a while to find new favorites.  I've found one in Nee House.  The only thing I haven't liked here is due to a personal preference - not the food itself (I loathe green onions or rather - it's a mutual loathing!!!  cuz these things just don't want to die!!!).  The service is good and can accomodate large parties well if you call ahead.  I was surprised to read other posts about lack of friendliness and service as that has never been my experience - even before I was a regular.  Hey, we all have bad days - or aren't as \"chipper\" as others think we should be sometimes, right?  Anyway - I am SO glad to have found Nee House.  It's a keeper. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Horrible service Nasty staff Owner is mean Just not worthed No smiles at all Flavorless and expensive  Will never go back again!!!!"}
{"text":"The wait staff is as nasty as the food. RUDE AND UNFRIENDLY SERVICE; they act like they are annoyed that you came in to dine in their restaurant. The meat and chicken (if you can call it that) is spongy and bland.  Since I have worked in food service, I am guessing they use \"processed meat product\".  Some restaurants use this because it is extremely cheap and doesn't need to be refrigerated.  We left full plates of food because it was INEDIBLE!"}
{"text":"4.5 stars if I could! My review is based on several visits during lunch. My impression: this is the best Chinese restaurant I've tried in my 8 years of living in Phoenix. Originally from Seattle, I've had my share of Chinese food. This place is very good! I'm very impressed. Love the egg drop soup. The fried rice needs a little more veggies/eggs, but overall had a good flavor. The chicken they use is very good quality. My whole family really enjoyed this place. Not sure why so many low reviews on here. I'm quite confused..."}
{"text":"Pretty good authentic Chinese food in the nicer part of Phoenix area.  Quick service, literally.  You place your order and it comes out in 5 minutes, but it's hot and delicious.  I would go back.  This place is very clean, BTW.  If it helps, I'm Asian and I know my Chinese.  I only gave it a 3-star because I've had better in SoCal, that's all.  But I'd say it's up their in the top 3 in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I really like this place. I only wish they had  brown rice?!?  Love the Kung Pao chicken, egg rolls are really great too!  NEE HOUSE, offer brown rice please!!!!!"}
{"text":"Generally our favorite Chinese Restaurants are in Chandler, Tempe or Mesa. We also frequent New Hong Kong and Silver Dragon but did not feel like driving all that way.  Been here a few times and also have done take out.  Recently ordered the Young Chow Fried Rice and the House Special Chow Mein with the Hong Kong Style Noodles. Both dishes were prepared very well and very good authentic Chinese style.  This Chinese Restaurant serves good old style authentic Cantonese Style dishes and all the dishes we have had have been prepared as good as the better Chinese Restaurants around.   The staff, workers and owners are not the friendliest people and when they see other Asians have to ask so many questions to see if they know you or your family. That's okay, they are just the old style Chinese people and are interested in if in some way they may know your family or someone in your family.   The prices that were charged did not match what was on line for the 2 items that was ordered. Don't know if the website I looked at needs to be updated.   Overall, good food and will come back again"}
{"text":"I'm torn on this one. These people have some of the most delicious and authentic Chinese food in the area, but the service is below atrocious. If you are black, white, or Hispanic they will most certainly say things about you in their own language. They speak Chinese and Vietnamese. I went with a good friend of mine who is Vietnamese and they were translating all the stuff they were saying about customers in their respective language. The head lady there is one of the most unpleasant people to do business with. She's rude, grouchy, and borderline disrespectful.         Conversely, the food there is beyond authentic. I'm a foodie and I know good food. It's quality and delicious. Certain dishes you will not find anywhere else. It is simply a hole in the wall with extraordinary food. Walnut shrimp, PuPu platter, hot and sour soup, egg rolls, low mein , and of course the live seafood. It tough to give my money to to these people because the service is so substandard but those food is epic.   As long as you know all this info going in, your much better off in terms of managing expectations."}
{"text":"Great Christmas Eve dinner at Nee House!  Clams in black bean sauce and Sizzling Mixed Seafood.  Delicious as always.  Service leaves a great deal to be desired, as always, but the food always wins out."}
