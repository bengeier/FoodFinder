{"text":"Had the BBQ duck here and will say that please pass on this dish! Too oily, skin was not crispy and we really did not like the duck, blegh."}
{"text":"I dont know how this place is so highly rated...taste is good but extremely stingy. I was in the area and decided to give this place a try. Ordered the roast pork and bbq pork but portions were incredibly small. Not only portions were small, they used bits and pieces leftover for the rice combo. Ive been going to HKS Bbq for years, shouldnt have bothered coming here."}
{"text":"Brought a BBQ duck rice in the later afternoon, it taste so bad.  Duck is Over night leftover and it's smelt burn.  They still give me the burn skin duck for my take out. So bad...never want to go back again.  Service is bad too."}
{"text":"Little mom and pop kinda place.  Don't be shy the food here is amazing.    The lady cutting the meat is better then any surgeon.  The food is presented with perfect cuts. She takes her time and makes sure it's perfect even if there's 20 people in line. cash  only.   Probably the best roast pork I've had!"}
{"text":"Heard its good and came here 6-ish on a weeknight. Almost everything gone but still wanna give it a try. It's such an awful experience. I was so regret. They just made me feel like they don't care about your business. This is the WORST service I have ever had. I'll never come back again no matter how good your stuffs are. Damn it."}
{"text":"I come here at least once a week. Its a take-out kind of place. Dont expect any fancy seating. If you looking for classically cooked \"chinese meats hanging in a window\", then this place is for you. The quality is always good and always reliable. Its like the mcdonalds of chinese cuisine; its the same anytime you go!"}
{"text":"During busy hours the line can be quite slow, it is cash only and famous for their fried bbq pork.  It is great value though, one of my go to places for take out."}
{"text":"This is a great place for those who enjoy a cheap and delicious lunch. I come here a lot when I was in high school for lunch since it was only 6.95$ for a lunch box with your two choice of meat. The bbq pork and the duck is delicious. The roast pork is above average but gets out shinned by everything else they have there. I do recommend coming if you're looking for an alternative to fast food"}
{"text":"AMAZING!!  Looks like a hole in the wall, but man, is the food ever delicious.
I HIGHLY recommend bbq pork and the sausage.  
You can get meat of your choice on rice to eat as a meal.  Only $6.
I have also bought extra bbq pork to have in the fridge.  I pound is $7.
If you are near, this place is a must.  (It's the plaza with the McDonald.)"}
{"text":"** REVIEWER'S CHOICE **

\"The one with the awesome BBQ pork.\"

The Good:
Best BBQ pork I've had anywhere in the GTA area; relatively low price ($5.25, they don't charge tax); they let you (or more like they don't care) if you bring outside food in as long as someone else ordered; self-serve Tea

The Bad:
Not really suited for dine-in BBQ pork (they have a total of maybe 10 chairs along the side with stools and one table that can fit maybe 4 people); long lineups during lunch (but this is a sign that it's good!);

Overview:
If you're a fan of BBQ pork, this is a must eat. Simple as that. When I first started working around the Richmond Hill location, I wasn't too familiar with the places around here. On the first day of work for lunch a colleague of mine asked what I wanted to eat and I said: \"something cheap and good\". Well, we were soon at the parking lot  on Valleymede just north of Highway 7. It's in the same plaza as the McDonald's there. When you step in, it's relatively undecorated but I knew that this wasn't really meant for a dine-in seeing as how there weren't many tables (although many BBQ pork places aren't anyway). Still, they had a long table-bench against the two walls of the inside with stools placed accordingly for those who did want there. There was also one single small table for a party of 4 to dine-in. The menu can be somewhat confusing, but I'll break it down here: They have a Small and a Large rice box, with your choice of two meats to go on top of it. The main ones that people often get are BBQ pork, Soy Sauce Chicken and Roasted Pork. Most people just get a \"Small BBQ Pork on Rice\", which has two servings of BBQ pork on rice and it comes out to $5.25 (they don't charge tax, which is pretty decent). You can switch one serving of meat to any of the others for no additional cost. Sometimes they even have specials like Curry Squid which you can swap out for 25 cents more (I personally found the squid to be OK, but my friends love it. The curry is pretty spicy and the squid's not baby squid...it's the larger ones which I'm not a big fan of). The large box, I can't remember how much it cost, but I've been there time and time again and I wouldn't recommend it. It was about $2 more I think and all you get is a lot more rice and a little bit more meat, served in what looks like to be a somewhat larger container. The small is pretty filling as it is and it's definitely the best bang-for-the-buck. You can also order just the meats themselves which is an even better value although I wouldn't recommend just eating the meats alone for a meal...you'd probably want some rice to go with it. If you're taking out, then I recommend getting  a pound of BBQ pork: it comes out to $5 or so and it has double the amount of meat on a regular Small BBQ Pork on Rice. It's perfect for takeout or if you were somehow keen enough to bring rice from home and just share it with a friend (=.

Anyway, regarding my first lunch there, we both ended up getting a small BBQ pork on rice and each spent $5.25. As it was my first time there, we decided to dine in. We found two stools along the side and each got some self-serve tea from the corner near the window. The quality of the BBQ pork is just absolutely fantastic, probably the best BBQ pork I've had. It's more on the \"glazed and crunchy\" side of BBQ pork so for those who like the softer types than this might not sit well with you but definitely give it a shot because I used to like the soft type too before this. Now, I can honestly say it's the best BBQ pork in the GTA area and for $5.25, it's a steal. 

Between long consecutive meetings throughout the afternoon, my colleagues and I often come here for \"BBQ Pork Runs\". Relatively quick (might have a bit of lineup sometimes), cheap, good quality food...you can't go wrong. I sometimes even come along with a friend if he didn't bring a packed lunch and I did; I'd still dine in as long as there were many open spaces (don't want to take up a spot of someone who actually did buy and wanted to dine-in), and they don't mind. Definitely recommended - you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The serving size is decent for what you pay. Very busy during lunch and dinner hours and cash only. It can be hard to find, but it's in the same plaza as McDonalds."}
{"text":"This place is my all time fave BBQ place in the GTA.  Kum Hong has been open in this plaza since the beginning of time and brings back memories when I came here for lunch during High School.  

The BBQ Pork (Char Siu) is amazing as it is the perfectly cooked and the fat ratio is good.  The Roasted pork is good as well and the skin is always crispy.  The price is decent for the amount of food you are getting.  This place is cash only.

I think I tried almost everything in the menu and l liked almost everything they offered but my fave is the roasted duck and BBQ pork (char siu) for sure.  

The place is very small and the line up usually hits the door.  Kum Hong is mostly a take out place as they only have 3-4 seats along the window for you to sit at."}
{"text":"3.5
I'm not a fan of hanging meats but everyone else seems to really love it. This place has been around for years in the same plaza as McDonald's on valleymede. Come with cash."}
{"text":"Very little seating. Best for take out. Having eaten Chinese Barbecue, I was floored how good this place was. I will definitely be returning for a second taste hoping they are consistent. 
Cash only. Broken Chinese is acceptable to order here. They do not offer hoisin sauce for the roast pork, nor plum sauce with the roast duck. But still incredibly good."}
{"text":"I work  close by at nights  and come here often for the crispy pork, and also u cant beat that price for two meats and rice for 6.50$ tax in.
I due wish they sayed open later, however i can see how 8:30pm is a good time to close,  as business reallly slows down by then, also the crispy pork seems to be really popular and does run out quite often.
As a chinese take out bbq place i think they have it figures out.
Staff is friendly, fast and taste that u cant beat."}
{"text":"Time and time again when I frequent this BBQ takeout restaurant, their roast pork is absolutely the best I have had from around the GTA.  The quality is as good as it gets.  The roast pork sells really fast there. Best time to go and get roast pork is at 11am and 4pm.  That is the time it is brought out and people will wait patiently for it.  The piggy is roasted to perfection and there is not too much fat as found from other BBQ take-out places.  The lady who cuts it is a perfectionist as she will cut it so it looks appetizing and fills up the take out container very nicely.  Well done!  Tried many other places and so far none compares."}
{"text":"One of my go to places for BBQ pork and duck on rice for lunch. The roast pork is average at best. Portions are decent and the price has gone up over the years. The line moves really really slow here thou. The poor lady working there is getting old but they are very nice. There's been a few times the line was so long  I just gave up and and went to Mc.D."}
{"text":"I LOVE the roasted pork here.  It is a bit more expensive than some other places BUT they cut out the fat before they weigh it.  Sure...minimal, but I appreciate that.  Makes you feel better about eating it.  We've also had the BBQ pork and duck.  Everything has been great.  It's also always busy.  Doesn't matter what time of day."}
{"text":"The super long lineups that are almost out the door should already be a sign that this place is a solid Chinese BBQ joint. 

Having tried the BBQ pork (chasiu), BBQ duck, BBQ chicken, and soy sauce chicken, the cuts of meat I got were fairly good. Because they were tender and saucy, I was able to eat a lot more rice than usual! I also really liked that they gave us some green onion and ginger on the side, without having to ask. It definitely made the meal tastier.

Their price point is fair for their location in Richmond Hill but I would say that I could definitely find better and cheaper in Scarborough."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Chinese BBQ places in the area. The place gets uber busy. The roast pork and duck are excellent and the lady who cuts the meat does an excellent job. Note -they don't give sauce with the roast pork. However, be prepared for long wait times. Depending on your patience and how much you value time, you may want to go to Johnny's BBQ in the Chalmers plaza."}
{"text":"The food here are amazing!!!!! Nice people and nice place! The 1st choice always!

Recommend BBQ duck, Chicken, BBQ pork and roasted pork well everything I have to say."}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese BBQ place.  As other reviews have noted, the lady chopping the meat is always ensuring that you get a fair amount and fair variety of bbq meats. Price is reasonable and quality is great."}
{"text":"Good spot for a cheap lunch, however it's not my favourite Chinese BBQ takeout. 

I ordered a lunch combo of roast pork and bbq duck. The pork was tender and juicy with a very nicely done crispy skin. Duck was okay as well, but the skin wasn't as crispy as I would have liked, it was still really fat. Also they gave me a me big amounts of pork, but very little duck. With the combo, they put in a little bit of ginger and onion sauce, which I thought was suppose to go with chicken only. And there's NO VEGETABLES!!! Most Chinese barbecue combos should come with some sort of veggies, bak choy or cabbage, or something. But there was NONE. Which is a very big disappointment for me, I understand that meat loving guys might not mind, but after having so many pieces of greasy meat and rice, I do want some veggies to cleanse my palate and also to have a healthier diet. Now I have to go grab a salad from McDonald's next door, then it just doesn't make the cheap price worth it. 

Probably won't be coming back, unless I'm getting a whole duck or chicken to add to a family dinner, then I don't have to worry about the vegetable problem."}
{"text":"A OK for what it is. A small Chinese BBQ take-out restaurant. BBQed ducks hanging with their heads intact. Cleaver cutting through bones. I decided to stick to the familiar and order chicken legs.

Fresh Chinese BBQ. Quick service despite the lineup. Reasonable prices. Check it out if you are in the area and craving Chinese BBQ. Or if you never had it before and want to try something new."}
{"text":"So growing up in richmond hill my family used to always get chinese bbq from here. That is, until we discovered Excellent BBQ at richlane mall. Make no mistake folks, kum hong is amazing but it isn't the crème de la crème aka cream of the crop! Excellent BBQ is simply a cut above with their meats (pun intended). If you think this place is the best chinese bbq in the area go on over and try excellent bbq RIGHT NOW. In the meantime, i've come back to kum hong for a couple of recent visits (for nostalgia's sake) and it is absolutely deserving of its 4 stars. Just Not The Best Though =P ... and this is coming from a dude who eats chinese bbq once every week minimum lol. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Hands down best Chinese bbq in GTA!"}
{"text":"This place has delicious Chinese BBQ Meats. it is $5.50 for rice + 2 meats (or one) with the choices you can have something different every day of the week. the BBQ Pork is amazing, one of the best i've had especially if they still have half fatty. the bbq chicken wings is perfectly glazed and flavoured (my fav). the roasted pork has a great ratio of meat + fat + crunchy skin. you have go to try every combination! will differently come back for lunch take out."}
{"text":"Their BBQ pork portion is small.  It was chopped up in small pieces too and too chewy.  I got the tips (mainly the red part) twice, very bad experience."}
{"text":"Got their roast pork ($9.99/lb before tax). Skin was crispy and balanced meat-fat-skin ratio.  No line-up on a Monday evening around 6:00pm."}
{"text":"BBQ pork is my fav food. I've been all over the city, country etc to try bbq pork and nothing compares to this place. It's the BEST BBQ PORK!"}
{"text":"Definitely the best BBQ and roasted Chinese pork I've ever had! Seriously delicious! The crispy skin on the roast pork is perfect an the bbq pork has a delicious sweetness! Just wish I could get more ginger and scallion sauce without the $3.50 tag for a condiment other places nearby give as much as you want for free!"}
{"text":"Their roast pork is excellent i must admit, but their char siu and roast duck were below avg esp when i order the combos, most of the duck pieces were just bones and no meat, the char siu was just scraps and bit and pieces and had no burnt ends like Pink Heong or Johns BBQ. I would give them four stars if not for the uneven portions and lousy customer service. I would just stick with the roast pork or prepare to be disappointed."}
{"text":"Simple, cheap, delicious.  If you want Chinese BBQ, this is the place.  Particularly for those west of the 404 along Highway 7 who don't want to trek out east to First Markham Place's food court, this place can't be beat.  It's located at Valleymede & Highway 7, in the McDonald's plaza.

The decor is extremely sparse - basically a small table and counter for sit-down clientelle, but most are just takeout.  Menu is simple and I'd say at least 80% of the people go for the standard $5.50 combo of rice + 2 meats, which also comes with some sauce and a small spoon of that addictive salty green onion ginger salad.  Nasty stuff the first time you try it but believe me it grows on you.  If you do choose to eat in they also provide free tea, and recently even added a microwave for your meals - I guess if you're coming in with others that have food from other establishments?  Or you want your food extra hot perhaps?

Come before noon or closer to 1pm otherwise you'll have a bit of a line to stand in.  The meat is hung behind a glass display case (typical of most BBQ places) and you choose what you want and the girl will expertly chop it in front of you and lay it on the rice.  A few times I catch her looking away while she cleaver the meat and I think it's a wonder she hasn't lost a finger before, but she knows what she's doing.  

Favourite meats - bbq pork and roasted pork (with the crispy skin - so bad, but sooo good).  Chicken and duck also available, and some sausage.  You can also buy just the meat by the pound to take home - all a good deal.  I could probably eat this stuff every day - and nice to have it local.  It's bare bones in terms of their ambience, but the food more than makes up for it.  Their quality is always bang on, the stream of customers is constant and this place has been around a long time.  Hope it stays here for a while!"}
{"text":"Oh ya!!! My co worker and I have been going around Markham and Scarborough to find the best.  In regards to the quality of the meat this place wins. The roasted pork skin was crust but not overly greasy and the meat was seasoned well and tender.  I find some places salt the hell out of the meat.  Only draw back is that it was rice and pork, I expected some veggies like other places but if I am rating specifically the meat, hands down best so far."}
{"text":"I have tasted many ( and I mean many) Chinese BBQ and Roasted Pork and I dare you to find a better one!   If there is such thing as 100 things must-try-before-you-die, then this place is one of them. 

I am so sure of myself that I want to write this review.   The meat cutter lady will trim all the fat and arrange the pork pieces with such passion and dedication equalled to none. So intensely that there is almost never time for any eye contact, and will never ever get an order wrong.  So focussed, like a horse with blinders on.   If only I could hire her to work in my department, productivity will just skyrocket.  ( I have nicknamed her WB's girlfriend ... which is the subject of another discussion)

The BBQ pork (Char Siwe) and roasted pork with crispy skin are prepared and cooked to perfection, so good, unbelievably good.   I levied a penalty of 1 star for not serving a wee bit of green vegetables with the combo. 
You will have the time of your chives.  
Oops! I mean the time of your life."}
{"text":"I decided to venture out of my comfort food zone and try something incredibly meaty, and well, BBQ-ed. Kum Hong is a take out Korean BBQ place nestled in a suburban plaza near many commercial buildings. Seriously, every restaurant offering a lunch deal thrives like it's nobody's business. 

On my early evening visit I was weirded out by the BBQ-ed pigs heads, resting it up a la Lord of the Flies. Many a sleepless nights I suffered throughout grade nine and a flashback to raw meat was really throwing my hungry body off. Stomach says eat, brain says run. 

I ordered the BBQ chicken on rice, $5.75. The meat portion isn't meager by any means, but the Chicken:Rice ratio is out of whack. It also comes with the 'delectably' fatty skin. Obviously, BBQ is not my thing, so I sucked it up and gently pulled off the skin before eating. Not bad. Actually, much better. If you enjoy BBQ I'm sure you'll really like Kum Hong. 

Be advised that the shop is not a really a sit down place, but I did see a couple of chairs at a high table near the window. Cash only!"}
{"text":"The best mixture of value, quality, and deliciousness. The large rice combo is super filling and all the meats are really good, especially the duck and roast pork. Obviously the décor is not very good and the lines are slow but they are really only focused on the food, and they succeed."}
{"text":"** 4.5 Stars **

15 Word Summary: Best takeout Asian BBQ Pork, in terms of price, flavour, and quick takeout turnover     blah. (there it's 15 words)

BBQ'ed food is already legendary as is but Asian style BBQ is some sort of mythical magical food expedition that you only get to experience if you're lucky and end up in a great restaurant.

Luckily Kum Hong BBQ is one of those great restaurants. For $5.25 (CASH ONLY) you get a bed of rice with a good serving of juicy, delicious, amazing BBQ pork. In terms of price, flavour and texture, this BBQ CANNOT be beat (yes I challenge you to find a competitor!). 

However I have to say that this place really isn't much of a \"restaurant\". Tea is self-serve, there's no real dining space except for two small counters where you will be crowded by the lineup of people looking to fill their appetites with BBQ Pork, chicken, duck, etc. But I don't really care as long as they can keep the cost as low as this!"}
{"text":"Favourite chinese BBQ place in the GTA. Roast pork is crispy and juicy!"}
{"text":"If you want good BBQ and do not care about customer service, then this place is for you. I come here to get take out BBQ, roast pork and soy sauce chicken. I've been coming here for years and have no expectations other than good food. I have never seen the lady cashier smile not even once in my years of buying from this place. I thought I'd get used to it by now, but I was wrong. Today I ordered my usual which was a combo of bbq pork and soy sauce chicken.  She snapped at me and said, ' you want 1lb  1/2 lb, what do you mean?' To which I replied, 'on rice'. If I 
was in a nicer restaurant I would have left, but this was one of those moments where you just bite your tongue and count to 5, knowing that you'd rather keep quiet and ensure you have dinner on hand or drive up to FMP. They have been in this business so long that they either forget or don't care about providing good customer service since they know they have a steady clientele, with or without any effort to smile. 
3.5 stars for the food and 1.5 stars for the non existent customer service. I won't be a hypocrite, I will still continue to visit this bbq place until I find a better one"}
{"text":"A solid four and half stars based on food only.  If anyone likes Chinese BBQ food with rice for a quick lunch, or even quick dinner, this is the place to buy take out.  See my photos with star rating.  

Also I believe it uses good quality rice, it taste good, unusual for a take out BBQ house.  The other BBQ houses that I had eaten, the rice were not very good."}
{"text":"This review is for the BBQ ducks (or roasted duck) and BBQ pork.  BBQ duck is my favourite Chinese BBQ, followed by BBQ pork.  We ordered takeout for both.  The BBQ pork was good/okay/decent.  The BBQ duck was meh.  The flavors were off.  Either some spices were missing or the spices are not in the right ratio.  I will return for the BBQ pork, but won't buy duck from here again."}
{"text":"Go to place for Chinese BBQ meat! Our fave is the BBQ pork aka char siu. Also they have great rice combinations. There is some seating but mainly a take out place. Be prepared for a wait. Even when there's no long line up, it takes a bit to get your order because the lady who cuts your meat is very precise and takes some time. Worth the wait!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Chinese bbq places. Their duck is so marinated so well and barely has any gamey taste. The roast pork is so tender and the skin is so crunchy. 

The only downside is that this place is slow! I mean the workers who cut the BBQ meat do it so slowly so a line is always formed. They also close early when the meat is sold out so go early."}
{"text":"This place has been around since ... well forever.. My parents have been coming here since we first moved to the area - way way back in 1987/88 - Plus it pretty much a family owned place, the daughters took over the business when the father passed on - but the quality is still there.

This place is only pretty much for take-out only - there is literally only seating along a counter against the window and that's it.

The prime time to hit this place up for your dinner meats is pretty much between 3- 5 pm any later and you might not get the selection you want, eg. their Roasted Pork - as they only roast two pigs a day, so once they sell out - they sell out. 

The service can be a bit slow, but its really on the two sisters manning the counter and there is almost always a line - so expect to wait anywhere between 0 - 30 min to getting service - but to me and my family that wait is worth while.

One of my siblings adore their rice boxes - which is a large take out container and you choose your meat, so in his case - his favourites are the BBQ Pork and Roasted Pork and it's a cheap meal that rings in under $10.

My mom's favourite is the (directly translated - old water) duck wings as one of her favourite things that this place has to offer. 

For me - I think my favourite is their curry squid, which sooo good, spicy, but not too spicy, and you get tender squid too.

I think my biggest gripe is that their stuff is good enough that they only make enough for each day and that's it, so once it's sold out - it's pretty much sold out.

Kum Hong has and will always be CASH ONLY - so bring cash with you."}
{"text":"I've gotten take out here before and finally got a chance to come for lunch today. From the few times I've come there's been a line and it doesn't move that quickly. The lady chopping the meat really takes care to chop and arrange it everything nicely in the take out containers so I can appreciate that. There's only bar stools and a little table for 4 on the corner so don't expect a dine in experience. 

I've only tried the BBQ pork (char siu) and roasted pork (siu yok) so far and both are excellent. The BBQ pork is nicely marinated with lots of flavour and not dry even with the leaner pieces. The roasted pork has an excellent crispy skin that makes a satisfying crunch sound when u bite into it. I got the small rice box and it came to $6.75 which is pretty cheap but there wasn't as much meat as I was expecting. Still filled me up so no complaints. My mom also says the BBQ pork is expensive at $8.99/lb when other places have it at $6.99-$7.99/lb but this place does it consistently well so I'll still pay it. All in all, this place is a little delicious hole in the wall."}
{"text":"710pm on a weeknight and they were mostly sold out - closing at830pm if not sooner as the stools were already up on all the tables. No frills, cash only.

The lady instructed to heat up in the microwave before eating. A bit of chicken and a bit of char siu to go with rice. The rice got smeared with yummy ginger-garlic-green onion sauce.

Taken to go. A solid 3 based on the food."}
{"text":"We came here for a quick pick up of potluck dishes for a dinner party on a Saturday about an hour before closing. 
They take your order, watch them slice it up, piled neat and nicely into a box then cash out.

They didn't have much meats left but I did catch the last batch of BBQ pork and roasted pork. BBQ pork was good. 
Roasted pork was tasty and tender, the skin was crispy and had a crunch when you bit into it. Crispy and seasoned well. It was so good with other sides or just on its own! 
I prefer the roasted pork as it had equal parts of fat to meat and crispy skin. 

Lots of parking spaces in the plaza."}
{"text":"In town for work and took my clients out for lunch and was pleasantly surprised by how good the food is here. Though there was a bit of a line and not much seating, once we got our food to the office there wasn't much of a conversation with everyone enjoying their meals. Definitely coming back for that chicken and duck combo"}
{"text":"Small no-frills establishment serving food that is consistently good, it doesn't get much better than this in Toronto when it comes to Chinese BBQ."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Chinese BBQ joint in the GTA!  There's a reason why there's always a line of people waiting to pick up their order!

First let me state that I never like to order roast pork from BBQ joints as the meat is always fatty at most places...however roast pork is what I always order at Kum Hong!  I don't know how they do it but most of the fat is somehow rendered off leaving just a little fat and the most crispy roasted skin that absolutely crackles in your mouth when you bite into it!  The meat itself is absolutely perfectly seasoned and the ginger onion oil adds the perfect season on top of a bed of rice.  

Pair this up with the leanest and most tender \"char siu\" BBQ pork with there sauce and you have heaven!

I've never had a bad meal here.  The roast duck, soy chicken are all outstanding!   I hate drive by because I always find myself accidentally dropping in even when I already ate!

I never go anywhere else for Chinese BBQ!   Please note the roast pork usually sells out by around 1-2pm and the next batch usually doesn't come out till 4pm or so.  

Some stools are in the store but most people order to go.  $6.50 for a regular rice combo with up to 2 choices and $7.50 for a larger rice combo.  Cash only.

Man I'm starting to drool thinking about it!"}
{"text":"The rice combo is incredible. I have been getting the BBQ pork/Roast pork split for over 10 years now and it never disappoints. The place is pretty bare bones, but the food quality is outstanding. Super nice people serving you. It gets really busy at lunchtime and right after work."}
{"text":"One of the best roast ducks in markham. The tofu is great too, although a bit pricier than other places, they fry it to order, so its pretty worth it. 

The woman who cuts the meat is a bit weird. Never acknowledges people. Never speeds up when there is a line, which I respect. The one thing that drives me nuts is, she makes multiple chops to make the same cuts, which leaves bone pieces. Usually the technique is to make one strong chop to avoid shattering bone, but she just does her own thing."}
{"text":"Stopped in to sample some of the delicious pork before I bring it home and I was very pleased. There's no frills here, just good Chinese BBQ. Tried the rice combo with BBQ and roast pork. The BBQ pork was well cooked, fatty and flavourful. The roast pork had perfectly crisp skin, excellent flavour and was very moist. Some of the best Chinese BBQ I've had in quite some time. They also add a very tasty garlic/ginger/onion medley to add a twist of flavour. It would be nice if there were some accompaniment options other than just rice, but definitely worth popping into."}
{"text":"The roasted pork has crispy skin and tender flavourful meat. The Char Siu is a 3 out of 5 . Colour is an off red, dry but taste okay. The rice box comes with good tasting soya sauce and the ginger and onion. The butcher chops off excessive fat off the roasted pork. Takes a long time but not bad."}
{"text":"It's cheap for what it is, but there are many options in the area which delivers the same quality and price.

I'd rather go elsewhere if I'm craving for some good chinese bbq meats :P"}
{"text":"The best HK style BBQ in Toronto. The lady that does he cutting is a true perfectionist. The meats are hands down the most consistent of any BBQ place around. Also if you want lean roast pork you just need to let the lady know. The best items are the BBQ pork, roast pork and duck. There is always a line up and they alsways sell out by dinner time. Give it a try. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Decent BBQ for the area and frequented by the boys in blue... So that says a lot for the quality of food.  They sell out by 545 as everyone is on their rush home.  It will be slim pickings after that so buyer be warned!"}
{"text":"Easily the best Chinese BBQ you can get in Markham/Richmond Hill. I often go here for lunch takeout because I work just around the corner. Not a lot of space for dine-in. Mostly a takeout cash only joint, there are a few seats for single seating but will not accommodate larger groups. Location is hard to find at first and parking around lunch time can sometimes be hard to get. Portions are good for the price and I'm left full every time. Ordering is easy as the ladies speak both fluent English and Chinese. I always get the BBQ Pork and Roasted Pork and i must say it's the best I've ever had. Also comes with a little bit of garlic sauce on the side. The lineups during peek hours can sometimes cause longer than usual wait times especially when some people have larger orders but nothing too crazy. Roasted pork is crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside not dry like some places. The BBQ pork is also very tasty, soft not chewy and flavorful. Awesome, must try place for quick takeout lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"BEST BBQ PORK EVER

I stumbled upon this very unassuming place about 15 years ago when I  worked near by. At the time a good portion of 'cha su' and streamed rice was a 5er$.
FFWD to 2007 and my new BF (still my BF) lives not far at 7 & Yonge. Ya! Lost and found. I'm a kid of immigrant retauranteurs and we would go every Sunday downtown for 'real' Chinese food when I was a kid.
I only get the cha su, not into duck and just haven't tried the crunchy skin pork that looks juicy and amazing.

Here are the facts:
What its NOT:

no atmosphere, not a 'nice' place to stay and eat
absolutely NO FRILLS
despite the sign (I laugh every time) it is NOT FAST, they have ONE speed,(never gets further than first gear)
 one person cutting the meat and I know that will never change
service is not all smiley, basic to the point but not rude
be prepared to wait in line, bring a novel, lol

What it IS

best Chinese bbq I've ever had in my life
they've been around a LONG time, which tells you there's a reason and the long line ups  of my other Asian kin is also very telling (we are a very picky sort;)
I wish I wish they had a veg I could have to with my rice n pork - maybe one day

I usually get 2 lbs and 1 lb is gone a couple hours when it gets in the door between the 2 of us. it's fresh and delicious.
I don't care about the price (which, according to my frugal mom is so expensive!) haha

Just go get the food, take it home, be patient in line.
Boy, I love this place!

PS I tried the wings - pass on those, kinda dry lack flavour"}
{"text":"That BBQ pig heads and all those duck heads really makes a great photo opportunities! 

When we arrived at almost closing time at Kum Hong BBQ Restaurant.. not much choices left.. all the Roasted duck was gone... 1/5 of the roasted pig left... and some BBQ pork.

Customers lining up trying to get some takeout to share with their families.. or in our case, we just too lazy to cook... 

BBQ Pork is A-OK! Good mix of fat and lean pork... a little salty but balanced out with a hint of honey. 3 Star

Roasted Pork is one of the best I have. Skin still perfectly crisp, and that crunchy sound that it made in my mouth is just priceless!! The pork itself is nice, tender and juicy... hmmmmm... 4 Star

I think we will definitely be back if some one doesn't feel like cooking a full meal... and it might be next week!!

Service here is fast but indifferent... but who cares?

They accepts Cash only!"}
{"text":"I usually stop by here for to grab a quick cheap lunch.
There is a small counter and table where you can grab a hot tea to go with your lunch
The selection and quality of the various BBQ meats is excellent.
I like the way the lady meat cutter is very careful in selecting a nice selection of meat for your order.

I also frequently do the take out for a cheap dinner for my family."}
{"text":"Best roast pork in town! Anyone who likes bbq and lives in the gta knows this place. Extra sauce and extra greens. 

Small place, always lineups at peak times. Be sure to go early as the roast pork can be sold out at any time. There is only one table that seats 4, the rest of the seats are against the wall/in front of the window. Theres also free tea and a microwave to heat your food.

Comes in small or large, small is plenty."}
{"text":"A very good  place for Bbq Pork and Roasted Pork.  Always nice & meaty, tender & juicy, seasoned very well - not too salty nor not too sweet, and the roasted skin nice and crispy.  

Its a little bit pricey than the food court in First Markham Place or T&T:  $6.99 per pound for Bbq Pork and $7.99 per pound for Roasted Pork, but the quality and taste are far different, too.

I usually swing by at lunch time when everything is all fresh and hot, and just out of the kitchen.  They have a good line-up of other bbq items including whole duck and chicken, poultry parts, innards, and sausages; plus rice combos when you`re on the go.  A quiet sitting place is available.

Its probably made on-site with that huge convection or roasting oven in the kitchen that sends out that fine aroma outside that almost screens out the nearby McDonalds and O-Mei Fine Chinese Restaurant.

A simple and very clean take-out hub that gets a long line of customers usually in the lunch hours so come early and be a little patient as the cutting takes a little longer with keen attention to detail, but its worth the wait.  Cash only.

Kum Hong could very well deserve a 4 star from me but the guy further down the block, John's Chinese Bbq, has something more special to offer for almost the same price.  See my review to satisfy your curiosity.  :)"}
{"text":"Best bbq pork and char siu, especially the sauce!  They're not very friendly but they are fast and tastes good!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love the BBQ food here, and especially for the cheap price. $6.50 for a medium and $7.50 for a large combo (rice + 2 choices of meat). 

There's always a large portion of rice to go with the food so you'll always be full, even on the medium sized combo. Worry not about the large abundance of rice, because the sauce they use is absolutely delicious!/

For meats, I recommend the BBQ pork and roasted pork. The roast duck is average."}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat if you are looking for something cheap, delicious, fast and filling. The small lunch combo is rice with 2 choice of meat for $6.50 and a large for $7.50. They accept cash only and there aren't many seats for dine in. I have tried their BBQ pork, roast pork, roast duck, soy chicken and sausage in the rice combo. My favourite by far is the roast pork because it's always so juicy and the skin is very crispy. I come here at least once a week for lunch before work and the quality of the meats are always consistently good. Staff working there are always friendly and quite fast with getting the orders done. I definitely recommend trying this BBQ place out."}
{"text":"Had the roast pork and duck on rice.  Value was great, tons of food at a great price, although I did find the meat a little fattier than I'd prefer."}
{"text":"I've been eating at this place for the eight years I have been in the neighbourhood. It's filling, inexpensive, and really tasty.

It is located on highway 7 in the southern most part of Richmond Hill. It's in the same plaza as McDonald's. There's lots of free parking and its at the valleymede viva stop.

They have roasted and BBQ pork, chicken, whole duck, cuttlefish, chicken feet, and lots of other food.

You can buy the meats by the pound. You can also buy a whole or half roasted pig as well, you just need to pre order.

I get the combo. There's a small and large one. It's rice, with one or two meats on it. With a sauce and ginger and scallion salsa. I get normally the chicken and BBQ pork. Tonight, the pictures are of something different.

I got the roasted pork and BBQ pork with extra roasted pork. Roasted pork was amazing. Crispy skin. Omg!!

It's pretty in expensive for the amount, and quality of the food. Cash only. 6.5 for small, 7.50 for large. 2 bucks for extra meat. Yum."}
{"text":"I have been buying their take out BBQ pork and Roasted pork for many years and never once was I disappointed. I used to live close by to here, but now I live further south so my visits are less frequent."}
