{"text":"Went in here to grab a late night bite and there was a giant hair in my plate .... the sever was rude, not only because he didn't offer to comp or replace the meal. Terrible service."}
{"text":"Any time Celine Dion is associated with something, I get sceptical. Yes, she is a Canadian icon but she's not necessarily an icon in line with my personal aspirations. So visiting her restaurant was a bit weird for me. I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised.    The clean interior was filled with early 20th century memorabilia and the staff were very helpful. Each time we went, we were treated well, seated quickly and served with a smile. The staff here were wonderful and on the basis of that alone I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them.    The food was great. In typical North American style we were served far more and anyone could ever hope to finish and we all left stuffed with wonderful diner food. This was exactly what we were looking for and it just hit the spot. Everyone in each group I went with found something they wanted from the posh to the greasy burger, from starters through to dessert.    This was a fantastic restaurant with a wide range of food on the menu and they were brilliant with us English-only speakers. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to any and all tourists (and locals!)"}
{"text":"After arriving in beautiful Montreal via rough traffic into the city, me and my lady were ready to re-explore our love for Poutine.    We started our dinner and went for the meat poutine with sausage and bacon, which was pretty average. I would've enjoyed a thicker more crispy fry, in lieu of the thin 'shoestring' they offered.    I ordered the salmon burger for my entree, in which the patty was half the size of the bun. The menu stated it came with tarter sauce, but mine arrived without. When I asked for a side of tarter sauce, the waiter came back with a pre-packaged tiny packet. I would've preferred tarter sauce that was made in-house and not bland.   The restaurant itself is a 'tourist trap' if you will, being right on Rue St. Catherine. It wasn't the cleanest diner I've been in, but it wasn't too bad either. I honestly probably won't go back, unless options are super limited and I'm twisted.   _Beantowns Finest_"}
{"text":"I don't know about other Nickel's restaurants (for example there is one Ste. Catherine street) but this one on Cote-des-Neiges is pretty ordinary. The diner decor at times looks a bit dirty, the food is bland and the prices are not that low. You could have more value for money or simply more better quality food at one of the many breakfast serving establishments in th CdN neighborhood.   I won't return or recommend it to my friends simply because their food and service are pretty ordinary and that better options are not far off ."}
{"text":"Honestly Nickel's used to be good, I remember being wowed by the food at what seemed a very decent price vis-a-vis the taste.   At one time they had delicious, home cut fries... now? Frozen shoestring.  At one time they had real thick bacon... now? I swear to God it's that pre-cooked microwave bacon garbage. Paper thin and tasteless.   At one time they had good eggs, nice and buttery... now? rubber, rubber, rubber!   At one time they had good smoked meat sandwiches (that was the whole point)... now? Omg, it's like eating Hygrade/Coorsh packets.   Who would have thought that Celine Dion leaving the business would have made the business worse (She left in 1997)?  Anyways... if you can... PASS."}
{"text":"My fiancé Sam and I went to the Nickle's restaurant located on St. Catherine street across from the Eaton Centre. We both loved the restaurant as regulars the past 4 years (we would go maybe twice a month on average before going to the movies). We both ordered Ranger Burgers (monterey jack cheese, bacon, and mesquite sauce) and a pint of Rickard's red. Our waiter provided excellent service. When the food arrived, Sam took one bite of the burger and spit it out and looked like she was going to throw up. When I asked what was wrong she said that it tasted like mould. I was surprised because my burger tasted fine, so she tried a bite of mine, and said it was fine. It was just her burger that had the problem. So we asked our waiter to take it back and get another one. He was apologetic and immediately took it away.   Five minutes later a man approached the table, made no introduction and immediately asked about the burger. Sam explained the whole story again that we already explained to the waiter the first time, and the man (who I assume was the restaurant manager) immediately suggested the problem was with her taste buds. I still remember when he said to us  \"These burgers sell like hot cakes so maybe the problem is with you? Maybe you would like something else?\". That annoyed me a bit, but he still spoke to us in a somewhat respectful manner. As she tried to explain the situation to him, I really began to feel like he didn't get her problem was only with that one burger served to her and that she normally loves the Ranger burger. Finally he said that was fine and he would bring another burger.  Less than five minutes later, another man approached the table and again made no introduction. Tip for any restaurant owners out there, when interupting two people in coversation at a restaurant table, introduce yourself. He essentially said the exact same thing the first man said, but this time in an infinitely more rude manner.   \"So what's the problem you have with the burger?\" I could see in her eyes she was already pissed off the way he approached the whole matter. She tried to explain that her burger tasted like mould and once again. He said in a very aggressive, acusational sort of way, \"Look, maybe you should get a spaghetti. Maybe burgers aren't your thing. I just don't want to serve you another burger and have you not like that one either.\" She tried to explain again it was just that one burger. She liked the taste of my burger and we ordered the same thing. It was like nothing was getting through to the man. I could see her face turning red as this man pretty much made her feel like her opinion as the customer was worthless. She finally looked away from him and back at me and said that maybe we should just leave.   At this point I felt pretty justified in causing a scene because this man essentially ruined our night. As we got up, I looked him in the eye and said \"What's your name?\" \"Jerry.\" \"And what are you? Are you the store manager or something?\" \"I'm the owner\" \"Well before we leave let me tell you something. Its not okay to talk to my fiancé like that. Apologize to her.\" He looked at her like she was an inconvenience on his day, like he really just wanted us both to fuck off.  \"Yeah well I am sorry that she didn't like the burger...\" Sam immediately rolled her eyes at his non-apology.  \"No, a real apology for ruining our night.\" I said, raising my voice because I felt like that was the only thing that would get through to this guy. \"Oh please, like I really ruined your night. I didn't ruin your night.\" Don't quite remember what happened next, as I think I went temporarily insane at his utter contempt for us as paying customers. So that was when I decided to never go back to that Nickle's again. For Jerry's sake, I really hope he learns how to speak with his customers with some respect and etiquette."}
{"text":"On en trouve un peu partout en ville et sur le bord des routes, c'est une valeur sûre si on veut bien manger pour pas cher même si un peu gras.   Ils font de bons breakfast avec du café servi en cafetière comme aux USA ;) et le décor est très américain, on s'y croirait!  Pratique et efficace."}
{"text":"Awful awful awful... to be avoided!  Slow service = 1h25m to get food. Cold food = The meat was cold  The only thing redeeming about it is being snubbed when I made a comment to the manager. It made me realize that the place was truly to be avoided. Buyer beware!"}
{"text":"This review is for breakfast only. I happened to be in the neighbourhood and came upon this kitschy diner and deli on the famous St. Catherine's street. Most breakfasts come with coffee or tea and they have early bird specials. You will find a good mix of locals and tourists dining side by side in harmony. My food was decent, service was friendly and prompt. This place is a must try!"}
{"text":"Minus 14 degrees I must admit it was the outside that really attract me in . Seat at the table in a cool environment we decide to order some entry and food ... Well beside the service being very slow I must admit the taste is still something I waiting for ... The food wasn't at the best of my expectation only the desert ... 98$ for 2 I must say it is not a given . Sangria without fruits , wrong delivery at the table versus what was ordered , and on the top of that we must give. 15% tips .... Next time Burger King ...."}
{"text":"While I would endeavour never to use the ladies washroom again, the service and the meal I had were excellent.   Sometimes you just can't beat a classic. Montreal smoked meat sandwich with fries and coleslaw. My sandwich was piled high with delicious meat, warm and juicy. By the time I finished wolfing it down, juices were running down my hand. It was excellent.  Monday to Friday, from 4pm to close, this deal is only $5. Go. Eat. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Resto a l'américaine comme on dit!  Atmosphère et ambiance super sympa entre amis ou collègues. Franchise Apparement de Celine Dion.. M'enfin a part ce détail! La carte ouvre l'appetit! Je me suis laissée tenter par une \"assiette de souvlakis\" et mon ami par \"la star\".. Et franchement c t délicieux!  Je ne reprocherai qu'une chose.. Mon assiette était tellement, mais tellement!! grande!!! que malgré ma grosse faim! Je n'ai a peine pu manger la moitié! LOL"}
{"text":"Damn you Celine Dion, get René to bring back the fresh made fries! Listen, you would have garnered four stars for the La Star meal deal, but serving frozen pommes frites doesn't cut it."}
{"text":"Everything else was closed as it was pretty late and I was looking for a quick bite to eat. It's a diner and the menu is pretty much mostly burgers and the like. However it was extensive and I opted for Chicken Souvlaki with rice, fried potatoes and salad. It came very quickly and I must say for $10 it was very nice in need. Just what I was after. It was 10:00pm so the place was mostly full of drunk kids returning from a night out on the town. Just saw that Celine Dion owns this chain :-)"}
{"text":"Have not been to a Nickels for a long time. Was shopping and we decided to go for lunch. The service was good, waiter was polite and helpful. The good was ok I had a fajitas and it was ok but not great. Way to many onion and they were cut too big. Also it was blend no seasoning not even salt. My friend had some kind of sandwich and it was the same as mine ok but missing the seasoning.   Place is ok but they might want to refresh their menu and decor looks the same from the last time I was there in 1995."}
{"text":"Not worth a single dollar. The service was the best thing. Also the best thing was water.  Food was horrible. Unfortunately Nickels has lost it !!! Never again !"}
{"text":"Decent place to eat, but definitely not amazing or anything like that.  Portions are good, and service is usually good as well.  I enjoy their beef or chicken fajitas, and have had a few salads here as well. I've found that apart from these things, all their other stuff which I have tried has been quite bland."}
{"text":"Avoid this place and if u must go and are american and jonathan is your server, walk out. Absolutly no reason to wait 10 min to be acknowledged. 20 min for our order to be taken and 40 min for it to come out just to have the chicken raw and the salad brown and slimy.  Avoid at all costs!!!!   Oh and the food poisioning from the raw chicken!!!"}
{"text":"We sat on the terrace and service is non existent. We went in to get menues. -* Than my water came in a dirty glass 10 minutes after we sit down. I almost took a sip when I realized that the glass tasted sweet and water smelled of alcohol-** I ordered a grill cheese for 10$, which called special marble grill cheese. I thought it was the good cheese but no. It was cheep processed crap but whole 3 pieces of it on a huge toast bread. Bread was marbled and old. The cheese slices barely covered the bread . -* And another minus star is that they cheaped out on butter! The toast was extremely slightly buttered, I do not believe it was real butter probably some  cheap margarine . -* The waitress never came to ask about the food or anything, nor explain special. Nothing. -* I asked for the bill and waiters finally asked how was the food. I explained my experience and she offered the grilled cheese for free"}
{"text":"I definitely did not miss the location across from Eaton's (What a disaster)  Seeing this place is new on the block, i tried their breakfast, a safe bet It was a quiet Saturday, I had my 2 eggs and sausage plate and the daily paper.  The waitress was super friendly and filled up my coffee at least 4-5 times. I didn't feel rushed or anything since it was so quiet.  The eggs were pretty big and the meal hit the spot. The decor is not as kitschy as before but still a throwback but very clean and bright.  I went back a week later to try their Big Bopper burger, with mushrooms and cheese. The burger had a nice charcoal taste to it, it came with skinny fries which were ok. A nice little bonus was some coleslaw and pickles  A very solid choice for the area, they do deliver as well, so it's on my short list. The menu is significantly cheaper than the Dunn's across the street and with a nicer and less claustrophobic interior"}
{"text":"I've been to Nickels a handful of times in my travels to Montreal... It's decor tries to recreate the feel of a '50s diner, but I noticed they play newer music through the sound system. The burgers are ok, and that's being generous. Fries aren't anything more then frozen $1 fries, you'd get at the market The waitstaff has ranged from \"Ok - Pretty Rude.\" I'd recommend it for people looking more for value over quality. Mostly I'll use it for mid-drinking-day food fill up, when I don't want McDonald's."}
{"text":"We chose this place on a Friday evening because so many others were loud and crowded. The food was very good, reasonably priced and pleasantly served."}
{"text":"Vous avez déjà très probablement mangé dans un Nickels. On en trouve un peu partout, que ce soit à Montréal ou ailleurs. Oui, mais avez-vous déjà mangé au Nickels de la rue Ste-Catherine? Si oui, alors vous savez de quoi je parle. Si non, alors vous devez absolument aller y faire un tour! Je ne sais pas pourquoi ce restaurant là est différent des autres, mais il y a définitivement quelque chose de meilleur! La déco déjà est beaucoup plus funky qu'ailleurs : les murs sont recouverts de portraits d'acteurs américains de légende et l'ensemble du mobilier ferait jurer qu'on est revenu dans les années 50. Les serveurs sont plus aimables et la nourriture elle-même est meilleure! Pourquoi? Comme se fait-ce? (J'adore cette formulation!) Quel étrange mystère! En tout cas, à défaut de l'élucider je vais me contenter d'en profiter!"}
{"text":"HAHA, this is a DINER?!?!   According to whom?   If you DON'T have taste buds and are blind, then go ahead and order.   Not only is the food bad, the service is wait...what service? I might as well have gone back to the kitchen myself n' whipped something up.   Even the touristy restaurants in Hollywood, CA, London, and Orlando, FL haven't been THIS bad.  BUT, they do get a review and a star because the store front was cute & appealing enough for me to even have gone in here.  Joke was on ME!  (I really wish it could've been a better experience, because it was at a great location- across from their \"so called\" mall.)"}
{"text":"This review is solely for the \"Elvis\" burger.  I've been going to this Nickel's for over 5 years and only to get what I consider one of the best burgers in Montreal.  The burger is big and tasty and fries delicious. The patty has such a nice flavor that I could say it was made on a charcoal grill - although i think it's not -  The place is nice, looks like a dinner from the 50s, service has always been fast and courteous.  Desserts are huge and delicious, our favorite is the classic banana split."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong in Montreal when you're look for a location with an old-school diner feel and Nickels delivers. Food was delivered fast and was good. Service was to the point and very polite. A definite for anyone looking for something good and quick."}
{"text":"I'm a little embarassed to even be writing a review about Nickels, but here goes.  We stopped in here because it was freakin' freezing and raining outside and we needed brunch - pronto!  We all ordered crepes (not pancakes as our server was quick to point out)...duh, were English, not stupid.  Anyway, we had the fruit crepes and the strawberry/nutella crepes.  I ordered a side of sausage with mine.  Food was average, crepes were a bit greasy and the strawberry nutella crepe had an obscene amount of nutella.  It was frankly a bit nauseating.  Great for a 6 year old, but not at all what I expected.  Food was reasonably price and the crepe portions sizes seemed a lot smaller than the greasier bacon/egg/potato combos."}
{"text":"I will admit that upon entering I expected a cool little Montreal diner with character...I was mistaken.  It seemed like a touristy restaurant chain with mediocre food...wait, you probably knew that.  This is a restaurant that you'd find in any suburban mall in Canada...not overly exciting, and if you are downtown in Montreal go someplace else!  On the positive side, lots of pictures of Celine Dion.    On the serious positive side though...it is a good palce for kids.  Lots of other kids, big place, and the menu is reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday morning and it wasn't that busy. The service was quick and it had nice decor for a diner. I ordered The Griddle and everything was pretty good except for the pancakes. They were very airy and as such, no substance to them.  The meal cost $10 so it was a little on the pricey side."}
{"text":"Just dont go. This place sucks. I went when I was very intoxicated the first time and the food was blah. Went totally sober for a good breakfast and the food was even worse. The fist time i got chicken fingers and fries, the chicken fingers were o-k but the worst was that they had NO sauces for the fingers......except this runny bbq sauce that was utterly disgusting. When we went for breakfast on our last day it was just so bad. I ordered your typical eggs, toast,sausage. I only got 2 small sausages, weak ass scrambled eggs and some shotty fruit. the only good part was the toast that was buttered with jam lol. Our breakfast server was awesome though but the food just sucks so hard, no wonder why they arent in toronto anymore. lol"}
{"text":"Great service, good atmosphere for families, fast delicious food. Poutine with meat is A MUST."}
{"text":"Okay - it was late at night and we decided to eat and grab one last drink before heading back to the hotel - we had limited options.  Touristy '50s-style diner pretty much sums this joint up.  Big portions and decent pricing -- my chili burger wasn't all bad and the service was alright - so this place gets a passing grade from me for this alone.  But yup - this place is pretty dirty.  I know it's the middle of winter - but that was an unusual amount of dirt/mud on the floortiles.  But this isn't why I'm giving it 2-stars.  I'm shocked I'm the first person to mention this little fact - at every table, along with your sugar packets and salt & pepper shakers, is a ginormous bottle of hand sanitizer.  What - the - fuck?  HAND SANITIZER AT EVERY TABLE?  Okay - maybe it's just me.  I went through a phase where I was using hand sanitizer every 30 minutes because my workplace installed them everywhere and I worked with some 'drrrty' people.  I'm a recovering germaphobe like Puddy.  My tablemate is a healthcare professional and was mildly annoyed at this joint is contributing to creating the supervirus.  And I don't buy the argument that it's offered as a convenience and I can just opt out.  There's a sink and soap - wash up your damned hands if you feel dirty.  Having hand sanitizer at the table is not a good look.  It's like if you came over to my place and you found Preparation H and Summer's Eve on the bathroom counter - you would assume I have hemorrhoids and/or a smelly vagina, right?   Or that I should really reconsider my time machine schematics.  Not a good look, do people really not wash their hands?  I woke up the next morning wondering why the hell I had taken a picture of hand sanitizer as well.  Once again - what - the - fuck?  Finally, Nickels - having a picture up of Celine Dion doesn't boost foot traffic nor whet appetites - it has the opposite effect."}
{"text":"First review for this location in over 2 years. We sat in the dinning room and had a poutine and a burger over a pitcher of beer before a Laval Rockets game. Burger was burnt, poutine was fine. Dishes took long enough to come to the table that we didn't have time to get the burger situation rectified. The fries are great though. Service was friendly despite being inattentive. Wasn't a $60 meal. I would suggest taking advantage of happy hour specials in the bar section and snacks before a game at Place Bell."}
{"text":"Better than expected. Cheap. Fun. Good. Get tipsy before your movie and bring a date. Don't expect the royal treatment and get over yourself. Decent calamari and very huge sandwich/wrap portions. Overall, a very good value."}
{"text":"Came here at 1am right when we arrived in Montreal Service wasn't too bad but the tables were a bit filthy as there was still left over fries on the table Typically food of what you would get at dennys Ordered the chili poutine which was basically chili cheese fries and the smoked meat sandwich Overall good portions  I say best to come here when ur starving in the middle of the night but during the day there's better restaurants beside like reubens"}
{"text":"Came in here for lunch today and although I was seated promptly, the service was very very slow and it was hard to get a server's attention. I had decided what I wanted to order and still no one was coming around to take my order until it got down to me staring at the waitstaff. I wound up ordering their smoked meat spaghetti which was being advertised. It was good although I'm not crazy about smoked meat but I figured I'd try it anyways. The other thing that sadly has landed this review down to two stars is the price. For what I had, the price was a little steep for my liking and refills on my soda weren't free which I suppose I should have thought to ask. Anyways, I may or may not come back depending on who I'm with..but I probably won't if I'm on my own like I was today."}
{"text":"My father and I used to breakfast there when I was young and I still hold fond memories of it. I recently went back with my parents, for old times' sake and unfortunately it didn't hold up to my expectations.. This sort of kitschy joint was bought (or whatever) by our very own queen of Kitsch: Celine Dion, and you have pictures of her (or used to anyway) everywhere, surrounded by black and white glamorous movie stars from the fifties.  I love the squeaky, glittery seats and the bubblegum, retro decor but it's all that remains. The portions, once humongous, are now merely normal. I guess they want to appeal to a more health conscious clientele but, damn, that's not what I'm here for! I don't think the flashy jukebox plays anymore and my favorites from the desert menu (the \"Celine Dion\"! of course, the incredible Banana Split and and giant Sundae) are gone and I'm heartbroken.."}
{"text":"Only gave them one star because you can't give them zero. Went there this morning for breakfast, never actually got any food. After waiting for ten minutes without anyone acknowledging we were seated I asked if someone was going to take our order. The guy kind of nodded.  After another five minutes I was done.  We left and went to Reuben's down the street. Very good food and good service. They wanted my money I guess."}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY DO NOT recommend coming to this restaurant.   Went in to grab lunch and my girlfriend discovered a small strand of hair in her plate. Asked the waitress about why there was hair in her plate and the waitress just denied that it was hers. The waitress also blamed the hair to be my girlfriend's but it clearly didn't belong to my girlfriend's as she has long hair. She didn't offer anything for us to, not even to replace the meal. When paying the bill I did not tip due to a strand of hair in our food and the terrible service. The waitress noticed we did not tip and yelled out \"okay enjoy your money\".  Service was slow and terrible. Without a doubt avoid this place. Would never step in this place again."}
{"text":"(Original posting was 1 Feb 2009 during my birthday weekend in Montreal.)  Nickels was our last restaurant stop on rue St. Catherine in Downtown Montreal before heading back to our hotel to pack for our flight back to LAX. By this time, it was already 2am and a lot of places weren't open. =( The way I would describe this place is more like an upscale Denny's? Hahaha...great music selections, too! They played \"Everybody was kung-fu fighting...HAH!\"  We ordered the lightly fried calamari (9.49 CAD), smoked meat pizza (12.39 CAD) and shrimp brochette (11.99 CAD).  Objectively, this place will do when you're starving at 2 in the morning.  The calamari was good but the smoked meat pizza was a little oily and when I asked for thin crust, they mean it, literally so take my word for it.  The shrimp brochette (skewers) came in two sticks with rice and a side salad.  Overall I was satisfied, but I think my immense hunger overcame my usual picky-ness."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Nickels since it's popularity waned in the late 90ies. A few coworkers and I decided to try it out.  The menu had a lot of options but I went with their deli smoked meat sandwich and fries. If the drink was a free refill, I wouldn't know because the service was lousy to say the least. We waited nearly 20 minutes to place our orders and for lunch, that's inexcusable. As we waited other patrons complained to the waitress about their meals. Solid start.  The smoked meat was about average and with local options being way above this, they didn't impress me much. The fries were excellent however.  All in all, wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE!  Foods is gross, Service is terrible.  We came here expecting some hot and delicious breakfast! It was probably the worst breakfast ever lol   Rude waitress, Paper bacon, plastic eggs, cardboard pancakes, water syrup etc...  Why is this diner even in business??"}
{"text":"Had a nice breakfast. Service was friendly and no complaints. Food was typical diner food. Yummy but did not overly wow me."}
{"text":"Pretty basic meals. Do not expect a gourmet experience. You might not want to return again. The special red potato fries are blend and the cold slaw is below average.  The service is however fast on lunchtime and I can't argue you on the kindness of the waiter.  Unfortunately, I am not coming back again."}
{"text":"A nice place with an all-around good menu. I've become something of a regular customer and nothing that I've had has been bad. Particular favourites are the club sandwich ($10.99 with real chicken breast, not sliced!), the smoked meat (on special 2 for 1 on Tuesdays), and the Jimmy Dean. The pork souvlaki platter holds up well under scrutiny. I wasn't big on their quarter chicken, but it wasn't bad -- besides, if you want chicken, there's a St-Hubert across the street.  The service is usually quite prompt, the washrooms are always clean, the food is consistently well-prepared. Not an especially fancy joint, but a solid choice for a casual meal out."}
{"text":"I've been to many nicks and this was the worst one by far. I don't get how the chef can be so lazy as to not season the potatoes or cut them so that they end up in horrable looking chunks. Eggs were over cooked some how, very disappointed!! Don't come here for breakfast ever."}
{"text":"Chicken: good,  Ribs: good,  Fries: good,  Service: friendly, fast and on time,  Damage: CAD $ 22.98 ."}
