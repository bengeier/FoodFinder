{"text":"This little gem in the Calgary Farmers Market makes great chili, but my favourite is their Rosemary Chicken Panini (ask for spicy - you won't regret it). When you order their sandwiches or paninis, you also get a side of fruit. They are a deli, so in addition to getting lunch, you can buy deli meats, cheeses, a myriad of sauces, and they also sell Cows Creamery Butter from PEI - which is 84% butter fat instead of 80% like most Canadian butter. 84% is the standard baking butter in Europe - and very hard to find in Canada."}
{"text":"I give this place a 3.5 actually. Originally located in the Farmer's market, they have a location now on Stephen Ave. Because of various catering functions we've used them for, as well as going there with co workers, I've been able to sample various foods they offer.
I think the best value at this place is their sandwiches, and they have many specialty choices on offer as well. Things I haven't seen elsewhere (eg; spanish pan) It comes in a little box with some chips and sometimes a cookie. For $8.50 this is one of the best quick lunch options on this side of downtown, and it's filling portions. Their orzo and bean salads are great. They have a great selection of desserts (although most are super sweet). The only issue I have is the other items they have - they're a grocery store as well - are SUPER expensive! Stick to the sandwich/salad/dessert here, they're great."}
{"text":"Maybe it's the fact that I haven't purchased a deli made sandwich in a couple of months, but I just came across a sandwich that put a rip in the space-time continuum. Deli-cious, this little place across from Divino's on Stephen Ave, has completely altered the way I look at a sandwich. The game-changer is a Harvest Turkey Apple Cheese Sandwich. With it's Brezain Feux De Bois Cheese and Blueberry (that's right) Mayo, it's very description evokes a Pavlov response that turns me into a zombie transfixed on my thirst for Blueberry Mayo. The smokiness of the De Bois mixed with pure fruit at first scared me. I know of nobody in my circle of friends that smoke fruit or fruit smoke. However, upon analysis why couldn't these flavours work together, I love smokies and I love fruit...ies.
 
Sometimes when the full moon is out and the stars align just right, Deli-cious runs out of apples. Their solution is to turn a negative situation into a positive. They replace apples with strawberries. Now realize that this is equivalent to someone saying sorry you didn't win $2 on this lotto scratch ticket you won $5. It is my opinion that the strawberries are superb with this sandwich combination. I would go even further saying that they should consider replacing the apples with strawberries from here on in. But both are satisfying.

The sandwich comes with chips and pickles, both fine appetizers and finishers. Total cost ...a mere $8.50 + tax. We need more places like this on Stephen Ave. Affordable, down to earth and satisfying.
