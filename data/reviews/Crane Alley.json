{"text":"After waiting 45 minutes to be seated we were told the kitchen is shut down and won't allow any more customers to be seated. We were forced to leave a find somewhere else to eat. I do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Crane Alley is wonderful!  They have a very extensive beer list, friendly staff, yummy food, pool tables and a great beer garden in the adjacent alley.  Crane alley is a good place for after work cocktails, lunch, dinner and just hangin' out.    The Fine Young Cannibal reccomends the beet chips and black bean burger!"}
{"text":"I love Crane Alley! They have a great selection of sandwiches at reasonable prices, and the best beer selection in town. I find the Friday/Saturday specials are always creative and amazing. You can't go wrong with the frequently offered Beef Ragout Nachos (but bring 2-3 people to help you finish!). Seating outside is quite pleasant, except then you miss interacting with the friendly bartenders inside. The service is friendly, with just the right amount of attentiveness, and they are nice to our dogs."}
{"text":"This was my go-to place when I lived in Urbana.  Can't beat the beer/food/billiards combo.  Excellent beer selection with large number of rotating brews on tap.  Food is pretty good...I've had a few so-so experiences, but generally I am very pleased."}
{"text":"In the summer you can sit at outdoor tables in the alley. I love that you can sit outside with your dog. They even bring out a bowl of water for your pup. This coupled with the draft beers makes it one of my favorites.  They have a huge selection of beers and rotation of drafts. The drink menu is like a small novel. If you can't decide the servers/bartenders are knowledgeable and will help you make a choice.     I have ordered food here a couple of times and was amazed at how good everything was."}
{"text":"Love Crane Alley ----  Huge selection of beers and they make excellent cocktails. The atmosphere is mellow and causal and in nice weather, there is great seating outside. 3 pool tables in the main floor along with a long bar and plenty of seating.   The food is surprisingly excellent bar fare. I was expecting the food to be okay and was pleasantly surprised. I frequent Crane Alley every week and my favorites are their burgers and their fish sandwich!  They are a bit pricey but for what you get in terms of quality and atmosphere I think it is a good deal."}
{"text":"Mushroom and Spinach Lasagna with Cream Sauce- The noodles were nice and thin, the Alfredo-style bechamel flavorful- this was a nice surprise. A bit pricy though..  Chicken Parm- Had a weird pepperoncini sauce on top that subtracted from the dish. The marinara was not as good as the lasagna's alfredo. The breaded chicken breast was crispy and cooked to perfection.  Buffalo Chicken Sandwich- very good- HUGE portion. I prefer to get the Buffalo sauce and ranch (can't have blue cheese while pregnant) on the side and dip- otherwise the breading gets soggy. Chicken is very well cooked.   Italian Roast Beef- the beef used was too lean- it was dry and chewy. Would benefit from using ribeye (like on a good Philly cheesesteak) or a well braised chuck roast that has enough fat to keep the meat tender. The au jus was not very flavorful- tasted mostly like oil + red pepper flakes.   Nice beer list- they have beer dinners, ($65 or $75), but they wont' discount the ticket if you are unable to drink alcohol (e.g. pregnant me)- otherwise my husband and I would have loved to have gone to one."}
{"text":"I'm not usually at Crane for food but eat there occasionally & enjoy whatever I order. The drink selection is exceptional, especially beers. The drafts are rotated frequently & are a little pricey but not unexpectedly so. Overall, a great place for a couple beers on the patio!"}
{"text":"We came last night with a group of 7.  We were told the wait was 25 minutes, but we were not seated for 40 minutes.  After we ordered our meals it took 50 minutes before we were served.  The food was excellent, but we only saw our waitress 3 times during our entire stay and we were not informed of the length of time our dinner would take.  We would have ordered appetizers had we known it would be almost an hour before we would get our food.  Great food, poor service, good atmosphere, but not worth the wait."}
{"text":"I used to really like to eat here, but the menu never changes, it has few vegetarian options, and the quality is inconsistent. They also stopped having onion rings, which made me sad. The service is usually quite good, though, and they have an awesome, always changing beer list. Unfortunately it can be quite loud and crowded on weekend evenings, so it is awkward place to try to go with a group of friends."}
{"text":"This might be the only place in C-U where they charge you a $15 fee for bringing your own birthday cake, which includes some plates and forks, no song or any other special treatment beyond that.. Still, the food is really good so go, but not for a birthday celebration if you're planning on bringing a cake."}
{"text":"Always a 11/10 for food, friendly staff, great service, and awesome atmosphere! The war pig and sweet potato fries are my go-to meal with one of the many excellent options from the beverage list--which is quite extensive btw! (By far one of the best, if not the best, in town). Today (St. Patrick's Day), they had a St. Patrick's Day menu. I had a Moylan's Dragoon Dry Irish stout paired with their Welsh rarebit. Perfect combo!"}
{"text":"The menu certainly not what we expected, we thought it was going to be bar food but it impressed instead. For the price it was above average but not amazing. Service was great. Ambience is hip. Bar was nice with their selection of beer. I'd go again!"}
{"text":"The beer selection is excellent and I love the alley seating during the summer. However, their food is underwhelming. The steak frittes are pretty much the only thing I actually enjoy on the menu. Who wouldn't love French fries w/ hangar stack and garlic parmesan butter? PSA: AVOID the wings, they are the definition of awful."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner.  Front room has a long bar and a few billiard tables.  Back room has seating for diners.  We were seated right away.  Large selection of microbrews by the bottle.  Crowd a mixture of families and students.  Enjoyed the hummus dip to start .  We had sandwiches. I had a turkey reuben and the others had burgers.  Solid, comfort food type dining."}
{"text":"Love the selection of draft beer! Super friendly wait staff even when they're packed. Very knowledgable bartenders that can help you select the perfect beverage for your taste buds! Love the outdoor seating for enjoying a light breeze with a burger and a beer. Thanks for the good times yall!"}
{"text":"So, overall, the food here I've had has been really good. I will say though that if you go to Crane Alley, it's not as cheap as some of the other area restaurants (esp. not the alcohol). Another thing my friends and I noticed is that if you get appetizers, they normally give you way more dipping material (hummus, spinach and artichoke dip, etc.) than you can use up with the pita provided. You will get charged extra if you ask for more pita.  They always have a nice selection of beverages, particularly beers, but there's a cocktail list as well (again, just plan on it being pricey). If fresh and local is important to you, they also sometimes have menu items made from products of sellers you might see at Market at the Square in the summer. In the end, it's a great place to go when the weather is nice and you can sit outside in the evening with your friends in the actual alley part of Crane Alley."}
{"text":"Pretty solid beer selection, nice waitstaff, average food. Once a month beer club meetings"}
{"text":"Personally, I have greatly enjoyed all of my trips to Crane Alley. There's plenty of options for vegetarians. My favorite appetizers are the hummus which is served with warm pita bread and the sweet potato fries which are dusted with brown sugar and served with barbecue sauce. Both are to die for!  The beer selection is great and I enjoy the cocktails as well. Overall, it is a great place for happy hour, dinner, or for hanging out and shooting pool."}
{"text":"You will not find hoards of undergraduates here, it might even be hard to find more than a few grad students.  And yet it has one of the best beer selections in town, a restaurant, and 4 full-sized pool tables.  Drinking beer and playing pool is probably one of my favorite ways to hang out, and this is the perfect place for it.  I don't know if I should let this get out much, but wednesday is half off pool night ... I played with 3 other people last week for a couple of hours and they charged us only $1.50 each! That's ridiculous.   It's also not loud at all for a bar, they have outdoor seating in the ... alley .... when it's warm, and the background music is usually a pleasant mix of classic rock.  About the restaurant, don't go here during off hours (not dinner), I don't think the regular kitchen is working or something is off.  I wish they had a few cheaper, more suited to a bar kind of appetizers than they do, especially since their above average overall food quality would make fantastic late night snacks.  The guyfriends manage and are usually hungry enough to eat entire sandwiches and meals by the end of the night, so they don't complain."}
{"text":"Have been here with large groups for either drinks, food, or both. The staff here is always really attentive. The food is pretty good and the drink selection is big. A bit pricey, but still one of my favorite places."}
{"text":"Crane Alley is by far the best Urbana bar. Well, okay, maybe that's not saying much, but this place does stand on its merits. It's equal parts restaurant and bar; you can get a drink or a meal whether you're at a table or the bar. There are also a couple of pool tables across from the bar, and when it's warm out you can sit at a table in the eponymous alley next to the bar. (Do this at night--it can feel downright romantic beneath the strings of little lightbulbs.)  Crane Alley has an excellent beer selection. They always have a dozen or so good ones on tap, and the bartenders and servers are knowledgeable enough to give recommendations. (I think they do beer tastings and whiskey tastings, although I've never been.) The liquor selection is good, with an emphasis on whiskey, and there are a couple of menu pages dedicated to sweet cocktails. I usually ordered beer here but the few mixed drinks I had were well-made.  Food-wise, they serve burgers, pasta, steaks, and appetizers. I was an especially big fan of the Portobello mushroom sandwich (a burger-type sandwich with a mushroom instead of meat, and roasted red pepper, feta, and pesto) and the potato pancakes (a decently-sized appetizer that comes with asparagus and a tasty cream sauce). My only complaint about this place is that some of the meals feel overpriced--my friend ordered the hanger steak once and it was not $16 worth of steak. Oh, and I wish they had kept the beet chips on the menu; paired with a goat cream cheese for dipping, they were awesome, but they disappeared from the menu sometime last year.  Downtown Urbana actually has a handful of restaurants and bars, but for whatever reason most of them feel like exclusively townie haunts. Crane Alley and Black Dog are the two exceptions, and unless you're specifically in the mood for barbecue and are willing to wait an hour for a table at Black Dog, Crane Alley is the place to go. It's too far from campus for the undergrads, so it's usually a mix of grad students and professionals. You can eat a burger at the bar, you can grab a beer and play pool, or you can treat your date to fancy cocktails and a nice dinner in the upstairs loft. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Best place in Central Illinois for beer selection. Cannot be topped. Solid food too, but the real reason to go here is if one covets craft brews. Staff are friendly as hell, bartenders knowledgeable, and prices aren't too bad. Thumbs up. A must hit for connoisseurs."}
{"text":"This is probably the best Urbana bar! Classy, good food, and drinks to go around! Last time I tried the pesto chicken sandwich and sweet potato fries and it was pretty decent and filling"}
{"text":"Huge draft beer selection. Great fish sandwich. Great sweet potato fries. Nachos/chili was so/so. Will come back for Backwoods BBQ on 11/15/15"}
{"text":"My favorite place in town.  I started going there because I live close by.  The food is excellent - slightly creative pub style.  Excellent beer selection - rotating taps mean you'll always find something new.  Waitstaff seem to have been turning over a lot lately, which can lead to inconsistent service.  Usually good, though."}
{"text":"This place used to be my favorite place in Urbana, followed closely by the Office.  Well, now the Office is closed, and I feel like Crane Alley is shell of what it used to be.  In fact, I never go out in Urbana anymore.  One star for serving food all night, and one star for never being too crowded and loud.  If I only have expectations to hang out with friends at night, I'm not disappointed.    I loved the food about 3 - 6 years ago, but recently, the food quality has declined and the service is horrible.  We met up with friends there, they had been there for about an hour.  Let's just say we got our food before their order was taken.  We were at adjacent tables outside.  At lunchtime.  Bad.  Why the third star?  This is where my boyfriend and I went on our first date over three years ago.  Obviously, it was a good date."}
{"text":"Great draft beer selection. Try the Blackened Tuna on Pita Bread.  It was perfectly done, seared rare."}
{"text":"You wouldn't expect to find great food at a place where it looks like Fast Eddie and Minnesota Fats could walk through the door for a game of pool at any time, but you'd be wrong. The hall just feels old and dark, but they warm it up with hot food. I had a roast beef au jus and was satisfied. They have a strong beer selection and quick staff; so I'll try it again next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I went here not long after it opened a few years back and the food was great.  On the expensive side for bar food, but great.  I would stop in every now and again, but not very frequently due to the prices.  The last time I went was about 5 months ago.  I don't know what happened, but the food was TERRIBLE!  I had butternut squash ravioli in a cream sauce and it was just awful.  No flavor, completely devoid of seasoning and the \"sauce\" may have been the Elmer's paste that comes in the little tubs with the brush attached to the cap.  It was actually grey in color.  Gross.  My husband had a chicken sandwich and it was small, cold, and cost about three times what he'd have paid for the exact same sandwich (quality wise) from McDonald's.  The evening set us back about 60 bucks for a salad, appetizer, two entrees and two draft beers, which is pricey for CU.  So not worth it.  We have no plans to go back."}
{"text":"I eat here semi-frequently because there is a lack of mid-range priced restaurants in town that aren't thai, chinese, korean etc., and this has some meals that I would classify as mid-range in price, i.e., about $8 for a meal plus tip and tax. I think the food is ok, but some of the stuff on the menu is just overpriced."}
{"text":"Many great revolving beers on tap and a delish black-bean burger. Play pool inside or sit outside -- I love this joint."}
{"text":"Excellent quality bar food plus the more elevated stuff is good too. Good sized beer menu. Definitely my favorite place in Champaign-Urbana for outdoor dining and drinking.   My favorites: Turkey pita, sweet potato fries, whatever the \"special\" hamburger is"}
{"text":"Fantastic from the second I walked in. Beer selection great. The menu is a cornucopia of items.  A must see over in these parts."}
{"text":"I occasionally eat at Crane Alley and am reasonably satisfied with it. However, tonight I stopped in for a quick beer with my husband and was caught off guard by the poor, if not downright bizarre service.   I ordered a draft session IPA described on the menu as bursting with citrus hops, or something similar to that. What I got was almost completely flavorless and we both thought it tasted a bit on the flat side. I almost never return a drink, but after taking a few sips, I went up to the bar and just expressed my concern that it might be flat because it wasn't at all as described.   Our waiter tasted it and said it seemed normal to him and that it wasn't a flavorful beer, and another server standing nearby just dismissively added that session beers aren't going to be flavorful. Um, thanks for the tip, but  I've been drinking craft beers for many years, and some session ales are indeed robust, and more to the point this one in particular was advertised as such. He was polite and there was nothing heated about the exchange, but I wasn't offered a replacement--shocking since that's standard practice in the service industry when someone isn't satisfied with a beverage.   I returned to our table and a short time later when he checked on us, he did apologize that I didn't like the beer and asked if he could do anything for me. When I suggested he get me something different (I had consumed 1/3 of the beer at most by this point), he said he couldn't do it without charging me for a second beer. Are you kidding me? Why did you ask what you could do for me then?   He seemed like a nice kid, but in all my years of being in bars and coffee shops all over Chambana and Chicago, and working in the service industry myself, I've never experienced or witnessed a response like this. If someone is unhappy with their beverage, you get them something else, no questions asked. Go to Sipyard or BarM, where customer service is standard."}
{"text":"When I lived in Urbana, Crane Alley was one of the decent places to go out.  We knew that we wouldn't be hit on by drunken freshman who would be inclined to invite us back to their dorm.    Sit outside in the cute alleyway with a cold Strongbow cider and enjoy life.  You won't regret it."}
{"text":"great burgers and great beers!!!  Even though this place is close to the campus, its far enough a way from the regular places the kids go so that is not too loud and rambunctious even on St. Paddy's Day.    The Burger really was absolutely great, even cooked to Medium- Well, it was so juicy that the first bite left a puddle of flavor on the plate....oh yeah...which then got soaked up by their great french fries.    AND they have Rouge's Kell's Irish Lager on Tap and man is that tasty....  Great service too and the prices were just right..."}
{"text":"Meh. I have given them three tries and it's just not that good. I have a hard time believing the bland hummus has won awards. The Niçoise salad lacks tuna. The veggie burger was blah. The service is slow, but passably friendly. Crane Alley is just mediocre, overpriced bar food."}
{"text":"I want to love it but can't quite yet.  Pros:  Beer Selection -- Extensive tap and bottle list. I've had the opportunity to try some great beers here (including BCBS and KBS). You can order flights of beer (four 5 ounce pours) if you want to try several beers.  Ingredients --- locally sourced food, everything has always tasted fresh. I enjoy the lunch half and half option with the garden salad and soup du jour. The vinaigrette dressing is tasty.   Cons:  Price -- a little hefty compared to other restaurants in town. A beer will typically cost $7 - $8. A sandwich at lunch is around $11-$13.   I would definitely recommend bar service if you have a small party. Service is much faster!"}
{"text":"I had the hanger steak. In my 22 years of life, I've never been more dissapointed by a meal. Perhaps I shouldn't have gone to Crane Alley hungry. The portion size for the beef was laughable at $18. The suace was bland. The side of asparagus was fine. The garlic mashed potatoes were decently good. My friends got sandwiches at half the cost and I was definitely envious. My favorite part about dining out tonight was watching my friends eat their meals."}
{"text":"my opinion of the food remains the same.  it's okay.  seems fresh.  still costs more than it should.    however.  wait service.  yikes.  it's never been great... but my experience last night was not awesome.  i was waited on by a guy with a deep v and plenty of chest hair.  he seemed put out by everything... and not in the slightest hurry to do anything.  refill drinks.  take orders.  smile.    my party wasn't ready to order when we first arrived.  we ordered drinks and an appetizer.  we brought it and plunked it down on the table, not saying a word.  he didn't return to our table for over 20 minutes.  in other words... a long ass time.  when we finally ordered, it took a long time to come out of the kitchen.  i could understand if it were busy.  but it wasn't.  there were four tables sitting outside and only one other table inside sitting beside my party of three.  a couple of guys at the bar.    i have had a lot of \"meh\" experiences at crane alley... and really... for the food, it's just not worth it.    smile deep v guy!  seriously!  if you're gonna be slow, at least be gracious. people love the affable slow poke.  too cool for school and slow never won popularity contests."}
{"text":"First time at this place. It was starting to get busy and loud near the bar area. We got seated near the back. They have a small gluten free menu, all you have to do is ask. I got BBQ salmon with sautéed veg and garlic mashed potato. It was fresh and delicious and well presented. My wife got a side salad with a cup of soup which was ham, chicken and corn chowder. Service was great and our server was a delight, will definitely be back. Great location in downtown Urbana."}
{"text":"Large beer selection but subpar food. Waiter was great and acted like he cared. Ordered the pretzel bites and chips and salsa. Salsa was not great and has a tomato paste texture. When we told the waiter we were not a fan, he took the salsa off and gave us hummus and didn't charge us for it. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"Had about 10 meals here over the years. Glad they are in Downtown Urbana. Great people work here. Good Good Good drink selection/beer/booze. I have not strayed to far from my faves, so I can not really give a fair array of menu reviews here. That said, what I have had, I adore."}
{"text":"I had lunch with a friend at Crane Alley yesterday. I'd never been there but had heard mostly good things. I'm going to agree with that assessment: mostly good! I had the portobello sandwich, with peppers and a nice pesto topping. I was sort of disappointed when my friend said she wasn't into beet chips as an appetizer, but completely excited when I saw I could substitute my fries for beet chips! Yay! We ended up sharing the spinach and artichoke dip app. It came with toasted pita slices. Mmmmm. The food was interesting, and it was good. It wasn't fantastic, or mind-blowing, but it was solid, and the menu had a good variety of selections.  The price wasn't super cheap, but it wasn't outrageous for lunch. My sandwich (plus beet chips, which do carry a surcharge as a substitution), my friend's entree (a bowl of the soup of the day and a Reuben), one soft drink and our appetizer = 28.79 before tip.  The drink menu is HUGE! I'd love to come back for dinner and drinks sometime. The ambiance screams \"You're in a bar!!\" which considering that, hey! you're in a bar, that works. It was cozy, the lighting was low, the booths black - might be a nice place for a casual date.  The one aspect that shone above all was the service. Our waiter was FANTASTIC. He was knowledgeable about the menu, helpful without being pushy or overbearing, very attentive, we had regular drink refills but he didn't make it hard for us to continue our conversation. He even brought us an assortment of to-go containers so we could keep the dip and pita chips separate - what a guy! That waiter deserves five stars (and a large tip)!"}
{"text":"I have come here twice now and I really enjoy. I usually get their champagne salad that comes with apples, brie cheese and a champagne vinaigrette. It is such a refreshing and filling salad. I have also had their pretzel bites which are incredible as well. I have never sat in the back upstairs which I would prefer to do because I am not a fan of the bar high tops. I think their menu is a little too fancy for the atmosphere and a little too pricy for it as well. However, I will continue to return."}
{"text":"I like the beer selection, but we went there for a birthday party (where I brought a cake) and they wanted to charge me a $5 plate fee. It was so absurd...we had all  bought dinner, a bottle of wine, etc. It seems like they don't want groups to converge there. I'll go somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"Bartender is super friendly. Dan is amazing. Great selection of beer and food. Best parking is coin meters."}
{"text":"This place is my main go-to to drink great beer.  Every single person on the wait staff is friendly and knowledgeable about the beers.  I'm always looking for a good recommendation, and the draft list changes so often that I rarely have a hard time choosing something new.  The artichoke dip and the special nachos are a must!"}
{"text":"Chicken Marsala.  ALWAYS good and always consistent.  Love the margaritas too."}
{"text":"Crane Alley rocks! Drinks are are strong and the food is great. We had the Italian beef and Reuben and both were solid. The wait for a Friday night wasn't too bad- about a twenty minute wait for a table, but we grabbed a drink and a couple seats at the bar while we waited. Atmosphere was lively and staff was great!"}
{"text":"One word. \"Meh.\"  My wife and I checked this place out for lunch while in town. A friend recommended the Black Dog, but it was just too crowded, so we stumbled upon this place.   The atmosphere is definitely more setup for more of the late-night get drunk and rowdy crew. Not holding that against them. Great beer selection - which made us excited for the overall experience, but would be disappointed.   While we were there, it appeared that about half the occupants of a local trailer park decided they wanted to bring all their kids to the bar at lunch time. These people were loud and obnoxious, and their kids treated the place like a playground. I was disappointed that staff made no attempted to settle the situation down... even a \"Hey, no running and screaming in bar.\" may have sufficed.  Anyway, my wife had the steak sandwich and I had the Italian beef... both pretty much had zero taste. It wasn't bad by any means, but the food quality wasn't anywhere near what the presentation promised.  Like I said... just plain \"meh.\" We would not return the next time we're in town."}
{"text":"i'd give this place 5 stars, but there's this dude named stern who always goes there.  JEEZUZ!"}
{"text":"I was in town for a graduate event, and this was a great local spot for dinner. They have great craft beers, good food, and AMAZING service. Dani was an outstanding waitress who was kind and attentive but not overbearing. I will definitely be visiting Crane Alley on my next visit to Urbana!"}
{"text":"Nothing worth going back for...except for the beer which was fantastic.  Food made me think of glorified leftovers and overpriced at that.  I had the steak sandwich and was very underwhelmed.  It came on two pieces of what tasted like wonderbread and the gondolza(sp) was almost nonexistent.  Great atmosphere and our waitress was very attentive.  Don't think I'll be back for the food though."}
{"text":"PROS: Great drinks, friendly service, fun busy atmosphere, interesting large menu (my favs are the mediterranean style Mezze plate and the Falafel sandwich, both of which are pretty rare to find around here), great specials, reasonable prices, good healthy options. CONS: Booth area is slightly odd in terms of interior design - I wish they would revamp it and make it less claustrophobic somehow..."}
{"text":"They have a fantastic beer list and the food is very good although pricey for what you get. The service is the reason for my low score. If not for the weak service, I would give the restaurant either a 3 or 4. I went and ordered a beer that the menu stated was 12 ounces. The glass it was brought in was clearly not 12 ounces. When I brought it to the waitresses attention, she argued the point. Finally, we were able to demonstrate that the beer really was less than 12 ounces and she took $1 off the price of the bill. I prefer restaurants who take their customers more seriously than this."}
{"text":"Crane Alley has a nice selection of reasonably priced beers. However, I have just had the worst (ever) Cobb salad at Crane Alley.  Generally, a decent Cobb salad has several - 4 or 5 nice toppings (~1/4 cup of ham, ~1/4 cup of aged cheddar, ~1/4 cup of blue cheese, ~1/4 of crumbled bacon, etc.) with a few other minor toppings. This salad had one hard boiled egg (quartered), ~3 cherry tomatoes (in halves), a teaspoon of bacon bits, a tablespoon of blue cheese and a few slices of avacado (and that was it for toppings!). Theoretically, it had raspberry vinagrette dressing, at least that is what the menu stated (although I could not taste any). They did pile on the lettuce. For $6, it would have been an acceptable side salad, but for $11 it was a terrible Cobb salad. My wife had a Reuben, that was the perfect size for an 8 year old child. While the beer options are nice, there are far better places to eat in both Champaign and Urbana. "}
{"text":"If you like beer then this place is for you. No really, if you like beer you should come here. Now.   This place features all kinds of local beers from the IL area in addition to featuring a ton of other great microbrews from across the country. I wouldn't come here in a rush because you need some time to actually read through all of their beer selections there are that many! It is a mini binder, so come ready to read about beer, taste beer, and enjoy beer, and then maybe even play a little pool (until the pool league comes in that is, since they have a league here a few days a week!).   They also have beer samplers and I have to say that Matt J. and I were very impressed with our bar tender in that she not only remembered the 10 different beers we ordered, but then recited them back in order in increasing light to dark beers as well. Amazing. That is the type of bar tender at a great beer place that you want. So hat's off to her!   The food looked pretty good here too and everyone here just seemed happy in general. It is a darker bar restaurant on the inside so good for group outings or dates I would say, but if you don't like beer, you will be missing the main draw of this place!"}
{"text":"Ate here on a whim one night when Black Dog Smoke House was packed and really enjoyed it. I've been here three times now with different people. Best piece of advice for ordering food: avoid the pastas, get the burgers, mezzo plate, or tacos (when on special). The pastas I've had or others with me have had were not that great, but the \"pub food\" is interesting and done right. Plus, you cannot beat the beer selection and their prices are fair. Service is always fast, even if they're crowded."}
{"text":"Great menu and great food....however VERY pricey!!! Ordered 2 small potato pancakes that were very tasty and 2 martinis and my bill was $32 plus tax and tip...service was great... But the experience was not worth $38!!! Will not go back anytime soon!!"}
{"text":"A particularly long wait when the place wasn't packed and seemed adequately staffed. The icing on top was being served a seared but still raw burger after asking it be cooked well done. Completely disappointed with the entire experience."}
{"text":"we came here for dinner on a Saturday evening, and while busy, we were able to be seated right away. Service was ok, but maybe a little fragmented. Their beer selection was decent. I ordered a heavy stout (10%ABV) which they served to me in a pint glass. HOLY COW was that a lot of deliciously strong beer to take on. My point is, I'm used to higher content beers being served in a smaller glass (I wasn't complaining though because I wasn't driving!), so be careful.  I had a burger and upgraded to sweet potato fries. The food was good. The burger was juicy, but not super intense on flavor overall. I've had better, but easily devoured this. I'd definitely be up to return in the future."}
{"text":"Servers are wonderfully friendly, there are approximately 8,974 beers available*, the drink selection is broad and the bar is huge, and several of the sandwiches and appetizers are delicious.  When your'e there, do try the potato pancakes in a light cheese/cream sauce.  OMG, it tastes like magic.     *i might be exaggerating, but only slightly."}
{"text":"im sad to see that this place has been getting such bad reviews.  this was my favorite place to eat when i lived in champaign.  i have not been there in at least 6 months, so i am rating it on my past experiences. i have had so many awesome dinners here.  and i like the beer selection.  im gonna return next time im in town to see if its really as bad as these reviews say."}
{"text":"Each time I've been here has been great. Two of those were Oktoberfest and the German food was quite good for central Illinois and they had a number of Oktoberfest drafts in a trailer out back. For regular lunch, I've always been impressed by the quality and quantity of food. The beer selection is one of the best in town."}
{"text":"I just really love this place. The beer selection is fantastic. The food is surprisingly good.. The service rarely disappoints, and the ambience outside in the summer is awesome. Not much reason to drive to Champaign to drink when I can walk to Crane Alley!"}
{"text":"I tried their shrimp pasta...it was bland and had a weird taste. The service was a little slow, but friendly. The portions are good but for the price, I hoped the taste would have been a little more pleasing."}
{"text":"I was back in town a month ago or so, and we went out to Crane Alley. I saw someone else posted something I felt that night - they expect you to stay in your assigned seats. I definitely noticed that. From now on, I will only go later on at night when there aren't so many groups out. Still - awesome beer selection and bartenders!"}
{"text":"First off: free pool till 4:00.  All around, this place is an excellent weekend afternoon relaxation spot.  We stopped in this past Saturday around 2:00.  It wasn't empty, but it was far from busy and the pool tables were unoccupied.  If I didn't live out of town, this would be my March Madness go-to spot.   Second, other good details: I got the turkey pita, which was just the right size, fresh and slightly crunchy pita bread, plenty of meat, and delicious with guacamole.  The beer selection here is impressive, covering a wide range of styles and breweries from around the country.  I consider myself fairly familiar with the microbrew landscape, and yet they still had about 12 beers that I had never even heard of, plus, Crane Alley does modestly priced flights of 4 x 5 ounce tasters ($6 + a buck for the really obscure  choices).  The servers were all nice and quick to help out whenever we needed them."}
{"text":"Definitely a staple for me when I lived in Urbana. The bar features a huge selection of craft beers and cocktails, as well as $2 PBR pints for the frugal drinker.  The atmosphere is fantastic. Weather-permitting, I always sit outside in the alley, but the indoor seating has a pleasant, relaxed ambience to it. As far as the food goes, you can't go wrong with any of their burgers. They frequently feature creative specials that are worth exploring. Their half sandwich, half soup/salad lunch deal is a good option if you're looking for something lighter."}
{"text":"This is one of my go to places in downtown Urbana. Great atmosphere and staff, you can't go wrong whether you're heading to happy hour after work or if it's date night with your significant other. What's great about Crane Alley is the welcoming atmosphere inside, and ample seating so you really never have to wait for a table. One of my favorite parts is their outdoor seating in the alleyway (don't worry, it's not a creepy alley!).  It's the perfect setup for the warm weather and when the lights are lit up at night it's absolutely beautiful. This is truly a place that has something for everyone.Their beer selection is always spot on, and always has something new to try every visit. Their food is great, especially their chilli and buffalo chicken sandwich. Bottom line: no matter what the occasion, this place will not disappoint."}
{"text":"Back when I used to drink, on an occasion, there was a \"vibe\" I was looking for-- dark, dive-y, with the option of smoking a cig in an alleyway where I could see the stars.    When I got that urge, Crane Alley was one of the options.    When they put out the tables, and the tiny lights are lit, sitting in that alley, traffic passing by, it's easy to forget-- the stress of the day, the problems at the other end.  But, booze is booze and as far as CA is concerned, unless you're drinking off the tap (which is a good option), it don't come cheap.  I will say this... drinking here is a different experience.  There's a sleazy undertone, stuff's dirty, bartenders (and even the barbacks!) are rude (dismissive).  And it's not because they aren't making tips... leave your money on the bar, and they'll just help themselves (had it happen numerous times to me... as a matter of fact, one actually wrote _in_ her tip on my credit card, once).    I wouldn't spend the money on the food.  You can find a hundred different places near to have a better meal.  If you're just gnoshing to keep up with the liquor, that's one thing, but if you want a bite with a beer, try everyone's favorite, Farren's! =D  All together, if it's what you're looking for, CA fits the bill.  There are better places out there, though."}
{"text":"Went here for a friend's birthday.  Gluten-free options were awesome. The gluten-free calamari as better than I have ever had at most places, and I have never had it gluten-free before.  The coconut basil chicken I got was good. The rice it came with could have used more flavoring, but the sauce was delicious.  The buffalo chicken sandwich my friend got was AMAZING. I took a bite and discovered the sauce was so unique and had a hint of ranch, which was so good.  My other friend ordered a Caesar salad which had homemade croutons (made from a baguette) and was extremely larger.  Definitely coming back and getting that Buffalo Chicken sandwich.  Lots of unique choices! All the entrees & sandwiches looked good."}
{"text":"Great beer selection, delicious food. Great place to bring out of town guests. Usually how I ended my bar crawls."}
{"text":"Just okay. I ordered the tuna pita, which was served on top of over-toasted (Not a typo. Maybe it was oven toasted, but it was also OVER toasted) flatbread. I was expecting an open pocket pita with the fixings inside. I could neither cut through nor fold the bread like a taco, so I just ate the food that was placed on top. The tuna was unexpectedly fancy--I thought it would be tuna salad, but it was an actual fresh filet of tuna. Unfortunately it was way too pink in the middle so I only really ate around the edges. The other miscellaneous stuff they put with it was meh. Disappointing. I left unsatisfied. AND our orders took forever to come, and it was not busy at all."}
{"text":"Best hummus around!  This is or family default restaurant... beer for dad, pretzel bites for the boys, and of course, hummus for mom."}
{"text":"They recently updated their menu, and it's great!  I had a greek salad and added salmon, and my husband got chili mac and we both enjoyed our meals.  The beer selection is great and changes seasonally.  Our server recommend a glass of wine, and I took his recommendation which was a great choice!  We will be going back more often."}
{"text":"If you're over in Champaign waiting in line for one of the hot spots there, you are missing out on this Urbana gem!   Just like the name says, Crane Alley is IN AN ALLEY. I think that's the coolest thing. Sure, they have a nice little interior space, but it's all about that alley, y'all. I'm such a sucker for outdoor dining -- give me some exposed bricks and strings of lights overhead, and I'm a happy boy. It's really beautiful.  The service was stellar. Everyone was incredibly friendly and helpful -- especially when navigating around a food allergy. Our drinks were constantly refilled, but our server was never intrusive.   I heard the menu was recently revamped, and I was impressed with all the comfortable choices. Crane Alley won't win any awards for the most creative or inventive food, but these traditional options are made with quality ingredients and lots of care. This is a place I could easily come to often -- the food isn't so unique or expensive that you only want it every once in a while.   I'm not a beer drinker, but I hear the selection is outstanding.   I most definitely recommend Crane Alley for a low-key meal with friends or a romantic date with your boo."}
{"text":"Large selection of good beers. Unfortunately everything else is bad. Insipid sugary cocktails and overpriced food. I've rarely had anything good here. The beet chips are pretty good, but the wings seem to be soaked in battery acid and the tempura is just gross (who fries moist baby carrots?). I had some good steak once, but that was quite unusual. Come for pool and drinks, leave when you get hungry."}
{"text":"Vegan/Vegetarian and gluten-free options O PLENTY! Gluten-free beer, too! Check out the vegetarian section of the menu, and feel free to order a g/f Two Brothers Prarie Path beer.   What a cool spot! I wish I had discovered it sooner! I kept noticing great songs while I was out for a liquid dinner + appetizer. My husband and I ordered the guac and chips with our beers.  The guac is pretty good, a bit heavy and thick for my taste, but tasty nonetheless. I might need to ask if they use dairy in it...  I was surprised to discover that Crane Alley uses seitan for many of their vegetarian dishes. I've never seen this at a bar before. I might have to pop a Glutn-Go supplement and give the Seitan Reuben a try. It makes my heart and my tummy happy to find popular spots that offer cool vegan/vegetarian options!  I hope I can check this place out once more before I leave CU..."}
{"text":"recently went in to sit outside and eat. server was very nice. the coconut port was amazing but lets be honest this is about the food. i had a Reuben and a side of the Cajun slaw. lets start with the Reuben, standard reuben all that you would want on a classic. executed terribly. bread was toasted decently, barely any dressing, crout was good amount, not sure if they make the corned beef in house but it reminded me of the cheep Budding brand meat you get at the store but very dry and sliced wayyyy too thin. by what i could tell the sandwich got done being made and sat in the heat lamp too long because the swiss cheese had hardened onto the plate. other than that, it was standard. now the cajun slaw was spiced pretty good but needed some salt and lemon to liven up the flavors in it. would like to see more detail to the food quality."}
{"text":"I'm rarely disappointed here, the beer selection is 2nd to none, not just in the area, in the entire state!  The chili is always excellent and my favorite sandwich now is the buffalo chicken, its perfect.  I don't need much of an excuse to go to Crane Alley, its always a treat, and with warmer weather, sitting outside is even more reason to go."}
{"text":"Lets start with the good parts great beer and scotch list the food was good, fresh, and hot. So much for the good stuff, the wait service, bad is an understatement, we where seated the waitress took our drink order we got our drinks and she was gone. Finally we were able to get her attention and ask if we could order. We got our food and she was gone again had to go find her or yell at her as she zipped by to get anything you needed or wanted, even drink refills its a bar at least keep my beer full. Boy do you pay for the bad service you get, crab cakes appetizer, fish sandwich, ruben sandwich, 3 beers $60.00 not including tip a little steep for bar food"}
{"text":"Wife and I from out of town found this place based on yelp's recommendations. It exceeded our expectations. Service was great from an entire staff dedicated to helping each other as well as the customers. Beer and wine selections very good. We had crab cakes that were super good with a steak sandwich that was excellently prepared and a Caesar salad steak also well done. Give this place a chance it's worth your time and great atmosphere"}
{"text":"Goat cheese and hummus appetizers were great. So were the sweet potato fries. The regular fries? Meh. If i was better at billards, I'd come here more often. However, this place has a really chill ambience where you can just relax at the bar. Sort of like B Street Billards in San Mateo, CA if you know what I mean."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a friend and wasn't very impressed. We ordered bloody Mary's which were very good and only $6, I'll take that! We also ordered the BBQ wings and the chili cheese fries - neither were very good at all. I understand that we aren't exactly ordering delicacies here, but I've never really met a wing that I didn't like until today. The wings were sort of fatty and the sauce wasn't very good and also had kind of an odd consistency. We ended up leaving a few we disliked them so much. The chili cheese fries were edible, but looked and tasted like something that your mom threw together for lunch when you were a kid. Just not very good. However, our server was very efficient and they have a really nice outdoor seating area."}
{"text":"One of the first restaurants I went to in this town many years ago. So my review is skewed towards nostalgia. But the food actually is incredibly good. Most everything tastes like it's freshly made, including (I hope?) the fries. The beers are great, too. Pick any of the sandwiches and you will be pleased. The Reuben is a personal favorite. Ambiance is casual and comfortable. Service is friendly and attentive. Outdoor seating in the warmer months is a nice plus--particularly in contrast to busier versions across town in Champaign."}
{"text":"Based on my food alone, 5 stars!  I had blackened tuna pita with petit salad and it was amazing as served.  My husband had a fried fish sandwich and it wasn't great, but nothing compares to destihl's fried fish.  The service was terrible.  Our waitress was in a foul mood and had a bad attitude with every table in our section."}
{"text":"some good beers on tap and a couple tables for stick---good buffalo chicken sandwich."}
{"text":"the first time i came to crane alley i had trouble finishing my beer in the smoke haven that is the outside seating section of the bar.  i'm pretty sure i nearly died that night.  the second time i came, i ordered one of their incredibly over-priced martinis and it tasted like triaminic. no joke.  when i told the server that it was awful he brought me some sprite to put in it and said it was all he could do.  believe it or not the sprite made it soooo much worse.  luckily my face was so contorted with the bad taste it convinced the server to go against bar policy and bring me something else.  i had to pay for my new drink...but luckily he took the first one off my tab.    the third time i came i had the potato pancakes and fell in love. yumyumyum.  in summation, crane alley is a good place, i always go back.  but like many places in urbana and champaign, its can be a hit or miss, you just have to be willing to take the chance.  i would however stick with the large and in charge beer menu and the more common mixed beverages.  the martinis are way over-priced and i just never every want to taste triaminic spiked with vodka again, thankyoumuch."}
{"text":"Crane Alley is known in town for its beer selection. They've got like 15 rotating taps and hundreds of different bottles.  The table service has gotten better recently.  I think some bad servers quit or something.  The bartenders who work at night are always knowledgeable about their beer.  They are great at making recommendations.  The menu has a good variety.  Their food specials are usually a good deal too. I went in last friday with my mom, the cute little hostess seated us exactly where my mom wanted to sit (she can be quite difficult) and our server was attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"Great craft beer draft and bottle selection and food! Cool building too. Awesome burger specials everyday."}
{"text":"Love this place! Probably the best beer selection in Champaign-Urbana and really cool vibe. It's great food, great beer, and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Don't order the fish here, it's clearly frozen, not fresh. I've been to this restaurant several times with groups. While there's a decent drink/beer selection, it seems like most of the time alot of the food items on the menu are not available. The one thing I do love about this place is their sweet potato fries, which is topped with brown sugar. This is definately more of a bar + snacks kind of place and not so much a sit-down restaurant though they try. And as far as bars go, there are less expensive and better, elsewhere in town."}
{"text":"Service is incredibly accommodating.  Food is pretty darn good.  Pool tables, with a nice, cozy darkness that doesn't attract too many obnoxious student types? Check.  Just like any other great bar until you notice that they have Dark Horse Crooked Tree IPA on tap. And they're planning a dinner event to honor Dogfish Head where they'll be tapping a keg of the holy 120-minute IPA? Impressive. Way to stock the best beers! I didn't realize those vendors even made it down to Central Illinois.  Oh, and I almost forgot, they have Beet Chips with a Chevre dipping sauce. -- Definitely worth a go!"}
{"text":"Crane Alley is the only bar I go to in Urbana, and has the best bottled beer menu of any bar in the area.  In addition, it will have more than 10 draft beers at any one time from various microbreweries and craft breweries.  The reasons to stop by don't stop there, since there is also a fairly extensive menu of tavern-style food, which is higher quality than what one usually comes across.  My favorite appetizer is Crane Alley's signature beet chips. Every table around us got this appetizer, since it is one of the dishes that Crane Alley is most known for. The beet chips come with a bowl of a goat cheese dip (which has cream cheese mixed in). The dip is somewhat rich and heavy, and helps to bulk up what might otherwise be a rather light appetizer.  The sandwiches at Crane Alley run up to around $10, and the main courses a bit higher than that. Last visit, my girlfriend got a portabella mushroom burger, which was one of the daily specials, and of course had no meat. However, it was bulky enough to offset that and not be as light and unfilling as a lot of vegetarian food ends up being. I got a beer-battered fish sandwich, which was crispy and fairly large (way too much fish for the bun), along with the sweet potato fries (another thing Crane Alley is known for). One of the complaints I usually have about fried fish sandwiches is how greasy they are, but luckily this sandwich didn't fall into that trap.  The primary lure that Crane Alley has is its wide selection of beers and drinks, which can be ordered alongside a selection of appetizers or food (something some local competitors do not offer). In addition, it has weekly special dishes and daily specials, and special beer and food pairings on set dates (tickets must usually be purchased). I would highly recommend anyone in the area or at the university make the effort to stop here at least once."}
{"text":"This weekend was Mom's Weekend at UIUC, and my mom, my friend, her mom, and I decided to come here for lunch. What a good idea!   The waitress was quite nice and accommodating. Even though the place was packed, she spent a long time helping both my mom and her friend decide what to eat, and was very accommodating overall.  The food arrived quickly, and the waitress checked up on us at least 3 times to ask if everything was alright or to give refills.   My mom and I both ordered the mezze plate. The whole thing was delicious; I hadn't had falafel or taboulleh in a while, and this did not disappoint. My friend ordered the black bean burger, and her mom ordered a portobello burger with a black bean patty; they both said their food was excellent too."}
{"text":"Overpriced for what you're getting. The food isn't exactly rich or flavorful but fills you up and satisfies your hunger, if that's what you're looking for. On weekends, they have a deal where you get a free game of pool with a lunch purchase and we were really happy about that! It's probably the only reason we'd return."}
{"text":"I thought Crane Alley was my favorite restaurant. It's not. I just had one exceptionally good time, and the rest were more faithful representations.   Crane Alley offers certain dishes for a limited time. The first time I came here, it was the salmon burger, and oh my god, it was scrumptious. It was, like, one of the most yummy things I've ever had. I never saw it again :(.   I came back here, I think, three more times. Still yummy and then progressively less so. I think two of my least favorite things that I've tried (here and in my life time) were their spaghetti and lamb meatballs (which was laughably overpriced for how it tasted) and their Cuban sandwich.   The spaghetti dish was bland and mushy. The lamb uninteresting. It was a comforting meal, but seriously disappointing for its price and for the standards to which I held Crane. It... sort of tasted like Chef Boyardee. I like Chef Boyardee (I know, guilty, repugnant pleasure), so I'm not saying I absolutely despised it. Just... Not great.   The Cuban sandwich broke my heart. It really did. I was expecting a Cuban... Like, you know, a pressed Cuban sandwich. Like, you know, a Cuban. Well, it came on a sub, not pressed, and sliding around in its mayo. Not pressed. Not impressed.  I'd most definitely come back for the salmon burger though."}
{"text":"Crane Alley has a great beer, wine, and hard liquor selection. Dinner can be fun here because the bar has made some excellent lighting and decoration selections. Service is \"fine,\" and although the food is not the greatest ever, it can be enjoyable while out for fun with friends.  Even though food and service are really more like three stars, I'm going to go with four because the place is fun and the selection of alcohol (the most important thing, really) is superb."}
{"text":"I, like a fair amount of other people, think that crane alley is pretty hit/miss.  I love their beer selection, and their bartenders are friendly.  We were their last weekend, and their hostess almost drove us to insanity; we had a group of 7, and two tables opened up, more than enough so seat us all, and instead of pushing them together, she sat 2 people at the 4 person table and then let the other sit empty.  At that point, we were told the wait would be 20-40 minutes.  After an hour, still with empty tables, we went to ask.  She said she'd seat us in 10 minutes... and finally 30 minutes later after bugging her twice more, she got us a table.  The bartenders actually compted us the pool because they felt so bad.  That being said, our waitress was very friendly, though not always present, but very accommodating.  Food was ok, but we were annoyed that we waited 1.5 hours to be seated when there were empty tables the entire time... we started to wonder if she was mad at certain wait staff members and trying to spite them by not sitting people in their sections.   That being said, I have had much better experiences there, and I hope that never happens to anyone else."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite place in all of Champaign-Urbana for casual dining, date night, girls night, lunch, an outside chill session in seasonal weather, or happy hour. It draws a varied crowd, but you'll see just about any type of person on any given night. It's a smaller place that has a lot more space when outside is also an option, but there's hardly ever a massive wait except during any one of the many special events they have. The serving staff are always super friendly, accommodating, and knowledgeable about the food and the many many beers they have on tap. This is always my go-to for just about any setting, and I haven't had an actual bad experience yet. This is the place responsible for fostering my interest in craft beer due to the challenge posed by the world beer tour, during which you get small prizes leading up to your own little plaque by the door for completing a tour of 100 unique beers.   The food is a little more expensive than a standard chain restaurant that might have also been on your list if you were narrowing your choices down to a few places, but for the atmosphere and what ends up on your plate, it's worth it. The sweet potato fries are always delicious (either the appetizer or swap these for regular fries and you will not be disappointed) and one of my personal favorite menu items is the chili mac. It has beer cheese sauce and their divine chili. Basic, but so so good. They also do kinda fun and funky monthly (or so) events where they are tapping a special beer or serving a special menu in addition to the regular full dinner menu.   I have a lot of friends who after leaving town post-grad school tell me that this is the ONE place they really miss and could find an equivalent of in their new area."}
{"text":"It was a busy day. I called the lady I usually see to get my fingernails pulled out, but she was on vacation, so I stopped by the guy's place who pisses on your leg for $18 and tells you it's raining, but he was at his urinalysis, so I decided to just go to Lacy's. The owner of Lacy's got arrested, so I went next-door to this godforsaken turd burglar commune to get my daily dose of guaranteed disappointment. It was terrible like a french kiss with a flu-stricken meth-mouth wench after a garlic bagel breakfast.  The salads are shockingly barren of any of the advertised ingredients other than lettuce. The falafel is akin to balled mashed potatoes and shares a similar sharpness of flavor. The wait times are what you'd expect at a place that does live butchering-to-plate service. The fucking chicken wings are breaded. Who does that? This restaurant employs what I call \"Urbana pricing\" where each item costs more than anyone would ever pay in a city with enough restaurants to compete with each other.   If there is a restaurant in Champaign County with a worse menu, as low quality food, and as consistently bad service as Crane Alley, please tell me about it. I probably wouldn't go there ever again either."}
{"text":"One of my favorites in Champaign-Urbana...great \"spirits\" menu, featuring a wide variety of beer/ale and wines.  Pleasurable laid back environment makes this one a \"must do\" for happy hour or the occasional weekend drink.  I like to go to Crane Alley when I want to just relax and unwind with a glass in my hand and talk to good friends, or maybe make a few new friends.  All food I've eaten here has been great, no complaints....will go back time-and-time again - a strong recommend."}
{"text":"Crane Alley is a great place for an app, a burger and a beer. Their spinach artichoke dip, crab cakes, and calamari are all very good starters. I almost always get their portabella burger, which is very good. My partner loves their reubens and says that they are his favorite in town.   It's a great place for friends to meet up or for a casual date! In the summer, their outdoor alley seating is wonderful and much preferable over their indoor seating! 4-stars instead of 5 because of higher pricing for casual bar food."}
{"text":"Good place in downtown Urbana for a bite & flight. Open late. Billiards. Plenty of seating but can be loud. Outdoor seating in temperate weather. Flights are now $7 for 4 5oz beers."}
{"text":"Crane Alley receives an admittedly very biased 5 stars from me.  This is partially because they're currently carrying two Bell's beers on tap (Amber--divine, and Hopslam 2X--10% abv and so magically sweet AND hoppy that Teej, my fiance and I decided that it must pour directly out of the Easter Bunny's anus...the most magically sweet and hoppy of all the rabbit anuses, as you know).  Bell's aside, Crane Alley is a place I want to be at all the time.  It's dim, but not dank.  Tasteful, and not over the top.  The waitress checked in an appropriate amount of the time, was friendly, and had mad non-spilling-the-water skills when pouring all the way to the top of the glass.  I had the falafel pita, which was only 'okay', but was later upgraded to 'good' when I added salt and pepper.  It came with quinoa tabbouleh that was the slightest bit creamy, and oh-so-plentiful.  Mmm....quinoa tabbouleh."}
{"text":"Great beer selection. We had a fun afternoon playing pool (for free), and grabbing some drinks/appetizers.   The bartender was fantastic. They were relatively busy, but he provided attentive service. I was able to try a few beers before choosing what I wanted, which was awesome. I really enjoyed the \"zombie killer\" cherry cider.   We had calamari, which was decent. Not the best, but fine for bar food."}
{"text":"Me and my friend tried Greek salad and chicken wings, both are delicious.   The wings are juicy and tender, we'll definitely go back for them again! I usually find wings at restaurants either too salty or oily, but their wings are just right for me!   The salad tastes amazing, but A few of the salad greens are slimy, and the romaine lettuce is a little brownish at the edge. l let the waitress know, and the manager gave us a $3 discount. Fair enough. Plz keep the salad greens fresh because I'd love to come back again for some light lunch. Loved the coffee too, I like the strong taste (and free refill of course!) My friend teaches piano across the street, and we've been going to courier cafe a lot recently. Food is good but we're a little tired of eating at the same place all the time, plus their coffee is very light. Glad we found a new good place!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is very casual, there are pool tables and it kinda has a bar vibe. There were very few people there while I was.   While I really enjoyed the Mezze Plate I ordered, I didn't think the price reflected the atmosphere and service over all. There was no bread served, my glass of water was constantly empty, and the friend I had dinner with requested to have vegetables instead of mashed potatoes with her salmon and was immediately turned down. For what she was paying, you think the server would have made some attempt to replace the potatoes for another side...   Again, the food was good, but I will not be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I have to agree with those holding the \"OVER-Rated\" opinion.    The best thing about Crane Alley is the drinkin'.  They have loads of beer selection, the bar is well stocked, and we all got a little over appreciative of their fine scotch selections.  The food and service though, both left much to be desired.  They serve typical pub food with some updates/twists.  Beet chips?  Why not?  Our apps were all ok, not great.  The service was slow, like stuck in tar slow.  Everything here is on the expensive side.  Go for a night of trying different brews/liquors; eat somewhere tastier before heading over!"}
{"text":"I really dig the vibe in Crane Alley. It's a little casual, a little intimate, a little divey, a little trendy. Not pretentious, not lazy, not overpriced, not overkill. The Golden Mean as Aristotle would call it. The food is usually good, with special props to the Reuben. Good beer selection as well."}
{"text":"Not only has the food at Crane Alley become progressively poor in quality over the years, but the staff - hosts and servers - are incredibly rude. The host, upon seeing we had a large party, rolled her eyes and and rudely announced that \"It's gonna be a while,\" before walking away. I'm looking at you, host on Dad's weekend Saturday night.   I finally swore off Crane Alley a few months ago because I was tired of being disappointed by $50+ casual dinners and drinks with my partner.  Unfortunately my friend decided he want to have his bday celebration here so I was obligated to come. I ordered a grilled cheese because: how can they possibly screw that up? They managed to do it: my sandwich came out cold and soggy - the cheese was congealed!  I can't recommend enough that CUers stay away from Crane Alley until they clean up their act."}
{"text":"Lots of fun food choices and tons of beer selection.  A good place with several gluten free options available. You can find both lower cost and higher cost item here.  A few eclectic things plus mainstream.  Something for everyone. They also have a fun alleyway seating space with cozy lighting in the summer time."}
{"text":"My brother and I had dinner at Sitara (just around the corner) and decided to chat for a bit over a few drinks before he had to move on to other plans. Crane Alley is quite an interesting establishment. It is a proper restaurant, but also serves quite well as a late night bar. Pool tables were getting good use before 9pm. Since we had already eaten, we just needed drinks. No issues with us taking up a table. The drink menu is quite extensive. Impressive. I am not a big drinker, but they Lambic bottles. I got raspberry. My brother got a few beers. Our bill was $20. I'd like to stop by another time to try out their food. Folks around us seemed pretty happy with their food."}
{"text":"I like the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich here. I also like the selection of beers and flights. Real chill place to go and kick it with some buddies or to start off a night."}
{"text":"I've been a little stingy with my 5 stars these days, and I'm tempted to rate this 4... but the sweet potato fries... there is just nothing like them!  I've been here twice now during my quarterly visits to C-U.  The food, burgers in both instances, has been consistently good.  Now I live really really close to the infamous Kuma's Corner in Chicago--their burgers are so famous they've been featured on the Food Network.  That having been said... my standards are pretty high... and Crane's, I must say, makes a darn tasty burger! Today I had the special--1/2 burger with mole, roasted chilies, pork shoulder, and chihuahua cheese--oooohhhh yes.  Aside from tasty burgers, their beer selection rocks.  They literally have one full page of IPAs.  And that's just the tip of the iceberg. Their draft beers (which I believe rotate?) are quality as well.    The place is big, their outdoor (alley) seating is great in the summer, and the service is good.  Though I must warn you... my first time (in the summer) was during some crayfish special... tables of rowdy bikers cheered on ladies in leather bumping and grinding in their laps.  I'm not sure what was going on, and I don't know if it is somehow related to the crayfish, just thought it was worth mentioning."}
{"text":"I don't normally like falafel sandwiches but I love theirs. They also serve delish hot pretzels with cheese, good veggie pasta dishes and a yum vegetable sandwiches. Fun and interesting beer choices. Half Acre now on tap. Always great service and priced right."}
{"text":"Love the chill vibe of this place. Great place to grab a drink and chat, but I can't rave about the food. There is no complaint really, but nothing in particular stood out. I would definitely come back for a beer though!"}
{"text":"Came here expecting a lot - but realized that I should have set my expectations a lot lower.  First off - the beer is beer - it's not bad, the selection is great (mostly bottles) - so you can't go wrong there (though the Blind Pig might be a better bet overall.  However the food - oh the food :(  - I was disappointed.  It started with the appetizers - not looking for something \"regular\", I decided to try the Pretzel bites.  The only thing apt about the name was \"bites\"!  They're large-ish (golfball sized) baked pretzel dough.  Problem is - the pretzel dough wasn't baked today (maybe not even yesterday?)  - they take the pre-baked bites and put them in the (microwave?) oven for a few minutes and bring them out.  If you eat them fast you'll be okay...but once they start to cool they get hard (like - very hard!)  They come with cheese, which is - cheese.  Nothing special about it.  The reality is that my appetizer experience (and the lackadaisical attitude when I asked about the appetizer) kind of turned me off.  I didn't really make it past the apps...  Being a \"gastropub\" I expected a bit more - like at least freshly prepared food - out of this place.  When I'm sitting at a table my appetizer doesn't need to come out at McDonalds speed (if I wanted that, I'd have gone to Mickey D's) - do it right and live up to the \"gastropub\" name.  If you're eating *and* drinking, this is the kind of place to walk away from."}
{"text":"lovely when the weather is just right and I can sit in Crane alley with the lights above and a plate of chips and salsa and a nice drink"}
{"text":"I've been to Crane Alley 4 or 5 times. The first time I went, I had the chicken pesto with goat cheese and red peppers. It was so good, that I keep coming back, just for that. It's so good that I don't want to try anything else. I'm from the Chicago area so I can only visit a few times per year. I was there yesterday and they just put on a new beer, Bitburger, from Germany. It was on special and it was a great beer that went along great with my outstanding sandwich."}
{"text":"Loved this place in grad school and love it still.  Went here last Saturday to watch some football and baseball before a wedding.  We took our time and had quite a few (awesome) beers.  As always, a great selection.  While I felt a lot of places in the area of decreased their selections, Crane Alley has maintained one of the best selections in CU.    I got (as always) some buffalo wings (delicious) and the steak sandwich.  The sandwich was perfectly cooked and delicious.  BF got the pita pizza, which he said was also awesome."}
{"text":"Mehhhh this place is OKAY. Nothing worth going back to. My friend and I were in Urbana and we decide to try out crane alley (mainly because black dog was closed). He said he hear it was good. It wasn't. Before I begin, the food wasn't bad per say but it wasn't great. And for the price of the burger I got. It DEFINITELY wasn't worth it.   I got the 15$ burger thinking, well it's the most expensive one, should be pretty tasty right? WRONG. I substituted the fries for the soup of the day which was jambalaya. +2.50$. Blah. The jambalaya was actually pretty decent. Not amazing but it was pretty hardy. The burger came out and it just seemed like crane alley was trying to do too much on one burger. It had blue cheese, Dijon mustard, bacon and a few other things that didn't go together great. I've also forgot the name of the burger. It was the only one over 14$  I almost gave this place 2 stars but I felt kinda bad because it seems like they have a good beer selection and the staff is very polite. Would I go back? Probably not. Rather spend my money on the better places to eat in Urbana champaign. :-)  I would consider going back for a drink but nothing else."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now, and both times I had great food and even better beer.  Their food menu is pretty extensive and the artichoke dip is amazing.  Drink menu is huge, a wide selection of beers ensure you'll never have to repeat a bottle unless you find a favorite.  The ambience during the afternoon is great, both times I came here and occupied a booth in the corner to get some work done while I enjoyed some food and a beer."}
{"text":"The food is mediocre. If you're trying to have a party, be weary of the 15 dollar charge to cut your own cake."}
{"text":"My favorite date spot in champaign. They have a fantastic beer menu and a seasonal, chef-inspired menu. Their burgers are the best in town (in my opinion). And I am yet to have something here I didn't like. Staff is very knowledgeable, at tentative, friendly, and helpful.   One of Crane Alley's best features is its diversity of atmosphere. You can sit at the bar and enjoy, shoot some pool with your friends, or you can have a more private table in the back 2 stories of the restaurant that are quite and comfortable for having a nice meal. Then during the warmer months, you can sit outside on the sidewalk or in their quaint, creatively-decorated alley that is right next to the building (hence the name Crane Alley). The ambiance out there is top notch and I would highly recommend it any time the weather is nice!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is surprisingly good. Since I have a dairy allergy, I stick to the turkey pita club and its delicious every time. Also good - hummus, calamari, soup of the day every time, onion rings, bbq bacon burger!  Don't let the pool tables fool you; this is a classy joint."}
{"text":"Not a bad place for dinner. Service was okay. Everything was pretty standard. 11$ for Cobb salad which has my favorite avocado and hard boiled egg. No wow factors."}
{"text":"Been here multiple times.  Great atmosphere and service.  The menu is packed full of delicious options and they always have a great beer selection.  They are also dog friendly (outside obviously) and will bring your furry friend their own water bowl.  This is one of my favorite local spots."}
{"text":"I am making an edit to this review.  It is still a nice place where you can actually go with your friends or date and hear them.  Especially since you don't have to scream over the music and noise.    It is NOT a good place to have dinner any longer.  They changed their chef or something.  The miso mussels and linguine was horrible.  Totally alcoholic.. with no miso.  When I told the waitress she took my dish back to the kitchen and brought out something that was sooo salty.  Disgusting.  The mussels were also not fresh and made me sick later.  My friend ordered the reuben which used to be superb but was too salty as well.  You can guess that I will NOT be returning to eat here ever again.  It's a little more expensive than other bars in the area... so expect the drinks to cost a little more than other places.  I am not a fan of the beer garden since it's basically an alley between it's building and the next."}
{"text":"Crane Alley is one of those places that faithfully delivers a solid performance. It's not fancy but serves up good food and beverages for both lunch and dinner. I enjoy their wide selection of craft brews (the Wheach, a peach wheat beer, is a favorite for me) which is the primary reason to visit. If you get hungry there is a limited menu but what they do make is always tasty and fresh. Burgers are the best choice to satisfy a big appetite. The prices are a bit higher here but then so are most restaurants in Urbana."}
{"text":"I recently made a trip back to Crane Alley for dinner, and was dismayed by the alterations to the menu, primarily the price.  I remember buying affordable sandwiches for around $6, but all sandwiches have been bumped up to the $8 to $9 range.  ($8.50 for a falafel sandwich!?  Really!?  Those falafels are little nuggets of luxury now...)   Quality of the food ranges from standard to good, though there is usually nothing here that smacks of culinary sophistication (especially to justify charging $8.50 for a falafel sandwich!!).  When I'm feeling indulgent, I order the fish sandwich, which is all the greasy, crunchy-crusted fish I could want.  Appetizers here are decent.  The spinach and artichoke dip tastes like every homemade version I've sampled from friends' kitchens.  The beet chips with goat cheese are considered one of their hallmark dishes.  I agree they're good--when prepared properly.  It's a gamble.  Because of the color of the beets, I think it's difficult to distinguish when they're finished cooking; I often get beet chips that taste like black charcoal.  When friends propose coming here for happy hour after work, I just kind of dread it.  Crane Alley presents itself as a bar/pub, but they are more like a formal restaurant that expects everyone to stay in their assigned seats.  As someone who's waited tables in the past, I know large groups are challenging, but the waitresses here look downright insulted when they realize they have to serve our table.  They mostly avoid our group and hope that we won't ask for anything more than one meal and one drink.    Once, we showed up at a busy hour with a group of 8 and had to wait to be seated.  No big deal.  No one was complaining, we just stood in a group and chatted amongst ourselves.  After a few minutes, the hostess approached us, obviously annoyed, and said, \"If you have a group this big in the future, you're going to have to call in advance to make a reservation.\"  ...Ugh, really?  Sadly, downtown Urbana does not offer many options for night life, especially if you want to have a nice drink with your meal.  Crane Alley has broad appeal and is a general crowd-pleaser, so it is a safe option for a date or outing with friends.  Just make sure you don't bring too many friends."}
{"text":"I live in Urbana, and I think that this is the best place to go locally for some drinks and food.  Well, I used to think that, until I had a bad experience.  One night in the summer, I went to celebrate getting a new job.  The night was going well and the server was pleasant.  The food that we ordered was severely overpriced.  $12 burgers? Are we in Manhattan?  Because I can get burgers in Manhattan for less than 12 bucks and they taste better.  But, I'm digressing.  The main reason for the one star is because after two drinks, I forgot to sign my copy of the receipt.  I totally realize that this was my error--an unintentional one. However, the server took it upon himself to run my credit card without authorization and give himself a full tip, even though I didn't agree or sign anything.  Shameful in my book."}
{"text":"Crane Alley is a little expensive but their food and great drinks make it worth it. Their happy hour on Sunday and Monday runs late so it's a great time to get a couple of drinks and appetisers."}
{"text":"I live 90 miles away in Springfield, but often spend a week in Urbana for work.  When I'm here for 5-6 nights, 3-4 of those nights will be at Crane Alley.  Between the amazing food and the huge drink selection, I'm all in, baby!"}
{"text":"Crane ally is a great spot for food and drinks. Great outdoor seating! I've been here several times and the food is always good. A ton of drinks to choose from. The service is usually good but I have a had a couple sub par servers here. But I'll keep going back because it's one of my favorites in CU"}
{"text":"I love Crane Alley! Especially during the summer when it's warm enough to sit outside with ambient lighting. There's a good amount of seating inside and outside, so I haven't experienced much of a wait to be seated here ever. There's also a few pool tables if that's your thing!  The beer selection is always changing - which is always awesome and also super helpful if you've got their Beer Tour card! After a certain number of beers on your card, you get a mug or something similar. After 100 different beers, you get your name on the wall.  As far as food goes, I haven't tried much but their spinach artichoke dip and sweet potato fries are pretty good!  Overall, I've usually had pretty awesome waiters and decent service. I think it's a nice little gem in downtown Urbana :)"}
{"text":"Their desserts are now made in house and are pretty fantastic.  The mint cheesecake isn't heavy and is refreshing.  The cheesecake in general here is way better than the cheesecakes I could find in St. Louis.    Seriously.  They seem to have a rotating thing of desserts but if you see the carrot cake get that too.  It's a lot more delicate than what I'm used to."}
{"text":"In my mind this is a first and foremost a bar.  An awesome bar with an a lofted upper level that looks down on the pool tables. A bar that has more private, cozy seating in the back. A bar that sets up outside in the breezeway (Crane's ALLEY).  Great beer selection. Decent prices. Lots of seating. It was a pretty classy addition to \"downtown\" Urbana when it first opened.  And fooseball... there are some crazy fooseball sharks. Don't let their meager appearance fool you."}
{"text":"While I was a student at UIUC, it never crossed my mind to go here.  Only after I graduated and moved away did I come to like beer and realize how many opportunities I had missed in Champaign/Urbana...  So when I was in town visiting, I finally had a chance to go here.  I thought the beer selection was good, but I would have preferred more options on tap.  Because I'm used to the higher cost of living in Ann Arbor, the beer prices seemed reasonable, especially for flights.  That said, I expected them to be slightly lower, since it's Urbana and not Ann Arbor.  The menu looked great.  I got the porter marinated steak and was really excited because everything about it sounded like exactly what I wanted.  The food was somewhat disappointing, though.  I wouldn't say it was bad, but it was a little bland and just didn't live up to my expectations.  If I come back, I'd probably just get a burger or sandwich.  Service was fine.  Our waitress checked on us just enough, and food came out in a reasonable amount of time.  I'd definitely stop here again if I'm in the area, but I wouldn't be too upset if I couldn't."}
{"text":"approaching on the one year anniversary of the day i decided to stop coming to crane alley. And I have to confess I DO NOT MISS IT ONE BIT! Crane Alley is the equivalent of playing Crimes Against Humanity with your friends, you go only to humor people but you are bored the entire time and hate yourself for doing it. the staff is extremely rude and the food unimaginative."}
{"text":"Something here to drink for everyone. Staff is friendly, knowledgeable, and can always suggest something. Food is a bit on the pricey side, and pretty standard bar fare. I recommend the pretzel bites and black bean burger. I come here either with my parents when they visit town or on a failed Tinder date."}
{"text":"Some of the best burgers in town! They also have seasonal/weekly items that are prepared using local produce. Other menu items are delicious and reasonably priced. Beer selection us decent. Only negative would be it can usually be loud - but that is to be expected in a good location."}
{"text":"IMO, one of the only reasons to ever go into Urbana :)  This is a place I visit often when I come back to see the family. A nice bar with pool tables, and an area upstairs. There is a nice beer garden in the alley next to the bar. Plenty of goodies on tap and in bottles. Boulevard Smokestack offerings, some Flossmoor Station, Two Brothers, DFH .  A really good bottle list too.  I believe they also have a monthly beer club that meets here as well.  The food is great. Lots of sandwiches and several other entrees that are top notch. They have the best fish sandwich in Champaing/Urbana. A good burger and Reuben.  About the only thing I have to complain about is the service. The waitresses can be slow and don't always get the order right. Besides that a great place to quaff some quality beers in downtown Urbana."}
{"text":"Skip this place at ALL costs. I went with a small group and the service was horrible. We were seated after a long wait and then told that we could not order food because the kitchen was too small and had too many orders already in! What kind of establishment tells customers (who are seated and hungry) that they cannot order food? What a joke! We asked for salsa and chips and were told that we could not order anything. It took everything in our power not to walk out. Once we finally were able to order, the staff and management stared at our table and could not wait to take our plates. I was not even done and told the manager to leave my plate. This place is ran poorly and needless to say, our group won't be back! There are many better places to eat in the CU area!"}
{"text":"Great (!) Beer selection and friendly wait staff. The food is also generally very good. I especially recommend the spinach artichoke dip. Sooo yummy, but sadly a little skimpy on the pita that goes w/ it. Beers aren't cheap but I've never been anywhere w/ such a great selection. Pretty nice beer garden area on the side of the building as well."}
{"text":"I want to like this place more, because the service is good and the space itself is inviting. I like BEING here, but the food is mediocre. The burgers are mealy and taste more like seasoning than meat. Nothing I've had here is remarkable, and I've been lots of times, since it's a great place to meet up with friends and drink."}
{"text":"Maybe the most underrated bar/restaurant in all of CU. Granted the food can be hit or miss, but for a bar, the food is generally good. As I have attended many work functions here, I can attest that there is something for everyone on the menu. Aside from typical bar fare they often have unexpected items (ragout nachos, falafel).   A main draw for me is the beer selection. Always seasonal with a large number of taps. They have many local(ish) beers on tap from Tryptich, Revolution, Two Brothers, etc. You can even mix and match beers for a beer flight which is always a good gimmick."}
{"text":"(Chanting, in that well-worn 4 beat cadence) \"OVERRATED...OVERRATED\"  The food here is extremely hit-or-miss. Eating here three times, I have been very disappointed twice with my own meal and all three times with some aspect of the dining experience. Their menu sounds good, but is perhaps beyond the skill of its staff, as they often fail to deliver. Sauces are either too thin or too thick, either tasteless or too salty, and  every time at least one item was served too cold (even when it was just 2 of us). If you are the type that likes to occasionally order an appetizer for your entree, think again: many apps are really skimpy. Also, food service can be very slow at times, as I think they stretch their servers too thin. They also have very few vegetarian options, which surprises me, based upon their clientele.  Notice how all these comments are about food? That is because their alcohol service, selection, and quality are all beyond reproach. Their prices, including their alcohol prices, are pretty high for what you get. For the alcohol, I can justify this to cover the cost of carrying obscure barley wines (tremendous); to charge high prices for the food, is absolutely unacceptable.   EAT at V. Picasso's, Courier Cafe, Bunny's, Tang Dynasty, The Great Impasta, Xinh Xinh, Black Dog, Silver Creek, or even Siam Terrace, then DRINK at Crane Alley."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for lunch/dinner (it was 3...what meal does that count as?); it was pretty quiet since we didn't come during regular lunch/dinner hours.  Crane Alley is a \"Restaurant & Bar\" but it definitely feels more like a bar than a restaurant--it's very dimly lit, there are pool tables and a large bar area.  I guess if you like bars/feel comfortable in bars you probably won't notice this.  I got the veggie sandwich and it was amazingly good.  Please allow me to list the ingredients of this most tasty of sandwiches: cucumber, bell peppers, onion, tomato, sprouts, lettuce, basil oil, sunflower seeds and dill cream cheese, all on two big slices of wheat bread.  The greek pasta salad was also tasty, and overall it was a very satisfying, generous portioned meal for a little under $7.  My boyfriend had a hamburger and it was HUGE.  The fries were good and he liked the burger (although he said it had some kind of seasoning on it, which he seemed kind of \"eh\" about).  Between the two of us we spent about $15 (before tip and without any drinks).  Not bad.  The desserts also sounded really good (flourless chocolate cake...mmm...) but we passed on that this time.  I'll definitely be back.  I feel like if I had any interest in beer then this would be my new favorite place, but since I'm not a fan of beer or bars in general, that's kind of a deterrent for me (completely aware I'm in the minority here).  Oh well.  I'll still come back for their yummy food."}
{"text":"My two best dude pals just got married on St. Patty's Day in Urbana, and we headed here for the \"reception\" lunch. Charming interior, prompt service, and tasty eats!  Holiday fate included Irish stew, corned beef & cabbage, rare bit, Irish soda bread, and a platter of all of the above. Of course, I opted for the platter to get a taste of everything.  - Corned beef and cabbage was nice spotted in the Irish stew. Mmm... - Rare bit - basically cheese on toast, was horrid. Soggy bread with fake, melted cheese on it.  - Irish soda bread - classic! - Irish stew - infused with lamb, potatoes, and veggies. Very nice on a cold, windy day.  As for drink, I had my usual Strongbow. They don't have it on tap, just in a bottle. Eh, next best thing. Can't stand the taste of it out of those yucky cans."}
{"text":"Came here with friends. Ordered the corned beef reuben sandwich. Waited nearly an hour. It's just a sandwich. Got the sandwich. It was okay but wasn't worth the $12+tip and the near-hourlong wait. Our waitress was nice but rather overzealous in her crusade to refill our water glasses.  I'm not a picky gourmand. I usually give 3 stars+ to a restaurant as long as the sauce doesn't look like a mixup from the sperm bank (cough, Lake-Aire Restaurant of Lake Geneva) and lunchtime doesn't start encroaching on dinnertime territory. Maybe next time, Crane Alley."}
{"text":"BEST BLACKBEAN BURGER EVER IN MY LIFE.  i miss crane alley. it was my go-to restaurant in the CU area.   always: blackbean burger, no sprouts with a side of greek pasta salad. even better with a bloody mary or a spicy martini, there's a specific one that i'm talking about but i can't remember what it's called...  they also have an AMAZING beer selection. every time i go there are a few new draft beers. definitely try a beer flight.   oh and the sweet potato fries. so goooooddddd.  i've tried a few other items on the menu, but after finding the blackbean burger there was never a reason to order anything else. SERIOUSLY THE BEST EVER. 5 million stars."}
{"text":"Great beer selection, haven't tried the whole menu but what I had was good enough. Service just so-so for me."}
{"text":"Great place in Urbana for drinks and food, especially when the weather is nice and you can sit outside in the alley.  Definitely a solid place to go."}
{"text":"This is a great place to come for a drink and a late night meal. Last night, we had the poutine and a couple of $4 flights. With a friendly staff, this is one of our regular Urbana spots to visit.  Octoberfest here is phenomenal!"}
{"text":"I grew up in Urbana, and many times with so many great places to eat in the C-U/Campustown area it can be hard to choose where to go. Something everyone can always agree to is Crane Alley! The food is AMAZING and way better quality than most bars can claim. The sweet potato fries are a must try, and I also love the turkey pita sandwich! Also a great selection of beers and full bar, not to mention a great atmosphere. I love to sit in the alley in the summer! Definitely one of my favorite spots at home!"}
{"text":"Excellent food but very uncomfortable seating , requested a booth and got a hard plywood seat so it wasn't inviting enough to make me want to stay for an extended length of time."}
{"text":"Easily one of the best places to eat and hang out at in the Champaign-Urbana area.  Crane is always on the short list when we make the trip up that way.  The patio seating and the great ambiance of the old building really make this place stand out!  Also, the kitchen staff does a fantastic job with the food too.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"Every time I watch the How I Met Your Mother episode Best Burger in New York, I go off in search of something to satisfy that craving. There are a lot of mediocre burgers in Chambana, but you won't find that at Crane Alley.  My favorite was the burger with mushrooms, gorgonzola cheese, and caramelized onions. The patty was perfectly cooked and flavorful, and I could imagine obsessing over it like they did in the episode...  TV-related gushing aside, I really like this place. We also tried the steak frites with gorgonzola butter on top, and those were wonderful, and the beer selection is great. I like trying the flights myself so I don't have to commit to a full version of any one thing.  The normal fries are not great. Nothing especially wrong with them, just... not great. Also, the steak sandwich was good, but whereas the steak sandwiches I'm used to are best shared with at LEAST one other person, this is more of a one person sandwich, unless you're not that hungry.  Be sure to keep up on their facebook page; they have awesome beer dinners or other cool events from time to time! I went to a great beer and chocolate pairing a few weeks ago, and keep hoping there will be another."}
{"text":"The Craft Beer Battered Fish is a great deal for a quality fish sandwich. They do not skim out on the filet at all, and they serve it when it's still deliciously hot! They also toast the bun to give it an extra crunch. I normally eat half and save the other half for later, but I couldn't resist. My plate was completely cleaned by the time we left. I also ordered a small soup on the side, it was the blue cheese tomato soup and that was really great too!   We came during lunch, so there was no wait at all. I'd imagine a long wait later on during the day."}
{"text":"I was concerned about Crane Alley as soon as I saw the menu. The styles ranged from classic italian, to middle-eastern, to contemporary americana. Don't let all that fool you into believing this is some kind of fusion joint. It is just a confused menu.  We ordered the calamari as a starter. It was competently fried and the sauce had a nice kick to it, albeit bordering on pizza sauce.   We ordered the turkey pita sandwich and the chicken parm. Don't mistake that to mean that the sandwich was in the pocket. No, the fillings were served between two cold halves of pita. The chicken parm was mediocre at best, more likely just plain bad. Managed to burn the top of the mozzarella and still have borderline doneness on the breast. The worst part of it all is that this place is priced like a downtown Chicago eatery.   I will say, the staff was courteous and friendly. Ultimately, this is a bar. If you want a plethora of beer and cocktail options and maybe a burger: go for it. If you want a decent meal at a reasonable price: Steer clear."}
{"text":"As one of the original customers the day the place opened...I'm proud of where the place is today.  It's evolved nicely and still retains a lot of what made it great in the beginning."}
{"text":"this place is horrible. the waiters are rude and the food is average. the waiter I had never came back and filled our drinks and was nothing but rude to me and my family. the salad also tasted of dirt like they plucked it fresh out of the garden and didn't wash it."}
{"text":"I went there with my boyfriend and his parents for the first time last night. Very friendly, prompt service. But the steak frites appetizer was just french fries with eight tiny pieces of steak on top. The calamri we ordered as well was a bit under-fried, but still delicious. Everybody got a burger except for me. I ordered the chicken masala. It was delicious, but I woke up this morning sick to my stomach. My stomach still feels awful. I probably won't be going back here unless it's for drinks or just a burger. Terribly over priced and made me throw up."}
{"text":"Went here on Sunday for the annual Founders Cook Out. Showed up shortly after 2 and was in for a long long day of drinking and eating. The event started at 1, with the first special keg of KBS '15 being tapped at 2. Arrived right at the initial pouring. Got one of these extremely rare beers. We found friends in the upstairs mezzanine, and talked a waitress into allowing us to move a table next to theirs (even though there was a sign on the door that they wouldn't seat people until the full party had arrive; what is this, Black Dog?) As we got seated, I ordered the steak (at least a pound) rare. Locally sourced foods, cooked great. I can live with that. Kridz ordered the pretzel bites. Food arrived promptly (it doesn't take long to rare up a steak). Served with some delicious veggies and something else on the plate, that I don't remember. Steak was awesome. I was really in the mood for steak. The pretzel bites were pretzely and bitey. Served with their cheese sauce made with dirty bastard (I believe) it went well with the founders theme.  There was founders schwag on the table. We left it, I don't really need anymore beer schwag, and if I did, i'd just call up a rep and ask for some.  As I finished my kbs, I ordered an All Day IPA. Because, well, I was going to be drinking all day. As our friends left, we migrated downstairs. The bar was full, so we sat by another friend who was playing pool. Our waitress that we had upstairs kept us for the whole day, and was very attentive, filling our waters and letting us know when the next tapping was coming up (even when we were sitting at the bar).  The second special tapping hit at 4 pm. It was KBS 14. The harsher bourbon notes that were more present in the newer model, had muted. It was a very nice sipper. No serious alcohol burn either. Good notes of dark chocolate, a little figgy and dark fruits (think a little raisin), on a nice base of beer. It might come across as a little chalky, but still a darn good beer.  After we moved to the bar (by another friend), we had asked what the deserts were. There was a chocolate cake, and a cheese cake. I love cheese cake. Well, our waitress overheard us talking and put one in. I don't think we were ready for it, but what the heck. Cheese cake showed up, i'm not NOT going to eat it! At this time, (just after 4) I texted a buddy informing him of the event, he loves kbs, claims it's his favorite beer. But he couldn't come, because his wife is a paramedic and she was on duty, and he had the kid. I told him CBS was being tapped at 6, and that he had 2 hours to find a babysitter. I don't think he tried. Well, I informed him that I planned on having a $125 tab, and with the addition of the cheese cake, it was probably gonna be $150.  At 6, we ordered the CBS. It's flavors were much sweeter (as it's been aged in bourbon then maple syrup barrels). Not quite as chalky. Good maple notes. Would go good with pancakes.  At this point, someone down the bar had their food delivered. They got the pork belly. A friggin half pound of pork belly. It looked like heaven. I was tempted to order that as well. I was seriously VERY close to ordering that as well. It's like... a half pound of extremely tender BACON!!! I somehow managed not to get that. :( Then we left.  Come back next year.  Oh, went back on Tuesday night and had another KBS 14. Then went back on Wednesday for the beer club. (you don't know about beer club?)"}
{"text":"The burgers are typically good, service has been variable.  Unfortunately, we decided to try one of their specials which was some nachos with steak ragout sauce and roasted jalapenos, with a chipotle sauce. Sounded amazing but as it came, it was just a big bowl of chips and barely any sauce. It just seemed so plain and the ragout was just a dark mush of sauce that seemed like it came from a can. Nothing about it was special and this cost $14. I asked the waitress for more sauce seeing that most of our chips were very bare, and later when the bill came, she had charged us for the additional sauce. When telling her we ordered more sauce because the chips barely had any, she said \"I'll take off the charge, Jesus Christ.\" She was definitely rude and hostile--unnecessarily. If the kitchen messed up and didn't add enough sauce, you don't really need to charge the customer.  Either way, Crane Alley isn't on my list of placed I'd check out again. I'd rather check out Farren's in Champaign. The recent service and food option was definitely not something I'd want to experience again. Thanks, but no thanks Crane."}
{"text":"Stopped here with a group of six last night for a quick bite at a friend's suggestion.  It's a bar but has a legit restaurant in the back, and the two spaces are separated by a couple pool tables. We ordered a range of entrees from crab cakes to sandwiches and everyone was pleased with their orders. The chili and the tomato bisque both earned rave reviews. Friendly waiter who was very attentive. I will definitely be back on my next trip to Urbana!"}
{"text":"Rock solid! This place will impress even the biggest beer snob in the group, especially if Belgians are preferred.  Crane Alley is Champaign-Urbana's answer to Chicago's Hopleaf. No kidding. I enjoyed a Gulden Draak and my husband had the Local Option American Muscle. They have a fabulous, albeit limited, food menu and a weekly pool tournament. The servers are friendly & knowledgeable, and there are several dining areas away from the bar and pool tables for those who require a bit more privacy. My only complaint is the presence of babies, kids, and teens in the room...one of my biggest pet peeves.  Next time I'm visiting my parents in Shampoo-Banana, I'll certainly return to Crane Alley."}
{"text":"Restaurant review I really wanted this place to have the best burgers in town but it fell short of that expectation. We came here as a second option after we found out Farren's was closed for lunch. There was nobody here during the lunch hour which was nice because I could select that Chicago Bears game on the TV. They did end up losing however I enjoyed my meal while watching them lose. I was expecting more from their menu but I went with the war pig burger. This has half a pound of meat, bacon, grilled ham, and gorgonzola. Surprisingly even though there wasn't that many people at the restaurant it took quite a long time to prepare the lunch. I was a little disappointed with the brioche bun as it was slightly crispy. The burger patty itself lacked the strong meat flavor and was a little bit chewy however maybe it's my fault because it came out medium instead of medium rare. The fries were nothing exciting and I should have upgraded to the sweet potato fry. I think I'll go back to Farren's next time I'm looking for a burger.  Pros: Not too busy friendly service and lots of TVs  Cons: The food quality is so-so in the burgers are nothing special  Hidden deals: There was no special deals I found  Health code rating: B. Food appears to be prepared clean. The report indicates the restaurant/bar area could be cleaner. http://champaign.il.gegov.com/champaign/estab.cfm?facilityID=1027"}
{"text":"Awesome range of food and beer and the atmosphere is nice. This place has to be one of my top 5 in Champaign-Urbana, especially in the summer when you can sit in the actual alley itself. Not to mention, this place is great for some low-key billiards and beer after dinner."}
{"text":"This could be the most overrated place in CU.  Beer selection good, everything else pretty bad.  Service was particularly bad when we went and the food was not great for the price.  We ordered desert before our appetizers because we particularly wanted one of the options.  By the time we finished our main course, the waiter informed us that they had just sold out of the dessert we had ordered long before.  We were shocked by his honesty and incompetence."}
{"text":"I love Crane Alley,  their corn beef sandwich is top notch, the staff is fantastic and the atmosphere is pretty good.    The Alley with the lights hanging over the buildings in the summer time is  pretty terrific - you can sit there and sooner or later as people are walking through  the conversations start, everyone seems to know each other.  They have plenty of assorted beer's  and the best desert~!"}
{"text":"I like Crane Alley.  I think I would go there more if I lived in Urbana; living in deep west champaign I never really feel like it has anything to offer me that I need to drive to Urbana for.  I like their food alot (especially balsamic spinach strawberry goat cheese salad AH!)  and think the vibe is pretty nice:  clean, waitresses cleavage unexposed, no patrons likely to puke most of the time.  I've had REALLY slow service there alot of times, especially up in the loft."}
{"text":"We dig the atmosphere here and the alleyway patio is cool.  Decent beer selection and the food is all solid."}
