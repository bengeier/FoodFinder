{"text":"Ordered biriyani here , turned out to be one of the blandest tasting biriyani I ever had. Its not cheap either , around 14.50 $ ( including taxes ).. The interior is nice , reached there at 8:50 Pm and they had already closed. It closes at 9 Pm , not 9:30 Pm as mentioned here."}
{"text":"I love the shish!  This is the only restaurant my friends and I will go to for Indian food.  We've been going here for years. We always order off the menu instead of the buffet. Don't get me wrong. The buffet is good. But the best tasting and spiciest foods are on their menu.  Tikka lababdar and the kadhai are my favs!"}
{"text":"Close to my office. Yes the decor is dated but the food is good. Chicken curry is excellent. Butter chicken is reasonable. The nans are super fresh. Small family owned place, super people with good food. Lunch buffet is great value."}
{"text":"Got take out. Ordered 4 dishes and some naan: butter chicken, eggplant, saag, aloo gobi. It was all delicious! The left overs tasted amazing the next day too."}
{"text":"hints of authenticity.              Generous portions              Flavours and aromas present               Not overpowered by green chillies like most places   Little more work and this place could be an 8 of 10 ."}
{"text":"Ohhhh, the Shish!  Sure the decor isn't the greatest with fake flowers adorning every table and a rather confused style. But decor does not get in the way of good food!  I've been going to the Shish for years now and everyone in Mississauga who likes Indian food knows about this place which is tucked away on one side of an industrial park.  The buffet is good, but I go for the menu. The food is always fresh and hot. My favourite part is that it isn't swimming in globs of oil as is often the case at other Indian joints. Try: the amazing tandoor naan bread, the tandoor chicken, and the shrimp masala served on a sizzling hot plate. My all-time favourite is the madras curry as they make it both hot and spicy upon request. And of course, wash it down with one of the south-east Asian beers."}
{"text":"Not the best decor with burgundy tablecloths and brown wood chairs / black banquet seating.  Ordered mango lassi, veg samosas and veg pakoras.  Mains butter chicken and spinach and potatoes.    Samosas looked like they came out of a cardboard box and tasted like it too.  Pakoras were heavy little round balls of potato but missing other veggies.  Butter chicken was merely ok.  Spinach dish was spicy but overcooked.  Naan was fine but rice was a bit dry and peas in it were also a bit dry and hard.  They seem to have a buffet set up for lunch perhaps?  Maybe try again to see if it's better..."}
{"text":"They went out of their way to deliver to me a 10 min drive away. Food was excellent! Loved the butter chicken. Thanks!"}
{"text":"I have been ordering from here for a while now and I am liking it more and more with every meal. Consistently good and tastes freshly made every time. I have only eaten inside it once and fair enough to those who have criticized the shabby decor. Who cares though when the food is great!  For pickup they are always quick to make it and I've never had to wait. Highlights have been the chicken tikka masala, lamb vindaloo and the garlic naan is always on point.  It is my go to Indian place in the west end."}
{"text":"Ordered take out from Shish today for the first time (at an hour when they are usually closed between lunch and dinner, so it was very nice of them to go out of their way to serve us). The food was a tad pricey, but all tasted great, with decent portions--we didn't even touch our second container of rice, and have lots of chicken and paneer leftover for later. My only issue was that there was more sauce than chicken in the butter chicken, but at the time we ordered, maybe they had almost run out after the lunch buffet. Would definitely order again!"}
{"text":"Went here on my wife's recommendation as she used to go here when she worked in the area. This was several years ago so I don't know if anything has changed since then.  I ordered the chicken korma, onion bhajji, curried cauliflower and potato and naan bread.  I found the chicken korma very bland, the curried cauliflower and potato was 90% cauliflower but I didn't order it, just observing. The onion bhaji was good once I asked for the yogurt dip to go with it (my preference). The naan bread was fresh and tasty.  Service was good but there were only 2 other tables in the restaurant and one of them was friends of the owner or staff.  I could definitely find better Indian food in the area, wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"A hidden gem. Best Indian food around. Everything is always extremely fresh. The staff are very friendly. Highly recommend the $12 lunch buffet."}
{"text":"Really good, freshly made food!  We came in for lunch ordered samosas, parantha, and chicken biriyani it was definitely worth the wait and everything was delicious.  Spice level was not too high it was perfect.  It was our first time there and definitely not our last!"}
