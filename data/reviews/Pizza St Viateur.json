{"text":"The pizza here is sooooo good. 

They have really interesting combinations and the crust is thin and delightful. 

The Napo Pollo is by far the best selection. I know what you're thinking: \"Chicken and white sauce? Ewe.\". Don't judge this pizza by its ingredients, judge it by its amazeballs taste. I've made a few of my friends and family members taste this pizza and its a winner every time. Trust me. 

Other selections to try are the bruschetta pizza, which is fresh and yumzi. The three cheese is also very tasty if you like blue cheese. 

I usually order takeout from this place and eat it in the comfort of my home, but you can also eat there. The restaurant is sort of tiny, but there's enough seating for around 20 people. 

Very important: Always ask for the spicy oil. It's sooooo good. They can delivery a little container of it if you order out.

Another fun thing to do is to order takeout and eat your pizza at the pub next door (The Waverly). They allow you to eat your pizza and drink pints of beer at their bar, which to me always sounds like a winning combination. Enjoy, responsibly. 

Regarding prices and stuff, well the prices are good for the quality of the pizza. They also have a special: 4 small pizzas for $31, which is always a good choice. You get to have a little bit of everything."}
{"text":"Great quality fresh pizza, be prepared to wait maybe 15-30 minutes and pay $12+ per person for a decent but smallish thin crust 9'' pizza.   

Recommended for sure.  I would order from them if I lived in the area.  If you are looking for a cheap slice, look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Delicious, fast, hot delivery. We had the 4 for 31 deal. The chicken pizza was our fave closely followed by the four-cheese. Will get it again!"}
{"text":"One of the best pizzas I've had in a long time. The Napolitano was excellent, the thin crust excellent, and the dressing on the complimentary salad was amazing! The staff are lovely and laid back but also efficient. My pet peeve is overly enthusiastic and fake cheerful servers, and it was so nice to have staff that are genuinely friendly but not in your face."}
{"text":"Pretty good thin crust delivery pizza. We like to take advantage of their 4 for $31 deal , either when we have friends over or when we want lots of leftovers. They have lots of interesting toppings, with a little something for everyone, vegetarians and meat lovers alike (but nothing for vegans and gluten free people, sorry).

We live fairly close by and we are surprised by how little time it takes for the pizza to arrive at our door.  We are always told it will be longer, and it ends up taking a lot less time.  

Overall, it's tasty, priced right, and quick."}
{"text":"Excellente pizzeria! J'ai souvent l'habitude d'y aller la semaine car travaillant à côté et ai décidé d'y emmener ma conjointe ce samedi estival pour lui faire goûter la Mascarpone, mon coup de cur! Et à ma grande surprise c'était encore meilleur que d'habitude, service excellent, pizza divine! Allez y les yeux fermés!"}
{"text":"Extremely rude staff. I have been a customer for years but I will never go back now. They would not accept my loyalty card because they claimed one of the marks was inauthentic. As if I'm going to lie about that."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients, thin crust pizza, good flavour combinations. When I'm craving pizza (which is often) I'll walk over here. I've never been disappointed."}
{"text":"We ordered a calzone, pizza and green salad for delivery. Although the salad was decent for 4.50$, the calzone was burnt and tasteless (we took it with red pepped and marinated eggplant inside, but there was barely any tomato sauce), and the pizza (which we ordered with onion, green pepper and olives) came with mushrooms (which neither of us liked). The delivery took 45 mins although we live a few blocks away (too long), and they had to send another pizza (even though the owner kept insisting that their pizza all come with mushroom), and give the original one back. Leaving us with cold calzone. Overall, not a very good experience. There is definitely better pizza in Montreal. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best delivery pizza ever! Almost gourmet pizza at a good price! So tasty!"}
{"text":"Here's how I judge my pizzas. I enjoy both thin and thick crust as long as it's crispy on the outside and still slightly doughy on the inside. The crust must be solid enough to hold the cheese and doesn't get soggy underneath. Every slice must have equal amounts of toppings on each slice, I hate getting a slice with no or very little green peppers or mushrooms on it if it's an all dressed!  Final test is biting into the pizza and everything remains in tact and the cheese or topping doesn't just slide off.

We were three and ordered to pick up the 4 small pizzas for $31 plus tax. It was great that they gave us the option to choose four different types so it satisfied all three of our cravings. Person on the phone was very polite and accurate with the time that the pizzas were going to ready. When we went to pick them up they were just putting them in the box so it was still hot when we got home.

With all that being said, we ordered the calabrese, québécois, mascarpone and the goat cheese one. The pizzas were nothing special but my biggest disappointment was literally all the toppings were ONLY scattered in the centre of the pizza. Edges were completely dull and the dough wasn't able to hold the toppings. They also sprinkle too much of this herb mix over all their pizzas making them taste similar and making the pizza Taste not what it's suppose to. If you're craving for a pizza this will do but if you're expecting a 5 star pizza this isn't the place for you. If I could I would give it a 2.5/5 because it was decent but just not my cup of tea."}
{"text":"Service trop long ! Téléphoniste désagréable nous avons attendu deux heures et refusé la commande ! Service honteux !"}
{"text":"We were five friends looking for a quick, convenient meal after seeing a show in Mile End. It was raining so we wanted something fast but fresh too. 

Someone hesitantly offered up, \"pizza\"? And we all wandered into Pizza St.Viateur - a first for for every one of us. 

A few among us are self-identifying pizza aficionados so it's no surprise that the 'za here didn't make us do back flips, but I'm still happy to give it the A-OK stamp. I feel like you can judge a 'za spot based upon how they do basics. Take for example, the Napolitana (tomato sauce, mozzarella, basil); Pizza St.Viateur's version is fresh, and simple. I appreciate the thin crust too. The calzones are intimidatingly hearty and described by one pal as, \"flavorful-enough\". And thank goodness, the staff is friendly and efficient! They gave us five complimentary house salads which were only gross because they were doused in dressing and otherwise would have been a fine antidote to a hot, quick meal. 

Oh yeah, they offer free delivery in the hood too!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza, great price. Definitely a go-to for your regular Friday night pizza. Get extra sauce for extra deliciousness."}
{"text":"On m'avait dit que ce lieu avait une pizza excellente. Bof, bof, et rebof...  Nous avons commandé, un vendredi vers 18h30, leur spécial à 4 pizza 9 pouces pour 33$.  On nous avait dit que le délai  serait de 45 minutes... Il a finalement été de 1h45!!!!  Si encore, après tout ce temps, on nous avait remis des pizzas chaudes et des excuses.  Mais rien de tout ça! La pizza était froide sur les bords, tiède au centre, déprimant...
Gustativement parlant, nous en avions choisi 3 sortes: une seule était convenable, celle au poulet et sauce blanche.  Sur les autres, une sauce tomate insipide gâchait tout, probablement de la sauce en boîte...  Celle au poulet était bonne, par contre, c'est vrai.  Il y avait peu, très peu de poulet, mais elle était bonne, malgré la croute qui est moins qu'ordinaire, ce qui est dommage.  
En fait, pour être honnête, la pizza qu'on sert dans la station berri-uqam est meilleure que celle-là...  Mais si vous voulez payer pour le snobisme, par contre, c'est un bon endroit.  C'est la seule garniture sur laquelle ils ne sont pas chiches!  Ça et l'emballage!  Parce que bon, quand tu charges cher pour à peu près rien, faut au moins un beau packaging, non?!

P.S.  Si vous voulez une vraie bonne pizza, faites un tour du côté de la pizzeria Napolitana...  Ça va vous coûter 3$ de plus par pizza, et vous devrez vous rendre sur place, mais au moins, vous en aurez pour votre argent, pour chaque put**n de dollars que vous aurez investi!"}
{"text":"It's a solid 4 star. Quite cheap, good crust, good amount of variety in pizza. I went there to sit down and grab something to eat as my Friend and had been boozing for too long and needed to recharge with some good and cheap pizza! 

Even though the word cheap is used in this review, it's way better than your average-cheap-pizza! Have a lunch there, judge for yourself!"}
{"text":"When you smoke weed WAITING AN HOUR AND TWENTY MINUTES for your pizza to be delivered chances are the pizza is going to be worth the wait as long as it's still warm and not soggy.

I'd give Pizza St. Viateur pizza 4 stars in flavour, freshness and perfectly softcrunchy crust but only one star in kitchen efficiency and delivery service."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza, we have it regularly on site (comes with a free salad) or delivered. Our favorite is the Mascarpone, always amazing! (although mushrooms have quite a lot of garlic)."}
{"text":"Devanture trompeuse, branchée \"brooklyn\", alors qu'on se retrouve à déguster de la pizza de mauvais fast food. 
Insipide malgré la couche épaisse de fromage premier prix.
Evidement, je l'ai remarqué dés que mon petit copain Kevin a croqué dans sa \"Napolitana\": un regard plein de tristesse, l'âme troublée. 
Il savait et je savais... et maintenant, VOUS savez. 
La sauce tomate, la garniture, la croute, rien n'est au rendez-vous ou alors si vous êtes vraiment alcoolisé."}
{"text":"I liked the thin crust of the pizza but overall it lacked flavour and I wish that the basil was fresh. Fast delivery and the prices were decent. But it is not as filling due to thin crust so you may want to order more than usual."}
