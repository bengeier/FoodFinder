{"text":"Got a chance to visit the Irish Embassy while doing a little \"stay\"-cation with my wife at the Cosmopolitan.   After dinner and a show we were ready to head back up to the suite when we ran into the front line staff from the hotel, heading the 50m down Young street for an after work drink.   We were definitely surprised at how cool the place was, keeping the old bank feel and turning it into a pretty cool spot to hang. As mentioned before, quite a mix of patrons, from Bankers, Stiff-Suits, regular guys/girls and a douche or two thrown in for luck.  If I'm in the neighbourhood, I'll be back for a pint."}
{"text":"It really pains me to have to write this review for a pub that I had previously counted among my favourites.  I was there this past weekend with some friends. It was mid-afternoon and we stopped in for some late lunch. The place wasn't busy by any means, and the bartender/waiter cheerfully took our orders.  And then, we waited... and waited... and waited. It seemed that once some people showed up at the bar, the bartender forgot all about us and the other people sitting at the tables. The food, when it finally arrived, was quite good (or so I thought). But it took more than an hour for us to get our bills at the end of the meal, even after we asked three different people. Payment was even slower, as the bartender stopped to take drink orders while processing our cash and cards. And what's more, they tried to blame us for having the nerve to show up and patronize a bar during what was supposed to be a slow period. Not our fault if you're understaffed, gents.  Then, to add insult to injury, a few hours later I was praying to the porcelain gods, thanks to what must have been some off fish.  I want to be charitable and say that this is a great pub that was having an off day. But the terrible service capped off with the food poisoning forces me to leave the one-star review.  **Edited to add** A couple of days later when I got my credit card bill, I saw that the restaurant added an extra few dollars to the tip. I'm usually an excellent tipper and I had deliberately tipped a small amount in this case due to the terrible service. No problem, the pub simply STOLE money by writing themselves a larger tip on my credit card receipt. It was only a few bucks, but it's the principle of the thing. NOT COOL."}
{"text":"Mr Quinn sure has his problems finding good staff. It was a special occasion for me. Tried to plan, called ahead, but they had me in tears at the door.  A surly, obviously annoyed, aproned man loomed over me demanding to know what I wanted. It all went downhill from there. This same man signalled that I was 'nuts' perhaps bc I refused to be bullied.   I had dared to arrive after morning rush hour during staff's lunch-break. Rory, the mnger, made sure to come over to the table to 'police' the customer who dared upset his servers.  I learned he's got a biz degree from U of Galway & he believes that people have 'to eat meat or else the animals esp mice/rats will reproduce at such a rate that they'll take over the world.'  With this fine knowledge & after more 'evil eyes' from staff I escaped to the Dublin Room where I finished my spending quota satisfactorily due to a half decent server named Colm. Am trying to forget all abt it. I'm of Irish-Canadian Heritage & will not let this experience get me down. d'olamar a shlainte!"}
{"text":"Not a bad place, but I wouldn't jump at the chance to go back. The food tasted only OK, but the portions were quite small specifically the bangers and mash, the cottage pie and the fish and chips.   The prices are a bit high for the portion size which falls on the smaller side and the drinks. I was quite surprised to find that a pint of Smithwicks or Guiness was nearly $9 before tax and this at an Irish pub.  The bangers and mash will run you $16.  Overall the portion sizes were on the small side, but the bangers and mash were really smalls. You get three bangers which are ever so slightly plumper than the breakfast sausages you buy at the grocery store."}
{"text":"This place is always over crowded and i am not sure why. The food is not good!! save your money and go elsewhere"}
{"text":"It's fine. They serve beer. They serve food but don't make it particularly well. The service is fine too."}
{"text":"Went here for a mid-afternoon brunch, service and food were very average.  Ordered an Irish Breakfast which was fairly standard relative to other breakfasts, the actual food was a little different but the taste was average.  Steak and Eggs was overall average as well.  Eggs were excellent but the steak was not very good.  \"Fresh OJ\" tasted like Minute Maid."}
{"text":"service was great!! loved loved loved the food and drinks, the hostess was a sweetheart and she had the sweetest Irish accent. definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Didn't expect much when we first arrived at this pub but the Aussie bartender was super friendly, there was a lively crowd at the bar, and the live music was fantastic. Had a great night!"}
{"text":"Nothing to rave about. Decent prices, friendly Irish bartender, conversable place, laid back atmosphere and historical decor.  L. John Dory Twitter: @LJohnDory"}
{"text":"There is nothing really special about this place. It's an Irish pub that has French speaking channels in their TV lol.   The beer selection is decent but the food is nothing to rave about. I would recommend this place for watching the Canadians games on TVs.  I would not come back here if I had a choice."}
{"text":"I love real Irish pubs. This place is not an Irish pub. We entered on a Tuesday evening to 80's music playing loudly. We didn't stay for long as we sat for about 5 mins without a glance from the waitstaff as the over tanned pastel shirt wearing crowd were given jäger bombs by the truck load. We promptly left and will not return. If you want a good pub many exist in the city."}
{"text":"This is not a true irish pub. The food was average at best and a bit stale. Mostly full of guys in suits who don't know what irish is."}
{"text":"I decided to check out the Irish Embassy for dinner, as I was around the corner of  the restaurant at the Hockey Hall of Fame.  Outside, the pub looks like it could have been a bank at one time.  Inside, it's an urban Irish pub, complete with a banner honouring Pat Quinn as the Irishman of the Year (not the Pat Quinn who once coached the Leafs, a different Pat Quinn).  As for the reason why we go to restaurants, there is the food and drink.  When I asked for the beer menu, I was handed the entire drink menu, which was massive, but offered more cocktails than beer.  I wound up ordering a couple of Sleeman Honey Browns.  I ordered a salmon dish, which was tasty.  Since I also wanted a salad, I asked if it came with the entree.  It did not, but the server did point us out to a secret, that there's a small salad not on the menu that can be added to the meal for $3.  So I ordered that.  Prices were a little higher for the meal than what I would normally expect, but the prices were probably normal for downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"A nice, and very spacious bar restaurant. Food was reasonable and service was good. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner before heading to the Bryan Adams concert last night with a friend.   The experience I thought would be a positive one, took a quick turn for disaster.   I ordered the 8 oz beef burger that is topped with mushrooms, bacon and Swiss Cheese (sounded promising at the time). We waited about 30 minutes for our meals to arrive at our table, which is understandable considering how busy it was.   I got the burger and it looked good, but as soon as I took a bite and got to the beef- I knew something was off.  I didn't end up finishing it.   I woke up this morning feeling incredibly sick with food poisoning.   I do not recommend going to this spot."}
{"text":"It is a great Irish pub. My wife and I always go there. The bartender gave us personal tour of the bar and told us the history of the place. It has a beautiful Irish decor. Plus it has nice music. Stop here if you looking for a friendly relaxing place. Great clan chowder and lots of beer choices."}
{"text":"The food is good, but I wouldn't say is the greatest. I do love the casual pub environment though. I've been to this location when out with a few friends one day. We stopped there for a few drinks, which were delightful. No complaints there. I've also been there for lunch, the portions are small, variety is relatively on the smaller scale, and the taste is on the average side. I would say the best time to go here is for drinks, especially on a game night."}
{"text":"Stopped by for dinner one night and lunch one day.   Standard bar food but they have a large outdoor deck.   Decent prices. I stuck to a burger both times but no one I was with complained about their wings, sandwiches or anything else.   Good service.  Just nothing to write home about...just yelp."}
{"text":"Great pint of Guinness, food's ok but expensive for what is basically pub grub. Not a great spot on Friday night with loud suit types from nearby offices talking crap but the Guinness is great"}
{"text":"Had a couple of drinks here and a tiny, basic spring roll appetizer.  Beer taps were clean. Drafts were not skunky or funky.   Nice old historic building  - not sure what it once was.  Maybe a bank?  Crowd is late 20's to mid 40's.   Decent venue to catch all the sports on the multiple flat screens.  Guinness was fresh and tasty just like it was served in Dublin."}
{"text":"My spouse and I live very close to Irish Embassy and have been regulars there for the past year.  Dave the manager, all the bar stuff, and servers are always gracious, friendly, and kind when we come in. We have developed a great relationship with them  The hubs loves their chicken club and gets it often as well.    HOWEVER,  we went for a few drinks there this week to find out Dave had left.  There was a few new servers and one was very rude to us and said we couldnt sit at any table as it was reserved, despite the fact there were several open tables.  We told him Dave knows us and it is okay and thats when we were informed Dave has left.  The server insisted we couldnt sit at any table, was very rude to us, but eventually gave in after we assured him we would move to the bar if people came in for the table. Surprise surprise no new patrons came into the bar and all the tables continued to remain free for the 2 hours we were there.  My spouse asked to meet the new manager since we come in often.  The new manager was very rude to us, he was not friendly at all and seem annoyed we wanted to be polite and introduce ourselves.    We felt very uncomfortable and unwelcomed after that and have decided Irish Embassy will no longer be our local go to spot.    To conclude, the food is decent, the bar staff are friendly, but the new management and servers are very unwelcoming and rude."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. I went late on a Thursday night and found it a welcome change from the usual, congested ,loud pub. The place was lively but enjoyably so. Tables were accented with candles which was a nice  touch to the antique architecture. It made me feel I could stay just that bit longer and maybe enjoy a second Bailey's coffee.... The location is also great. You can slip in there after dinner at one of the many nearby restaurants or hop off the subway and go straight there for a bevy.  I don't know how nuts it gets on the weekend but I certainly enjoyed my visit. The only downfall I would mention is the amount of stairs to the washroom. You may want to escort your friend who's had too many or suggest the use the classy \"down the stairs on your bum\" technique."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch and was a little worried because I'd heard that they can be really busy.  However, we had no problem and received prompt, attentive service as well.   I had the chicken curry and it was served on a pappadum.  Very tasty....the platters are large.  I could only finish half of it and I have a fairly hearty appetite.  We didn't have drinks and I didn't end up paying so I can't really comment on the cost.  I would go again."}
{"text":"I like the atmosphere here a lot...  I haven't had dinner just drinks and usually on the weekend after a bit of shopping.  The beer on tap is great and the servers are very attentive and courteous."}
{"text":"Truly horrible! My guts are still churning. I ordered the burger. It was overcooked and definitely not  8 oz as advertised. Nor were the chips fresh cut as the waitress said. A lie. My partner's cob salad was not anything for the sort. Someone needs to give this crew a cookbook. If this is Irish hospitality, then it was shite! Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"Came here to begin a Winterlicious dinner with some work friends, seriously steak and beer, what kinda heaven is this!  We ordered a few rounds, not much that makes this place stand out though their ceasars are quite spicy (quoted).  We also got the Irish nachos which be forewarned are potato waffles and are not chips which is confusing if you're not expecting it. On a side note their guac is really salty, which was really weird."}
{"text":"Myself and my mom stopped in here after a visit to the Hockey Hall of Fame and we had a delicious meal. The service was a little slow but we didn't mind, they were all very friendly.  I had the best prime rib sandwich I think I've ever had in my life. I will have to revisit just for that. I know my mom also enjoyed what she had. It was a special of some kind. We took our time and liked it very much."}
{"text":"Horrible food! Very nice setting and staff, however the food was catastrophic. Very poor serving size and poor quality of multiple menu items. Would not recommend to eat ever"}
{"text":"Mediocrity has never been so expensive.   Loud.   Slow service despite being there during peak hours."}
{"text":"I have been lucky to go to Toronto for the past 2 years and this place has been a good place for us. Last year they did a great sunday brunch, this year it was cocktails until 3am. Good service & atmosphere. Popular with the locals at the weekend"}
{"text":"Food nothing special.  After 5pm gets crazy busy with business type. Definitely not a cozy place and a bit pricey for a not fancy bar"}
{"text":"Excellent pub with a nicer atmosphere! Good brunch too!"}
{"text":"Un des rares pubs irlandais de Montréal où je n'ai pas essayé le fish & chips. Ce n'est pas à défaut d'y être allé, j'y suis probablement allé une bonne dizaine de fois. Ce n'est pas non plus qu'il n'a pas l'air appétissant, je l'ai vu et il me semble très bien. Non, la raison pour laquelle je n'ai toujours pas goûté au fish & chips du Irish Embassy, c'est parce que le menu présente plusieurs autres options qui m'ont ravi à chaque fois. Par exemple, la bavette de boeuf style gaélique, la poutine au porc effiloché, le jarret d'agneau, le saumon à l'érable, le cari du jour ou le ragoût d'agneau. Les plats et la bière sont excellents, mais l'endroit manque légèrement d'ambiance le midi (en tout cas, les fois où j'y suis allé le midi). Par contre, le soir, c'est une autre histoire et c'est très chaleureux."}
{"text":"Decent pint of Guinness and the lamb stew was a good choice for a quick meal. And they didn't have Sheperd's Pie made with beef on the menu, which was a bonus!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine was visiting from Ottawa, and we decided to eat here last Saturday night.   I don't come here often, since all the previous times I've been here, it's been for drinks, and it was always crowded.  This time, I ACTUALLY got to sit down for dinner AND drinks. What a novelty!  The architecture IS great here, as previously mentioned. (One of my friends who attended on this night can attest. She's from Montreal, and says that location's like a cave.)  The food was okay - although our server kind of got my order wrong - she did apologize, but blamed it on the fact it was her birthday the night before (hint, hint).  My burger was decent. And maybe it was just the way I was holding it, but I SWEAR if it wasn't the perfect bun-to-meat ratio. The Caesar salad on the side was just enough.  As far as pubs go, I've been to better. But what can I say? My food came on time, it wasn't luke-warm in temperature, and I didn't find anything in it that I shouldn't have. It's definitely worth going to at least once."}
{"text":"Review only applies to brunch:  Got some basic breakfast food, bacon and eggs for one of us and eggs benedict for me.  Nothing spectacular, nothing wrong with it.  Not a particularly good deal.  The building is nice."}
{"text":"Before you read too far into my 4 stars please note I only had mixed drinks and waffle fries so really I can't comment too much.   I can say however that our waitresses were fantastic and attentive - very polite and accommodating. The hostess didn't look pleased to be there.   The place is a bit loud but it was a Friday night so it's expected. Crowd seemed fun. Very diverse mix of people.   The Good:  1. Staff. Friendly and attentive.  2. Prices. Definitely not overpriced.   The Bad:  1. Not a lot of beers on tap for an Irish pub. I was expecting a lot more.   Recommendation: waffle fries with garlic dip! Who doesn't love waffle fries, amirite?  I would suggest for casual drinks after work or if you want to catch a game (there are lots of TV).   The place is also pretty big so you should never wait too long for a table."}
{"text":"Forget booking for groups on a weekday...or any day for that matter. I organize events for my Alumni network once a month, and Irish Embassy came to mind as it's a good location and central for all.  I emailed a month ago to the web site \"info\" with no response. A week later I called and was told they don't handle group reservations and to email Dave the manager.   I emailed him, no response.  Fast forward to July 7th and I call as I haven't heard from anyone. They won't take my group of 8 at 6:30 pm , and according to Dave, no one in the downtown core will.  Well Dave, you leave me in a funny spot since you never emailed me back.  He says he did - I ask him to forward me that email (yes, I just called you out) he says he doesn't know if he can do that.  So, we can't reach a common ground and I book another venue downtown at 6:30pm for 8 people.   You just lost my group business for life."}
{"text":"Located within a stone's throw of King Subway Station (ok one block), I decided to visit this place for lunch and a drink.   It is situated in an the old Bank of British North America building's street level with much of its interior still intact.  High ceilings and walls probably modified from its original state.  That's the good.  Now the bad.  Once you arrive, you will be greeted at your table with some bread already left there.  It could be fresh bread from the day, but why would anyone place the bread at tables not already occupied.  I didn't even touch the bread.  Poor taste on their part.    The meal I ordered for lunch was a brie and sourdough grilled cheese sandwich with which I thoroughly enjoyed.    The service was lacking as it took quite a while to get our bill.    It's not a bad place to grab drinks after work.  But with plenty of choices in the Financial District, I'd go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Some of my coworkers recommended this place. So after a long grueling day at work I decided to stop by for some adult refreshments. After having three or four or six beers for appetizers I decided to order food from the menu. I had the cheesesteak and it was really good. It was so good I was truly shocked.  Waitresses were extremely nice especially if you're foreign (maybe it was my good looks, not ).  Atmospheres amazing, beer is awesome, food is exceptional especially for being barfood. Visit here and you won't be disappointed even if you are not trying to seek asylum like I was."}
{"text":"I've always loved the Irish Embassy.... great \"Irish\" poutine may not be authentic, but wow is it delicious!!  My greatest problem was the lack of security or actual comfort offered by the staff.  At one point in my last visit I had an individual come up to me and try and fight me and accuse me of being an Anti-Semite!!!! I was blown away.  After shaking his hand and assuring him it was a misunderstanding, the bullying continued.  He even went and hung out behind the bar with the staff and laughed while obviously still staring at me.  It was extremely uncomfortable and never felt like I didn't belong in this city before now.  Like I said, the food was great and I regret that I will probably avoid this establishment in the future because of this incident.  Ironically, I have written papers in the pro-Israeli variety in the past but that doesn't matter.  What does matter is that I was simply bullied by an individual who seemed to be a \"regular\" and was well known by a staff that did nothing about it."}
{"text":"Solid dinner for myself and the family. My bangers and mash was one of the best that I have ever had. My wife and son liked their fish and chips. Thankfully the beer menu included beers from Ireland and England as you would expect."}
{"text":"It is a loud bar where service is not as great We were here with friends once. The beer was ok, the food average, service a bit slow and not very organized There are similar options in the same area but as a different try, it is Ok"}
{"text":"It's a good place for a drink or two.   We went here after a Leafs game one night, and was first greeted by an exceptionally kind doorman. Once inside we were impressed by the decor and charm of the building. Once given the drink menu by our surly server, who's attitude we initially ignored, we ordered our drinks and food. I had a house salad with apple cider vinaigrette, and my other half had the turkey sliders. Both dishes were good-tasting; I especially liked the salad dressing. After our now-becoming-friendlier server came back for another drink order, we kinda joked with her a bit and that seemed to warm her up. After that she was polite and courteous, to us anyway.     We would return if visiting Toronto again, we liked the atmosphere, drink selection and food. Although our server wasn't the greatest off the bat, we're not going to let that ruin the rest of it and chalk that up to someone having a bad day."}
{"text":"came in for a late dinner (craving some MEAT) around 9:30PM on a Saturday and immediately loved the high domed ceilings and dim lighting. while the bar was quite busy, it was good to see they were still serving up plenty of food (and fast!) in the dining area.   the menu isn't terribly extensive but has a good variety; unfortunately for me the meatiest option was an appetizer of mini home-made sausages, which sounded bomb but didn't seem like it'd be filling enough. my GUINNESS BBQ SAUCE'd WINGS fit the bill (1lb of appetizer, wahoo!) and my date had his go-to: HADDOCK FISH AND CHIPS. wings were adequately saucy but the meat seemed dried out/overcooked in some places. the portion size of the haddock easily took up half the plate and ours happened to turn out in the shape of a fish (hehe). fries were nothing to write home about, coleslaw could have been zestier, but....the batter on the fish -- the crispy, airy batter -- was delightful.  silly me for thinking that an Irish Embassy in Toronto would ironically have a pub at street level...haha! but really, that'd be so fun ;)"}
{"text":"Great Irish pub! The Guinness was poured well and they had a great selection of food that was very traditional."}
{"text":"Been here for parties. They encourage fun having. Look at all those beers!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place.  Their Shepherd's pie used to be the best in the city.  This time, the pie was far from fresh, I could tell from the colour of the potatoes when it was served to me.  That bad.  It also tasted a bit sour, and I got sick from it.  Clearly, a very old pie.  NEVER going back, sadly."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in the Irish Embassy as we were site seeing on a Saturday afternoon.  Exterior gave the impression of a nice Irish pub.  They were serving brunch.  We were seated quickly and everyone was quite friendly.  I had the steak and eggs.  Steak was cooked as order.  Eggs were good.  Potatoes were average at best (seemed frozen, this is an Irish pub...).  I washed it down with a 20 ounce Steamwhistle draft.  My wife enjoyed soup and salad.  Prices for everything were fairly reasonable.  Service was excellent.  Food came out in less than 10 minutes.  Irish Embassy is a few blocks from the Air Canada Center and the Hockey Hall of Fame.  I wouldn't go out of my way to stop here again, but I would go back if in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"This is a sucking place . They over play the pub tactic to make people standing outside waiting In cold so that the line up makes them look super popular.  St. Patrick day, we waited for 1 hr. We saw many people came out periodically but they didn't let more customers in.  Finally, we were in.  What we saw was half of the place was empty, 1/3 of tables with chairs were available!!  They were definitely under utilIzation that should have let more people in, instead of making people standing outside to fake the popularity.  P.S. they don't have the green beer.  Will not return."}
{"text":"The Shaved Rib-Eye sandwich is a thumbs up. Good atmosphere if you don't mind drinking with a bunch of Habs fans."}
{"text":"Not bad. Kind of busy at lunch and dinner. I really like the lamb stew but find most of the other dishes average. The few times I've been here, the service was not the greatest."}
{"text":"Great martini's. Had their homemade sausage and chips as a finger food and it was delish! Atmosphere, meh, on the bright side I could hear my friends. Wasn't bad, for a Saturday night pre drink, I wouldn't stay there all night. I heard the after work crowd is awesome though..."}
{"text":"This place has the best servers and bartenders. Everyone was super friendly and one of the Irish bartenders recommended the bangers and mash which was excellent. As an English person I have been mislead with bangers and mash in Canada before but they get the bangers specially ordered from an Irish butcher.  I would highly suggest hitting this place for an after work drink at the bar."}
{"text":"I've been to the Irish Embassy several times. Its part of the Pat Quinn Empier that includes Quinn's, P.J O Brian's and Shopsy Deli (Oi)   The most recent occasion for my visit was a bachelor party on Saturday Night. There were 9 of us and we were ready to drink! I was planning on leading the group down to Mcveights (one of my favorite Irish spots in the city) but we wanted to stop somewhere close after not finding any tables at Earl's.  The headache was the service. They have a bouncer who was a bit gruff and as soon as we got inside we got read the riot act. Yes, we could have a table (the place was pretty empty) but don't even think about ordering at the bar or splitting the bills. This ultimatum was delivered by both the hostess and the waitress. All of this news was delivered in a tone that would make any Correctional Officer proud.   We bought a round of shots, a few drinks and were then promptly ignored... as the servers clustered around the serving station (within easy reach of our table) I understand maybe these servers did not want to be there, but this really reflects badly on the bar and of course, then our party didn't tip as well as we would have otherwise."}
{"text":"The Irish Embassy seems more like a factory or a giant sports bar than an Irish pub. Any pub I've been to in Ireland was small and quaint, or-- if it was in an old building they made use of the high ceilings and added a second floor. The IE seems empty and hollow to me. The service is more of the same... not very friendly or courteous. Efficient enough, I guess, but no warmth or personality. I've never wanted to stay and eat here. In fact-- even having drinks here has never been super fun. Probably won't be back unless friends insist that we meet here or something."}
{"text":"I've had lunch and after-work drinks here on numerous occasions.  Food is decent.  Your standard Irish pub fare.  The pie is good and so is the lamb stew.  I'd rank it slightly better than a Fionn's.  Guinness and Smithwicks is on tap, so is harp.  The pub itself has an very Irish feel to it right down to the black velvet on the chalkboard and the dress of the wait staff.  It's a nice alternative to the pretentiousness that some of the other financial district spots have.  ie. O&B, Earls, Keg.  The 2nd dining area is large enough so there are usually seats available.  They are missing a patio though."}
{"text":"I came after work on a Thursday night. It was jam packed with suits and we were lucky to get a table.  I had fish and chips and a beer.  Catching up with two friends from school was extremely difficult due to the cramped table and the loud atmosphere. The food was standard pub fare but nothing special. My bill was thirty dollars plus and for nothing special, I was not too pleased. It was great catching up with friends but when we get together again after work, it will be somewhere else."}
{"text":"You may not be able to renew your Irish passport at this Irish Embassy, but you certainly can get an interesting meal here. Aside from a burger, the menu appears authentically Irish and contains quite a few things you won't see on the average pub's menu. The quality of the food is very good, but also a little pricier than your average pub. There is a great selection of European beers on tap. It's a great place to go if you're tired of the standard pub food/beers."}
{"text":"Happy hour! Happy hour! Happy hour! Or shall I say Happy DAY since it runs from 11:30am-7pm?! You read right, my fellow drunks.  My new favourite downtown pub for great beers, great service, average bar food, and a fun band (that, in my experiences, plays old school favourites by The Smashing Pumpkins and other 90s awesomeness). Always a good time!  I'm a huge fan of their White Velvet and Snake Bite (White or Blonde beer with Cider). In the Summer and Fall (if it's not too cold or rainy) I like to sit outside, otherwise, the inside is really cozy, warm and dim, both of which make for a great ambiance."}
{"text":"Une belle surprise. On m'avait tellement dit que c'était coûteux. Au contraire, abordable, bon service, bonne bière. J'y retourne."}
{"text":"Service and food were great; rarely had an empty glass. The atmosphere is perfect for an after work hangout, or a date night. Plenty of TVs in the bar area for watching hockey.   Only con was that the bathroom was down a flight a stairs in the .. basement? But otherwise it was a great experience."}
{"text":"*2nd Review*  Came here on a separate occasion for dinner with my sister after happy hour drinks from Trevor Bar & Kitchen on a weekday.  Although the ceilings are high, it was pretty loud since the restaurant was pretty full with other dinners and people at the bar.  My sister is the type that like variety when eating out, so we ordered 2 appetizers and 1 entrée to share.  We ended up ordering Chicken Wings, Pulled Pork Sliders and Fish and Chips.  Chicken Wings ($12) - 1LB - Guinness BBQ sauce.  Wings were not breaded, Guinness BBQ sauce was kind of bland, neither sweet, tangy, nor smoky.  Comes with celery, carrots and blue cheese to dip.    Pulled Pork Sliders ($12) - slow roast Ontario pork shoulder & house coleslaw.  Comes with three sliders, This was pretty good as the bbq sauce in this was much better tasting than the Guinness BBQ sauce used for the wings.  Pulled pork was tender, and the coleslaw on top added some crunch to it.  This item was the best part of our meal.  Fish and Chips ($17) - Kilkenny Battered Haddock, fresh cut fries, house coleslaw & homemade tartar sauce.  Breading on the fish was on point, fried golden brown and was moist.  The homemade tartar sauce and coleslaw was good as well.  Fries were not as crisp as I would have liked.    Again, typical pub food, not great, not bad.    *1st Review*  Came here for weekday lunch with my co-worker.  Wasn't too busy when we got there.  I ordered the Ontario Beef Cottage Pie.  My co-worker ordered the fish that was on special, I believe it was Arctic Char.    After placing our orders, I noticed one of the chef's came out and started talking to one of the customer's behind me about Raptors basketball.  I turned around and it was Jack Armstrong (Sportscaster for the Toronto Raptors).  Being a Raptors fan, I had to get a picture with him at the end of our meal.  My co-worker didn't know who he was but got a picture with him as well.  Ontario Beef Cottage Pie ($16) - Carrots, Peas, & Corn Topped With Roasted Garlic Mashed Potatoes.  It was baked in the oven which gave the mashed potatoes on top a bit of a crust.  Typical pub food, not great, not bad.  Came with a side of salad.    Highlight of the meal was taking a picture with Jack at the end.  Most notable Jack Armstrong quotes:  \"HELLOOOO!!!\"  \"GET THAT GARBAGE OUTTA HERE\""}
{"text":"Irish embassy is easily one of my group of friends' go-to bar for weekends. It is always a safe bet when looking for a relaxed night out with beer, maybe some food and a quality live band. Their beer selection is good enough that anyone will find something to their liking. Their sweet potato fries are amazing. However, in my experience, their food is not the greatest - for example, their hamburger was very dry and tasteless.   Overall, this place is better for beer and appetizers than it is for dinner."}
{"text":"Great spot in MTL.Great Pub, food, live band. Good pub atmosphere.  Has a big patio in the summer, front and private in the back.  Foods good but I think their menu is smaller than a few years ago..  Had their burger there the other day.. SOOOO GOOD.  They asked how I would like it cooked! YES.. finally! A place that grinds it's own meat. Pretty sure there was some lamb meat in the patty. A great \"Irish\" Pub meal. It was juicy and delish!!  Staff is sometimes a little rude, but it's a bar, so what else would you expect!  A top pub as a must see in MTL for sure!"}
{"text":"I dislike this place for the same reason that I dislike suburbs, SUVs, wal-marts and The Eagles.  Unfortunately,  I don't know what that reason is.  So, I'm giving Irish Embassy a three star rating.     First off, as others have said, there's pretty much nothing Irish about this place that is Irish, except the TV cameras and crowd control services that arrive every March 17.  The interior is initially impressive because of its groin vault ceilings, but these ceilings tend to make the room very loud.  It's also loud because its proximity to Toronto's bank towers ensure that the place is constantly full.  Suits abound.  The food here is respectable.  Everything is predictably nice and made with ingredients of decent quality.  Nothing adventurous or interesting, really.  The dishes here are designed to ensure that no one needs to spend any time thinking about food much.   You're here to network.  Eating is a secondary concern.  TV monitors in every direction ensure you always have a way of restarting a stalled conversation.    So it's not really my cup of tea, but it is easy to direct people to, and I had a great time catching up with an old friend here.  So, it serves its purpose well."}
{"text":"Back in town for work nearby.  This is a solid choice for festive crowds (very busy on a cold Monday) and a good place for the beer/pub experience.  Still, the food was merely ho-hum.  I ordered the evening special, an 8-oz steak with truffle potatoes and assorted veggies.  Medium, please.  After a wait, it was delivered slightly well done, with a patty of herbed butter that for some reason never melted.  The long thin steak sat upon two perfect scoops of mashed potatoes, which were highly infused with truffle oil.  The veggies were another breast mold of bell pepper and carrots.   Nothing was bad, but there was nothing really harmonious either, and the truffle oil often dominated.   Usually Irish pubs fall into three camps:    1..  They don't care about the food, for the money is in the drinks.  2.   They work hard to deliver unique gastro pub fare  3.  They stay focused on really good traditional fare.    The Embassy is a beaut of a pub, but I'm not sure which camp they want to be in when it comes to food."}
{"text":"I don't know why this place has mediocre ratings, but I had a great experience here in large group. Service was quick and high quality. The burger was SO good and not overpriced. The soup that came with it was great as well. Overall a great restaurant that I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"It's alright..the waitstaff leaves something to be desired..and the people..well the people are an odd mix of financial men and then the mangey types who feed of the finance industry.  It's not my favourite spot and I wouldnt' pick it if it weren't so conveniently in my neighbourhood. But hey, it plays the hockey game, they have drinks, and average food.  well, i'd almost say below average food but it's pubfare so one can't expect too much. The environment is, again..quite something.  I get that it's an old bank building..and I get that it's supposed to be charming.. but for some reason, it just really isn't."}
{"text":"Fun place with an assortment of drinks and interesting items on the menu. We came in to watch some of the Blue Jays vs Red Sox game and were sure it'd be packed but it was very quiet. Our waitress was super sweet and very attentive. I went with a mimosa and my partner had a Guiness. Drinks were very reasonably priced. For brunch, he had the shellfish quiche with a side of black pudding while I went with the buttermilk pancakes and a side of their cole slaw which sounded great on the menu but turned out to be kind of bitter with nothing apple tasting. The rest of the meal was great. Toward the end, they sat a huge group by us that blocked the television so we decided to wrap it up. One other thing that bothered me was they would take the plates away immeditely, the moment we appeared done and I felt slightly rushed despite the fact it wasn't crowded at all."}
{"text":"I've been here twice today, once for dinner and now for a late night snack, was a bit concerned about the Yelp reviews, my concerns were unfounded, most excellent food , great bartenders, made me feel at home all the way from California, can't wait to knock a few back here next time I visit Toronto."}
{"text":"If you want a loud place with a decent atmosphere to drink in then this place is ok. If you want to eat, then this is not the place for you. I spent $12 on a supposed \"pound\" of the smallest, most flavourless wings that I'v ever eaten. I ordered it from a short crappy menu that might as well have been writen on a napkin."}
{"text":"We came here last night with a few friends for dinner and drinks. There was nothing great about this the experience, except that the building itself is beautiful, with high ceilings.  Our waitress was not attentive and did not fill our water glasses once. She disappeared for the last 30 minutes that we were at the table and took 15 minutes to bring the bill.  The food was decent. I had the Cajun chicken sandwich that had a mix of tender chicken and some tough pieces. The sauce on the sandwich was good and you can't go wrong with bacon! The drinks were disappointing. $15 for a Moscow mule on special, that had so much ginger beer that it was spicy and cleared my head.  Overall, I'd come here for a beer before a hockey game and that's about it."}
{"text":"It was friday night and a group of us were visiting Montreal.  Didn't really want to do any hardcore partying downtown so decided to seek beer and something low key.  Irish Embassy is your normal pub-like establishment that just puts you in the mood to drink beer and pick on some wings.  Nothing special about the the food or beer selection here.  Busy, seat yourself type atmosphere thats a little noisy, but that's to be expected on a friday night.  Bottom line:  Comfortable, dim, noisy and fun.  We left buzzed and happy."}
{"text":"This place was another stop in my friends barhopping bachelorette night. They have some awesome cider as well as a sweet back terrace. I would definitely go back there just to chill out on the terrace in the summer. The staff is friendly and professional. The ambiance is nice and pubby with a lot of wood furniture. My friends and I had a great time here :)"}
{"text":"Awesome service and desserts! Everyone is very nice. Great place to go when you are hungry."}
{"text":"I don't go to pubs often, but somehow ended up there for a school reunion.  The interior is very cozy, with sturdy wooden tables and benches, and dim, warm lights. Most patrons were much older than I was, and I kind of felt like a kid in there. I was given a free drink ticket for the event. I didn't feel like alcohol, so the waitress recommended their fruit punch. She brought me a tall glass of Bora Bora-like mocktail (without the ginger ale). It was very good.   I can't tell much about the quality of the food or service because I only stayed for about half and hour, but the Irish Embassy Pub & Grill seems like a perfectly good pub. The staff was very nice and diligent. I actually forgot my umbrella there that evening, and they kept it for me to pick up the following day.  They have a nice outdoor sitting-area behind the pub, but I think it's closed for the winter."}
{"text":"Convenient Irish pub with decent bar food.  I would NOT recommend the fish and chips unless you like heavy thick batter with bland taste.  Highly recommended is their bacon lardo and spicy mayo topped with cheddar poutine, and the grilled chicken sandwich with cheddar and arugula sandwich. Don't forget to leave room for a glass of whiskey and beer."}
{"text":"It was a beautiful early spring AM in Toronto with the temperature hovering around -2C with a nice brisk wind bringing the Temp down a little more.. Ahhh spring in Toronto... So when the Embassy appeared and offered warmth, breakfast, and bloodies.. Perfect!!  Service was excellent and the traditional English breakfast fortified me for the day. Would love to return for dinner and music on my next visit."}
{"text":"The waiters were difficult to wave down, and I paid $30 for a mediocre pitcher of Sangria which was half ice, half drink! There was live music...which was sort of awful rock. I couldn't justify paying $11 for nachos, so I didn't try any of the food."}
{"text":"Let me just get straight to the point and say; cocktail list, wow. They have a mah--oo-sive list of cocktails. Having worked my through most of said list, they are divine. This place makes a mean Long Island Ice Tea.   As for the beer/Guinness...I have never tried but I hear good things!  Atmosphere/decor: I really quite like the bank feeling this place has going on. This place is always super busy. Note for single ladies of Yelp land, once the working day is over this place is suit central!  Food: well it is ok. I was here at the weekend and I swear the menu has been cut down, maybe not...but it looked like it to me! I ate here with friends that are vegetarian...not much to choose from at all!  That said I like this place on a week day evening. There is a certain buzz. that just keeps me coming back here."}
{"text":"Nice irish pub. But the most noticeable trait is how good the food is! If you're going to the pub at supper time, Irish embassy is definitely the best option around."}
{"text":"I was here, I found that our server was pretty rude. The ambiance was annoying, the beer was pretty standard fare, and the food did not look like anything special. All in all I didn't enjoy my experience at this pub at all. I did this pub on a pub crawl, and it was by far the worst pub of the lot."}
{"text":"Hit or miss. The Fish n' chips are consistently good, generally go there for my cheap quick craving filler. Typical pub food. The fries are tasty, pretty sure it's because they fry them in the same oil as the fish, although I did have a few bad batches, but good overall. As I said, hit or miss, your recollection will depend on how many pints you have and how many shots are offered to you. I will go back. 4 stars for great value to $ spent."}
{"text":"Went here on a date.  I don't know why I had not been in here before.  Anyone that lives or works near the core must pass by this resturant dozens of times a year.  I guess I also assumed it would just be a place for tourists.  First things first--the good news is that it is in a former bank which means it is pretty cool inside.  The bad news is that it is in a former bank.  The acoustics are horrific.  It was so loud.  I had a hard time making myself heard.    Cloth napkins and the staff uniforms that give this place a touch of class; it is certainly a little bit more upscale than other places pretending to be Irish pubs.  The beer selection is really no better than what you would find at a chain pub.  Prices are a little higher though although I did think my fish and chips was better than I've had in a while.    I suspect I would not return, at least if the choice were entirely up to me.  The central location is handy.  It is hard to recommend this for a date due to the noise.  Maybe it is place you go to with the office mates for lunch or drinks.  I assume it gets busy on Friday and Saturday nights although you might need to turn up your hearing aid."}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying, I can't speak on the food at the Irish Embassy Pub and Grill.   We decided to stop in for some drinks after dinner on Thanksgiving. That being said, the place was not busy.  The drinks were excellent, but were expensive.   The staff was very friendly, however it told FOREVER to get a simple drink of water, even after we spent A LOT on drinks.   The atmosphere was pleasant, clean and welcoming!"}
{"text":"Had dinner with a friend last night at the Irish Embassy pub. I hadn't been there in a few years. The service was great, the food was okay in my opinion (I had a burger which was just okay; my friend had the Cajun chicken sandwich which she really enjoyed). The dessert was to die for: sticky toffee pudding which was recommended by our server as it was popular and made in-house. She was absolutely spot-on. The ambiance is quite nice but even at half-full, it was quite noisy. We peeked into the Dublin Lounge which was next door - a smaller, more relaxed venue which offers the same menu. I would definitely go back but I would probably stick to the usual: fish n' chips, etc."}
{"text":"So this lived up to expectations.  We wanted Guinness and Harp on tap along with good pub food and got just that.  The prime rib sandwich was delicious.  The chicken wrap was huge and the grilled brie cheese was a pleasant (and tasty) treat.  Sandwiches were a bit on the pricey side, but not bad with awesome fries.  The atmo is a brightly lit pub space and although crowded with business and tourist lunches all around, service was prompt.  All in all a great lunch stop."}
{"text":"I'm not entirely sure why, but I love this place and make sure to have at least one Guinness here every time I'm in Toronto. The Guinness is good (not outstanding but very good) and I'm into the traditional suit-and-tie-financial-feel of the place. Around Christmas it's beautiful in here with tasteful evergreen wreaths and classy touches of red. The bar is huge, reflected by a mirror and the dining room is surprisingly formal for a Yonge St bar. I've always found the staff delightful and even when it's crowded you can usually still order your drink in a reasonable time frame. We have eaten here a couple of times and found it to be average and a tad pricey. Shepherds pie is okay. Go here for the central location, the bustling business atmosphere, good service and a well-poured Guinness."}
{"text":"Great place to have a beer or a specialty cocktail. Food is decent, nothing too special but a great time if you want to enjoy a good atmosphere with some good people"}
{"text":"I wanted a chill place to have a drink after a big dinner and this place did the trick. There was a live band playing my favorite tunes and the drink prices were great. It's a big place so we were able to sit a little ways from the stage and still have a conversation without yelling. It wasn't too crowded for a Friday night which was nice!"}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoy Irish Embassy, the ambiance is great and the whiskey choice is excellent. The food is good pub fare and the service is good too! I have been here with large 25+ people groups and with a couple friends and we are never disappointed...great live music and great fun until the wee hours of the morning!"}
{"text":"On a cold March night in Toronto, I decided the best thing to do was leave the hotel room and go get some drinks.  The Irish Embassy Pub and Grill is absolutely beautiful. From the moment you step in you are ready to Irish up! I had a few Guinness, Smithwicks and Kilkenny beers. So tasty and cold...with some Irish music playing in the background, it made for a memorable last night on my trip to this great city. Check out this place...the food looked amazing, but unfortunately I was only here to get my drink on."}
{"text":"With it being called Irish Embassy Pub & Grill, I was thinking it wouldn't be too slow of me to assume that it would be an Irish pub inside. I was a little disappointed to find it was far more of a sports bar not the authentic Irish pub I was hoping for when I walked in.  The beer selection was just ok as was the service. I had a far better experience at PJ O'brien's with not only selection but also much more social staff.  In an effort not to be a total Debbie Downer, the building itself is quite impressive architecturally, and the less than stellar (read snotty and obnoxious) crowd that was there was probably just a by-product of Friday happy hour."}
{"text":"Service is a little slow but the food is good. I know it's an Irish place but if you aren't from Canada, try the Steam Whistle beer.  Had the shepherd's pie...super hot so let it cool down a bit first or order a sandwich or appetizer if you're really hungry and can't wait."}
{"text":"When my friends and I realized we weren't overly hungry and ordered appetizers and drinks only, we were snarked at by the waitress for taking up a table.  An email to the \"info\" address on their website produced no response.  I would suggest that customer service is the least of their priorities, and returning to this establishment is the least of mine."}
{"text":"The Irish Embassy is a bar, not an actual embassy.  Just thought I should clarify as I start writing.  It's a pub/bar, but a very classy one.  The architecture is great, look up after you sit down.  Beer is cold and I hear they serve food too. I wouldn't know about that.  The crowd here is very business.  Even late at night it seem that you get a lot of young business professionals there.  It's very clean, washrooms are good...not like your usual home town pub.  It's a bit more upscale.    So it makes the perfect place to bring customers, dates, or friends you want to impress.  You can't go wrong here whether you are dressed up or just casual."}
{"text":"I'm really not sure what to think of this place. I find just about everything ok. It's not my favorite downtown Irish pub, but I still find myself there from time to time. The food is fine, it's just better elsewhere. Ideally I would have given them 3 and a half stars, but sadly...   However... if you're planning on going there with a large group and having about 4 stones of ale then I'm sure you'll love it.   PS: They have a great terrace in the front which should buy them another star in my review, but it's February, so it won't;)"}
{"text":"As we visited Toronto over the holidays, we had the opportunity to have dinner on the same day the Buffalo Bills played their over-the-border game (and were soundly defeated) at the Irish Embassy Pub & Grill.   The corner location, old world building exterior, high ceiling, close seating interior combined with the dinner crowd, including many dissapointed Bills fans, was fun and entertaining. We ordered traditional Irish fare, Corned Beef and Cabbage, and it was good but as they say, 'nothing to write home about.' The portions normal, the price above normal, the service, again, normal.  However, I was told repeatedly the beer was very good."}
{"text":"A historic establishment turned Irish pub situated in the financial district. Most of the clienteles are within 25-40, most dressed casually. It's always nice to be able to enjoy historic sites and eat at the same time.  It's tricky when ordering food in a pub. It's hard to expect anything half decent as business revolves around alcohol. But took a shot at it.  Oh, and complimentary bread came. Cold, to say the least. Hate it when restaurants do that.  Ordered: Jerk Pulled Chicken with red peppers flatbread - This one was alright, though the amount of black pepper they put in masks the flavour of the chicken.  Kilkenny Battered Haddock - Came with the traditional coleslaw, tartar sauce and fries. Average at best. Came lukewarm. Argh!  Services was friendly and attentive, Came by from time to time to check in.  Note:  Prices are decent, but my best suggestion is to stick with the alcohol."}
{"text":"I love this place! Straight to the point--- Friendly staff.  Great Service & Music. Live Bands Thursday - Sunday. Cool Atmosphere. Yummy Food. (Pulled-pork Sandwhich, Guiness Wings, Hamburgers.. ) Wide Variety of Alcohol/Beer. Good Price. :) Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I've past by the place numerous times and it's a craving that has finally been fulfilled.  First off this place exhibits the looks of an old bank (which is was) colossus corinthian pillars, marble floors, walls, tall windows, and all the specs of you typical financial building.   At first you'd expect this place to be a lot bigger, but the way the pub is layed out is perfect!! they've maximized the space without making it seemed crammed :)  Our server was extrememly polite, and knowledgable....which is key in my books...nothing worse than not knowing you own menu lol!!  For drinks I just had carbonated water..sorry..still at work so no alchy...   Food...their lunch menu options are not bad, but i decided to have their decadent Double Brie sour dough grilled cheese sandwich! I have a weakness for cheese lol..  Hell was it RICH!! thank goodness I opted for Salad over fries or id be wheelbarrelled out from being full.. Granny Smith Apples covered with melted Double Cream Quebec brie, sweet chutney.....man was it foodgasm!..........served with a light house salad :) this was a 4/5...   DOwnside I wish it was slightly bigger...it looked like something homemade. In addition for the price of that grilled cheese $15 is a rip lol...quite frankly. but again its the financial district...soooo .......... but it was near perfect though!!!"}
{"text":"WORST service and very poor attitudes from several staff, especially the main hostess. Went there for the first time with a group of 10 people last Sunday night. We were immediately told it would be \"a hassle\" to move around tables to accommodate our group, and we should try to avoid being \"loud\". We were told not to bother asking for separate bills because they won't do that. A couple people went straight to the bar to order, and we were asked to tell them not to order there because the staff couldn't transfer that bill either. The hostess was incredibly rude and condescending, and not only will I never go back to Irish Embassy, I will be strongly encouraging anyone I meet to go ANYWHERE else!"}
{"text":"great pub near King and Yonge. They have high ceilings which I really like. Service was great and drinks are standard. Will come back here if I am in the area."}
{"text":"Came here for a late lunch with my wife. Pretty good food. Chicken Asparagus soup was great. Put a spin on a Cobb salad, very tasty. Good beer selection. Had a Spellmans, pretty good trying it for first time. Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Came here after work around 5.30. It was packed with men in suits... I hate men in suits. Unless you're Harvey Specter, then I want to kidnap you and drug you and make babies on a regular basis.  Everyone was stuck up -ish. I personally am not a fan of any bars/restaurants around the entertainment/business district. Overpriced, small portions, snotty staff, and business men are kinda gross...they stare and drool because I guess their housewives don't really rock it for them anymore? ANYHOOO  I got the Irish poutine. There was bacon and mayo and cheese and it was just sooooo greasy! Every time I swallowed I felt the food slide down a slippery slope of grease. Kinda delicious though, the first two bites anyway!  My friend got the Irish nachos, and as I usually do, I had half of them cuz she couldn't finish. They're made with waffle fries which is an awesome idea for those who cant decide between nachos/poutine and fries. They had corn, beef, onions, tomatoes, sour cream and salsa dips, and we got guac on the side. Also good, nothing really special though.  Our bill was around 80 bucks with 3 beers and a diet coke, plus a chicken wrap. I can't say that I was satisfied, I mean I only ate one and a half things?!?!!? Beer was expensive too, not cool Embassy...not cool. But I guess you've got King size rent to pay with that location...  Very nice inside, I guess this is what classier Irish pubs look like? Bathrooms were clean. I would come back, if someone was paying for me hehe...I feel like lately most of my reviews end with that line? But dammit, why should I be paying when YOU get to reap the benefits of drunk Anastasiya!!?!?"}
{"text":"Cool looking place, and always busy.  The food is a little better than most pubs in the city but is overpriced the same.  The beers are beers.  Its irish pub meets the financial district."}
{"text":"We came to Toronto for our 2 year anniversary. Sunday being our last day, we decided to go out for drinks. We went here the morning of Dec. 18 for brunch, and our service was fantastic. But when night time came around, it was not. While a lot of places were closed on a Sunday, we decided to go with this one again. Our drinks were good, weren't watered down or anything. But our server (Lise I think, she never told us her name but I caught a glimpse when looking at the bill) barely checked up on us, with not that many tables in the building. We had to wait about 5-10 mins or more to get a refill on our drinks (this was AFTER we were already finished with them and waiting for her to come check on us to order another) and being a server in the restaurant industry, I know that this is not an average time frame for drinks. We were checked on maybe twice in the 1-2 hours we were there. Poutine was delicious though!"}
{"text":"I've visited this establishment a few times. The most recent last Friday after the concert. Although it is larger than it appears, it is also appears crowded easily......  Dinners, after work drinks, and overall drinks are well served with no real outstanding dish or drink."}
{"text":"Chain bar.  The drunkards equivalent to east side mario's.  Soon enough there will be highchairs and colouring books at every table, shitty renditions of the happy birthday song to follow.   Go across theparkibg lot to Huley's."}
{"text":"Came here with my sister one night and had a near perfect experience. The staff was friendly and helpful, from the girls working the door, to our awesome waitress and even one of the bartenders who pointed me to the location of the restrooms.  Place was packed but we didn't have to wait for a table. Waitress was there in no time to take our drink orders. She was clearly swamped but super efficient, and we were eating food in no time. I wish I could remember what I ordered, but I know it was filling and quite tasty -- I'm 90% sure it was the Shepard's Pie, which I believe was one of their signature dishes, as it should be at all pub-like establishments.  The place itself is quite impressive -- it's an old bank building from the late 1800s. The ceilings must have been about 100 feet high. It's been a while since I've been but I do recall the waitress being great and the food to be quality. The two most important things!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times.  It's always busy, so if you know you're coming, make a reservation!    This place gives you a more of an upscale pub feel without the pretension, and with all of your favourite Irish pub eats and drinks.  The service and food are both great.  I've had the Irish nachos, the Cottage pie, and Spinach Dip.  The portions are always large.    It's a good place to watch a sports game, a drink after work or have a meal before a concert."}
{"text":"I got charged 99 cents, each, for a packet of mayo!   I know, it sounds like I'm a cheapo, but when you ask for mayo and they give you two packets, only to see. 99 cents (x2) added in your bill, that's not cool. Is mayo really that expensive that you have to charge for it? Or wouldn't you at least say there's a charge for it? I just don't like unknown charges popping up on my bill because it wasn't mentioned it'll be added in.   OK, rant over.   We got the hipster meal. The burger looked small, but it was actually pretty filling. I was filled because of the fries. The fries are good.   The burger itself is delicious! The patty is surprisingly a lot bigger, compared to how it overall looks like. I wish the burger bun was toasted though or heated or something. It was like they grabbed the bun from the package and used it, without any effort to revive the flattened soul. For $15, I would have expected a better bun treatment.   We also order potato nachos. It's basically nachos but they used potatoes. It's a neat concept. We were too full with our meal so we barely had it. We ordered it after the hipster meal, but we were actually full by the time we got it. As I said, the burger itself was small, but looks can be deceiving I guess. Or, it could be that we drowned our belly with iced tea. We appreciated the bottomless iced tea.   The service was ok. The lady was nice, but our food took a really long time to come in. Granted, they were packed, so it's understandable. Just anticipate a really long wait if you see a full house.   I wouldn't mind going here again. I wouldn't blacklist it, but I wasn't exactly impressed."}
{"text":"A decent spot for a late night pint.  Nothing really differentiates this from other Irish pubs.  Food is not standout.  There is live music on weekends.  Popular with the after work crowd in the area only because there isn't anything for a few blocks in either direction.  Better bet would be to hit Biermarkt on The Esplanade a few blocks south.  Or if you are dressed for it, the bar at Bymark a few blocks west."}
{"text":"When you walk in, you realize this place has history. This is a great spot to go to for a good pint of Guinness and great service. Great for small groups as well. Very friendly environment.   4.24/5 *"}
{"text":"This former bank keeps a lot of the old décor and feel of the old bank with very ornate and antiquated trim, vaulted ceilings, and very posh table settings.  So, when the \"Irish pub\" feel tries to settle in, it seems a bit out of place, but still seems to work.  This would be the younger-yet-bigger brother pub to P.J. O'Brien's (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/p-j-obriens-toronto), and is definitely a bit more upscale, looking for the suits to come in directly from the bank for a Guinness.  The menu is stepped up a bit from P.J.'s as well, but is still decently Irish-themed.  You're still able to get the mini-sausages that they sell by the shed-load at P.J.'s (you'll have to ask) and the food tastes good and authentic.  If I were you I'd go for the brunch where you're able to get eggs, sausage, and both types of pudding (white and black).  Really tasty.  I've also been for, erm, \"client meetings\" where after six hours of drinking Guinness, we found ourselves trying to divide the bill up so that we could each expense the \"meal\" to our respective employers.  The staff are very accommodating in that regard, God love 'em."}
{"text":"Solid place to grab a pint if you're downtown near the Hockey Hall of Fame, though the service was spotty at best on a night when it wasn't particularly crowded. Decor makes you feel like you just walked into a Canadian episode of Mad Men. Drinks are strong but the highlight here is the people watching. Worth going to if only because it's reasonably priced compared to other downtown options."}
{"text":"A great Irish pub located in the heart of the downtown core, Irish Embassy does a great job at getting away from your typical pub food.   Here on the menu you can find specials like: fried chicken and waffles, beer can chicken, fish and chips, and corned beef sandwich.  Try the corned beef sandwich!  They have a vast selection of beers on tap, pour an okay pint of Guiness and are a great place to catch a Canadiens game, or just grab some drinks and dinner before the game.   On Canadiens game nights, you will find the Team 990 crew doing a live pre and post game feed. And as hard as it may believe because of the size and amount of seats - it does does get filled up fairly quickly on game nights."}
{"text":"My friend tipped me off that this joint has Kilkenny Irish Ale, my favorite beer--which I cannot get in the United States.  Then when I booked my hotel I found that this was three blocks away, so I found myself in here twice during my short stay.  As it turned out, lots of bars had Kilkenny, but I came here anyway.  It certainly is handsomely decorated, and much has been made of the old bank setting.  However, I feel that the layout is a detraction:  basically you have a big, square, open room.  This leads to a lot of noise and a wide-open, airy sort of aesthetic; basically the antithesis of a classic Irish pub.  In fact, it feels more like a restaurant and not at all like a pub.  They have a lot of standard two- and four-top tables and a few high round tables, but no traditional pub seating.  No snugs, no booths, etc.  With the numerous TVs and the loud buzz, it feels really like a fancy Irish sports bar and grill.  But that's okay if that's what you're in the mood for--just don't go expecting a traditional pub.  I spent a couple of hours here over two nights, and had a few good pints and an Irish whiskey.  They have about a dozen of the former and two dozen of the latter.  There were several intriguing varieties that I'd never heard of but I had been wanting to try the Bushmills 1608 (400th anniversary edition) and it did not disappoint.  Silky-smooth, honey, clove, caramel...mmm.    One final note bumps them to four stars:  my last night in town I approached the manager to see if I they would sell me a Kilkenny pint glass, telling him of my love of the brand.  He went behind the bar, took a clean one, and handed it to me--gratis--saying \"Cheers, enjoy.\"  What a generous and totally unexpected gesture.  I would have been happy to pay a fair price for it.  That really tickled me pink."}
{"text":"I was surprised by how much I enjoyed my dinner here. I came in with average expectations and they were met and even exceeded. Waitress was attentive and helpful with recommendations, and gave me lots of water re-fills, which I always appreciate.  My date loved his steak (he said it was better than the one he had ordered at The Keg a few nights earlier), and I was A-OK with the huuuuuge cut of haddock that was my fish and chips (though I don't know if I'd get it again -- the portion was so big I couldn't finish it, and the grease from the chips and fries was a bit much .. def not appealing as leftovers).  To be honest, I probably would've never ended up here without LivingSocial in hand, but it was a solid meal downtown and I'd recommend the restaurant to anyone looking for a nice, quiet dinner (on weeknights, that is). Lots of dates, single businessmen and families when we were dining."}
{"text":"This is a sad story.   I have a sweet spot for this pub, not least because a good friend used to work here before moving away.   The other day I passed by right before the kitchen closed with some friends. I got myself a sizzling pile of fat, plump spicy chicken wings. I mowed through about half the pile with delight, and got the rest boxed up to go. While waiting outside after, I was startled and disturbed by the the sight of two fat, plump rats scurrying down the road and diving through a crack below the bar. The (evil) person I was with made the inevitable comparison between the rat rumps and the delectable chicken legs I'd just been feasting on. And the leftovers have been sitting sadly in my fridge even since. Inedible through no fault of their own.   I never see rats in Montreal but I know they are there. They are in every city. I don't even mind them in certain contexts - I took a road trip with a rat this one time... but that's another story. I don't blame Irish Embassy - I blame the evil friend - I'm sure the Embassy's kitchen is highly hygienic. And yet. Gulp. Cringe. Shudder. Ahk. The damage is done. My over-active imagination needs time to heal, and the once-loved leftovers are doomed for the bin. I told you this was a sad story."}
{"text":"Had dinner here while on a business trip in March 2013, with a party of eight. The liquid refreshments were great! Irish beer selections on tap!! Dinner was good, with most of us going with seafood selections. Our wait staff took very good care of us."}
{"text":"Looking for a spot for some good food and fast service before a concert at ACC, we tried out Irish Embassy at the corner of Yonge and Wellington. You can park at the Hockey Hall of Fame, walk a short distance for dinner then walk underground all the way to the ACC.   Like several places, the hostess would not have been my choice as the first point of contact. You know, the kind that seems cold and walks you over to the worst table for two in the place. Right past many much better high top tables at the bar. But once seated, things got a lot better.   We had the poutine which was awesome, the bangers and mash and the Irish lamb stew, both were also very good. They have a great selection of beers and the menu has something for everyone. The Irish stew was on the Signature Dishes and it was delicious with tender chunks of lamb and two pieces of good bread.   Overall he wait staff service was excellent and while the place is very big with many areas, I can see why reservations would be good. Glad we tried this spot which is now a good alternative to Marche and a few other restaurants close to the ACC for quick service and good food."}
{"text":"I was dragged here to watch some stupid sports game. Already you can tell I don't care for sports, right? Anyways, it was actually a nice time. Because it was the Canadiens vs. Bruins it was packed, just like every other pub in the city.  It was also surprisingly much quieter than any Boston pub/sports bar i've been to during any game night.  Luckily we found a table quickly outside in their \"beer garden\" which is what it reminded me of. The weather was perfect that night so it was very nice to sit out in the open air.  We ordered wings and drinks which all came out pretty quickly. The wings were downright amazeballs. We had the guinness bbq which were OK, but the honey garlic and spicy asian wings were soooo gooooood. I think we finished each pound in about 2 minutes. Our waitress was very attentive, bringing water without being asked etc. I love that."}
{"text":"Came here for fish-n-chips and a Guinness, since I was staying across the street at the Victoria Hotel.  The Guinness was a perfect pour and a welcome refreshment on a warm day. Definitely a good choice if you like a good Irish Pub. The fish was a large tasty filet, and had a perfect, crispy batter coating. The chips were good and the portions were large enough that you're likely to leave here quite full. Service was good too, and they had the Euro game on all the tv's."}
{"text":"I may be a little biased about the food here. We came in for lunch at 4pm when we were starving and cold from walking outside in the snow. So being in a warm place eating warm food made everything seemed super delicious.   We had the lamb stew with a nice baguette. My friend said it was good. Looked really hearty and nice sized chunks of meat.   The Guiness BBQ wings were smokey and tangy. Portion size was pretty good though wings were on the smaller side  Black bean soup was really good. Served in a large bowl, it was nicely seasoned and filling.   Different sports were playing on multiple screens, the atmosphere is social and service is pretty fast. We were in and out in under an hour."}
{"text":"Went here while staying overnight in Toronto. Good burgers. A good place to grab a quick bite and a few drinks. Quick service and nice size place. Didn't have to wait for a table which was a huge plus."}
{"text":"Friendly place, Allison at the bar was very nice and helpful with \"things to do and see in Toronto\". The chicken wings were excellent, good place a pint and a bite."}
{"text":"The food was typical pub food but not bad, would eat here again. It's a good atmosphere and enjoyable by yourself or in groups.   I would come here again when back in Toronto."}
{"text":"Worth a visit!  Here's my top 5 points about this place: 1) Ambiance and architecture of the building is great 2) Good place for after work drinks 3) Close to the subway 4) Many nice restos around if you want to move on to a meal after drinks here 5) Yummy pub like food especially the burgers  The only downside I found was the service. Each time I go, I find the servers to be a little pushy."}
{"text":"I came here for weekend brunch because I had a $10 off coupon. The location is great -- right by Union Station and it is pretty much your typical Irish-style pub. Casual, friendly, standard fare, and lots of big TV's playing different sports & the news.   I had their omelette of the day which came with pancetta, a 4 cheese blend, onions, and asparagus. It came with a nice portion of green salad and some hash browns, plus toast. I like that you get both salad and hash browns! DC had the haddock fish & chips - nothing to write home about but pretty good. Service was good but a little on the slow side. Still, coffee was re-filled and the orange juice was fresh (not the gross Minute Maid variety that some places serve).   This strip of Yonge isn't great for food options, so if you're looking for something simple then Irish Embassy is a decent option."}
{"text":"I got to my hotel around midnight on a weeknight.  Since I was still on California time, and I didn't eat the terrible food offered for sale on the plane, I was hungry.  Luckily, this place was across the street from my hotel, and open.    I got the fish and chips with a salad to start.  The fish was a whole fried haddock fillet.  I've never had it served like that before, and had no idea I'd get so much food.  It was good, and I ate as much as I could, but it was too much.    The servers were very friendly. and the place had a comfortable vibe."}
{"text":"Cold food, terrible service & ~$C27 for my troubles..."}
{"text":"I always enjoy my stay. Good people come here . You're always treated like royalty . Pulled pork is always great"}
{"text":"We were downtown and decided to drop by here for supper.  It's a beautiful heritage building (an old bank I believe).  The tables are a bit crowded and it is quite noisy.  My wife and I decided to share two appetizers (nachos and mini irish sausages).  My wife also wanted the soup of the day (lobster bisque soup).  She really enjoyed the soup.  The nachos were good with some chili on top.  The mini irish sausages were ok but they came with homemade fried chips which were delicious.  For desert we decided to have their homemade sticky toffee pudding.  It was incredible.  Other than the loud environement, we enjoyed our time there."}
{"text":"Didn't try their Deep Fried Mars bar this round. Rest assured, the Mars bar days are numbered!"}
{"text":"Dear Irish Embassy owners, today I had the displeasure of eating at your establishment, often cited as \"the better Irish pub\" in Montreal. On the lunch special was a Bolognese Mac n' Cheese, one Béchamel sauce away from a Pastitsio. But you had me at Mac n' Cheese, easily the greatest comfort food of all time.   But seriously guys, how could you possibly FUCK UP a Mac n' Cheese? It was so HORRID; Kraft Dinner was fine dining compared this heaping lump of oily greasy pasta which I was served by the lovely and friendly Sarah. 2/3 of the way and I stopped eating because there's was a puddle of oil in my dish. There was no Bolognese sauce, just minced meat on top of pasta... and really mozzarella in Mac n' Cheese? SIGH. And then I had to pay 24$ for the dish, cola and tip.   You guys have an awesome location and some cool staff, but your food is lost in the mail."}
{"text":"La bouffe était correcte sans plus, j'avais pris le rib steak avec sauce au poivre et frites. Le steak était cuit comme je voulais, les frites étaient trop salées à mon goût. Que j'ai moins aimé, c'était le service, c'était très long par moments malgré que la place n'était pas remplie à fond."}
{"text":"I went there to meet a group of friends, I took a pint of IPA and we shared a basket of fries with one of my friends. The IPA was ok wasn't the best one I've had and the basket of \"spicy\" fries was good but the spicy is yet to be found, I guess they meant seasoned. The place is nice, nothing special about it, just a nice pub without too much thought on the decor, the service was kind of bad, we had to find a waiter for 10 minutes before someone could take our order, and at some point I got so tired of waiting that got up and poured myself two glass of water at the counter, the waitress wasn't even chock she continue her conversation with her friend. So I will not recommend this pub for a nice 5 à 7."}
{"text":"My favorite bar in Montreal. Very good atmosphere. Great place to go with a group of friends."}
{"text":"Went for a late night bite.  For some reason,  I slotted this place above the numerous other pubs which populate the downtown core.  Maybe it's the bouncer or maybe its the fact that the place is housed in old architecture.   It was quite busy. There was the typical table of drunk meatheads in ties, the plenty of fish eating fish and chips couple beside me and a few dudes at the bar who would need a crowbar to move.    Our waiter was right from Ireland so the accent added a little authenticity.   It offers and good mix of domestic and imported beer but lacks a good selection of craft brews.   On a good note, the food arrived almost immediately. On a not so good note, the wings looking like they were plucked from vertically challenged chickens although the sauce was decent.  The dill sauce instead of blue cheese was disappointing.  I liked the thought of old cheddar the on Irish nachos but shamefully half of it was stuck to the paper. Disappointing.   Gets a three because it's a fun environment but the food is inferior to other pubs in the area."}
{"text":"What an awesome lrish pub right in downtown Toronto. It was walking distance to my hotel. We did not get to eat here but the drinks were great! They had live music which always makes it feel authentic. They have cool pictures of Ireland all over and very traditional Irish decor. Even the waitresses had Irish accents. I really appreciate the real authentic Irish pubs as they are hard to find. We had a great time here and I cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Na Bishop Street, centro de Montreal, tem vários restaurantes do estilo irlandês e inglês. Boa opção para restaurantes e bares. Eu minha esposa, e cunhada chegamos umas 23h no Irish Embassy, mais uma dica do Untappd. É um \"bar and grill\" com dois terraços, um virado para Bishop Street e outro para a rua de trás, e com área interna ampla em madeira. Preferimos ficar dentro, olhando para os bicos de cerveja na pressão. A atendente nos deu \"boa noite\" com uma piada sobre estarmos falando outro idioma. Informei que eu e minha esposa iríamos de inglês e minha cunhada de francês. Incrível a capacidade de chavear entre as duas línguas da moça. A província do Quebec tem essa grande vantagem: eles estão acostumados a falar francês e inglês o tempo todo.  Gostei muito do lugar! Vale a ida! http://www.retrogosto.com/2014/09/irish-embassy-irlanda-e-no-centro-de.html"}
{"text":"Was here for lunch and had the chicken curry - flavour was OK but not great.  My friend had the grilled cheese with a small salad.  Portions are medium to large which is ample for lunch.  Does not seem as busy as it used to be."}
{"text":"I've been to the Irish Embassy a half dozen times and I've yet to eat any food there. I go because it's a beautiful building to be inside and the brew is bountiful and cold.  Nice high ceilings and comfortable booths and tables make up the main sitting area of the Irish Embassy. There isn't a lot of separation in here so you'll be able to see everyone else who's visiting meaning it's not really the place to go if you'd like a private dinner conversation.  I've gone during the afternoon and late evening and it's always seemed like it's full of people who just got off work - the kind of work that requires you to wear a tie. Because of that it does sometimes have a slight frat boy reunion feel to it but not in an immature way.  The selection of beer is outstanding but I always stick to the native Irish ales - I feel like I'm cheating on the shamrock if I have anything not from the emerald isle while here."}
{"text":"Was last in around at 4pm on a Wednesday afternoon to meet friends from the UK going to a jays game, and figured we'd take them for a Guiness before walking over. Beer and drinks are great, but service was slow. Would have ordered another 1-2 pints if I could have while my glass was empty. Also ordered food, but it was pretty disappointing. The cottage pie was essentially microwaved mash and meat from pita pit. Have frequented this spot many times while in town, and to me there has clearly been new management. New staff, or not enough staff, resulting in a LONG time for service, and the food quality seems to have declined. Given the options in the area, I'd suggest heading west..."}
{"text":"Your classic Irish pub done in the traditional style. However upscaled additional launch to handle the blue suit crew! It looks like it's going to get a major renovation so look for even better decor. Menu and quality are classic Irish pub style, warm and friendly."}
{"text":"Best Fish & Chips I've ever had.  Batter crispy and fish was large full inside.  Batter didn't overwhelm the flavor of the fish. Came out hot even with a full house. Staff friendly and helpful"}
{"text":"The food and service is good. So are the prices, very reasonable! It gets crowded from the people working around the area. Cheers !"}
{"text":"I always make sure to pay a visit when in Toronto.  I have enjoyed all of the food I've had here, and they have a decent beer selection.  The prices seem a bit steep but, everything in Toronto seems expensive to me so, maybe that's just normal.  People watching is good and they have American Football on the TV's during season"}
{"text":"Great fish N Chip...Solid one! IT's a pub with waiting service, went there with the office for a 5-7 . Great atmosphere. I dig the Patio. Cute waitresses. Full bar and great variety. Not too expensive. moosehead was 5$ a pint : good deal for a decent beer.  Très bon Fish N Chip. Vraiment solide même. J'suis allé la avec la gang du bureau pour un 5 @7. Bonne atmosphère, pas trop chère et bon deal sur la Moosehead a 5$ la pinte qui est quand meme décente"}
{"text":"Irish Embassy is good if you're looking for a somewhat irish bar.... The music doesn't suggest it, and the beer selection does to a degree. The food is good and the beers are tasty but the ambiance is a little odd since this is an old bank.  Bartender's have always been good which is a huge plus for me and crowd is friendly so i can't complain.  I make this a go to place when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Incredible how the waitress totally  ignored us after she brought our food. Had fish and chips Which were good. We wanted dessert but she never came back. If you were a man you were in luck.  Too bad as we were planning on ordering Irish coffees and desserts but we were lucky to get our check."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Fish and chips mediocre at best (batter too thick and oil tasted old with off flavors); subpar fries. Bar and building have character, but not worth it. Service was average. With all of the pub options in the city, try someplace else."}
{"text":"What I like most about Irish Embassy is the patio out back.  It's a great place to grab drinks on a summer evening.  Foodwise it's fairly good depending on what you get.  I really like their fries which are seasoned well with salt and pepper.  They also have good burgers however I find the pulled pork a little dry.  The Irish lamb stew is also worth trying.  When it comes to alcohol they have a good selection of beers on tap and happy hour specials which is always a plus.   For tequila shots they use a tequila that isn't too harsh at all."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch one day. Had the chicken pot pie. Pretty good food, great atmosphere. A cool place to hang during the nights or after a sports event."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. Its not a typical pub feel but its unique.  The staff is really friendly. And the food is awesome.  If you go, you NEED to get the prime rib sandwich. I still dream about it.  I would have gone more if it was closer to home. But still its a great place to check out if you're downtown."}
{"text":"Nice Irish Gastropug in Downtown.  Their Irish poutine is really good, it must be the mayo!"}
{"text":"Came here at 2pm in the afternoon. Nice spot. Friendly staff and many tvs to watch whatever sport you want. The staff was nice enough to put football on when we requested.   Also, i thought this was a little strange but i didnt mind it all... There was a painting class going on in the back of the pub.  As for food, I ordered the soup of the day. It was $5 spicy noodle soup. I thought it was really really good. My friends ordered pulled pork poutine but did not enjoy it as much."}
{"text":"This place is great to grab a drink with a friend and hang out a while. Location is easily accessible and interior is nice: dim, leather, dark wood. Plus they take resos.  Service isn't their strong suit. Takes a while to flag down a server and they aren't overly friendly.   Prices are a bit high, but I guess that's due to location.  Food isn't the best so it's my preference to just come here for drinks. We had the spinach dip which tasted like it was frozen and microwaved and was small and not worth the $14 price tag. The irish nachos were better but sadly came to us cold."}
{"text":"This a a decent Irish pub. Not too sure if it hits the authentic mark though. The beers are OK and the decor is plain. This place is great for groups because of the large space. But I mean, if you're in the area, why not go to PJ O'Briens? Enough said!"}
{"text":"With Fiddler's Green now closed, this leaves Irish Embassy Pub and McKibbon's left on Bishop. Be warned this place is packed solid whenever there is a hockey game (and those are the days I never go to these types of joints) but otherwise, I've stopped here many times for lunch or dinner and while it's not spectacular 5-star cuisine, the sangria in the summer esp. out on the back terrace, the maple glazed salmon and the burgers have never really disappointed. Also, it is not obnoxiously loud so if you need to meet a friend or colleague, you can manage to have a decent conversation without yelling over the noise."}
{"text":"Irish pub you say? Well it was a far cry from Irish....  I had some difficulty ordering from the menu and it was not because the selection was so amazing that I could not figure out what to order. I really don't like giving a low rating to any place but this was one that I could not give any higher rating to.  Where do I start??? The interior is kinda pub(ish) I understand the building was previously a bank at some point to it had high vaulted ceilings and the bar OK the bar was pub(ish) looking. So half a point for the interior. The bathrooms were very clean and smelled very nice, half a point. Our waitress was very cheery and attentive, one full point.  I ordered curry chicken(very Irish) because I really didn't see anything on the menu that I wanted. I must say.. it was the worst curry chicken I have ever had! Maybe because Ireland is not really known for curry? I have had some great curry dishes in pubs though.  One of my friends had the haddock and chips... He stated it was meh.   Another of my friends at the table ordered the cottage pie... meh...  The only person at the table that kinda enjoyed their meal ordered Caesar salad!   We paid $125.00(that included two glasses of wine and two beers) tip was separate, four people in the group. I feel that is reasonable if the food is at least decent but this was a huge fail.   I can not recommend this place. I was quite disappointed."}
{"text":"The secret to this pub is the food. Sure, it's a typical packed Crescent street bar on weeknights - making dinnertime ambiance a bit of a challenge, but go for lunch - even a late one - and take a look at the little sheet tucked into the menu. Order something other than a burger and you may be quite delightfully surprised at the quality of what you get.  For example: On my last visit that little sheet had Fried Chicken and Waffles! I have never seen it anywhere other than Los Angeles and the South, so to see it here in a Montreal pub intrigued me. I ordered and it was right on. Delicious fried chicken with buttermilk waffles and a stunning, home made cayenne maple syrup packed with layers of complexity that makes my mouth water just thinking about it.  Now, chicken and waffles may not be your thing but on this occasion something happened that sold me on the place:  I was seated at the bar and a \"new\" bartender showed up. He sort of washed a dish and looked a little lost - but kept trying to gauge me. I struck up a conversation with him (to his relief I think) and he asked what I thought of the dish.   I told him how much I liked it and that I had other things there in the past - impressed that the menu varied with neat new local items to try and that they were always tasty!  \"Who is the chef?\" I said.  \"uh, me..\"   I shook his hand and told him how much I loved coming there. But man, an honest to goodness real chef that cares enough to stealth out a reaction to new dish - that impressed the hell out of me. This guy cares and I hope he keeps doing what he's doing!"}
{"text":"I usually come here with coworkers during the lunch hour.  They offer some really terrific food with a really terrific atmosphere.  It kind of feels like the sitcom Cheers.  Their beer selection is decent, and waitresses are pretty good.  Not to pricey either."}
{"text":"Don't order any appetizers from this place! The executive chef decided to be fancy and change the menu. We sent every appetizer our table ordered back to the waitress and she said it happens a lot. 2 of the items tasted like cat food (how I imagine it would taste) and the other two were just bad. We were all drunk and hungry and not at all picky yet we still couldn't stomach them.   Don't know about the entrees, but if the appetizers are any indication just don't order food from here period! The vibe is OK, typical pub, noisy, full of guys etc. I'd rather go to Imperial Pub down the street for some overpriced gin and tonics."}
{"text":"When hungry attacks and you need a late night snack, Irish Embassy Pub is not a bad choice in the area.  All my Yelp Friend wanted was some meat before he would faint, the Late Night Menu does have a Grilled Ontario 8oz Sirloin Burger ($17). A little more than he expected to pay but in the area at night, you have to do what you have to do!  How's the burger? I guess it was good as he did not even offer to give me a bite after I took the photos. He ate that in 5 minute.....  Beers Selection has the usual big name Imported: Guinness, Harp, Smithwicks And for local: Steam Whistler and Hogtown. And surprisingly GooseIsland Hanker Ale always available on Tap.  Whiskeys and Single Malt Scotch Selection is way better than beers... So I would make a note to have one of those next time when I visit.  Service is efficient and the waitress dropped by a few time to check on us making sure we were happy and asked if we needed a refill.  Close to King Subway Station, perfect for a night cap before heading home!"}
{"text":"I invariably end up here whenever I'm in Montreal, and it's alright. Very similar to several Irish pubs in Boston. Good food, good beer selection. A bit pricey, but it's downtown Montreal; you can't really do much cheaper in this area.   The outdoor spaces are what make this place better than it has any right to be. The back terrace is quite large and there is also a deck in front. Very nice on a summer evening."}
{"text":"Hey, it's a pub and an Irish one at that. Even our server's accent made us feel displaced outside of Canada for a moment. The lamb burger lunch special was good, the fries were good, and the best part is the hand written beer list. Makes me believe it is something that changes often which would be great!  Also, if you are looking for a quiet place to talk try to get a table in the room away from the bar."}
{"text":"Had heard about this place being really busy, however it wasn't as bad as I thought.  We made a reservation for our table, and it seemed it was full but not rammed.  Drinks were a tad expensive, but what can you do?  You're in the financial district and you can't escape that.   Beautiful interior.  Also, the Guinness (I like dark beers) was exactly as in the UK.  Not too carbonated!  Fantastic!    We only ordered appies, but they were pretty good.  Tandoori chicken kebabs were surprisingly tender and in a papadum basket.  Fries were good and perfectly crisp, liked the curry combo.  Veggie spring rolls were good but nothing to write home about.  Irish sausages were kinda yukky though.    The only complaint I have is that there was a piece of broken glass stuck to my pint.  That was a bit sketch."}
{"text":"Over-priced, pretentious and unfriendly service and crowd. Won't be heading back here again."}
{"text":"First off, great name for a pub.  Fitting for the high-ceilinged environment as well. Beyond that, nothing extremely special happening here. Kudos to the staff for finding room for a big group on a Friday night.  Menus were placed on the table, but nothing beyond a drink order was taken. Probably just before 11:00 or so, the server started taking away the menus without saying anything. Some at the table had to ask to place a food order, which the server reluctantly took. Food was just okay in the end. Should have maybe saved the money and stopped by Burger's Priest later instead. But y'know, it's what you would expect for an \"Irish\" pub."}
{"text":"We stopped in here before a hockey game. The vibe can be described as an authentic Irish pub. The waitstaff was very friendly and the bartender was perfectly Irish.  This is the kind of place where you can enjoy some Guinness as well as some shots of Jameson with some new-found friends.  When I spotted the Bangers and Mash on the menu, I was looking forward to see how they made this Irish staple food. It was what I had hoped for, a nice portion of sausage with some creamy mashed potatoes. I was not disappointed. I don't believe you will be either. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Your typical Irish pub. I told ya, Montreal is filled with these places! Came in on Sunday afternoon to quench our thirst after a few hours of shopping. The bar tender was friendly, and our drinks never ran dry.   If you're looking for a good brew and a chill place to have it, you won't be dissappointed. That's really all I can say!"}
{"text":"This was a cool place to hang out with friends on a Friday night. We hadn't made reservations but found a table for 6 easily at 6pm. We ordered lots of beer (guinness of course!) and each ordered mains. I had the pasta of the day, which had chicken and random veggies. It was alright, nothing memorable. The pasta was way on the al dente side. There was a lamb shepherd's pie, which was described as being very lamb-y! That should be a good thing unless you hate lamb. The complimentary bread was plain, tided us over til our food came out.    I wouldn't come here for the food, but service was friendly and we sat there all night. Also, coming from Victoria, where there are Irish and English pubs galore, I think what this place felt very uncozy compared to the other ones I've been in. Could be a slow night or maybe they could start up live entertainment :D Seemed to work well in Victoria."}
