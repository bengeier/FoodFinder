I saw they had an all you could eat weekday for lunch and juggled appointments so that i may try it... and OMFG for $10.00 what a deal! i got a nice big Ceser Salad with crisp lettuce   and flavorful  dressing.. but the pizza.. that was a time to try them out they brought out 5 different pizzas and they were all soo good, they also had some soup and pasta... ... again for $10.00 is was sooooo well worth it for such good food,
 I will be going back often."}
{"text":"What a place.  Went there as a group of 7. Very good service, patient staff.
The appetizers and drinks took some time to come to the table, but were delicious when they came.  Because this was late the pizza we ordered came right after we finished the apps.
We ordered 4 small (gluten free pizzas) for the seven of us.  Just enough! The flavours were all unique and not typical to your standard pizza joint.
The server was quick to spot her mistakes and even more swift to ensure it was corrected.  The vibe and atmosphere was unique and rustic.
Desert was phenomenal. Original and cooked to perfection. Wood fired really hit the spot for the main and dessert. Must go.

We went on a Sunday, so there was no wait, and the booths weren't filled. I would assume busy days would be Friday and Saturday evenings.

However at $3 per small pizza extra for gluten free seems pricey."}
{"text":"We all get in the family truckster and head off to The Rock in royal oak. Me, the wife and our three boys get there at 4:50 pm. There were a few people ahead of us in line, Kelly our hostess told us it would be a few minutes as they were awaiting a server who was starting at  5pm. We waited until 5 and were seated at a nice clean booth by the window. 
   Our server was a  polite young lady named Lexi. We ordered our drinks and appetizers. Our one son is lactose intolerant so no cheese was ordered on his pasta dish off the kids menu. The family sized Caesar salad came in a huge red mixing bowl with tongs that was actually enough to feed the whole family!  We ordered  two pizzas the 9\" Meaty Beaty  and the 9\" Bohemian. You can choose between two  types of sauces on your pizza. Mine came with the traditional red pasta sauce and the Bohemian came with a white creamy style sauce.Both sauces were excellent.
    The boys went overboard and were allowed to order two items each off the kids menu... We must have looked like gluttons as two cheeseburgers and fries, two kids meat sauce pastas,1 kids cheese pizza, 1 kids nuggets and fries all came out with two pops and soda float. We had to make room on the table for the boys feast :) 

The only glitch for the evening occurred when the 2 kids pastas had to be sent back as they had cheese on them. No biggie... A few minutes later 2 new cheese free dishes arrived.

The  kids menu was a great value at $3.99 ea., and the 9\" pizzas were $12.99 and $10.99. Overall the pizzas were delicious and  we ended up taking home 4 boxes of leftovers.  Our total for five people was $87.20 we had a ten dollar coupon from their take out menu so we ended with a $77.20 tab, not bad for a night out with the family.

We will definitely be back to The Rock.

P.S.    You should also try out the beer sampler for 6 smaller  glasses of  beer for $7.99 Yummy."}
{"text":"This meal was so comically bad I kept expecting a hidden camera crew to pop out and announce I'd been punked.

As we are seated our server informs us that we can order from the menu or partake in the $9.99 lunch buffet, which features \"soup, pasta and pizza\" and comes with a starter salad.  When I ask if the buffet has anything vegetarian our server informs me that \"usually they try to have a vegetarian pizza out there\".  I inquire about the soup, to which she replies, \"Another table asked about that too!  I'll go find out!\"  Apparently if you'd like your questions answered here you'd better hope another table has the same question!

As luck would have it the soup and pasta dishes both included meat, so I ordered a 9\" pizza off the menu and my friend said she'd have the buffet.  

And then we sat.

After FORTY-FIVE minutes our server came back, apologized for the wait and said my pizza would be out shortly.  As we approached the one-hour mark a manager came out and said that my pizza was on the way; apparently all the toppings had fallen off when they tried to cut it, so they had to re-make it?  Meanwhile, my lovely friend showed excellent restraint, eating only her starter salad (bagged shredded iceberg lettuce with two cherry tomatoes and two green olives) and not beginning her buffet dining.

When my pizza finally arrived my friend did go to the buffet, which was totally picked over and hardly had anything left.  (Aside: Always be suspicious of poorly-lit buffets!)  She had two small slices of pizza and a little bit of pasta.  Amazingly, when she went up for seconds THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT.  THERE WAS NO PIZZA!

Shortly after the staff brought out one more pizza.  My friend quickly grabbed a slice, and by the time she was halfway through eating it they were once again out of food, with a line of about ten people waiting for pizza- any pizza- to appear at the buffet.

The weirdest thing about the long waits and picked-over buffet is that the restaurant wasn't even busy.  What on earth happens when this place is slammed?

When our server cleared our plates she asked how our meal had been.  We informed her it had been \"disappointing\".  When she brought the bill- no discounts, no coupons for future visits, nada- she did have the courtesy to say, \"Sorry for the disappointment.\"  

Thanks.

I can see why this place serves three-ounce cocktails in buckets- you'll need to be pretty darn drunk to tolerate the apathetic, inefficient service here."}
{"text":"I liked this place, good food and service and not expensive. Definitely going again :)"}
{"text":"While I was visiting my friend in the far NW he suggested we go over to this pizza place near his new home that he claimed had \"amazing pizza\". 

We walked in and I got a Boston Pizza vibe right away due to how the atmosphere, set up and décor looked. We went over to the lounge, sat down in a booth and perused the menu.
I ordered their suicide blonde microbrew, it was actually quite light and tasty but I have to say that I wasn't very impressed that they didn't have much more selection in beer.

We settled with two 9\" pizzas...first one was Harvest Moon which was supposed to come with fresh roma tomatoes, crushed garlic spread, capers, prosciutto, mozzarella cheese topped with fresh basil leaves. However It didn't have capers or fresh basil when it arrived and was just ok. I found the garlic spread to be very greasy and the pizza was just kind of boring. (Even with the forgotten basil leaves that we added on ourselves afterwards)

The second pizza we ordered was Bohemian Rhapsody. It had chicken, roasted peppers, cream sauce, mozzarella cheese and \"Cajun spices\". It didn't taste like anything special and I think the spices were omitted because it was very bland.

I have to say the best part of my experience here was our server. She was cute and attentive and on another high note the bill was quite cheap, under $40 with 18% tip (included was the two 9\" pizzas and three draft pints)

Overall though I feel like I wasted my precious calories and had better pizza out of a box."}
{"text":"We have been here quite a few times and it hasn't disappointed. Whether adults only night or when we have a family night out. We always order some appetizers (rock chips and the dip) as well as a couple pizzas to share- which we never finish and get to take home :o)

The service has always been great and we love the pizza. Always fresh, hot and good non-greasy pizza. We love the kids meals and we have always been happy with everything, every time we have gone to The Rock. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Ya,... sadly no.
We initially were in the Royal Oak area for the Vietnamese restaurant next door but sadly, they are closed on Tues so we thought we would try this place out even though we were not in a pizza mood.
We walked in and went to the lounge initially - decided on the dining area. We had a whole booth section to ourselves which was one of the only pluses of the evening. We noted while walking the length of the restaurant how many tables needed clearing off and cleaning.
We had a newbie waiter who was very nice but very slow. We ordered a beer sampler ($6.95) and a glass of wine $8.50 for a 9 oz glass) as well as just 2 appies - garlic mozza bread ($6.99) and chicken strips in hot sauce (more vinegary than hot) ($9.99) which the menu boasts - they are an ``insane amount of chicken.` Wrong. 
The garlic bread was just a simple small pizza crust with mozza cheese on it. The cheese was decent but I did not detect ANY garlic whatsoever. I mean none. Disappointing. The chicken appy was hardly a single portion but with the bread and drinks we did not leave hungry. The food took a hell of a long time to come out and the place was not busy at all.
The rock music playing was OK, they tried hard with the decor - kind of an alley, backstreet feel which would leave a much better impression if the place was clean.  
If you want a place to have a pint and some pizza with some friends, go check it out but I would take a date elsewhere. Not a place to bring someone to impress regarding food nor service."}
{"text":"Not sure about this restaurant yet. Pretty good pizza but I was not really hungry. I ate one slice, bad news cut my craving for a Montreal style pizza. 
We went about 5pm so it was pretty empty. Our waitress was extremely nice. Food came quick. Pretty good just not 100 positive on how good. The waitress told us one of the Stampeders half owns this restaurant."}
{"text":"Our family went to this restaurant last night, and we left completely disappointed with no intentions to return.  After being seated immediately, it took at least 10-15 minutes for our server to arrive at our table.  The calamari appetizer was basically balls of deep fried batter and their signature \"rock chips\" were horribly over salted.  My son ordered the White Room, which is basically fettuccine alfredo, and it was over salted as well.  The side salad that came with it was a poor excuse for a salad - shredded iceberg lettuce with a single purple onion ring, 2 cherry tomatoes, an olive and 2 cucumber slices.  It seemed more like an afterthought than an actual menu item.  The pizzas were okay - it's hard to screw up a classic pepperoni and cheese, so they get points for that.  I had the Harvest Moon, which was okay but I wouldn't order it again.  Our kids ordered dessert, which looked much better on the menu than what arrived at our table.  The vanilla smoothie was basically cold milk with ice cream mixed in and chunks of ice.  We sent that back and had it taken off our bill.  

The décor is fun and funky, and the patio has the potential to be a great place to hang out in the summer.  I might go back if I just wanted to bask in the sunshine and have a drink, but nothing on the menu would tempt me to eat there again."}
{"text":"We've been here twice and unfortunately the cool decor and the creatively written menus are the highlight of the restaurant. 

They say they are famous for their pizza but frankly it's OK and not all that special.    I tried 3 pizzas - a cheese, a veggie and another on with a pesto sauce.  These ranged from bland to OK.   This is not a pizza I would seek out on my own but it's not something I'd turn down either.  

Their veggie burger made to order with mushrooms most closely reminds me of a high school cafeteria fare.   Edible but that's about it.   Fries were dry and not that great.  One thing to note with the veggie burgers,  you can substitute a veggie patty for any of their burgers - which is nice.  The mushroom burger is what I tried and it comes with full sized mushrooms that kept escaping - would have been better if they were sliced. 

Garden salad is a miss - it's mostly shredded lettuce from a bag with a few slivers of over chilled and flavorless veggies.  You can get a better side salad from a fast food place. 

The only thing that impressed me was a bun I had - it's a very doughy bun (like one that's not risen) but I quite like the taste.   I certainly hope that's what they were going for... haha.

on weekdays at lunch  11 - 1:30 they have a buffet for $10 which is still a value if you're hungry even when you're discussing moderately tasting food.    They had about 6 pizzas out that they kept rotating in different types, a couple pastas, a soup or two and they bring you a salad. 

The one thing I should note for vegetarians -   I was told \"oh they always have a vegetarian pizza, the soup and pastas are vegetarian\".   Well... there was veggie pizza but there was also bacon in the \"vegetarian\" pasta and I asked someone else about the soup base and it was made with chicken stock.   

No rush to try this place out again."}
{"text":"The food is great but the service sucks...which lowered my rating. He wood fired pizza has great flavour and is consistent however we waited 25 minutes just to get our drinks! Although the service is slow, our server was friendly and was doing the best she could under the circumstances. More staff definitely need to be hired!"}
{"text":"Worst of the worst. And by that I mean the management. Will not go there ever again after finding out how they treat current staff, and bar former staff from entering. Shameful."}
