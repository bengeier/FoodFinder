{"text":"Just tried this new resto for brunch and was very impressed all around.  They take reservations which is a plus especially for brunch. The restaurant is on the ground floor of a new hotel.  The decor is very attractive and warm with tables set up so that you have plenty of space.  The service was impressively friendly and attentive without being intrusive.
For brunch we tried the duck confit hash, the breakfast pizza and the frittata, all well prepared and very flavourful.  We will definitely return to try their dinner menu."}
{"text":"This review is for a brunch visit. I recall a dingy hotel occupying this area as even on a recent trip the area was strange mix of new high rise condos and some parts that would make you even afraid of your own shadow. I guess progress has moved in and a new hotel occupies the old dingy hotel. The lobby and restaurant have a modern look yet they feel a bit overwhelming with low ceiling and lack of windows. Ah well moving on from the aesthetics we ordered the following
Toasted Sourdough with ricotta, honey, pistachio and pears. Nothing special IMO. OK for a filler I suppose.
Duck Hash. This came with poached eggs as well.  A hearty option for brunch I suppose. However I didn't like the taste profile. Also surprising was the addition of potatoes even though it clearly specified sweet potatoes. Its not the same you say potatoes I say batatas as both are quite different in taste.
I tried the ricotta pancakes as well, again not what I expected as another place that is known for ricotta pancakes incorporates them in their batter. Not the case here just a dollop with a hint of lemon for ricotta. Serviceable but not worth a detour.
The service is all over the place as well as after getting the menus we had to wait a bit to get our order in and follow up lacked as well. The place wasn't busy so if you are in a bind for brunch give this a look. Otherwise I think even a skip for brunch."}
{"text":"Constantine is one of Toronto's newest and trendiest restaurants with a focus on Mediterranean food. The restaurant itself is beautiful and I will definitely be back to try their brunch! I tried a few of their dishes, but what really stood out for me was the gnocchi (tomato, eggplant, whipped ricotta). The tomato sauce was super fresh and the gnocchi was PILLOWLY soft and airy."}
{"text":"Beautiful decor and atmosphere overall. Service was good however food was just average. The pizza was delicious, but the shakshuka and duck hash was just ok in my opinion. Would definitely give it another try as their pastas look good. The flat iron steak was originally in their brunch menu but they took it off which was disappointing."}
{"text":"Came here with such a high hope but was quite disappointed. 

First the food. We had liver pate crostini, crudo of the day, kale salad, and a burrata cheese as appetizer. The kale salad was missing balance. It has too many citrus flavour in it and missed nutty/earth flavour (could have been better with some pecans or almonds). The crostini is not proportional to the liver pate - just too much pate and a bit too rich. It felt like a whole meal after eating it. After apps, we had a fennel salad, lamb rib and a braised beef cavatelli. While the other two were good, the lamb rib was a total disaster. It was so dry, over cooked and over spiced. You can't taste a single bit of the fattiness of lamb nor its \"lamb\" flavour.   

Other than the food, the service was incredibly slow. This is not our servers fault - more of a combination of understaff and a bad floor design. We came here on a Thursday night and the place got busy after 8pm. It looks like it's seriously understaffed with the amount of seating it has. Also because the huge open concept kitchen is located right in the middle and the restaurant has a few rooms/section/booths behind high chairs, it's seriously blocking servers views as they walk by. We came at 6:30 and we didn't finish until 9:30. I would say we spent more than 30min waiting to get a check and the POS machine. 

Yelp said this place is Mediterranean but in fact it's more of a Middle Eastern and Italian fusion. You will see once you see the pasta and pizza section on the menu. Not sure about the pizza here, but as of the middle eastern part, compared to the similar themed Bar Sybanne which I just went a few days ago before Constantine's, the latter really needs to do some work!"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant after the first visit! Cannot keep away from it and so far tried a few of their creative menu items. A mediterranean twist enhances it! The beautiful art deco, casual several seating sections, open kitchen and wooden oven,  presentation and quality of dishes and the friendly staff all combined, contribute to a satisfying dining experience. Their dessert menu of edible pleasures is not to be missed! I need a membership there!"}
{"text":"I made a reservation a few weeks ago when I saw this restaurant featured in Toronto Life.  I remember how hard it was to try La Palma (same chef) last summer so I rushed to make a reservation and was not let down.

The restaurant is very spacious and modern.  It is divided into three unique spaces - a bar area that is supposed to be somewhat more lively, the lounge and the dining room.  The space we were seated had a fire place and was quite cozy.  Our waitress was very friendly and spent time walking us through the menu.  She mentioned that before the restaurant opened the staff got to try all the dishes so she was able to provide recommendations based on our desired palette.  She also was able to accommodate small changes to the items we wanted to try to avoid dairy.  The menu features a combination of Middle Eastern and Italian food (two of my favourites)!  Similar to La Palma, the menu has an entire section devoted to vegetable sides.  

We settled on the cauliflower to start, which quite frankly was a let down.  The pepper sauce was great but I was expected the cauliflower to be hot and it was cold (not even mildly heated).  The mezze plate was amazing and came with a long flat bread seasoned with za'tar and has three dips: labneh, eggplant and red pepper.  I was a bit annoyed that the waitress noted in advance that she would omit the feta atop one of the dips yet didn't offer substitute the labneh for extra of one of the other dips (we also didn't notice or ask so I guess our fault a bit too but it literally went untouched since we don't eat dairy).

For mains, we shared the eggplant gnocchi (without ricotta) and the eggplant pizza (without cheese).  I appreciated that the pizza had enough toppings that it was still very satisfying and enjoyable without the cheese.  It was topped with eggplant, raisins and pine nuts.  The breading was similar to the flatbread. 

I appreciated the pace at which the food came out - each appetizer on its own and then the pizza and gnocchi together.  The dessert menu left much to be desired so we skipped it.  Overall, great menu and I would definitely come back.  I felt the prices were reasonable for the level of service and the quality of the food."}
{"text":"This place may be my new favourite place for pasta in the city.

I ordered the pappardelle, split the roasted sweet potatoes and tried a bite of the cavatelli. I loved every bite and intend to go back again - maybe to try the other dishes on offer, but really to devour another plate of that rich, flavourful pappardelle.

(Also, A+ service and decor.)"}
{"text":"Surprising location for the quality of food. The coffee bar is also amazing and serves some of the best pastries"}
{"text":"Interesting fusion cuisine with Italian and Middle Eastern dishes. We were a group of 4 and were too lazy to pick our own food (the menu is very extensive) so we went with the $65 family style sharing menu. The best dish was the pear and walnut pizza. I also really liked the grilled halloumi on panella. The gnocchi was good. Lamb ribs were very unique - I've never had lamb like that before (served with a molasses sauce). The nougat dessert is so beautiful and unique. While I normally gravitate towards decadent chocolate desserts, this was really special and I loved it. 

Good, but probably wouldn't order again: mezze plates with flatbread, swiss chard fritters, spiced carrots. 

I would go back to this restaurant. I'd like to try their other dishes not included in the family style menu, such as the rabbit papperdelle and wagyu. 

Other non-food remarks: this restaurant is surprisingly big and busy, decor is beautiful. The service was very good. The cocktails are interesting but pricey ($17 ish). The whole meal with the family style for 4 people, 1 bottle of wine, and 4 cocktails came to about $460."}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've had all year (so far). Where to begin...I'd been curious about this new spot for a little while - I actually live down the street and it felt like the best western became this black boutique hotel the andore house overnight - and every time I walked by I wondered what Constantine was all about. Imagine my surprised when I realized it was the project by the chef of two of my favourite spots in the city (la Palma, and campagnolo). So - I had dinner there last night (finally). The decor is beautiful - light - airy - clean - and just all around lovely. It's unexpected given that the hotel has such a dark colour palette but it really is beautiful. Wine selection is good - cocktails are delicious! Even had the virgin almond cobbler and it was divine. On to food - we had the fennel and cara cara salad - the virtues fruit cut through the bitterness of the grilled fennel really well. Next was the halumi Panella - probably my favourite thing of the night - we ordered it twice more before leaving. Very unique - so delicious! For pasta we shared the cavatelli - and it's as good as all the other reviews say it is. We split the cod as our main - and that might be one of the best cod dishes I've ever had. For dessert we had a deconstructed Arab influence mill fieulle - which I personally loved. The cheese they use has a sour taste (almost like yogurt). I LOVED it - but if you prefer more traditional sweets go for the nougat or the chocolate dessert. Really really impressed and will definitely be back ASAP."}
{"text":"Came here for Mother's Day dinner after reading all the great reviews. We were a party of 4.

The space is beautiful, and they have a great cocktail menu.

We were a bit surprised to learn they've taken the papardelle off the menu already, because we had seen excellent reviews of that dish and wanted to try it. They had also already run out of lamb ribs for the day even though it was only 6pm. It seems they might have a few things to work out with their menu. 

We shared the Mezze Plate, which was tasty, and the Chicken Liver Crostini and Grilled Halloumi on Panella which were quite good. We also shared the Cacio e Pepe pizza, which we were not impressed with - it was basically the same piece of flatbread that came with the mezze plate made into a pizza. 

For mains, we had the lamb burger, spaghetti, spiced carrots, and short ribs - unfortunately no one at our table was blown away with their main dish. Lamb burger was a bit dry in my opinion.  

Service was very friendly, but slightly slow and food/cocktails did take a little while to come out - to the point where various members of our party inquired about their drinks. 

We would come back again for cocktails in this beautiful space - and maybe give it a while for dinner until their menu is sorted."}
{"text":"I ate here the other night and it was delicious. The Cornish hen was amazing. It's like a modern high end New York cuisine with arabic fusion. The gnocchi is amazing also. The flat bread is good. The waiters are very kind and patient and helped explained the menu. I came again for breakfast. I ordered eggs over easy, they came back over medium. They were also too salty. 
Overall it was a good experience. I'll skip breakfast next time and just come for dinner"}
{"text":"Beautiful space. My wife and I really enjoyed our lunch. Our favourite dish was the strachiatella crostini. We also enjoyed the kale and rutabaga salad, and the caci e pepe pizza. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Stunningly mediocre and massively disappointing. I don't know if we ordered the wrong things, but there were too many misses when my wife and I visited Constantine for dinner. We were all hyped up for a great meal as we sat at the chef's table and saw all these gorgeous dishes they were making. Sadly, it was a big letdown when we got our food:

APPETIZERS
- Mezze Plates with Flatbread (eggplant, garlic, sumac, labneh, cucumber, hazelnut, muhammara, walnuts, herbs): The \"spreads\" were standard fare, the flatbread was overly salty.
- Grilled Halloumi on Panella: The halloumi was a bit rubbery, and maybe I haven't had a lot of panella to know what it should taste like but this was much blander than I thought it should be (and not in a good complement-the-cheese type of way).
- Crudo of the Day: This turned out to be tuna. It was fresh and had a light taste to it, which was good. Though for the price, I was expecting a bit more (i.e., bigger serving, more differentiated taste).

MAINS
- Gnocchi alla Norma: The gnocchi had different consistencies (i.e., some were harder others softer), the tomato sauce was pedestrian, and I was hoping the eggplant and whipped ricotta would be more imaginatively integrated into the dish versus just being plopped into it. 
- Wagyu Picanah: They said the beef would be on the rare side, and it was cooked to the right temperature, though it was a bit tough - we've had much better wagyu elsewhere. The star of the dish was the tabouleh (good mix, loved the different textures).

DESSERTS (this was the standout part of the meal for us)
- Labneh Mille-Feuilles: Really soft and tender yogurt and coffee mousse, and the caramelized white chocolate and figs were a nice complement (both from a taste and texture perspective). 
- Chocolate dessert with kalamansi and lemonquat: Think this was the best dish for me from a \"taste + this-is-new\" perspective. The cake was moist and oozing with chocolate, and the kalamansi sauce and lemonquat really added a nice and citrusy counterbalance to the sweetness.

If it weren't for the desserts and the experience of sitting at the chef's table, I likely would have given Constantine a lower rating. For the price you pay, there are much better Mediterranean restaurants out there. Such a disappointment."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, very good wine list and impeccable service.  The attention to detail was what made the evening."}
{"text":"The chef from La Palmas and Campagnolo, Craig Harding, brings Toronto another home run menu. Cuisine is Arabic/Italian fusion, the intersection of pan Middle-Eastern and Mediterranean Italian. Inspired by a food trip to Istanbul and Israel, Craig's bringing forward Arabic flavours first, with cooking techniques and bases from Italy. For example, his grilled short rib in a tomato zatar, or his artichoke and red pepper branzino roses on bulgur. What I really appreciate about his cooking is he seems to understand the Arabic cuisine, almost as if he's been cooking with those flavours his entire life. It's the first successful attempt at elevating Arabic cuisine I've seen in Toronto.  

Service wise, a little younger, and gives the place a slightly cooler and more relaxed ambiance. Space wise, lots of gold, blacks, and whites, with the kitchen right in the centre. The space thus feels airy, with pockets of individual character. A smart move, because it makes coming back to the restaurant a new experience each time you're sat in a different style. 

A personal new favourite of mine, and a must visit."}
{"text":"The chef from Campagnolo has done it again! I came here on a Wednesday and it was packed - no doubt. Constantine serves Italian/Arabic and to my surprise, I really enjoyed all their dishes! 

I had their Tuna Credo, Papardelle, Lamb Ribs and Sweet Potato with Figs. 

The tuna credo was exquisite. Mind you, you're not paying for portions here - everything is delicious and for sharing. The edible flowers and hints of pickled vegetables were perfect with the tuna.

The papardelle was served with braised rabbit and green olives in a creamy red sauce. Probably one of my favourites of the night.

My favourite was the lamb ribs. They're served with a yogurt sauce on the side but the ribs were marinated perfectly and cooked so well that I didn't even need the sauce. So good.

As a \"vegetable side\", we got the sweet potato and figs salad. It's standard but I love that they grill the figs before putting them into the dish. Gives a little charred/smoky flavour to them"}
{"text":"Wow. The food here is absolutely fantastic. Me and my husband stopped in here for brunch today (Sunday). We thought the prices looked pretty reasonable and we wanted to check out the new restaurant. 

The restaurant itself is gorgeous. There's a nice, semi-covered patio, a bar area and the restaurant. The centrepiece of the restaurant is the open kitchen, where you can watch the kitchen work it's magic. It is nice, bright and open for the day time, but I can see how the restaurant could also be perfect for a romantic date night. 

Moving on to the food. The food is 5-star, in my opinion. We ordered the breakfast pizza, the duck confit hash and the sourdough with ricotta. Everything was delicious, but the breakfast pizza was the showstopper. It has egg, merguez and bacon, and was rich, gooey and delicious. No complaints about the duck confit either. We will for sure be coming back to try more dishes. 

That being said, I'm giving a four star review because the service is brutally slow. I'm talking snails pace slow. Our server was really inefficient and our food took forever. Especially for brunch, I think people expect a bit of a faster pace. Our waters were filled, but our plates sat empty for awhile and we waited a long time to pay our bill. Hopefully management nabs the poor service in the bud, because the food is fantastic."}
{"text":"Great dishes and decor. Ambiance. Good service.
Apps, mains, deserts deconstruction all solid. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I was very much looking forward to this meal after having enjoyed Campagnolo given it is the same chef behind both. It was a failed attempt at avant garde. 

The decor is beautiful and I was quite impressed with how tasteful the vibe was. Much to my chagrin however, the food does not live up to the same standard. 

I went for brunch and was looking forward to some classic cacio e pepe; to my surprise it came out as a pizza with no mention of such on the menu. The item above it was listed as a pizza and this one clearly was not - the server expected me to have a moment of clairvoyance when I brought this to her attention. The dish was over salted, underwhelming and I walked away hungry after swallowing my meal. 

Also disappointing that this clear misrepresentation by the restaurant was at my own expense. No apology for the manager despite the restaurant being over half empty."}
{"text":"Excellent spot. Now my go to restaurant. Decor is soft and beautiful and you can hear a conversation here   What a revelation. 

Menu is runique. Had breakfast here one day and brunch the next week. All meals were delicious although I found the chef heavy handed on the salt. 

If you're like me and don't like heavy salt let your server know when you order"}
{"text":"For a restaurant that is only 3 weeks old, there must be buzz already, as it was full.  But for good reason.   This beautifully designed place was fantastic.  The food was delicious and the service was both first class and friendly.  We started with a burrata which was nestled atop an interesting and delicious mixture of peas and pesto.  We both had the whole grilled fish with sides (extra) of delicious eggplant. and another with sweet potato, figs and goat cheese.  Finally for dessert we shared a nougat that had a pistachio cloud like topping and honey. omg!  I will definitely go back unless they get so popular that reservations will be impossible."}
