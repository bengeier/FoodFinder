{"text":"Pour la pâtisserie, je trouve que qualité/prix est le meilleur. On peut aller ailleur pour moins cher, mais moins bon aussi."}
{"text":"High end pastry shop and café that offers very good quality pastries and spectacular looking cakes.    They serve some tasty sandwiches, quiches,  pizzas and salads for lunch.  I specially like their hot chocolate concoted with melted pieces of chocolate that they make on premise.  Prices are not cheap but they have a nice dinning area.  A good place for breakfast also if you like the pasty/coffee combo."}
{"text":"j ai .été pour la veille de Noel et j e suis sortie tres décue . D abord les prix ont augmenté , la portion est réduite , la variété n y est plus et le gout est loin d etre savoureux . des croissants insipides , au gout sucré . non .le rapport qualité -prix n y est plus . Gascogne vit sur ses lauriers . désormaiis je me fournirais chez La premiere moisson .on y a pour son argent"}
{"text":"Extremely snooty place.  they ALL refuse to speak English!  Give me a break!  The pastry and bread is good, if you can communicate to them without having to point at everything. Expensive with an attitude. I now go elsewhere when spending 45.00 on a cake."}
{"text":"A really cute place that is really quite large!    There is a little section for truffles and chocolates, a little section for speciality baked goods and cakes, a little bread section, a little section for cheese, a little section for take home type foods - i.e., box of petite fours, macarons, pies, savoury type foods, and another little area with sandwiches/yogurt/ cafeteria type items.  It is a nice place to grab a little treat if you are in the area.  There is a really beautiful park close by called Bois Franc.  The shop is located right by a large complex of relatively upper middle class town homes.  So I expect a lot of their business comes from the neighbourhood.  Prices are what you would expect - about $4-5 for a little tart.    I tried the pear and almond tart and it was not bad ... buttery and not too sweet but it didn't knock my socks off.  Cute place :)"}
{"text":"I am so happy that there is a location close to my photo studio so I can pick up delicious treats for client meetings.  My favorite is the chocolate cake or the plate of mini pastries (not always displayed in the pasty case, but if you ask, they will usually have some in the back).  Pastries & baguettes are always fresh, service is prompt & polite and there is ample parking out front."}
{"text":"I never stayed long enough to devour my fruit cake,  I usually take it home and enjoy it with a warm coffee.  I only gave this location 4* because of its prices,  which are on the higher end.  5$ for a small fruit cake seems a bit expensive. Can't argue with taste though : delicious!"}
{"text":"Nice place to relax and chat with friends.  I go there quite often in the week-ends.  Their coffee is really good and they give free refills (Yay!).  They have a lot of yummy pastries, sandwiches and cakes.  Heard their hot chocolates are awesome too.   I'll have to try it next time, which is pretty soon."}
{"text":"Love all their fruity cakes. Really quality stuff. They're chocolate-y cakes are too rich for me. Check your cakes if you preordered to make sure you have the right one! They messed up our last order when we reserved two cakes. Their Sicilian bread is to die for. Their almonds chocolatines are a bit too rich and sweet for me. The abricotine is delicious!"}
{"text":"I had bad experiences a few years ago with this place. I believe that there was a problem with the fridge back then which made all my pastries smell and taste like burned electronics mixed. Worst thing I've ever had. Thinking about it makes me cringe. The workers should have fixed the issue right away or at least not sell those pastries. Aside from that, everything else seems to be quite decent now. Their cured meat cuts are nicely salted and flavorful."}
{"text":"Very bad customer service , and  the ( white hair man) I think the menager he constantly refuses to speak in English with you , he thinks he is a big shot , he  hates children I was there last Sunday with my 3 years old and when my kid was crying he comes and gives us this mean look (like shut your kid up) and my kid dropped a piece of cake on the floor and again he passes by my table and looks at my kid an rolls his eyes, I guess God never rewarded him with children maybe that's why he hates kids.They think they are the best pastry shop in Montreal , well  20 years ago maybe but not anymore there customers age is 55 and up  new generation will  not go here because there is soooooo many pastry shops in Montreal much much better then them, ooo plus there employees never simile I think the owners are telling them not to in order to act like a big shot in front of customers .Croissants they serve is cold not crunchy absolutely nothing special , they are still in business because of the legacy they had 20 years ago plus because of older age clientele they have ."}
{"text":"Bunch of snoots! I don't know who the workers think they are but I don't think you're getting paid that much to act like you all own the place. Smile once in a while it will do you good. Your pastries are not that good. And your coffees...well lets say better spend your money elsewhere. Its awful."}
