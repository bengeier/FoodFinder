{"text":"Un petit-déjeuner du samedi matin quasi parfait! Une petite salade de roquette fraîche à souhait, des fruits dignes du marché Jean-talon, du VRAI bacon pas trop cuit qui ne baigne pas dans le gras et deux ufs frais tournés cuits à la perfection! Seul petit hic: les pommes de terre industrielles sans saveur et sans assaisonnement ainsi qu'un pain industriel également. Avec les belles boulangeries qu'il y a au marché, l'effort est plutôt minime pour offrir une belle tranche de pain miche (surtout que la boulangerie Au pain doré est juste à côté!)."}
{"text":"Crappy coffee with crappy attitudes from staff to match...don't waste your time or money here."}
{"text":"Very decent cafe facing onto the Marche Jean Talon, in my opinion the premier farmers market in Montreal.   We come here for breakfast. Coffee is excellent, nice menu with enough variation to be interesting without falling into the multi-pages trap.  I had a basic Canadian breakfast - eggs, proper bacon, beans [much better than expected], lots of fruit and roasted potatoes, and a light sausage paste that is smeared on toast. Less than $10 Canadian."}
{"text":"Dropped by for a nice breakfast before visiting the market and got a regular coffee and egg and ham croissant sandwich. It was nice that it came nice and toasty, like a panini and tasted very good. Also loved the little bowl of fruit accompanying this light breakfast before a fruit shopping experience!"}
{"text":"Good breakfast/lunch/coffee place to hit up after walking around the Jean Talon market.  We had a Montreal bagel here with smoked salmon (yum!).  If you never had a Montreal bagel before, you can do so here!  They're thinner and crispier than the bagels from NYC.  (They're also an ugly mis-shaped oval.)  I much prefer the NY bagel.  It's best to sit at the counter facing the street on a warm day to catch a gentle breeze and people-watch.  Otherwise, the back tables are very stuffy.  4/5 stools were taken when we went in late May so my friend and I sat in the back and ate as fast as we could.  There's hardly any ventilation there.  They also have omelettes, crepes, sandwiches, and parfaits.  The rest of the cafe menu looks good with a variety of coffee-based drinks."}
{"text":"surprised no one has reviewed this place. its in an amazing area and watching the market getting ready to open definitely added to the experience.   this is for their omelette which tasted amazing and looked so pretty that i almost didn't want to eat it. it certainly wasn't the omelette im used to having, it was actually more like a frittata in texture than say an american omellete that tends to be thinner and not as fluffy. it was nice they didn't overfill it with too much ham and cheese, because the highlight was the omellete and the quality of the eggs that i hope they got them from the market."}
{"text":"Tasty coffee and right next to the Marche. Stop here first for your coffee and then walk around. Nice staff as well."}
{"text":"While running Saturday morning errands at the Jean Talon market I was feeling a little peckish and in need of a boost of caffeine so I wandered in here.  It's a small and cozy cafe and it was nice to sit here, enjoy my food and watch the hustle and bustle of the market outside all the while being sheltered from the snow and cold.  I grabbed a quick latte and croissant and enjoyed sitting there watching the throngs of people go about their day at the Jean Talon market.  The latte was a little bit milky but it wasn't that big a deal.  The price was also very reasonable."}
{"text":"Été comme Hiver, cette place est là pour les lève tôt. Menu déjeuner et brunch sont présents. Le choix est intéressant et il est abordable. Il y a des places assises pour une clientèle assez nombreuse. Durant l'été il y a une jolie petite terrasse pour mieux profiter de l'activité du Marché Jean-Talon. Je le conseil à ceux qui aiment les classiques, comme le duo croissant et café."}
{"text":"Service à la clientèle 0. Avec un ami, on commande un café glacé. On règle et puis à la réception du café, on voit que le barista nous a fait un \"café au lait\" glacé. On signale que nous avions seulement demandé un café et pas de lait. A priori pas de souci, le barista se remet derrière sa machine, sauf qu'au moment de nous le donner, il nous lance sans aucune gène \"8$ SVP !\". Pardon ? Depuis quand un client doit payer pour les erreurs du personnel ?!  Si j'y retourne ? NON."}
{"text":"It is no secret that the Marché Jean Talon is by far one of my favourite places in Montreal. Everything pleases me during all year long.   This café is one of the precious places surrounding the Marché and it is a must go with you loved one. Small, cozy and with a very special menu for a brunch. You won't find those overwhelming brunches... just what you need. Eat calmly. Relax. During the summer you can have a seat outside and just watch families doing their groceries... street artists performing... and a beautiful sun to enjoy the weather."}
{"text":"Came up to this lovely terrasse right beside the Jean Talon Market one sunny morning and was greeted by the friendliest staff who welcomed me and my pup to sit down. I had a really nice and filling vegetarian breakfast: fresh fruit, eggs done exactly how I asked and even the bread for the toast was excellent. I will definitely be back for the price and the fact that my sidekick is welcome to chill with me and people watch in the best spot in the city!"}
