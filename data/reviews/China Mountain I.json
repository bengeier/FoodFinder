{"text":"Great food! Always fresh and hot. Got the Chinese ribs , Won Ton soup and my favorite, Shrimp Egg Foo Yung.."}
{"text":"This place was one of the best Chinese Takeout places in the city, but they've gone down in quality these last few years. They still have some of the best fried rice you can buy in Cleveland, and all of their entrees are solid."}
{"text":"Good food! Get rid of the guy with the glasses taking orders. He needs to be in the basement with that poor attitude..."}
{"text":"I have been going here for about 30 yrs, although I have had other Chinese restaurants food, I am usually sorry I didn't go to China Mountain. Excellent food fast service and great price."}
{"text":"The food is good and the service is fast. Prices are very reasonable as well. Been eating here since I was a teenager and I can't ever recall having an issue."}
{"text":"Delicious, fast, cheap, and open late.  Best Chinese takeout in Cleveland.  Always prompt service, always hits the spot after a night out or a long day at work.  And the pricing is outstanding, you can get enough fried rice to feed two people for less than $5."}
{"text":"I used to always eat at this China Mountain...but, I stopped because my rice was stringy and had a clear slim texture to it when I would stir it up."}
{"text":"I have been coming here almost 2 years with my fiance and this food is very delicious always fresh and reasonable price I live all the way in Parma and we come all the way here it is worth the ride"}
{"text":"I started teaching at Collinwood just this year and have come to love this place. It's typical take-out Chinese food but done very well with fresh vegetables. Really enjoyed the number 26 lunch special general Tso's chicken. Nice flavor and nice blend of sweetness and tanginess.

The food is prepared fresh, hot and fast and the family that runs it are quite friendly.

My only complaint might be that they're not going to help me keep my weight down especially over the winter."}
{"text":"Never left a review on yelp before but felt compelled to because of how awful the food was. Ordered the chicken chow mein: there were literally no noodles in the chow mein, just a huge mound of sauce-soaked bean sprouts. The other vegetables in the chow mein tasted awful. It was almost as if they'd drenched the dish in sauce to try to cover up that the vegetables had gone bad. The chicken was dry and extremely over-cooked. Will not order from them again"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time. Not good. Tasteless. Overcooked and dry meat. Too much oil. Honestly you'd have a better time at home eating bread and butter. It probably wouldn't give you a stomach ache afterwards too."}
{"text":"I ordered the shrimp and broccoli with extra shrimp. I still ended up with just 8 pieces of shrimp. So I guess regularly you only get 4 pieces!"}
{"text":"This was hands down the worst meal I have ever had so far. Ordered the shrimp roll and Hunan shrimp. Both were extremely taste less and smelled bad. Rolls each had one measly shrimp in them. I paid extra and ordered a large for the hunan shrimp (big mistake) - literally was 5 total shrimp in two pounds of frozen vegetables in a smelly brown sauce. Such tasteless and smelly food. I think they should be ashamed of selling such food to customers."}
{"text":"I was hoping that the mixed reviews would prove to be what they usually are, extremely mad people who only write bad things and the die hard fans. Well, unfortunately, the die hard fans aren't winning this one.  

The wontons in the wonton soup had no filling, the broth was very salty (I love salt so if it's salty for me it's probably realllly salty for most) and the pork strips were mostly fat. The beef noodle dish I ordered was heavily saturated with sauce that was over powering. And, I was really disappointed with how little beef was actually in the dish. 


I gave two stars because it arrived hot and timely."}
{"text":"I've been eating here for about 15 years never had a problem . The chicken teriyaki is my favorite. I've had their Wonton soup and it doesn't have a lot of meat in the dumplings or I would give this place 5 stars . There pepper steak is great , many of your commonly ordered meals are excellent, prices and quantity nice. Fast accurate service, and they sell these little hot oil cups , and hot sauce cups for 25 cents . Clean place!"}
{"text":"Ask yourself why you would even do this to yourself. Spend just a few extra dollars and get some Chinese that uses real ingredients. Really ... it's not worth it just to save a buck or two."}
{"text":"Been going here for years. When I went to high school, I would catch the bus up from Glenville and go and get some of their rice and chow mein. But something has changed in their food. Today, I ordered an egg roll, chicken fried rice and chicken chow mein. The first two were superb. Delicious as usual. But that chow mein looked like a culinary abortion. I opened the box and there weren't even noodles inside. Just a ton of bean sprouts and water chestnuts suspended in this slimy substance. It looked so unappetizing. The slime reminded me of something from Harry Potter (the scene where they have to get past the three headed dog, which drops drool onto Ron before they escape through the floor door) and from that movie called Beethoven, about the Saint Bernard. It looked like someone blew a snot rocket over and over again into the food. Needless to say, I threw it away. I have lost all desire to ever eat there again. I don't even want any Chinese food for awhile. They get three stars because they are pretty friendly and quick, but that food was a let down. What the f*** was that slimey stuff?"}
