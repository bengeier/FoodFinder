{"text":"Yummy Philipino Bbq Chicken & Pork skewers!    Been to the location in Scarborough which is huge as they have a full Buffett & retail store.    Got 6 skewers at $2.50 each.  Pretty good deal.   Also, got Aiza's Buko-Pandan chewy milk candy with young coconut.  I had a drink made from these green leaves at Dixie Mall and it was quite unique & healthy for you."}
{"text":"Alright, I should know my Filipino food better considering I dated a Filipino girl for a few years, but she never liked it and we'd never eat it, so yeah, I lack knowledge of it.  

However, here's the deal with this place:
-They got lots of hot food that looks yummy, including noodles, rice, various types of meats and veggies
-They got baked goods
-They got canned goods
-They got a few tables for you to sit at.

So like a Filipino version of 7-11 but better quality + hot food table. 

In terms of what I got, I think it was beef stew, spicy pork and noodles.  

The noodles were soft with a bit of kick and the spicy pork while tasty, wasn't really spicy. I thought they were more salty, but in a good way.  In terms of the beef stew, it was average.  I liked the meat, but wasn't exactly a fan of the flavour.

Verdict:  Not a bad place to get your Filipino food and groceries. Worth a shot."}
{"text":"Don't eat at this place. I felt like I was bothering the young girl servicing me. The pork spring rolls were dry. The sweet pork was all fat pieces. I recommend eating aye Mc Donalds at least you know what your getting."}
{"text":"It was my first time visiting a couple of days ago and I have to admit, the store is neatly set up for what it is..but it smelled a little (armpit) funky when we walked in there.. not sure if the vents were working but this place needed a reliable air conditioner because it was slightly humid in there too.

Food wise, it was okay.. the spread selection was a lot (compared to the other ones I came across) and I did enjoy their bopis but not so much of the pork one I got (forgot the name). The turon we also got was kinda soggy on the inside but it was still good.

They also sell some snacks on the side and they have some refrigerators filled with sweets and stuff that you would normally buy back in the Philippines. Oh, and by the cash register also they sell those lotto tickets too.

Overall, our experience was okay. Very decent. I just got really turned off with the smell when we walked in."}

I have been a loyal customer of this location from it's tiny store in the back of this plaza to this (much needed) larger location and up-graded to \"hot meals\" served daily. The friendly staff will patiently describe the contents of any meal they serve."}
