{"text":"To put it simply, if you are looking to indulge on a chicken pita, this is the place to go. Rapid service, friendly staff, and conveniently located on Sherbrooke street, this joint does not disappoint. In addition, their fries are so addictive. Go see for yourself, you will not be disappointed. Their fries play an important role in my love life."}
{"text":"Love it here! Plates are a generous size and at a fair price.. Service is pretty quick too, which is especially convenient for pick-up!"}
{"text":"I love villa it's a land mark. Good place to bring kids it's cheap and always good, the spanakopita is by far the best I've tasted and the pitas are wrapped the best from any-other souvlaki place. I love it!"}
{"text":"We love going here whether it's Saturday night or a busy weekday. The restaurant is clean, and good-sized. It isn't a fancy-kind of place.  We usually order two chicken platters, which are two chicken sticks with dressed cucumbers, potato fries and pita. All of this always goes well with a cherry cola, that we split. The food comes quick and good, and it is always the same. It is a classic in our family and we enjoy coming here."}
{"text":"Happy to live just a few blocks from this spot.  Can be a little pricey for gyros and such but always tasty."}
{"text":"Nice casual walk up and order Greek restaurant.  Amazing lunch specials Monday to Friday.  I had the gyro plate, meat cooked well and the salad was fresh.  Park on side streets, it is hard to find parking directly in front  (very few spots)."}
{"text":"This place is casual take out/eat in diner style eating. 
Love this place! I always get the pork or chicken pita and fries. My co-eater always gets a vegetarian, and my really picky friend demands sliced gyro on a pita with nothing- no sauce no tomatoes nothing(!!) but onions...  and for every one of us- individually, it is our favorite Greek place both in and outside Montreal. And we will drive from far! That is saying something... 
why???
It is always consistent. 
The veg is super fresh and crispy.
The tzatziki is delicious- creamy and thick ( I have to ferret it to NY on a regular basis to family)
They always cook the meat perfectly. 
Their fries are awesome! Old school waffle-like fries- utterly addictive...
Great service! Always!
(The parking sucks... it's on a really busy intersection- go early and swoop above prud'homme)"}
{"text":"After growing up in Montreal, \"Villa\"....as I foundly refer to Villa du Souvlaki, is a must when I come home to visit.
The food has not changed in the 26 yrs I have been going.
The souvlaki pita is still as good as always, and the silver dollar fries are indeed meant to be dipped in the best taziki sauce in Montreal.
Never disappointed, and always a must."}
{"text":"I was introduced to Villa a few years ago and it is a regular spot when we want to pick up a quick, tasty meal.

It is not the best souvlaki I have ever eaten but considering my all time favorite is an hour and a half a way, this will satisfy my craving.

It is a cute, clean, little restaurant where you can eat in, but  it is best for pick up. 

I've tried a variety of dishes here but i generally stick to my tried and trues. 

Things I like:

Souvlaki plate: you can order one or two souvlaki sticks, I prefer the chicken to the pork. It is usually tender and marinated well but it could use more flavor in my opinion. The Greek salad is always fresh, big chunk of feta, a few olives, tomatoes and cucumbers but once again, lacking zest, the dressing is pretty bland. The fries are definitely amazing, generous portion, dollar size coins that are crispy on the outside and  tender on the inside with the perfect amount if salt. It doesn't come with tzatziki but it is delicious as well! It also comes with some garlic bread which is pretty basic but nice. If you order this at lunchtime it comes with a free soft drink so you are getting quite a filling portion for about 12$.

I've also enjoyed the spanikopita, the grape leaves and the baklava.

All in all, a tasty spot for a quick meal. Considering it is very close to home, it is a place I go to on a regular basis."}
{"text":"quick service and satisfying food. Beware on plates Greek sauce is extra?? Food portion, flavour is short"}
{"text":"Seriously?  With so many glowing reviews we were expecting some delicious food.  Not the case.

I admit, I was a bit indecisive at first and the line slowly grew during the lunch time rush.  Sorry about that!  Either way, I wanted to make the best choice.  

We were bringing the food to a friend's place for lunch.  So, my husband ordered three lunch plates to go.  The chicken, pork, and gyros.  They each came with a can of pop.

When we got to our friend's place, we quickly opened up the paper bags.  There was a plastic bag with 6 pieces of garlic bread.  Pretty average stuff.  We opened the containers of food: where was the tzatziki sauce???  Who eats Greek food with no tzatziki???  Now I'm just annoyed.  The meat skewers were not juicy at all, they were actually dry.  The gyros was like eating strips of leather.  Some decent tzatziki would've helped but we had none.  The only saving grace was the slice of feta that topped the tasteless salads of cucumbers, tomatoes, onions, and measly olives. The pickled peppers were decent.  I guess the fried potatoes were passable; at least the ones that were not swimming in the liquid (water) that was supposed to be dressing which had accumulated at the bottom of the containers.  Yuck.

Not impressed.  Not going back.  It's too bad because the restaurant was clean and spacious.  Maybe eating in would've been a better experience.  I will never know."}
{"text":"Went three times-twice dining in, once doing takeout. Will not go again for the following: the overwhelming feeling of being nickle and dimed for everything. Their menu is confusing, no explanation on the board about what the plates include and since it's a Greek joint, and every Greek fast food place I've been to includes stuff like tzatziki, I ended up assuming things lol. The prices are already pretty high, but if you get the gyro platter and want the meat in a pita (or just want ANY pita at all on the side), they charge you $1 per pita. The pita is not anything special and when you are already paying something like $13 for a plate, it gets annoying. On top of it, only certain items get you some tzatziki (like the doner/sandwhiches), otherwise you have to pay extra. So if you get a platter, you end up with a pile of meat, no pita, and greek salad and fries and no tzatziki. They do, oddly enough, bring some sort of garlic bread when you first sit down....useless, would rather have a pita!
I could overlook this but in reality, the only star on their menu in terms of meat is the gyro meat in the platter. The chicken and pork are not tasty at all (chicken not seasoned and pork chewy). Will say though that their fries (little silver dollars) are tasty though.
Cash only I believe, another hurdle. 
I also saw on my second trip there a man waiting for his order. Quite a ways into waiting, he saw what the men at the grill were making and clarified his order with the cashier girl. Turns out she made a mistake and the first thing the owner says is \"oh you owe us money then\".  They (cashier and owner) then proceeded to hunch over a calculator doing a million calculations for at LEAST 10 minutes only to end up saying \"you owe us 80 CENTS\"!!! I couldn't believe the hooplah over that small amount of money when it was the cashier who had made the mistake. However, it makes sense when I think about all the extra cost they try to tack on. The cashier girl is also super unfriendly and doesn't like explaining the menu. We tried to change over from Village Grec to this place since it's closer and wanted to try something new, but nah."}
{"text":"These folks are NOT messing around - if you want a great gyro pita and fries and terrific tzatziki, you really need to try it.
Nice little dining room, extremely nice young girls that work there.
The guys that work the grill are terrific.
They even have pretty good feta - most of these little gyro places have cheap feta, but this one isn't bad at all."}
{"text":"Coming from a Greek girl I would have to say this location and Tripolis are one of the bests I've ever had. Gyros are on point! and by on point I mean the meat is cooked perfectly and no its not that thin fake mock imitation \"gyro meat\" its the real deal. They garnish it with onions and tomatoes and their signature tzatziki. They have delicious little crinkled potato fries much like marathons, they are shaped like little flat pebbles sent from god himself! the salad wasn't my favorite but they make fantastic wraps.

Service is always quick from the moment you call and within 10-15 its ready for pick up.
Free Garlic Bread (yay) sit in and take out.
FYI ONLY CASH (Theres an RBC ATM in the gas station across the street)"}
{"text":"I have to confess something about Villa and that's that, while I love their souvlaki and think their tzatiki sauce is really top-hole, the real reason I keep returning is probably those fantastic round fries. 

Yes, the ones I can probably get at any grocery store. The ones I could order at a dozen other restaurants. The frozen ones.

I even admit that I occasionally profess to be a foodie, but I love these fries so much that I cannot even muster the appropriate level of shame. They're just super salty, super crispy and super good."}
{"text":"A definite go to restaurant for casual dining. Decor is average but clean. I always get a souvlaki sandwich. The fries are ok."}
{"text":"Do you like great souvlaki? Black cherry cola? God's own french fries? Then Villa du Souvlaki is for you.

Not a thing has changed in at least 20 years and why should it. The food is fantastic, the prices are incredible (there are still many pita options under $5), and the atmosphere is casual (order and pay at the cash, then they bring you your food). This is one of my favourite places to eat, here or anywhere."}
{"text":"For the quality : price ratio, you're better off making the trip to Marathon instead."}
{"text":"The souvlaki is good, not fantastic. Going back to VDS brings back memories of when I lived in Montreal and souvlaki was my staple diet. It did not live up to my memories. I have been spoiled by good gyros in San Francisco"}
{"text":"I find this souvlaki restaurant to be the best in NDG. I have tried other souvlaki restaurants in the west end and they are not as good as Villa du Souvlaki. It has been here for years at the corner of Prudhomme and Sherbrooke West. It is very clean and airy with table arrangements that provide adequate space for any number of diners. I often see families eating here. Additionally, they provide an exterior ramp for wheelchair access, very thoughtful and considerate!

I usually order the gyro pita all dressed and a side order of French fries. The fries are crispy round brown ridged fries that are crunchy and great with ketchup and vinegar that is readily available at all tables. The gyros are also excellent with very fresh ingredients (especially the tomatoes) and a great tzatziki sauce. They both were served in baskets. At lunchtime, they serve trio type specials that are worth trying and are less expensive.

The routine is to place your order at the counter, pay and sit down at one of the tables. The food is prepared in an open manner out front directly behind the cashier and not behind closed doors. One of the waitresses will bring your plate to your table when it is ready and service has always been fast when I have visited. An all dressed gyro pita and French fry cost a little under 10 dollars, tip not included, cash only."}
{"text":"I grew up in NDG, which included regular visits to Villa du Souvlaki when it was too warm to cook.  Villa du Souvlaki is an inexpensive Greek restaurant located right by Vendome metro.  The order is done at a counter, where your food is brought to your table.  Villa du Souvlaki offers lots of seating and air conditioning during the summer months.

Villa offers limited vegetarian options including the vegetarian \"souvlaki\", Greek salad, dolmades, spanakopita and round French fries.  I've never had fries like there's anywhere else.  It's one of the reasons I keep coming back.  

The food is cooked take-out style, meaning everything's cooked very quickly and served in paper plates.  If you're looking for inexpensive, quick, fresh Greek food, then you must visit Villa du Souvlaki."}
{"text":"Excellent chicken pita roll! The salad was very soso... But what a delicious souvlaki wrap!"}
{"text":"Wow....the tzatziki is flipping amazeballs. GET IT!

I had a gyro wrap which came with probably some of the most amazing 'chips' I've ever had. Seriously, I don't know what it was that made them so yummy but they were. The gyro was also really well made and the prices were pretty good.

If I come back to the area, I definitely need to come here again."}
{"text":"I have been a Villa fan since 1983. Authentic Greek food - simple menu but super high quality ingredients. Best souvlaki in Montreal. No alcohol, but unreal food and service."}
{"text":"Totally awesome food.

I went with gf, we ordered two plates (Sandwich + Fries, Salad). I had the doner kebab, gf had vegetarian souvlaki.

Great, fresh ingredients. Will definitely go back. We went for a mild hangover meal, and it turned out feeling somewhat healthy.

We ate on site. It's simple/cafeteria like, but clean. Friendly staff. It's just about their sandwiches/food, simple, but reaallly good."}
{"text":"Chicken pita and a fry. All you need. Best fries with a little salt. The chicken pitas are always on point. Their Greek salad lacks a little seasoning but still pretty solid. Good spot for a quick 10$ dinner. Their garlic bread is good as well."}
{"text":"I have tried so many souvlaki restaurants on my frequent visits to Montreal, and I have finally found SOUVLAKI  NIRVANA.... parking is a major pain though but a ticket is a small price to pay for this outstanding culinary experience...."}
{"text":"This place has the best fries, bar none. Order that and some tzatziki as a dip and you're in for a treat! I also took a Gyro pita and black cherry cola and this lunch REALLY hit the spot.

I recommend to try this place at least once.

Service was good and the price tag was very good."}
{"text":"Delicious food at a reasonable price. Friendly and quick service. Simple decor. Cash only, unfortunately!"}
{"text":"This place has been sitting on this corner for ages, in fact as far back as I can remember and incredibly enough, I only got the chance to try it out for the first time yesterday.

This is not a fancy-bones Greek souvlaki establishment. In fact, if you were to go to Greece, most of the best souvlaki joints are usually hole-in-the wall establishments serving up amazing take-out. If it's fancy, that's usually not a good sign.

While small, this place is very clean and judging from the conversations around me, many of the folks inside were regulars. Service was friendly and you can't beat the price for what you get. I ordered up a souvlaki plate and it came with two sticks, two pieces of garlic bread, a Greek salad full of chunky cut cucumbers, tomatoes, sweet onions, black olives and a slab of feta and probably the most amazing thick-cut, traditional Greek Fries (yes, Greek Fries as opposed to French Fries) I've had in quite a while. I really don't understand how the Greeks do it: taking simple, peasant food, with very few ingredients and elevating it to tasty, zesty goodness. 

Ask for the hot sauce, it's particularly amazing on the fries!"}
{"text":"Just left Poseur San Fran. God I hate their Gyros - Hamburger meat, ice berg lettuce and ranch dressing on a stale pita folded over like a taco. Why can't Greek Americans master the art of Pita rolling. Thankfully I was headed to Mtl and got fixed up at VDS! Still the BEST! FU SF!!!"}
{"text":"What a HUGE disappointment. I don't even know where to begin. My friend and I went here based on a (poor) recommendation. We are NYC Greeks, so we know good Greek food. This was not good Greek food. 

We ordered two gyros, an order of FF, and a Greek salad. The Feta on the Greek salad was generic (fake) feta, the olive (one olive) in the salad was of the worst quality, the tomatoes and cucumbers were virtually tasteless. It was a sorry excuse for a Greek salad. 

The gyros were loaded with too much tzatziki. The tzatziki was OK, but again, not real Greek tzatziki. The pita bread was more like an Arabic flatbread, not real Greek pita bread. 

The only decent thing we ordered were the fries. I can see how this place is good to people who never really had REAL GREEK FOOD, but for NYC Greeks who spend their summers in Greece and the rest of the year eating at some of the best Greek Restaurants in Astoria or Manhattan, this is a total disappointment.

The worst part of this experience was the service. The lady working the counter was extremely unfriendly. We walked in and noticed that they are cash only. No big deal. We had American dollars. I asked the lady if we can pay with American dollars and she said fine, but that she will charge a 10% fee. No big deal again, but I noticed that once i handed over the American dollars she started to treat us differently. She was actually quite rude. My friend, who is the SWEETEST person you will ever meet, also pointed out how poor she treated us.

We came all the way from across town. What a waste of time and round trip Uber fare."}
{"text":"Good service, honest dishes, fast, they serve hot bread .. C'est classe ... also many tables, the only thing i did not like is the sticky table .. And no really A.C..."}
