{"text":"Went to uptown Grill for the first time today. The place was very clean and neat. Had a cheeseburger with french fries and an ice tea. My brother-in-law had a fried bologna sandwich and said it was one of the best he has had. Food was fantastic and I'm really looking forward to going back and trying their Reuben sandwich."}
{"text":"Well for the first time there  The food an service was excellent  .. o orderd a bbq bacon cheese burger an fresh cut fries.  So freaking good.... my husband even gir a free whole pie for him being Marine,  we will defiantly go back"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped for an early dinner.  Place was very clean and had a local feel to it.  The burgers are good and the fries are fresh cut.  Give this place a try, you will not be disappointed.  The owners are from Cuyahoga Falls and support all local teams."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this restaurant has closed. We thoroughly enjoyed the food and the staff working there. Uptown was a great place to go for a burger after a long week! Hopefully, everyone finds new employment quickly and have a successful future."}
{"text":"I tried their burgers at the hamburger festival and just HAD to check this place out. Very small diner feel to it but much cleaner than a typical diner/small neighborhood place. The burgers were reasonably priced and VERY good, my wife loved hers also, and 2 of my daughters did as well. My third daughter got a roast beef sub and finished the whole thing. the fresh cut fries were awesome (think Hamburger station for you local folks), and the service was fast and incredibly friendly. I'd highly recommend checking this place out if you live in the area, and if you're passing through and want a great meal in a clean environment with friendly staff you could certainly do a lot worse than here. After one meal I plan to become a regular.   (possibly the cleanest restaurant bathrooms I've ever seen)."}
