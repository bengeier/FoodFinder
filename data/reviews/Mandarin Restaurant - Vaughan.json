{"text":"Been to a few different Mandarin restaurant locations and this one seems to be my top pick so far.

Been there several times already for regular dinners and birthday occasions, and their foods and services have been outstanding. Staff are well trained for providing very courteous services. Foods are either meeting or exceeding expectation.

Just a tip, foods at weekends seemed to be slightly fresher, especially for seafood like snow crab legs or shrimps, but that does *not* mean weeknights are bad. It is probably just because turn-around of food are better durin weekend times, so do the crowds too! ;)"}
{"text":"I was here for the first time last week! I went with about four co-workers for yet another office lunch. Always enjoyable food, and a pretty busy crowd considering it was lunchtime on a Wednesday. Our waitress was super helpful, as one of my co-workers has a list of food allergies. The waitress was able to tell us what was in every dish, and which ones to steer away from. Definitely going to come here again!!"}
{"text":"This buffet is very good for me . My son just ice cream  and I so like king crab ...Price is so much for weekend  ."}
{"text":"I usually come here for family ocassions or just for fun with my family but only maybe twice a year.

Last time we came with my family there was a BIG line up. Witch is normal since it's a buffet.

We got seated in a room but in the very corner,
It was a problem beacause none of the waiters could see us and never came to ask us for drinks or refills. (Recommend not to sit in the corner behind the wall)



Some of the food I really like while others I didn't, but I love how they have many foods to pick from!!

The desserts okay, and the kids loved the icecream that they could pick from.

Overall I do recommend this place ! And would come back but not often."}
{"text":"Love mandarin! My fave buffet! Staff are always awesome and food is great. Leave the place full and satisfied."}
{"text":"The worse of the worse.... Alh my kids can eat is Cotton candy...
Not much selection to eat. Sushi is not fresh."}
{"text":"This chain has consistent fast fresh food in all locations I've visited throughout the years. 

It isn't suppose to be authentic Chinese food, so I don't rate or compare based on that. 

It's a Canadian Chinese restaurant concept and it's execution is superb.  . 

All locations have an extensive salad bar, soup, BBQ, hot foods, drink menu and desert section. This makes it popular place to please a wide variety of patrons palettes.

As for service, I've never had a complaint here. They are very friendly (sometimes so much is feel fake :p ), everybody including the chef, hostesss, and most especially your table servers. 

From Barrie, Newmarket, North York, Scarborough, Markham Brampton, and this location I'm reviewing in Woodbridge I would say they are all consistently good. 

I just choose based on location not because one place does the food better.

Really I don't know why all the hate for it. Ah haters will be haters."}
{"text":"Worst parking out of all mandarins*.. Not enough spots..
Otherwise just like all the other ones. Good \"Chinese\" food.

*yonge and eglinton is pretty bad parking too, but they have plenty of spots there, you just have to pay."}
{"text":"Arrived 2:00 pm Monday, daughters birthday. We were advised we had till only 3:30 pm as dinner would be served then and was that ok, we said yes, and we are glad we did. Food was excellent Moon Festival event, fish galore, wife and daughter in heaven they love fish, I found New York steak at the grill, 3 nice pieces good blue just for me, everything else was hot and fresh right up until after 3:00 pm, considering they were closing to get ready at 3:30 pm for dinner. Selections too numerous to mention, all flavours were crisp and bold and hot what should be hot and cold what should be cold. We will definitely be hard pressed to choose between here and the Barrie Mandarin. Thank-you for a fine lunch."}
{"text":"Honestly these days there's not great value out of this place.  On the weekends they break out crab legs but after tax and tip it's almost 40 bucks a person even if you don't buy drinks.  

I understand it's all you can eat but I don't know many people that can get their money's worth for this place unless you're only or mostly eating seafood.

I'd rather just order Chinese from my local place and save over 60 dollars (based on 2 people) but this place is more of a special occasion place for us.  It was a relative's birthday as it usually is when we come to this place.  We've been here a bunch of times and there are some changes that they've done lately.

They've added some raw fish to the sushi area but I noticed they don't make any actually sushi (nigiri or maki) with raw fish.  They have like 3 varieties or so of raw fish (red tuna, salmon, white tuna) to the side.  I tried the red tuna and the salmon and they didn't taste that great and/or they didn't seem very chilled.  Health hazard?  Maybe some of the hot food on my plate warmed it up a bit but it just wasn't as good.  I've had sashimi at all you can eat buffets in Miami and it's night and day.

These days a weekend cost if you don't eat seafood is NOT worth it IMO.  40 dollars after tax and tip is a lot for Chinese food considering you can get a lot of Chinese food for well under 30 dollars to feed more than 3 people and this place is much more for just one person.

I didn't see too many dishes empty so they do fill them up fast, even the crab which I had none of and they do have a decent variety of food but it's not worth 40 dollars per person during the weekends (busy time)."}
{"text":"It's clean here. They do put older food on top of new food ... I'm in the food management service and you shouldn't be doing that ... but besides that it's a good place to eat ... all you can eat."}
{"text":"You require reservations. Even then, you will find empty tables, so that was a little questionable. Beyond that, our server was impressive and the food was great - considering it is a buffet. Meets expectations - what are you expecting? It's Mandarin!"}
{"text":"We were handed hot towels and were asked if we would like to order a drink. Then we head to the buffet. I asked the manager what their vegan options were and he was extremely professional, knowledgeable, and helpful. They offer a meh amount of vegan options. Chicken broth is unnecessarily added to some of their otherwise vegetarian or vegan dishes.

I gotta say the hot towel was a nice touch. Place is quite spacious and is good for groups. Friendly service. Staff are always smiling and attentive even when busy. At the end we were handed another hot towel and a fortune cookie."}
{"text":"I love mandarin...yes I know it's very \"american\" and I know you have to make reservations or prepare to wait...and dinner can be pricey ($21/person) but I love it. Where else can you get fried rice, fried chicken, chicken balls, french fries, roast beef, mashed potatoes, sushi, pizza and shrimp under one roof? No matter when you go and which location you go to they don't dissapoint. I love their variety of salads, their delicious wonton soup and mouth-watering dishes and their tempting desserts! And best of all you eat until you can't move..lol"}
{"text":"Mandarin is my family's go to place for a celebration. We go here probably 4-5 times a year. The nice thing about buffets is that it caters to everyone even the picky eaters. 

Recently I came here to celebrate my nephew's 10th birthday. There were about 24 of us including 10 rowdy kids. The kids were being kids and birthday boy even managed to break a glass. Simply put we were a pretty annoying group and I would hate to be our server lol. 

What really impressed me was how our servers handled us. They were very patient and polite and even calmed the boys down a bit. Our drinks were always filled and plates were taken away pretty quickly. 

The Food was okay but the service was very impressive."}
{"text":"Terrible service.
Long story short; There was a huge line up. Families with hungry children...
And they were making people wait.... There a huge section open with only a few tables occupied, and they made excuses to not sit people, on a weekday evening. So we tried speaking to the manager with an IQ of a 3 year old.  That was a waste of time, and a bunch of families just left! We ended up at jack Astros and had the best time! With amazing service and food."}
{"text":"I have been going to Mandarin about once or twice a year since 1989.  As a child, this was the best place to eat - when food was about quantity instead of quality.  

The reason they have succeeded in my opinion is that they are consistent.  When you go to Mandarin, you know what you're going to get.   Decent service and lots of food choices for you to gorge on.   

Mandarin is a westernized Chinese buffet restaurant.  They have a selection of the western Chinese food classics - pork ribs, chicken balls, fried rice, spicy green beans, crispy chicken wings.  They have western foods during dinner - roast beef, mashed potatoes, frozen pizza, steamed carrots, grilled steakettes, chicken and sausage.  They also have a few desserts: a decent selection of ice cream, cakes, strawberry.  Salads and soups etc!  Lots!

Lunch runs you about $15 a person while dinner is about $30 with taxes.   The $15 difference is noticeable ie. all the expensive and good stuff (crab legs, prime rib, chocolate strawberries, sushi-ish) is available only for dinner.

When I was young, I'd eat anything and everything.

But now - I'm about maximizing value when I go there.  This is essentially what I eat when I'm there (dinner):

Plate #1: 10 steamed crab legs, 6 breaded shrimp sushi roll pieces and 6 Philadelphia cream cheese roll pieces and smoked salmon sushi pieces.

Plate #2: see plate 1

Plate #3: see plate 1 - I might add a slice of roast beef and/or grilled chicken

Plate #4 - 3 steamed crab legs.

Plate #5 - dessert - 3 chocolate covered strawberries and a waffle quarter with a scoop of ice cream.

The wait staff clear our each of your finished plates quickly, and keep the glasses of water filled.

It isn't fine dining - it doesn't claim to be.  It's plenty, quick and fairly tasty - consistently so.  It's this consistent quality that has kept me coming back.

{"text":"I'm one of those guys that thought negatively about Mandarin growing up.  Maybe I was SHORT and that all the adults at a busy Mandarin blocked my vision to the food and I had to wait until my turn.  It was also considered \"Canadian\" and \"Expensive\" especially the ONLY time I went during dinner.

It wasn't until co-workers taking me back to this Mandarin for Lunch that I've noticed a different vision.  I'm the one IN-CHARGE now and expensive only refers to dinner and not LUNCH.  In my books Lunch has value and dinner does not.

Mandarin does special CELEBRATIONS and that's usually the period when we go and eat because there's EXCITEMENT in the air or at least NOISY patrons but it's expected of a buffet place.

Nothing out of the usual in terms of the Decor, Setup, Food, Service, etc...  I've experienced a 30 min wait here once, as I'm told from the hostess because I fled once I heard the wait time.

The FORTUNE COOKIES do not have Lucky Lotto Numbers anymore and sometimes you might want to ask for more than 1 Cookie as the last few times with a table of 6+ we tend to get duplicates of each others.  I'm BAD LUCK so I don't believe anyone can have my identical fate!

I tend to do my own STRATEGY at buffets but now it comes second-nature.  It's also one of the GREAT places to experiment with your PLATING DESIGNS.  No one will judge you and you have all the time in the world to play around."}
{"text":"I have been coming to the Mandarino for years. Over time they have changed and each location also seems to cater to their local community. 

Every location has the water feature in the front

Every location has little umbrellas in their signature drinks

This restaurant has become a place for groups to celebrate special occasions because it can satisfy every guests tastes including Mr.  McDonalds

That guy can have roast beef, mashed potatoes with gravy, and corn Niblett and a  casa salad

Mr chinois will enjoy some asian treats 

Kids go crazy for the dessert bar and pizza slices 

Being a pizzaiolo means I am critical of their horrible pizza but it's for kids not for people like me

One thing that has changed over the years is a better sushi story with more selection.  Sadly it still is a generic offering and their customers don't mind. Jiro who? They ask

For 35 years they have truly offered a big spread and a chance for customers to fill their belly to the brim (which they do) with a very fresh offering of Chinese food

One thing that the group table commented on was how the plates are smaller. That just means you take 2 extra trips to the trough and battle through the crowd around the torpedo shrimps

In order to beat the owner and push him into poverty by eating more than what you pay requires arriving hungry and having a systematic approach to loading your plate on each trip

My 3 tips are to enjoy a half portion of soup as your starter and to scope out the hot grill servings where they may have sirloin steak right off the grill. Don't have garlic bread or buns as that can fill you up with empty carbs that can be better served with more kung pao chicken"}
{"text":"Was at this location for our office Christmas lunch.  Very polite server.  Loved the food!  An abundance of it!  Be sure to book a table in advance no matter when you go.  We were there on a weekday afternoon and it was packed with people.  Luckily we did book a table.  I love Mandarin!  Would go anytime!"}
{"text":"Wow!! I'd love to be able to say I managed to get far enough to even TRY the food, but after explaining myself over and over and over again that my cell phone number wasn't a local number and NO I don't have a house phone, I managed to get my order together, she didn't understand the address, I spelled it out for her and gave her directions and she still didn't understand, she didn't take the credit card I had on hand so I had to call back, I called back and she insisted I come pick up my order then when I said \"no, I can't come pick it up\" she forwarded me to the manager.  

Not worth the hassle, I hung up and called a different Chinese restaurant that actually seems to want my business!!! No problems with the address at all ... Weird Eh?"}
{"text":"This place was awesome! Was craving Chinese food for lunch but didn't have the chance to go till dinner. We came at 730pm and the place was packed. Was told that the wait was 45mins but ended up bring seated sooner. Our server, Jacky, was great and very attentive - he even sang Happy Birthday for our friend Teena with matching birthday cupcake and a picture souvenir.  The food was excellent and I especially loved the fried shrimp  and endless desserts. Will definitely visit again the next time we are in Toronto."}
{"text":"This place is incredibly unorganized. 

I called them weeks in advance to book seating for my baby shower. I told them my name and the number of people attending. 

When the day finally arrived, me and two friends came a few minutes early to settle into our table. We were seated in a reserved room filled with jesus decorations. I asked which table was ours as there were 4 large tables in the room. We were told that the whole room was reserved for us and that the decorations are \"special\". 

We picked the table furthest away from jesus and his angels and began waiting for the rest of the guests. Next, many people arrived but none were my guests. 

Sitting in a room half full of seniors, we were wondering whats up with the dirty looks and why all of this is happening in our section. 

Finally we were told that the name was confused and that this room is not for us (duh!). We were moved to another table, and then shortly, moved again to be seated with two of my guests that showed up 30 minutes ago while we were still sitting in the jesus room! 
As soon as we all began laughing at the start of our dinner, my phone rang. It was another guest asking which mandarin i ended up hosting the shower at because she was told that there is no table reserved under my name. As i was coming out to meet her, they were already letting her in. 
The entire expected guest list did not show up, leaving two empty chairs at our 12 seat table. The whole time we were eating the wait staff kept coming by and interrupting conversation to ask if the other guests are coming, and if they are then when.  It wasnt busy on that Sunday and there were plenty of empty table around - there was no need to be bothering us over two extra chairs especially after you moved us three times and told my guests im not here ! 

Dont plan large events here... they can't handle them!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and food was good! Would recommend going later in the evening so it is not as crowded when getting food. Selection of food was great as I am not a picky eater and love my desserts!"}
{"text":"On Jan. 28/17 I went to the Weston Road Mandarin in Vaughan specifically for the Dumpling Festival to have some Har Gow. At first I could not find them as I was looking for steamed Har Gow in rice flour as per their advertisement and as Har Gow are supposed to be prepared. I found them but they had been deep fried in very thick batter and were not very good. The Shiu Mai were also dried out and I found the quality of food overall to be a little overcooked and dried out. There was something called \"little baskets\" which were very dried out and like chewing straw. I was very disappointed in the Har Gow and was very annoyed as I came specifically to enjoy this specific dish but did not say anything to the restaurant as I did not see the point.  If they had properly prepared Har Gow available they would be serving it.  
I complained to Mandarin's head office requesting a refund so that I could go to a different Mandarin before the festival ends to enjoy properly prepared Har Gow and better quality food.  They refused to give me any refund: not even $10 to cover some Har Gow. The Weston Mandarin offered an apology but that was it and the head office supported them refusing to address my complaint themselves.  I was very disappointed in Mandarin's response to this issue and will be avoiding all of these restaurants in the future. I will never go to the Weston Road Mandarin again.  They don't need my business and clearly do not value their customers."}
{"text":"They came to check on our table multiple times. The food is great and the restaurant is really clean."}
{"text":"My visit to this location was typical of a Mandarin. However the atmosphere here was rather dark, despite it being a sunny day outside. I went as part of a large party, and the service was great. Plates were cleared very quickly, water and other refreshments were topped up frequently. The food left more to be desired. We went during lunch, and there were certain dishes that were just poorly made. An example would be the salmon sushi: they made it using smoked salmon instead of sushi-grade/prepared salmon. Although for a lunch buffet, the variety of food was huge (as with most Mandarins) the quality of the food was average. Some of the food was overcooked, others just poorly cooked. Staple foods like rice or noodle dishes were fine. This restaurant gets 3 solid stars for food variety, and great service. But I can't find any reason to give them more."}
{"text":"By now, if you haven't visited a Mandarin Restaurant, you must be living under a rock. They seem to be popping up everywhere.

Anyways....as you enter the restaurant you're greeted by a chorus of staff yelling their catch phrase.... \"Welcome to the Mandarin\". It's uncanny how they are all in synch and in tune with each other. 

A host/hostess will escort you to your table and along the way you'll pass by the buffet. They will make small chit chat with you and explain the buffet stations and explain any specials they have. Once seated, your server is usually at the table within a few minutes.

The buffet is massive...there are the following stations:
Chinese Food (usually 2 stations)
Salads and Soups
Desserts - pastries, cakes, pies, ice creams
Sushi 
Mixed - Roast Beef, pizza, etc

For a buffet, the food isn't bad...probably one of the best when it comes to choice, price and quality. The service is friendly but they know that you're there for the buffet so they stay out of your way. Empty plates are cleared away quickly. Beer is reasonably priced although some of the mixed drinks can be a bit pricey.

In order to suit the clientele and the restaurant is a buffet, the food is Canadianized/Americanized Chinese food so the fare is: Chicken Balls, Lemon Chicken, Springs Rolls, Pepper Beef (the spiciest dish I've had here), noodles, rice, etc. If this is what you like when you have Chinese Food this is the place for you."}
{"text":"I was organizing a small get together for my sister's birthday and everything was managed very well. Except towards the end when the waiter was indirectly telling me what to tip her. She automatically put in the % for the tip, which I thought was pretty rude. If I am paying I should be the judge of how much to tip, not the waiter."}
{"text":"I can't review the food as I didn't eat anything from here. I did email their head office about vegan options and this was their reply \" Thank you for contacting us with your question about vegan items on our
all-you-can-eat buffet. 

Our vegan buffet selection is limited, as many of our meatless items contain
egg or milk products. However, you may find some food items that are
suitable for a vegan diet on our salad bar.  Steamed rice is always
available. If you don't see steamed rice on our buffet, please as your
server or a restaurant manager.  We also offer fresh fruit on our dessert
buffet. Some of our sushi rolls contain vegetables only as well.    

We would like to let you know that most of the items on our hot buffet would
not be suitable for a vegan diet.  Most of our hot buffet items contain meat
or seafood, or chicken base as an ingredient. 

We suggest that you consider ordering from our a-la-carte menu.  If you
order from our menu, our kitchen may be able to prepare an item as
requested.  You may be able to request a dish from our menu be prepared
without chicken base, or other animal products.  Please discuss this option
with a restaurant manager.  They may also be able to help you find the items
on the buffet that are most suitable for your diet when you dine there or
call in prior to your visit. Please note that our a-la-carte menu is
available at the manager's discretion.  On very busy days, the a-la -carte
