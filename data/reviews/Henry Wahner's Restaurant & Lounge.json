{"text":"I read the other reviews and went anyway-  BUYER BEWARE!  This was one of THE WORST restaurant experiences I've ever had!  A group of 20 of us had planned to eat here after an event. We called for reservations, which they do not take- first come, first serve and all members of your party must be present to be seated.  Not a problem. We decided to break up the group as we arrived and just ask to be seated in smaller groups.  My group contained 4 and was the first to arrive.... At 4:45. We were quickly seated.  The 2nd group contained 12 and they were seated about 5-10 minutes behind us. The 3rd group contained 3 and arrived half an hour after my group.  We were greeted by our server after 10 minutes by her telling us that she would be right with us.  10 minutes after that, she finally came back and took our drink order simultaneously with our meal order.  In the meantime, two nearby tables were finished and leaving, grumbling about the same server's service, or rather, lack thereof.  As we were placing our orders, I looked over to see that our 2nd group (which arrived 10 minutes after us) already had their salads!  We were just placing or drink orders!  Nearly an hour after my group of 4 arrived, we still didn't have our food and the group of 12 was finished!  When we inquired with our waitress, she dressed us down like little children, blaming it on what we ordered, that there was a group of 40 in the back room, claimed that the group of 12 arrived before us, etc.  She let us know that she was a fantastic server and everyone loved her.  I can say that I have never encountered such a rude or cantankerous server! We finally got up and started to leave. As we were walking out, she came rushing out yelling that our food was right there.  I told her no, thank your, we've had quite enough and we walked out....no excuse.  Incidentally, the group of 3 arriving 30 minutes after is had finished their salads and received their food right after we walked out."}
{"text":"I wish I could give it 0. The restaurant is very old style. It smells like a nursing home. They do not take credit card so you better bring cash or a check. And you better bring a lot of money. My father got a steak, I got a steak and my sister got the soup and the total was 75$ It is true the portions are huge, but our steaks were fatty. Also I asked for medium and my father median-well and it came out medium rare. Very pink and bloody. Two thumbs DOWN"}
{"text":"If you are looking for good German cuisine you need to try this place.  Don't be fooled by the d√©cor which has not been updated.  To spite that the food is very good.  We love the homemade noodles and the pork schnitzel are very authentic!  We have eaten here three times and never disappointed!  The staff is friendly and always remembers us too!"}
{"text":"Went to Henry's today new ceiling tiles and carpet, the food was  awesome as I remembered"}
{"text":"Very old school feeling restaurant. The food was mediocre but the portions were big. Our server was nice. 

They don't take credit cards, we had to run to the bank and get cash. Paid $80 for 2 of us and left $20 for tips. For $100 in total, I probably wouldn't go there again but overall it was an ok experience."}
{"text":"Great Prime Rib..really good.
Restaurant is a Real Retro dinner club.
Expect a good Martini or Manhatten, the old fashion good way."}
{"text":"My first impression as I walked in the door is that some one hasn't re-decorated this place in a very long time...but it was clean and comfortable. We were seated right away. The server was attentive and did a great job. My dinner date ordered the liver and onions. It arrived hanging over the plate. One piece was cooked to his liking and the other was way undercooked. He took it home to have as a dinner meal. No problem. I orderd the bratwurst. It came with 2 brats, a large portion of sauerkraut and hot german potato salad. I took half of it home for my meal the next day. The server kept the coffee and water filled. She asked if we wanted any desserts-who had room for a dessert!!! Would i be back again? ABSOLUTELY!!!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to visit this restaurant again! I had eaten there quite awhile ago and remembered the atmosphere..the food.. the service..and the overall ambience. What I found now is a sad looking place..when we first entered we saw that is was dark, dank, and very DIRTY looking...when seated by the window you sit at a table with Vinyl tableclothes..and paint peeling from the windowsills...we decided to order(although my intial reaction is to RUN) I ordered the steak(porterhouse) and hubby ordered Prime Rib both Medium..after 45 minutes of waiting and a basket of Cold ,stale, rolls we received our dinners..My steak was RAW..and COLD...took another 10 min to catch the waitresses attention( we and another party were the ONLY customers in the place) asked for it to be refired to what I had specified when I ordered it.  Took ANOTHER 30 minutes to get my steak returned to me..in the meantime hubby and eaten..was done! The steak at that time was hot and tasty but had to get it to go!!! When our waitress \"wrapped\" it for us. she literally WRAPPED it in plastic..and put it in a USED Giant Eagle plastic bag!!! I was soooo disappointed in this expirience!!! THEY CLEARLY NEED GORDON RAMSEY IN THERE to clean it..decorate it..and show them what customers expect! I would NEVER go there again unless I see the place under NEW ownership..and renovated and CLEAN!"}
{"text":"I can honestly say that this is the best German restaurant I've ever been to. Every time me and my girlfriend are in Kent we can't not stop at Henry Wahner's for a meal. Great food and reasonable prices makes this place an excellent choice!"}
{"text":"I wouldn't recommend unless you have money to spend without caring how much you want to pay! The food was good but it was very expensive and when I got my sides I almost laughed at he waitress... My salad came in a small cup.... I understand it's all about the meat but I want my side salad like a normal size one.. And same thing with my fries.. There was literally like 8 fires!!!! I couldn't believe it! The meat was good but for the price I wouldn't have went there in the first place."}
{"text":"Good food... lots of fruit flies in the dining room lol
It was a battle of wills!

Seriously folks... swatting armies of fruit flies at our table throughout dinner was less than impressive.

And I was afraid to ask why it took 15 minutes to bring two beers... Folks are making them in the back lol"}
{"text":"Great German restaurant with good service.   Huge portions and plenty of gluten free options.   I had the combo plate and had to box up half of it.  A great selection of deserts that you can take home ( because you will be too full from dinner) They are cash only so make sure you hit the ATM before coming in."}
{"text":"The portions are Hugh! My grandson said he felt like Fred Flintstone when they brought out his ribs jokingly calling them the Tyrannosaurus  Rex he couldn't finish them they were delicious! I had Prime rib and I swear it was over 2 pounds, took it home as well. It is pricey but worth it, unless you don't like leftovers."}
{"text":"Meat sweats.  Yup, that pretty much says it all.

My favorites... smoked pork chops, schnitzel and then the porter house.  Have not managed to get to the Prime Rib just yet.

All of the meals come with enough food for you to take some home.  Sides are pretty good as well.  Especially the potato salad and or spetzil.  

They have fantastic deserts as well, so save space.

Good German beers.  

Only real down sides are if you go in the weekend, you may wait for a long time.  No reservations.  So they may run out of Prime Rib."}
{"text":"I just love this place. Best kept secret in Northeast Ohio.i walked in a noticed two men getting their prime rib. My god what a portion. I decided to stay away from that big of a meal and ordered the T-Bone. Well when the waitress came with my meal I was shocked to see the biggest piece of meat I have ever ordered. Along with it I ordered the hot cheese potatoes. This meal was Gigantic. I have no problem ordering a steak at that cost especially if it lasts me two days.  The steak was superb. So tender and flavorful.  I highly recommend this restaurant. Also my waitress was superb. Not once did my wife or I needed anything as our waitress was so attentive."}
{"text":"I've been to Germany a few times, and this reminded me of the restaurants that were in the basements of the local hotels I would stay at, except here they speak English!  The staff was friendly, service was fast, and food came out hot and fresh.  We were also there at 7pm and were the last ones to leave, so don't expect a Haufbrau House size crowd.  Good selection of German draught beers, complete with the heavy glass mug.  I had the Warsteiner Dunkel and homemade sausage, and it tasted just as good as HH or any of the other local places near Munich.  Kids didn't have a huge selection but they really liked the spaetzle.  Portion sizes were large and they boxed up a lot of food for us to take home.  Would recommend if you like German food!"}
{"text":"Cash or check.  They do not take credit cards.  Food is great.  Recommended for \"meat and potato\" crowd."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the outside of this place! The portions are large and the staff is super friendly! Only accepts cash! Also has a great list for German beers! Great for your meat & potatoes kind of nights!"}
{"text":"Wish I could write a review on this place.  But we ventured out on a Saturday night with 6 people and found the place closed ... too bad none of the restaurant info included the fact that they are only open Tuesday - Friday.  Closed on Saturday & Sunday!  Oh well guess we'll have to try it again some day"}
{"text":"First off everything stated in the previous Yelp reviews is true!  Here is my take. 

What you see is not even close to what it is. Dining area reminds me of a 1970s vintage family restaurant. So much so that I would have left except it was VERY busy. A full house of locals is a good sign to stick it out. 

Food here seems split between your German Grandma for dinner and a Middle Ages meat fest. Tonight we had German. But we seen good looking steaks the size of chuck roast pouring out of the kitchen. Definitely a local favorite. 

The wife's Schnitzel was huge. My Rouladen  was big also. Both of us liked the large amount of yummy Spatzel that came with it. It did not take long to see why they were busy. Food was like nothing we have had anywhere else (at least not East of Atlantic Ocean). 

Looking for something you haven't had?  Here is you chance."}
{"text":"The plus: huge, delicious steaks. Lots of other German-style cuisine on the menu, but the steaks are the signature menu item.

The negative: no free refills on soft drinks, and they don't accept credit/debit cards (but they will accept checks).

Staff is friendly. Decor is from the 70's. It gets pretty packed in here and they do run out of Prime Rib, which is the signature steak here."}
{"text":"We were hesitant about coming here based on some reviews on here. There were five of us in the party and we all ordered different meals. Everyone had very good food and we all had leftovers. The service was very good and various our requests were taken care of with no complaints or frowns from the servers. She brought extra bread, barbecue sauce, steak sauce and was very pleasant every time we stopped her to ask for something else or ask questions."}
{"text":"Love this cozy little spot. Great food and quiet atmosphere. Great family restaurant."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here for dinner last Saturday evening after a shopping excursion in Kent.  We hadn't eaten all day so we were HUNGRY!  The building appears to be an old \"Dutch Pantry\" replete with a barn shaped wooden sign and horseshoe parking lot.  (I have no idea how I channeled Dutch Pantry but it may have something to do with the fact that I'm 50 years old.)

The main entry to the restaurant accesses the bar... a \"too well lit\" bar for my tastes (I like dimly lit, covert drinking spots that encourage heart-to-heart conversations and dreamy memories).  All of the waitstaff was busy but seemed happy to be there.

We were seated in what I would call the middle dining room, where the waitstaff runs back and forth from the kitchen to the main dining room.  We would have preferred a more romantic setting but the entire restaurant is bathed in the \"cafeteria/hospital\" style lighting...

My husband and I ordered Spaetzels with gravy, Smoked Oysters, and Herring in a sour cream sauce for appetizers along with Merlot for me and a Dortmunder for my hubby.  Our waitress, Diane, gave me helpful wine advice.  

The apps were delicious!  We even ordered extra Spaetzels with our dinners!

I should note that the steaks here literally hang over the plates... I mean we made comparisons to Fred Flintstone going to the drive-thru diner and the rack of ribs tipping over his car.  We were trying to look over at a fellow diner's giant steak without seeming rude when his wife pleasantly said, \"You can turn around and look if you want!\"  By the end of the night other diners entering the restaurant were gawking at our prime ribs.

I should mention here that Henry Wahner's does not accept credit cards.  We knew this ahead of time so there was no problem.

Our dinners consisted of salads, mashed potatoes/gravy, spaetzels, and giant prime rib cuts (bone intact).  Wow!  Everything was delicious!!  Of course we took our leftover steaks home with us (the prime rib resulted in lunch and dinner sandwiches for my husband).  

We did purchase a lemon-blueberry cake with a cream cheese filling to take home (part -breakfast/part-lunch fare later in the week).

Overall the restaurant is top-notch, the prices are very reasonable for the quality/abundance of food one receives, the waitstaff is  awesome (thumbs-up to Diane), and the fellow patrons are extremely friendly (it seems like a lot of regulars eat here!)  The decor and atmosphere leaves much to be desired.  The bill may not reflect the dining atmosphere.

We would recommend this restaurant to friends and will DEFINITELY return!"}
{"text":"I went at the suggestion of a client.  I was skeptical as a foodie so I took a look at the reviews and decided to go for it.  I think the deciding factor was Susie T. 1 star review for not being open when she went.  That is terrible and hurts everyone that relies on this site.  I can say that the prime rib is large and excellent.  I prefer it to be served with Aujus and horseradish but when i asked it was brought promptly.  My fiance had the Deutsch Platte.  I found this to be very good.  I'm sort of a German connoisseur.  It was not the best german I've had by any means but ranked very well.  My fiancee agreed.  Dessert i had the German chocolate  cake, and she had the blueberry lemon cake-(I think)  Loved them both.  Desserts were different but more like 4 stars.  We will be back.  And shame on people who give 1 star for not being open.  You should be removed from this site.  I love how you said \"wish I could write a review on this place\"  even though you haven't written any other reviews.  If you want huge portions for a reasonable fee.  Go there.  I'll take the credit for your happiness."}
{"text":"Don't come here in the summer. Don't do it. Listen to me: DON'T. The combined heat of a cramped and crowded restaurant without air plus meat sweats is not something you want to experience. 

Plus, be prepared to wait but be adequately hungry enough for the massive portions. 

Henry Wahner's is quite an experience. It's like sitting at a friend's grandma's house. Not your grandma, no, it's not quite cozy enough. There's distance to how comfortable you'll feel here, starting with the mess that is parking atop the hill. 

My boyfriend ordered a 30 dollar steak and mozzarella sticks to start. Hilariously, we were told the mozzarella sticks were served with marinara, but instead we received shrimp cocktail sauce. All nine in our party asked what the deal with that was and we received the answer that the sauce WAS marinara. Uh. Ok. 

Anyway, while my boyfriend took some of his steak home, our friend tested the limits of his stomach and ate his entire steak. The next morning he notified us that he could barely move and had gained nine pounds from the previous day's weigh in. 

We still had some dessert and the apple strudel a la mode was most definitely delicious. 

Plan your visit strategically and you'll have a much easier and more enjoyable time here."}
{"text":"I would advise anyone wishing to dine at Henry Wahner's in Kent, Ohio to turn back now!  Yes, it is that bad.  Yes, it is that disgusting, and quite frankly, YES it is absolutely positively unwelcoming, dated, and DIRTY!  Upon pulling up to the restaurant, I was rather perturbed by the state of the exterior...it was filthy, the paint was peeling, the dumpsters were located in plain view right in the front of the building, and the sign was illegible with their phone number written in nothing other then a classy red sharpie.  Wanting to run FAR away from the place at first glance, myself and my friend decided to go forth anyways since it came highly recommended by a mutual friend.  Upon walking in the front door, there was a lady watering plants with a water pitcher, barefoot with a shirt that did not properly cover her enlarged navel area.  As we entered, we were informed that cards were not accepted.  Hello!  It's the twenty-first century, get with the program!  Anyways, we sat down and were tended to by two VERY unfriendly waitresses.  When I asked to make a substitution for a side dish on the German Sausage meal, I was informed that I could, but it would incur a $3.00 charge.  What didn't make sense was that it came with German Potato salad, which was clearly listed on the menu with all of the other sides at the same price of $3.00, but for some reason unbeknownst to mankind, substitutions were not allowed.  

To make things worse, I ordered the kleine Schnitzel only because it came with spatzle (a side that I liked).  When ordering, I had the option of a salad.  I chose pasta salad, thinking that I would be getting some elaborate German inspired pasta salad...only to receive a meager serving of Italian-style pasta salad in a small ramekin.  Now, at this point, I didn't think things could get much worse.  Boy, was I wrong.  

Five minutes after ordering our Kleine Schnitzel with Spatzle arrived.  Not only was it served promptly, but it looked like something you would get at a KC Cafeteria.  It was piled on a small plate and covered in a disgusting gravy that tasted like 2 parts bacon fat and 3 parts black pepper.  It was terrible!  I tried to force myself to eat it since it came to over ten dollars, but in the end I could not finish.  It really was that bad.  In fact, it was so bad, I complained to my friend the whole time just how bad it was and she couldn't even finish two thirds of the meal!  We love German food and drove FIFTY MILES to get it.  I wish I could get those fifty miles back.  

This was without a doubt the worst dining experience of my life!  If you want subpar food served by rude waitresses in a stale environment, go to Henry Wahner's.  Furthermore, if you want to go feel like you stepped back in a time warp, go here.  The service, food, cleanliness, and everything about this place was just terrible.  I actually felt unwelcome there.  I can't even explain in words just how bad it was.  This was what one would call a DIVE.  I should bill Henry Wahner's for all of the ibuprofen and antacids I had to take as a result of eating their \"food.\"  I am literally still in shock of how TERRIBLE this sad case of an establishment was.

In fact, this place was so terrible, I would not be surprised if the positive remarks were made by the owners.  Please save yourself and do not go to Henry Wahner's!"}
{"text":"We went there tonight looking forward to a good German meal. We got that. I ordered the Combination Platter. The portion was huge and everything was awesome except for the goulash. The gravy was very good, but the meat was very tough & chewy. I couldn't even eat it. The salad was not impressive at all, but it wasn't even necessary with a German meal. The Schnitzel was flavorful & the sausage had a great flavor. The service was very slow & we waited longer than we should have to get our order taken & to receive our bill. Our waitress seemed like she was just going through the motions. I will return to try other dishes. Overall, a good experience & definitely worth another visit."}
{"text":"Awesome food.  Huge steaks!  Got the German platter, really good."}
{"text":"It gets 1 star because the potato pancakes were just ok. We ordered the prime rib and talk about uneventful. For a $30 steak this was trash. Not sure what the hype is about but we will not be back. Sorry , just our opinion."}
{"text":"The best price for the quality and definitely the quantity. The decor is dated. But who cares when you get a great meal at a great price."}
{"text":"This is my \"go to\" spot when I'm craving a steak that's bigger than my face!  Pro-Tip:  If you are short on funds, from 4-6 pm Tues.-Fri they run an early bird special where select entrees like top sirloin and German fare are about half off normal price. 

The last time I went my friend and I were on time for the early bird and got two sirloins, potato side, side salad, and rolls for like 30 bucks.  It was crazy delicious and I had mad leftovers!

Henry Wahner's really is a hidden gem in Kent.  It is definitely old-school but who cares about the decor? I remember my family taking my grandma here like 15+ years ago and it hasn't changed one bit since then. Fortunately, neither has the quality of their food and service. 

Our servers were super nice, attentive, quick with the refills but not intrusive and the meal was nicely paced. Next time, I plan to get some of the German fare because I saw some schnitzel going to another table that looked Uh-Mazing!  Give their Jaeger potato side a try for some creamy, cheesy, jalapeno (just a tinge) goodness. 

As others have said - be sure you're packing some cash or your check book as they do not take cards.  (There is an ATM pretty much just across the street so don't panic if you happen to forget cash but still want some delicious meats.)  

The experience of being in Henry Wahners' would probably make a vegan cry, be nice to your veggie-friends and don't take them here. ;)"}
{"text":"I ordered the prime rib which was pretty good. My friend ordered the filet, and he found it decent as well. NOT the absolute best steakhouse I've ever been too. You're better off going to Outback where the prices are lower, and they take credit/debit cards! 

I really cannot stand the fact that they don't take credit/debit cards. It's 2012, people! The decor is BEYOND outdated. Very ugly/musty inside. 

I wouldn't go back solely based on the fact that they take cash and checks ONLY."}
{"text":"Biggest steaks ever and great German food. The porterhouse was at least 3 pounds and the t bone was at least two pounds."}
{"text":"We had a very nice experience at the restaurant. We arrived with a group of 8 and were sat right away. We had three get the prime rib and none were displeased! I had the Chicken Cordon Bleu and it was delicious. My husband had the fried shrimp and he was very pleased. We had a very picky 8 year old in our group, we asked the kitchen about chicken tenders, and were told they didn't have any but they would be willing to make some by chopping up a breast and breading it for her. When the meal came out she was very happy. 

I was surprised that I hadn't seen the Yager potatoes mentioned in any earlier reviews. They were the shining star in my opinion. The sides are a bit on the smaller size but I believe that is to leave room for your meat dishes which are all fairly large. 

Keeping me from giving it a 5th star would be the lack of poultry options, I'd like to have had a few more options despite liking the one I chose. And the price which was a bit steep in my opinion. 

The waitstaff was phenomenal, and Maria even allowed us to sing her happy birthday, as she was working hers while we celebrated with a member of our party. Thanks Maria, you were great!"}
{"text":"My wife and I tried it for the first time last night.  We will definitely be back.

I had the Deutsche Platte (combo plate), which has a sausage, schnitzel, and goulasch, with  spatzels and saucekraut.  My wife had the schnitzel with spatzel.  The only thing that wasn't great was the goulasch: it had a great taste, but the meat was a little chewy; not bad, but it could have been better.  But their schnitzel is terrific, nicely breaded, nicely seasoned.  The spatzels are great, just about perfect.

And you get a ton of food, neither of us could finish it.

We both tried their \"white French\" salad dressing - different and kind of thick, but I like it.

I had a beer, she had a Spanish coffee, and we split a very nice lemon-blueberry cake.

About $75 with the tip, not bad for all that you get.

The service was great and our waitress was very nice.

As others have noted, it is cash only, so come prepared.  And the place does look like something out of 1972, but it kind of goes with the old-fashioned hearty food.

If you are a vegan, or if you're looking for a light meal, this is not the place for you.  If you want old-fashioned traditional German food, you need to check it out."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I split a German combination platter and a shaved beef platter. It had more then enough food for the two of us.  We especially liked the beef tips and will be returning in the future.Our total bill with sodas was 41.72$."}
{"text":"Steaks as big as your head and decor straight out of your grandma's double wide.  The steaks are amazing but everything is charged separately and the don't take credit or debit cards. 

Honestly, the decor is really a turn off. It's like eating in a dank basement rec room in 1980."}
{"text":"We enjoy their Friday night early bird specials...we have had several of them and alwAys enjoy them."}
{"text":"Come hungry!  This place is VERY GOOD, especially the German fair. Huge portions, comfy but very old school decor."}
{"text":"i so disliked this place.  it hasn't been cleaned or updated since the 70's.  the salad was iceberg in a tiny bowl.  i almost cracked up laughing.  i was just disgusted with the meal, i actually brought it home for my husband without eating anything (he will eat anything).  the rolls were from a pack like my grandma served at thanksgiving.  a very bad step back into a time warp."}
{"text":"Biggest Steaks in Ohio!! The prime rib at this place is insane, its so big it don't even fit on the plate. They also have pretty good German food. Dont expect anything fancy inside but worth the visit."}
{"text":"Wesley S. is not joking around when he says \"Biggest Steaks in Ohio!!\". My friend Tuni would always get the prime rib. It would not fit on the plate. I have never had the German food. I am Polish and can't really... well I can forgive, but I can't forget. I don't enjoy German food. This was my go to place if I could ever scrounge up enough change or sell some DVD movies or compact discs for money when I was broke. My graduation dinner was held here. Back in 2005, they only accepted cash. I don't know if that is still the case but be ready for that."}
{"text":"After living in the area for 10+ years, I finally made it over to Henry Wahner's and ABSOLUTELY loved it!!!

Hubby and I went at opening.  We walked in and there is a bar/lounge area to the right.  To the left is the sit down restaurant.  The waitress asked how many and let us pick where we wanted to sit.  I LOVE choosing my seat!  I'm more comfortable that way!  Our waitress was kind and patient.  She happily explained questionable items on the menu and when asked, even gave us her recommendations.  As an appetizer we tried their sauerkraut balls.  OMG!  I've never tasted homemade and it was delicious!!!!  Even hubby, who hates sauerkraut ate them!!!

I then ordered the Deutsche Platte, also known as their German Combination Platter.  I wanted to try everything and this was the best way to do it.  It is a combination plate with sausage, goulash, schnitzel, spatzels and saucekraut. I fell in love!  The beef of the Goulash was extremely tender and just enough spice to heat you from the inside.  The Schnitzel is my favorite.  I ate all of that!  The platter is SO HUGE that I took 75% home and had 2 more meals from it!

Hubby had the T-Bone steak.  All of the other reviewers were not kidding about the size.  IF YOU WANT A STEAK THE SIZE OF YOUR FACE, THIS IS WHERE YOU GO!!!  Hubby ordered it medium and they go it done right the first go round.  He even said it tasted beautiful!  

The German Chocolate cake looked yummy and hubby ate it all, but I had to have the Creme Schnitten.  WORTH IT!  All together the check was $64 and some change but it was worth every penny!

WE ARE GOING BACK!!!"}
{"text":"This is an OK place, but it's German more in theory than practice.

The entrance is by the bar. I walked inside and looked around, seeing no one (around 5:45 on a weeknight). Finally I spotted someone who looked like a waitress moving around some tables down the hall. When I told her I wanted dinner, she said something like \"Ruth will take care of you\" and turned back to her empty tables. Of course, I had no idea who Ruth (or whatever the name) was. But I wandered down the hall and into the dining room, where the first woman had disappeared. A faint sound of conversation led me around another corner to an unattended hostess stand. Eventually someone noticed me and led me to a table.

The inner dining room was fairly busy for a weeknight (helped along, no doubt, by the early bird specials). So busy that I had to wait at least 10 minutes for my decaf coffee. (A word about the early birds: Though it doesn't say so on the menu, they're not just cheaper than regular dining hours; they're half-size portions at two-thirds the price, at least for the goulash.)

So I went for the full-portion goulash, with a bean salad side. DO NOT pick the bean salad side. It was bland, and such a small portion that I can only assume the house salad I could have chosen instead must be just one leaf of lettuce.

The \"goulash\" came with spaetzle and sauerkraut. I had considered asking for red cabbage instead, but I'm glad I didn't. The kraut was great -- a little spicy but not too vinegary. The main part of the plate was something I wouldn't call authentic goulash (and I've had that in Hungary and Austria). Pretty bland gravy. However, the beef was tender and there was a lot of it -- enough for a full second meal the next day.

It took so long to get a waitress' attention when I was done that I skipped dessert; the choices on the menu didn't look too exciting. 

It's not a place I would return to again and again, but it's not bad and probably a good place to take your grandma."}
{"text":"Best steaks you will ever eat. but bring cash."}
{"text":"My first visit was fantastic Anne the owner and bar staff was so warm and well coming
Maria was our cute waitress, she was so helpful and on the case all night. Our food was one of the best meals I have eaten here in the USA. There is something to be said about a mom & pops Restersnt. Be sure to book your table ahead of time and you will be expected to pay with cash or check as paying with Credit Card costs the Restersnt extra money that they do not have to pass onto the customer. So I was very excited to see the bill, it was a lot lower than I expected."}
{"text":"Ordered the bratwurst platter and my date had the homemade sausage platter. We both liked the bratwurst more but overall amazing meal with great bread, tons of sauerkraut, and German mustard. My margarita was very strong and date ordered an entire Liter of German beer!!

Awesome food, laid back atmosphere, decent services, and it's a quiet relaxed place, a good getaway from the other crazy restaurants overrun by students in the area. 

PS They only take cash."}
