{"text":"Spectacular! My new favorite! The opening of this restaurant is truly the comeback of Lake Las Vegas and the Montelago Village. There is no better place to enjoy a meal than on the gorgeous waterfront patio of this cute European bistro. Incredible food, the prices are reasonable, and of course, only the best vino.  I tried the roasted chicken... seasoned and cooked to *perfection*. The complementary flavors and herbs in this dish were outstanding. Garnished with rosemary and paired with garlic mashed potatoes and sautéed spinach, this was by far THE best meal I've had in months.   Service standards are bar none. Glasses will never go empty here! I am truly impressed by the fluidity of the dining experience, especially for this being their third day of business.   The improvements they have made to this location are impeccable. It feels so classy and brand new.  Cheers to the man behind it all. Alex, the owner, executed his vision for this restaurant brilliantly. He has perfected every detail, and it only gets better from here. I can't wait to see this place come to life in the summertime."}
{"text":"What a wonderful evening on their patio being tended to by a top notch wait staff. I had filet and hubby had a full fish that was professionally deboned right at our table. The mussels and cheese board to start were delish. We were told all the seafood comes in fresh that day, never frozen. The patio was clean and well tended. We looked inside and now I want to have a private party in their wine room. Excellent food and service. I'll definitely return and recommend."}
{"text":"This place is worth every star. I've been here many times and even hosted a three day event here. There entire staff was great to work with and went above and beyond to meet our needs. The food is excellent and view is spectacular. It's worth a drive to Lake Las Vegas to sit lake side and enjoy some food and drinks."}
{"text":"I feel like the yelp community lied on this one.  The view of Las Vegas Lake was great but the service was questioned at best.  I waited over an hour for my steak that was over cooked.  The fries served with the steak have almost no flavor.  The wine list is extensive so you can put that in the plus column.  The steak also has a decent flavor but I'm sure any armature with a grill and salt could mimic the taste.  Come for the wine list and the views but not dinner!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is the best thing that has ever happened to Lake Las Vegas! The beautiful outside dining room is so romantic and the view of the lake and stars and moonlight can't be beat. The food is fresh, flavorful and the best combination of French and Mediterranean flavors I've ever experienced in Nevada. There's nothing better than having a cheese plate and a bottle of wine and watching the boats go by... What's even better than the food and view is the service!! Alex is so warm and accommodating and hospitable, it's as if I'm coming home to visit family every time I come in! Well done Mimi and Coco!! Will definitely be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Best restaurant in Lake Las Vegas! So thrilled to have this new addition to the Village. Beautiful views of the lake and the bridge...very romantic at night. The cuisine is French with a Mediterranean/Italian flair. We have been several times.... the Salmon Penne in a vodka sauce it the best I have ever had.. also a must... the Octopus appetizer.. succulent flavors. But the Grilled Branzio (European Sea Bass) served table side is my favorite dish... very light and delicate... Très bon!!!"}
{"text":"This is first class restaurant with a real European feel. Food was excellent and the staff... exceptional!"}
{"text":"Great food!!! Service is always good!!! Such an amazing variety!!! Always have a wonderful time dining here!!!!  8/12/17---was just there --again--last night!!! You have to go there to appreciate what I am saying---service, people, the beautiful view of the lake!! Inside or outside never a bad seat the house. Food is always great!! Italian beer, champagne!! Awesome!!!"}
{"text":"This place is just incredible. A mix of French and Italian. Great service. The bus boy refilled my water so many times, he likely is unaware of the water shortage here in Las Vegas.My wife and I shared, Steak Tartare, Salade Nicoise, loaded with delicious anchovies, calamari done to perfection.The special sea bass that my wife had was boned and filleted table side to perfection.Even the side of potatoes were incredible We shared a creme brulee that should be illegal it was that good.There is an extensive outdoor patio over looking the lake, should be wonderful, as the warmer weather is about to take over. A real winner. About time for fine quality dining at Lake Las Vegas.  The assortment of wines is quite impressive.Out table was situated in the wine room and it added to the stellar ambiance."}
{"text":"Jeudi 23 nov. 2017  Repas en couple a 16h. Bon restaurant, service soigne et rapide, très bon vin meme en verre. Attention aux prix, mes spaghettis sur une moitié de langoustine, surprenant mais bon, 42 dollars . . . Pour le reste romantique à souhaits. La vue sur le lac."}
{"text":"Amazing dinner and first rate hospitality. Our server \"Alex\" made us feel welcome and like family as soon as we walked through the door. The wine list is surprising diverse and the menu is a classic representation of an authentic French Bistro! We cant wait to come back. Thank you for your excellent service and we look forward to our next visit! Santé"}
{"text":"I ordered the salmon salad and the spinach dressing was very salty, a few bites was enough. My girlfriend's pasta dish was plain. This was a disappointing evening out."}
{"text":"Food is excellent here. Great French Bistro. Reminded me of Europe.  Steak sandwich was great and above average. Salad was really fresh. Service was good. Perfect lunch spot overlooking the lake on patio"}
{"text":"We came here for our anniversary and the staff made it very special! Michaelangelo was our server and he was very attentive and courteous. The service, food, and scenery made it such a perfect night!!"}
{"text":"What an amazing experience! I was visiting a friend in Las Vegas when we decided to celebrate his mothers 81st birthday by taking her to dinner at Mimi' & Coco' Bistro. To start off, the restaurant architecture and waterfront location are stunning, however, the real treat was the unbelievable attentive staff and wonderful food. My friends mother was overwhelmed by the attention given her by the staff, even when extremely busy, they took time to sing \"Happy Birthday\" and pose for a picture while she blew out her candles. From the crisp Caesar salad, to the \"melt in your mouth\" steaks, our evening at Mimi' & Coco' Bistro was an evening the three of us will not forget!"}
{"text":"Amazing service. Amazing food. Anyone who put a bad review shouldn't be going to a place where they can't make their own food. Charcuterie board was fantastic. French fries were great. Espresso was smooth and awesome. 5 stars definitely coming back."}
{"text":"This is such a nice restaurant with an amazing view of the beautiful lake. The service was excellent and the food was fantastic. They make their own pasta from scratch!"}
{"text":"Came to this place with my family, I had the charcuterie and my daughter had the grilled salmon.  awesome food and good costumer service. Shout out to Ivan and Sydney, they're awesome!"}
{"text":"Wonderful place, Very tasty food. We went here for the first time to celebrate the boss's birthday. Great service as well. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We ate here twice; Saturday and Sunday both around 3 pm.  When we came Saturday restaurant was pretty much empty. We sat right away. Food was good and service was prompt. We liked everything expect tall and creepy old Persian guy with super short pants staring us so much, it almost made my date feel uncomfortable. Total bill was around $40! We did tip them %20..  So Sunday we went back and ordered exactly same things like last time. But for some reason they acted like they did not recognize us from yesterday and made us fell unwelcome.    When the check came I noticed they charged $12 for the same item I paid $8 yesterday. I didn't feel like arguing with them. I just detected $4+tax from their tip..  It's just sad how greedy some people are.."}
{"text":"The food we ordered were everything tasty! I ordered grilled fish, my boyfriend ordered grilled shrimp.  The server was very friendly and nice, the view from the restaurant was nice too.  We love it and we will come back here again."}
{"text":"Twice we came for family luncheon and twice impressed. Classic European service with tablecloth etc. French onion soup excellent everyone happy."}
{"text":"We had the cutest dinner on the patio of Mimi & Coco Bistro!  Try to get seated at a table that faces the water and is at the front. Because it was nighttime, there were string lights up and the ambiance was so romantic.  Unfortunately there was a rather loud country and rock concert (I know, it was a cover band on a Saturday night at the lake) going on off to the left, so that affected the ambiance a little bit, but it wasn't too much of a deterrent. Some live jazz would have been perfect.  The food was delicious:  -Mussels -Filet Mignon -Mashed Potatoes -French Fries  The service was good and I'm looking forward to going back next time with different music!"}
{"text":"Great service, but the food is bland and will never go back, sad, since this is such a nice setting."}
{"text":"The food was not prepared as ordered, and the staff is pretend nice: the two things that make me want to leave a bad review for a restaurant hoping they'd read this and make some fundamental changes in their core values. We asked for medium well lamb chops served fresh and they came cold, and medium raw. And the chicken was also not freshly cooked. The staff's leaf blower blew dust all over us and the guy ran inside the minute I went like WTF!! Not recommended at all."}
{"text":"Wow. Amazing. I love this place. So glad we found it to celebrate our wedding anniversary. The staff was exceptional, the food was AMAZING, the white clam chowder soup bread bowl was out of this world, loved the shrimp scampi and New York steak too. Everything was delicious. But the view of the lake, atmosphere, live music, lights, and service was truly unlike anything. It was so beautiful."}
{"text":"The food was ok. Here for a conference. I asked for lamb chops medium and came out well done. Service and wine was good though!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, fantastic wine selection, great music played at an appropriate volume, and the worlds greatest bartender, Vito.  I highly recommend visiting this place and absorbing as much knowledge as you can out of Vito; the man is world travelled and definitely knows his food and wine.  This place takes great pride in the quality of its food  and employees and it shows!  10/10."}
{"text":"Drove to  Lake Las Vegas for a quick brunch getaway & found this place. Great atmosphere, friendly and very attentive staffs...there were 4 different people rotating making sure everything was perfect. Food was good and their sangria was delish! Will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"The head waiter pulled a fast one on the bill. I was in town for the Consumer Electronics Show. I was alone for my last dinner and craved a salad + steak meal. My order was a Caesar Salad, entree and two glasses of wine. When the bill came it was for $200. $200?!? For one person?!? We didn't pay HALF that for TWO people at a nearby fancy restaurant in the same area (Henderson) last night. What's the deal?  When I asked him 'to help me understand' the $200 bill, he said the Ribeye special was $140 alone. I looked at the menu and saw steak+lobster as the most expensive entree at $60 total. How could the special cost $80 more than the most expensive entree??????   When I clarified' my bill twice with him, he took off $20 then $20 more; still $140 total in Henderson.   I paid the bill including a tiny tip and left. To be balanced, the service was very attentive and the food tasted great. But .... I still left with a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"Let's just start off by saying that this place is beautiful.  Then again, any place next to Lake Las Vegas and in Montelago Village would get this atmosphere boost.  The patio, where we were seated was adorned with fire pits, fire columns, and strung with lights.  In our spring time weather, it was perfect.   The service was on point and the waiter was knowledgeable although I wish he knew a bit more about wine and what would pair best with what we got.  That being said, his recommendations worked since I'm not a wine snob lol.  Speaking of food, I got one of their specials, the pork shank osso bucco with pappardelle pasta.  While this wasn't the best osso busso or even pork osso busso I have had, there was definitely nothing wrong with it.  It was incredibly tender and fell off the bone immediately upon my fork touching it.  The sauce was good and simple and the noodles were a nice accompaniment.  My date got the salmon which she said was very good.   I really enjoyed my time here and would definitely go back again.  I will say though that the prices are a bit high.  I wanted to get a salad or appetizer but once I saw the prices I decided I had better not.  I'm not saying it's not worth it, I'm just saying I think the location and scenery jack the prices up a bit."}
{"text":"This is dessert at Mimi and Coco Bistro at Lake Las Vegas. Dinner was fabulous and the setting beautiful. Our server, Michaelangelo, was perfect. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Great food and drinks ! We love the view of the lake for sure some Romantic dinner we had !"}
{"text":"One of the BEST places to be, eat, drink & socialize!! The bar is loaded, wine is great,  but the food & service is Phenomenal!! If you get a chance you've got to get out & try it"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem!!! My fiance and I went there for dinner tonight. As a New York Italian (fiance is a San Francisco Italian) we are both pretty well versed in good food and good service. This place is fantastic. The staff was super friendly and extremely attentive to the diners. We both had the halibut with shrimp and spinach. As a seafood lover, the halibut was awesome and the shrimp were literally the best I have ever had...tasted more like lobster. Desert of chocolate mousse was excellent as well. Every single person that worked there from bartender to waiter to owner were super friendly and made the dining experience great. We are in town for one more night and will be going back tomorrow to try the chicken francaise!!!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant! I have lunched, dined and wined at Mimi & Coco many times. The service from ALL staff is impeccable. The food is amazing!! We recently had a work event on the patio and we had the best time ever. The whole venue is the perfect place for any events!  The view of Lake Las Vegas and the sun setting behind the bridge is breathtaking!"}
{"text":"Came here for Mothers Day and was pleasantly surprised! We ended up ordering almost every appetizer & only one entree because the entrees just didn't seem all that great, however as we were getting ready to leave - we saw guests being served options that were definitely not on the menu. Turns out we were never read the specials! & that is the only reason I can't give this place 5 starts, the staff seemed easily overwhelmed and a bit confused at times; I believe we were served someone else's food three times and every time they went to refill our glasses, they never returned with them!"}
{"text":"Service was outstanding. The special of the day was the tuna with tomato caper and olives in a delicious sauce. It was very good. The side of asparagus was very good as well. The tuna was thick and the exterior was a little dry but the interior part of the fish was delicious. Extra sauce. My friend had the salmon but we preferred the tuna. It has a lakeside view which is spectacular with the mountains in the background. Would recommend this place. Also recommend to request a seat outside."}
{"text":"Great food great people great experience. A little charm a little style authentic Southern European food right on Lake Las Vegas."}
{"text":"This place has a beautiful atmosphere. Drinks and appetizers are good. Menu is small but to be expected for a place like this- Bistro. Outdoor seating is great, right on the water. Pricing is a bit high but if you want to splurge on a quiet night out with an upscale like atmosphere, this is a place to consider. The staff is friendly. The drinks were great. And the cheese platter was delicious. Wine menu- they have it! The only thing is I would consider the music. Maybe change it to match the wonderful ambience."}
{"text":"My wife and I truly enjoyed our visit...The food was great, service exceptional, great ambience and a fantastic location over looking Lake Las Vegas. The owner Alex, our server Mykel,  the bartender Claudia could not be more hospitable.  Looking forward to going back soon ."}
{"text":"Best Italian food I had in a while. BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE. LOVE THE OWNER, love the food, love everything. I highly recommend this place. My family loves it, my friend loves it. Everyone loves it. Best experience i had in a long time!!"}
{"text":"Beautiful location with an amazing patio, great food and crear customer service.  We went to this location on Easter Day and even if it was busy they still provided an amazing customer service and pleasurable experience.  We will definitely be back and will also recommend it ."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Nice staff.  Henderson is an early town but this place stayed open later than everything else.  Thanks!!!"}
{"text":"Really good food, loved the atmosphere/design of the interior. Dover Sole was great as were the steak frites. Tried the escargot which were solid. Caesar salad was phenomenal, as was the bread. Waiter was a cool guy, and the service was speedy. Would definitely come back next time we are in LLV"}
{"text":"First of all i was Excited to eat here because its was well presented.  Once i walked inn i sat next to my sister who was at the bar.  The bartender/ server saw me and didn't acknowledge me at all. Finally after 5 mins she says (need a menu? ) Im like okay maybe the server sucks but the the food maybe great.  WRONG i ordered to go what a mess nothing special the server put no napkins nothing no utensils i was so disappointed  + she was slow and i tipped her. The food was A-ok. I do come to Henderson ONCE a year every year and i will Never ever go there again.  So for that i give 3 stars because i don't blame the owner i blame the employee and maybe what i order wasn't the best even though (server said it was the most popular). I'll be nice enough not to put her name because i still have the receipt  but the boy servers were amazing credit to them!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing late lunch at Mimi' Coco' Bistro. Service 10 out of 10. Food 11 out of 10. Seafood casserole was delicious. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Outstanding restaurant! From the moment you walk through the door, the customer service is excellent. Every single part of your experience at the restaurant shows a conscientious effort by the entire staff and owner to make your meal a wonderful and memorable experience. I went here on my 41st birthday with my girlfriend and had a romantic evening. Could not have picked a better place!"}
{"text":"We were all pleasantly surprised to have had a lovely lunch here on Tuesday.  I'd imagine we just missed the spring break crowds, so it was nice and quiet! The seven of us arrived right when the restaurant opened and were the only customers there.  Sometimes when that happens service and food are not so good, but, not here! The service was excellent and the food was, too! Everything we ordered was well done...fresh and tasty. My relatives are from France and actually commented that the escargot was just as good, maybe even better than anything they had tasted in France! My husband was happy with his steak & frites and I enjoyed the Niçoise salad with a side of sautéed mushrooms. All three desserts were out of this world! My favorite was the Creme brûlée. It just melts in your mouth. The ice cream  puffs tied in second with the rich Chocolate mousse! We sat outside with the view of Lake Las Vegas which made me feel like I was in Europe somewhere by the sea! I gave it four stars for just a few reasons.  Unfortunately there's a slight sewage smell floating around outside that didn't seem to bother us once the wind picked up. Probably not their fault, maybe just a Lake Las Vegas issue. Second, the women's bathroom lacked a little changing table for our baby. Overall, I can't wait to return with more friends and family."}
{"text":"Was very disappointed with the food here! After reading the reviews I was excited to dine here! We ordered the rack of lamb and the risotto and sorry to say they were both horrible! The lamb had no flavor and the risotto was by far the worst I have ever had!!!! The risotto actually came out like a soup I couldn't believe it; it was watered down...Best thing about the place that I loved is the view dining outside..."}
{"text":"This place is unbelievably amazing! Owner personally came to greet us and asked if everything was alright.  The atmosphere is very romantic, a perfect place to bring your honey. I highly recommend eating here after and exciting day of fly boarding, paddle boarding, wake boarding, or hoverboarding at the nearby watersport experience shop."}
{"text":"I celebrated my birthday here for the first time and the view was sooo amazing! I'm originally from N.Y. and it was just a breath of fresh air to see the water again! The service was outstanding, they were extremely accommodating and attentive towards our needs. They even offered a complimentary anti pasto platter of different cheeses and deli meats they kids loved it. The only reason I did not give them 5 stars and I have to be honest, the food was not that great, it lacked flavor and did not taste as fresh as I'd like it to be. If they focused more on the quality of their food I would visit more often."}
{"text":"Our server was Luca and he was awesome. The food was Fantastic! We tried the soft shell crab as an appetizer. For my main course, I ate Mediterranian Sea Bass. It wasn't on their menu but it was on the specials for the day. Luca was above and beyond. Their Creme Brulee was the best! I would definitely eat here again. Plus the view was amazing!"}
{"text":"We went for a drive to lake Las Vegas and had dinner at mimì & Cocó. The food was excellent and the owners very kind and welcoming!"}
{"text":"Decided to dine here on New Years Eve. It was a busy night granted, but the service was one of the worst experiences I've had. Arrived early and had a drink at the bar. Bartender was nice and the only thing justifying the star is the considerate wine pours. As the rest of the party arrived, we informed the hostess, who then gave us attitude in return. Server was clueless of what came with each item. Didn't serve an item I ordered and then never apologized. Double charged us for an item. Lost our credit card... and here's the kicker. We asked for a picture of our party from one the servers and he says \" No I can't, I'm too busy\"... For the prices, I'd except better. Get it together!"}
{"text":"STAY AWAY FROM HERE! Worst service EVER and the worst thing is that it was provided by the OWNER imagine that. An arrogant guy with NO SENSE whatsoever about customer service.  The place is expensive enough to receive such kind of service, the guy acts as if he is doing you a favor instead of being quite the opposite.   We work for a local magazine who specializes in recommendations for people here in Vegas. Rest assure we will write about this and share it with colleagues at other local magazines."}
{"text":"Excellent mushroom pasta, octopus appetizer and steak sandwich on a beautiful lakefront day.  Our server, Michalangelo was friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"Had an amazing experience at Mimi and Coco! From the Octopus and Potato appetizer to the incredible Barramundi and side dishes everything exceeded our expectations. Probably the best restaurant in Lake Las Vegas! Service and lake view are unbelievable.  Congratulations to Allessandro, the owner, who hit it out of the park at this fabulous Lake Las Vegas new restaurant. Can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"Waterfront French style restaurant in Lake Las Vegas.  The restaurant is absolutely breathtaking with beautiful art and architecture on the inside and a gorgeous waterfront patio overlooking the lake.  We came for Sunday brunch. The actual brunch items are not on the menu and are very limited. The restaurant does have a full lunch menu.  On Saturday and Sunday it is bottomless mimosas from noon to 4pm for $20 a person. The orange juice is fresh squeezed and they give you your own bottle(s) of champagne at your table.  The waitstaff and manager were very nice and accommodating."}
{"text":"I took my elderly mother to this restaurant for lunch and she loves to kid around and the waiter was so rude to her not once but twice! He did not write down our order so forgot to bring my salad. When I told him his mistake he was so rude to me about his mistake? The Salmon cakes were hard and not edible to me. The only thing good about this experience was the Calamari and the lake! The waiter was arrogant and rude and I was always taught to respect my elders. The waiter was more interested in a couple that was friends of the owner than taking care of us. We will not return to this restaurant to be treated this way. I take my mother out to eat all the time she loves it and we never get treated like this!"}
{"text":"Took my girl here for our anniversary, and couldn't of had a nicer time! All of the staff was excellent and very friendly(Josh Metz the manager was great he kept checking on us to make sure we were good) my girlfriend loved the wine they recommended and my dirty martini was on point!  The best part of course was the food, we both ordered the filet mignon and lobster, and it was sooooo bomb, seasoned to perfection and the steak was so juicy we'll definitely be coming back. Not to mention such a romantic spot right on the shore of the lake, your girl won't be disappointed Boys!!"}
{"text":"Service: Claudia rocks. Super friendly and happy. Recommend her or her boyfriend as servers.  There are a few disgruntled Italian waiters. Steer clear, especially from an older one who is shorter. Curmudgeon.   Ambience: awesome, inside and out. Really unique inside, quite unexpected. Beautiful views.   Food: average? Nothing inspired. Fellow diner felt chicken sandwich and veggies were good. Calamari was light but a bit fishy with a heavy tartar sauce but a light panko. We both thought the fries were bland. A homemade dipping sauce would go miles. Niçoise salad was average. A variety of fresh veggies with what seemed to be big chunks of canned tuna. Some tlc to the tuna-olive oil, capers, salt, pepper-would do wonders. So would a different dressing, it was mostly white and tasteless? Profiteroles were not my thing, eggy tasty puffs with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce. Different ingredients (more complex chocolate sauce, richer/lighter ice cream) may have worked out better?   New place, in business 3 months. We'll return to see how they're doing. They really need to hire someone who knows sauces, dips, and dressings."}
{"text":"Mimi and Coco's is an amazing place. From the delicious French cuisine to the greatest lakeside view this one of the best places we have been in to Las Vegas yet. The staff was very knowledgeable when it came to choosing a wine for our main course. They let's us enjoy our time together while at the same time making us feel taken care of. We will definitely be back to this favorite."}
{"text":"The waiter suuuuuuuper hated his job and us, even dumping water on our table and then leaving without acknowledging it. Other than him, the food was great and the views can't be beat. I had salmon and veggies for lunch and my friend ordered a salad. Everything was very fresh and well prepared. If you find yourself at Lake Las Vegas, this is a perfect place to grab a bite and enjoy the scenery."}
{"text":"Alex the owner and Luciano were amazing hosts for the evening.   Top notch service sitting out on veranda.  Veal shank and sea bass were pricy but worth it.  I don't normally drop $200 for dinner, but it was first class all the way and I have zero regrets for an amazing experience.   Go enjoy with your date!"}
{"text":"She says: At first glance, Mimi' & Coco' Bistro (not sure why they need the apostrophes) is an adorable little restaurant on Lake Las Vegas. Upon entering the establishment, we were offered the choice of indoor seating or a table on their lakeside patio. The weather was too great to stay indoors, so we opted for a table by the waterfront.  He says: Location, location, location. Situated waterfront on Lake Las Vegas, I couldn't imagine a better spot in the area. Outdoor seating galore. Inside, nice rustic feel with lots of stone and brickwork.  She says: After being seated, we seem to have become invisible because no water or menus were offered. We enjoyed the view for a while before flagging down one of the many waiters who kept passing us back and forth. Menus materialized, water was poured, and another waiting period began. We again flagged down another waiter, who called upon yet a third waiter, who took our drink menus. We jumped at the chance to order an app, not knowing when someone might pay attention to us again. My Kir arrived, looking and tasting like a glass of white wine (see pic). The grilled octopus was a treat - cooked well, although a tad under charred. Though the menu states that it's accompanied by arugula salad and salsa verde, our octopus came with the above-stated salad and pan-fried potatoes.  He says: Had a reservation for 7pm. Got there about 10min early and were seated immediately. We were offered the option of inside or outside dining and chose the later. We were given 2 menus and then after waiting 10min, had to flag down a waiter to order our drinks. No drink menus were offered and there are none listed on the menu. I asked whether they carried Stella and was told they do. The waiter returned with a beer, explaining that they were out of Stella and I was told (while my beer was being poured) that they were giving me something similar. I didn't realize Stella was made in Mexico. We made the wise decision of ordering our appetizer (grilled octopus w/arugala) first and our entree 15 min later. The neighbouring table ended up with their entrees while still eating their apps. Octopus was slightly undercooked and the arugula could have used a little more dressing. Very average.  She says: I ordered the Dover Sole; when I asked what it came with, our waiter stated that he thought it comes with sautées spinach. He was wrong. It came with the same potatoes that accompanied the grilled octopus and some veg - two pieces of carrot, and a piece each of cauliflower and broccoli. The mixed veg were completely raw. Not al dente, but raw. At least they were hot. The fish, while cooked well, was completely devoid of any lemon flavor whatsoever ... given that it's one of the four ingredients of the dish, you'd think that you should be able to taste it.   He says: I went with my go-to bistro dish, steak frites, for my entree. Steak (10oz NY Strip) was cooked right, however, it was tasteless and tough. Fries were limp. Really poor execution of a pretty simple dish.  She says: We opted to share the chocolate mousse. The presentation was lovely, and the taste was good, but the dessert was covered in powdered cocoa, to the extent that I coughed every time I took a bite. Not a fan.  He says: The chocolate mousse dessert was on point, although they really need to lighten up on the cocoa powder. Very difficult to eat without coughing.  She says: Overall, the view was great, the outdoor patio was really enjoyable, the food was just ok, the wine was great (I could have done without having to serve it myself though), and the service sucked. 2 stars.  He says: Great location, average service, below average food. 2 stars."}
{"text":"If i could title this review it would be \"meh.\" My boyfriend and I came here for lunch and I was really excited since this is a spot i've been wanting to come for months.  When we arrived there were two other tables seated. We ordered the escargot which was absolutely horrible (mind you i've been eating this since I was 12). Secondly, I ordered a veggie sandwich, my boyfriend the steak sandwich, it took 30 min for our food to arrive... I asked if they were killing the cow! Prior to getting my sandwich I told them i was allergic to balsamic vinegar and to have a side of olive oil for my salad dressing.... they presented me with their balsamic dressing when my food came.. The waiters were nothing more then less than fair, he didn't even thank us when we gave him the credit card to our check.  However, the bus boy provided the best service and was very attentive. I will never come back again which is disappointing since i'll be moving to Lake Las Vegas shortly."}
{"text":"My wife and I just had an amazing dinner at Mimi and Coco's.  The service was excellent from the bartender Jarrod, the servers Gianni and Yuri and the manager Alexandra. I can't thank them enough for providing us with the best service we have had in the Las Vegas Valley in our 12 years here.  The food was equally amazing, I had the seared tuna special and my wife had house made seafood ravioli.  The staff also provided us with a few additional surprises to make the evening perfect.  We have a new favorite restaurant!"}
{"text":"If I can give a zero star I will do it. The Owner of the restaurant \"take care\" of us haha the Owner!!!!! And his service and attitude was the worst I ever seen in the whole world!!! So that is the example that you give to your employees???!!!!!! You do not deserve to own anything that has relation with customer service ever!!!! The restaurants that are on Lake Las Vegas do not deserve a restaurant that you own if is that the way that you are treating customers that I am sure you are!!!!!

{"text":"Had the chance to dine at this beautiful waterside eatery last night. My date choose the restaurant.  I knew nothing of the restaurant.  I was very pleasantly surprised.  From the decor to the scenery to the service to the food. EVERYTHING!  I wanted to order the lamb chops my my date wanted them too, so I choose the seafood casserole. (of course I knew my date would let me taste his chops).  The seafood was delicious,  Plump succulent shrimp, mussels, calamari, salmon, and so much more. The sauce was perfect.  Not too spicy at all.  The lamb chops were cooked to perfection, possibly the best I have ever had.  Oh, also we were surprised with a rare treat.  They had a mozzarella that they don't often have,  Served with buffalo tomato and basil. It was incredible.  I bit into it and closed my eyes, (you know how we do sometimes when food is sooo good) I thought I was in Florence.   Do yourself a favor and take the short drive to quiet Lake Las Vegas and have a wonderful meal at Mimi & CoCo's.  You won't be disappointed."}

{"text":"Very good place to grab lunch in front of the lake. Good salads and sandwiches plus amazing bread!! You will find great service too."}
{"text":"Scammed a large group of Reunion attendees. Brought out water, charged us $8 a bottle. Brought out wine we didn't order, $50 a bottle. Brought out appetizers we didn't order. There were about 15 of us. Everyone was being very careful about what they ordered as everyone was on a budget. The wine and appetizers came out and no one thought to ask who ordered them, because no one did. We thought they were part of the dinner. Well they weren't. Same with the wine. Needless to say, bill came out, they wouldn't split it, well it was $2100 dollars. So even though wee thought we stayed in our personal budget, it cost us over $100 a person. I had a salad, my husband had chicken, neither of us had wine, we each had a few bits of appetizers. Should have been about $50 with tip. We had to pitch in $200 atleast. Ruined a really fun dinner, but have is something to laugh about next reunion."}
{"text":"BF took me here for Valentine's dinner. I usually  hate going out on this holiday, but who can say no to Italian food in your belly. I was pleasantly surprised by the fact that it wasn't over-crowded although, I later found out it was because we had went right before closing.  The atmosphere is quaint and romantic with a wooden staircase to die for . The bartender & waitstaff we're so gracious and accommodating it felt like we were in our own kitchen sitting at the bar stuffing our faces amongst family. If that hasn't told you enough already I haven't even gotten to the food part, we let them pick out items for us and everything that was brought was nothing short of amazing. If you don't like to over-indulge in cured meats, spices, with vinegars and lots of bread then you just aren't a human. It was rather late for something heavy like a pasta but I can guarantee I'm going back to try very soon. Even though it was late I could not pass up on For dessert we had creme brulee and a chocolate mousse and if I could have taken 5 of each home I would have. I know it's a bit of a drive for most of us here in Las Vegas but I can guarantee if you want to place that is not crowded or impersonable like most of the restaurants on the strip and take the extra time and drive down to Lake Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Wonderful restaurant, with a great menu.  I had escargot, and the steak frites, and both excellent.   The atmosphere is fantastic, very old world European with tons of character.  We sat out on the patio, and while it was chilly outside, the enclosed patio provide nice Lake Las Vegas view, and we were nice and warm inside.  We will certainly return, and would highly recommend."}
{"text":"What an amazing dining experience.  Lakeside, service was over the top.  Yuri was such a great server, Michalando also conversed and took care of us, our glass never empty.  Silverware switched at every serving.    We started with amazing French onion soup.  The Caesar salad amazing, followed by amazing main courses.  Dining outside under lit tress and a fire pit, while looking out over the lake with romantic music.  Truly amazing."}
{"text":"After starting off with the original server forgetting about us. Alessandro stepped in and stepped up . I had the quiche which was flavorful and was a great pairing with the salad. My boyfriend had he Niçoise salad he opted to skip the canned tuna and substituted salmon.The greens were fresh and salmon was flavorful. Alex brought us not only a complementary cheese and meat plate but also a lemon brûlée to finish meal. His service and thoughtful hospitality turned our frowns upside down."}
{"text":"Great service, amazing views, and excellent food! If you're ever in lake Las Vegas, I would recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"Great service and great food. Beautiful location on the lake. Perfect place for a date."}
