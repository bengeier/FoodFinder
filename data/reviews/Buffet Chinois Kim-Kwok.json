{"text":"Above average buffet.   They have some dishes yoo would come here for alone.  Spicy Calamari,  a mushroom dish, and their fish on the buffetline is usually pretty good.   Efficint staff clears dishes quickly.  All in all a good bargain if you like buffets."}
{"text":"Great value: good selection, tasty, and well-prepared.   All you can eat for under CDN $10.00.  Family-friendly atmosphere; not noisy.  Many Asian families visit, so that`s a good sign.  Now has a BYOB policy,"}
