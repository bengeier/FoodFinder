{"text":"I come here on late weekdays to fill my craving for curry beef brisket with soup noodles! It's not extremely spicy but it's definitely hot temperature - which makes it heart warming on a cold Canadian winter day.   Service was average-decent. Waiter was generally polite and checked in enough."}
{"text":"What do you really ever want from a Pho place? Order on a form, no need to communicate with the servers. The venue is large (as are most suburban places) and full.  Serving sizes are HUGE. They have Small, Large, XL. I ordered a large, and it was like a basin that I could wash my face in.  Couple of things to note: You have to request thin noodles, or you get those thick udon-y ones. You can request to have the bo tai served on the side. Pay at the counter. They will split the bill for you if you go with a giant group."}
{"text":"For  what it is, it's OK: a franchise, owned and operated by Chinese people instead of Viet, located in the burbs. The menu quite extensive but the fact that its only in English and Cantonese speaks to thr lack of authenticity. Being a Vietnamese person, I find it hard to fathom a so called Viet restaurant in the GTA, that would have the audacity to not have Viietnames decriptions on the menu.  The renovation makes the place look nicer to keep up with Pho Bistro which opened next door, i suppose.   The Pho broth isnt bad but they skimp on the bean sprouts and basil. I like the fresh soft noodles but it's not to everyones liking.  The place Is in my rotation of restaurants but only because it's nearby and has decent pho for when i need a quick fix or need more variety than the usual pho places can offer up."}
{"text":"CRAPPY SERVICE, crappy food. No idea why my best friend loves this place and dragged me here a few times. \"Pho is pho!\" he argues. Little does he know that there are slight variations and nuances with the taste of the broth and of overall experiences. Pho is not pho! Well not at this joint...  It's funny, that this restaurant has been open for more than a decade and only has 9 yelp reviews as of this posting.....   Food: 2 Service: 1 Ambience: Looks like they cater to only Viet speaking people Overall: 1 of 5 stars. Will not come out of my way to come here... ever."}
{"text":"Good dependable pho place. Everything you'd expect"}
{"text":"Poor service and just as bad food. I'm honestly not sure which is worse. I grew up close by and I don't know why I used to think this place was good. I've had way better pho in smaller cities than Toronto. The broth is bland. They also refused to take my American credit card because it didn't have a chip.   Stay away from here if you prefer to eat good food, or if you want good service."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for years.  The cashier/server now recognizes us and always greets us with a smile, and some friendly chit chat.   My husband and daughter could eat here daily and never complain.  Even if we are in a different part of the city, they'll want to come to the Yonge/Steeles location.  We usually get the beef brisket pho (sometimes with tripe), the grilled pork vermicelli and the mango salad.  The pho and bun (vermicelli) are the best that we've tasted in the city.  We have become so sensitized to these flavors, this has become the standard that my family judges their other pho experiences against. The food is tasty, fast and super reasonable.  Where in the city could you feed 3-4 people for under $25?  I would give them a 5, but the bathrooms and ceilings need some TLC."}
{"text":"The best Pho restaurant in town. I feel in love with Pho noodle cause of this restaurant. Really recommended, should try the spring rolls"}
{"text":"The Toronto Lover system: 5 stars = Must visit! 4 stars = Really good. I take my friends here. 3 stars = Somewhat worth it... if you have nowhere better to go. 2 stars = Below average. Attend only when necessary. 1 star = Do not visit!   There is a late night Xe Lua Vietnamese Restaurant on Spadina, south of Dundas, but the two have very little in common. They serve the same dishes, they have the same logo and menus, and the same name, but this one on Steeles (tucked behind the Swiss Chalet plaza near Hilda) is actually a great, affordable family restaurant, whereas the other is a student-filled, after-club dive.  Try the duck leg soup for $7. Try a curry rice dish for about the same price. There is usually decent service and friendly patrons.  Is it a hidden gem? No. The food is not spectacular, and you will not write home about it. But in this area, there's a lot to be said for a good, affordable pho place. They also serve very tasty fruit drinks that are something like bubble tea.  3 stars"}
{"text":"Wow. I came here after searching for good pho in my area, and let me tell you, this is a great place for it. As soon as we walked in the scent of pho just hit us and I got super excited. It did not disappoint. I haven't studied the menu as laboriously as my boyfriend, but I'm pretty sure they have every traditional vietnamese dish and then some!  We ordered the large traditional (with absolutely everything inside) and while I usually don't finish the broth, I couldn't even finish the noodles/beef! Only $7.75. The broth was really good, like top 3, and there was so much meat... they also served bean sprouts, lime and thai basil on the side... ask for chilis too! We also ordered grilled chicken and shrimp rolls - so gooooooood, very fresh and well seasoned, great portioning.  Needless to say this will be my go-to for vietnamese food, I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Disappointed.... service is worse i ever encounter... not coming in here again. They give a glass with a bleach, are those people trying to kill their costumer?"}
{"text":"Been here a bunch of times over the years. Service is always quick and food is always of consistent quality! I usually get the Satay Beef with Rice Noodle Soup ($7.50), not too spicy, portion is not that big though.   This place is usually not that busy, so usually pretty easy to get seats.  One thing to note is that you can only pay with card if your order is $10+."}
{"text":"My best friend loves this place and this has been one of her go-to lunch spots for the last year or so.   Pros -Cheap and filling  -huge portions  -plenty of variety  -yummy broth (even though I put way too much hot sauce in mine so maybe that has something to do with it lol)  -clean, nice atmosphere -quick service  -friendly service  -bean sprouts are a nice touch, and always fresh. ALWAYS.  -consistent  Cons -quality of the meat. I know this is a small thing to complain about but sometimes the chicken is good stuff, sometimes its weird gross bits, but its a hit or miss. The quality of the beef isn't very good either and that alone will turn me off from coming back, which I haven't in quite some time. It would probably be ok for others, like my best fries who'll eat anything, but I'm picky (sorry!)   Otherwise, the menu items are plenty and there's lots of choice. Can get pretty packed, which is a good sign that maybe its just me with my weird poultry preferences, but overall good quantity for the price."}
{"text":"We stopped in on Sunday June 25 for a late lunch. We had just placed our order. A server then placed cutlery wrapped in napkins on our table. Instantly little bugs started running out all over our table. We pointed it out to the server, cancelled our order and left. Will never recommend or return."}
{"text":"In comparison to other locations of Xelua restaurants around the city, not amazing. Their cups and cuterly, etc. are overly bleached and you can smell it before you use the utensils. They swipe their tables to clean them -- not atypical of an Asian place sadly.  Their food is ok. I usually get 113 - flank brisket noodle soup and their flank is good, but at times, it can be overly fatty. We usually order the vietnamese coffee, and they never bring extra hot water to brew more coffee. The waiters and staff don't care too too much about service.   The xelua restaurants at Major Mac and Bayview & at Leslie and Finch are better quality with the same food."}
{"text":"Despite the old school comforts that pho brings (giant bowl of soup, vietnamese fast food), this place has upped their game. The restaurant is clean, spacious, and comfortable. Their communal tables still provide plenty of space so you're not elbowing your neighbour. The service is quick, and the ordering sheets make it clear and simple when paired with their menu (so many options!). The food here is pretty standard - nothing stands out as amazing, but if you mess up pho, then ... it's a pretty bad thing. I ordered the usual tripe and beef pho and spring rolls. Both came out piping hot and were delicious. We also had a dry noodle dish, but the bbq pork that came with it was shredded to bits, so it was far too dry to be enjoyable. Communal chopsticks and spoons as usual, but if you're worried about germs they also have wooden chopsticks (the take-out kind) if you ask for them."}
{"text":"A friend suggested this place to me, and I said sure, why not?  Had my doubts, but the first thing that sold me was the smell when you walk in, you know you're in for some good eats.   The spring rolls were pretty great, as was the fried sausage, which was actually more like a battered patty, which was akin to a Chicken McNugget, which is awesome.  Had something called Bun, with beef as my meat, I enjoyed it a lot.  I'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Not bad. Service was quick and the goat curry soup noodles I got was tasty. It was big and ended up being two meals for me (yay!)"}
{"text":"Love coming here for pho and specialty drinks. Huge selection of noodle soup and noodle dishes as well as other Vietnamese favourites at an affordable price.  Ordered the rare beef with tendon noodle soup and vermicelli with shrimp on sugar cane and bbq pork and a red bean with grass jelly milkshake. Never disappointed when I come here."}
{"text":"DISGUSTING CUSTOMER SERVICE. SIMPLY DESPICABLE AND I WANT EVERYONE TO BE WARNED!  My parents and I used to come to this place occasionally. Not that I expect much from viet joints but these employees ARE THE WORST!   Today's service: -when they wiped the table, they just flung the bits of food off the table onto the booth and chairs -no tea was given, not even after all the food came and we asked for tea twice -served vermicilli without the fish sauce -soggy noodles, tasteless broth -rude server attitudes  My mom goes up to pay. The lady gave her back $5 and some twoonies and a looney. My mom took all the change back because today's service did NOT warrant a tip. The lady at the cash said \"YOU NEED TO GIVE TIP\" and my mom said \"I was not happy with the service today\". The lady's response? Instead of asking \"what happened today?\", she told me my mom \"GO GO GO!\" and shooed her away in front of other customers.   ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING! WHY DON'T YOU CHANGE YOUR SERVICE AND ATTITUDE THEN YOU'LL GET TIPS?!   First of all, YOU DO NOT DEMAND TIPS.  Secondly, YOU DO NOT SHOO YOUR CUSTOMERS AWAY! My mother was not rude in her response, she was telling you she was not happy today and you don't ask why?! No wonder I see other reviews here saying the same about demanding tips or charging it on the card machine.  Thirdly, we complained to the manager on the employee's piss poor attitude and he didn't seem to care.   TERRIBLE SERVICE. HORRENDOUS. DO NOT GO HERE! I will be telling everyone I know."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday afternoon. In addition to the plaza parking in front, there is a huge parking lot behind the restaurant (almost a bit creepy)   We chose to come here for the Xelua \"name brand\" and we had not been to their other locations before. The place was spacious and clean. However the food was sub par. The rice noodles in my pho were not cut evenly. Some were thin and some were too wide. Beef balls in the pho tasted like they were cooked hastily after being taken out of the freezer.   Too bad cause I actually did have high hopes for Xelua... Maybe their other dishes are better but I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"An update after they have had their doors closed for 5 weeks for a remodel and, wow. Talk about a total transformation. I feel upset that I didnt take pictures of the before and after in this place, but it looks much nicer now. Very open, much more of a cleaner look to things. Wooden table tops, nice silver stands, the servers still look the same, but their surroundings are very much improved.  Taking this new opportunity with the new look my girl and I decided to be adventurous and order things we never have before. I decided on the Pineapple Beef Fried Rice, and she did the curried chicken with vermicelli noodle soup.   Wow, were we glad we strayed off course for this one, the best fried rice I have ever eaten, nice cooked pieces of marinated beef with sugar snap peas, carrots, egg, onion, and pineapple. It was all fantastic, added a little soy sauce and it was perfect. I normally don't like fried rice, but this certainly made me forget that thought. The Curry dish as my fiancee pointed out had huge chunks of chicken that were just falling off the bones they were attached to. A thick yellow broth coated everything and made it look like she was basically eating mustard, it smelled and tasted very good, although I can't handle much curry, she can like a champ, although I hear she is paying for it now. This place is still her favorite Vietnamese place to eat at, and now it looks even better."}
{"text":"one of the better Xelua locations. they always have the grilled jumbo shrimp available (most places don't have it, even though it's on the menu) the garlic sauce that comes with it is super good, wish they can put more! the beef noodle soup is salty, but i think all pho noodle soups are salty, maybe it's just the way it is. the pho with fresh noodles is good - good amount of meat and noodles. I don't have a problem with anything on the menu here, always come here to grab a quick bite when in a hurry. there's always plenty of seats and parking outside."}
{"text":"Came here with a very large group, and we had wonderful and fast service. Great pho too!"}
{"text":"always reliable for a steaming hot bowl of pho on a cold -25 degree winter night. not super awesome high quality stuff, but satisfying. same chain as the one in chinatown.. which every down-town student probably has many many lovely/drunken memories for.   what i like: 1) pho, watever type of pho, just get a small, no matter how hungry i might think i am. get a SMALL! 2) bun bo hue - some spicy thick noodle dish, i love the spice, also incredibly salty, 3) bbq pork or pork with chicken on rice. 4) beef curry with rice 5) oh ofcourse, spring rolls are awesome.   yum, a little bit over dose on MSG, but i will come again."}
{"text":"Severely disappointed. Used to love going here for pho. Came religiously. Came back recently for the holidays and the quality of food has dropped substantially. Noodles were \"soggy\" soup base tasted weak. Incredibly disappointing."}
{"text":"Those familiar with Vietnamese restaurants know what to expect from here (Xelua restaurants have been around Toronto for ages). The quality of the food is just average, but they've stayed in business where others have come and gone - so our family still comes here for our Pho fix.  Service is pretty basic and you'll need to flag down waiters quickly when they scan the room. Prices are cheap ..however, prices have gone up by about $0.50-1.00 in the past months. Regular Phos are $6, Larges are $7 and X-Larges are $9.  Xelua gets a rating between a three and a four depending on how much I'm craving Pho. And yes the tea cups occasionally smell like cleaner/detergent."}
{"text":"Clean your bathrooms, I went back after a year and it's the same story. Bathrooms are disgusting I can see flies everywhere, wait staff appear unhappy .... smiles are free at McDonald's but not here.  I also remember one suugested a tip.  There's 2 other good options in the area Pho Bristro in plaza east of them and Pho Viet at Bathurst and Steeles."}
{"text":"It was a Saturday night and they were relatively empty, there were only a couple other tables. Despite this, the service here wasn't that great and the servers weren't that attentive. They had a wide selection of items and the prices were good.   The food was decent. I ordered the pho with raw beef and beef balls. The noodles were great but I found the beef a bit thicker than I'd like and a bit dry. The beef balls could have also been better.   They only accept credit cards if your order is over $10 and we had to walk to the register to pay.   Not bad. I would come back if I were in the neighbourhood to try their other noodles."}
{"text":"I've been a regular here for my entire life. Way before they did the renovation where the format of the store was completely different. The Pho here was consistent and had plenty of meat juices floating on the top of the broth. I loved it. My friends loved it. We would come here probably 3-4 times a month.   However, recently the ownership of the store was changed and with it, we got different waiters and the pho no longer comes with my favourite spicy chili. The broth ingredients are also missing its special flavour. I'm quite disappointed now and I have to look for another place that offers thick pho noodles the same as trainhead now.   I hope the one downtown is still good...... as I know for sure that the one at leslie and finch and the one at markham plaza are plain awful."}
{"text":"Great neighbourhood joint. Good pho and appetizers, all of which were tasty. Good portion sizes. Big restaurant and lots of tables available with many filled up even at 9 pm on a week night. The only downside is the service is slightly slow and the tables are sticky and dirty which is huge for me. But I can forgive them when I have a pho craving and am in the area. They serve one of the better bowls of pho."}
{"text":"Haven't been back here for a while due to bad service and rude staff. Came back because was in the area and wanted pho and this was the closest one. Nothing has changed, you get greeted by a employee far away who just points randomly at a empty table and you have no idea which one they are pointing at and then when you sit down takes a while for them to realize you and I had to even ask for a menu."}
{"text":"Awesome Vermicelli best in Toronto.  Location can get packed after 12pm so has early lunch at 11am and it was very quiet and the food arrived ar our table much faster.  I recommend this location over the Spadina one."}
{"text":"Sometimes even meat eaters need some veggies in their life. I say this because veggie pho is one of my all time top comfort foods. I don't care that the soup broth isn't veggie, it's the chunks of veggies that I crave.  Unfortunately for me I'm out of luck when visiting either locations of Xeula (also known as Train).  Xeula is one of many pho restaurants in the city. This location being the sister to one right in the heart of downtown Chinatown.  It's constantly getting rave reviews from friends who are pho phans (hah get what I did there), but honestly it's really not the best in the city.  The broth is underwhelming and lacks flavour, and there isn't enough meat in the beef and beef ball soup. Even the service is questionable at best. So you're probably asking yourself why I would go there if there are better places that have more options? Well let's just say I'm a really good friend and went along with it.   Nevertheless, you're doing yourself a huge favour by finding another pho place to go to if you want really delicious pho."}
{"text":"Went for the first time on a Friday night, as this place came recommended by a Vietnamese friend who billed it as well priced and good quality.    We got there and the prices were cheap, like most of these places.    We ordered:  cold shrimp roll curry beef brisket with rice noodle in soup sate beef with egg noodle in soup whole pan-fried fish pineapple beef fried rice (for the kids)  After ordering, I visited the restroom...Now I don't have high expectations of a cheap joint's facilities but let's just say it was obvious that I was looking at days of neglect to the point of needing to hold my breath.   At that point I decided that irrespective of the food to come, this would be my first and only visit based solely on facility cleanliness. I find it hard to imagine that the lack of standards wouldn't extend to other areas of the operation.  And then the food came...  I have never had to fight with brisket before.  I literally would have needed a knife and fork to eat the beef. The beef in the fried rice was so tough it couldn't be eaten (seriously).    The sate beef soup was yummy, same for the pan-fried fish.  Service is so poor it was actually comical.  We left after 15 minutes with about 50% eaten.  At only 34.50 before tax and tip I see it as a cheap lesson."}
{"text":"Looking for best vermicelli bowl in Vaughn, North York. This isn't it.  Who knows, maybe the pho is out of this world, but I'll try someplace else before I come back."}
{"text":"Am a sucker for beef soup with the refreshing bursts of bean sprouts every couple of bites.   Xelua can deliver it piping hot in a generous serving of beef and cow insides turned edible for weaker stomachs like me. Plain rare beef soup is the popular choice for the less adventurous with the right amount of onions and perfect noodles.  Another fave: spring rolls! Must-have sides if you're a bit starved for one of Vietnam's famous food staples.  The service here seems to vary from the many different servers and they really insist on the tip even before handing over the bank card machine.   I believe in tipping well for the exchange of deserving service and am not too demanding although some of their customers may find this approach rude. I chuckled it off since the older male server forced a smile despite my jokingly \"excuse me?!\" gesture I gave him. A good sport calls for a good tip."}
{"text":"Been here only 2 times and I would probably not go eat here again. The reasons are:  - the workers are so rude -the food is so dirty and doesn't seem properly cooked  -they forced us to give them tips even though all they did was gave us bad quality food (uncooked and dirty) and a bad service    Not worth paying for. I went to eat in the restaurant for the 2nd time because I thought it would not be so bad as the 1st time it happened but it was worst."}
{"text":"Hearty broth with plenty of flavor.  Great sizes (three available med/lrg/xlrg).  Excellent value (large brisket/rare beef pho $6.50).  Fresh spring rolls loaded with shrimp including lettuce and basil leaves as well in addition to the standard.  Staff is actually Cantonese but don't let that keep you.  Service is quick without conversation which is of course infinitely better than slow and chatty especially when I'm craving pho which is most times.  Would consider going again although still have others in the area to scope out.  Overall, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I can't believe that I've yet to write a review of this place - it's been a standby for meals with friends and family for more than a decade.  Xelua (colloquially and commonly called 'Train' because of its logo) is cheap, delicious, and a mainstay of northern Toronto. The restaurant is located at the back of a faceless retail plaza, but those in the know have been coming here for years in search of a hot bowl of pho. Smoothies are unexpectedly delicious, and highly recommended.  Size 'large' is probably your best bet - it's more than enough to be filling, and rumours abound that XL is merely the same as large, with a bit more soup added. I almost invariable order number 110 - with tendon, tripe, and rare beef, it's the best of all Vietnamese worlds."}
{"text":"This place likes to rip you off of what you order. It's salty mediocre Vietnamese food and they also advertise that they give you a certain number of pieces in your order then do some math where you receive -1 of what is advertised on the menu.  They also refuse to acknowledge or tell you about it. Do not recommend"}
