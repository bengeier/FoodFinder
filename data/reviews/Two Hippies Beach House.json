{"text":"In the area and decided to stop for lunch. My wife ordered the loaded nachos and I ordered the loaded hot dog. Both were truly spectacular.  Good flavors. Big quantities. Nice people behind the counter. We're going back for sure."}
{"text":"My friend always wanted to try this Two Hippies. It was horrible. We did not get what we ordered, not sure what it was but we know what it wasn't. We ordered the special tea and when the guy brought it to us he said \" we ran out\", it was more expensive that the regular tea and we were not offered any kind of refund. Waste of time and money."}
{"text":"My wife just brought home a fish taco, pretty good.  Not amazing but one of the best I have had in a while.  I don't want to set expectations too high but worth a try!"}
{"text":"I am new to the area seen this place and had to try. The fish tacos were awesome, the huckleberry lemonade delicious , the staff very friendly:)"}
{"text":"Jumped out of dead stop traffic on a whim. A lot of thought went into the decor both inside and out. I'm certain it helps for walk in traffic. Nice guy at the counter was friendly and talked up the food in a non-salesman like way. Normally I shy away from Carne Asade unless I know the place, but this cat talked me into it. The green Chile Carne Asade is not to be missed. Obvious marinated in Chile's, not dressed in them after the fact.  Well done I say! Got 3 huge tacos for $5 and 2 waters for a buck a piece. Great deal/ good ambiance/ friendly knowledge staff. If you're in the neighborhood check it out."}
{"text":"$1.50 TACOS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Yum!
This place was recommended to us by a local. We asked where to get a good cheap taco and this place hit the nail on the head. 

Two hippies are on the right track with this place. It's a bit small and it took about 20 min to get my food (they were really busy) but it was worth it. If I lived in Phoenix I would come here daily. 

A word about the fish tacos...they are good but seem as though they might use canned fish instead of fresh grilled chunks like most places. Considering the price this is acceptable!

The drinks and baked goods looked great though I haven't yet tried any. I'll save those for next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"It's under new ownership and is called \"the beach house\" now. I've been coming here for years BUT the last 2 visits where pretty phenomenal. Fresh tacos-nopales, crispy fish, carne asada and pork. Excellent! All of them. This place is better as of late then when it first opened! It def went downhill in my opinion after a couple years and \"2 hippies\" were poppin up everywhere. Well this cool taco shop is \"back\" so I'll keep coming back."}
{"text":"I love this place! I used to come here every week when I was in high school. I had an extra long lunch one day and I thought I would come back and see if it was still as good as it once was. It is! 

I got a burrito and a lemonade. The lemonade was freshly made and tasted like a childhood summer day. The burrito was filled with pork, rice, cheese, cilantro, some pico, and of course topped with lava sauce. 

The staff was just as laid back as I remembered! Always a great decision to go to the beach house."}
{"text":"The bf and I wanted to check this place out for a while, we had even gone once on a Sunday, but sadly it was closed. 
So we went back last week, and it was delightful. It reminds me of a little place you might find in Venice beach. We both had the three tacos. He had some kind of meat and thoroughly enjoyed it, I had the black beans. Fresh ingredients, yummy salsa, and flavored blended lemonades (try the pineapple! Mmmm), made for a great lunch."}
{"text":"Awesome place, cool little beach house, makes you feel you're not in Phoenix for a bit!  highly recommended."}
{"text":"I went in expecting a very nice fish taco, but the porridge/mush that passed for fish was fishy and nasty... how's that for the start of a review?

Ok, the place is nicely enough furnished if you think a la chuy's or chipotle's metal furnishings but with more crap on the walls.  It's clean, the people were pleasant and nice and the counter service fine.

The wife ordered a hotdog, i'm sure she'll review that.  I wasn't impressed.  But let's get to the rest of the food.  I ordered the 3 pack of tacos for $5.  Ok price.  

Green beef, pork and fish.  All of them came wrapped in aluminum foil with sticky but cold flour tortillas and the same mess of cabbage, tomato and white and yellow cheese.  All were freezing cold which made the meat luke warmish.  

They were all a miss for me.  I would not step back in this place for a taco.  Fatty pork is fine, if its cooked nicely, but this was not. Green beef was ok, as long as I piled the pretty good tomatillo salsa over it.  The fish...let's leave it at ugh.  If this is their specialty, it's over already.  

This is Sunnyslope, and with the authentic delicious taco and burrito choices around here, this place is only competing with the tacos across the street at Jack in the Box, and I would probably eat those before I'd touch another one of these, it was that bad for me.

Sorry, hippies.   This wasn't good.  If you are going to come into a Mexican part of town you'd better bring the meat to compete.  You are far outclassed in taco land.

So, after some thought I decided rather than just pan the place, I'm giving suggestions:  
1. use a paper or wax paper between the aluminum and taco, or you have a mess.
2. do something with that too cold cabbage/cheese/tomato
3.  grill the fish and don't smother it / chop it up.  make sure its fresh.
4.  get a better cut of pork, go organic (maybe it is), season it better
5.  keep the happy people in front, they were nice
6.  don't blend your lemonade with ice, it was awful and too sweet
7.  quit buying your chips at Costco, those round ones suck
8.  do something with the guacamole, it was ok just being avocado and lime, but it was pureed.  keep it chunky.
9.  get more input from your mexican chefs, they probably know what is wrong
10. Both the red and green salsas were good, just need a taco to go with it."}
{"text":"Truly not a great place for mexican food! The burritos were cold inside, cheese not melted and not wrapped correctly. Basically the goods were tossed in the middle of a tortilla and that was it. Yuck! Won't be going back!"}
{"text":"I eat at the Beach House at least once a week.  The fish tacos and carne asada tacos are my favorites, but I recommend checking the daily specials before ordering.  The food is always hot and fresh, and the service always friendly."}
{"text":"Real talk all jokes aside I have had better fried fish tacos than I've had here! In fact I haven't even had a better fish sandwich then the fish tacos that I've had here, in fact I haven't even had better fried fish dinner to fried fish tacos that I had here! Not only was the staff helpful and friendly but the prices were beyond reasonable! It's not expensive at all. If you're reading this review and you aren't in the Two hippies parking lot you're all the way wrong! The set is cool and it's not in a location that's hard to find or hard to leave from when you're done eating. Are you still reading this review? If so you better be waiting for your two fish tacos you just ordered from two hippies! I just found my new favorite taco joint. I rock with Two Hippies all day!"}
{"text":"Just to start out don't even believe a word from Don S. review, he's so full of it his eyes are brown.  And what does someone from the left coast know about mex. food!  He probabably thinks Chi Chis is the bomb or tres margaritas or some other chain.  Also who would buy 2 tacos and not take advantage of the 3 for 5.00 deal?  He probably shops for groceries when he's hungry!  Well anyway, I eat at the 2 hip. at 7th, and dunlap.  Order the carne asada taco and a coke.  Dump abunch of the mild red sauce on it and take a big bite, its not you average tasting taco but I have been there many times  and I like it.  Oh by the way anyone that knows anything about carne asada it can be a little chewy, its hard to trim and I don't make a big deal about.  And thats The Truth."}
{"text":"Not very impressed with my first visit. Quesadilla was lacking in many areas. Very little meat inside. Not impressed, with the guacamole inside. Made the Quesadilla very soggy and difficult to eat. 
I had a Burrito. 
Burrito was good size and the Chicken was flavor. 
Not the best though"}
{"text":"I tried Hippie's with 2 of my coworkers today and thought it was pretty good. First, for $1.50 a taco, you can't beat it as each of them weighs about a pound each! 

I tried a pork and a daily special of green chili shredded beef. The pork was better than the beef and both could have used a little seasoning, but I am stuffed! I liked the cabbage, rice, pinto bean mix in the taco along with the 2 choices of salsa and thank goodness for all the napkins as these are messy! 

It is quite busy at lunch so it can be a bit of a wait to get your food. But compared to other little lunch haunts, this one actually had enough parking and seating to accommodate all the customers. They also serve different flavored lemonades (blood orange, watermelon etc) which I will be trying next time I come here. 

All in all, a solid 3 stars!"}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time today. I love the fish tacos. The chips w/ guac was overpriced IMO. The red salsa they provided for the tacos was great on the tacos and with the chips. They don't take plastic but have ATM on site."}
{"text":"Best grilled shrimp tacos I've ever had in my life. Even their brownies and burritos and fish tacos are delicious! The service is fast and friendly, and the place is really cute! I love that they have trivia cards on the tables. And the seating area really makes you feel like you're eating near a beach in Cali because it's so laid back and chill. It's a fun and casual environment with great food and drinks-- can't go wrong! Definitely one of my favorite places!"}
{"text":"Now a days you would be hard pressed to find a decent meal for $5 that was actually edible. While fast food joints continue to feed the nation processed garbage Two Hippies stands out from the crowd with their large portions, organic veggies, and fresh natural meats. 

On top of that, the staff has been nothing but helpful, friendly and really makes you feel like family. Brandon actually takes the time to make sure my tacos are made correctly on a daily basis. If it is Monday through Friday, you can usually catch me here. Also as far as vegetarian options go, the black bean taco or burrito with rice is probably my favorite. The daily specials are a hit as well.

Can't lose with Two Hippies! Much love guys! 

Tony"}
{"text":"I just had lunch with my daughter. Awesome fish tacos. I have been here multiple times. Aside from great food, the owners are very friendly. This is a great neighborhood spot not to miss. If i had the option i would give Two Hippies at two more stars."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite lunch spots. Their specials are always delicious and I don't really have to think more than just asking for the special.  Reasonable prices and totally solid personal.  Repeat as necessary for your burrito needs."}
{"text":"Just do it... it's super inexpensive and super delish... just go eat there... seriously... I wish I would have thought of this little idea..."}
{"text":"I couldn't have been more disappointed with my first venture into a Two Hippies.  My husband and I rushed home to see who could hammer this place on Yelp first (he beat me).  I ordered a hot dog because I love hotdogs.  This one was large and cheap, but the flavor was mostly salt, and it looks boiled, which did nothing to improve it.  The bun was excruciatingly hot, and as soon as it cooled enough to eat, was excruciatingly tough and chewy (either overly steamed or overly microwaved).  Hot dog alone would have earned 2 stars, but unfortunately I tried to share the hubby's tacos...  eeeewww, the fish mush tacos were downright nasty.  Seriously, they were not just lacking good qualities, they had a mushy texture and bad taste.  The pork in the pork tacos was fatty, chewy, and overly marinated.  The green beef was tolerable, but nowhere near pleasant.  Overall a bad food experience and I came home hungry enough to pig out on Christmas cookies.  Atmosphere is fine, place is clean, service quick and pleasant - but that does not make up for the food."}
{"text":"I'm new to area and saw this place driving by one day, so I stopped. The owners were working and walked me through their menu. 

I had the green chili beef burrito. It was HUGE and delicious! I see a lot of reviews from the past saying they don't accept credit cards but they now accept credit cards! Stop by and check them out!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick lunch, shared the fish and chicken tacos. The blueberry mint lemonade is great, try it. The 3 taco special is a good deal, especially if you  like chicken tacos."}
{"text":"I was just visiting Phoenix from South Dakota for a few days. I found Two Hippies on Yelp and thought I would give it a try. What a nice surprise!! The service was amazing, the atmosphere was really fun, and the quesadillas were fabulous. Great prices...lots of food!  I will be back!!"}
{"text":"What a fun, funky find.  This is our 2nd time fot lunch in 2 days.  The grilled fish tacos are delicious!  If we lived near Phoenix we would be regulars."}
{"text":"this is one of my favorite taco places. they have raised the price a little bit and reduced the size..which sucks. I always leave happy although my last visit I tried a crab taco that simply just didn't agree with me but my chicken and fish tacos...always delicious."}
{"text":"I have been hearing about the Two Hippies brand for awhile now, but was never near one around a meal time.  Now that my office is closer, I decided to try out the Mexican concept, because I love me some Mexican food!

I was a bit overwhelmed when ordering, it is not that they have a large menu by any means, but it is up on a chalkboard above the register, and I felt the pressure to order quickly.  It was not until after I ordered that I realized that they only took cash, and my wallet was filled with plastic!  I told the guy I would go run to the bank, but he pointed to the ATM machine in the corner, so I felt obligated to go ahead and pay the fee to get my $5 burrito.

I ordered the green chile beef, because I have been obsessed with that lately, and it also said that the burrito was served with rice, beans, cheese, lettuce and tomatoes.  Before I could make my way around to the pick-up window my order was ready.  I took my burrito back to my office and took a bite...it was good, but it was the green chile beef that I was expecting.  It was just shredded beef that had been seasoned with green chiles, it was good, but really just tasted like shredded beef.  The main issue I had with my burrito, other than it being the size of my head, was that it wasn't very hot.  I could tell that they attempted to warm up the tortilla, but didn't give it enough time to fully heat through, making the tortilla a bit stiff and hard to keep wrapped around the filling.  Another tell tale sign that it wasn't very hot?  None of the cheese even thought about beginning to melt!  I like it when the cheese starts to melt and blends in with all the other flavors, but nope, this cheese stayed in its purest unmelted form.

I might give this place a try again, while I wasn't blown away, the price is right and I see that there could be hidden potential."}
{"text":"Three mega tacos for five dollars cash.  Yes.  Get the fish...3 times."}
{"text":"I used to love this place when it first opened but the quality is starting to fall a bit and the prices have gone up.  It is still a fun place to go for food and chill.  I take first dates there to see if they can \"hang\".  It is my way of testing them.  If they can't appreciate a good hole in the wall then they cannot hang with me."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! Always good, fast, and friendly. 

The fish tacos are for sure my favorite."}
{"text":"I have yet to find anything on the menu that I don't like. It's a quirky and fun atmosphere, the staff is fast and friendly and all of my friends and family that I've brought here have loved it."}
{"text":"First time visiting Two hippies, LOVED it!! I had the beef chili tacos and the fried fish. So reasonably priced. Adorable decor. I will for sure come back and visit- it's a must!!"}
{"text":"Greatest kept secret on Camelback!  Love this place...the owners and employees are always so courteous. Food is great and feel like I am back in SoCal!"}
{"text":"This little gem of a place has some of the tastiest shrimp and fish burritos and tacos in the Valley. The grilled shrimp burrito is huge and all the ingredients fresh. If you're not that hungry, go for the shrimp tacos which are equally delicious. 
The fried fish taco is another one of my favorites there. The fish is crispy on the outside, tender and moist on the inside. They don't skimp on the ingredients and everything is fresh right out of the grill.  
The service is quick, efficient and friendly."}
{"text":"I so wanted to like this place.  I've driven by it several times, and at night the mulitcolored lights and cute signage give it an intimate, urban-hip feel.  I will say that the staff is super friendly, and the service was very good.  But for me, when I eat out it's all about the food, and it was not that tasty.  It was cheap, for sure, but I've had cheap, delicious food before and this was not it.  I ordered the blackberry lemonade and their special burrito of the day, a chicken burrito with green chile.  The lemonade tasted like cotton candy, and it wasn't actually a drink; it was a slushy.  The chicken burrito was pretty dry, and was filled with shredded lettuce, chopped tomatoes, and what looked like kraft shredded cheese.  It's my fault for not asking what all came on the burrito, but I HATE shredded lettuce.  I had to struggle to find any green chile, and when I did, it didn't pack a lot of flavor.  I wish I could recommend it, but I probably won't eat there again."}
{"text":"After leaving Sack's Cafe at 3:30 (23rd ave & Camelback), I have just enough time to skate over the extra five blocks to Two Hippies Beach House before I have to be to my other place of employment, Practical Art near Central & Camelback.  I ate at THBH two days ago and I've been plotting how many times I can make this excursion each week since. It's SO good.

Managing the cafe, I've learned a lot about food cost margins, and I saw another Yelper mention this in relation to THBH's pricing ($2 loaded tacos!).  And YES, we all need to eat here en masse and buy in BULK so this place can stay profitable enough to feed me!  And why shouldn't we?? This place has delicious food-- all muy fresca! 

I ordered two tacos, a Cactus Taco and their daily special-- Artichoke & Black Bean.  For some reason, I half expected them to be in corn tortillas, but I wasn't disappointed when I realized that they actually came in 6\" flour tortillas.  These things were stuffed to the gills, so they were a bit messy-- but I managed to very diligently get most of the food into my mouth.  I can accomplish a lot when I'm focused.  I ordered a blackberry lemonade to accompany my tacos, which was sweet, but tasty.  I think this is a great 'schtick' for the Beach House-- lemonade in something like a dozen flavors.  These folks are right on point thematically with everything they've put together here-- I've seen a few places go under for trying to encompass too many modalities.  

To tie a bow on it, FINALLY a place that proves buying local and healthy doesn't mean breaking the bank.  Heart these hippies."}
{"text":"I've been driving past this place for 3 years when I finally decided to try them out. I honestly didn't even know it was a food joint until the second year lol I just thought it was a fun looking place :p 
but their food is AMAZINGLY good. I got their carne tacos - Delicious.
Customer service was very pleasing and they even took the time to ask how to correctly spell our names haha no big deal to me if it's misspelled but the extra effort shows a lot to me."}
{"text":"Three words:  fried fish tacos! Seriously the best taco I've ever had.  Tempura-battered tilapia nestled in a bed of cabbage with some amazing special sauce is a taco worth every calorie!  Try it with the green sauce and a healthy squeeze of lime and you'll forever be hooked."}
{"text":"I had to check out the place since it looked like a classic taco shack you'd find in Mexico.  Fish taco was no good, cactus taco was decent, pinto bean taco, meh.  Salsa could have changed the game, but it was blah as well.  I'd give it 4 for ambiance, but wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Two hippies has consistently great food and service. They definitely make you feel at home. The food is always fresh and extremely tasty, definitely a party in your mouth. My personal favorite are the shrimp tacos and the rice bowls, but honestly everything is a treat. Speaking of treats don't forget to grab one of their decadent brownies on your way out, if there was a brownie heaven, they'd surely be there. Don't take my word for it, try it for yourself"}
{"text":"As a taco lover, I will try any taco place once. Unfortunately that's going to be my only visit here. The atmosphere is decent. It's all outdoor picnic table seating, which I don't mind unless it's crazy hot out. The cashier was less than helpful. We asked what the best tacos on the menu were, only to be told that  she didn't know it all tastes the same to her. Well, she was right. The Carne asada was dry and lacked any significant flavor. The green Chile was also lacking in the flavor department. My lady had a fish taco which she said was good. But the tacos had too little meat and too much lettuce. Overall, the place is neat, but the food needs an overhaul. I'll be skipping this place on my Taco Tuesday ventures."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's everything I look for when searching for local food joint. It's a little hole in the wall place with phenomenal food. The place gives off a great vibe with  all the random artwork and cool posters hanging around. The staff/owners are great people with a great taste in food. I was recommended their shrimp tacos; I tried them and I am in love. But their homemade green chili tacos are to die for. Great place, great people, and amazing food!!!"}
{"text":"this is a quirky little place with delicious fish tacos. you'll never run out of things to look at while you wait for your food. they have a random collection of things covering every inch of space. very cute. i would have given this place five stars, but the counter girl got a little sassy with me when i asked for some extra sour cream."}
{"text":"This Two Hippies location has been under a new owner for about 5 weeks now.  This management has changed the ingredients in the menu and now use fresh ingredients to make their items.  Give them a try if you haven't been there recently.  Had the stoner hoagie & bacon cheese burger.  Preferred the burger to the hoagie."}
{"text":"I thought this place was cool. It reminds me of a little California beach side taco joint. I got a chicken bowl with pinto beans, salsa, cheese and pico. I thought it was pretty good. As for the slushie I ordered, I would not recommend it. It was just Torani syrup and crushed ice. Save money and make one at home! Overall, not a bad experience."}
{"text":"Cool décor, mediocre food, eh-prices. 

I want to like it, really I do. Every time I leave Two Hippies I tell myself I probably should have ordered something else... But nope, still feels like an unskilled friend whipped something up real quick and poured cherry syrup in Minute Maid lemonade and called it gourmet. 

The food might taste better if the atmosphere and decor didn't get your hopes up. When you walk in to any of their locations you can't help to be excited about the possibility of falling in love with another trendy downtown restaurant, only to be disappointed. It's like a date with someone you met on Facebook who had a really interesting about me section and who's display picture portrayed them as a model, only to find out they're just average in real life."}
{"text":"One would think that finding vegetarian friendly Mexican food would be easy in a major metropolitan.  One would be wrong.

I was  pleasantly surprised that Two Hippies Beach House Outrageous Tacos and Burritos caters to vegetarians, in its very modest selection of items.  The menu only has a handful of items, and that three items were vegetarian friendly was a plus.

I recently ate at this small restaurant and was able to enjoy a bean and cheese burrito.  The pinto beans were free from lard and the rice was free from chicken broth.  The vegetables were organic, which is also a plus.

Inside the burrito, were beans, cheese, rice, cabbage, tomatoes, and onions.  The burrito was quite good.  Salsa was also included on the side, but it was only okay.  Truth be told, the burrito was flavorful enough without the salsa.

The other vegetarian items available were a cheese crisp and bean and cheese tacos.

The prices were quite reasonable.  For two vegetarians, we were able to eat for $14, which included a fantastic slushy lemonade, coke, and side of rice."}
{"text":"Two Hippies..... Brills!!!  This little nook in a parking lot is quite tasty and affordable.  3 slam packed tacos for under $5, can't beat that in these economic times, served up fast and fresh.  You totally need to check out this groovy light meal stop."}
{"text":"I live and work 2 blocks away, so the minute I saw the activity in the windows in preparation for opening I was excited.  Having a cheap, tasty taco place that close was a dream.

I've been here at least 15 times and haven't been disappointed, although some of the options are better then the others.  The pork  tacos have recently passed into the sublime category, the beefs are decent.  The chicken is a decent, healthy option.  Carne Asada is meh, and the fish taco is not nearly close to good ones that I have had.  With that said they include organic cabbage and tomatoes which is a huge plus in my book.  Their flavored lemonades range from fantastic to meh.

The best part is 3 huge tacos are $4.50.  While they may not be authentic, the healthy (non greasy, organic vegatables), cheap price, and super friendly owner make this place a once a week type spot."}
{"text":"I would love to love this place, support my local economy and all that Jazz but I just can't. The staff is always extremely friendly and I love the beach shack in the middle of Phoenix. Problem is, the food just isn't very good. The only thing more bland than the carne asada is the chicken. I've had mexican food in Minnesota and I'm pretty sure it had more character than this local gem. Sorry Two Hippies, you have a solid concept going but your menu needs a serious overhaul."}
{"text":"Cheap food, huge portions, nice employees, funky decor.  Pretty awesome."}
{"text":"Two Hippies is one of those places I selfishly hesitate to review - for fear the word of how awesome this place is will leak out to the rest of the world.  The menu is simple - tacos, and.... I think that's it - and super cheap tacos at that.  I'm talking like almost Taco Bell cheap.  And no disrespect to the great people of Taco Bell who practically raised me - but these are in an entirely different league.  So great, in fact, that I just have to overlook nearly all your other imperfections (like the bathroom door that doesn't lock, and those sticky old tablecloths.)  I must say though, true hippies would NEVER so sacrilegiously destroy a beautiful Kombi, cut it in half, and put it on display in front of their beach house like you did.  Lame!  I'm disappointed two hippies.  But I'll still come for the tacos."}
{"text":"Great place with lots of character! The new owner has really made some positive changes to this classic venue."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Not only is the food amazing, but the staff is extremely friendly and fast. We got the specialty burrito and the carne Asada tacos and they were some of the freshest tacos we've ever eaten. If we could give a higher rating than a 5, we would!"}
{"text":"Best tacos!!! I LOVE their fish tacos and my fiancé always gets their steak! They're so unique, fresh, and always delicious!!! The service is quick and friendly. :) :) If you haven't been here and are a taco fan, you have to go!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, service, vibe, and sauces!
Great approachable menu with variety and veggie option.  Wonderful girl with short hair at the counter described items, offered extras and options and displayed a sense of ownership for the great grub they're providing. 
Excellent experience, wish I was going to be in Phoenix again soon.

Keep up the Awesomeness!"}
{"text":"The owners are super friendly. I love atmosphere and the sandiego feel to it. Great fish and good prices"}
{"text":"I dream about this place at night.  They are cheap, fresh, and tasty.  Good place for veggie heads or folks who eat fish.  Can't speak for the chicken or beef, but have been with friends who enjoyed that stuff too.

The veggies are fresh and organic!!!  The beans are whole pinto, not lardy refried.   All tacos are $1.50! Big burritos are $4.  Tons of hot sauce in the back.  Drinks are a litle expensive, but it is hard to turn down a flavored lemonade with a fancy umbrella.

The owner is super cool.  Everytime I eat at this place, he makes sure to tell us that he appreciates our business.  I appreciate this buisiness myself,  I am always trying to find excuses to go out that way.  Luckily I have one such excuse today!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant, but they've gotten greedy:  They no longer accept credit cards and have already raised their prices once this year.  Come on!  Okay, but they're getting cheap and you wonder if they're paying taxes on all their profits when it's all cash, all the time."}
{"text":"Me gustaria este restaurante!

Voy aqui una vez al mes y yo compro dos tacos de carne asada y la carne es muy oferta. Me gustaria los limones con la carne!

La salsa no es picante, pero es muy sabrosa.

Muchas gracias para la buena comida!"}
{"text":"Casual, cool place with a beachy/hippy vibe to have some good food with friends. It is all outdoor seating so make sure you are going when the weather is nice. The fish tacos were good; I've had better but they were still tasty. The burritos were great."}
{"text":"Just discovered Two Hippies in Old Town and was so excited. Their fish tacos were amazing. Also, the homemade chips and guac was SO good. I ordered a cranberry flavored lemonade and it was so refreshing on a hot AZ day. Super excited to have this spot in my backyard!"}
{"text":"Awesome place to stop a grab lunch. Im always inpressed with the kindness I recieve when I eat here."}
{"text":"I love this place! Came here with my girlfriend a week ago and we've been back three times since then! The fish tacos are bomb, but I've also tried the grilled shrimp and carne asada tacos and all are fantastic. The staff is super friendly- I always go when this one girl is working and she's awesome and accommodating. Love the atmosphere and the ability to enjoy my eats outside. This has become my regular spot for sure! Absolutely recommend"}
{"text":"Not bad for a couple of white guys opening up a Mexican joint! I guess the words Mexican and joint back-to-back can be misleading! So I'll rephrase that with Hippie style restaurant with a hint of Mexican food. They definitely have Mexicans in the kitchen cooking so you can trust this place knows what they are doing at least! These Hippie are kinda smart :) The concept is different than what you would normally expect (but the name of this place should shine some light and give an environmental foreshadow) and the food is \"far out, man!\" Being Mexican myself, it's got my approval. 

The inside where you place your order gets crowded and is a small little area. The service is pretty good, they claim all the ingredients are \"organic\" and it does taste mighty yummy! Their fruit drinks are excellent too! The price is above average in comparison I think but bearable I guess. 

***The Bafroom: GOOD LUCK if you find yourself having the urge to use the restroom for anything! This is an outdoor eating environment and I didn't see any restrooms anywhere so no review on this. If you can correct me on this and lead me to my ultimate destination, please do and I will update this at a later date. In the meantime, better have some wet naps or Purell to sanitize your hands if you're a germ freak!"}
{"text":"In a hurry for lunch it was close to where we were going. The food  was good and the service was great definitely coming back!!"}
{"text":"Lunch at Two Hippies Beach House can turn a Monday into a fun-day. I discover something new every time I go - like the Village People album covers, bumper stickers, action figures and list of 10 worst rock songs.

I love going for lunch and getting a couple of tacos and sharing and order of chips and salsa. The tacos (and burritos) come with pinto beans, cheese, rice, cabbage, tomatoes, onions and a wedge of lime, but nobody squawks when you place a special order. (Big surprise, I 86 the tomatoes.) I've tried the fish, chicken, pork and carne asada tacos, and I think the fish are my favorite while the pork are a close second. The chips are store bought but the salsa makes it worth it. BTW, the tacos are cheap - $2 each. 

Their flavored lemonade is the bomb! I think I look for people to meet me there for lunch just so that I can get the blackberry lemonade. Pomegranate and raspberry are pretty tasty, too.

One of these days I need to try the red chili beef burrito...which gives me an excuse to go back.

I recommend carpooling if you're going for lunch. Parking is limited and the place gets busy quickly. They turn the food around fast, and you can always call ahead for a pick up order."}
{"text":"I come here regularly, it's my favorite place to eat. The food and atmosphere are amazing and give you that beach feel. Love the byob:)"}
{"text":"This place has awesome food. My husband and I went there this weekend and the sweet potato fries and cactus tacos are amazing."}
{"text":"Loved the seafood (Spicy shrimp, Fried fish, Grilled fish) tacos also tried the surf and turf burrito. All around I don't think you can go wrong here. On top of the awesome food the staff was super friendly."}
{"text":"Just ate there with the hubby.  Will not be back.  Ordered the 3 tacos for $5 thinking I'll get some great little street-style tacos. I should have known there would be a problem when I asked the girl at the counter if the chicken in the tacos was pollo asado and she looked at me like I was not from earth.  Okay, is it shredded chicken?  Um...it's marinated chicken.  Okay, bypassing the marinated chicken tacos, I order two carne asada and one fish taco.  

The girl hands me a bag and I think it's someone else's order because it looks like three huge burritos in there. But it's mine. I open my first \"carne asada\" taco and it's just this sad excuse of a taco...horrible white flour tortilla, some bagged shredded cheese, 5 pinto beans and meat that in no way tastes like carne asada.  It's fatty and lacks flavor.  Gross.  I move on to the fish taco, hey, they're famous for them.  I take one bite and push it aside. I take a couple more bites because it's covered in a tasty sauce that tries to hide the nasty fishy flavor.  I stop myself. Rubios does fish tacos better than this.

My husband had the \"pollo asado\" sandwich which I would give three stars but wouldn't go back for.

Next time we're looking for tacos or carne asada, we'll stick with America's Best Taco shop, thank you very much.  And next time we eat at a Two Hippies concept, we'll go back to their burger joint."}
{"text":"My fish tacos arrived in cold, store-bought, flour tortillas. 

Enough said."}
{"text":"Fish tacos are delicious! I order mind with extra chipotle mayo and extra onions! Sooo delicious. My boy friend always orders the carne asada on corn tortillas, and he is never disappointed. We call ahead to ensure we're in and out in just a few mins. The brownies are so delicious, so worth the couple bucks! 3 for $5 is a great deal."}
{"text":"This place is simple AMAZING. Best tacos in phoenix especially their fish taco. They know everyone by name. Plus, their prices are the best in town. 3 tacos for $6, you can't beat that. I frequently go to this place probably once every 1-2 weeks. I love how casual and quick it is. Don't keep passing by this place."}
{"text":"Love this little shack off the road. What a cute place! You can't go wrong the fish tacos. The feta is the only thing on them that sometimes makes me wince, but you can just ask for them without it. Be sure to stop here! This is a must see in Phoenix. Pro tip: bring cash. The tacos are cheap, but you must be in cash."}
{"text":"Tasty, Big Taco's.  Now that Chuy's has closed down I think I'll be here a lot more, and I'll always to remember to order extra for lunch the next day.

The food isn't stellar, but it is tasty, great value and better than I can make at home. In my book, that's good enough to make me a repeat customer.

I'm not sure if they have a licence to sell beer yet, but even so, it's worth popping in if you're in the neighborhood.  I think it's cash only so don't forget to head to the bank 2 blocks north first."}
{"text":"I was anxious to try this place because I heard such great things, but boy was I wrong.  I ordered delivery...just a simple hot dog, onion rings, and tacos.  Not only did they take an hour and a half to deliver the food but then I was lectured because I didn't have cash to tip them (you know, because all other delivery places I've ordered from allow to tip on the card you pay with).  She was rude and almost refused to give me the food because I didn't have cash tip.  Then, when I actually tasted the food, I was even more disappointed.  The hot dog was ok but the bun tastes like butter so that's pretty much all you can taste.  The onion rings were disgusting and we didn't even bother trying the tacos.  We went straight to Indulge burgers---better food and better service.  Skip this place for sure!"}
{"text":"cool little place ...eat before it gets to hot as you sit outside..they have misters but come on this is Phx and it gets hotter then he LL - had a great spring lunch in the sun today ."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to get a burrito.  It has everything I want and nothing I don't

I wish it had fountain sodas.  

The burgers are pretty good too."}
{"text":"Great food. This is one of my son's favorite places to get tacos now. He's a pretty picky eater and devours the Carne Asada tacos here. The food is always great and the service is fast."}
{"text":"I am from Tampa, Florida and it is hard to find fresh local food served there. My fiance and I found this place just driving by and had stop in. The atmosphere is awesome and the staff was great!!! Very good customer service. Not to mention the food was amazing!!! If you want some authentic fresh mexican food you have  go to Two Hippies Beach house. And if you have a sweet tooth you have to try their fresh baked brownies! BEST brownie I have ever had!!:: If we are ever back in Phoenix we defintely be coming back!!"}
{"text":"Thrifting about the countryside of the Sunnyslope area finding amazing deals on everything, including a gently used pair of Merrel's for $2.50 at Goodwill, makes you forget about your grumbling tummy. My husband and I are big fans of the Two Hippies Beach House on Camelback and have been meaning to try out some of the new locations. My secret desire is that the Two Hippies franchise will soon take the place of a few local McDonalds, bringing hope to the next fast food generation. When we walked into this location it was clean and friendly. There is much less kitsch on the walls than the other locations, it's more roomy inside and the menu is clear and easy to read. We strolled up to the counter and Mike asked for our order. He and my husband talked until our food came and he never ventured from being polite.
Great atmosphere. Great service. Now, the food.
I actually shutter and am still having a hard time with this. But, it must be written. Better than the Camelback location. I didn't even know what I was missing. I could taste every ingredient in my fish taco from the first to last bite. I could taste the fresh cabbage, the fish, the onion, the sauce. The cilantro was fresh (and I grow my own herbs at home, so that's saying a lot.) Before it all blended together. Now it all had it's own flavor perfectly matched inside a tortilla. I don't even like taco's, that's why I was so impressed with the Camelback location. But this was no taco, this was a foodgasm. Smaller portions, better quality, same fantastic service. Thank you Mike and your family for being the perfect Two Hippies owners. You will do well."}
{"text":"This location (16th St 2 Hippies) is a favorite of ours for location, quantity, and Friday Fish Fry! Centrally located, in between deliveries or on our way home, we must have the Friday Special. It's got some sort of Wasabi sauce on it that will clear your sinuses, yet it's somehow not to spicy. I don't know how they did it. Every now and then we will stop by and have lunch on a different day of the week. The atmosphere is always nice, you can sit on the wrap-around patio or on the north side of the building where there are chairs in the the grass. The bathroom is always clean. The people are always friendly. I agree, it takes a while to get your order, so plan accordingly. We actually call our orders in since we have to get back on the road ASAP. Also, sometimes they mess up, don't confuse them by getting fancy with the tacos. At least check the food before you leave. They'll fix it with apologies. 

 We've been here at least 20 times, and it's usually pretty good. The owner stops and talks to us too. If nothing else, try the Friday Fish Fry! I'm not a Fish Fry expert, but I really like it. Crispy Wasabi Fish Fry...."}
{"text":"You know when you see an old friend that you actually wished you had stayed connected with? He's here, behind the counter, smiling and taking your order. Great food! Great prices! Great people! Bring cash."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of their Taco special - 3 for 6 bucks. Initially I was disappointed the first time I came here because they did not have fried tacos. I tried the chicken tacos and they were huge and I got full on one taco. Took two home and fried them in a pan later that night to reheat them. Fresh they are great, fried at home for left overs they ROCK!  Fun decor and a real laid back atmosphere. I am just here for the winter so it was very comfy, in the summer it has to be hell as most their seating is outside. Don't miss this one, you cant cook this cheap! Great eats and very friendly staff."}
{"text":"I love me some hippies. These tacos are amazingly good. Lunchtime tip: Call your order in before you head over, because there is always a line."}
{"text":"Dive, but what do you expect from a place run by hippies?!  These guys serve up awesome tacos and burritos daily with a side of peace and happiness.  Love these guys, support them!"}
{"text":"A cup of Ice for $3! 
Are you Kiddin' me?


Three tacos for $5 is a good deal!
A can of Soda for $1 not a bad deal...
But when you order the lemonade for $3, it's 95% crushed ice & comes with a cute little umbrella in the straw, well this part is a \"rip off!\"
\"Seriously! \"

I usually order differnt Tacos & they are good! All the ingredients are fresh...The  fish, carne asada and chicken are my favorites.  
The green and red salsas are tasty. Also freshly made

If I didn't feel so ripped off on the lemonade, & I've made this mistake several times, I would give this place Five Stars!"}
{"text":"Wow, where to start?
I was so impressed and so happy we stopped in today. I wasn't expecting a taco place to have a loaded hotdog on the menu so I decided to give it a try. I was blown away by the flavors. I would have eaten another one right away if I wasn't full off that one. I also tried the chicken and pork taco. Both were above and beyond with juiciness and flavor. The service was really nice. Everyone seemed to love what they were doing and they were patient and helpful with our selections. I definitely plan to go back again and again!"}

{"text":"Well... I'm not sure what happened, or what is outrageous.

Okay, the first time I visited this place... carne asada burrito was pretty tasty. The fish tacos, were... you know, fish tacos. Reasonably priced, reasonably good. Plus good drink. Good enough to make a visit #2, and bring a few people with me. 

HOWEVER, visit #2... I must say, it is not reasonable to have your salivary glands dry up after a bite of fish taco, or chicken taco. 

In sum... some items here are outrageously salted and give you outrageous high blood pressure. 

Oh, I'll give an additional star for the availability of sriracha."}
{"text":"I was out running errands when I got hungry and decided to take a shot on Two Hippies Beach House. I pulled in and almost hit a crack head who walked in front of my car with two Phoenix Police Officers as witnesses to this mishap. After waiting for said crack head to skitter away, I got out of my car and approached the line. One of the officers said to me \"Good brakes!\" Whew! 

For my lunch, I decided on a fish burro sans cilantro and a peach lemonade. I was thankful for the cash I had in my wallet as they do not accept plastic of any form. 

I only had to wait for about 5 minutes for my food to be done and I was on my way home. I unwrapped my burro and took a huge bite. Hmm... nothing too amazing, just ok. First off. I DISLIKE when restaurants don't warm the tortilla that they make burros with and yes, this Blatina can tell the difference. Second, the burro was FULL of cabbage and not a lot of fish. The salsa was good and flavorful so I used a lot of it to flavor the burro and it brought some good spice to the burro. 

Overall it was just ok. Nothing amazing and nothing I would crave. The real winner was the peach lemonade that comes in slushy form. Yum! 

I would visit Two Hippies again to try their other offerings. The price is good, and the food is ok."}
{"text":"I've only had two hippies twice and let me tell you, it's been amazing both times. The people are nice and friendly and the environment has such a good vibe to it! I like the outdoor seating! Definitely recommend coming here."}
{"text":"Totally worth the food, and even more the environment. Really great place for date or group."}
{"text":"Love coming here. Place seems hectic during the lunch rush but if you place your order over the phone it's so much easier. I don't normally eat here it's always hot since it's mostly outside seating. 

Love their food the shrimp tacos especially. One of my fave spots for shrimp tacos. The fish tacos are really good as well. Those are my to go when I go. If you don't like seafood I probably wouldn't go here. They have steak and chicken but they are def not as good as their shrimp and fish."}
{"text":"Great local shop. I had the bacon cheddar burger which was delicious. Staff were super friendly and brought the food out. Great prices, lots of thick cut fries with the burger. They took credit cards and our orders were prepared in good time even though they are were busy."}
{"text":"I cannot say anything but how Amazing this little place is. It was a franchise spot then the guy decieded to move and handed the keys back over to the origanial owners Andy and Kim.
The food is all fresh made, never sits under a heat lamp, and is made when you order it.
It used to be taco's and burro's mostly, and the price is right on! 5 bucks for a pound size burro of your choice or you can get 3 huge taco's for 5 dollars, the good thing about the taco's is you can mix and match them, that way you can taste 3 diffrent kinds. They also offer a vegitarian section like cactus, black beans and pinto beans, and it is all homeade.
They have daily specials as well, the menu is changing and you can now get any kinda burger{bacon, guac,feta, jalopino ect} with fries for 6 BUCKS..
and then get a yummy flavored lemonade to go with your food the varieties are endless and they are only 3 bucks with a free refill as well, it is so good and kinda slushy, they make them while you wait! plus they pretty much have any kind of soda for a buck or sun tea
I also heard a rumor they will be having breakfast as well soon, cannot wait!!\ so go check it out sit on the wrap around porch and enjoy your day!!!"}
{"text":"Super non-Mexican tacos. Id rather go to taco bell that's how white the tortillas are."}

{"text":"I was so excited when I saw the name of this place as it fits my \"era\". Well, true to form, it was the PERFECT PLACE to have lunch. Came to visit my daughter from Cali. and so we stopped in. WOWSY!  This place is AMAZING!   I had  3 Spicy Shrimp Tacos and they were out of this world tasty!! Serious!  The shrimp was super, and even the Chipotle sauce, and I don't do Chipotle!  You must try it!!!  I will be back before I head home! My daughters Shrimp Burrito was also amazing!! Luv Luv Luv the food and Vintage Hippie Like environment!!"}
{"text":"Huge flavorless portions. Salsa is tomato purée basically. My can of diet coke was fantastic!"}
{"text":"If I could give them 10 stars I would !! First for the BEYOND amazing customer service and second for the food. This is one of the first food spots I tried since moving to the area and they have set the standard very high. If I wasn't happy with the food, I'd sill give them the best rating off of customer service alone. The food was AMAZING and I'm glad I live close because this is definitely a favorite!!!"}
{"text":"So so so so good! What a cool spot. The staff is friendly and helpful. The patio is kept nice and cool. And the tacos were fantastic! Go for the grilled fish. I also had the frozen watermelon lemonade which was super refreshing. 
This was the best meal I had while visiting Arizona."}
{"text":"It wasn't awful, but I wouldn't cross the street to get there.  Carne asada wouldn't make my top 10 list just in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Been there many times with many friends, not fancy food but decent, fresh, local, organic at a good price with none of the pretentions that one would associate with the whole organic/green mocvement in dining. That being said the food only gets 4 stars based on the price plus the 5 star brownies...food is above average but not by much, the atmosphere and price are what i enjoy most"}
{"text":"Probably the best tacos I have ever eaten in my life. I wish I had this close to me because it's probably going to be the last time I enjoy a traditional taco"}
{"text":"Best fish tacos! Grilled shrimp are amazing too but so was the carne asada. Loved it and so cheap too!!"}
{"text":"I happened upon this place when trying to find a place for lunch with a co worker.

This place is phenomenal. Tacos tend to be my go to since you get 3 for $6. My favorite meats are the red Chile beef and pork. Each taco has the perfect amount of rice, bean, meat, cheese and then topped with cabbage and a fresh pico. The loaded quesadilla is awesome too... 

You add the food with great service and you have yourself a wonderful place to eat. !!!"}
{"text":"The best fish tacos in town, period.The atmosphere is awesome and the owner John is a very nice guy."}
{"text":"I have lived in AZ for the past 12 years and visited 8 numerous times a year for 8 years before that.  In all of my dining out experiences, Two Hippies is hands down one of my favorite spots in AZ. The food is not ridiculously gourmet, but it is delicious and you CAN'T beat the price! How many places can you get a filling, tasty meal for less than $10? Two Hippies has and will be one of my all time favorites."}
{"text":"The fried fish tacos with lime. Only. Oh and the surf and turf burrito spicy. So good. Tried the pork taco and the chipotle chicken taco but the fish taco was bomb. I'd only order that taco next time. Guac was good but the chips weren't for me."}
{"text":"My daughter loves this place! Finally, she took me for lunch. Smack in the middle of the hot Arizona heat, but not a problem at all!  Sat under a patio with misters, occupied out time with trivia cards on the table, and admired all the eclectic vintage beach decor.  Love vintage!  

Now to the food.....I ordered 3 fish tacos (happen to be the special of the day). They were absolutely delicious!  I traded 1 taco to my daughter in exchange for 1 of her  carne asada tacos.  Both tacos were so good!  Fish tacos were my favorite!  My other 2 kids had the other special of the day - buffalo chicken burritos, which they modified for their picky eating to just chicken, rice and cheese.  The burrito was toasted on both sides (not greasy at all, just toasted).  Of course I had to try a bit of their burrito.  It was so good!  (didn't have the full fixings: cabbage, and pico but still excellent)

Service was great and quick and friendly.  I even went back to the counter just  to tell them how delicious their food was and chatted for a little bit.  The atmosphere was perfect!  

I am now craving their food!  

They are down the road from Grand Canyon Univ too so all you students head out there.  Support local businesses!!!!!  Affordable and delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Fast food, cute atmosphere! Came on a Tuesday and sat outside, food was normal tacos and quesadillas."}
{"text":"As someone who travels the country for work (all lower 48) I can honestly say these are the best fish tacos in America. John & the crew are great people making great tacos. It's the first place I go to when I get back in town!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Love the guy, he is super friendly and love the food (for what it costs .. 3 huge tacos for $6 even, including tax). 
Yes, the chicken could be a little spicier or red or something but it's not bad at all. 

Tacos come with your favorite meat, beans, onions, chopped cabbage and tomato and melted cheddar cheese. Tacos come (VERY IMPORTANT) individually wrapped in a piece of foil with a (very important too) a fresh and green (not old and brown) wedge of lime. 
I like each taco wrapped individually in a piece of foil because otherwise they will get very messy and wet like those tacos at Chipotle restaurant, I love them but I hate the wet messy tacos Chipotle has).

Any way, tacos come inside a paper brown bag packed with two different salsas on the side (red and green). 

This place has a fabulous outdoor and sadly dusty patio where you can eat your tacos. Imagining yourself sitting in some place in Puerto Vallarta with an ocean view, except, of course, the view here is Camelback Rd. 

They also have dozens of magazines for you to read while waiting/eating your food. I should also point out those magazines are current and not from 1985. I sat next to a Architectural Digest magazine and it's the same issue currently sold at the store right now. 

The only downside of this place is that they do not offer fountain drinks. You must buy a 12oz can of soda or beer. 

If you are a pro like me, you stop at QuikTrip or McDonalds first to buy a large size soda before coming to this place.

{"text":"Great Food served fast and cheerfully on a Sunday night in a town that pretty much rolls up the sidewalks at dusk.
Alright, that's not very fair to Phoenix, I'm sure there is plenty to do in the wee hours of the night if you know where to look and I don't.
Fortunately I noticed Two Hippies Beach House yesterday night and remembered it tonight when I wanted some good food, fast and cheap and fun.
The prices are a solid value, four tacos, chips and salsa, mango lemonade and a bottled water, all for under $14. Plenty of food for two and very filling. Unfortunately they take cash only. Fortunately they have an ATM with a very reasonable dollar fifty service charge right in the building. 
Decor and atmosphere is fun and laid back. Outdoor seating is varied and if you can't find a comfy spot to sit and enjoy your food you are way to demanding.
Four tacos, one Green Beef, one Cactus, one Chicken, and one Carne Asada, were all very tasty. I opted out of the cabbage they use in leu of lettuce (crispness factor) out of consideration for my somewhat picky tummy. The Carne Asada had some gristly and fatty pieces and was overly peppery but still palatable. The green salsa could use a bit more kick. And the chips were fine, nothing to write home about.
Had a chance to speak with the owner since we closed the place down. Mo is a terrific guy who is more than happy to answer questions about his suppliers and general business philosophy as well as his life, family, hobbies and interests. We very much enjoyed talking with him and will check out the other restaurants in the group."}
{"text":"Okay, I'm a firm believer in three strikes you're out.  I gave it two tries, but I couldn't even stomach a third time at this place.  

God!!!!  I sooooooo wanted to love this little quirky place that reminded me of the beach stands in the few remaining un-yuppified beach towns in California. Well, the atmosphere is there, right down to the funny guys that work the place.  

Food is pretty much like music for me, I like all music and I like all food.  I can pretty much find something good in every meal....but not so today.  I take that back...the salsa verde was some of the best I have had.  First try there....wet soggy flavorless fish tacos.

This weekend, I sent my hubby down for a couple of burritos (recommended by yelp reviewers actually), I knew it was a gamble, and I wanted to be able to give a good review, so I picked something everyone said was consistently good.  The green beef burrito.  Hubby had a hot dog of some sort.  Little had a bean, cheese and rice burrito.  

We were 0 for 0.  My burrito....so cold the cheese didn't melt, so big it couldn't even fold and so wet the tortilla melted.  I don't know if it was so disturbing to eat that I couldn't taste it, or if it just had none.  My husband's hot dog grossed me out just at presentation.  He started to make something else and I said, well at least try it, he did and he had to choke it down.  Little has NEVER turned down a bean and cheese but she took one bite and never looked back.  

I want places like this to stick around so bad I'm tempted to print out these reviews and mail them to them.  I'm on a bad review streak.  Gotsta find some good eats soon, maybe Golden Buddah for lunch will turn me around!"}
{"text":"Yum!!

I love running to this place for lunch. Two Hippies Beach House is one of many treasures unique to Central Phoenix. This restaurant is easy to miss as you drive by on Camelback but you will never forget how lovely the atmosphere is once you stop in. The place is very well decorated in a unique fashion that supports the theme of the restaurant. The prices are cheap and the food is great! This place really can make a mean quesadilla. I love the quesadillas here because they offer a wide variety of toppings and meats. My favorite topping is the cabbage. Cabbage on a quesadilla?!?! Yep! It's fantastic! You gotta try it.

Two Hippies is a must!"}
{"text":"I hate to say it, but this is some of the worst Mexican food I've ever had.  Edible?  Sure.  Mexican?  Not a chance.  My hopes were high; with a name like \"Two Hippies,\" I thought it would be a funky little place that served addictive street tacos... (I've never actually had *authentic* street tacos, but I KNOW they're not supposed to taste like THAT.)  

My friend tried the three taco combo; one carne asada, one green chili, and one fish taco - all on the low end of mediocre (though she couldn't even stomach the fish taco).  My burrito tasted like they wrapped bland beans, rice-a-roni, boiled chicken breast, and one ton of chopped onions inside a Mission tortilla.  Don't get me started on the chips and salsa either... Mission and Pace for sure...

The horrible part about all this is that the service was REALLY wonderful!  I think it was one of the owners who served me, and it was probably one of the most pleasant experiences I've ever had service-wise.  She had a distinct Midwestern charm; unfortunately, that's also what the \"Mexican\" food at Two Hippies suffers (severely) from.  

VERDICT: Go to Rosita's or Juan's instead...

(In response to Bryan L's callout:  1)  Yes, I'd take Bertos [or ROSITAS, or JUANS, or Chipotle] anyday over Two Hippies Beach House, and I'm not afraid to say it.  And 2) Everybody [staff and kitchen] speaks English at Two Hippies because they're white as ghosts.  It's like eating at a Chinese restaurant owned and run by Wisconsins.  When English is NOT the primary language of an ethnic restaurateur, to me that's a wonderful sign.)"}
{"text":"I love the vibe, atmosphere, prices, nostalgia. The chips are too salty but the portions are generous and tasty."}
{"text":"Got delivery. Girl was odd and food was disgusting. I got the Monterrey jack & pesto burger and three tacos(fish, carne & chicken) Not good at all!"}
{"text":"We have searched hi and low for tacos - this is the best place by far! Carne and fried fish tacos are the BEST! The staff is just as awesome. Super chill
Place - makes you feel like your hanging out at the beach...only thing missing is the sand! The BYOB is a nice bonus as well!"}
{"text":"OH Dos Hippies....how I wanted to love you sooo much.  

I'd been passing this place by due to the long lines around noon, and just biding my time until I too would get to taste the deliciousness.  I should have waited longer.....

I went in on a Friday around 4:30 and there was no line!  I was so excited!  I perused the simple menu and was delighted to find \"Cactus Tacos\".  This is something I grew up eating, we called it 'nopales', and I'd never seen it on a taco menu.  So I ordered two Cactus Tacos with no cheese.  The very nice chick behind the counter said that the Cactus was prepared fresh daily and mixed with feta cheese.  Okay, I'm not lactose intolarant, just watching calories, so I said that would be fine, just no extra cheese.  She suggested I get three tacos, but I stuck with two, glad I did.  I then paid $1.00 for a can of diet pepsi. $1.00!!!? Get fountain drinks, please.

I waited less than 3 minutes to pick up my tacos from the patio window in the back and sat down amongst a bunch of happily chewing people.  I was excited!

The size of the tacos was great!  I was really happy I only got two, b/c I wouldn't be able to fit in three. I also noticed that there was shredded cheddar on them, even though I'd asked for no extra cheese.  I took off as much as I could and didn't think much about it.  As I picked up the first taco, I thought, 'wow, these seem cold...omg, these *are* cold.'  Who eats cold tacos?  The nopales (prickly pear cactus) were ice cold. ice cold.  The flour tortillas were also cold, the only thing that wasn't cold were the lukewarm pinto beans.  Okay.. I'm half-mexican and will eat a lot of things in a tortilla, almost anything, but I have never been served cold nopales.

Okay, I decided to give it a try, because I'm willing to try anything once. The first bite was crunchy and my intial thought was \"holy crap they didn't clean the cactus of needles!\"  then I realized the crunchiness was merely from the *partially-cooked* rice that was in the taco.  I opened up both tacos, scooped the uncooked rice out and finished them. 

I wanted to like this place so badly!  Why, oh why couldn't you have been amazing?!

I may be too forgiving, but I'm willing to go back and try one of their hot dogs....but give me some time......"}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this place! The concept is great and is always crowded especially with students during lunch time during school year. I had the three tacos for $6! You can't beat that deal with a stick!"}
{"text":"Two Hippies has decent food! I got the chicken burrito, which I found to be tasty! I loved the tortilla that wrapped around the burrito. I also got a side of chips and the green salsa. The chips seemed like they were homemade, but I wish it had more salt to it. I enjoyed that the seating was outside and it was a cozy environment."}
{"text":"I can't believe I've never reviewed this place. I...LOVE...THIS...PLACE... I don't even know where to start. I've tried so much on their menu but I have to think the best is the fish and sweet chili shrimp tacos. These are hands down the best fish and shrimp tacos I've had. EVER. And I order stuff like this everywhere. The green chili beef burrito, the nachos, and quesadilla are all awesome too. And the salsas are amazing. Its a drive for me but definitely worth the trek."}
{"text":"All of my co-workers raved about this place and I finally had the opportunity to try it at lunch.  Wow, this was the most amazing burrito I have ever had.  For me, the flavor was out of this world.  There are other chain restaurants that make burritos that should shudder.  This place rocks.  I have only been two times and am entirely hooked.  the green pork burrito is my favorite so far.  

One piece of advice, if you plan on stopping in for your lunch break (12 p.m.), I would order in advance to save you time in line and waiting for your order.  Seating is all outside, Beach House says it all."}
{"text":"I have wasted so much time driving past this place! Such a great little place with amazing food.

My girlfriend and I really loaded up:

Together: a order (very good amount) of chips and red salsa and a quesadilla

She: 3 fish tacos with cabbage and sauce and a little pico de gallo with a raspberry lemonade to drink.

Me: a fish taco with the cabbage, sauce and pico and a carne asada burrito with pico, rice and beans with a Mountain Dew.

(All together that food was $25! We were stunned! Such great value.)

When we ordered, my girlfriend was asked if she wanted the fish tacos fried or grilled and she said grilled, but received fried.  She didn't mind in the least and from the first bite she was over the moon with how good the tacos were and I have to agree.  They were so delicious and it seems to be what they are well know for.  The sauce had a little more kick to it than I was expecting.  Not a bad thing, just wasn't expecting that heat.

The burrito was massive. So delicious, the only tiny tiny tiny complaint was that either the beans or pico in the burrito had cilantro and I am not a huge fan of the cilantro.  

Overall it was such a great vibe and delicious food.  Before even getting up from the table we had decided that it was our go to Mexican food place.

My girlfriend even ordered a burrito to go for lunch the next day!

Don't drive past this place one more time, without trying it!"}
{"text":"I've had this place a couple of times since have being introduced to it and today I decided to try the Shrimp Bowl with rice and beans topped off with cabbage or lettuce to your liking, cottage cheese, Chipotle sauce, and a salsa of your liking red/green. It was delicious and I seriously recommend having that bowl!"}
{"text":"We had been here when it first opened but haven't been back in awhile.  Not sure why we waited.  It was delicious.  Reasonable prices, great location and hip little vibe.

The people there couldn't be any nicer which lend to a trifecta experience.  Great food, service and value!"}
{"text":"We love this place! Everything is so fresh and yummy! The misted seating area outside is really nice too.."}
{"text":"When some co-workers suggested going to a place called Two Hippies, I wasn't sure what to expect. It sounded fun, so I accepted. I was trying to eat locally after all.

As soon as we pulled up, I noticed the funky decor. I LOVED it!! There was also a large outdoor seating area. You order inside (there was barely room for three of us to be inside at once), and then they brown bag your order and write your name on it. 

Tacos are $3/ea. or 3 for $6. I opted for 3 tacos. I was expecting standard street tacos, but I got so much more. My carne asada tacos came with the standard onion and cilantro, but also had rice, beans, cheese, and cabbage. I wasn't a fan of the cabbage, but the tacos were delicious otherwise.

Canned sodas are $1."}
{"text":"This place gets 5 stars for its overall epicurian badassery.  What more could you ask for - Great service, Amazing prices and wait for it......Brilliant Baja enspired Fish Tacos (Grilled).   The yellow \"Karma Bucket\" really works - toss a couple extra bucks in that baby and watch the goodness flow.  
 
My colleague and I travel to PHX every week for an IT project and we look forward to our weekly \"Hippy Run\" for dinner.  @ John and @ Mike are in the zone with their hospitality and engaging conversations."}
{"text":"Two hippies is a cool place and I definitely recommend checking it out, but it's nothing TOO special. I did feel like the service was a little slow and the food was OK, but this was a couple months ago. I hear management has changed. I've had better and I probably won't come back, but I don't regret at least trying it."}
{"text":"Dude, can you say fish tacos, Cali-beach style?!

I miss the fuck out of this place ever since I moved out to Rancho Cucamonga, California recently. Oh sure, So Cal has good tacos, but to find beach-side tacos here, you gotta go... Well, to the beach! Which in LA traffic, forget about it.

I think the nicest thing about Two Hippies Beach House was how the owners made a daring move setting up a fish taco restaurant in the middle of the DESERT. And somehow not only survived but brought in a huge following of customers!

Whenever I came here I got one of each taco. That's a lot of tacos, considering they've got so many different varieties!

You know a SoCal fish taco place has good tacos when they serve every taco with lime.

Few gripes I have with this place: they put beans in their tacos which is kinda weird for me. Also, you can't buy beer there, but you can bring your own beer, apparently."}
{"text":"I tried the 3 tacos for $6 deal and ordered a soda in the can.  Ordering was easy enough and I got my food pretty fast out the back window.  I might not have known about the rear delivery system if I had not already wondered by it earlier.

I received my tacos, but my soda was missing when they called my name.  I mentioned it to very friendly lady that delivered my food and she promptly got it for me.

I ordered a green meat, a red meat and a chicken taco.  All three tacos came individually wrapped in foil and came in a brown paper bag.  It also came with both green and red sauces.  All three came with soft flour tortilla wrappings. I am not a fan of flour tortillas for tacos because I usually prefer the street style with corn tortillas.  The tables also had El Pato Sauce and another hot sauce for your pleasure, although I am not sure they keep them refrigerated?

The flavor, temperature, and the taste of the meat tacos were fine.  I was surprised to find beans in all 3 tacos, but they added nice texture and flavor.

The green and red meat tacos were pretty good, but did not stand out as something that I would crave on a Saturday night after a few brews.  The chicken taco had huge cubes of white chicken meat.  The chicken drowned out the other flavors in the taco (actually too much chicken).

Overall, a pretty cool eclectic place that I would try again."}
{"text":"Tasty tacos food at wonderful prices. Try the grilled fish taco!"}
{"text":"This is my second time here and I have fallen in love with this place. Food is absolutely delicious. The prices are great. The employees are very friendly. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Fish tacos!!! Don't go here without trying. And I hate fish & seafood. That should tell you everything. Cute little taco place with a California vibe."}
{"text":"My wife and I were out record shopping and stopped in. Very fun place. Patio is shaded with misters so heat wasn't a bother.  My wife loves nachos and she didn't love these nachos. They have the liquid cheese instead of shredded.  I was cool with them.  Wife had shrimp tacos and loved and I hD the spicy shrimp burrito which wasn't that spicy but was delicious.  Definite recommend."}
{"text":"Great service , awesome tacos .!! Super beach feel too it it reminded me of being at the beach eating tacos at rocky point .. Great vibe and I'll be coming back for sure ."}
{"text":"These guys crushed it tonight. I had to make some modifications due to dietary constraints and they were more than accommodating."}
{"text":"Amazing little gem! Best grilled shrimp burrito I've ever had. Full of flavor and toasted on the outside to perfection."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! I love fish tacos and I try them every chance I get. These grilled fish tacos are the best ever! Grilled perfectly with delicious rice and beans covered in amazing sauce. If you're a fish taco fan you MUST try this place. The customer service you receive is exceptional and the dinning area is perfect. So in closing I give them 5 stars"}
{"text":"Love the décor! Love the idea in the middle of hot Phoenix. Even love the randomness of it all.

But, it's just too damn hot to sit outside and eat a hot taco. 
Food is average, for an average price. 
Would you expect more from hippies?
HMMM....let me think.

I will come back here just for the smile the décor puts on my face. 
Just driving past this place makes me grin.

We should all be just a little  HAPPIER!!! and HIPPIER!

*pics"}
{"text":"I like what the Two Hippies brand is trying to do.  Bring a local chain of food at a great price point.  The problem is, they aren't killing it on the product.   If you want to have a dumpy location, with nowhere to sit, and a decent concept, the food better be damn good.

There is no place to sit inside, so I am not sure how this place will make it through the winter.

The food is ok.  Its not terrible, but it doesn't even compare to another mid-town taco shop (America's).  I'm not going to argue if I am taken here, but I will definitely suggest America's over this establishment in a heart beat, even though Two Hippies is closer to both work and home."}
{"text":"Nice joint! (No pun intended, okay maybe a little bit). This place reminds me of back home in California, it could be a place right off of Mission Beach or Hermosa Beach.

They don't have any indoor seating so keep that in mind during the warmer months. They have a 1/2 wrap around patio with misters and on the other side there are picnic tables with umbrellas. 

Okay let's get to the best part, the food. I've tried so many things here that I'm just going to break it up into levels:

GREAT 5/5: Passionfruit Guava Slushie, the Nachos (with grilled chicken), Chipotle Shrimp Taco, and the Chipotle Shrimp Burrito.

GOOD 4/5: Passionfruit Mango Slushie, Loaded Quesadilla, the Fried Fish Taco, Peach Guava Slushie, and the Mango Habanero Taco.

OK 3/5: Guava Mango Slushie, the Spicy Chili Shrimp Taco, the Sweet Chili Shrimp Taco, Spicy Chili Beef Taco, Carne Asada Taco, Green Chili Beef Taco, and the Pomegranate Slushie.

Service is always great, they are helpful and patient when you're ordering and your food comes out relatively quick. Out of the many times I've been here service was only slow once.

The only negative are the close quarters specifically where you order, and the bathroom. I know they're trying to emulate a certain flair but they're still in Phoenix, they should treat themselves to the best of both worlds. Hopefully they'll open it up in the future because it was rather uncomfortable being in such close quarters with so many people, like being on an airplane and waiting for the bathroom. Otherwise, great place!"}
{"text":"I really dig this place. A nice little gem in the mix of all of these low quality spots in Phoenix. I'm not a fan of buffets for obvious reasons and don't like supporting franchised businesses. 

The Pros:

1.  Great food in general. They don't over season their food to mask good flavors. Really nice balance and a nice touch by using cabbage instead of iceberg lettuce. By the way, lettuce has no nutritional value at all. It's a cheap filler used to rip off customers. Cabbage is full of great nutrition and eventually full of farts if you eat too much of it. The burritos are monstrous. I would eat half and then save it for later on in the day. Really great price for good food.

3.  Unique daily specials. It's worth coming back each day to check what they've dreamed up. The daily drinks are flavored with Monin, which is a simple syrup flavoring. So good.

2.  Very friendly staff who keep it simple. Order your food, they write it down on a paper bag, you get your food from the window in the back seating area. There's a good amount of parking as well. If an order isn't up to par just let them know and they'll fix it for you.

4.  I love the decor of this place. It oozes the laid-back vibe of a taco stand. You have no choice but to eat outside in the fresh air instead of inside of a stale place."}
{"text":"3 tacos for $6 is a great deal considering how big the tacos were! They were not my most favorite tacos but definitely worth the occasional stop bye."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for tacos in Phoenix, and now that I've moved away, I really, really miss it!

For just $5 you can get 3 tacos of your choice -- tasty and filling!  My husband can eat all 3, but I barely make it through 2.  The best part is that they use cabbage instead of lettuce, so it makes the whole taco less soggy and more crunchy (though it's made on a soft tortilla).

The ONLY downside is that they accept cash only (but they do have an ATM machine inside).

I'm a casual girl from the NW, so if you're looking for a casual locale, cheap but good tacos, homemade smoothies, and a beer, head over to Two Hippies.  Best in town!"}
{"text":"Mmmmnnn this place was mediocre at best. It's a cool venu but the seating is still pretty limited and the food is nothing special. I had the taco bowl and it was just ehhhh. Pro: they have a bunch of different flavors of lemonade slushies!"}
{"text":"Tacos are the bomb ! Recommend the fish tacos , burritos are OK ... also the vegetarian tacos are great !"}
{"text":"Soooo good! I had the vegetarian burrito with cactus! I was impressed at the simple but very good ingredients. I would definitely try them again in a heartbeat. Super happy to have found this jewel in the middle of such a busy part of the city. I want to try more of their food but I'm afraid they don't have many vegetarian options at the moment."}
{"text":"I didn't even know this place was there until a friend told me after work. I didn't have any expectations at first. The ambiance is super awesome. But, when I got my food. I have to say... the best I have had since I moved here to Phoenix. Service was top notch. I will be eating there more and more, since I am 1 mile away. Fish tacos and shrimp burrito is what I had and it's awesome!! Get a side of the sweet chili sauce... A+++"}
{"text":"Had a craving for fish tacos. I have passed this establishment many times on my way home from work. Figured it was a perfect time to check them out. I ordered 2 fried fish tacos and shared a shrimp  burrito with my bestie. The fish tacos took me back to Rosarito, Mexico. They are so darn good, I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Oh, for the love of Pete !!! I love this place,as soon as you walk in you can smell the smell of taco heaven !! It makes me wanna grab a spliff and stuff my face with tons of tacos  and burritos !! The service is friendly and outstanding!! I got the  and turf & surf burrito and the wife got the loaded nachos!!! Food is out of this world.  The  decor takes you away to a San Diego boardwalk!! Love this place !!"}
{"text":"First time - and will not be our last!!!!  Great fun vibe - felt like I was on vacation!  The food was fantastic and the service was great as well.  I understand its under new ownership - I hadn't been here before but the tacos I had were fresh, the homemade chips were perfect - overall great, casual, fun place to grab a quick bite to eat!"}
{"text":"I'm slowly but surely finding some of the good local(ish in this case) business in the northern Phoenix area.  Two Hippies is one of the winners.

First impressions - man this place is small!  A total of five tables is barely enough to hold the lunchtime rush - in fact, people were standing all over the place.  We were lucky enough to snag a table while waiting for our food and we felt like VIPs.

The first impression I had was that the menu was really diverse.  Tacos, burgers, and hot dogs is an interesting combo; but even within those food groups there were a lot of different choices.

Tacos were $2 each or 3/$5 - a great deal given how big they are.  There are a lot of options including chicken, fish, a few types of beef, and even cactus.  The hot dogs included things like feta and pesto mayo.  

I ordered the chicken and fish tacos, and to be a little adventurous threw in a cactus taco.  All of them were way bigger than I thought they'd be, and the cactus was amazingly good.  It was sprinkled with some Feta cheese and various other veggies.

Two important things - CASH ONLY and no tax!! $5 is $5 when you rock the Hippy palace."}
{"text":"My husband and I just went here for the first time, the food was delicious!!!! We had three different items and all three were completely different tasting! We will definitely be going back! Also the service was great, they were helpful, attentive, and friendly!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been wanting to check out a  Two Hippies joint for quite some time, but it's usually after we just ate somewhere else. Today, we were out running errands and got hungry so decided to come here. I'm glad we did!

I had the pesto-mayo/feta/etc hot dog. It was delicious, and they put two dogs in a bun, so it's a ton of food. I've been jonesing for a good hot dog ever since Maui Dog closed, and this will probably be a good replacement for it! They throw in a little bag of chips too, I got regular Sun Chips, but my boyfriend stole them from me.

I also had a frozen lemonade, with passionfruit. First taste and it reminded me of another thing I miss dearly, Fruitopia!

My boyfriend had just a plain hot dog. He got ketchup and mustard for it too. He enjoyed it, but I think he secretly liked my dog better. He got FunYuns as his chip choice, but regretted it so I ended up eating them.

All in all, $10 spent on a good amount of food.

You can BYOB there too, which is awesome. I think next time we go we'll be bringing some kind of drank. :)"}
{"text":"I normally love this place and recommend them to everyone. Today my order was messed up and when I called about it the guy sounded like he didn't care. Which sucks because I'm big on customer service. Bad experiences get shared fast."}
{"text":"Stoner Hoagie...need I say more.  The Hippies got it right for sure!  This sandwich is off the charts deliciousness.  You ever order something and think, oh I'll just eat it in the car....not really an option here...I had to pull over.  And every morsel was a delight.  I couldn't quite decide if the toasted buttery roll was my favorite or wait maybe the feta cheese atop the mouth watering carne asada or the pesto mayo..or perhaps all of it.  I chose the potato salad for my side, and I'm ever so fortunate that I did.  They rock it...the bacon bits are just a super added bonus!!  This sandwich is ***** and then some!"}
{"text":"Fantastic! Has a real beachside feel, in the heart of Phoenix. The price point is probably the best part, but the value is that the food is delicious. Love the ambiance, a perfect blend of a simple concept of beachside tacos shop and great food. Only thing missing was the sound of the waves! Gets an A+ from me!"}
{"text":"First time trying the restaurant.  Chips and salsa are extra charge. I had shrimp  taco and rice bowl. The   hips were a little  thick . The volcano  sauce  was hot but no flavor. The guacamole  was ok. The chicken in the rice bowl was tough. We also had the shrimp  burritos  which was their best meal. Service was good"}
{"text":"I've heard of the Magic Mushroom joint, but this came at me out of left field.  I decided to hit this shack with a work bud of mine (Groovy P.) to check it out.  The first thing I noticed (other than the wonderfully tacky decor) was the decent prices.  Tacos are $1.50 each (tax included).  I went with the Burro.  Honestly If they would have named the place Two Hippies and a Burro, I would have enjoyed myself more.  But Beachhouse is fine too, I guess.

The guy taking orders is the owner himself.  He owns the Magic Mushroom place down on Indian School too.  I think its refreshing to have the owner taking orders.  Owners know how to do it right!  He asked me my first name and scribbled it onto a brown bag. NOW I'm diggin this place!  He was calling regulars up with nicknames like Snowman Steve, and Sarge.  I wanna be a regular to find out what awesome alter-persona he labels me.  Knowing my luck, he'd name me Conehead Chris or Corporate Chris or something else I wouldn't like. I wanna be Snowball Steve!

The wait was long. 25 minutes long! Standing around staring at other people waiting. *Check watch* shuffle feet *Check watch*... Then I hear \"CHRIS!!! PATIO PICKUP!\"  Wtf?!?! Wheres the patio?

So I get my food and scarf it down.  Carne Asada... not spiced for a typical burrito... Cabbage??? To say the least, it was pretty damn good.  For $4, you can't go wrong!  Next time I'll just get 2 tacos...

I'll be back, Mr. Hippy..."}
{"text":"Drive by this place all the time and decided to get lunch. Bomb carne asada burrito and loaded quesadillas. The guy working the counter was helpful. And the slushs are awesome also."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE Two Hippies Beach House. I've been there many times and have yet to be disappointed. Their fish tacos are the best. I love the atmosphere. One of my favorite places to visit is the beaches in California and this place has that beach front feel to it. I hope they last many years. One of my favorite places to visit."}
{"text":"Sorry, don't agree with most of ya yelpers on this place. 

I wanted to stop by this place for awhile, so Sunday I took the trip down here to see what some of the fuss was all about. Cheap good food drew me in, and I'm a sucker for fish tacos. I drove up to this place thinking yes, this does look like a hippies house, with all the misc. crap placed all over the walls, ceilings and windows. I wouldn't say it had much of the beach vibe I think they were going for, or maybe it's just me, I have lived most of my life in San Diego and near the Beach, and most little beach shacks I've been to have a different vibe to them. 

On the board it said something like famous fish taco's or something like that. I thought oh yes then, got to try those.. I really don't know why I insist to challenge my gut feeling of \"don't order the fish taco's, your in the middle of the freakin desert, there is no ocean for hundreds of miles\", but no.. I had to order them. Taco's were cheap, like $2 a piece. 

The guy working at the counter that took our order was super friendly, he took the time to ask us how are day was going and what have we been up to and stuff. We waited about five minutes and our order was up. While waiting I was looking around at all the mess that was placed everywhere, and was wondering how this tied into there \"theme\".   And I wonder how long it's been since this place has gotten a good scrub, or at least a dusting???

OK, our order was up, and we sat in the back on some picnic benches. It was hot, but they did have a huge fan that made it bearable to sit back there. We opened up our fish taco's and noticed, wow these are huge! They piled all sorts of stuff in there.. cabbage, rice, ton's of cheese, fish, some sort of secret sauce, all on a flour, kinda thick shell (taste like the mission brand). 

Grabbed the taco with both hands and bit into the taco. Blahhhh, it was the fish.. Oh man, the fish killed it.. taste so fishy and soggy it was gross. Next, don't ask me why I did it, but I thought I'd try it again. So I poured the red hot sauce they had given on it and tried it again.. Blahhhh, gross, gross, gross. The sauce didn't help at all. There sauce had no heat to it, and the fish was just as bad as the first bite. I had bought two taco's, and looked in back of me, and there were two guys in there 20's macking down on taco's, and I offered them our taco's we didn't eat. They said, no man.. where good. So I couldn't even give these away for free.. 

We drove off grossed out, and I had this fishy taste in my mouth for about 20 minutes before I had to stop and get something else to eat to get the taste out. Soda wasn't doing the trick. I remember saying to my husband in the car driving off, I don't feel good, I think I'm going to puke.. really my stomach hurt, and in no way do I have a sensitive stomach. Like others had said, I really did want to like this place, but no way I'll ever ever return. Sorry.."}
{"text":"Yum. Have been wanting to stop here so many times and finally got a chance to for lunch today. My husband ordered some tacos and I got the special, a teriyaki chicken burrito. The employees were extra friendly, wanted to make sure we were happy with everything...which I absolutely loved. Their food recommendations were awesome, I loved my burrito and my husband loved his fish tacos. We can't wait to come back and this time we are bringing the kids!"}
{"text":"Service was great. Nice little spot . We were driving by and hubby asked me lets try the place. Food was ok, but could be better. The shrimp taco was awesome. Was not to fond of the beans added to the carne asada taco."}

Really fresh ingredients! Wish they weren't out of the blood orange lemonade, but the acai lemonade was really good too!"}
{"text":"Eating here for the first time by by daughter's recommendation. 
Good fish tacos. 3 for $6
I usually am not a fan of tilapia - but these were good. 
Volcano hot sauce is the best!
Cool decor - love the hippie theme. 
They say their shrimp tacos are the best. We will try those next time."}
{"text":"I love The Beach House!!! Best fish & shrimp tacos in AZ by far. Plus they have really good frozen lemonade that hits the spot in the summer time. The owner John is super cool as well!"}
{"text":"Went to this place with my kids cause we thought it looked cool, tried it. It was horrible.  Tacos look like dog meat or some sorta dog food, not carne asada, and the chicken in my torta was some sort of canned chicken,  almost mistaked it for tuna cause of the almost similar smell and texture.  I'm really big at eating/shopping at small and local business and restaurants cause that's where you always get the good stuff, but gotta tell yeah I was really disappointed when I came to this place. 16 bucks for 3 tacos that went in the trash and a torta along with a mediocre hot dog and drinks. Never coming back here again. My fingers still smell like the meat in the torta."}
{"text":"Two Hippies is hands down my favorite lunch spot in central Phoenix. The fried fish tacos are among the best I've ever had! The atmosphere is also mellow and relaxing. If you sit in the back with the misters and close your eyes, you can almost successfully convince yourself you're at the beach.

Don't be put off if you see a line out the door when you arrive - it always moves quickly. Seriously, the staff are rockstars!"}
{"text":"This place is exceptional!! The fried fish tacos are glorious and today i had their spicy shrimp taco for the first time and it was MAGICAL!! Been here several times and the food is excellent every time!!"}
{"text":"A wonderful local taco shop with a distinct hippy/geeky hybrid vibe! You will have no trouble finding this place, it really stands out on Camelback with its funky design - look for the VW bus and a beach-style patio; inside you will find comic books and a cool figurine of Spock.
But onto more important things - food & service! 
Service - can't complain. It's always the same two people, and the girl who takes orders is really friendly and cool. I don't normally use words like \"cool\" in reviews, but here it is apt. This place is trendy and hip, without being hipster and tacky. The staff just comes off as the type of people you would be friends with and hang out with. It's counter service, so you really can't ask for more than a friendly intelligent face behind the counter, and Two Hippies are super rad people! 
The food: I've sampled the menu, having the burritos, nachos, tacos etc... They were all good, but there is really one item that keeps me coming back time after time: the fried fish taco.
One of the best I have ever had in my life. That good. 
For about $3 you get a huge piece of nice fried fish, and the toppings are perfectly balanced with the fish. The sauce is tasty - no tartar on this. 
While I recommend trying anything on the menu (caveat - the nachos were really disappointing)... I feel that the fried fish taco is a MUST HAVE. They are highly addictive, and you will forget you are not in San Diego or Puerto Penasco.....
If you want to go to a really fun place, with super cool staff, and the best fish taco you will have in Phoenix.... Two Hippies on Camelback is a treasure to be discovered!"}
{"text":"The staff here are really friendly.  They even opened a little early for us, because we showed up without knowing the hours.  The food is great!  I have been here 3 times and I have not been disappointed yet."}
{"text":"Oh boy! The fish tacos are amazing.  For a very small price you get a very large amount of fresh and delicious food. This is one place a teenager and adult can agree has fabulous food. If you are a Republican don't be scared away by the name or the color scheme.  The food is worth getting even if it looks a little, um, unconventional.
The parking is free and the staff are very friendly."}
{"text":"Ran across this place while running errands today.  I felt like I was in Newport Beach or something.  Got the 3-pack tacos for $5:  what a deal!  The owner, Andy, came out to welcome us and ask how everything was.  Very friendly guy, and funky little neighborhood place. They use mostly AZ products and try to go organic for their produce which is a big plus.  Check it out if you head over that way."}
{"text":"Holy. Effing. SHIT! These tacos are so amazing that I went back twice within 24 hours. Oh, and I ate a total of 7 tacos... 

On my first visit, I ordered two and was so mind blown that I went back and got two more after I swallowed those... which left me uncomfortably full, but NO REGRETS. Worth every bite. So naturally, I returned the next day and compromised between my 2 total tacos and 4 total tacos with 3. If I could eat these every day, I probably would. My psychotic food loving brain is trying to figure out how to get 300 shipped to Boston in a way that I could freeze them and then eat them every day. Haven't figured out a way to make that happen, but hit me up if you have some ideas ;)

I tried 6 different tacos during my trips: mango shrimp, green chili beef, fried fish, chicken, pork... and I somehow can't remember the last. All of them were AMAZING! Honestly couldn't choose one that I didn't like if I tried.

If you're in town and you don't go here, you're making the worst mistake of your life, I swear."}
{"text":"Best Fish tacos I've ever had hands down. Don't let any of these other reviews fool you. This is a diamond in the rough. These People are down to earth, friendly and make excellent food. I will go here every time I'm in the Camelback area! So tasty!"}
{"text":"This place is freakin phenomenal! I go there once a week sometimes. It is not necessarily close to my work, but my co-workers and I dont mind the drive!!! Their pork tacos are by far the best. Sometimes there are some random specials, and the chicken ones are ok. Besides, 5 bucks for 3 tacos? Yes please!"}
{"text":"Three taco's for $6, and that's the every day price. ;-)

I've had Two Hippies Beach House about three times now and there's just something about them that doesn't quite sit right. I want to love them for the $6 / three tacos meal, but my GI system seems to say otherwise. I've had different combinations of tacos here with varying success, and since I'm no masochistic I must gracefully withdraw my name from ballot for \"Duke of the Beach House.\" - no write in's, please.

Maybe it's the enourmose portions per taco, or perhaps the combination of spices used when cooking the beef. Maybe it was the rice, or extra sliced jalepenos I always ask for. Either way, the food had a good taste, and a great price, but just doesn't agree with my sensitive 'personality'; I guess. :-/

Alas, I live to fight the good (food) fight in this ever lasting battle.

Happy Yelping Phoenix."}
{"text":"Had 3 tacos grilled fish, green chili beef, chipotle chicken for $6. My Favorite was the chipotle chicken. Great price and great quality, definitely would have again!"}
{"text":"This little taco shop with an old school west coast vibe creates fresh tacos with lots of varkety. With the price of 3 tacos for around $6, you're wallet and your stomach can be happy. Not only that they have a bunch of smoothies and drinks to pair with your wonderful fish tacos or loaded quesadilla."}
{"text":"I had a few carne asada tacos. Very delicious, super fresh and they also put a good amount of meat in there. Great customer service. The vibe they had in and around the restaurant was chill and interesting. Recommend!"}
{"text":"Great place to get your Mexican food fix.  Casual but quick.   Fun outdoor seating and place to eat, chat and chill."}
{"text":"I am a wee bit obsessed with here. Ive only eaten one thing and it's the fish taco. I eat one bc one is enough. One time I came very late right before closing and some of the rice was hard and I almost threw up but I still like this place."}
{"text":"DO NOT even attempt to go here for lunch during the week between 11:30-1:00. There are Xavier kids EVERYWHERE. 

You know what, just stay off Camelback all together. You've been warned."}
{"text":"Fish Tacos are good and the Acai Lemonade is my favorite! YUMMYYY"}
{"text":"Fresh food in a fun atmosphere. The fish tacos were delish! I personally did not care for their carne asada taco but my date loved them. All tables are outdoors but they put a lot of effort into making it like a beach taco stand. Perfect for a fun date"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch a couple weeks back and told myself I would write a review...i completely forgot! :( But today I drove by it and it reminded me to write a review. 

First thing is...Value.....You get a ton of food....for basically nothing....they have daily specials that are always good but their burritos that can stuff a horse are like 3$....Be warned however that they dont tell you this....so when you order a burrito and 3 tacos because you think it cant be much food due to the low price......you'll know. 

I got a burrito with pork and it was delicious...too many beans for me but thats easily correctable next time....by time I got half way...I knew there was no way I was getting to taste the \"famous fish tacos\" if I kept going. So I stopped with the burrito and moved on to the fish tacos....yum...they were very good....I still prefer the burritos..but as a lighter meal you can do the tacos and be very full and very happy. Again...beans were a bit much but Ill just ask for light beans next time. 

They also make these flavored lemonade slushis there that are pretty tasty. 

All in all a very friendly place with friendly owners who live up to the name of the place and they make great food for VERY affordable prices. 

When I was there they were Cash Only...I dont know if that has changed...but bring cash just in case."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!! The owner John and his staff are so friendly, and really get to know their customers! Everything is super fresh and packed full of flavor! I have yet to order anything that doesn't exceed my expectations. Their shrimp tacos are THE BOMB, and my entire salon is ecstatic there served daily now!"}
{"text":"Always delicious!! Great food, great service and great fish tacos! Can't beat the environment and its BYOB approved. Owner is always there to greet people with a friendly face too; can't beat that!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Affordable. Filling. Fresh ingredients. BYOB

All the makings for a great place. Crazy busy during lunch time (noon) but expected with Xavier down the block and businesses to west. Small menu that makes what they cook, turn out incredible. Fresh cold lemonades are refreshing on a warm PHX day. New favorite go to spot."}
{"text":"Another great Two Hippies concept!  We stopped by a few weeks ago to grab a quick dinner and loved it.  My hubby had the rice bowl and I had the fish tacos...delicious!  I also enjoyed an icy pineapple lemonade...so delicious and refreshing on a hot day (comes with a free refill too - bonus!).  The staff was so super friendly and welcoming to our dog who joined us on the patio."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great prices and fantastic ambience. We have definitely found our new fav lunch spot!"}
{"text":"Went for my first time last night, and it blew the roof off of my expectations. The incredible ambiance/scene draws you in (not to mention the BYOB sign) and its the service and food that will bring me back for a long, long time. I asked for suggestions and without missing a beat was recommended one of the specials, the Thai Peanut Shrimp Burrito. One of the most incredible burritos I have ever had, the taste was unique, complex, and a new type of delicious from the first bite to the last. My girlfriend ordered Fish tacos with a Mango-Habanero sauce. Simple, filling, and tasty as well! We were both incredibly satisifed, and such cheap prices...? Cmon! It doesnt get much better."}
{"text":"I absolutely love their fried fish tacos. So very tasty, and they're a hefty size for what you're paying! I haven't gotten anything else just because I'm so in love with them.

The decor is lots of fun. Succulents, concert posters, vinyl record sleeves, vintage artwork, Trivial Pursuit at each table. Just beware that parking can be a pain, depending on the time of day. There is a neighborhood to park at nearby, but it'll be a short walk. 

The staff is very friendly. I've never had problems calling in an order."}
{"text":"I made my second trip here over the weekend, though a little hesitant seeing as it was noon on a Saturday.  The line was a little long, but moved suprisingly fast.  The concept is great, and the prices are well worth what you get.  Having just finished a hike I felt I could down a 3 pack for tacos ($4.50) and probably could have, but I cut myself off at 2 1/2.  The tacos have a unique mix of cabbage, onion, beans, (and more) that may not sound like they go with a taco, but when all put together they do.  The outdoor seating could be not so great come summer, but for now it's great and I will definately be back again!"}
{"text":"finally! the place slowed down a bit to stop in for a quick bite. it was MLK day, so i thought the crowd would be obsolete, NOT SO! it slowed for a minute, kinda like the waters parting, and then as i placed my order, and had a chat with Andy, the line swelled up again!!!! He said its all been done organically, no advertising, just word of mouth. Must be the BIG A_S tacos. They are litterally bursting with food. I tried the 3 pack of fish tacos. The fish was tender and delicious, however the rice and beans inside the taco was a new twist (next time that goes on the side!) that is where the filling comes from. I'm more of a fish, lettuce, cheese, salsa and lemon fish-taco-kinda-girl so the place only got a 3. However i'm sure on my second visit, the one where there won't be any rice or beans in my taco, will be a deliciously heaven like trip. If your a salsa freak (like my seester & I) this salsa is not for you. neither the green or red is tasty or hot, think salsa for americans.

 its so close to my place too! kudos on the local, glad the previous boutique moved (otherwise where would this tiny all inclusive place be?)

on a side note; the owner and his bro are the creators of Long Wongs Wings and Hippy Brother Burgers and they still have it!!! The place is a kitschy place. You go Andy ^_~ hope they come to Grand Avenue soon......"}
{"text":"I finally wound up at Two Hippies for tacos the other day after living within a stone's  throw for a few months. Whenever I go to a place for tacos, I'm expecting one of two things... either mass quantities of grub on the cheap or in-your-face quality and flavor. Two Hippies Beach House takes care of the former. The service was friendly, and the chow is okay, not bad, but not outstanding in the slightest. It's truly perfect as a quick and filling meal that you can mow down with a few friends before going out to the bar or for when you are getting back from the bar. And that, to me, has it's own special place in the restaurant food chain. For $5 flat I can walk away with three giant tacos loaded with plenty of ruffage to extinguish my appetite. Throw in some green salsa with those tacos and I'm content. There's no doubt that I'll be back soon enough."}
{"text":"Been here 2x now and it's been great both times!! The 3 tacos for $6 is the best deal for a cheap and quick lunch in downtown. The staff is always super friendly and I love the outdoor patio seating. Cute little family friendly place, and the food is amazing!"}
{"text":"Shrimp tacos blew me away. Efficient friendly service....looking forward to another Friday opportunity."}
{"text":"Fun corner stop with a great atmosphere. Excellent food for the price. You can also bring your own beer and enjoy the funky patio."}
{"text":"My wife and I went there for the first time this past weekend and were pleasantly surprised. The portions were large enough that we were able to split a burrito and both walk out full. The prices were reasonable, especially if you're splitting a meal ($5 for a burrito). The employees were nice and overall we had a great meal. Definitely plan on going again."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness... This place has the best fish tacos in AZ. Its not only the fish tacos but everything else is super yummy. I honestly tried a couple places in AZ and nothing beats this place. Super friendly service. Must try the volcano sauce, boy it blew me away."}
{"text":"Ok, first of all this place is so cute! I felt nostalgic walking into this small, perfectly place taco shop. They only have outdoor seating but it's perfectly decorated like a beach stand taco shop. The staff was friendly and helpful!  Prices are great. Sides are not included. I got the shrimp and fried fish tacos. Both spectacular but I must say the fish taco was out of this world. They gave me salsa on the side but these tacos don't need it, they are perfectly saucy! Must try!!"}
{"text":"I came here with some coworkers today for lunch and this place is awesome. Friendly staff and awesome food. Only thing I hate is the parking and how squeezed in everyone is because the restaurant is so small. I had the rice bowl with green chili beef. Delicious. I will be back"}
{"text":"I love this place with all my heart. I have been going here for four years and get the same thing every time (carne asada burro). I will always come here when I am looking for a convenient bite to eat, fast service, friendly people, and DELICIOUS food (emphasis on the delicious part). The prices don't break the bank either! I don't know what I am going to do when I am away at college, might have to order some very expensive Postmates hehe"}
{"text":"I REALLY wanted to like this place.  The cute cashier boy and the fun little stand was a great start; however, the tacos were another story.  I ordered the fish taco and the carna asada taco with green chile.  My tortillas were falling apart from the grease and from the large quantity of the meat, cheese, and cabbage.  That was not too bad but the flavor or the tacos were just plain salty.  So salty that I really couldn't enjoy the beef in my taco.  I tried the fish taco and the fish was \"sick\" as in not well, and ill.  That's what I call fish when they have this fishy smell that's beyond the normal fish smell.  I know my fish, trust me (I'm Asian okay) and the fish in my taco was just not right.  

Granted the tacos were cheap and the quantity was large; however,  I rather pay more and eat a fish taco that is \"not sick.\""}
{"text":"If Castle boutique and camelback were not at the front door I would have never known that I was in Phoenix.  Seems like something right out of Baja.  This place reminds me of some of the dive places that I have been in Mexico on the beach.  So if you are looking for Fast Food at reasonable prices that tastes great you should check it our.  Best part is that you don't need the Imodium after the meal like in Mexico.  

The day that I went had a green chicken taco special and I hope that stays one the menu.  I liked it much better then the bean and cheese or carne asada taco.  They also have a great selection of lemonade with flavors that I have never heard.  Make sure to bring cash... that is all they take!"}
{"text":"I miss this in Phoenix, incredible food! The ambiance is fun and it's somewhere you can just chill at. It is a great place to bring friends and the food is just awesome. I don't necessarily like the location, it's right off the street on camelback in PHX."}
{"text":"This place is my partner and I's go to. The fish tacos are so good. All the food is fresh and made right there when you order it. We dig it a lot. We go there at least once a week."}
{"text":"This joins my long list of places that I really want to love, but ...

I love the atmosphere. I love what they SAY they stand for. I love the concept of two hippies dropping out and dropping back in as restaurateurs.

What I don't love is the food. The chicken and fish tacos I had were bland. No flavoriing. Thank god they had hot sauce (not homemade, store bought) on the table to spice things up a bit.

On a positive note, the prives were good and the salsa they serve with store-bought chips wasn't bad. And the lemonade (they were out of most flavors both times I visited) was good. 

But overall, maybe it's time for the hippies to clean up their act. Worry about the food a little more than the message."}
{"text":"Tacos were definitely a decent size - green salsa was flavorful. I had the grilled fish and fried fish tacos. Super delicious and worth going back. Prices were just as good and reasonable unlike other \"taco\" places in the area. Can't wait to visit their other locations :)"}
{"text":"Fun little beachy taco stand here in Phoenix. My friends and I have been wanting to try this place forever and we finally did which we thoroughly enjoyed. Everyone was very friendly and extremely nice while we were ordering. There are a bunch of tables that good give vibes and it makes you feel like you are somewhere you right next to the beach. 

I tried the carne asada and grilled fish taco - both were very tasty. I didn't know there was rice and beans already on them otherwise I would have held off on them. Other than that, I really enjoyed Two Hippies and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Well, when your expectations are about as low as they can be, it's easy to be pleasantly surprised. The other Two Hippies on 7th Ave in Melrose Plaza left such a bad taste that I couldn't bring myself to try this one. But eventually my longing to be on a beach in Mexico tempered with a bad economy drove me to try. It was good. Quite fun ambiance. I was glad I didn't go during a peak time because where you order is claustrophobic. But 3 tacos for $5 filled to the brim AND vegetarian options made it worth it. The biggest surprise was the free refill on the yummy fruit lemonades. $16 for 6 tacos, two lemonades (and refill), chips and salsa was a scream. As hungry as I was I couldn't finish all 3 tacos. Good stuff. The boys working were delightful!"}
{"text":"Nice little franchise.  Cute.  Friendly.  Food tastes nutricious.  Very inexpensive.  

But honestly, the food tastes uncooked... bring it home and microwave it."}
{"text":"Out and about exploring and saw this little place.....i had to stop and have their fish tacos....they were fantastic !  I'm glad I stopped.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"We happen to be here on a warm October (yes, I said warm! lol) visiting our son and baby cousin in college.  The surf shack in the middle of a desert will catch your eye immediately!  I love all the memorabilia.  The staff was awesome.  Very friendly.

It was warm and sitting outside in the heat with not even a slight breeze made it a rough first time experience.  

I don't know if their fridge was down, but we were served slightly cooled canned sodas out of a cooler and the salsa that came out of the little soda fridge on the counter was starting to turn. It kept exploding out of the mustard squirter container.  

The food was on point.  The tacos and burgers were good, but we couldn't fully enjoy it because we were sitting there sweating.

If you don't sitting outside in the heat, you'll get the most out of your Two Hippies experience if you visit in the Phx winter (which I plan on doing next week).  

All in all though, good food, chill atmosphere.  I'd definitely go back.  Just not when its hot. lol"}
{"text":"Just ate there at the suggestion of a local since I'm from out of town...it was very tasty, super cute atmosphere even in ridiculous heat. BUT!! Even though the taste was there (at least for the price) I had a hard time getting over 1) the hair in my cactus taco and 2) the fingernail in my fish taco. So..two strikes, so two stars."}
{"text":"Been to this place 3+ times, and I don't know another way to say it - This place is beautiful.  If Two Hippies Tacos was a woman, I'd marry her.

First timers: Get the 3 tacos for $5 deal (I highly recommend the fish tacos), sit out on the back patio on one of the painted picnic tables and indulge. 

Second timers, get a Carne Asada burrito.  You'll thank me later."}
{"text":"First time here. Lube the hippy vibe. 
Ordered 3 Travis, one carne, chicken and one fish. Carne rocks, fish was gross way fishy and still undecided on the chicken. Big tacos, comes with beans, cabbage, rice and cheese. I skippted the cheese.
Eating as I write. ..the chicken doesn't have much flavor. Three green sauce helps however. The ingredients are definitely fresh and the tortilla is very fresh, fluffy and beautiful."}
{"text":"We stopped here while visiting from Chicago.  Every taco we tried was delicious and the sauces are homemade."}
{"text":"I have to start off on a good note. .  the meat fillings in my tacos were tender and seasoned beautifully . .   enough said . . my taco was a slimy mess. . the FLOUR tortillas were drenched and turned doughy and nasty.   Upon returning inside to see if i could remedy the situation I was met with an impromptu line and had to wait ten minutes to get a corn tortilla and a fork.   Come on now. . . can you make a fork accessible to your patrons?   So I informed the young girl at the counter i was unhappy with the tortillas and she pointed to a VERY SMALL sign that said corn tortillas now available. . woohoo   We are in Arizona for Christ's sake . . tacos normally come in corn tortillas. . . flour should be the second choice.  So she charged me for a couple corn tortillas that were old and dry . . they tore in two when i folded them. .  So upset with my experience i folded my soggy mess up and discarded it.   and  I HATE to waste food."}
{"text":"Stopped in after arriving in Phoenix. Don't let the line deter you. It goes by quick! We had the fish tacos and cactus tacos. I felt both tacos lacked in flavor but have enormous potential. Thankful for vegetarian items!!! If I ever find myself in the area again, I will be back!"}
{"text":"DH & I had the tacos had 3 tacos...carne asada, fish, and chicken, fish was probably the best. The tacos were good, but the meat on its own had no flavor. We also had a burrito, which we didn't enjoy, we left most of it."}
{"text":"Loved the service and the food. This place is the coolest little spot for locals to relax and have some tacos. Fun environment!!!"}
{"text":"What a nice little treat . We stopped by the \"Shack\" to give the Hippies a try. 
We instantly enjoyed the decor and feel  of the place. Quaintness abounds, funky posters, kitschy  knick knacks  and  bright colors give it a groovy feel. While not someplace I would bring the whole family this is a good place to stop for a quick bite or a snack.  This is not a sit down eating establishment , you go in place your order ( try the three taco combo)   and then wait outside. There are picnic tables , stools and pub stools around the outside to sit at. It was a clear beautiful day so very nice. 

The hubby and  I   tried  pork, chicken and beef tacos which were all fresh and tasty.Tacos and  burritos were on fresh flour tortillas and had cheese, tomatoes, and lettuce and great spices. My husband also ordered a fish burrito which was ginormous  and he swore it  was over a pound . We also got cans of soda and ate all this for 11.00  not bad. No soda on tap.

I must mention that the owner( ?)  made us feel right at home and was super nice and even funny. His attitude was a big plus and made the eating more enjoyable. It was easy to see he enjoys his work ."}
{"text":"2/17/17 -  My first time and I ordered 2 fried fish tacos and 1 shrimp.
I would give the fried fish tacos 4 stars
I would give the shrimp taco 2 1/2 stars 

2/24 - 2 weeks in a row. Today I ordered 1 fried fish taco and a pork rice bowl (chipotle mayo on the side) 
The fish taco tasted even better than last week 4 1/2 stars 
As far as the pork bowl, I didn't care for the pork at all, but let me tell you the flavor of those pinto beans were on point. The pinto beans get 5 stars

2/25 - YES 2 days in a row....fried fish tacos were delicious as always! I ordered a chicken loaded quesadilla and I should have known better. The chicken looks SUSPECT, but against my better judgement I ate it. I was sick as a dog. NEVER AGAIN!!! The quesadilla was soggy from the guacamole and chipotle being inside. Lesson learned I will stick to ordering the fried fish tacos and a meatless rice bowl! 

3/10 - 2 fried fish tacos - always delicious 4 1/2 stars 
Rice bowl without meat, I was a little disappointed the pinto beans didn't have the amazing flavor like the first time I had them. So....with that being said I'm just going to stick you the fried fish tacos! 

The customer service is always  friendly and professional 5 stars"}
{"text":"Fun place! Very friendly staff, trivial pursuit cards on the tables, all outdoor seating, great ambiance. I had the grilled fish tacos, very good and inexpensive."}
{"text":"There are few places that are delicious hole in the wall chains.  In fact there really are no hole in the wall chains except Two Hippies and they do it right.  Upon entering two hippies you will see all kinds of crazy decor like a twister mat on the ceiling, chairs... on the ceiling, etc.  Your food options consist of Burgers, Hot Dogs and Tacos, where as your beverage choices consist of regular stuff like various sodas to flavored tea and lemonade.  The flavored tea and lemonade is AMAZING, the flavor in the flavored teas is so good you don't even need to add sweetener, that's impressive.  The food is equally as delicious, I had 2 tacos one was fish (not fried, baked tilapia -so good and healthier) and green beef, they have a red beef and green both are cooked with different peppers and marinades,  The green beef was amazing I'm def. looking forward to trying the red beef as well as the \"cactus\" taco which is just insane sounding.  Two thumbs up, bring cash though because that's all they take :)"}
{"text":"I have seen this place a few times and we decided to stop on Friday night.  The décor is comforting and inviting.  I grew up in So Cal and love the vibe.  Yay.  The man at the counter was very nice and helpful.  I ordered nachos and asked him to order me his favorite taco.   Mt partner ordered a bean and cheese burrito with cabbage.  

We sat outside and the weather was fantastic!   We had fun trivia cards on the table and there was plenty to look at to keep us occupied until our order came.

The burrito was very large and my nachos and taco were huge too.  Everything tasted pretty good.  More toward the middle than the great tho.  The raw onions in everything was the most offensive part.  Not sure if we just missed that on the menu or if they just put raw onions on everything.  

Over all, the price was right, the ambiance was nice, the service was great and we had a goodtime.  Was the food amazing?  No, but it was decent.  We will definitely go back and try a few more things and remember to ask them to hold the onions.  

We will be back ;)"}
{"text":"This place is special!  

Okay, you have to know the password to get in.  The guy at the door doesn't remember what it is, but if you promise not to rat him out and talk about your interest in herbal medicine or massage therapy, you're probably good.  They're going to ask you if you're a cop, just keep saying no.  Six or seven times seems to do the trick.

The fish tacos are outstanding and, appropriately enough, baked (not fried).  Carne asada is very tasty.  Generous portions, cheap eats, humble digs, super-friendly proprietor, improbable number of teen employees behind the counter.  Non-wimpy salsa.  BYOB if you want to eat on the patio.  Funky little shack, man."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to try Two Hippies ever since I moved to Central Phoenix. Finally, I made good on my promise.

Two Hippies is the BEST. The tacos are stellar and it's BYOB. Love it!

Plus, the decor is sick and the staff are friendly. I have nothing but positivity for the Two Hippies. The big smiley face outside is me every time I leave.

:)"}
{"text":"The food is AMAZING! I got the the shrimp taco and shredded green chili beef rice bowl and it was soooooooo good! Service was insanely fast even when the place was so packed!"}
{"text":"Always so nice, fast, and accommodating here! Also an amazing price on food for the portions you get"}
{"text":"This a chill taco spot with a great vibe and friendly service. Try the grilled fish tacos and I'd recommend them on corn tortillas.  The only lying reason I didn't give them 5 starts is because the target of has a bean and rice base that the fish sits on top of and then has a cream and salad with cheese over it, all of which seemed to over power the fish flavor and made me feel like I was eating a stuffed fish burrito.  It was still good though, but not what I was after when I ordered the tacos."}
{"text":"The Beachhouse is always my go to spot for lunch. Consistently delicious food, staff is always friendly, and I can't say enough great things about the overall experience"}
{"text":"Awesome, quick service with delicious tacos. The spicy mayo is a must and all the sauces are delectable. The shrimp, fried fish, and grilled fish tacos were to die for. Awesome staff and extremely kind owner. Homemade, comfortable, California coast feeling! No doubt will be coming back."}
{"text":"Store bought cheddar cheese on a fish taco?  What is this?  1990's Des Moine?  We've come too far as a dining public to have to put up with these conveniently concocted impostors.  Also, the \"Sonoran dog\" was less Sonora and more hippie haberdashery.

Both items, the fish taco and hot dog, were decent.  It was just their bastardization of these two original classics that got to me.  They were so far from the originals that they shouldn't have shared the same name. 

The place is alright, the prices reasonable, and the ambiance relaxed.  A nice place to include in the lunch mix, given you work in the area."}
{"text":"Pretty cool spot,I've always wanted to try it out.the shrimp burrito was good,I  thought  the tacos were much better.i would stop by again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Had a sixties acid flashback here, and I never took acid. That how authentic this place is. Good burritos. I had the grilled fish, my wife the chicken. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This might be my favorite place in all of Arizona to eat !!!
My favorite are the grilled fish tacos and shrimp tacos. They have an Americanized spin to them but they are sooooo good !
Every time I have guests in from out of town we bring them here. I also love the decor, it's such a happy place :)

Prices are great too !"}
{"text":"We stopped here for lunch on our way to the airport just bc it caught our attention. It looks like a beach shack on the outside and seemed out of place so we decided to check it out. So glad we did! Everything was delicious- fish and pork tacos, shrimp burrito and carne nachos. It was also super cheap and If we're ever in Phoenix again we will definitely have to go back."}
{"text":"It's like this place discovered me instead of the other way around. Maybe it's the hippie in me but whenever I eat here, my mouth is happy, my stomach is happy, and my attitude becomes much happier. Hip hippity yay!"}
{"text":"New Owner(s), New Cooks = New Flavor. Very Friendly but it just doesn't taste the same. It's almost the same flavor, kinda.  
I'm going to miss them."}
{"text":"Seeing the word \"hippies\" in the restaurant name had me stoked, as them tree-huggin hippie types got to have some vegetarian food, right? Yep.

I walked up to the lil window and asked about the veggie options, the guy behind the counter informed me that they have a cactus burrito and that it was one of his favorites. Score! Or so I thought...

Upon receiving the large, heavily stuffed burrito, I bit in with high hopes. Those hopes quickly dissipated as I found that the innards of the burrito were primarly COLD. The cactus pieces were cold, the cheese wasn't melted at all. The only thing that had a bit of warmth were the beans, which weren't even hot, they were luke warm.

Sorry guys, but a cold burrito isn't going to cut it. Make that cactus, beans and rice HOT in your burritos if you want some customers. Melt the friggin cheese in there, don't leave it ice cold."}
{"text":"Great taco and burrito restaurant.  The value for the quality of the food is exceptional.  Fish tacos and Shrimp tacos are the highlights of the menu.   Very friendly staff.  The only thing that could be better is the red salsa.  It has the consistency and appearance of ketchup and not much flavor.  The green is much much better."}
{"text":"This place had good yelp reviews so I was hopeful, but sorry the food is bad .   The passionfruit lemonade was good except a bit sweet, I added some water in it when I got home.   I got a fish taco, and a carne asada taco.  The fish taco was really fishy, and was like the bottom greyish parts of the fish near the tail sorta thing, and the carne asada I just didn't enjoy the seasoning.  I love cabbage in a taco, but not when it's real big and chunky i like it a fine mince.   If you want to eat a good burrito/taco go to the taco stand in front of charlie's (gay cowboy bar at 7th Ave and Camelback)."}
{"text":"This place always has such a long line during the lunch rush, I figured that must mean something.

It does. It means it takes a long time for them to take your order.

I don't get what all the long lines are about. I love the decor and the uniqueness of a beach fish taco stand in Phoenix, I really do. Especially since it's walking distance from my apartment.  But one fish and one chicken taco later, I didn't get it. They tasted like tacos I could have made at home with tilapia, store bought cheese, and store bought shredded lettuce and tortillas. I was very disappointed. I haven't been back since. I'd be willing to go back to try one of their fruit smoothies which people do rave about, but not for the food by any means."}
{"text":"I take my tacos straight up; corn tortilla, meat, onion/cilantro/lime.  Done!  If I'm feeling crazy...salsa.  So these tacos were like mini burritos as they had rice, beans, meat, and cheese in flour tortillas. 

In order of yumminess:

Fried Fish taco-  can't go wrong here and it was served traditionally with no surprises. (Fish, cabbage, creamy sauce with a chipotle kick)

Green Chili Shredded Beef- pretty tasty!  I would choose this over the asada.  It also makes me curious about their red chili shredded beef...

Carne Asada- it was ok.  Lacked some flavor, was a tad dry, and a lil chewy.

Let's be real, tacos are not the easiest things to eat.     Ergo, if it has all the contents of a burrito, tastes like a burrito, and is in a flour tortilla like a burrito....might as well save the \"taco head tilt\" and get a burrito.   That's what I will probably be coming back for."}
{"text":"The food was good and all prepared as I waited.  Looks like a long list of wide ranging bad foods that make you feel so good!"}
{"text":"Now we stand at a crossroads; perhaps a dilemma. Is it truly Mexican when it's not made by Mexicans? Is a taco a taco just because someone said it is? Or a burrito? The philosophies and debates of Mexican food can go on for hours. But I like to think of it like this: If it tastes good, who cares?

This is the case with Two Hippies Beach House. Opened by the same Two Hippies, Andy and Jan Goldstein, who brought us Two Hippies Magic Mushroom Burger, they use words like tacos and burritos but never actually say they serve Mexican food.

What they do serve is an accessible, mostly delicious, well-priced menu. Really, any three tacos are $5, anytime!

If you've ever been to some of the surf shacks in San Diego, you'll notice it's like they picked one up and dropped it on the corner of Camelback Road and 5th Street â\" sans the sand of course.

In true Two Hippies fashion, every square inch of this small establishment is absolutely covered with kitsch of all kinds; such blissful tackiness. The front is about the size of a postage stamp, barely enough room to stand after ordering at the counter. Once your order is ready, they call out your name. You can take your stash home or go around back and pull up a picnic table.

While you wait, take in all the decorations, though if you have some condition of OCD, you might have a problem with the clutter and want to start arranging and organizing. I had to put my hands under my seat so as not to give in to my secret urges.

The emphasis on the menu is tacos, as well as the hot dogs and lemonades. Two Hippies also can make any of the taco flavors into a burrito like the Red Beef ($5). The burritos are massive. If I had to guess, Iâd say they probably are close to a pound. They are loaded with tender red chile beef, rice and beans, and they fill you up big time.

The Cheese Crisp with Chicken ($4.50) is also huge and fully packed with tender chicken, onion, guacamole, tomato and cabbage. Itâs much lighter than the burrito but still very filling.

On another other visit I stuck with the tacos, ordering up the Taco 3 Pack ($5) and choosing fish, cactus and chicken. These tacos are massive, like all the food at Two Hippies. Youâll never leave hungry.

Interestingly, Two Hippies does not use corn tortillas, opting instead for the medium sized flour variety.

I'm always leery about ordering fish since we live hundreds of miles from the closest ocean, and on one visit my instincts were spot on. The fish was so strong I could only manage a few bites, even with the delicious red salsa it couldn't help that poor fish.

Although another visit revealed the fish to be spot on, flaky and mild, so the fish taco could be a crap shoot. The chicken taco was a chicken taco, good with a nice balance of veggies and meat. However my favorite was the cactus taco, tender sliced cactus topped with cabbage, onion, tomato, rice, beans and cilantro. The cactus had a delicate sweet flavor and with so many textures was a delight to chow.

Beach House also serves up several different topped all beef hot dogs. I had the pleasure of trying the No. 6 ($3.75), which is pretty much the kitchen sink model. A soft squishy bun covered with pinto beans, cheese, jalapeos, mustard, ketchup, mayo and guacamole. Whew, this is like the daddy of all hot dogs. I think this could have been even a plain dog and I would have loved it.
I'm not sure where they get their hot dogs, but the meat in this one was just so tasty, the toppings only added to my pleasure.

There are eight other hot dogs that also piqued my interest like the No. 4 ($4) that has feta, pesto-mayo, bacon, tomato and onion and the No. 8 ($3.75), which is covered simply in guacamole. I had forgotten how much I enjoy a good hot dog, look out Costco!

With 16 base flavors, the lemonades ($3) are a great way to to complete your meal. They use shaved ice so it's almost like having a slushy â\" complete with a brain freeze if you don't take your time. You can also combine different flavors to come up with your own custom lemonade flavor. The fun part is trying your different creations. Cherry and raspberry were nice and tart, but one combo was even better, the strawberry and peach. For me this almost had a creaminess from the round flavor of the peaches, this could be my signature drink on any upcoming visits if there weren't so many other choices.

Two Hippies Beach House does a pretty good job of bringing the walk-up taco shack to Central Phoenix, and it certainly entices all sorts of people. So if you decide to check this place out and you see a big bear stuffing his face with a yummy hot dog or one of the cactus tacos, please feel free to say hi."}
{"text":"Soooooo close to a perfect 5/5 stars for me.

The shrimp tacos..... Lord have mercy. Best shrimp tacos I have ever had. The chicken taco was also delicious.

BUT... check this... out of 3 of the tacos I had (shrimp, chicken & asada) the least impressive was the carne asada. Isn't that sorta ironic?! I guess this place isn't really for carne asada lovers..... BUT IT'S OKAY BECAUSE THE SHRIMP & CHICKEN TACOS..... totally enough for me to come back.

I literally bit into my shrimp & chicken tacos, groaned & closed my eyes. Those tacos alone are 5/5 stars.

Howeverrrrrrrrrr womp womp womp.... I asked for green salsa.... I got two very tiny little sauce packets :( come on man. I need like 2 per taco!!!! They're full sized tacos. Not the small taqueria tacos. Ugh. And the other let down.... the carne asada which I will pretend like it never happened.

Prices are actually really reasonable. I love it. Seating is only outdoor so just grab your food togo unless you don't mind sitting outside in the heat.

Final verdict: IN LOVE. I'll be back. I need to try the fish tacos, but the shrimp & chicken tacos are soooOoOoOoo good, I can't wait to come back :-)"}
{"text":"Wow, it is the day after the worst election in history. I do not want to cook dinner. Looking for a vegetarian place and we drive by here. My daughter asked to try it. So we circle around and OMG!! I'm so happy I did! 

The decor is so hippy and amazing! It's so much fun! I have found a new favorite hang out! 

The food, oh holy crap the food! I had the vegetarian tacos with the cactus. Hands down best tacos I've had in my life! I love Mexican food! 

The people are so friendly and fun!

Get down here!"}
{"text":"waiting on my oil change, i stopped by here mainly because the place looks pretty damn cool. it's like a little ramshackle shed, with lots of shaded seating areas in the back. 

you order at the counter and then pick up in the back. i ordered 3 fish tacos to go and they were ready in less than 10 minutes. and they were only 6 bucks! how cheap!

but they weren't the street taco size...pretty much standard size! and they were loaded with cheese, beans, cabbage, and fish. i was so impressed, i ate all three by myself!  
 
a definite plus and i'm sad they had to close their shop down scottsdale road closer to us. the grateful dead would probably eat here everyday!"}
{"text":"Came here a couple of times for lunch and have been able to try a few different things. First thing to note, parking is extremely difficult! Almost every time I've gone it's such a hassle finding a parking spot since their parking lot only holds around 8 spots. The first time I came here I got the chicken burrito and it was okay. Nothing that special but it was a decent burrito. However, the second time I came I got the shrimp burrito and wow that made me look at this place in a whole new way. The shrimp is grilled fresh to order and that paired with the chipotle mayo inside the burrito is amazing. The last time I went I asked for an extra side of chipotle mayo because it's that freakin good. The biggest downfall for me is their salsas. When I think of good Mexican food a necessity is a good quality salsa and unfortunately I have not found that here. Their red salsa is too watery and bland and their green salsa has absolutely no spice at all. I think a nice smoky, spicy salsa would go perfect on the shrimp burrito but since they don't have a good salsa, I stick to the chipotle mayo. Cool ambiance too. All outdoor seating which might not be as fun in the summer but when the weather is nice it's a great spot to grab lunch and chill outside."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of small, non-chain, family-owned Mexican places in buildings that look like they've been here since the 60s. This place was clean, the personnel were kind folks and when I sank my teeth into the red beef taco, I told my Dad it was the best taco I've eaten. TONS of meat, the sauce was yummy and very affordable all around. I ended up buying 6 more just to take home and freeze for later!

The patio out back is awesome, however I'd love to also sit out in the front and watch humanity go by. So we sat in the car instead. 

I'll totally be back!"}
{"text":"Food here is great everyday! I eat here at least once a week. It's never an easy choice between the Fish Tacos or Shrimp Burrito. That's why I usually order both this way I don't have to choose. The shrimp is marinated in garlic, basil, cilantro and lime juice. Seems like a perfect combination. Plus you can't beat the beach like feeling you get when your here."}
{"text":"Awesome tacos! Super authentic! This place is super fun, reminds me of a taco stand you'd see on a beach! They're burritos are pretty good too, pricing's not bad, good customer service. I like taking my friends here from our of town, they love it!"}
{"text":"Your guest experience means nothing to them . The lady with the short blond hair probably doesn't realize how harsh her approach is to customers and it makes an unwelcoming experience . I hope she tunes down for the sake of other visitors 2/2 bad visits I won't be returning ."}
{"text":"I love this place and will continue to go and get the fish tacos. 

I used to have a 5 star review but I'm changing due to the service I received today. I personally work 40 hours a week in customer service and during that time I'm not allowed to be on my phone due to I'm on the clock. Today as I waited in line I was FaceTiming my friend I haven't seen in weeks catching up with her. The cashier was clearly offended because when I went to tell my friend \"one moment I'm going to order my food\" he instantly went on his phone didn't greet me didn't say hello, I gave him a few seconds to look at whatever he needed but he was clearly offended, acting as though i was wasting his time..... that he was being pair for. I just blurted my order out which seemed to catch his attention. 

to easy up the tension I noticed he was wearing a sea foam green holster shirt, I asked him if he was wearing holster in which he responded \"yeah is that a problem?\" With the biggest attitude. 

Ive been to this location many times and have never received that kind of service. You can't be offended when a customer is on the phone, we all work 80% of our lives away and in that spare 20% if i want to catch up with a friend while waiting IN LINE , I'm obligated to, YOU'RE being paid to be there I'm not.  

Tacos are too good to stay away from tho"}
{"text":"Stopped by today and got the fish, green chile, and red chile beef tacos. The fish was the best of the three--grilled white fish with a creamy sauce on a flour tortilla with cabbage, tomato cheese, and beans. I prefer grilled to fried fish tacos so this worked for me. 

The green chile and red chile shredded beef tacos were good, but I wanted to taste more of the chile sauces in each. Nice tender beef without the lardy taste that you get at some other Mexican food joints.

The tacos tasted fresh and light, never heavy, and I didn't feel bloated or tired after I ate them like some Mexican food take-outs and restaurants. They were pretty big for $1.50; three filled me up.

They've got 12 different kinds of lemonade, but I didn't order any drinks. I wish I had after I saw someone else's watermelon lemonade. 

I's not Barrio Cafe, but if you're looking for a fresh, light Mexican lunch that is a local alternative to Chipotle, La Salsa, and Baja Fresh, Two Hippies is the place. I'm a fan."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review today without having read any previous reviews of this place. I did not seek it out, rather stopped in for lunch today because my girlfriend had been here many times and suggested it.

To start with, I don't throw 5 stars out there very often. Actually, I don't think anyone does. However, this place is such a little gem I believe that it deserves high marks for the service they offer.

My girlfriend and I each got a chicken taco and a carne asada taco. Let me just say that the portions alone, for 2 bucks a pop, are more than average. Add on top of that, the fact that they come stacked with rice and beans and loads of cheese and you've got a great bargain. I will say that I did not enjoy the chicken taco quite as much as I did the carne asada, which means I will probably just stick with the latter in the future. 

I had the privilege of meeting the owner as he stopped by our table to talk with us a bit about some of the changes he's made (more shade on the patio, misting system, etc.) and the newest addition to his restaurants, a breakfast joint, which he says will open sometime in mid July 09 and seat around 100. This is good news, I think, because there is not much seating here or at his burger joint. And although, they have no problem packing them in, even during these hard times, he was very grateful to be doing so well and hoped to see us again. He was very pleasant to talk to and also very accessible.

So let's talk about the service itself. You might think that a little dive place like this, selling $2 tacos (or 3 for $5) might just want to take your order and push you on through like cattle, trying to serve as many people as possible with very little personality or courtesy. That could not be further from reality here. The kid taking our order at the register apologized for blinking too much, saying that the grill was kicking out a little more smoke than usual. Another kid who brought our tacos outside to us was very polite, to the extent of saying thank you for coming and how they appreciate our business. Now c'mon, these are just kids. Usually you would expect quite the opposite but we felt very welcome.

The menu consisted of all sorts of tacos, burritos and even hot dogs. It seems they had an extensive assortment of lemonades, as well but we chose sodas. Parking is limited. The order comes out very quickly and for all of this, I love this place and will be returning.

It's great to have a restaurant like this that is locally owned, very easy on the wallet AND the food is delicious! I would encourage anyone to stop in and see for themselves. Maybe we'll see ya there!"}
{"text":"Very good food! Loved the fresh taste. There is something to be said about a burrito with simple ingredients that tastes BOMB! Boyfriend and I will both be back for sure"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! I work right down the road and come here AT LEAST once a week on my lunch break! The fried fish tacos are amazing! And john and his wife are always so welcoming every time I step foot in there! No matter how many times I eat here, the food will never get old. Definitely one of my fav spots"}
{"text":"Best tacos ever!! And cheap too $2. Better than any Mexican restaurant or taco shop I've been too. + the owner os super friendly and always makes sure you are satisfied, great customer service."}
{"text":"This place is so cool! Great to stop by when the weather is nice. I love the little bus out front and all of the signs, has a cool retro beach vibe going on. I got a burrito to go here today after realizing I work like right down the street from it! I got the cactus burrito which is their vegetarian option. At first I thought they forgot the cactus because I ate half my burrito and no cactus in sight, but it was all bunched up in the bottom half. I ended up taking some out because it was too much. I think next time I will omit the cactus. Also they forgot to ask me black or pinto beans and just gave me pinto. I didn't think to ask, next time I'll request black beans! 
The people working here are nice and my food was ready super fast. And at only $6 that was a pretty hearty meal that will keep me full for quite some time! Another pro of the burrito, it doesn't fall apart all over as you try to eat it. Makes car eating slightly less dangerous. I'd love to come back, maybe try a loaded quesadilla, and bring more people to check it out!"}
{"text":"Blech.  Had the fish tacos, they tasted of fish that had been bottom feeders that had been frozen, thawed, refrozen and then thawed again before cooking.  i.e. mushy and not the best.  They were cheap though...."}
{"text":"I was asked to go here for lunch about 4 years ago by a co-worker.  I was sorta skeptical from the get go as I can be a little picky when it comes to latino/mexican cuisine.  My initial reaction when I ordered a burrito was...pretty good.   The really awesome part was the decor and really super friendly staff.  They really seemed genuine to thank you for your business

The second time I went I ordered thier fish tacos (minus the onion).  OMG!  Wow.  Almost perfectly made tacos.  Nice Chunky pieces of fish, and the lime is the extra mwah for these!.  The sauce that's included is in perfect proportion, although I must say some days are better than others (too much vs too little)

Now that I'm a fan...Fish Taco Friday at my work place with Two Hippies is the way to go!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here last Friday night. I really, really wanted to like this place. I have read so many mixed reviews about the different Two Hippie locations so I went here trying to have an open mind. The \"beach house\" is really cute and has lots of fun decorations to look at inside.

We ordered the 3 taco pack with 1 fish, 1 carnita, and 1 carne asada. I also had a blood orange lemonade. The lemonade was my favorite thing. The carne asada and carnita were ok but nothing memorable. The fish taco however was horrible. It was all mushy and completely unflavored. I think I took 1 bite and couldn't finish it. 

The service is friendly but was very slow. Including us, there was a maximum of 4 people in the restaurant the whole time we were here. \"Two Hippies\" is a great concept and the restaurant has a fun vibe but the food is just not good."}
{"text":"Their fried fish taco is the baby jesus of fish tacos. It is hands down the best fish taco your little taste buds will ever encounter. First off start with the flour tortilla then add the battered covered fish that is then deep fried to perfection. Add cabbage, cheese, peco and drizzle the secret sauce. Then top off the gloriousness that is with some lime, add green and red salsa ( dont pick either or just believe in me and do both). Proceed to eat until you explode. Guaranteed best fish taco you shove in your mouth no bull. On top of that the staff is friendly and the food is relatively cheap. Kudos to you Two Hipps."}
{"text":"So I go out today to find the 2 Hippies magic mushroom and a client tells me there is another 2 Hippies, that just \"popped up over night\" WELL I had to try it. 

After driving by, I finally parked in the lot and took a survey of the building. 

1. Nice outdoor patio
2. Clean and New
3. Small
4. Looked packed

So I walk in and there was 3 patrons. 2 young guys and 1 US Senator. Yep that is right, a full fledged Senator. Don't ask who because I cannot remember. 

So the 3 people made the place looked packed. I told you it was small. 

I was greeted right away by the owner. He is a really nice guy who cares about the food he serves. We spoke about the recent call his wife received from DINERS DRIVE INS AND DIVES. She asked the caller to not pull her husbands leg, because he is a huge fan and it would be a thrill to be on the show. 

The DDD reviewers spotted 2 Hippies via YELP! She explained he has a 4 star rating and tons of reviews. He was unaware of Yelp but took it as a compliment. ( I bet he looks today) HI!

The food is a healthy Mexican food menu. I sampled the taco trio of fish, beef and chicken. All 3 where wonderful, you sure can taste freshness. The favorite was the fish. $5 with a Coke.

The other items are quesidillas, burritos, tacos, etc. 

I tried both the red and the green salsa. The red is boring and the green is good. Neither of them will make you burn your mouth. He is tweaking the salsa so be sure to rate it if it gets better. 

I will return when in the area FO SHO.

Well the return was on 10-7-08. 

I had the taco trio constisting of green beef taco, carne asada taco and red chile taco. They were all good but the green was the best of the 3. 
The salsa needs a makeover. I was hoping for a better flavor this time. The green is good but sweet, the red is bad. Maybe a little \"mexican\" in it wouldn't be bad. 

Do not go here expecting greasy, gut  buster, cheese covered everything MEXICAN food. Go here expecting a healthier, fresh tasting meal. The food is prepared by a fat white guy and cooked by a Mexican guy. (not that that matters, my mom-in-law makes killer mexican food and she is white)"}
{"text":"It was my 2nd time here and it was just as amazing as I remembered! Food is hot, fresh, local and so full of flavor!"}
{"text":"I have to agree with a number of other Yelpers who have commented that the food is rather lackluster at Two Hippies.

The restaurant itself is very cool...stepping inside to order and waiting on the side porch and or back porch for your food is for a moment like being transported to Venice Beach or Mission Beach in Cali.

But alas visions of California soon recede (and you snap back to the the fact that...damn...I am still in Phoenix) once you eat the food here. The portions for the taco's and burros are large but oh so bland.

I had to drench a vegetarian burro I ordered with green sauce to get any flavor and even then it was still a bland meal.

There are much better taco and burrito shops in downtown Phoenix  (La Condesa Taco Shop is best I have been at in Phoenix so far...have to do a review soon) so look around and don't get sucked into Two Hippies just for the scenery."}
{"text":"Honestly, I was a bit disappointed with this place.

I'd heard it was fantastic and when I arrived there was a long line of people waiting to get their order in...it must be good, right?

I tried 3 tacos: Red Beef, Cactus with Cheese, Bean with Cheese.  The Red Beef was probably the best one, but still not that great...it had some bite and the beef was tender, but it still could have been seasoned better.  The cactus wasn't very good - it really wasn't seasoned and so it didn't have any flavor...at least the cactus wasn't overcooked.  The bean and cheese was probably my least favorite since it really didn't taste like anything.  I even tried one of their \"Magic Brownies\" (this one with cream cheese) and that wasn't very good either - it tasted like it had been wrapped in plastic and absorbed all those chemically plastic flavors...maybe it was older brownie?

All the tacos arrived wrapped and they look kind of awkward and wet (because of the steam) and definitely messy when you try to eat them.

Just overall, not very good...I'm sure there are a ton of places in Phoenix that have better, more flavorful food."}
{"text":"Without a doubt .. The spot! I travel for work and saw this place on the way to an account and made the immediate decision to come back after my meeting!! So glad I did!! The shrimp and grilled tacos are out of this world! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Solid food paired with an unmistakably unique environment. Love the sauce and condiment options."}
{"text":"The food is great and the customer service is awesome. I had the grilled shrimp burrito on several occasions and I must say this is now one of my favorite spots to eat."}
{"text":"Only been here once but man was it delicious, definitely coming back. Must try the red beef burrito, tastes like birria/barbacoa with rice and cabbage, can't remember what else is in it but it was amazing! Pair it with a lemonade yum!"}
{"text":"My husband and I just had lunch here for the first time. DELICIOUS!!!! Wonderful service! Great prices and atmosphere!! We got the grilled fish, fried fish, carne asada, pork, chicken and green Chile beef tacos. Loved them all! Favorites were the grilled fish and green chile beef. We will definitely be back soon!!"}
{"text":"My daughter who just graduated from GCU suggested this place and said it was a \"cheap eats\".  I did and loved it. The fish tacos and steak tacos were so delicious. I only wish we could of visited a second time to try out some of the other items. Wish we had a place like this in Hawaii. I felt this place could fit in with our island scene plus the tacos were \"Ono\" (delicious)."}
{"text":"I had dinner Wednesday night at J&G Steakhouse and dinner Saturday at T-Cook's.  In between, I had dinner at Two Hippies.

I enjoyed a pork burrito stuffed with meat, cabbage, cheese, rice and beans.  The burrito was huge and tasted great.  It actually started to fall apart at the end because it was filled so full and that was all right with me.

Including a can of coke, the total cost was $6.  That was my cheapest dinner out last week by a mile!"}
{"text":"I cannot rave enough about this place. Everything is delicious. I come here often enough the cooks know me by name and know my usual; Spicy shrimp rice bowl, easy on the rice, black beans, extra cabbage + 1 spicy shrimp taco. Every bite is packed with flavor and with every bite I savor."}
{"text":"I've consistently gone to this joint for about the last year. You just can't go wrong with tacos made right in front of you. Quality ingredients and a brownie that is scrumptious. I suggest just ordering the marinated fish or shrimp special burro and calling it a day!"}
{"text":"I've been reading and hearing a lot of good things about Dos Hippies Beach house and let me tell you, it was amazing.  I got three tacos, chicken, pork & carne asada.  All of them wrapped in a warm panini grilled style flour tortilla (corn if you want) and stuffed with fresh meat and organic vegies.   Accompanying them was some salsa verde and regular red salsa, both were super flavorful and I assume home made.  3 tacos was too much for me but I devoured them all.  The pork aka carnitas was my favorite.  Next time I plan to try out their burritos or quesadillas.  This is place is excellent and affordable.  The scenery is cool, reminds me of a place I used to eat at in Ocean Beach when I lived in San Diego.  It's a must try!!!!!  Nice work Two Hippies...you've got something good going!"}
{"text":"Green chile beef burrito and passion fruit lemonade...all yummy and burrito is huge. I usually don't like ordering beef but it was tender and no no fatty parts. It all ended up in mah belly :)

Cute place with of course a hippie vibe random art and posters and outdoor seating"}
{"text":"Totally love this place!  This has to be the best tacos I've ever had in Phoenix.  You must try the fish tacos, they're bomb!  They also have other items on the menu too, which are all yummy.  The owner and employees are always nice.  So if you love tacos, quesadilla, and burritos, you must come here, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Fish tacos on corn tortillas here are even better when you take them home and nuke them in the microwave for 1 minute. At $2 each, they are entirely a deal and good for you, as they offer cabbage, rice, beans, cilantro, cheese (just a little), a baked white fish with a little yummy sauce.

I too thought the banana walnut bread was memorable, also at $2 per slice.

Woman-owned business is an additional plus!"}
{"text":"Grilled, not baked, to order =  Divine fish tacos doused with Chippolte sauce that kicks !

New owners, Kalen & John have totally improved the brownies too.  They are moist and chocolate endowed."}
{"text":"I am embarrassed to admit that this was my first visit to Two Hippies. Horrible, I know. 

I'm happy to say that my experience went exactly as expected. The food was pretty tasty and the atmosphere was...well, it was very \"Two Hippiesish\". I liked the place. 

The green chicken taco was flavorful and delicious. The guy taking my order was helpful...especially considering I was a Two Hippies virgin. Our food came out quickly and we were in and out within half an hour. 

I will definitely be back to try it out again soon."}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to meet up here with Christina P for lunch yesterday.  The menu is currently the same as the other beach house with soft tacos, burritos and hot dogs.  They are are planning to add tamales to the regular menu and we got to try a sample of pork tamale and it was tasty.

I got the three tacos for $5 and a lemonade for $3.  There are several flavors of lemonade but I got the plain.  I got one each of fish, carne asada and chicken.  They were all tasty and I tried some of both the green and red sauces on them.  One thing I noticed is the meat didn't stand out on any of them and there was very little taste difference between the three.  All the ingredients were fresh and there was nothing soggy.  I thought the lemonade was good.

They have only been open a week and of course the place is spotless.  The two employees we dealt with were very pleasant.  I always carry cash which is a good thing because that is all they take.  There is an ATM in the lobby.  I haven't been to their other location but I am told it is much smaller. Inside there were 5 2tops and some stools with a couple of tables outside too.  The tables would seat 3 or 4 (cramped) so I think they should have a couple of additional chairs.

Overall I see it as a good neighborhood place to grab a quick bite to eat but certainly not a destination"}
{"text":"Besides being a good taco/burrito/lemonade stand, THBH is imo the coolest club house on the block. It's chock-full of knickknacks, posters, and snarky signage that will keep you occupied while waiting for your order. I wasn't even bothered by the lingering smell of lavender incense, plenty of which to select from. I purchased opium and cherry. Nope, never gonna burn em; impulse buy. The side patio is a great spot to sit and munch on 2 dollar tacos while being windblown by industrial coolers and misting systems. I love it. Tonight's attraction, Poetry Slam, and man this was one slam jam. Note to self, take up ripping people to shreds by way of organized angry verbal release. Possible new found therapy. My mental first draft in play as a sit sipping on a paper parasol topped watermelon lemonade. In sum, I find one word that describes this jaunt, E-CLECTIC! Beats the heck out of drive-thru any day."}
{"text":"So I ordered a couple Spicy Surf and Turf burritos today and it was one of the best burritos I have ever had. Each ingredient was prepared and seasoned separately and when combine into the burrito was delicious. Plus this place reminds me of shop you could find in Ventura or San Diego. They also allow byob so that's cool. This is definitely a must try restaurant :D"}
{"text":"2 words: taco heaven!

don't expect authentic mexican anything, read the sign! hippy tacos = delicious tacos. great service--a cheap and enjoyable experience every time."}
{"text":"The fish tacos and shrimp tacos are freaking OUT OF THIS WORLD. So good, I was almost angry. The chips and quac are perfect, too. Adorable outside seating that's a maze of tables and patios. Awesome, chill spot."}
{"text":"I came in for a quick bite to eat after my sister told me they had good tacos and burritos and vegetarian-friendly. 

I thought I'd try a variety and order one fish, one cactus and one veggie/bean. 

First strike? I got attitude for a asking a few questions and asking that they leave the cheese and sour cream off. Then after ordering I realized they use flour tortilla (listed NO WHERE on the board) and asked that they use corn tortilla instead of their flour since I am gluten-free. 

Ok, whatever. I get it. I am complicated and so are my orders. This isn't new.

Second strike? They were slower than hell! 

Their fish tacos were delicious. Oh so messy and oh so yummy.
But the cactus tacos? It was just OK. And the black bean taco? Not so much. It was bland and dry. 

Maybe I just had high-expectations for a Taco joint in Phoenix?

I'd try them again just for their fish tacos if I was nearby, but I wouldn't go out of my way."}
{"text":"My new shrimp burrito place.  I just finished with a Saturday work out stint and had to balance it out with a Shrimp burrito.  I didn't want to drive far and had always been meaning to stop here out of curiosity.  I'm glad I did.  It has a retro beach feel to it and they were cooking up a storm.  I asked about the size of the burrito since I was pretty hungry and they said about a pound.  I got it and no kidding, it was like a min football.  I got the spicy one and it was full of flavor.  Staff is extra helpful, they will walk it out to you and hand it to you instead of bellowing out a number like your at a cattle call.  I'm hooked."}
{"text":"I have always driven past this place and finally stopped when my son was famished and I did not want to go to Culver's.  What a hidden gem! Greeted by the owner, the cook and counter person right when I walked in and the burger was excellent! Love to support a locally owned place who is doing food right! Try their Daily special- always creative and good. I am hooked!"}
{"text":"I had some time to burn and was getting hungry so I stopped here. Ive heard about this place for a bit but never have given it  a chance.  Between the old vdub out front and the sign for \"the best fish tacos in town\"  I was in.   And who doesn't love a good fish taco.  

I ordered the one they are supposedly famous for there fried fish taco and a grilled fish taco.  To be honest I wasn't impressed with the fish taco it was good but the grilled shrimp taco was AMAZING 

I would go back there again for the gilled shrimp taco I think they are the best I have had in the Phoenix area.  There prices were reasonable the tacos were about $3 each. And I got there just before the lunch rush at noon.  Service was quick and friendly.   I read somewhere that they had some health code violations and I did notice that the place needed to be cleaned a little more.  But for me good food at a good price with good service is worthy of five stars."}
{"text":"Just stopped in for a taco or two (or who am I kidding? when it's three tacos for $6 you buy three tacos) I got the grilled fish, the green chili beef and the pork. It's kind of a choose your own adventure when you order three tacos and since I start and finish on the same taco, I had to pick my favorite child. I started with the fish taco, you know the Olive Barragan of Tacos. It was very tasty. They put rice and cabbage and a Chipotle sauce on it. It was a solid taco. I then went to taco #2, the green chili beef. This guy was so very tasty. This was the taco that solidified my return to this place. Having tried their salsa out on the fish taco o decided that their green was the tastiest and put some on taco #2. Happy day. Finally my pork taco. It was a great end to the meal. I washed it down with a blended strawberry lemonade which was $3, a little pricey but they got me to fall for then with the three tacos for six bucks hiw could I say no. Tip these guys is my last bit of advice. They're sweating hard in the 110° AZ heat. The outside searing has some solid mist going and fans so you stay cool but those boys earn their tips. Oh yeah good atmosphere and lots of fun stuff to look at."}
{"text":"We took a trip on our lunch hour to grab some grub for work. I had the burrito special \"Chicken Piccata\". umm as long as I have lived, chicken piccata consists of: chicken breast cutlets, dredged in flour, browned, served with sauce of butter, lemon juice, capers, and stock or wine. Right? This was none of those things.. it was more like a chicken fajita burrito and bland at that. It was decent and hefty but Im sorry Baja Fresh blows this place out of the water."}
{"text":"I have been passing this place for many years and stopped in today as I was on a taco kick.  I had 3 taco's to go, which were delicious! I loved the choices of filling, and to go packaging.  I will return because of the quality, price and friendliness shown me.  Want to try the buffalo chicken burrito next!"}
{"text":"Awesome food! Their diablo burrito special is super delicious. Nothing fancy, just good ingredients and delicious burrito creations."}
{"text":"Took a bite of the tacos and it melted in my mouth. So delicious. And prices are not bad."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, great food, quick service. Perfect lunch spot. I always go with three fish tacos."}
{"text":"This place was awesome!! Very inexpensive. We had the carne asada tacos 3 for $6. Loaded nachos $6 ( pico, sour cream, guacamole and shredded cabbage). It was a good sized portion for the price. The lemonade slushees were also good. It starts off with a lemonade and ice base. Then you can add whichever fruit base you want (ie: strawberry or raspberry). I would totally go back."}
{"text":"My family owns the tux shop that's less than a block away from here, but that's not the only reason we come here so often. The food is excellent and the owner John knows our orders by heart. Don't let the size of the place fool you, these guys know their stuff. A beachside taco shack right here in the valley."}
{"text":"Bland, uninspired, mushy.

I had 2 fish and 1 bean taco. The beans were good - the rest of the tacos, not so much! They were kind of slopped together. No fountain drinks - cans and bottles only. So much for being eco-friendly hippies."}
{"text":"I've heard some buzz about Two Hippies Beach House, so when I happened upon it at lunch time I thought I would give it a try.

First of all, there weren't any hippies running the place.  Instead there was two lovely ladies, one at the front counter, and the other cooking the food.  They were both very nice and helpful.   

I ordered the 3 taco special, opting for a fish taco, a chicken taco and a carne asada taco.  I also ordered a diet coke, which was handed to me in a can.

My order number was called out and I recieved three large tinfoil packages...  I thought that was a good sign that they were so big.

However, I've never really been a huge fan of eating out of tinfoil or off of red trays, so that's where the experience began to turn south.

The tacos were filled with rice, beans, and the chosen meat, along with freshly grated cheese, and chopped cabbage.  They were quite big.  I wasn't sure if it was supposed to be that way, but all of the tacos were quite cold and flavorless.  The chicken appeared like it had come out of a can.  It was white and tasted boiled.  There was no flavoring at all. The carne asada appeared to be slow cooked beef, and tasted like  it had been boiled in water.  Again, no flavorings.  Then rice and beans were bland.  The pinto beans appeared like they had just come out of the can.

The fish taco had moist chunks of fish, and it was actually the best of the three, however the flavoring came from the sauce that was on it, not from the fish.

Overall, the restaurant came far short of the \"Outrageously good\" food that their sign out front touts.  There was nothing \"outrageous\" about it, and good, well the food was not.    

The best thing they had going for them was the two ladies who were working there who were very friendly.  

Two thumbs down for this restaurant."}
{"text":"If you like Cali in the summer time near a beach, come here. If you like tacos and burritos with a chill vibe, come here. The food here is definitely more than what it's worth. I ordered a fried fish burrito and a drink which came out to a little bit over $8. The menu is very cheap and the best part about this place is that it's BYOB (bring your own beer). Lastly, the fish is fresh and tasty as if it was freshly caught even though we're in, you know, AZ."}
{"text":"Finally stopped by the 2 hippies taco shack and brought a 3-pack back to work. Glad I did, with some remarks. Just a little walk-in shed for take-out and some minimal seating in and out. Beautiful day, so the wait was nice. 

I got a chicken, a green chile beef and a pork. All of the tacos have abundant fresh cabbage, whole pintos (!), rice and cheese. But also plenty of meat. The tortillas are fresh and chewy and just the right thickness. No Carolina's here, but pretty good.

The chicken, unfortunately, is grilled, chopped chicken breast. I'm not a fan of that, but if you are, you would likely dig it. I like tender flavorful dark meat. Be cool if dark was an option, but I doubt they're cooking whole chickens. Prolly just breasts. Ate about 2 bites.

The pork was very tender and flavorful. Lacked the crispy edges of a true carnitas-style. Maybe you get lucky sometimes and catch some edges. I ate the whole thing and enjoyed every bite.

The green chile beef had delicious, lean chunks of tender beef. Unlike any green chile I've had. More vinegary, like a Southern pork shoulder. Lacked any punch, although the girl said the green was spicier than the red...? Was pretty tasty, but I really didn't feel like I was eating Mexican food.

I didn't get a burro, but since the fillings were the same, I'm pretty sure it's just more of the same, in a different shape.

I would try the red chile next time, and skip the chicken. Wanted to try the fish, but it's not fried. I like my fish tacos like I like my hippie chicks: hot and crunchy.

The food is more of a 3, but 4 stars for being there, being cool, being fresh tasting. And 4 or 5 for the value - I think myself and another light eater could split the 3-pack, making lunch about $2.25! 

Ultimately, this is to Mexican Food what Pita Jungle is to Mediterranean/Middle Eastern. It's really not Mexican, but it is tasty. Like Cali beach food. I wish Yelp could do \"half stars\". Solid 3.5. But I round up because that's how I roll."}
{"text":"This is the definition of a perfect hole-in-the-wall spot! This place is so cool, from the structure to the decor to the staff, I can't really find anything negative about this place! The big smiley face and old school hippie van catches your eye when you first pull in, and you're further wowed by the awesome 70's inspired decoration with all the vintage and new license plates, and all the nostalgic posters like Bob Marley, The Doors, Cheech & Chong and much more, my kind of place! 

Service is super fast each time I've come here! I've ordered the vegetarian burrito (add cactus!) and the fried fish tacos. Both items were bursting with flavors and so reasonably priced! I can always go for Mexican food, ALWAYS, and it makes it that much better when it's a hole-in-the-wall spot because the taste is way more authentic. Me being a part time vegan and part time pescatarian (fish), this satisfies me in which ever mood I'm in! They have other staple Mexican foods of course if you're not feeling like a taco or burrito type of person.

Customer service is great, I've gotten my order taken AND delivered by one of the owners both times I've been here, John (?) is so friendly and welcoming, it's hard to find that often nowadays! I definitely see this being my frequent go to spot when I need my Mexican fix (which could be almost everyday!)"}
{"text":"Awesome scenery, chillest staff, amazing food. Definitely worth the trip. If you're doing an extended stay, BYOB  

Get the grilled fish tacos. You will not regret it...unless you don't like fish. Then get something else."}
{"text":"Hands down, BEST tacos in phoenix!! Service is excellent, unique atmosphere. This place is one of a kind. And you can't beat BYOB!"}
{"text":"Had various tacos and loved all of them. The decor outside was cool and the employees were very friendly.  We will be back next time we are in Arizona."}
{"text":"Was excited to try this place for a late lunch the other day.  Owner and staff were very welcoming.  Ordered a fish taco, carne asada burrito and fresh raspberry lemonade.  While waiting, roamed around the outside ... seating area could be laid out better.  Order took only a few minutes and my name was called for pick up.  Was suprised at the weight of the taco and burrito  ... felt substantial.  Tried the fish taco first.  It smelled and tasted fishy (not in a good way).  Very poorly seasoned fish cooked in dish water.  The (flour) taco was loaded with a tasteless mash of beans, lettuce, rice, none of which were very appealing.  Looking forward to the carne asada burrito, I was almost equally disappointed.  Almost no meat, and what there was of it tasted like old  pot roast that had been steamed into a tasteless mush.  Again, the burrito was filled with beans, rice and lettuce, but nothing was properly flavored.  The  tortilla itself tasted old and didn't hold together well, allowing most of the innards to fall out ... you know, when you've let them sit out on the counter for too long.  Ended up throwing away 1/2 of the taco and burrito ... something I rarely do.  The fresh lemonade tasted like koolaid with slush.  Definitely not worth the $3 price.  Food prices are cheap, portions large, but quality and taste are not lacking.  Two thumbs down!  If you want a cheap Mexican fix that tastes good, try La Salsita on Indian School and 32nd Street.  Great carne asada and slow cooked pork."}
{"text":"Great place for Indie fish tacos and burritos. This joint has fantastic food and great service.  It is nice to support \"non chain\" restaurants making a go of it. We had the green chilie pork and the red chilie beef burritos. The chips are home made and the salsa superb. The service was outstanding. We were very happy and will return soon."}
{"text":"I will keep this one short.

Value: Great. (lots of food for the moo la...wait is that how you spell it?)
Atmosphere: Ummm...interesting place.  But cheaply put together.
Quality: Ho hum. The food was fine...but nothing special.  Very plain.
Service: Well not much in the way of service...order and the window and get out of the way.

Not my favorite but worth the visit."}
{"text":"It's been about a year since I last dined here and things have changed and not necessarily for the better. 

My wife and I both remembered their burritos as quite enjoyable, with fresh tasty ingredients, sizable without being too much and properly assembled (which makes a big difference if you plan to not eat it with a fork and knife). Well this time, we were in for an awakening when we finally got our burritos (which took about 10 minutes for them to prepare on a not-so-busy afternoon). I ordered a simple bean and cheese burrito and my wife ordered the fish burrito. Both burritos were enormous, overstuffed and so poorly wrapped that after one bite, both our burritos fell apart revealing the inner contents to both be lukewarm with unmelted cheese and rather tasteless beans, rice, tons of cabbage and average at best tasting fish. In order to eat our meals, we had do scoop out at least half the contents in order to properly fold the bland tasting tortillas holding this mess together. Neither of us could fathom why Two Hippies hires cooks apparently residing in southern Arizona who don't seem to have a clue as to how a burrito is supposed to be wrapped so I suppose that is an achievement, The whole affair turned out to be a completely unsatisfying sloppy mess, and not one we are likely to repeat at any time soon.

It should be stated in fairness that the counterperson who took our order was enthusiastic and friendly. And the specialty lemonade drinks were good."}
{"text":"Just tried Two Hippies Pita Shack, having noticed those bright pink and green neon lights along Camelback road. It was excellent, had 3 Pork tacos, chicken burrito (no beans), 1 cheese crisp and 1 brownie for $13.50.00 how does this place stay in business? Well they sure know how to feed the hippie soul and drive away the munchies. Inside there was tons of posters of hippie idols like Jim Morrison, Cheech and Chong, Beetles, etc, and tons of chachkas. Their Pork tacos were done just right and that food was pure joy, 
The lady behind the counter looked like 2nd or now 3rd generation hippy with a tie-dye-dead-heads style look. The guy cooking was obviously not hippie. 
But the place was cute, the food was great, and the price very hippie-reasonable--you rock \"Two Hippies\"!"}
{"text":"My favorite thing about all of the Two Hippies restaurants is the lemonades. They are so fantastic. 

I love the beach house specifically because I love that I can sit outside on the eclectic deck and eat my tasty beach food. I love the chicken quesadillas here, I could probably eat about six of them in one sitting, just because they taste so darn good. 

The staff is awesome and funny. 

My advice, though: Do not come to this specific location on a school day around 3:00. All of the Xavier students are just getting out of school and SWAMP this place. It's already extremely crammed in the front of the building. Do not put yourself in a crammed building with 25 15-year old school girls... it is extremely hard to move."}
{"text":"ok, I still love the tacos and burritos from here, but now they don't take cash. still no iced tea and the patio area in the summer time is miserable.
it will probably be a while before a I go here again, unless I actually have some cash on me, which is rare."}
{"text":"I visited Two Hippies several months ago and was so unimpressed that I didn't even bother to Yelp about it until now during a \"new restaurant\" dry spell (Read: I'm broke.)  In my experience, tacos are one of the most foolproof foods around, mostly because I love them for their simplicity.  The tacos at Two Hippies were so bland that I didn't even bother to finish the second one.  My boyfriend said his carne asada burrito was decent, but I think steak just makes him happy.  I understand from recent reviews that Two Hippies is under new management.  But, I won't personally be going out of my way to try them again."}
{"text":"Great food, customer service and a fun experience! I recommend this unique food stand to anyone. I will be back as a regular."}
{"text":"Great place to get a tasty burrito. It's small and cozy, only missed a start because in the summer it can get really out outside and only place you can sit."}
{"text":"Great 'street' tacos.  After cruising around downtown, I decided to finally stop here for a quick dinner/snack.  Three tacos and a lemonade came to $7.50.  I ordered the Carne Asada, Pork and Fish tacos.  I could only eat two at that time.  I tried the pork and the fish.  Both very good!  The carne asada (several hours later) was also very good, and probably would have been great had it been fresh and warm.  No frills, limited seating.  The owner (??) Andy was super nice and chatty.  I've driven by at lunch, and seen the place packed.  Dinner last night was not the case.  Food still seemed fresh, though.  I will be back (wish they were open later, though)

Just had lunch here again today!  The fish tacos were actually better then I remember!  The pork was also very good, juicy and tender.  I was less impressed with the carne asada, though.  Still, a good experience, and still highly recommended.  They would get 5 stars if they had alcohol and were open later..."}
{"text":"I was disappointed in my last visit, I had the 3 tacos ( carne asada and red beef). The carne asada was really bad...tons of fat and grissle, I was only able to take 3 bites and I could not do no more. The red beef had good flavor, the problem was that the meat is cooked in a broth, so when they put it in the taco the whole tortilla was soaked and falling apart..I ended up having to pick at it with a fork.

My husband had a carne asada burrito..again the meat was not good and he did not like the cabbage ..it looked old and tasted old.

The service was solid and there are other things that I like about the place...but they need some quality control..who wants to eat fatty carne asada and soggy tacos??? 

Two hippies if you are out there reading this..please...address some of these issues, I really want to come back."}
{"text":"I have been here twice in the last week and loved it! The place is now called, The Burger Shack. On my first visit I had a hot dog covered in bacon, shredded cheese, guacamole, and mustard....it was perfect. 

Next visit I had their BBQ Bacon Burger...the burgers here are cooked on the grill, with real fire...amazing burger. 

They are serving a small selection of breakfast items all day, hot dogs, burgers, and some sandwiches. The owners here are nice and friendly and go out of their way to give great customer service...and the place was VERY clean on both visits."}
{"text":"This place is extremely sub par for a place that specializes in tacos. I'm pretty sure that they use canned chicken for their tacos & burritos and London broiled low-grade beef (which they try to pass of as carne asada). All in all, I could make their menu at home and have it taste better. The prices are cheap so I guess that you get what you pay for; however, I could get a much better tasting burrito at Chipotle or a local Filiberto's type of restaurant for the same price. I've given this place two chances to change my mind and my feelings have only solidified."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorite places to go get a taco at. I absolutely love the way they designed the place and is very happy you like and reminds me of my parents. My father also loves it there my mom would too if she was around. The best thing on the menu is their Fish tacos and you can get them grilled or crispy or however you like it.  I personally know the owners who are great people and they really employees. Would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"stopped by this funky looking place around 6pm on a weeknight and no wait. ive wanted to stop here many times before but have avoided the twistingly long lines i see when i pass this place around lunch time.

the people inside were very friendly and although quite a bit stuffy and small inside, i could dig it. they have a large enough outdoor area with misters and fans and a pick up window to get your food at.

my friend and i each got the 3 tacos and a fruit slushie. i chose pear, and she chose raspberry guava. both were delicious and refreshing. the sign outside said \"flavor of the day - strawberry margarita\", and i was a little excited that they had margaritas but alas - no liquor license, so no cool, crisp, refreshing corona to wash down my tacos with either.

the tacos are good size each, with plenty of delicious choices of meats/fillers to choose from. we both picked red beef, chicken, bean and cheese, and carne asada. the red beef was my favorite, with the carne asada a close second. skip the chicken, it tasted rather bland. the cabage was delicious and crisp and nice substitute for lettuce. each of our orders came with 3 salsas and 3 limes, absolutely essential for taco eating.

i really enjoy two hippie's burgers and love their tacos. can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"My daughter and I came here after driving past it many times. She loves the VW van out front. We shared fried fish tacos and a pork quesadilla. Both were very good. Price was very good too! I would try this place if you're in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"I have literally no idea what maryanne S.is trying to say because the owners are amazing (nice, friendly, and actually remember who you are) and the food is even better. BYOB and \"dogs ok\" has nothing to do with food, but on it's own, the food is absolutely delicious. Best fish tacos I have ever had. Their carne asada is a little bit different than what you would get at your typical run-down Mexican food restaurant- here it is so tender and packed with flavor (and I have never found a single piece of fat or mystery meat). I love this place!"}
{"text":"If your,looking for on the go fast food and variety, this is the place! Hipster little place, with speedy service! Theirs tacos, burritos, etc, etc, options!"}
{"text":"This place was fairly good, I have eaten there a few times and have learned the pork tacos are the best!!!! I have also had the fish not a big fan, loved the hot sauce was good. While the food is ok, with a great price this is not what I envisions a taco. But the idea of eating organic is great. This is not your regular taco joint."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place since it's so close to my 'hood.  C'est la vie.  As the other reviewer said, the service is slower than Methuselah and not really worth the wait because it's just not that good.  We ordered some cheese quesadillas...you'd think it'd be impossible to mess these up.  Nope...it's possible.  There was actually too much cheese on it...about an inch of cheese...I'm not kidding...it was really crazy.

The lemonade is decent, but if you're in the area, why not go to the Middle Eastern bakery next door and get really good fresh squeezed stuff with a hint of orange-flower water--it's excellent.

We went back twice more thinking that maybe this place would get better.  It didn't.  :("}
{"text":"My husband and I were surprised to see the restaurant open up in this location and only recently checked it out for the first time.  We were pleasantly suprised.  

Great prices, super friendly staff, cheesy (but fun) atmosphere.  This has become a favorite lunchtime food grab for my husband as he also works in the area.  I'm happy to have found this little neighborhood gem!

FAVORITE FOODS SO FAR:  

Fish taco
Hot dog with feta cheese, tomato and pesto mayo (yummy)

Husband loves the Fat-Ass Burger


OtTHER PEOPLE'S POSTED CONS:

Yes it's small -- big deal
Yes it's cash only -- Slightly inconveniencing but I can live with this (as a small business owner myself who is getting eaten alive by credit card transaction fees). And geesh... they've even supplied an ATM inside the restaurant for the first timers who don't know any better."}
{"text":"tacos were HUGE and filled with so much yumminess. Great for the price, but would like to try more things before finalizing my review. Made a quick stop and tried carne, chicken, and fish. All had great taste, fish was a little to moist for me. Worth trying and stopping!"}
{"text":"My family and I just finished a long day at the Phoenix Zoo and were hungry, we drove for a while to get to our favorite pho restaurant only to find out that they were closed due to observing Vietnamese New Year. After accepting that disappointment we decided to check out Two Hippies due to their excellent ratings and only being a little distance from us. We pulled to the parking spot right in front, noticed several folks on the outdoor patio and in the kitchen, as we exited our car the person inside flipped the \"open\" sign around to closed and shut the window abruptly, at 4:18 in the afternoon. I understand if they were closed, but they blatantly closed in our faces with out any courtesy of speaking to us and explaining why they were closing mid day. That experience totally turned me off to ever wanting to go back, what a shame."}
{"text":"The freshest most inexpensive, delicious meal around!!  2 of these dollar fifty soft tacos make a plentiful meal.

The chicken is my favorite- I could eat these little bundles 3 times a week!"}
{"text":"There used to be a time when I would have given Two Hippies five stars, but their prices have gone up and quality has gone down (only slightly) since then.

I am still enamored with their carne asada and cactus tacos, as well as with their ginormous tortas. For the minimal price and speedy service, it is a huge step up on the scale of \"Mexican Fast Food.\" (I'm writing this review with the thoughts that Two Hippies can be judged alongside Taco Bell, Berto's and Del Taco as a more-or-less Americanized fast-food taco joint.)

If you understand portion sizing, the portions are perfect. A torta could easily be split between two people (at least, two young women who aren't voraciously hungry. Men, you could probably get your own and finish it.) Two tacos with your choice of main filling plus cabbage, beans and rice is enough to fill you up pretty well. 

You can tell the ingredients are fresh and high quality. The cabbage is crunchy, the hot sauce has a nice kick, and the beans are seasoned perfectly.

If you're looking for a sweet treat to go with your tacos or torta, take a sip of the prickly pear lemonade that they offer, or buy one of their \"special brownies.\""}
{"text":"Hey come on its a beach taco shop. stick with the chicken, beef or pork tacos.
great price decent serving size. You can have it with the cabbage, beans and rice inside the taco or leave it out. Its a quick bite to eat. its not a biog date night here. i stop in every now and then mostly at lunch when i don't have a lot of time or $$ and i just need a quick bite to hold me over till supper."}
{"text":"We used yelp to find tacos while in the Phoenix area --- this was absolutely awesome! Went with a group of 6 & everything we ate was super yummy and fresh. We had shrimp tacos, bean burritos, chicken tacos, quesadillas and nachos -- everything was great. Would absolutely come back here again on a future trip!"}
{"text":"Down and dirty but wonderfully fun.  It's more of an event than culinary value so unless your thinking you want funky vibes all the time I'd say there's no value in building a following."}
{"text":"Firstly, the tacos are decently priced and are great portions. I LOVE crispy fish tacos, so I was excited to learn that this place is know for their fish tacos. Couldn't even eat all of them because I found them to be so loaded with cabbage, and other items that made the tacos not so great. Cool atmosphere, great service... But wouldn't recommend the fish tacos. Many other hole in the wall tacos places could get you better tacos for cheaper!"}
{"text":"In my last review I mentioned the taco plate was $5, it's actually $6 - either I got it wrong or they raised the price a dollar since January. I still recommend it as they are pretty loaded with fresh ingredients and really good tortillas. I usually get one carne, one chicken and one pork - but the chicken is my favourite as the chunks of meat are HUGE and cooked to perfection. It's sure to fill you up.

One note: avoid the frozen lemonade. I was expecting a generous sized fresh lemonade slushy with a lot of flavour (I ordered blueberry) but what I got was a 24oz paper cup with Minute Maid lemonade, too much ice and hardly any extra flavour. Definitely not worth $3.

Minus one star from my last review for the pricing. \"Outrageously\" yummy but also some things are outrageously priced. You'd think that accepting cash only and charging no tax would also keep the cost down."}
{"text":"Came here today with my girlfriend to have some lunch and to try something new and different and OMFG we love it, good tacos good burritos, and it tastes just like it smells!! it's freaking awesome! very fresh the fish didnt have a fishy taste at all, it was Pure Heaven definitely will be coming back again and definitely recommend the spot to anybody!! The atmosphere was awesome it felt laid-back and comfortable it is so awesome for a small little restaurant I would definitely go and try their burritos it tastes delicious!"}
{"text":"Tucked away in a little row of shops.... they park the hippie van near the street to serve as a sign.  Stop in for lunch or to grab a bite on the way home from work.  It's worth it.  The cost is low and the quality is good.  I like the hot dogs and hamburgers, but a friend swears by the buritto.  Last time I stopped in, I tried a taco, and wasn't disappointed.

I won't say this is the BEST burger, because it isn't, but when I apply my little formula of priorities which includes cost, convenience, quality, friendliness and service.... this place comes up a winner.  There are better burgers in town at 2 or 3 times the price, but when I eat here, in addition to having a decent meal at a good price in a friendly environment....I feel good for supporting a family owned business."}
{"text":"I'm sitting in my home up in Northern California wishing I had a two hippies fish taco right now. Can't wait to get back down to Arizona!"}
{"text":"They always remember us. They should, we eat there 3-4 times a week. Great value. Fast. Great tacos. Thank you! See you later today. 

p.s. if you saw the decline a few years ago in quality, I did too. I stopped going. Now new owners and better than ever!"}
{"text":"Two Hippies is amazing! I would highly recommend their shrimp tacos! Everything else I've had has never let me down! My kids love their frozen lemonades! John and the staff are amazing to boot!"}
{"text":"Ugh. AGAIN. (Why can't I leave NO STARS?)

* New owners=same horrid food. 
* CHEAP DOES NOT EQUAL GOOD.  
* BYOB /\"DOGS OK\" DOES NOT 
   EQUAL FLAVOR!

Just another joint that thinks burnt beef is carné asada. It is not. And making it huge doesn't make it good or better or flavorful. 

Burrito House, 4140 N 7th Ave, MUCH BETTER."}
{"text":"Two hippies has been a guilty pleasure of mine for a while now. The customer service is as high quality as the food. My favorite menu item are the Fish tacos ( 3 for only $6!!!) which contain beans, fresh cabbage and rice among other quality ingredients. Two hippies has a relaxing little dinning area and a community post board filled with information about, jobs, services and upcoming events. If you're looking for a wholesome, unique twist on mexican cusine, I highly recommend Two Hippies."}
{"text":"YUM! Went here with my sister and papa right before I caught a flight because my sister said these tacos were to die for. She absolutely loves the cactus taco. I stuck with chicken tacos and they were flavorful and light. I appreciate the use of cabbage instead of lettuce, it added a nice flavor. I tend to enjoy Mexican sauces and dripping from my taco (so much flavor!), but this was a pleasant change."}
{"text":"I tried Two Hippies Beach House for the first time today and it was amazing!!! Growing up in California I'm a bit of a snob when it comes to tacos, but I could literally place this place in Santa Cruz California. I had the carne asada, green chili, and grilled fish taco. They were very good! I especially loved the fish taco! So much so that we decided to order another three for later. My six year old had the bean burrito and ate the whole thing. 

The customer service was fantastic. They were friendly, even joked around with my son, and overall had a good vibe. It really made me feel at home and brought back the California vibes."}
{"text":"What a deal! Quick, not greasy, tastes fresh, huge portions, and guess what......CHEAP! The pork burrito is exceptional. Oh yeah, did I mention that it's cheap!"}
{"text":"The shrimp tacos and fish tacos are delicious! Since working in Orange County, CA I have become obsessed with shrimp and fish tacos. This may come as a surprise, but up until a few months ago I had never had a fish taco in my life... Never had any kind of taco besides beef or fish! Crazy, right?! Since coming to the OC I have been eating shrimp and shrimp tacos like it is going out of style, now I can see what all the fuss is about fish tacos, and I'm hooked! This is the first place I have found in AZ that has fish tacos (besides Del Taco, which obviously just can't compare) and they did not disappoint. The flavor was perfect, the price was right, and I drowned everything in a healthy dose of fresh squeezed lime. It was pure bliss!"}
{"text":"So much hype for such terrible results. Tacos were incredibly soggy, they had a lot of mismatched sauces that didn't compliment anything, and all of their meat is flavorless. Three tacos for 6 bucks is a deal, but I would rather go to Tacobell and get something crunchy and at least seasoned appropriately for the money. Not a lot of vegetarian options unless you like eating straight up cheese. Seriously, I would never go back."}
{"text":"This place has awesome tacos! I had the fried fish and shrimp and it was beautiful. I loved everything about (would've liked corn tortilla instead of flour) but still tasted great. Also would highly recommend their chips and salsa!"}
{"text":"Awesome tacos and lemonade slushies. And all very affordable. A unique place with real character and friendly folks. They also have some good hotdogs for those with kids who don't like tacos."}
{"text":"This is my first review here on Yelp and I'm so happy that it's about this place! My roommate and I just moved out here from San Francisco about 2 months ago. Within the first week we went exploring to find some good places to go and eat or hang out. While we drove by we saw the amazing decor of this place and instantly fell in love! The owner John and his wife have only owned it for about a month now and it seems like it's been years for them. They just flow so smoothly with the customers and really make you feel special. The food is out of this world! I try to try all the different things on the menu but my heart is set on the rice bowl with cactus In it... Cactus!!!!!  Not to mention they have Lavender lemonade that's to die for!! I truly love this place and my roommate and I eat here once a week! It's a good little treat for us.  If you don't go here at least once, then you're missing out."}
{"text":"it looked really interesting when i saw it, and the place we decided to go eat on a sunday was closed, so we went to try Beach house because it was right down the road. 

Upon getting there the place is really confusing, so after walking around it, we found the place to order, on the West side of the building.

I got their chipotle pork burro special. It was huge but the majority of it was veggies and rice, i felt jacked. there was a real chipotle chili inside the burro so that was really cool

the peach lemonade was delicious with lemon twists in it at as well. I'd come back but it isn't the best of mexican food i've had."}
{"text":"Amazing fish tacos and the guys inside are equally awesome. Not only does the location look and feel cool but it has great vibes too. 

Taco Tuesdays? Forget Joyride. This place is BYOB. Just found my new favorite taco place!"}
{"text":"This place is as great as everyone has already said!!! I almost drove right past it - and I am so happy that I didn't!! I love the look of the place!! My fiance and I each ordered a burrito and also got chips and salsa - all for $10.00! Great food and cheap prices - fan for life!!"}
{"text":"Best fish and chicken tacos I've ever had definitely worth going out of the way for. you must try this lotion they are indeed psychedelic. can't beat the prices and the atmosphere is out of sight"}
{"text":"Fridays are shrimp tacos days! The bomb. Every other day of the week is fish taco day. The fried ones. Really, really yummy. This location has relatively new owners who have changed many things. Most importantly, the food quality and recipes have evolved, the original awesome staff remains the same (Nacho has been working the grill for years)."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! Such reasonable prices and mouthwatering.  I'm obsessed with their red beef burrito. Always my go-to. I also tried their pomegranate lemonade slush....SO GOOOOOD."}
{"text":"In my opinion, this is not the place for Fish Tacos. My order lacked taste, and condiments. Atmosphere is down to earth but because they don't have indoor seating I probably would not visit this joint in the summer."}
{"text":"Not what you would expect. 
This place does have the best fish tacos in town in addition to many other great Baja inspired dishes. Be careful though... The food here is addicting. 
I'm personally switching the mouth watering fried fish to a healthier grilled option. It's not a disappointment. 
People are very friendly and the place gets a little overwhelmed during lunch and other heavy traffic times. Hard not to be patient around all the hippie decor. 
Surprisingly... Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Think Dinty Moore canned roast beef...just like my mom used to make it for movie night at Town & Country's AMC. She'd make it with a can of Ortega diced green chilis, diced onions but this version adds cabbage and tomatoes. And all for $4. Love it. Before you go off on it, remember how much you're paying for this burro! Four bucks. You haven't had it this good since you had medium pizzas for \"regular price, four bucks, four bucks, four bucks.\"

I ordered the beans and rice on the side (they're normally served inside the burro), so I got to taste the sticky Spanish rice seasoned with chili powder on its own. The whole beans were pretty good too. Great as a side dish; so _glad_ I ordered them on the side. You can even take one of the bottles of habanero sauce to the table to impress and double dare your friends!

I have to agree with others' comments on the \"homemade\" lemonade. Like the beef burro It also took me straight back to my childhood, remembering sugary (think corn syrupy) Freezees at Circle-K. Definitely not fresh (except for the wedge of lime which was dry) but oh so memorable.

Don't forget the success of tiny Lenny's burgers at 15th Ave. Hippies pops at lunch being so close to the Brophy and Xavier campus. Great value, and location location location. I hope it's in the running for a permanent spot on the \"square\" (7th St to Ave, Camelback to McDowell).

Yea! Can't wait to try their special shrooms at the other location."}
{"text":"Great stop for lunch or quick bite! Ordered 3 tacos--green chile shredded beef, chipotle chicken, and fried fish. Green Chile Shredded Beef was the winner. The price was great--6$ for 3 tacos and I left filling full. You could taste the different flavors in the tacos. The environment and decor is fun and really unique. Would definitely recommend,can't wait to eat here again. The only reason not 5 stars is because I'll have to bring my own hot sauce next time. I like my tacos really spicy,but the sauce was to way too mild for my tasting."}
{"text":"I finally had the chance to eat here the other day and it was rad. 

I got a black bean burrito and it was so big I had to eat some of the filling before I could even pick it up. That is my kind of burrito! 

All of the ingredients seemed to be pretty fresh and tasted excellent. When you need lunch on the go, this place is perfect."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Went here when my mom came to visit, we had the fish tacos and cactus tacos. They were amazing! Loved the atmosphere as well with all the cool things hanging on the walls  I would definitely recommend this place for a nice chill place to get dinner"}
{"text":"Amazing prices, and the tacos taste so delicious and fresh! You eat outdoors so in the summer time it's pretty hot, but the food comes out quickly. Great place to take visitors or someone on a tight budget."}
{"text":"Such an awesome and different food stop than everything we have in the valley. The second you pull up your transported to somewhere fun. There's trivia games on the table, bright colored seating on one side, and cool decor every where. My first visit there was a long out the door, but it went quickly. Seems to be a lot of regulars which told me right away it was going to be tasty. The smell of the food made my mouth water and by the time it was my turn I asked for some ideas and the owner told me what tacos were most popular. She made everything sound awesome so I ordered them all  let me just tell you I've been back 5 more times since then in a very short time and brought friends. Everything is perfect, service is wonderful, and with the misters around the outside seating it's perfect even in the heat of the day. My daughter loved the picture opportunities and the tacos as well. Next visit we'll try the burritos. The shrimp tacos right now are my favorite! Yummy!"}
{"text":"ate there for the first time, never likes something so much to actually write a review but it was awesome!"}
{"text":"I'm just visiting in Phoenix but had this place recommended to me by my cousin who lives here. I ordered the three tacos for $6 special and had two carne asada tacos and one fried fish taco. I wasn't a huge fan of the carne asada tacos, as they had beans and rice in them and I'm not used to that, but the fish taco more than made up for it. SO DELICIOUS! The carne asada tacos had good flavor, I was just unaccustomed to the way they were prepared. The green sauce is delicious as well.

The service was friendly and efficient, and they were very quick to prepare the food. It closed at 8 and we didn't end up actually finishing and leaving until about 10 min after they closed, but they were really chill about it. Overall, a great experience and great quality food!"}
{"text":"On our way to Chino Bandido, we passed Two Hippies Beach House (photo: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/W537pidoTVQmn9x1GPpxgA?select=-KIBVG11wjL2YuGn5nsNaA). Ever fans of Two Hippies Magic Mushroom Burger, we screeched to a halt and piled on into the restaurant. 

Why would a couple of California-born-and-raised kids like my boyfriend and I want something from a \"beach house\" in the middle of the Sonoran Desert? We had faith in Two Hippies. Plus it's Baja-style, in the middle of Sonora-style country. Let's do this! 

The main entrees are tacos and hot dogs, with \"burros\" also being a dining option. Tacos run $3 apiece, but you can get three for $6. Filling options are: red beef, green beef, carne asada, chicken, fish, cactus, pork, black bean, or pinto bean. 

Burros, which are actually pretty huge (we're talking original Green Burrito's Big Ed-sized), cost $6 and have the same filling options as tacos. Tacos and burros come with cabbage, onion, tomato, pinto beans, rice, and cheese. My boyfriend got a burro with green beef and could barely finish it. 

Hot dogs go for $3-5, they're all numbered and come with a bag of chips (though that's not mentioned on the menu). Just a regular hot dog on a bun is $3, but I felt the biggest bang for my buck was #4 -- pesto mayo, onion, tomato, feta cheese, and bacon for $4. Other hot dogs come with beef chili, jalapeno, guacamole, pinto beans, and the usual assortment of condiments. 

It was pretty good, especially at the price I paid for it. It's comparable to Pink's in Hollywood, actually (definitely better than the Knott's Berry Farm branch, I can tell you that right now). 

Our grub: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/W537pidoTVQmn9x1GPpxgA?select=3a-7JBtNWFZA9paBD0cBdA

Just like Magic Mushroom, this Two Hippies restaurant sells flavored lemonade for $3 (there's a very long list of flavors taped to the counter). I'd previously tried Prickly Pear (Beach House calls it \"Desert Pear\") and LOVED it, but wanted to try something else. The nice guy taking our order then mentioned some combinations he and the other guys working there made up. I don't remember the names and combos of the others, but I got the one he called \"Yummy in Your Tummy,\" which was a tropical blend of banana, kiwi, and other fruits, and it was GREAT. It came with an orange wedge inside and a little umbrella poked into the lid.   

My boyfriend got the cinnamon-flavored lemonade since it sounded so out there, and it was actually pretty good. I would have expected it might have gotten spicy to drink after a while, but he says it didn't. 

Outside of lemonade, they've got Chai tea ($3) and cans of soda ($1). If you're not digging hots dogs, tacos, and burritos, the only other thing they got is a quesadilla ($3/cheese, $5/chicken with guac and sour cream). 

There's only patio seating since the lobby in front of the counter is so tight (packed mostly with random objects in keeping with the ambiance). It was a nice breezy day and Queen's \"Fat Bottomed Girls\" came on the loud speaker. 

Yeah, we definitely had a nice meal."}
{"text":"Solid joint. Grabbed some green pork tacos for lunch and I was pretty happy with both the quality and portions. The preparation is simple and fresh, not overloaded with crap like some other taco joints. Ask for the green tomatillo salsa, its very good and went great with the green pork. My friends got burritos which were huge and a few other items which all followed suit in terms of quality and size. I will definitely head back for lunch.  

Cash only but they do have an ATM inside if you forget"}
{"text":"Two Hippies Beach House is exactly what it claims to be - A terrific taco and burrito restaurant with a beach-hippy atmosphere. NOTE - there is no air conditioned dining space.  All tables are outside and in Phoenix, that means it can get hot quick.  In fact, the day we were there, the outdoor temperature was close to 120. 

However  the food makes up for any heat discomfort.  The Two Hippies have a fresh menu with daily specials and what they make, they make well!  Highly recommend the spicy shrimp burrito although the fish tacos were wonderful (we did both fried and grilled).  On top of it all the staff was helpful, knowledgeable and friendly.

Peace in a burrito - Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Favorite neighborhood taco place! The spicy shrimp tacos are to die for and the prices are great. Staff members are super sweet and fast and the place is usually jamming with people."}
{"text":"Pretty good. I got a fish burrito and a coke for $5 in that cute little brown bag that I dig so much. It was enough food to save some for later. The waitress/staff person was *really* nice! It was my first fish taco, so I have nothing to compare it to, but the prices and location will make me come back. I look forward to having other food there and I'll let you know. I finally had to have one of the brownies (I usually eat at magic mushroom burger). It was interesting. It was soft, but the chocolate chips were sort of crunchy.  That may not sound too good, but it was a unique take on brownies and didn't make me like it any more or less. Of course, there were jokes about, \"Don't tell anyone where you got them\", and that was almost the sole reason I wanted one. My friend and I shared it and we had some left over."}
{"text":"WOW!!! This is a must if you love tacos!! You could get lost in the fun decor of quotes, bumper stickers, and a cactus garden!! The food is AMAZING!!!! I recently had a jerk chicken and pineapple salsa taco that changed my life! It was a daily special but anything on this menu is sure to please, and the variety of salsas ( which truly are not even needed due to the perfect flavor combinations), the staff is friendly and goes out of their way to please !! You must try this spot....your stomach and taste buds are sure to do a victory dance!!"}
{"text":"Yuck. The chicken in my tacos was dry and tasteless. The lemonade was pricey and tasted like Countrytime powder. The people that were eating here apparently thought they were awesome, and I was not, so they gave me the stinkeye the entire time I was there.

Came here on a friend's suggestion. Was definitely not impressed. Bad food, bad clientele...not coming back ever again."}
{"text":"This is the best place to get tacos! I got a vegetarian loaded quesadilla for only $5.70 and it came with 3 LOADED slices (very filling) I love going here with friends and family! I recommend the grilled cactus as it tastes like \"a juicy hydrated vegetable that's grilled\". I visit here often!"}
{"text":"It's always a good sign to see a line at a lunch spot. Tacos were pretty good, my least favorite of the ones I tried was the fish, not that is it wasnt good, just that there are others I prefer. Beans were just plain ole pinto beans. All in all a good stop with good food and the price is just right for lunch."}
{"text":"For a while now I saw these two hippie joints popping up all over. I decided to give one a try. We went for lunch. 

I ordered the 3 taco pack for $5 and a hot dog and fries for $4. I really enjoyed the hot dog and the tacos were... ok. The tacos are typical street style tacos on flour tortillas. Beware the lime slice that they throw in every taco, it was a awful surprise i wasn't expecting.. The beans that they threw in the taco were slightly under cooked so they were a little hard. 

The hot dog was on a toasted bun which was good, the all beef hot dog had great flavor and they pilled the cheese and bacon on the top of it (I ordered the bacon, cheese and tomato hot dog). 

I would go back but I will probably stay away from the tacos and just go with the hot dog. 

My search for great tacos continues... 

Hot dog, maybe not..."}
{"text":"Some of the best tacos in Phoenix!! Really cool vibe and everything is fresh, tasty and inexpensive! The crispy fish taco is amazing, so is the shrimp. Also, the slushes are delicious. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Yep. Delicious. Only been here once but it was fantastic and a good portion for the price. I got the grilled fish, chicken, and the carne asada tacos, and they were all bomb. The staff was nice and the atmosphere was laid back, just how I like it. Any taco you get is great. I go to Grand Canyon so this is a spot that many students go to. Will definitely be returning many times!"}
{"text":"The fish tacos are out of control, truly outrageous. The only thing lacking here is beer but you can bring your own if you choose."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch with my wife and the service was good.  My wife had a bean and cheese burrito and I had a carne asada burrito.  With 2 cans of soda lunch came to 12 bucks. They had samples of some banana nut bread that my wife said was the best she ever had.  We will definately be going back here again."}
{"text":"Gross. The carne asada tasted like dog food, and I think my fish was bad. 

I will never eat here again. 

(Sorry to the nice guy working behind the counter, I  in no way blame you :)"}
{"text":"Haven't had anything less than great from here.  I love the fish burrito and the surf and turf burrito.  It's BYO so take some friends and a 6 pack of beer."}
{"text":"I always drove past this place driving down camelback rd-- it has an amazing roadside appeal. The actual structure is very fun and feels like you are at the beach. They have these old school signs posted throughout the patios that make the vibe fun and relaxing. It's also a BYOB place so how can you beat that! The food was delicious too. We only tried the tacos but definitely enjoyed the spicy shrimp and fried fish taco the most! Cute little taco shop, would definitely stop in again!"}
{"text":"Great lunch spot.  Tacos are good and cheap.  Not your traditional mexican taco, more of refreshing americanized taco.  They are always fresh and refreshing.  My only complaint is often times they are too salty!  If they could figure out the salt, I might give it four stars.  Overall, a quick and easy lunch and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Went there for my first time today and had the carne asada burrito which was DELICIOUS! It was huge and my salsa choice, the volcano, was very flavorful! I would recommend this fun and quirky place to anyone who likes carne asada for sure! I will be back to try more asap!"}
{"text":"Wow, maybe this place is just playing on my Taco weakness... But at this point I want to rate this place a 7 out of 5 stars! Great Service, most of the workers are really big on being morning people, opens at 11 AM and a great way to start your day. 

Fried, Grilled, Cooked... any way that you would like your taco! I love this places taco's and they are very close to where I work! 

Very large taco's and Only $6 for 3 tacos!

Check out Two Hippies!!! I would like to try other menu items but I cant seem to find the discipline to go here and not order tacos.

If you do stop by, please swing by and say Hi to us over here at Chapman BMW on 12th St. and Camelback right next the Cadillac store! 

What a better day than getting a something that is new to you and a few of Arizona's best tacos!

See you around Soon!

-Phoenix Beemer Guy"}
{"text":"This place rocks! I love the spicy shrimp tacos and the surf and turf burrito. Just a cool little spot, also BYOB approved. Everything I have had from this place is very good. I have tried a bunch of taco shops in the area and keep coming back here. Very good food, great people who remember me and greet me by name, great price and good portion sizes."}
{"text":"We had fish tacos and they were real good, but not so good that we said, \"we must go back!\" We will continue our quest to find the best fish taco in the Phoenix area. Super cute building though."}
{"text":"Someone told me about this little gem a few years ago and I would always adore the VW van in front. 
The BEST BURRITO AND TACO I ever had!!! 
The staff is AwAesomE!!!! Shout out to Jack!!!!
I drove 20 miles back again to get another one, the same day! Cactus Burrito, Shrimp Taco, Surf & Turf, Sweet Chili Shrimp Burrito...yes, I had all of them the same day!!"}
{"text":"Really good California style burritos -- I got the surf  and turf which was quite good. The ambience is pretty laid back. Nice chill little outdoor area that would be similar to that of a beach side taco place in San Diego. The misters make it bearable during the summer. Their hot sauce and selection is pretty solid. I recommend this place as a good burrito spot."}
{"text":"I had the mellow mushroom burger and it was so flavorful! It also came with a ton of food.  The burger and fries were terrific, and if you get anything there, you MUST get it with the icy lemonade. You get one free refill of the icy lemonade and it is fantastic! Well worth the money and its atmosphere reflects the vibe of \"two hippies\" having a \"beach house.'"}
{"text":"Not too bad but not too great either. Good deal on steak tacos. Some of them came out to soggy tho."}
{"text":"I am actually writing a review for Two Hippies Magical Mushroom burgers...
Yelp says it is closed..... it has reopened... with the original owners... I ate there on Saturday for the first time.... the food was fantastic... the service wonderful... the owner took great care of us..... the burgers and tater tots were delicious... i will return... i hope Yelp figures out it has reopened because you don't want to miss eating there....$6 for a burger, tater tots and drink... they have yummy toppings to choose from.... everything is fresh and piping hot... and they take credit cards...
guess i will try this place next if it is as good as the burger place!"}
{"text":"Ok I swear I tried to like this place first it took 25 min to get my three tacos and nachos then my nachos where soggy. The carne was dry and not flavorful, I then tried the fish Taco it tasted like cat food. I didn't eat a forth of my meal I lost my appetite."}
{"text":"Food was great, service was great and we loved the decor and trivia on the tables. It was recommended to us by someone else and we are so happy they did! Can't wait to come back next time we are in AZ."}
{"text":"Solid fast food. An especially tasty option for grabbing lunch on the cheap. The quality of meals are incredibly high. They have items that you won't just find in any taqueria.

Two Hippies Beach House is a pleasant, funky little place. Gringo Mexicans rejoice!"}
{"text":"I am really impressed by this small place with great flavor. Cool vibe and genuinely friendly folks working.  I got 3 tacos chicken, red beef and fried fish to-go - it gets a bit toasty in Phoenix this time of year. Food was  flavorful, fresh and delicious. It was my first real 5 star to-go experience. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I had the burrito bowl. Didn't have much time to look at the rest of the menu, but noticed that they did have a vegetarian taco w/ nopales. The parking lot to this place in about 2-3 spots and right off the street. Not the most ideal, but it looked like there was plenty of neighborhood parking down the street. Eclectic bunch of seating and art -I believe it's an order at the counter kinda place. 

The burrito bowl was very, very delicious. I could have ate it again. I've had this place bookmarked for about 2 years, and so glad to have finally tried it! I'd be happy to return again!"}
{"text":"Best. Tacos. Ever.

Managed to stop by on an afternoon that wasn't too hot to sit outside. 

Had grilled fish, spicy shrimp and Chipotle chicken on corn tortillas  (which you have to ask for ).  Gobbled every bite. 

I'm coming every time I'm in this part of town from now on"}
{"text":"I went to the one in Mesa on Baseline. I loved the vibe, service, and decor. They have witty jokes on the walls and the whole place makes you feel like you are at a party on the beach. We ordered the carne asada burrito and the mushroom burger and the sweet potato fries. We got the dessert pear and blackberry lemonades. You get 1 free refill so we tried the blood orange and the guava flavors after. Everything tasted great. I would def go back and get the mushroom burger. The prices are super cheap and the portions are huge."}
{"text":"I love the shrimp tacos with green Chile. I discovered them while in the neighborhood and they are so addicting, along with the lemonade slushies. Carne asada Nachos are yummy and filling, I love the patio area, it def makes you feel like you're hanging out by the beach..very funky and eclectic."}
{"text":"This is a hip little joint and has the best fish tacos in town. I order them take out in the summertime...too hot for outdoors.  Great lemonaide too!"}
{"text":"Update: I'm having to demote my 5 star to four.. while I still love their food the last three times straight our orders have not been right! We order two crispy fish, we get one crispy fish and one grilled.. we ask for things to be removed on a quesadilla, and it's there anyhow.. we order two tacos, somehow we only get one ( though the receipt is appropriate to the error and reflects one taco. Still, in this case they repeated it to me and said two?) 

Previous: My boyfriend and I love coming here!! Sadly it's a Sunday and the lights are on but no one is home. Crispy fish tacos are to die for and the portions for the quesadillas and burritos are insane!! I'd come here every day if I didn't live in Surprise ."}
{"text":"I've been handing out a lot of poor reviews lately, and I hate to be so negative, but this one really deserves it. Sure, there are plusses and minuses, but some of the important aspects were all minuses.

I went in for dinner at about 6:30 and there wasn't a lot going on so I went in and ordered a red, green, and carne asada taco with a \"lemonade.\" The girl behind the counter was boasting about their fresh squeezed \"lemonade\" and I like when it isn't canned mix so I ordered it. I went outside and got a seat on the counter looking into the building and after about 10 minutes they brought out my food. I was actually kind of amazed it took that long to make 3 tacos, but whatever, that was fine. 

The first taco, the red, was ok. Perhaps it was the fact that it was overloaded with beans, cabbage, and other mixtures of everything that usually is on your plate at a mexican restaurant, but I thought it didn't really have a flavor. The green was much of the same, no real flavor, but not a bad experience. They were both just \"meh.\" Maybe now would be a good time to comment on that \"lemonade.\" IT TASTED LIKE A FUCKING SLURPEE FROM 7-11. You have got to be kidding me if you are going to tell me this is a fresh squeezed lemonade. For ***** sake you even told put slurpee ice in it. I'm not buying it whatsoever, that this has ANY real lemon content. Ok, so now that final taco, the carne asada. I had high hopes since the other two were so bland I thought maybe it'd be harder to mess up carne asada, but I was wrong. It had absolutely no flavor, and had a horrid texture I don't know if the meat was overcooked or what but it tasted like a taco with beans and cardboard. I had to douse it in lime and hot sauce to make it edible, and still bearly was so, partly because the hot sauce they provide is not so tasty either. 

I didn't look for a restroom, but I imagine they have one, as they would never be allowed to build the restaurant without at least one public restroom. The entire concept of the restaurant is very cool, and I can see it being a good lunch spot during the winter months, if, and this is a big if.... they can get their food to taste like something delicious. And actually make lemonade. Guys, who are you trying to kid?"}
{"text":"This place was really not that good. I was sad...I was hoping for something delicious and spicy and authentic - being that the decor was hip and the location convenient.

The price was good."}
{"text":"The burgers were good. The service was receptive and responsive. The atmosphere was appropriately laid-back. And although this was my first visit to this location (my fourth or fifth to all locations in the \"chain\") I think I can say that I \"get it\" now.

When people complain about typical chain restaurants they usually fault their faultlessness: i.e. Everything tastes the same from one location to another, no one item on the menu stands out (as good OR bad), the help is trained in standard service techniques which bar the display of any real personality, and so on. 

So I think it's interesting when the same people who avoid chains for their flawless, smooth symmetry will nag a place that diverges from that faultlessness while still providing what's generally a satisfying experience. 

Two Hippies isn't Applebee's or Denny's.  It's more or less what I would call \"amateurish\", if only it were possible to use that word without any negative overtones.  The spirit of the place is expressed in enthusiasm and rough-and-ready improvisation. Like this: \"Hey man, let's grill burgers and make fries and sell the combo for like $5 or $6. We don't need a drink fountain. C'mon--let's just do it. Look at that house over there. We could sell them out of there. Put a porch on it. Get some benches from Home Depot. Yeah.\"

So to me--having been raised listening to independent records and hearing a steady stream of entrepreneurial ideas from both of my parents--the spirit of Two Hippies seems charming and energizing. The occasional blips in service and lack of uniformity only adds to the attraction.

And you are free to disagree."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I LOVE this place. Best damn tacos in Phoenix and you can't beat the price or the atmosphere. My favorite is the fried fish taco, but you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I've been here numerous times, always for their hot dogs. Their hotdogs are great! Very unique combinations. I love the #4, 7 and 10.
If you have your work badge on when you order, you get a free drink.
Had I only ever had their hotdogs, this would be a 5 star review.

However the past two times I went, I had Mexican food. A week ago I ordered the chicken quesadilla and most recently I ordered the carne asada burro.
The chicken was well cooked, tender and moist, but it had obviously been boiled in water. Just water. Nothing else. No seasonings. And there was so much chicken (normally not a complaint) that I couldn't taste the cheese.
The last visit was just a mess all around. My friend ordered the chicken burro and a large side of guacamole. The order comes out as usual, in a paper bag. Within a few seconds, we found that during the 10 ft walk to bring it out to us, two of the salsa contairs had opened and spilled everywhere. So everything had a coating of salsa on it. What a mess. But again, nothing was seasoned!! Neither the chicken or carne asada had any flavor to it. The guacamole was just mashed up avocado. No salt or pepper even! 
Big disappointment!

Hotdogs - 5 stars
Mexican Food - 1 star"}
{"text":"This place has some bomb fish tacos! Not to mention everything is fresh and the staff is friendly and really cool. Nice lil dive place right on the corner.really has a Cali feel to it also."}
{"text":"This place is set near the heart of downtown Phoenix off of camelback and 5th ave. And his place is absolutely AMMMMAAAAZZZZIIIIINNNNGGG. I had ordered twelve tacos and a burrito. Everything flowed well together and nothing was overpowering the other. The limes that came on the side were the perfect pair.. and just one bite of the chicken taco made my taste buds soar. Will definitely come back here again for the tacos as well as sit in the heart in our beautiful city"}
{"text":"Had lunch will a fellow yelper here..  From the broken ATM to the dry, bland chicken, I'd have a hard time recommending this place.  I may give it a second chance because I want it to be good, but there are plenty of good mexican places nearby.."}
{"text":"This place is SO adorable. 

The grilled fish tacos werent my cup of tea but the GUAVA Lemonade and the Shrimp tacos were amazing! My new favorite taco spot!"}
{"text":"Driving by this place, it looks like a hoarder's paradise but if you slow down, you'll see it's so much better. They have all sorts of vintage signs and trinkets and fun every day stuff decorating their little corner of paradise.

Once you walk through the outdoor seating area to the interior to order, you're greeted warmly by an easy to understand menu and friendly faces to answer any questions you have. By the time you have a chance to sit down and get situated, your food is done.

Get ready because the meats are so good and the guac is fresh and the salsa is delicious. On this first visit I had loaded nachos, tacos and a burrito (shared them...I'm not a total fatty!). Everything was AMAZING! Add 2 drinks and some money in their \"Karma Jar\" (tips) and I still spent less than $20! 

I've been looking for a cool, priced, tasty taco shop and I found it. I drive past this place twice a week for sports and will be stopping at least one of those times for dinner. Check this place out!"}
{"text":"So I'm trying this place a few times now and I haven't been disappointed at all. I really wanted to try to read me in there green eat tacos but they were out so instead I ordered there crispy fish taco in the regular fish taco. They both are amazing but I would recommend the regular fish taco abundance the flavor it will blow you away. I also tryed the Polo it's not bad I just think it wax flavor compared to the other options. Their prices are very reasonable 3 tacos for 6 bucks that's a good deal. Their atmosphere is really laid-back and chill"}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time today with a coworker who loves it!! I had the shrimp tacos and they were very good.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"So this place, Is a local fav for us. This shack goes through its spurt of being good and average but to be honest through our venture with this business we have never had an awful experience with the staff or the food, AND the price is soo affordable. You should go! Taco TUES IS pry the best day to go, for some reason I feel like in the winter this business puts its best self forward if you know what I mean. 
-BYOB-Yes, actually."}
{"text":"Drove all the way from Goodyear (45 min) today for lunch on a friend's recommendation that this place had the best shrimp burrito he'd ever had and I have to say he wasn't lying! Ordered the spicy shrimp burrito and not only was it delicious but huge as well! Just the right amount of garlic and pepper mix to the spice made it a tastebud explosion! Highly recommend this place and can't wait to go back to try the fried fish tacos that are supposedly awesome!"}
{"text":"I tried all of their meats, nothing too impressive. Their fish taco was pretty gross, and the pork was bland. I do, however, enjoy their veggie offerings. Always fresh and good. Green salsa is my fav. 

I am also nervous of a place that is FILLED with flies, and this place is BUZZING with them.... Seriously gross."}
{"text":"I went here with a friend for some food to go and had a good experience. 
I got the pork torta and my friend got 3 tacos, one chicken, one fish, and one steak. My torta was okay, the pork seemed extremely salty though, i wouldn't order it again. My friend who got the tacos was more than pleased and stoked that they were baja style. He only ate 2 and i ate the steak one the next day which was still super delicious!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It's outdoor seating but it's covered which gives it a different vibe than most places you go to. The burritos are yummy and so are the tacos. I've never tried the fish but I've heard that's awesome too. Definitely recommend this place to any of my friends!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch but it ended up taking about a half an hour to get a hot dog & fries.  The dog was good, the fries just OK.  The place was small, but clean, the menu is just burgers, dogs, a couple Mexican dishes and a bunch of different iced teas.  The service was gruff, maybe even rude.   I might stop by and try again, if I have time to kill but probably wouldn't recommend them."}
{"text":"Honestly it's the first taco I've bought since moving out to Az and my first fish taco. So much better than I expected or It looks in the pics!!! Can't wait to try the shrimp! Woohoo and right around the corner makes it my second fav place out here. Been here for a yr n half, says a lot."}
{"text":"The food is great. I've had the Famous Fried Fish Taco and the Grilled Taco as well. I definitely recommend the fried version. Also tried the loaded Quesadilla with Red Chili Beef and that was really good. The wait time wasn't long and the folks are super nice. They have sit down places and fans  with midst ready for the heat."}
{"text":"Great fresh organic eatery. I had the sweet chili chicken burrito. Was very pleased with the price and quality. 
Great fun funky decor. Fun!! Fun!! fun!!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Had a delicious rice bowl with red chile and beef. The beef was spicy and juicy giving the rice a really intense flavor. The customer service was amazing. They will make sure you are taken care of.  This is a awesome little place to sit outside and chill."}
{"text":"I live locally, and have driven by this surf shack hundreds of times. I found myself really hungry after work, and, feeling bored of the usual haunts, decided to finally give Two Hippies a try. 

I got a heavy brown paper sack full of bulging fish tacos, and a side of chips and salsa. The fish tacos were juicy and very tasty - solidly good, yet nothing that blasted-me-out-of-the-water good. I think the value is what is most noticeable: $5 gets you three tacos with stuffings of your choice. I was very happy, and think that even Rubio's could go toe-to-toe (I may even prefer Rubio's fish tacos to Two Hippies). 

Check it out, and you'll get a tasty meal for dirt cheap. The success of Two Hippies is evident by their recent boon: I think they're opening two more places (pizza and a breakfast joint), to add to their local empire. I'm interested to check them out, and hope they are as good at the tacos at their surf shack on Camelback."}
{"text":"Ok. So I've never actually been to Two Hippies BHOTAB...but I'm going to review it anyway. JUST KIDDING! I've had take out but someone else has always picked it up for me. You know. I have people for that. First off I must say for bong sake you have the longest restaurant name evah! Secondly I must say your pork tacos really hit the spot. Granted one side of the tortilla becomes a bit slimy by the time it reaches me (from my people) and the foil is unwrapped (again, my people) and I finally plunge that delicious hippie taco into my boca. The pork is moist (ewww, i don't usually say moist...OMG...I said it twice) and a little crunchy in parts. Perfection. Seasoned with love. Like a good hippie. A few beans, cabbage, cheese and tomatoes thrown in and I'm happier than a hippie at a Patchouli sale. Or happier than a hippie in a muraled van selling incense and bongs on Venice Beach. Or happier than....oh...you get the idea. All this love for under $2 a taco. Now I know why you are Outgrageous! I may tye dye a t shirt, get out the Nag Champa and pop in Dazed and Confused. Now. Damnit. Where is that bag of Doritos?"}
{"text":"Loved this place!  We're new to Phoenix and happened upon this restaurant by accident.  We looked at the menu and decided to get the 3 tacos for $5.00 and a bottle of water for $6.00 total.  Menu prices include tax and they accept cash only.

I had 2 chicken tacos while my wife tried a fish taco.  Included on each taco is:  Beans, cheese, tomatoes, onions, shredded cabbage, rice, a choice of meat, which green sauce and red salsa on the side.  

These aren't tiny taco bell tacos.  These things are huge and delicious!  My wife loved her fish taco and the chicken tacos were also fantastic.  We can't wait to go back.  

My only wish was that I had black beans on my tacos instead of pinto beans, but my wife looked at their menu online later and found that I could have requested them.  A minor error I shall correct on our next visit."}
{"text":"Delicious eclectic place where you are easily swept away by the cheesy music (Copacabana a la Barry Manillo was playing when we arrived) and yummy food. 
Ordered the fish burrito which was good and only made better with the salsa provided by Two Hippies.  Make sure you bring cash... they are no longer taking credit cards at this place."}
{"text":"Hands down, best fish tacos I have ever had in my life. Was recently in town visiting family, and since  I live in Pittsburgh, I am not used to having GOOD tacos. The pork ones are also amazing, as well as the loaded nachos. The fried fish tacos really took the cake though - the chipotle mayo is out of this world! Next time I'm in Arizona, this will be my first stop!"}
{"text":"I used to LOVE this place but it has quickly gone downhill as it gained popularity.  Long waits and the quality of foods is sub-McDonalds-quality.  Barf."}
{"text":"This is the kind of fun and funky place that you just want to like.  Tiny, so going at unusual times (like later at night) is a bonus to get a seat.  They seem to be known for their fish tacos, but that's probably my least favorite thing on the menu.  The fish is peppered and not my taste.  However, the pork taco was terrific!  The kids had burritos with whole beans, great cabbage and tomatoes.  YUM.  And grape lemondade.  Sounds a little weird, but it was very refreshing and makes you feel like a kid again :-)  And with all the trippy decor, it's just part of the ride.  

Next time I'll try the hot dogs.  Seriously - the guy behind us got a hot dog with feta and bacon!!  Again, sounds a little wacky, but I can't find anything wrong with bacon and feta, so how wrong could they be on a hot dog?"}
{"text":"Loved the place. Great concept for Phoenix. A tiny place with outdoor seating. Good food and cheap. I had 3 tacos (fish, carnitas and steak) with a diet coke for $5.50. Can't say anything bad about that."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints!
The owners are super chill - Kalen & John, stop by and meet them. I love how friendly they are and they take the time to explain their menu options!
The food is very tasty and freshly made. 
The portions are very hearty...nom nom nom
I recommend trying the daily special since they always knock it out of the ball park!
I love the fact that they might extend their hours and talks about possible Sunday hours are in the air, now I'll enjoy their food more.
Ok enough writing, my tacos await!
Bon Appétit!"}
{"text":"I was out running a couple of errands last week and a friend called and suggested lunch at Two Outraged Hippies Taco's and Beach something:)

I hadn't been to a Two Hippies for a couple of years...I think it was their burger joint...that one didn't make much of an impression on me either way :-I

But I thought to myself...well, I like lunch:)

And, I like taco's:)

And I was a hippie of the first water back in my day (which, BTW, means that it's no longer \"My Day\", sadly:(

But I'm not thrilled by Two Hippies taco's:(

I got dos taco's...a chicken and a carne asada, along with a can of soda pop...the people taking my $5.00 cash were very nice (and they were trying to dress up like hippies or something, too!...too adorable for words:)

I didn't get fish taco's...experience (the kind gained through trial and many, many errors)...has taught me that the only place that I really like to get fish tacos, is from one of the beach palapa's in Bahia de Navidad...where the panga's pull right up on the sand...the fishermen jump out and hand the cook in the palapa a red snapper or dorado or something else with fins...they clean it, cut it up, grill it, throw some lettuce and homemade salsa on it and it's a taco about 30 minutes after it quit swimming:)

Those are pretty good fish taco's...esp. washed down with a cerveza or three:)...I don't remember the name of the place...probably \"taco de playa\" or something...just walk down the beach...you can't miss it:)

10 pesos each for the taco's, 25 pesos a pop for the cerveza...it's a very good deal:)...BTW, that doesn't include round-trip first class airfare or the Governors Suite at the Grand Bay:)

No beach at 5th and Camelback:(

But, I digress:)

I liked the service and the price (and I really appreciate the staff trying to look like hippies for me...really...a blast from past:)

I really didn't care for the food, itself...outrageous has a number of different connotations, depending on context...but I didn't find the taco's \"outrageous\" in any sense of the word:)

Although nowhere near as bad as Skip & Jan's attempt at taco's, the hippies taco's leave more than a bit to be desired...the carne asada was dry, stringy, bland, and the salsa they give you in the little plastic cups didn't really improve things.

So I tried the chicken taco and found it to be dry, stringy, bland, and the salsa they gave...!

Hey wait a minute...did they just give me two of the same thing and try to call them something different?!?!?...

That would be so like the hippies I knew back in the `60's and `70's:-)...always stoned, never quite sure what they were doing...so much fun to watch:)

But no, they gave me carne asada and chicken...the taco's just looked and tasted very much alike (the chicken was somewhat whiter, but other than that...not much difference:(

In Phoenix, a city with so many options for getting my taco fix, even the nostalgia for times long gone (and thankfully so...can you imagine a world in which all we want to do is sit around all day, get high, and make love...not war...where would we all be? :-) can't make up for these lackluster offerings:(

There are tons of better taco shop's...many of which don't even require the plane ride and hotel stay:)"}
{"text":"The Hippies thought they could fool me...the Hippies thought I wouldn't see their little trick with the profile change.

I haven't been stoned in a very long time...I pay attention!

So, since the hippies were good enough to change their Yelp profile to avoid these previous reviews, I think I'll post this one under the new profile.
________________________________________________________

A friend of mine called  and said \"let's have lunch!\"

He seemed so excited...and then he said \"hey, buddy...there's a brand new Two Hippies near Old Town!\"

I threw up in my mouth a little and said \"but I don't think these Two Hippies joints are very good\"

He promised this time the experience would be better!

He's a lying sack of...well, you get my drift.

I went anyway and had essentially the identical experience to my last (and I do hope this is my last) experience with the Two Hippies.

Not surprising that this place is identical...the very same franchisee operates it (in the location once occupied by the late,and not apparently lamented in the slightest, Desert Dogs and Dessert), that operates the other Two Hippies Joints that I've tried.

Two Hippies is recycling the very same thing over and over!

Oh well.

And except for the actual physical location and the fact that I had a pretty flavorless burrito instead of tacos, recycling the same review that I used before works stunningly well for this location, too!

And it's appropriate since Two Hippies seems intent on recycling their formula, ad nauseum.

Very \"green\" of them (except of course for the styro and plastic everything else).

Plus, I'm feeling lazy today (or green...I can't remember which).

Here is the review, for those of you still reading:

Husband had shrimp tacos, pork tacos, and carne asada tacos and said they were amazing. Super cool atmosphere, reminds me a lot of San Diego. Definitely recommend! Great last Mexican meal to have before we move away!"}

{"text":"One of my favorite places to go now, since i've moved to this uptown PHX area i tell everyone about this place it's amazing, the prices are good as well. they always have something new for you to try! customer service is awesome too, it's a cool little place with good vibes makes you feel like you're not even in phx. very different in a good way!"}
{"text":"This may be a gross generalization, but what kind of joint calls itself Two HIPPIES and serves their food on styrofoam?!"}
{"text":"This place is one of my favs to visit when I'm midtown Phx. I like pretty much everything, but usually get the tacos or nachos. They usually have slushies which are yummy, or you can grab a cold can of soda or water bottle from the fridge. I just love their meat, it's always so juicy and full of flavor. It can get a bit busy mid-day but what else would you expect from a popular joint mid-town? Try the fish tacos or carne asada nachos!"}
{"text":"Delicious!!! Shrimp or fish tacos are the best! The atmosphere is super open, definitely a great spot to take a group of friends."}
{"text":"Enjoyed my fish, shrimp, and spicy shrimp tacos from Two Hippies Beach House. The service was friendly and quite fast, it wasn't too busy there when I've arrived at 3 PM on a Saturday afternoon. While waiting for my tacos, I got to check out the cool random decorations/ layout of the place. I'd like to come back and try out other menu items. The food is 3/5 but everything else (service, unique decorations) overall would be 4/5."}

I recommend eating there."}
{"text":"What a wonderful place. I ordered a pork taco, a green beef taco and a fried fish taco. Everything was wonderful. The fish was crispy and tender in the outside, the pool and beef were beautifully seasoned and the volcano salsa was spicy but flavorful. Hands down some of the best tacos I have ever had!"}
{"text":"Great tacos and burritos! Loved the idea of cabbage in the food! Lots of flavor and quality food. Frozen lemonades went great with the spice of the food.  Volcano salsa was good for a weak guy like me.  Don't forget to try the brownies too!
Fun atmosphere and friendly and helpful staff!

Love local!"}
{"text":"Recession proof...

Mothers come feed your kids, I'm unsure of the nutritional value but as it comes from hippies it should looks healthy, this place has serious value, friendly employees and in my case owner.  I was steered towards the 3 pack and cheese crisp, which were both fantastic.  The cheese crisp is more like a quesadilla and enough to feed 2.  I'll be back many more times."}
{"text":"You and everyone else that I have given second chances to are very lucky, Two Hippies. Because there are no thirds in my book. As I like to say, two and you blew gots ter goo. So.

My first try of your wares was on a Friday night after Bikram's (I wanted to try this thing that fellow yogi, Donald S. calls \"retoxify\") and I was not impressed with what I ordered, but I did achieve retoxification. The fish tacos were \"fishy\" and their wasn't much flavor going for them or the rice. Now, class may have been harsh that night, but the second time around at Two Hippies was WAY better. I had the burrito this time, with black beans and the green beef. Ho' yeah! That hit the spot, and I was plenty full and happy, no sides needed. And mama got her suga fix with those delish Shirley Temples they have. It was so sweet I had to get a refill. Mmmph! Service was great both times, so no complaints about that!

I love the look and feel of Two Hippies. It is like TGIF on all sorts of hallucinogenic drugs. Last night, Rada and I were looking all about as we waited on our food. Somehow we started comparing the cacti in the planters to penis sizes of my *ahem* men. So if you are one of those men, and ever read this review, which I highly doubt you will, there has been a cactus categorized as the size of your member out there in those potters someplace...

But seriously, this place is so quirky! I look like I belong in here (picture to follow soon), I did grow up near the Haight-Ashbury, something probably rubbed off on me at some point, no? Have you ever seen how I dress when I'm not at an OYE? Distinctly Grunge-Bohemianish. And this is why I purposely don't let you see me outside of said events..."}
{"text":"Where's the beach? I love this place. The exterior is fun and exudes a real Santa Monica, Huntington Beach, hippy vibe. I love it. The interior is great too, having an eclectic blend of old posters and record albums. The downside is... there is no inside seating with the A/C. That aside, who cares, John and Nacho were great. Very friendly guys. Nacho had my burrito done within, it seemed like seconds. I sat on the East Side deck and devoured my little donkey, (yes burrito means little donkey). I had the Red Chili burrito with Volcano Salsa. I loved it! The burrito was filled with meat that is marinated to perfection, the beans and rice and other tasty offerings all rolled up and grilled. I love the taste of the grilled tortilla, enabling me to man-handle this one pound mexi-masterpiece. I will be back. They're menu is fairly simple making it easy to decide what to get. Next time... The green chili burrito. I can't wait."}
{"text":"The chicken tacos were DELICIOUS.. until I found a hair in my food... totally ruined everything because the food was so great"}
{"text":"Hands down, they have the BEST Shrimp tacos. Whether you get the Spicy Shrimp or Sweet Chili Shrimp, both are delicious! I've read other reviews that the tacos aren't \"authentic\" style tacos. In their defense, that's not what they're going for. These are beach tacos. Exactly the same as you could get in Hermosa Beach, Venice, Santa Monica, etc. This place should be on The Strand in Hermosa, that's how close they are to the beach taco stands I've frequented in So Cal. They also have great burritos. Everything is made fresh, from the beans to the salsa's. Ask for the volcano sauce, it's ridiculously hot, but very flavorful. The owners are so cool and personable, just all around nice people to talk to. The place usually is very busy, but the line goes quick. Awesome beach vibe and decor all around property. So if you want street tacos, this is NOT your place, but if you want fresh, delicious beach tacos, then look no further. I will be back indefinitely! So great to find a place like this, so far from the ocean!"}
{"text":"The Baja shrimp taco... holy Moses. Might be the best taco I've had in my life. The two owners run this place as well. They are super Duper nice and the food is amazing."}
{"text":"If you have a longish lunch hour, go.  I went around 5pm tonight and there was nobody in front of me.  Took me 5 minutes to get my fish burrito (Thanks to Chris T for the recommendation!)
It was HUGE and came with a little cup of two salsas: green and red.  I cut it in half to enjoy the salsas separately.  
Filled to the brim with rice, cheese, beans and the fish and smothered in some sort of sauce, it was delicious!  
Service was super-friendly and everyone had a smile on their face and said \"Amy, your fish burrito is ready!\"  I mean, the personalized service was great.  Maybe hitting them at a slow hour was what did it.  There is a little retail spot where you can get incense (they're hippies, get it???) and posters on the wall to peruse while waiting.  I took mine home, but the patio is lovely.  There's even a vintage bike parked out front with little baskets filled with potted plants.  How adorable is that????"}
{"text":"This location was my first experience with the Two Hippies restaurants, and it makes me want to try all of the other Two Hippies establishments.  I can walk there from work and I eat there all the time.  It's not fancy, but the food is really inexpensive and I find it very tasty.  The hot dogs ($3.50-$4) are particularly good - they come on large hoagie buns and are covered with generous amounts of toppings.  My favorite is the #9 hot dog with onions, peppers, tomatoes, cheese and guacamole.  Burgers ($6) are good too - juicy with flavorful toppings.  And, the staff are super friendly which makes a trip there all the more pleasant."}
{"text":"We stopped in on a Friday night. Ordered 2 chicken tacos and nachos to split. 
The chicken tacos are big and tasty, the only thing is the chicken doesn't seem to be seasoned at all. Plus it was a little dry.
The nachos were pretty good, again the chicken was flavorless and dry but the cheese made up for it, they were yummy."}
{"text":"Lunch at Two Hippies today.
This is a 4 star with comments.

1)  5 stars for small business, new ventures, private companies.
It isn't easy, been there and done it.

2) 4 Stars for location.  Perfect location, very fun.
No bathroom?  Not even a place to wash the salsa off your hands?
If it is there I didn't find it.

3) 4 stars for food:  Great Green chile beef burrito.
But it was a \"busy\" like I could get at a chain store.
Why do we have to have rice and beens in everything?
Carbs yuk.  

2)  1 star  for No Ice Tea.  No Ice Tea?

Will go back this week for sure."}
{"text":"This place looks like its not even a restaurant but after eating the food I was pleasantly surprised.  Their burgers are delicious and so was the different flavored lemonades!  The service was great and I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"This place is just as great as Two Hippies Magic Mushroom Burgers!!!  I got the Loaded Chicken Quesidilla.  It was fresh, taste great, and was very filling.  The atmosphere was also pretty cool.  Lets just say it was such a fun inviting place, I weathered the 50 degree temps to sit on the back patio!!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come here once in a while, and we always get the quesadillas... Absolutely delicious! And the place itself is super unique and funky. One of my favorite spots."}
{"text":"Was not impressed. I am not a fan of cold cheddar cheese, took it home to heat it. I am gonna stick to the other getho fab places in the area when I crave tacos. I do prefer corn tortillas to flour tortillas."}
{"text":"Mmm finally stopped and are here after passing by it on my way home every day. Had 3 shrimp tacos and they were delicious. They have 3 different kinds of salsas but I didn't like any. The place looks like a cute little hipster restaurant and love all the shade they have for you to eat outside. Five stars for good food and great service"}
{"text":"I decided to visit this awesome 'beach stand' eatery 2 days ago to taste their food and take more pictures.  I originally visited last fall just to take pictures(!)  I just adored their 1960s-70s decor vibe- I mean, music posters/pin-ups on the ceiling?  LOL.  I just got a kick out of checking every angle of this gem that stood out among reserved architecture/businesses on this stretch of a street.  Anyhoo, I sampled the vegetarian (yay) taco with Sprite (out of a can poured into plastic cup with ice).  $4 for a filling late lunch while continually to savor the remaining remnants that tided over the entire outdoor-only eatery: old license plates, vintage signs, painting of a guitar on a picnic table, 2 Adirondack chairs, numerous desert plants, vintage washer, and a '60s front-half of a van (interior was torn out, of course) that looked in sharp shape.  So enchanting!  There were others taking pictures like I was, and I just had to giggle!  So, food/drink was enjoyable and the place was clean & orderly with an approachable feel like at the beach.
I asked a sweet personable young gal working there whether the owner's from Los Angeles, because this place is also somewhat similar to the legendary Oki Dog hot dog stand of the '70s-'80s that was frequented by punk rockers & their followers (Darby Crash of the Germs, as a start).  And, she said that no, the boss was not from there.  Two Hippies must be an Oki Dog incarnate then.  BTW, the gal even asked me afterwards how my meal was (\"yum\") and was also happy to take a picture of me at the front with my camera.
Next time I have out-of-town guests, you can bet I will take 'em to Two Hippies.  See you there.  Smiley Face like their signage :)"}
{"text":"I had the Fish Tacos and they were good but not to die for. You had your choices of sauce to put on them which again was ok and the prices were really reasonable.. The bad was with the drink is only a small can of pop or small cup water vs I want enough liquid to wash it down. You sit outside so the tables could use a bit more cleaning, Overall I would go back in the near future."}
{"text":"My primal food instincts failed me today! Or was it their bright, colorful sign that mislead me?!  It said \"outrageous\" and the joint itself had distinctive designs from the 70s that stood out like a sore thumb in this hoody part of 16th St.  

I usually research a place before trying but this was a random stop by with a risk level of safe.  How could you go wrong with Tacos and Burritos, right? Well, it wasn't all that terrible but at the same time it lacked authenticity by miles. 

The interior decor was exactly what you would expect from a pot smoking hippie with posters of Jimi Hendrix, Rolling Stones, and Bob Marley plastered literally every inch of the neon green interior walls and ceiling.  I very much appreciated all the colorful details that was incorporated to express the character of the establishment.  The design department deserved 5-stars for sure!

Coming here, I was a bit hungry so I opted for their 3-pack tacos. Of the six toppings or so, I went with their Green Beef, Carne Asada, and Fish. The key attribute about their Tacos is their enormous size. As I was picking my order up, I seriously thought I was carrying back THREE burritos! I was overwhelmed with each taco as they were HEAVILY packed with chilled, diced cabbage and tomatoes. It was a one-to-three ratio of meat to vegetables, which explains the size and weight, right? They packed a fork and knife but I ate it true street style via hand. My eating experience was just a complete mess, literally. 

The abnormally massive size could not compensate for the quality. The shredded Green Beef was a little dry with simple Mexican flavors. I was hoping the Carne Asada would save the day, but still fell short. The tortilla was nothing special. It had a generic store taste to it than of an authentic hand made. I cannot review the Fish right now, as I took it back with me on the road. I was too full from the bland, uncreative flavors that one would have expected otherwise."}
{"text":"We stopped here after picking up a couple of pizzas at magnates on our way home to tucson from the airport.  It was exactly what we wanted! The food was DELICIOUS and it was fast and the staff was very welcoming and helpful.  We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Well....I spend a lot of money on restaurants and eat at the best and the best dives. This one is close to the top of my list. It would get 5 stars if they had indoor eating, I froze my butt off but  the food really warmed me up couple that with the price and you've got a real winner here. Communal tables make for interesting conversations. Fish Taco's were a disappointment, maybe because they are not fried...tasted too \"fishy\", not like Rubio's. Parking sucks but park down the street and walk, it's well worth it."}
{"text":"By far the best lunch spot in Phoenix. Hands down. The best tacos and burritos I've ever had in my life, and they're great every time. Super friendly staff and great prices. Every time I can find an excuse to drop by, I make sure to. 

Go, get whatever sounds good (because it is), and grab some of their green sauce to throw on top. You won't regret it"}
{"text":"Black bean taco.  $2.  Better than any/every burrito I've had in Manhattan since I moved, but not as good as some of the other hotspots here in the Phoenix metro area.

We went before First Fridays, and the patio was super cute all lit up at the nighttime.  Our server had a delightful conversation with us about Shark Week, which, you know.  Good good stuff."}
{"text":"Truly amazing tacos loved the fish tacos and atmosphere. Very friendly will be back again"}
{"text":"We were driving by and saw this place--just had to stop. My boyfriend and I asked inside for recommendations, and we settled on splitting the loaded nachos, the carne asada burrito, and a grilled fish taco. OMG.

The food was amazing, huge, and a great price. The patio was great and there was even a roadrunner on the roof of the building across the street to add to the magic of the place. 

This is going to be one of my new favorite spots, I can tell. Highly, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Loved the spicy shrimp tacos, shrimp was really very fresh and tasty. Fish taco could have been better. Place is small with limited parking but you have enough small chairs to sit. Service is really quick, my order came with in 5 mins. Price is also reasonable."}
