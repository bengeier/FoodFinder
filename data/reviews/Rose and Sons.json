{"text":"The space is very small but it's nice for groups of 2-4 (we had 3 in our group). The team is friendly and helpful when answering questions about the menu. I don't have a favourite dish but I liked parts of the ones we ordered.   1) BBQ shrimp nachos: guacamole, tamatillo, chilli jazz  - The nachos were really crispy and overall I liked this as an appetizer.  2) Patty melt burger: grilled cheese, fried onions + French fries, chili mayo  - I love thin/shoestring fries because it reminds me of McDonald's fries :) The patty was juicy and thick.  - I liked the grilled cheese, especially the bread. The chilli mayo had a hint of pear which was pretty interesting.  3) Fried chicken: sour pickle brine, warm mushrooms and potato salad, soft egg  - The fried chicken skin was similar to Kentucky Fried Chicken and the meat was very tender and juicy.  - The vegetables were ok...I'm just glad there were some greens. If you don't like mustard, you may want to avoid the veggies (notice all the mustard seeds)"}
{"text":"I genuinely don't understand the negative reviews here.   I tried Rose & Sons a few weeks ago and it was great. I stopped by for brunch with a few friends and left completely full and satisfied. I had the duck confit + grits for $16 or $18 (can't quite recall) and a cappuccino. The cappuccino was delicious and way better than expected. The duck was crispy on the outside and tender and juicy on the inside. The grits were AWESOME. Yes, I was initially weary of the small serving, but after a few bites I realized this was a heavy, heavy meal.   The atmosphere is super casual. I can totally understand why some people wouldn't like it as it's loud and a bit cramped. Having said that, the service was friendly and approachable and not the least bit surly. Food is great and came in a timely manner...even though the place was packed at 11:30am on a Saturday.   Oh, and good beer on tap...Kensington Brewing Company and Steamwhistle."}
{"text":"I had the hot smoked salmon-schmaltz hash with egg for lunch. Tasty and home-y, and good sized portions. Contrary to my own belief, I would've actually preferred the dish it without the egg.  Regardless, Rose & Sons was good."}
{"text":"I get the cheesy diner vibe, and most of the time, I'm all for it. But I'm appalled that the owners of a restaurant as wonderful as Fat Pasha could also own this turd of an eatery. Astounding. Guys: It's not cute, it's abysmal. If fried chicken is your calling card, try to ensure it doesn't come out looking like lumps of coal. Lance this boil from an otherwise inspired body of culinary work. Or at least, change the oil in your deep fryer."}
{"text":"Well.....the first thing I noticed when I walked in this morning for breakfast was the music.... It was as loud as it likely was last night for the dinner crowd. Not too nice at 9 am. The coffee was grand, americano...lovely! But when my breakfast, the lox-on-a-bagel arrived, it was me who wanted to YELP: what the heck was with the tiny portion?!?!? Even if it WAS on special, why wasn't there something accompanying it, at the very least some fruit? I will not return for that exact reason, very little value for the money.  I am sorry to say: I miss PEOPLES. Now THEY knew breakfast value."}
{"text":"Food: great. My spouse and I tried a bunch of things (duck confit with grits, bread pudding with wild blueberries, ancho chili w/ chili-fried eggs, fries and gravy); all were great. Service was quick once we were seated (had to wait about 10 minutes as the place is small and generally busy).  Cons: on the expensive side. Our bill (including an americano) came to $50 plus tip. Also, they're still a little disorganized (feels like too many staff running around), but definitely an improvement over what previous reviews had to say.  Overall, worth checking out. A nice addition to the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Went for brunch this afternoon because I was craving fried chicken. We were seated quickly and given our drink orders quickly and the servers were attentive. This is not the kind of place you should go if you're in a hurry. The line cook was working carefully and quickly, but the food definitely takes some time when they're busy. We waited about 20 minutes+ for our food. It was weird though how many staff I saw. In the cooking/bar area there were at least 6 people at a time, and then I counted another 4 who came from the prep kitchen in the back. For a place this small, it was odd to have that many people and have food coming out that slowly. The \"retro\" 7-15 year-old (and exclusively mainstream) hip-hop blaring in the background was annoying, like the place was trying too hard to earn some kind of hipster cred.   I got the fried chicken accompanied by the grits, poached egg and green sauce. The chicken itself was pretty tasty and I enjoyed that it was de-boned, and the poached egg was perfectly cooked, but the grits kinda ruined it for me. I love grits but these were just a saucy, creamy, oily, mess that were heavy and had the occasional less done, texture-adding grit. There was oil (probably herbed by the green colour) oil all around the outside of the grits which made it more closely resemble a cream sauce that had broken, and frankly, it is already a heavy dish and the last thing it needed was more oil.  I also had the peanut butter and blueberry shake on the server's recommendation and it was delicious. It was small by shake standards, but when you're eating a heavy meal it was a perfect, and I was pleasantly surprised that what I thought was a rosette of whipped cream on top was actually soft serve. delish!  My boyfriend had the PLB, which is one of Toronto Life's top 25 sandwiches and he was underwhelmed. I had a bit of it, too, and it was fine,but nothing to write home about,with the exception of the cherry jam. It was soooo good and cut the richness of the other components (fried egg, sausage, bacon, pickle, caramenlized onions) wonderfully.   Considering that we spent a total of $47 on 3 items and they weren't spectacular, and the atmosphere was almost abrasively hipster, I won't be going back any time soon."}
{"text":"As soon as you walk into Big Crow, you feel as though you've left the city life behind and have entered a hunting lodge. If there was ever a time for your true Canadian spirit to come out, it'd be here as you're surrounded by wood, fur skins, blankets, and water pitchers from HBC. The roof is covered and the walls have insulation when it is colder weather outside, which gives the place a much cozier atmosphere. A strong and delicious barbecue smell hits your nose as soon as you enter - get ready to roll up your sleeves fellow yelpers!  Between the three of us, we ordered the following (and it was more than enough food): 1) Steel head trout poke (with peanuts, chili, ginger, soy, furikake, chips) - This is the tastiest trout dish I've ever had. The dish is refreshing and is a good break in between all the meatier barbecued dishes. Highly recommend. 2) Jerk chicken wings (comes with pineapple) - Definitely has a kick and not recommended for those with lower spice tolerances. These are your average chicken wings - nothing too special. 3) Baby backs (with burst tomato pesto) - We ordered a full rack. These ribs were not exactly fall off the bone. Could have been a little meatier and more tender, but still great comfort food. 4) Rabbit (with honey butter hot sauce) - We ordered a 1/2 rabbit, but wish we had ordered a full one and only a 1/2 rack of ribs. This was the favourite of the evening. The rabbit is so tender and the sauce is delicious! Highly recommend. 5) Root beer & bourbon - As we are all bourbon lovers, we had to order a pitcher of this. Surprisingly, root beer does go well with bourbon - we'll be trying to make this at home ourselves!  Unfortunately, the corn salad is currently not on the menu since corn is out of season.  We ended our meal with a s'mores ice cream sandwich, which comes in a really fluffy bun with graham cracker crumbs and roasted marshmallows on top. This is easily the best ice cream sandwich I've had in my life. The waiter told us this was the last day they were offering this dessert, so I guess we'll have to wait for the summer to have it again!"}
{"text":"Small portions. Tasty food. Well executed and well made.   4 stars for food.   3 for service.   3 for value.   Really small so be prepared to wait for a table.  We went when they opened so did not have to wait when we left the place was full. I don't get the seating. The bench seating means couples take up tables for 4.  Half the seats are empty even when all tables are taken. We didn't have to wait for a table but I can imagine what would happen if we arrived at a typical brunch time of 11. Like I said when we left it was already full.   If I had to wait for a table and only got this food I would not be thrilled. This place is a solid 3.5 but I wouldn't go there during normal hours."}
{"text":"Great, cozy, down-to-earth addition to the neighbourhood.   My co-workers raved about it, so I decided to grab take-out the other day. The menu is small, and given I'm trying to avoid gluten/dairy/eggs, well it was a bit challenging. But Anthony Rose himself helped me through the menu, and suggested the Greek Salad with chicken. It was excellent! Not your usual Greek salad, it had pickles, chickpeas, olives, cucumbers, roasted red onions, and a beautifully grilled breast of chicken. Delicious.   The space is small, and gets smoky as the kitchen is right there. I could see it getting a little chaotic due to the tight space, but I think the comfort food angle is a good one. Although I may not go often because I don't want to break the bank on my daily lunch, I think it's a great addition to the Dupont/Davenport neighbourhood. And I'm not the only one who thinks that, it is constantly packed!   Definitely going back to check out their matzoh ball soup, and maybe I'll cheat one day and go for their burger. It looked amazing."}
{"text":"This place was ok but nothing too special. I'd give it 3.5 stars if I could.   The space is quite nice - very homey and comfortable. Staff were lovely and helpful and they take reservations, which is a big plus.  We ordered milkshakes to start. Both were delicious (creamsicle and butterscotch) but REALLY small (barely a few gulps - I wouldn't order it again). My boyfriend had a few of their mixed drinks and they looked pretty good.   I had the patty melt, which was ok. I probably wouldn't order it again though. There was nothing really wrong with it, I just wasn't wowed by it. It didn't have any special flavour and the meat really got the bun soggy. Fries were pretty good and the portion was plentiful (as was the case for all our dishes except the milkshakes).   My boyfriend had the chicken sandwich. Same thing. It was pretty good but nothing really special - just really big. Nothing wrong with it. Maybe just a bit bland.   My friend had the mac and cheese, which was probably the best of the three dishes. It had a little chill sauce in it to give it some kick but overall it was good but not that remarkable that I would return to the restaurant for it.   All in all it was a nice night but nothing special. I'm in no hurry to return but I would not say no if a friend wanted to check it out."}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting and incredibly overpriced. Greasy diner food for a hefty price. Be prepared to spend a lot of money for small servings and bad quality, or go somewhere else and save your money. The latter is recommended."}
{"text":"Delicious barbecue place! Definitely order the tuna poke bowl + the rabbit are musts and absolutely delicious! Would pass on all the sides and order another appetizer as the apps are the best part, especially the bacon slab.  The brie is delicious, although in the end is just baked brie with some sundried tomato pesto, which can be easily made at home. Do not wear anything that needs to be dry cleaned and be prepared to shower afterwards as you will reek of bbq.. although that isn't the worse thing."}
{"text":"Overpriced. I would likely give 4 stars if it was less expensive but for that price I must be more critical. The wines were $13 a glass.   The atmosphere is unique, but very cramped at long picnic tables. Kind of reminded me of being at a camp cafeteria.   Service was rushed and pushy.   Ceaser salad wasn't very good. Got some corn and broccoli that was pretty awesome but expensive! Jw hen and ribs were tasty but didn't blow me away. Not a lot of meat on the ribs.   I asked for leftovers to be packed up and I was hoping to get these nice pieces of bread that were on the table but for some reason the server didn't include them in my takeaway bag.   Overall experience was \"ok\" but definitely not worth the cost. I won't be returning for dinner but might try the brunch sometime. Hopefully the Ceasers aren't $13"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today! The patty melt was really good! I heard they also have awesome brunches on the weekend! A must try in TO"}
{"text":"If an overpriced, pretentious greasy spoon is what you are looking for, then you have found your place. We made reservations for 6 in advance and got a booth. We were told immediately when settling in that we would have to keep our things close to us as they would be cramming in another couple of people at the end of the booth even though there were other available tables and we were told we would have the whole booth when reserving.   Most of us had the fried chicken (platter or sandwich). The food was mediocre at best and nothing you couldn't get at any greasy spoon for half the price. We found the chicken overcooked and the batter slightly burnt.  Throughout the meal, our server came around several times to ask us if we were finished, even though our plates were clearly not empty. As soon as the last plate was cleared, our cheque was presented. Understand that they specify a 1.5-2 hour sitting time when you make a reservation, but we had not exceeded the 2 hour mark and there were empty tables as it was past the dinner hour at this point.   Overall the food was disappointing and the service was less than welcoming and it felt like we were being rushed out throughout the night."}
{"text":".....At least there weren't any drinks forgotten because these would really be missed. The cocktail menu at BC is super playful and retro.  I mean, when's the last time you saw a Mai Tai or \"punch\" on the menu? Actually, when's the last time you saw root beer mixed with anything, much less with bourbon and bitters. While some may \"poo-poo\" the white trash combo of boxed wine and coke, or a circa 1990 tequila sunrise, I was pretty excited about the old-school theme. Way to take me back to the days I shouldn't have been drinking (aka. When pina colada was the go-to drink). For those not into the classic cocktails, there are also 6 local brews (some in draft, cans or bottle), and a short local and international set of wines. Never one to turn down liquor, especially when it's tied to semi-shameful memories of my youth, we sampled:  Root Beer and Bourbon - 4 Roses, Coster's Blackstrap Bitters  The bitters helped balance the sweetness of the root beer and the bourbon was a surprisingly good pairing.  Bohemian Cooler- Ginger Beer, Elderflower, Rye Im a huge fan of ginger beer and elderflower, so this was a no brainer. I love the peppery tingle of the ginger beer on my tongue and the subtle sweetness of the elderflower. There was also a good amount of citrus flavour going on, making this a perfect refreshing summer drink.   Pina Colada- White Rum, Pineapple Juice, Coconut Milk A far cry from what I remember drinking as a kid- Pina Colada is so much smoother when it's not bogged down with copious amounts of sugar. I think with all that fatty coconut milk, it could have used a touch more lime but it was very creamy and satisfying nonetheless.  Like the drinks, the food menu at BC is equally comforting and fun. Executive chef, Christopher Sanderson, has developed a menu with 4 main sections- starters (crow start), small plates (little crow), larger plates (big crow), sides (eat crow) and desserts. The challenge of choosing for just two people was seriously overwhelming as every single menu option that was persistently calling my name. But with a little help from our server, I finally made my picks. We had:  Crows Sizzling Bacon- Ancho Chili BBQ Sauce  My second favourite dish of the night- the bacon had a variety of pleasant textures going on- really crispy in some corners, and satisfyingly chewy in others. I didn't get any unpleasant grizzel or unrendered fat- just thick cut glorified pork.  The sauce may have been a touch sweet for my liking, but it surely didn't take away from the #foodgasm going on.  Baby Back Ribs with Burst Tomato Pesto (1/2 rack) The clear winner of the night and a welcome savoury escape from all of the sweeter sauces on the table. The ribs were meaty, with a good amount of caramelized bark on them, while the pesto was a burst of refreshing sunshine. With all of those gorgeous summer tomatoes and ample garlic going on, I was truly in flavour heaven.  Rabbit with Honey Butter Hot Sauce (1/2) This dish should come with a warning to beware of rabbit bones. Rabbits are bony little creatures, so while this may look like a gigantic serving for the  1/2 portion, the truth is you gotta work for that meat. Thankfully, it was a worth-while venture. The meat was deliciously tender and juicy, and the sauce had just the right amount of sweetness and heat. It wasn't like a cloying sticky BBQ sauce, it was relatively thin and fabulous soaked into the rustic bread.  Pork and Beans I grew up on pork and beans, but this was a far cry than the canned stuff I always had. I did find the beans a touch al dente for me, and the sauce a little loose, but it was otherwise really well seasoned, and I loved the generous chunks of sausage in there.  PB & J Ice Cream Sandwich I had my heart set on the Smores sandwich, but the table next to us had tried both and suggested the PB & J. Our server also was pretty adamant that we go with the latter, so I reluctantly obliged- and while I didn't try the smores to compare, I was pretty happy with the pick. I think they are using the same blueberry sauce that Rose and Sons puts on their famous bread pudding (at least it tasted like it), as well as a generous smear of the unsweetened peanut butter spread.  So combined with the brioche, the dessert wasn't terribly sweet, leaving room for a massive square of vanilla ice cream. Simple and unfussy, the square shape reminded me of the boxed stuff my thrifty grandma would always buy us kids because it was the cheapest at the store. Grandma never put it on decadent brioche though, so way to give the old-school faves a culinary upgrade. So for 5 dishes and 4 cocktails, the bill came to $125 including tax and tip- very reasonable considering the generous portions of meat we managed to inhale. In summary, Big Crow brought us a nostalgic taste of comfort that....."}
{"text":"Definitely a fun atmosphere - it really is like being at camp. You sit on these picnic benches and you can't help but chat with your neighbors and stare at their food! And something is particularly fun about seeing the chef throwing huge logs onto the fire to cook food. That's how cooking should be done!  Weirdly the best two things we had on the menu weren't really BBQ items. I was a huge fan of the steel head trout poke, which is basically a trout ceviche type dish. Delicious. The other favorite was the grilled corn salad.   Sadly, I wasn't too impressed with the ribs, which looked amazing but weren't all that flavourful. They were trying to be fancy with pesto, but give me a nice tangy, smoky bbq sauce any day of the week!"}
{"text":"The food was great and we loved the dancing cook! The price was ok.  The only down side is the place look, It is small and not very well decorated and you feel that you can't sit there as much as you like:)"}
{"text":"It's a small place so you may have to wait a bit unless you call in a reservation.  Very good comfort/quality diner food with some decent beers on tap or in can.  Not inexpensive but the food is on the top quality end for the style, which is fine."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, both times as a party of two.  Usually a short wait of 20 minutes and we were seated thereafter.  Be prepared to smell like bbq after a visit!  This week, we had salami and eggs-apricot jam, cheddar and jalapeno challah and the griddled brie cornbread-brisket, fried egg, maple syrup, chili sauce off of their brunch menu.  The griddled brie cornbread was easily my favourite.  The brisket was tender, the cornbread soaked up all of the saucy flavour, and the fried egg was just a nice touch for that brunchy feel.  The salami, while still delicious, was a bit more of your standard fare kind of food.  I loved the bread, though.  Last time, we had the plb special melt-bacon, sausage, pickle, fried egg, fried onions, cherry jam.  And that was definitely very filling but also homey.  The decor is very old-school style, cozy, and, slightly diner-ish.  We sat at the bar this time and it was actually kind of nice.  The line cook just served us our dishes since he was so close by.    If you're looking for a smokey, homey, comforting kind of brunch (that is undoubtedly delish), this is your place to go.    Servers are friendly."}
{"text":"Good vibe. Genuinely good service without the hipster attitude one might expect. Excellent food. Started with the pimento toast and then had the fish of the day which was perfectly done. Was already full but luckily did not pass on the sour cherry upside-down cake for dessert."}
{"text":"Yet another recently opened spot in the city serving up a damn good brunch. Located in the Annex on Dupont, just east of Spadina, don't be surprised to find this small little restaurant packed on the weekends.  What went in my belly:  Patty Melt - burger-grilled cheese, fried onions, ff, chili mayo ($15). It was like a burger and grilled cheese in one... the best of both worlds! A juicy patty cooked medium rare sandwiched between buttery rye. Loved it.  Roast Chopped Pork - with grits, poached egg and green sauce ($13). Crispy pieces of juicy pork sat on top of a bed of delicious grits. The dish came with just the right amount of grits - enough for each bite of pork. I enjoyed the addition of the \"green sauce\" which reminded me of the ginger scallion dish that you'd find with steamed Chinese chicken.  Bread Pudding - with wild blueberries ($8). The bread pudding was a little crisp on the outside and the interior was slightly custardy - like a custardy french toast. The blueberry sauce which coated the bread pudding was quite nice and I appreciated the fact that it wasn't overly sweet. It was just enough to satisfy my sweet tooth.  A great way to get my Sunday started!"}
{"text":"Best food I've had in a long time.  Gravy Fries sounds deceivingly simple but mere words and Instagram photos cannot do justice to describe how deliciously satisfying this dish was.    The second time I went with my friend, we probably over did it and ordered too much.  We left feeling a bit over greased in the tummy (okay, nauseous) but the griddled cornbread with brisket & brie (and fried egg, and maple syrup, and chili sauce!) was well worth the pain.    Good for groups?  Hells yeah, more people to share with!  But make a reservation, dining room's tiny.    Good for kids?  I have a toddler.  Would I bring her here?  Definitely not.  Tiny space, open kitchen, just say no, people.  Make it a datenight and leave the kidlets at home.   Mommy needs both hands for her greasy, sloppy patty melt and delicious bourbon!"}
{"text":"You know...I want to write a great review, but I can't. I can write a good review, though.  plus: the food was distinct.  Interesting. con: over $50 for a brunch for 2 and we both left hungry?  I can see why people love Rose and Son's: different offerings, cool music.  But personally speaking, I found in the attempt to offer something different, this place falls short and I just can't quite buy what it is they are selling - and certainly not at those prices.  In their defense, I went expecting more of a traditional diner breakfast/brunch. This is not a diner in the least, so they can't meet my expectation.  Definitely not their fault.  (Le Petite Dejeuner is a good example, for me, of a place that offers a tasty breakfast/brunch, but does so uniquely - I felt that Rose and Sons attempted to do this, but what they offer just isn't for me, I guess).  Portion size and price (and lack of any offerings that aren't so super rich) will keep me from returning, as will the coffee being a strong americano - not a brewed bottomless cup (again, my expectation of brunch).  The tiny $7 milkshake, to me, represents why this place isn't for me:  (and I'm almost too shy to write this):  The twee food and twee vibe just aren't for me.    Our waitress was lovely, absolutely no complaints there.  (Side note: we faced the kitchen and I would love to see some hairnets (or even hair tyed back)  on people in the kitchen, given that the waitresses all have long, flowing hair)."}
{"text":"Don't settle for eggs+bacon+toast again. I had the duck confit for brunch a couple weekends ago. It blew me away. Pretty decadent dining for breakfast, but pretty perfect in my opinion. The salad pairing makes you feel less obese for eating a duck fat soaked duck leg to start your day. Will definitely be egging on my friends to try that dish.   I had the party melt burger (and I tasted the fried chicken club) this week. Great service both times I went. For the party melt I went at 6:15pm on a Thursday and it was empty. I've heard the melt recommended by the waitresses there multiple times, but after tasting it, I'm still on the fence. It's grilled cheese burger with fried onions in a carraway-seed sandwich bread. Nothing more. Pretty good. The burger game (read: Burger's Priest) has gotten so out of hand in TO, so I might've been tainted by unspeakable gluttonies and I can't experience normal burgers the same way anymore. I think it's still a good choice but I'm going to personally suggest the fried chicken club over the party melt.    Cool place, but it's $$$ as far as I'm concerned. $40 for two sandwiches and fries is not right!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food, ambiance and staff here. Had a great $12 dollar cocktail, a phenomenal $16 dollar fish sandwich and loved the fries it came with.   All in all, would highly recommend and would go back."}
{"text":"Wha happened??  The first time I came here for brunch, the food was amazing.  I had the duck leg and hash.  Wow, the hash was so delicious I could have kept eating and eating.  The duck was perfect, so delicious with the egg and sauce.  The side salad was perfect, simple with a bit of vinaigrette to cut all the fat.  The second time, wow, it was so bad.  I had the same thing, because it was so good the first time around.  The second time, the hash was all onion.  It was soggy and gross and basically consisted almost entirely of onion.  I hardly ate any of it.  The salad had a whole bunch of random things in it, cranberries, beets.  It also had a really sour dressing.  Where was that beautiful, simple salad with walnuts and a nice vinaigrette?    The duck was just as good, but my egg was overcooked, and it was drowning in sauce.  It was way too rich without the nice salad to cut it.  It was just plain gross.    That being said, they serve Hinterlands sparkling wine, which is amazing!  And the first time I ate here, I couldn't stop drooling about it for months.  If I were judging based on the second time I was there, I'd give it zero stars, as the food was flat out BAD."}
{"text":"Rose and Sons is our go-to spot when we want an amazing brunch and has become our new favorite for dinner as well! The fried rice is ridiculously good, I could probably eat this every day. The steak was perfectly cooked, and I enjoy the greek chopped salad as well as a little counterbalance to the rest of the greasier options. For brunch you can't beat the cornbread with brisket, oh man it's all the best flavors rolled into one! The drinks are always good and the service is generally attentive. The only downside is of course the small size, but if you make a reservation for dinner or get in early enough for brunch it's worth the little bit of extra planning!"}
{"text":"Have heard great things about this place, so was excited to finally get around to trying it. Went for brunch on a weekday (which is probably the only reason we did not have to wait for a seat) -- vibe was nice; small, intimate, cool place.  I ordered the traditional breakfast - 3 eggs, bacon, hash browns & toast for $13. While the bacon was tasty, it was not worth the price--the portions were quite small and really, the price surprised me -- I guess thats how it is with these trendy-type places in the city. Selection on menu was also quite minimal. There are definitely better brunch places in the area; the food itself was good though. Enjoyed the experience & glad I tried it, but probably won't be back just knowing that there is better in the area."}
{"text":"Went to this place last night with no reservations, they were able to seat us immediately and I have to say, the food was AMAZING!!! The fried chicken is to die for!! Service was fantastic as well! I will defiantly be going back to this place!!!"}
{"text":"I've waited 24 hours for my buttermilk fried chicken club to digest before even attempting to write this review, I'm not lying when I say the size of it is astronomical. In fact, just let go of all your archetypes of the wonderbread, pale chicken breast clubs with strips of microwave bacon; Rose and Sons steps it up to a new level. I think it is the bread. It has to be this thick cheddary herby bread that makes even eating half of this sandwich a trek. The chicken is delicious as fried chicken should be, the bacon is amazingly thick and as I stare at my leftovers for lunch, I'd say the sandwich holds up pretty well on day 2.  We also ordered the onion rings (stellar) and the steak and frites. The steak was very well cooked, tender and definitely worth the higher price tag of menu items.   I love squishy places, so sharing a bench didn't bother me at all and the service was really on point. Make a reservation if you can as even on a Tuesday night there was a bit of a line up and slow turnover (I wasn't moving anywhere fast after eating that sandwich). I love the comfy vibe, right down to the tin water pitchers (I'd love to know where they found those) and the \"make yourself comfortable (if you can)\", teeny bar.   I'll be back. Possibly for brunch. Possibly for that burger inside a grilled cheese."}
{"text":"We tried this place out as it was listed as one of the best brunch places in Toronto on BlogTo and other sites. They have a smaller menu for brunch and I order the brisket on cornbread which was very tasty. My boyfriend ordered the fried chicken and grits which was disappointing as it was a tiny plate with one piece of chicken in a pool of grits. Our friends also got very small plates for the special and the all day breakfast. I would say the portions are small for the price we paid. We paid $50 for two people which is pretty high in comparison to other places that have bigger portions. The waitress was also quite rude and told us to leave after we were done eating since people were waiting for seats. I don't think we would return here."}
{"text":"Definitely had high expectations for this place. The sister shop next door serves delicious brunch, but sadly, this one just didn't do it for me. The food quality + value weren't there. If you're going to charge people 25% than comparable places & decide to specialize in one thing (which for these guys is bbq) you better make sure you've got that down to a science. They don't. The medium-rare steak was well-rubbery-done, the ribs were dry and salty. Quite sad because we really wanted to like them. The service was fantastic and the staff are really nice. The potato salad - two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"My Review of Rose and Sons is positive. The place is intimate with a hip urban atmosphere. The staff are all young and peppy and look like they're actually enjoying themselves. The 90's theme music was great, the staff really nice and the boy cooks, super cute, ladies!   I ordered the  poached pear and yoghurt-peanut and poppy granola, maple syrup for $9.The pancakes we split as an appetizer and they were delicious! My only critique and the reason I chose the yogurt, was it looked and proved to taste, like they cook everything on the same grill and meat flavour was present in the pancakes. I am a vegetarian so I tried to avoid anything fried on the same grill. Other than the taste of meat, they were immensely delectable.  The staff was really nice. We sat at the bar and even the chefs came over to ask how everything was.   The yogurt parfait was insane! The poached pear tasted like apple pie and the granola was a perfect crunch, a nice variation from your average granola.   With a tea and latte my total, with tip was $25.00.   I give this place a 5 star rating.  An extra point for taking my number and texting me when the table was ready. The place is small so I am assuming there is usually a wait."}
{"text":"Date night with my meat and potato hubby, who looooves BBQ. Well, we both do.  It really has that wood lodge with heaters and blankets feel.  Superb service. Owner, Anthony Rose was doting.  It's communal seating so we made conversation with two chefs next to us. They even shared their food with to help us decide!  We ordered:  Cream soda, purple Jesus and white wine - ok but nothing outstanding.  Baby back ribs - they're not fall off the bone, a little chewy, slightly disappointed. Though, the side dish of potato salad is great.  Duck Confit Burrito - delicious. Cherry sour cream gives it a nice touch.  Split Pea Stew - standout. My favourite childhood dish. Ham hock was so tender and the stew had that smoky, woodsy flavour. The brisket was good but not necessary. I could eat this dish every day!  Bakermans (aka Hello Dollies) and brownie squares - comfort dessert, nothing out of the ordinary here but thoroughly satisfying.  We came out smelling like a smoke house and were high on comfort.  Would return and recommend."}
{"text":"Awesome find. Yelp you win again. We hit them up for late lunch- incredible. Tiny little place we sat at the bar and had an awesome chat with the chef and waitress who make an awesome duo. Can't say enough how great the food is. We had the bleu burger and fried chicken club-- but I am confident everything else is just as amazing. Also the special fried rice was ordered at least five times just as we sat there. Peanut butter Milkshake was the perfect ending creamy soft serve, hot salted peanuts on top with a drizzle of peanut butter sauce -- we will be back.   No filter.. One of the strongest fried chicken sammies I've consumed. First it's a fried thigh! I think Americans are the only ones obsessed with the breast. Thighs are ridiculously juicy (see the video) also thick Canadian cheddar, housemade relish and a spicy kimchi-of sorts-veggie shred up top. Buttermilk bun was magically griddled, it sopped up all the juices without getting soggy. I didn't drop one drop. THE FRIES- hot crisp, and served with a surprise of either garlic mayo(mine) spicy mayo(his) or smoke paprika mayo. Just great food awesome service."}
{"text":"Get in while you can as this place is just on the verge of becoming a yuppy infested nightmare.  Having said that, the food is fantastic, the beer is great and the fact that it's a shed married to a steel shipping container only pushes it over the top for me. Brilliant.  I had the Rabbit, Miami Ribs, Grits and Broccoli, washed it down with a seasonal Doppelbock from Beau's and capped off the meal with the Lemon Tart and a glass of Milk.  The Rabbit was like a very well done, moist piece of chicken. Not gamey like rabbit can normally be and the sauce, while not spicy, had a great kick. The Ribs were surprisingly more meat than bone (I'm looking at you Electric Mud) and came out tender and juicy. The Grits were \"meh\" at best. They really tasted more like pieces of feta cheese in an unidentifiable gravy but the Broccoli with cheese sauce was a nice side. Finally, the Lemon Tart was a meringue without the meringue. Tart and full of citrus with just enough sugar to remind you it's a dessert.  The winterizing process they go through to keep this place warm is outstanding making the space feel more like a really small ski lodge than a restaurant. Warm blankets sit on the benches with over head heaters blasting the cold off of you. All the food is cooked over an open fire giving the place that wonderful BBQ smokehouse scent.  Really, the only downside I see to this place is when it gets too busy, the patrons start to get obnoxious, this isn't Crow's fault because you can only cook so many things at the same time. I would suggest that if you are going to a small place where they take time and effort to make your meal, you allow them the time to make it and enjoy yourself rather than take it out on the servers and surrounding guests.  Oh, and the \"alley\" you take to get here isn't sketchy. It's well lit and maintained."}
{"text":"Delicious BBQ joint. The atmosphere is lovely, fantastic service and friendly staff all around! Food was really great. Menu is a little difficult to navigate, so be sure to ask your server how much is 'too much'. A little loud for the seating style, but fun! Get the ice cream sandwich."}
{"text":"Visited this place for Sunday brunch before heading back to the States. Apparently this is a local fav and is one that my nephew frequents every so often. Ordered the All Day Breakfast which was recommended to me by the server which included 3 eggs made your way, their own version of hash browns and sausages which were not what I expected (one long sausage split down the middle and looking like a long skinny hot dog).  They only have two types of toast - wheat or whole grain and was not expecting thick cut toast with un-traditional jam (jam was sour tasting but unique.)  Needless to say, I ate my wheat toast minus any jam which did not cut it for me. The highlight were the shmultz hash browns and eggs. This place did not rock me but was quaint and a fav with the locals."}
{"text":"Showed up 5 minutes after open for brunch on a Sunday and there were already 4-5 tables sat, we were seated right away. Thoroughly enjoyed the duck confit, and look forward to returning at a time when I can try the cocktails."}
{"text":"The wait time is worth it, plus they take your cell number and text you when the table is free so if you don't want to stand around you can wander. Plus the host / servers are so personable and just want to share their love of food, so they're very accommodating and apologetic about wait times. Once when my friends and I experienced a particularly long wait, they brought us all soft serve ice cream sundaes with chocolate sauce, on the house!   The cornbread and brie brisket is phenomenal. A generous slice of cornbread, topped with melted brie, fall apart brisket, chili sauce, maple syrup, amazing caramelized onions and a perfectly cooked sunny side up egg. And the milkshakes are great, small servings but any bigger would be excessive. I'd recommend the peanut butter shake."}
{"text":"Came here for a lunch the other day. Rose and Son's interior is cool and unique. While it is small, me and my friend had no trouble finding a seat. The menu had a lot of variety. I got the scrambled eggs and bacon, and my friend got the fried chicken sandwich. The prices were a bit high, especially for what i got, but the experience was worth it. In the end, the food was pretty good and the restaurant provides a nice intimacy. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Really sad to see some reviews bashing the service here - I've been coming since they opened and have proudly watched the Anthony Rose empire expand over the last four years or so. Rose and Sons is the OG, and has earned its rep as a brunch must.  Nothing is better for brunch (the coca cola brisket cornbread....) and I've always had really excellent service. An anecdote from one of my more recent visits illustrates this: We were sitting up the bar, and struck up a conversation with an employee behind the bar. I was gushing about how much I love R&S, and then started waxing nostalgic about a warm apple-cheddar-raddicho salad that was on the brunch menu 3+ years ago, that I miss deeply... so what did he do? He went to the back and printed out the recipe for me, so I can make it at home.   Service like that is what'll keep me coming back for another 4+ years, even if they do keep taking my faves off the menu (RIP grilled cheese & tomato soup)."}
{"text":"I wanted to like Rose and Sons. I really did. After viewing countless photos of their food on Instagram, I finally found the gumption to make a reservation and headed out with a friend.  Here's what we ate:  1) Broccoli with Garlic and Chili  Man, this dish totally bombed for me. The broccoli was overcooked, lacking the desired bit of crunch you would hope for in a blanched green vegetable. The whole cloves of garlic had a boiled quality to them, and the hot sauce lacked spice and acidity. We both agreed that we wouldn't order this again, though our waiter said it was a favourite.  2) Cornbread with Hot Sauce and Maple Syrup  Our waiter recommended this as our second appetizer as it complemented the broccoli. The corn bread had a crispy exterior from the griddle action, and a crumbly centre. I personally found that the hot sauce and maple syrup neutralized each other, and didn't contribute any depth of flavour to the cornbread which was good enough on its own.  3) Lemon Roasted Steelhead Trout with Dumplings and Sweet Peas  This was the best item of the entire meal. The fish was cooked perfectly. The addition of young garlic shoots added a beautiful crunch. The dumplings were soft and supple, and picked up the flavour of the roasted lemon nicely. All around, this was the winner!  4) Fried Chicken, Blue Cheese Wedge Salad  The Stockyard sets the bar for fried chicken in Toronto, and that's all I say about that ;)  While dinner was not mind blowing, I would consider brunching here on the account of  the so many positive reviews listed below."}
{"text":"Crowded but friendly atmosphere. We were a party of two on Saturday at noon and didnt wait too long luckily but be prepared to wait outside!   I had the roast pork sandwich which was very tasty. Especially loved the sour cherry sauce.  My friend had the duck confit which was very good as well. its a cute neighbourhood find."}
{"text":"The food here is phenomenal, and you're able to see everything that goes on in the kitchen.  I wanted to shave off a point because it's so expensive, but the quality of the food more than makes up for it.  My friend and I split two of their burgers which were reasonably priced and incredibly delicious.  Can't miss this little Toronto gem!"}
{"text":"Great hipster bbq joint...swordfish great, rabbit poor, jw bird was tender, ribs were good, ribeye great...sadly service was a bit slow but they must've been short staffed on a tuesday"}
{"text":"Friendly, down to earth staff, chilled out Annex-style atmosphere and a home cooked, delicious, I need my stretchy-pants meal....this place has it all!  Came here on a Saturday night around 8PM with a friend that was visiting from Hamilton. She was a little skeptical at first, but as soon as we walked in and were greeted by Anthony Rose in a friendly manner, both Anthony and myself took the liberty of convincing her to stay-put and dine.   Apparently this was an unusually quiet night for the resto, but we were seated right away and informed reservations would come in handy the next time around.   Once settled, each with a crisp glass of white wine in hand, I opted for the coca-cola braised brisket, double baked potato with bacon and a side of brocc, while my friend went for the rye-grilled cheese with a hamburger patty sandwiched between the carbs with caramelized onions, plus french fries & spicy mayo. The food was downright delicious, the brisket melting in my mouth with just enough gravy drenching the side of greens. The baked potato had chunks of bacon and I ended up eating everything including the skin. It was that tasty. My at first hesitant friend, savvied up all items on the place. Dare I say more?  Despite the need for yoga pants at this point in time, we were both craving something more. A slice of dense bread pudding with just the right amount of field blueberries served piping hot out of the oven? But of course!   Did I mention Mr. Rose made the effort to remember our names the entire evening, as well as sit down and catch a few words with us while we dined? Nice touch.    I believe the menu changes every so often and with that being said, I will be back very soon to dine at this newly opened Annex-gem!"}
{"text":"This is the most overpriced Jewish deli style restaurant that I have ever been to. The  food was decent but the prices are ridiculous. A half a pound of pastrami with 4 measly slices of rye bread and 2 Of those slices were the ends of the rye For the cost $21. Very pretentious pricing for a neighbourhood type diner. They call it jew food on the store window the only thing they are jewing are their customers. Coming from Montreal and of Jewish background myself I know what a real non pretentious Jewish deli is...  The seating style is like Montreal Schwartz's where you sit with strangers, only far less seats and not the most comfortable. A little hole 250 square feet restaurant. A pound of Schwartz's smoke meat is less than $20... Sons and Roses is trying too hard to make Jewish food hipster cool that they think they can excuse themselves on the elite pricing. They are shaming the Jewish community .   $50 bucks for lunch, included 1 French fry, 1 cole slaw, 1 karnutzel, 1 can of cherry coke, and half a pound of pastrami with four little slices of bread. And This was shared with one other person. Do not go here if you are hungry!"}
{"text":"Went here for weekend brunch. Here are my thoughts:  FOOD: Amazing! Ordered the PLB Special Melt with a side of hash. The PLB is a must-try! The bacon and sausage in the PLB is not your average streaky bacon and breakfast sausage - it is definitely high quality. The egg was also cooked to perfection - not oily, no crispy bits. To top it off, it comes with a yummy cherry jam. My partner got the peanut butter shake which was also very tasty, and as someone else mentioned, more like soft serve ice cream. Thought it was a little pricy for the quantity of the shake, but ok if you want to splurge a little.  BUILDING/DECOR: Kind of cool, cozy, the epitome of 'hipster'. A little on the smaller side so if you go on a weekend, make sure to go before noon or you will have to wait.   SERVICE: No complaints. Our server was very friendly, as are the chefs. They made a mistake on our order twice which meant waiting and getting our meals at different times and our hash got cold by the time the main was ready, but they more than made up for it by comping our shake. That gesture was much appreciated.  We will definitely return for another delicious brunch!"}
{"text":"Our latest two visits to one of our favourite dining spots made something very clear in our minds: Anthony Rose has abandoned his namesake (and first) restaurant in pursuit of new flavours of the month. Fellow diners and I couldn't help but note that the quality and flavour of food we had come to expect at R&S was just not what it used to be...  Fish was underdone and soggy and the famous fried chicken club left a flavour void -- and I must note that this sandwich was once the main reason for us visiting!   Not to say that the restaurant isn't good -- it's just not great as it once used to be."}
{"text":"Food wasn't good and menu was definitely over priced and overflowing with hipster vibes. Ugh.  My food came with a poached egg. I got a messy grainy puddle. Server asked my partner if he had any questions while he was looking at the menu and he unfortunately honestly answered that \"we're curious about the onion jam\", to which she cuntily responded \"what about it.\"  Pass.   I actually hate this place. Even the posers waiting outside look and act like losers. Walk on down to Playa Cabana instead. You'll get good food and atmosphere for the same price."}
{"text":"Hit up this place about a year ago with my family to celebrate my moms birthday. We were looking for something not Italian since that's what we always tend to settle for when it comes to birthdays we were fairly impressed. Don't be fooled this is not your usual typical diner as it looks like on the outside and inside, this place sells some mean food. I purchased their fancy cheese melt grill cheesy like burger since they offer that and a tallboy of beer or like $20 delicious! Also ordered a plate of pork fried rice to share with the table and had a bite of everyone else's food at the table. Simply neat unique take on a burger and fries I sure enjoyed mine. A bit pricy but a busy spot to be especially on a Saturday night and you really do feel the food after, it'll send you in a food comma for days. Overall I'd give it a try and see for yourself!"}
{"text":"Rose and Sons: Rating is based on food alone, can get very crowded and staff at times can be a bit much, but nice local vibe and amazing food  Big Crow: Great set-up, was surprised how well the outdoor space transferred into a winter time patio. Great comfort food. But SERIOUSLY....what is with the instant coffee..it is undrinkable, and limits my ability to nurse a hangover there...although the caesars almost make up for the lack of coffee."}
{"text":"I don't really understand.  Every other restaurant in Toronto felt warm and inviting due to the friendliness of the staff.  Here the staff was warm and friendly but it came off as fake.  I had the feeling they were trying to hurry us out of our table to fit another seating in for brunch.  True friendliness is tough to fake.  The food is alright, a lot of creativity that goes nowhere in the end.  The flavors don't congeal nor contrast.  It's like giving a child a set of crayons and then waiting to see what they produce: most likely it's heavy and a combination of lots of different colors.  Convenient to my hotel and better than the usual hotel-y brunches although at the same inflated price.  That's the level of my endorsement."}
{"text":"Went with 2 friends for milkshakes, based on an outstanding review found in blog.to.   we tried it out,  and were completely dissatisfied.     The milkshakes were $7.00 each and literally 250ml in size..  Not even real ice cream... Just soft serve.   Pathetic.  AVOID.     I have never had such a terrible experience..   Blog.to must have been paid off to post that this place has the best milkshakes in the city."}
{"text":"Food was really good. The seating was horrible. We were sandwiched in between to other groups on benches, so we had to get them to move (mid-dinner) if someone wanted to go to restroom or leave. Unpleasant enough not to go back."}
{"text":"Tried this place after walking by many times. Got a drink without realizing it was 12 dollars. :/ Tried the PL sandwich. It was soooooo greasy and not easy to eat. Plus I was lucky enough to get a hair on mine (cook said it was from the brush they used to baste/coat the meat). I would probably not go again."}
{"text":"Cute setup of the restaurant, nice ambient and really good music playing. The waitress was really nice and explained the menu to us. I like how they have the little water pitcher for each table, so we never have to wait for water to refill. The coffee tasted fresh, I liked it. We ordered the all day breakfast and the \"lox bagel\" platter. They were both different from what we would expect from a normal breakfast place, but better! They cook some shredded onions with the hash brown, the bagel was very tasty. They really kicked it up a notch for these 2 dishes, we were both very satisfied with this place, will def come back again! Maybe the menu can be of a wider selection and the coffee can have refills."}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for good cornbread, and when you grill it to golden crispness, top it with melting Brie and tender house-smoked brisket, drizzle with maple syrup and sriracha, you make me a very happy woman. And David was an equally happy man with his excellently-executed fried chicken resting on a bed of delicately creamy grits, finished with a poached egg and a fresh, herby green sauce. If you want a seat in the tiny (cosy?), spare diner-inspired place, get there early. We really enjoyed watching the action in the kitchen as we sipped our coffee sitting at the bar."}
{"text":"Big Crow has an awesome summer camp/Canadiana vibe that you can't help but love.  From the communal style long picnic tables, the Hudson Bay striped water jugs, the big stacks of wood everywhere to the big smokey bbq, you just don't feel like you're sitting in downtown Toronto. And you are essentially sitting outside, which is also quite lovely. The shipping containers add a bit of an urban feel, as does the really load, slow moving freight train 12 feet away. (it's actually more funny than annoying)  It's super easy to make a reservation on line and we were seated as soon as we arrived.  The drink list is very cool and inventive.  Everything we tried was surprisingly good and the service was great.  Our food was served family style, read \"feast-style\" and was ready quite quickly and consumed even more so.   The steel head trout poke was a stand-out dish.  The combination of flavours and textures was truly delicious and inspired. The Caesar salad: not so much.  The croutons were great but it was sooo over-dressed that it was really goopy and unappealing.  The jerk chicken wings were moist and smokey with just a little bite to them - really good.  The swordfish was nice - a little overdone but the mango salsa made up for it.  The miami ribs were really overdone - chewy, rubbery and disappointing although the tzatziki that accompanied was very good.  We all loved the sticky, sweet very moist rabbit.  We should have ordered a whole one and skipped the very expensive, not very delicious lobster.  Although the lobster looked fantastic, the tail meet was mushy and flavourless and the claws were a bit rubbery.  We often grill lobster at home and it usually has a lot more flavour.    The sides we tried were both great: The potato salad and the corn salad - really yummy and looked wonderful all heaped on the plate.  We also liked how everything was served with big hunks of delicious bread to sop up anything that was left on the serving plate.    Sadly, we were all too full to try desert but I know we will be back.  - It may become a rather brisk place to dine once the cooler weather hits.  Hopefully they are stocking up on Hudson Bay blankets."}
{"text":"1: Poor 2: OK 3: Good 4: Very Good 5: Excellent  Food: 3 Service: 4 Ambiance: 4 Overall: 3.5  What better way is there to enjoy a nice warm weather than to look for a restaurant with an awesome patio? Well, what about a restaurant that is JUST a backyard patio? sounds interesting enough for me to check out.  With Rose & Sons popularity steadily increasing over time, people couldn't stop talking about Big Crow when it first opened up. It took me long enough but I finally managed to make my way over to Big Crow with couple of my friends. As usual I took a look at the menu online before the visit but honestly I couldn't really decide on what I wanted to try for some reason. So this doesn't happen very often, but I decided to see what I would feel like once I got there (gasp)  Even with google map active on my iphone in one hand, Big Crow was very easy to miss. This might be because I've never been to Rose & Sons yet and I was distracted by my hunger. Anyways, it is hidden away so make sure to keep your eyes open.  Overall, the restaurant is set up with wooden communal tables which gives it a winter lodge feel. They serve backyard barbeque food that is meant to be shared by couple people.  Ordered: Mai Tai  * Rums, lime, almond syrup and triple sec * This was served in a small pitcher and gave us around 4 glasses * Def strong cocktail which I really enjoyed with the food   Ordered: Smoked mozzarella and roast garlic bread 5/5  * Loaf of bread with roasted garlic and mozzarella cheese for $9 * You guys know I am pretty picky with bread.. but this I couldn't get enough of * Bread was just chewy enough and filled with so much awesome goodness * Roasted garlic embeded within the bread give it so much flavor * I would go back just for this bread   Ordered: Steel head trout poke 5/5  * With peanuts, chili, ginger, soy, furikake and chips for $14 * This was strongly recommended by our server and we decided to give it a try * I wasn't sure what to expect with this dish but I loved it * Steel head trout was fresh and just enough of the light dressing didn't over power   Ordered: Jerk Chicken Wings 3/5  * 5 wings on a skewer for $13 * Served with green sauce on top and piece of bread * Chicken wings were perfectly cooked, nice and juicy * This would be good to share as an appetizer between few people * But again, it was not my favorite   Ordered: Baby backs 3/5  * Served with burst tomato pesto, $16 for 1/2 and $29 for full rack * We ordered half rack of the ribs since it seemed to be a popular item * I wasn't too impressed with the ribs, found it to be a little dry * It is a personal preference but I don't really like pork ribs * This was more of the dry rub ribs with tomato pesto on top   Ordered: Side of Grilled corn salad 5/5  * You can order 1 side for $4, 2 for $7 and 3 for $10 * I ordered Grilled Corn Salad with queso fresco and chili mayo * I was so glad I ordered this corn salad * One of the best corn salad I've ever had, it wasn't too heavy on dressing   Ordered: Smores Ice Cream Sandwich 3/5  * With thick layer of vanilla ice cream, served on a brioche bun for $7 * This was something I was excited about but didn't live up to my expectation * I loved the idea but found the brioche bun to be a little too dry * Would've preferred bun to be softer in texture or more so dessert like  Summary: Overall I enjoyed my dining experience at Big Crow. I loved the idea of backyard patio barbeque atmosphere with open kitchen concept and the style of food they serve. It is a nice place to 'getaway' because I def did not feel like I was in Toronto downtown. I would go back to get the garlic bread and perhaps try couple more of their appetizers. I heard they installed heaters for winter time so def do give it a try if you are into the idea."}
{"text":"I came here a couple months ago for brunch with two my friends. We spoke to the hostess who took our name and number via iPad and told us we'd be texted when a seat came up. We decided to grab a Caesar at a nearby bar and after 30-40minutes later we got our table.  Let me tell you this, it's worth the wait. Think southern comfort brunch and you won't be disappointed. We ordered the PLB special melt, the cornbread brisket, and the patty melt burger with the extra fried egg and bacon. HOLY CRAP IT WAS AMAZING!!   I've brunched a lot during my last three summers and this place has jumped ontop by top 3 brunch places. And the notion was shared amongst my other two friends as well.   PS the Caesar is delicious and comes with a pepperoni stick!"}
{"text":"Despite the fact I've been wanting to go here since it opened, I was totally underwhelmed. They get a star for nostalgia because I was a huge fan and long-time patron of People's (which frankly had much better food), and one star for nice decor and fairly friendly staff.  The food was not good.  Listen folks, if you need that much butter and oil in the cooking process to add flavour to the food, it probably means there isn't much flavour.  The fried chicken club had good components, but was overwhelmed by bread that was so saturated in butter I couldn't even finish a third of it. And I *love* butter.   We sat at the counter and watched them cook and despite growing up with classic french food I have never seen so much butter used to prepare food in my life. It was gross.  Will give the Crows Nest a try - tried to go tonight but the staff were weirdly discouraging and convinced us to stay at Rose and Sons. Won't be back, but a special thanks from Dr Berenstein and Cardiologists everywhere."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying I LOVED this spot! I'll go on to say I hate YELP, despise it...I have never written a YELP review, but was inclined to help out a new business as I am a NYC business owner and know that this ridiculous site actually makes a difference, so here I am. I visited Toronto with a close friend who is from there. We basically spent the 3 days eating, shopping and seeing the sites, art, etc. What a great city with tons of good food. The last morning of the trip someone recommended we eat at Rose & Sons. This was undoubtedly one of the BEST brunches I have EVER had. Not only was it a great atmosphere, I loved the informal setting, the writing down my own order (whoever complained about this in a former review needs to get a grip) and the owner was warm and inviting. We had an infant and a four year old with us and they were easy and accommodating with the kids. Brunch , in my experience, is often rushed, loud, bustling with people waiting on line who haven't had their coffee yet and are not in great moods. This was the opposite. We waited a bit, but we were warned that there would be a wait, that's expected. Once sitting, there was no one hovering, the staff were friendly, the food came out promptly, but not too soon so we could enjoy our  delicious coffee drinks and fresh squeezed juices. The food was out of this world! I had the best bacon I have ever had, bread buttered to perfection, and we all shared a side of granola and warm pear that was heavenly. I would highly highly recommend this place to anyone and everyone and look forward to a return trip. That being said, this is a new spot...all businesses have their off day now and then. Give it a break  - people who need to have their voices heard and need to vent...if you had a not so great experience, TELL THE OWNER OR MANAGER! Believe me they will hear it a lot better and will be grateful for your feedback rather than staying anonymous and venting what you feel was done to you. Rose & Sons gets a big thumbs up from a nice New Yorker with high standards and a love of brunch :)"}
{"text":"My best friend and I went into Rose and Sons for lunch because we'd read positive reviews. Enter Spencer, a server so abrasive that it bordered on surly. That neither of us knew the history of Anthony Rose (or sons) must've irritated him. I don't think Spencer smiled once in the hour we were there and he provided as little information on the menu items as possible when asked.  Spencer seemed reasonably polite to everyone else. Of course, they were middle-aged, so he might simply have assumed that as twenty-somethings, we'd prefer to be treated like gum on the bottom of his shoe. However, I've never liked the hipster approach and I spent plenty of time speculating with my best friend about the reasons Spencer might've assumed otherwise. When another server came with extra maple syrup and a pleasant tone, we experienced a brief moment of hope, but it didn't last long.  I could've ignored Spencer's attitude if the food had been any good, but it was far from it. The Patty Burger Melt was filling and that's the best I can say for a $19 meal. The bread was burnt, the meat tasted entirely of grease, and the fries had too much salt. My best friend made the better choice with the pancakes--one of very few vegetarian options. I tried a bite: the ricotta and sour cherries were a delicious blend and the pancakes were dense, if you like that. The quantity and presentation didn't justify the $12 price tag either. I guess we have to pay Anthony Rose's rent.  Not that Rose and Sons is prepossessing by any measure: we nearly wrote it off as a random greasy spoon when we passed by and the space is minimalist at best, with only a handful of booths. If I'm paying for the neighbourhood, however, I'd rather go anywhere Anthony Rose's hands aren't.  tl;dr Terrible customer service and overpriced, decidedly average food have soured me on the entire brand."}
{"text":"5 for food. 4 for service.   Came here with a friend. They have this policy where they can't seat you until your entire party arrives (which I don't agree with, esp given that the food takes forever to arrive). I HATED the cafeteria-style benches that the majority of the place is filled with. We were sitting on the edge and we had to get up to let patrons in the middle leave, and then for new patrons to get it. So side note: use the bathroom before you sit down.   As I mentioned, the food takes a while to arrive, even by Toronto brunch standards. I ordered the cola brisket on cornbread and don't get me wrong- it was DELICIOUS. But I'm not sure I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Has a backyard campfire type atmostphere which I dig is \"cool\"  Place definetely overcharges for it's food. I can make this stuff just as good at home. The ribs were good but would have prefered them to be saucy instead of dry. The owner servered them to us and made it sound like it was the second coming, but I have had way better ribs dude. The jerk chicken wings were nice though.   My real beef with this place was I don't like the people that work there, too hipster for their own good. The server we had I didn't like her, especially when I questioned her on why they are pulling a \"Grand electric\" by not taking credit cards when clearly their POS is set to do so. Your place isn't that popular to be doing something like that.   Any restaurant that chooses to take this approach will not see a return visit from me."}
{"text":"Upon walking through a short alley, you will come upon a cabin like building. Once inside, you are transported to the great outdoors. Long communal tables, wool blankets, animal hides, and even a smoky smell through the air.   The menu has lots of bbq and smoked meats. We decided to share a smoked mozzarella and brisket roast garlic bread- with a fried egg and whiskey onions, and mustard. This was a large sandwich, with lots of juicy smoked brisket and a generous portion of mozzarella.   Service is friendly, and food arrives in a reasonable time. Heat lamps keep you cozy while dining in one of the coolest atmospheres, and whisks you away from the bustling city."}
{"text":"Upon first glance this place seemed to have some promise, but its execution is severely lacking. Located in the building Peoples Diner used to be, there were big shoes to fill. Peoples was a great Diner with good service and good food at reasonable prices. Enter Rose and Sons..  Overly complicated recipes,  VERY small portions at top dollar pricing. Im happy to pay for good food, and I applaud trying to revamp classic recipes. I lose faith when value has left the equation. Then to have lackadaisical service, dirty tables and burnt chicken on top.. No thanks. There are many great Diners in Toronto this is Definitely not one of them. Eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"Went for dinner, not brunch.  It seems like a lot of the positive reviews are for brunch.  Not bad but definitely not worth the price.  Our starters were good and were decent value - all the serving sizes here are enormous.  I think I would go back, but maybe for 2 people I would order 3 starters and share them.  The mains were much more expensive and not nearly as good.  The steak, for example, was almost $30 and actually kind of sucked."}
{"text":"This place is terrible.  We ordered the milkshakes based on the blogto review of them being the best in Toronto and boy was blogto wrong.    The milkshake was nothing it soft serve with some peanuts on top and a bit of peanut butter.  And the worst part about it was the size.  I bet the entire shake was about 250ml.  The definition of tiny.  I mean I've never seen such a small shake for the high price of $7.00.  I won't be back that's for sure."}
{"text":"The atmosphere at Big Crow is great, with big communal tables, outdoor dining and the smell of smoke. That said, our dinner was hit and miss. For sides, we ordered the grilled corn salad and potato salad. Both were tasty and light. The proteins was where our meal really fell down. We ordered the jerk chicken wings which were overcooked, had little jerk flavour and the pineapple was an afterthought. Our second protein was the baby back ribs (full order). These too were overcooked (burnt to a crisp) and the burst tomato pesto was bone cold, which made for a weird combination against the warm ribs. It tasted as if the pesto was brought straight out of the fridge and dolloped on top of the pork. We didn't try any dessert but had some good drinks (cider and the Kensington IPA)."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. Environment is very cool. Service was excellent. The ribs and sausage were very good but the bacon was absolutely incredible. Thick-cut and smothered in homemade BBQ sauce, I'd say it was better than the ribs.  For dessert, the ice cream sandwiches are a must-have. We went for the pb&j but the s'mores one looked equally delicious. Will definitely be coming back soon."}
{"text":"I came here with some friends after an afternoon at Casa Loma.  We wanted a snack and heard that this place had some of the best milkshakes around.  The place is small, so blink and you just might miss it.  Parking is not widely available so keep that in mind when you decide to try it.   The inside was not much bigger than the outside.  I would say it could comfortably hold maybe 8 parties if they were small parties of 2-4.  There was also seating at the bar.  The place looks like they make a spectacular cocktail, but alas we didn't try any on this particular afternoon.  The inside is also very hipster, but that is not necessarily a bad thing.   So, I ordered a peanut butter milkshake.  I loved that they put peanuts on top, but I wish they would've take the peel off the nuts before putting them in my milkshake.  I know there is supposed to be flavor in that part of the nut, but I don't generally eat it and it kind of messed up my texture.  The milkshake was very thick.  I would say it was the thickest I've ever had.  So if you like thick, this is the place for you, but if you don't you've been warned.  The only problem with it being so thick was that it was also heavy, so I couldn't finish it all.  My friends had chocolate which he described as very strong.  My other friend has sour cherry which was a seasonal special not listed on the menu.  I think she was actually the happiest with her milkshake. Overall, I thought the place was adorable and I would definitely try it again."}
{"text":"I was impressed.  My first visit here was memorable. The chef worked with me to give me a mix of something on the menu and a bit of my own creation. I like when chef work with their patrons; it means a lot."}
{"text":"Excellent food and drinks. Shared the shrimp and grits as well as the buttermilk chicken with mac and cheese. Had the cocktail special - it was incredible. No mint julep as advertised on their wall, but we ordered something else that was good."}
{"text":"Most amazing corn dog in a million miles. Felt at home!"}
{"text":"Cozy brunch spot with friendly staff and unlimited coffee refills! Although there was a plethora of meat options from the deli to choose from, my friend and I both ate the All day Breakfast with fried brussels sprouts - AMAZING! Heavenly, garlicky, crispy... would definitely recommend for meat-lovers as well but always good to have a veggie option!"}
{"text":"This place is a perfect example of the famous hole in the wall restaurant. They have seating for about four parties at a time plus four bar seats. Everything is clean and well organized to maximize the use of their space. We came in for a mid afternoon snack in the form of a milkshake and a coke.  The milkshakes were thick and awesome. My chocolate was exceedingly strong. My wife had an unadvertised special of sour cherry variety. The sour cherry was flavorful and delicious. All in all I'd definitely return for dinner at some point as the snack was perfect."}
{"text":"Overpriced mediocrity  We had brunch at this place on Sunday... first and last time for me. After waiting for nearly an hour, we got seated in this very loud and very cramped cantina-like table. It didn't take long to place our orders and when they arrived, one order was wrong. It was corrected, but the server seemed less than happy about being caught out. Later, they brought out the brownie surprise - ice cream plonked down on the brownie. But it was LOADED with peanuts! I mean, Peanuts! At that price I'd expect something less mundane. When I pointed out that peanuts could be rather dangerous, she snapped at me, saying that it's the customer's responsibility to advocate for themselves. (She didn't use those words, of course.) She then went into the cooking area and spread the word about the mouthy customer. Yup, I got the look alright, from all the staff. Anyway, I was not impressed with this place at all. It was loud and mediocre.  Definitely not worth the wait."}
{"text":"I have been a huge fan of Rose and Sons for several years. My favourite restaurant in the city. Brunch, dinner, drinks - always had a wonderful experience. Recommended it highly to friends, and always looked forward to going there.   When I saw that the restaurant was closing and re-opening as a deli of some sort, I was worried, but I trusted Anthony Rose to do something great. No matter what I had tried on the old menu, it was always inspired and well executed, so he had earned that trust. I have worked in several kitchens and know good food, and I thought that someone who had done so well, who was so clearly a gifted executive chef, would have a great plan in mind.  Unfortunately, this reboot is a HUGE miss. The menu went from broad and eclectic, featuring lots of unique offerings, to small and simple. That in itself is not bad - a small and focused menu can bring with it some upsides. Typically, lower prices (less food preparation required, more efficient kitchen, less storage and spoilage of ingredients) and higher quality offerings (cooks can master a few dishes, ingredients can be prioritized). However, neither of these things have happened - in fact, the new menu is MORE expensive and the execution is actually worse.   For a quick example, before, you could get a patty melt meal for $16 or $17. That included a unique dish that you couldn't get anywhere else (grilled cheese using caraway rye with a medium done chuck patty in between) with excellent in-house fries. Now, $17 gets you a Reuben, which is smaller than the patty melt, and no sides.  Now, if the quality was there, this might be okay (if still overpriced), but it manages barely above average. Mind you, it isn't bad - I enjoyed my sandwich, but it is not anything special. This also held true for the Rachel.  Honestly, the Reuben is worse than what you can get at New Yorker Deli on Bay, and that comes with fries or latkes + a pickle for $14. I have had many superior Reubens and Rachels, and they have all been less expensive.   So, even though it was over-priced, I added some sides to the sandwiches. Gone are the in-house fries which were some of the best in the city. The old disco/party fries dish was a STEAL - amazing fresh veg and a great sauce, and delicious side mayos.  In their place are gigantic rectangles that seem to mostly exist in order to burn the inside of your mouth (crispy on the outside, poor seasoning, and then meh fluff inside). Worst of all, I always used to enjoy watching the open kitchen. During this last visit, with these new fries, I saw the guy in the kitchen bring up two plastic bags of them and just open the top of the bag. Now, I can't know 100% for certain, but having worked several years in kitchens, it honestly looked like they just bought them frozen, and were lugging them into the kitchen to be fried (it looked like the bag was sealed). And based on my experience eating them, that seems to hold true. Really disappointing.   The side Sauerkraut I ordered was also terribly underwhelming. Extremely bland, it didn't seem like it had been fermented enough. At least they were trying to make it in-house.   Insult to injury - Rose and Sons was never a \"cheap\" place to go to, but it was good value for high quality, unique offerings. Now, in addition to being overpriced, they are also just taking senseless short cuts. With your $17 Reuben (remember, JUST the sandwich, no sides at all), you receive a quarter of a pickle (so, I guess that IS your side). If you want more, you have to pay $1.50. Seriously? Half a pickle, or, gasp, a full one, would have been too much?   This place used to be such a cool place - awesome milkshakes (hello bourbon caramel milkshake), neat drink offerings (including having the staff pick out a flight of three bourbon tastings for you), good desserts, awesome meal options (fried chicken meals, including nashville hot?!), sides (amazing smoked tomato soup, daily specials, and awesome breakfasts (fried chicken and grits!).  It looks like most of this has gone away. Yeah, you can buy New York Seltzer pop with your meal now. Great - not like it isn't available across the street at Food Depot.   Basically, Rose and Sons has gone from a place that had a really cool and unique menu and atmosphere - a real RESTAURANT - that you could recommend to serious foodies and normal eaters alike, to a slightly above average mundane deli that is terribly overpriced. It used to be a gem, a happy surprise marked by a ridiculous FOOD sign outside. Now? Better off just go to New Yorker Deli.   Damn sad - I really hope this place makes some big changes. The old iteration was pretty special.   Avoid."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times......now,  depending on how you feel about brunch- personally i think its over rated and if you have to wait in line 45 minutes just to sit down.... I just can't handle that. Needless to say I went during the week and it wasn't busy - the food is OK- everything is over salted and over sugared. The place itself is small and crammed. I get the kitschy restaurant diner vibe but I just don't care for it. Of all the Anthony Rose restaurants, Big Crow and Bar Begonia are the better ones of the bunch."}
{"text":"I found this place quite fun and lovely. I think their smoked turkey sandwich is definitely worth trying. I wasn't particularly impressed by their BBQ chicken but still I think it was a good dish."}
{"text":"everything. EVERYTHING. Was so good.  We failed to think ahead and make reservations on a Saturday at 1pm so ended up waiting insanely long (1.5 hrs) for a table for 5 in this small maybe 30-seater joint. We were hooked as we watched thru the kitchen windows and saw a few dishes being made, then got too hungry to try and find somewhere else to eat, then ended up seeing legit every single item on the menu be made.   Pretty much ordered everything on the menu:  HUEVOS RANCHEROS - The flavour of the green chorizo sausage patty was great, combined with crispy tostada, a sunny side up egg, salsa, and guacamole  RICOTTA PANCAKES WITH SOUR CHERRY COMPOTE - fluffy with well balanced sour cherry compote and a dollop of ricotta. Not bad execution but very re-createable as it was just these three items on the plate  FRIED CHICKEN AND GRITS - the fried chicken portion looked really small as we were watching the dish be prepared but the dish overall was a proper portion size (i.e. perhaps a bit smaller than you are used to for restaurant brunch portions). Texture contrast was so on point, fried chicken was crunchy crisp without being thick. Grits delicious. Topped with a sunny side up egg.  BEEF BRISKET AND CORNBREAD - all star winner of the meal, the wedge of cornbread is fried on a flat top to a crisp and topped with the most melty beef brisket imaginable, drizzled with a tangy sauce and honey. Topped with a sunny side up egg. Unreal!  CREAM CHEESE STUFFED FRENCH TOAST - two thick Texas cut toasts with cream cheese stuffed inbetween and given the French toast treatment. Doused with seasonal fruit sauce, a peanut crumble, and honey. Delicious but unless you have a sweet tooth or are splitting another dish, it'd be hard to have in one sitting all to yourself. Large portion.  And once we demolished that, topped off with a special of the day:  HARVEST VEGETABLES WITH CORNED BEEF - roasted medley of squash, brussel sprouts, tomato, sitting on the most unctuous squash puree. Topped with a sunny side up egg. We opted to add corned beef which was the best decision: fried large cubes of corned beef that so was melty and made me enjoy corned beef for the first time.  So, yes. Go. Book in advance, order everything, and take your cholesterol meds for the spike in egg and melty meat consumption."}
{"text":"My favourite spot in the neighbourhood. Patty melt, fried chicken, mac n cheese, pork belly fried rice, corn bread, brownie surprise. Great cocktails, great coffee, great night staff."}
{"text":"I ate here once. Thought it was overpriced, excessively oily, high quality diner food. I left feeling unhealthy and poorer. Unlikely to return to this establishment, but don't worry - Anthony Rose can still capture my business at Fat Pasha, which I like a lot."}
{"text":"This is such a gem to find, the diner is very small, cozy and intimate. You immediately feel ready for a great breakfast as soon as you walk in. The coffee is great, and the staff are absolutely wonderful. Our server recommended the special but we went for the Fried Chicken and grits instead. Beautifully presented and just the right amount of food. Didn't feel rushed out despite the people waiting for tables. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Great spot. Cozy.  Sort of feels like a secret you have to know about as it is not visible from street and is down a short alley.  Went with a group and we shared a number of meals which is the way to do things here. Chicken was very good, miami style ribs are also recommended. The rabbit was surprisingly tender.  The sausage was very good also.  We also tried the ribs but by then we were getting full even though we were there with a group.  Each dish had very interesting spices and toppings that gave it interesting flavours but did not overpower or change what you were ordering.  We did not like the dessert that much.  I think they need to expand dessert to offer one or two other options.  Overall, it is absolutely worth the try but it is not cheap.  So be prepared for that."}
{"text":"Good food but rude service. Try but go with patience and a happy face so that rudeness doesn't interfere with ur meal."}
{"text":"Quick update. Dinner was really good, but our brunch this weekend... brunch was FIVE STAR FANTASTIC.  There WAS a one hour wait, so have a snack before you go, but the meal was well worth it. I highly recommend the biscuits, and the cornbread, and whatever they choose to pile on top of both.  My only suggestion? Skip the hash, and just go straight to a big plate of french fries. YUM!  $26 inc. tax and tip for a breakfast, juice, and 1/2 the hash."}
{"text":"Came here on a long weekend, place seemed a little understaffed but they were nice and food came out fairly quick for a place that was understaffed.   The bacon and sausages are amazing here!   The hashbrowns were also amazing - with sautéed onions. Great flavour.   The only downfall is the bread. A little over toasted and hard to cut/chew thru.   I'd love to come back on a regular weekend to see their weekend brunch menu."}
{"text":"Had dinner at Rose & Sons on a Saturday night at 9 pm. My boyfriend & I made reservations and when we arrived there was a table waiting for us. Rose & Sons is tiny and a bit loud: the noise coming mostly from the patrons, yakking away.  We had two appetizers:  1) Grilled ceasar salad with anchovy dressing & squash. Delicious dressing, but I personally am not a fan of grilled lettuce. While I enjoyed it, this was the only dish of the night I can't absolutely rave about.  2) Special of the night: Buttermilk batter, deep fried cornish hen wings in a spicy-sweet sauce, with a side of sweet & pickled cucumber. Delish! Spicy enough to have a kick without being too hot. One of the highlights of the meal.  Doug had the grilled skirt steak with french fries. His eyebrow raised a bit when it came sliced (I don't know is that a thing?). But he really enjoyed it - he even liked the subtle bernaise sauce that came with it and he usually doesn't like it when people put sauces on steak. The french fries were good too.  I had the porterhouse pork chop with chili greens, hush puppies and maple syrup. Very nice. The pork chop was amazing and the maple syrup was not too sweet. But the real winner of this dish was the hush puppies. Really yum. I don't think I've ever had hush puppies before, but they were awesome and really complemented the dish.  I could only eat one out of the two chops on my plate and still have room for dessert so I got the 2nd one for takeaway.  For dessert we ordered the \"Brownie Surprise\", which our server would only say was \"chocolate and had peanuts\" - and the rest she couldn't tell us because it was a surprise. When it came I sure was surprised over how much I LOVED it, and I expected to enjoy it a whole lot.  It was a slice of chocolate brownie with peanut butter sauce, chocolate sauce, whole peanuts and a BIG dollop of soft-serve vanilla ice cream. WOW. Heaven. This is the most expensive dessert they had ($14) and it's very sharable and very worth the $$$.  The meal, plus three alcoholic drinks ran us around $130 plus tip.   Will return. Next time we go I want to try the \"schmaltz mash\". The people around us seemed to be ordering the $50 \"family dinner\" and it looked pretty smashing too.  Worth noting: when we left at 10:15 there was a line up out the door."}
{"text":"Big Crow is a very cool spot. It really reminded me of being at camp as a kid... but the food is waaaay better. The atmosphere is awesome, cute little details really made the experience way better, like the Hudson Bay striped water jugs. The menu has a variety of meats and were cooked in the back with a wood burning bbq. The smell is amazing. The drinks menu looked great, sadly I forgot my ID and was refused to be served but the waiter was very apologetic about it.  I highly recommend the bacon and the tzatziki ribs(?). The dessert, smore sandwich was yummy but hard to eat.  Overall, great experience. Staff was polite, food yummy and great campy feel."}
{"text":"So apparently I lived next to the Dupont location this whole time (and by this whole time, I mean the past 6 months) and didn't even realize it because the most noticeable sign says FOOD. BUUUUUT, when I found out the restaurant was Rose and Sons, I knew I had to try out their brunch because they are ranked #10 in blogTO's BEST BRUNCH IN TORONTO article in October 2016.   Overall, the meal was okay. The service was not the greatest. I came here on a Sunday with my BF around 1:50 for brunch and I was surprised we didn't have to wait for a table at all. Since I live a 30 second walk from the restaurant, I usually see people waiting outside for a seat and what not, but it was quite empty when we got in (I think it was because we came here on the first day of Daylight Saving and everyone was still asleep).   I ordered a latte and their fried chicken and grits. My BF ordered the huevos rancheros and fries on the side. We waited around 20 minutes for the food to come, and I never got my drink until I prompted the servers. I wish I got my drink a bit earlier because it would have gave me something to do while I waited. (Plus, I REALLY wanted to drink my latte). The food was alright. I think this place is just quite overpriced in general. These four items costed 50 dollars, PRE-TIP.   If I waited 30 minutes for a table and an extra 20 minutes for the food, I think I would have been unimpressed in general. I would probably not come again just because we lucked out on the waiting for a table part and I don't think the expensive food is worth it.   TLDR; Rose and Sons is a super hipster place with its cool decor and hard ass vibe. The food is quite expensive, but if you really have nothing to do on a weekend and just want to eat some fancy diner foods, then you will definitely enjoy this place."}
{"text":"Went for the soft opening.  It's right behind Rose & Sons, down a little alley way.  It's like going to a friend's house for a backyard BBQ.  Big picnic benches, smoke billowing everywhere - fyi, you're going to smell like you slept in a smoker, so wear washable clothing.  Every now and then, the train passes by and everyone cheers!  Food was really good.  Made for sharing.  Ribs were delicious.  Drink selection was excellent. Service was great.  Don't let the aesthetic fool you; the washrooms were decent!   Overall, a great summer addition.  Will have long line-ups in no time.  Very reasonably priced as well.  Cash or debit only (maybe just for now? Not sure)"}
{"text":"What can I say about  Big Crow that has't already been said so eloquently by Imran of Richmond Hill?   Personally, I feel like I can add nothing.   So I'm going to insist that no matter how many years it may be from the date I wrote this review that you scroll down and find his magnificent review of this awesome restaurant.  Wait, sorry. I can add one thing: This place is totally 5 stars, I can't even begin to fathom why he only gave it 4 stars."}
{"text":"The food was not consistently good but the things that were great were realllly great.  The Versht was very tasty and I enjoyed it immensely.  The rib steak was also really tasty.  The rest of the dishes we ordered we fine but not memorable.  I would definitley take people here but there is better BBQ out there."}
{"text":"Unimpressed and wondering what everyone was raving about! Outside, it's a dirty greasy-spoon that I walked past when looking for it. Inside, there's the grill and bar with stools and a few hardwood booths, seating maybe 20 and ensuring lineups along Dupont's narrow sidewalk. Key thing missing: regular coffee! Only espresso & its various burnt-tasting derivatives. Sad!Hipsters, stop pretending to be classy with your Italianesque beverage! Lunch was okay but over-priced. I won't be going back! Vesta Grill offers better..."}
{"text":"Food was good but if you want the experience, possibly a good time with friends and good service, go somewhere else.  Arrived for lunch to catch up with some friends today. I had called ahead to ask if they could fit a table of 5. They don't take reservations during the day so I was told around 2pm would be good. Got here around 2. Our server was not bad but later another lady, seemingly the manager helped serve our table, and was visibly annoyed by the fact 2 of my friends arrived later even though there were plenty of seats empty.   Then it got a lot worse. One friend heard we were here and dropped by at 3:04 and was told by the manager lady kitchen was closed and no longer offered hot food (we were not told this and were never asked if we'd liked anything else) We shared our food with her, a bit disappointed but were ok. When we asked if we could order dessert, was told a flat out no. The server seemed to be caught in the middle and was trying to be nice, offering us choices of milk shake instead. Feeling the unwelcome gaze of the manager, we asked for the bill. A minute later, our credit card were returned and we were told they only take debit or cash! I am fine with that, but the way they said it was rude. So I commented, maybe you should update your website regarding kitchen closure time and not taking credit.  A few minutes later, as we were paying, the manager shouted over the bar to us :\"for your information, our website does state these info if you read carefully!\" Wow! Just wow! They had no time to offer us dessert but had the time to go on the internet trying to prove me wrong! I don't have to be right, but what a way to make a customer never wanna come back!!  I gave an ok tip to our server cos I felt bad for her trying to remedy the situation and making a few bucks on a Saturday, but frankly, the experience was horrible!  For those like me who prefer good food AND decent service, skip this one. We live in Toronto, there are plenty of choices!  P. S. If you are slightly larger built or pregnant, you may not fit comfortably in the seats. My very slim pregnant friend had to carefully tuck her belly under the table today."}
{"text":"\"Inspired by Algonquin park, canoe trips, cooking over an open fire and swimming in the big lakes of Ontario\"  LOVE the concept. Excellent execution. Great addition to my hood. Disagree with some of the negative comments I'm reading.  *The ribs are great*  -Do you eat ribs for the sauce or the meat?! As much as I love a sticky sweet sauce, I think that if the meat is good quality and cooked well, it shouldn't need so much sauce! Plus, the burst tomato pesto is original and delicious imo  *Staff were warm and friendly*  -Server was helpful and came by just to chat and check up on us a couple of times, owner is a charmer  *Prices are fair*   - E.g. 6 dollars for our 2 scrumptious side salads: potato salad (mushroom, mustard, egg, scallion) grilled corn salad (queso fresco, chili mayo)   Other points:   -Try the smoked mozzarella and roast garlic bread. It may sound boring compared to some of the other starters on the menu but this was recommended by our server and we weren't disappointed. Delicious  -Summer fun atmosphere, great music, pleasing design details  -S'mores ice cream sandwich - not overrated. Fatty Natty approves."}
{"text":"\"DIY BBQ is still better\" - was my unfortunate conclusion, me, a hapless water boiler.   - Service and food came pretty quick, but BBQ was over-cooked, Elvis style.  Charred baby back ribs dried out.  Jerk chicken was also blackened and dry-ish.  Though some flavour managed to survive, but not even enough to trump a $5 marinade at Metro gotta say.  We ordered almost everything off the menu to try.  We tried to instagram it, but it was too blackened #truestory.  In the microcosm that is awesome restaurants in Toronto, people are just going to find better.  Also, some weirdness.  - Maybe it was just the day we came, but upon arriving, we saw the staff being berated rudely and even whapped over the head with menus by the owner.  This domestic situation was awkward to witness and lost of appetite ensued.  Staff slunk away to their stations probably trying to mitigate any further public displays.  I write this in hopes that this gets addressed.  I regret being just a bystander.  - Next, the place was pretty empty around 5pm, but we were told that the reservation list was full, which is totally fine, but in an unnecessarily attitudinal way, if that's a term.  But when said list of people did not materialize in the next half hour, we were back.  We are not normally so masochistic, just in the middle of nowhere, hungry.  So, there is def some line-up posteuring going on.  - There is one toilet for both restaurants.  - Service during eating was great--happily incongruous with the other things.  Maybe staff should find a better place to work.  Conclusion: Better to break your building rules with a DIY BBQ than trek up to mid-town nowhere and maybe (not) get a seat.  Save yourself from the light dusting of carcinogens and the echoes of Archie Bunker."}
{"text":"The place is cool. It has a fun, energetic vibe to it, but it's very small. I understand trying to use every available space but the tables are super close to each other. We ended up sitting at the communal table, which means we were very close to our neighbours.   The place was very busy. They don't take reservations on the weekend, so if you need a table get there early; especially if you have a big group you might have to wait a bit longer.   Service in the beginning was good until the waitress forgot about my tea. Our waitress also did forget about us for awhile. I didn't mind because we weren't in a hurry. But if we were the service was a bit slow. The good thing was our food came out promptly.   I had the bread pudding with blue berries and bacon, which was delicious. The bread had a nice texture to it, not too soft. The crispy bacon was a nice counter balance to the sweetness of the pudding.   My friend had the cheddar burger with fries. It was good the patty was flavourful and juicy, and who doesn't love melted cheese. The texture of the bread was toasted and crispy.   I saw people trying out the pulled pork on corn bread, which will be my next order."}
{"text":"BRUNCH.  A Saturday at noon and I'm speed-walking because there is no one spilling out the door just yet.  I beat the crowd!  My wait is only 20 minutes and my friend is en route so it is all good.  Rose and Sons is pretty tiny and there is an abundance of communal seating in the middle...or what could be for a party of 8....but during brunch, 4 parties of 2 will do.  This place is expensive.  $35.00 a person expensive.  I had the 3 egg all day breakfast with a lime rickey.  The drink was good.  The hash is to die for.  The bacon was almost like a hybrid between bacon and sausage, it was so juicy and thick.  The eggs were good.  The toast was Texas cut.    Overall, a very cool and vintage diner vibe.  It is really tiny and I totally hated being sandwiched between so many hungover people recovering from Friday night.  But it definitely is a must-try."}
{"text":"Overflowing with hipster vibe yet unpretentious. We came early on a weeknight and the place had not started to pick up, but I can see how it could become pretty crowded when at all busy. Fun atmosphere with the little open kitchen and attentive service. The meal was absolutely delicious and though it seemed pricey was well worth it. Will definitely return and try more items."}
{"text":"Creative and fun. Just a mouth full of taste. Would highly recommend. The price point seemed a bit high at first but it was worth every dollar. Every bite was satisfying."}
{"text":"Everything on the outside makes it look like a burger joint. Ironically, they don't have any burgers. Selection of food is limited, overall quality is ok. Price is high though. For the Patty Melt it end up being $19.21 with tax for a patty on rye bread with French fries!"}
{"text":"Honestly, not that impressive. It's also very hipster-y, yet has insane line ups on weekends. I guess other people like it?  I struggled to find something to order when we came here for brunch, so I got the french toast. There was very little selection, and I didn't want any bacon or anything. The food was okay, but the portions were huge and I felt really fat by the time I was done. I needed help finishing it. I immediately went into a food coma.   I would recommend this place as a hangover-brunch place, but nothing more."}
{"text":"This place has an amazing atmosphere.  Great vibe and great tables.  The drink menu is small - but when we went they were out of 3 beverages.  They don't have a full bar and can't do cesars (which is disappointing because the Rose and Sons does a mean cesar).    We were a party of three and shared a bunch of things.  The food was a little under cooked and the shared salad type things all sort of tasted the same.  The bacon dish was delish - overall it was a nice spot.  The food did leave a little to be desired."}
{"text":"4.5 stars  To all the haters... please do realize that this restaurant is only 3 weeks old.  There are always lots of kinks to be worked out in that time.  I came here on a Wednesday night with a reservation.  At the door, I was greeted by Anthony Rose, the owner of the restaurant who was formerly at the Drake Hotel.  The place is a casual, neighbourhood eatery that serves up really solid food.  The place itself is not that big, and there is a good chance you're going to have to share a table as they have many large communal tables in proportion to smaller ones.  We were unfortunate and ended up being first seated behind a young family, with the kid causing small earthquakes everytime he jumped up and down.  When asked for another table, we were initially refused, but Anthony quickly made a table available.  For those of you expecting to be pampered, this is not your joint.  In fact, you write down your own order reminiscent of a pho restaurant minus the numbered menu items.  You simply write out the dish you want, with only the word that's bolded in the description of the dish.  Menus are printed daily and change frequently (though not everyday).  We opted to try the cocktails, though I think next time I will stick with wine, or one of their sodas.  It wasn't that the cocktails were bad, they just weren't anything memorable.  We started with the Grilled ROMAINE with Toscano (my favourite cheese from Monforte Dairy), anchovies and garlic.  This was a warm salad and probably one of the best salads I've had in recent memory.  I'd order it again in a heartbeat.  We also shared the SCHMALTZ which is a latka with wasabi tobiko (salmon roe), sour cream and chives.  Crispy, crunch (from the tobiko) and delicious.  The smoked trout was delicious albeit scant.  The main attraction here is the PATTY MELT.  It is SO good to see pink in my burger.  It's the way a burger ought to be served.  A juicy patty is wedged between fried onions and melted cheese with a side of french fries and chili mayo.  My tasting experiment result was that the fries tasted better with plain old ketchup.  This patty was reminiscent of a Behemoth Burger (a burger wedge in between a grilled cheese).  It was delicious and you should probably share this beast of a sandwich or you'll be waddling out.  For dessert we opted for the Soft Serve Vanilla Custard with Peanuts, Caramel and Candy Cane... Candy Cane?  Really?  Those were my thoughts exactly, but when this cup of heaven showed up in front of me, my skepticism quickly vanished.  The candy cane actually worked really well in this dessert!  While the food was solid, I do agree that the service could use some fine-tuning.  Our main (the PATTY MELT) showed up as the same time as our appetizers, which meant that by the time we got to it, it got a bit cold.  The server did apologize that things came out all at once, but that was all we got - an apology.  The drinks (as in cocktails) as I mentioned were nothing to Yelp about.  Kudos that they are fully licensed even during their soft opening and that they accept plastic (e.g. credit card) and are not cash only.    I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We go for brunch here during the week & love it. We love the food and we love the waitress. It can get crowded quick so we go a bit early. Yes, it's more expensive than a greasy spoon restaurant, but average for a Toronto brunch. Yes, there are a few hipsters about but as long as you don't feed or poke them they keep to themselves."}
{"text":"Cozy place and easy going staff! Really enjoy the ambiance as well as the food which i found delicious and out of the ordinary breakfast."}
{"text":"love the atmosphere Staff were great  food was good would definitely go back the only thing i didn't love were the Ribs they were cooked perfectly but could have used a BBQ sauce of some sort (the one on the bacon would have been perfect)"}
{"text":"I don't really get the hype surrounding this place. I wanted to like my experience here. It has a great vibe and looks so promising that I was expecting a wowing culinary experience. Unfortunately, it really didn't live up to the hype.   I had the chili and garlic broccoli. For starters, I didn't know WHAT I'd be getting. Is it going to be a chili with garlic and broccoli? Would it be chili with garlic flavoured broccoli? Or would it just be broccoli with chili and garlic seasoning?   Turns out it was just a plate of broccoli with a whole lot of garlic and barely any chili flavouring. It was drenched in oil and was just so limp that I almost felt bad for the poor broccoli. It's hard to do broccoli wrong, but this place sure did. I could have poured the grease off my plate and into a cup after eating the broccoli. Weird.  I then tried the tomatoes - charred onion and avocado salsa, pimento toast. This was a bit better but the pimento toast was also greased up. There was too much pimento cheese on the toast that it just sort of overpowered everything. The tomatos were good but again soaking in too much oil.   Overall, I was fairly disappointed with the food at Rose & Sons. I'm confused as to why it's getting so much buzz."}
{"text":"Toronto's summer dream is a good patio with shade (preferably provided by nature's trees), ample seating and good refreshing drinks. Let me add to my last statement, several drinks... just to be realistic.   Rose and Sons Big Crow is the vibe I look for when the sun is out, the heat is on, and the tummy is rumblin'. It's all taken care of here and I'm sure you've already heard a few things about this place (S'more ice cream sandwich ring a bell?). It's all that but it comes at a price, and without reservation, a long wait too.  The Big Crow is a Backyard restaurant that serves old fashioned grilled meats, picnic sides and homey desserts. It's the sort of place that reminds me of a suburban BBQ party, down to the picnic style benches, open fire cooking and honest flavors. The walk from front to back is even reminiscent of the narrow alley walk, past-the-backyard-fence experience you get going over to a friend's pool party.   One thing to consider is reserving your spot, because waiting is long and drinking here or next door for 2 hours can get a bit dangerous and pricey. Once seated, the menu reads like a book for 2 year olds. By that I mean it's easy to go through and easy to want everything, to try everything by way of eyes, than mouth and maybe even touch? Drooling comes somewhere between or before, I forgot the exact sequence.  We ordered the JW Bird, Back Ribs, Rabbit, corn salad, pepper and eggplant, and potato salad sides. Split between 3 people, it was a good amount of food. Our favorite were the ribs. The Ribs were damn good, grilled to perfection and topped with this crack-like tomato pesto. We wish we got two orders. The Rabbit tasted like chicken/pork with BBQ sauce. JW bird wasn't special, just a BBQ chicken lacking that crack sauce we wanted and then missed when the chicken came out.  The portions were good, I'd say perfect to split perhaps 2 mains between 2 people and finishing that off with 2 sides and dessert. Sides were good but also nothing to rave about. In case you were wondering, we liked the corn salad most.  To finish this off, of course, that ridiculous S'mores Ice Cream sandwich that everyone in Toronto has probably drooled about. It's exactly what it looks like from picture to person and it tastes good too. I'm not a huge fan of eating bread as dessert, so it wasn't that exciting for me, but it was better than I thought and it made for good pictures (in case anyone wanted a fourth look).  Overall, I really liked Big Crow for it's great backyard BBQ vibe, for it's open BBQ fire and for it's honest flavors which can only be created by charring meat over open flame. However, I did find it pricey (around $40 bucks each for what we ordered between 3 people) and although the flavors were good, nothing stood out to be amazing and noteworthy besides the ribs. So get the ribs, those are worth the trip."}
{"text":"Creative menu with fresh food and flavors but the dishes can get a bit heavy with fried components and mayo sauce. With its relatively high prices, this is a special occasion kind of place that is quirky, fun, and innovative."}
{"text":"I loved the atmosphere although it totally did feel a bit hipster-ish. The food was not what i expected or enjoyed however. I ordered a fried rice dish with pork in it and it was actually burnt!! It was hard to beleive that they still served the dish when it was so very obviously overcooked. The chicken club was ok...a bit awkward to eat and just didnt pack the punch I was looking for. Enjoyed the craft beers on tap and found the service to be good but wont be back for dinner. At the end of our meal, the waitress told us about the Big Crow BBQ in the back and I had wished she told us this upfront so we could have missed out on this meal altogether! Next time!"}
{"text":"I was excited to go here but probably would not go back for brunch. I just found it hard to enjoy because there were so many fruit flys flying around and our waitress was not on top of her game. It's quite expensive and a bit rough around the edges."}
{"text":"I haven't even eaten yet and I love it. Whitesnake followed by Sabbath on the spin and it's only 11:20 am."}
{"text":"Have been here a few times and enjoy it. Went by today and had the PLB sandwich. Sounds kind of weird with the sour cherries, but it most definitely works. Classic breakfast is also good; the potato hash is amazing.   Great music in here at all times.   They don't have drip coffee, which I'd prefer, but the coffee they make is good.   Seating is a bit different with shared benches. I don't mind it at all, but often times you have to get out of your seat to allow other patrons in and out, or to allow staff to clean up after guests. Can be a bit of a hassle.   Fan if this spot"}
{"text":"Missed my flight at Billy bishop and was driving though the neighbourhood looking for a place for breakfast and found this place on yelp.    First impressions were not good, looked like a too small greasy spoon but after sitting down and ordering a coffee I looked around and it was very clean.  The coffee was excellent and the breakfast sandwich was delicious.     If I'm ever in the area for dinner I will try out the other place in the same building. Big Crow"}
{"text":"Very delicious but paying nearly $20 for a bowl of fried rice is expensive definitely just going ot recreate it at home :)...delicious nonetheless and unique flavours.   They have multiple locations and at another I had their pork belly. Expensive as well but tasty, the skin was like a chicharon chip and then you can inhale the mean/fat it was crazy. But I just recall after giving it two chances I left still hungry and my wallet emptier leaving me dissatisfied. It'll take some convincing to go back again solely due to the prices."}
{"text":"Pastrami sandwich is hands down one of the best. Great portion and flavor. Meat was juicy and cut fresh to order.  Patty melt is a bit too greasy for me, but the grilled cheese with patty combo works. Fries are okay  Will definitely be back for their pastrami. Keep up the nice deli work!"}
{"text":"The food was OK for the price. I had the shrimp and grits, which was OK. I was expecting a few more shrimp. The table next to us had a big bucket of what appeared to be wings, which looked amazing. Afterwards, we took a walk up to Casa Loma and explored the outside gardens."}
{"text":"After reading a review in Post City Magazine that Rose and Sons was the best deli in Toronto, I had to find out for myself. I had pictured a mid size trendy restaurant on Dupont with a line up to get in.   When I saw the place my friends and I looked at each other and thought maybe this was a mistake. But since we drove down from Thornhill and North York we decided to give it a try. The place is old - when I say old, I mean really really old! It's in the old People's Restaurant. The kitchen and bathroom were really awful and the restaurant itself had 4 old booth style seats. We were the only ones there at 6:30 on a Saturday evening for dinner.   We ordered the chicken matzo ball soup which arrived luke warm. The matzo ball was bland but the soup tasted like home made chicken soup.  Then came the pastrami knish which was like no knish I'd ever eaten. It was a deep fried crunchy wonton shell with a mush filling of (I think) pastrami and potato? I'm not sure. Very odd knish. Then the meals came. We ordered pastrami sandwiches which came with a piece of an old dill and fries on the side which we paid extra for. The pastrami was delicious. Would I say it's the best pastrami I have eaten. No. Centre Street Deli and Pancers win out over Rose and Sons. I would give it 3rd place though. Fries were nothing special. I wanted to add salt but the salt was as old as the restaurant and was stuck in the shaker. I banged it on the wooden table to loosen it up, but nothing was going to budge it. The one thing I did not appreciate was that the mustard came already on the sandwich. I don't care for regular mustard, I prefer a bold and spicy, slightly sweeter mustard which they had, but the mustard was already on the bread?   The service was great, the waitress was attentive and answered all our questions with a smile. I think she could tell we were not thrilled with the ambiance. The bill was average for a deli meal.  I'm going to stick to my uptown delis for now on. Centre Street, Pancers, Yitz's, Wolfies all much better than this deli. The person who reviewed it must never have had a Jewish bubbie cook for him/her."}
{"text":"Been twice so this is a review based on the combined impression both for brunch. Coffee's excellent if a bit pricey (there's no drip option, which means better quality but if you are a serious coffee gulper that can add up) cocktails not bad at all, had the going to grandma's egg white earl grey based thing nice balance of sweet and sour. Beer limited taps (2) small collection of tall boys. Mains, had the bread pudding plus bacon, loved the bacon, liked the pudding it was good but heavy which isn't all bad but it was very all the same bites for the whole plate. Needs something that gives it a chewy or crunchy bit. My friend had the all day breakfast, good potatoes ok egg, sausage was ample but a bit unusual in its spices without that being a good thing. Toast order wasn't quite right either. Special the second time was a korean pancake dish with the exellent bacon, kimchi, maple hosin sauce and a fried egg. Totally worth it compared to the other two dishes.  Service is a bit spotty, however they are quite busy so it's hard to be sure if it's because they are busy or so busy chatting with each other. Overall I'd go back because it's a cute spot with the bacon to die for, however for the price I'd love to see the service come up a little notch. Points for putting in place a texting waiting system."}
{"text":"Decent breakfast.  This place was within walking distance of our Airbnb which was a plus but it was pretty tiny so we ended up sitting at the bar.  Most of the tables are shared so think about that if you're just two and you get seated at a huge table - you'll definitely have company later.    The breakfast menu is pretty tiny.  I ordered eggs, bacon, hash, toast, jam (standard fare) and was really disappointed that my bacon was floppy af.  Honestly, who likes bacon that floppy?  It was bizarre and disappointing.  The homemade sour cherry jam made up for that though and I enjoyed it on my English muffin.  The coffee was strong and the service was pretty good.  Since we were at the bar it wasn't too hard to get someone's attention if we needed something.  The seating was cramped though so that kind of put a damper on totally enjoying our meal.  My husband enjoyed his grilled cheese and tomato soup and would get it again if it were an option.   All in all, an OK place for breakfast.  I wouldn't say Rose and Sons is doing anything vastly different than a lot of other hipster breakfast spots but their food was pretty good and it seemed to be a staple within walking distance of many people in this particular neighborhood. A lot of people left on foot with strollers and stuff so it's always a plus to have a place you can walk to.  Prices were a bit high and, again, eggs and bacon aren't really that special so watch your wallet when you come."}
{"text":"Big Crow: Big Disappointment! Wanted to try the front restaurant, but it was packed on a Wednesday night. Big mistake. Maybe in the heat of summer, in the daylight this place would work. At this time of year, dim bulbs and patio heaters doesn't give the best impression of Algonquin Park. Take a canoe paddle and hit the owner over the head: menus with tiny print in darkness. I am sure JW Bird means something to somebody, but what is it for us newbies? I am sure the passle of U. of T. students had a great time, a table of 4 women nursed glasses of water for the entire time we were there, but that's no reason to charge me 3 bucks for a tiny bottle of Coke that wouldn't fill a Barbie Doll. Potato salad tasted like it had been in the prepared trough at Loblaws waay too long, nothing resembling what the website details. The ribs, oh the ribs, dry/overcooked, stone cold from the squashed cherry tomatoes and assorted gunk on top. I get the whole lets go camping vibe, lets eat off cheap plastic plates, sit on wooden benches, but don't you dare charge me for fine dining prices. Mr. Thuet outta prevent them from buying his bread, to use as a mop for the dry ribs, and advertising his name to pump up there menu.  Thank god for left over tirkey at home!"}
{"text":"My original review was very early on (see below). Since then I have watched rose and sons grow in to a more authentic and awesome spot. Love my meals and have discovered their cocktails. So glad they lost some of their edge and refocused on the food. Worth a visit and I recommend a late lunch to avoid the longer brunch lines.   Original review:  So. We were happy to see a new brunch spot after the sadness of loosing Peoples. But boy this place is not hitting the mark yet!  I am hopeful it will find its legs and become a great local spot for us.     Let's see. 12 staff. Totally disorganized and crowding up the space. Smoky. The guy working the door is pushy - totally unnecessary.  The menu is missing some basic explanations 'extra thick' bacon would be nice so folks don't pay for a side they don't want.   We had the 3 eggs - blah & over priced, the ancho braised eggs - yummy, but slightly misleading on the menu, more like a bowl of chilly with a poached egg...a 60$ brunch - felt mugged and could tell others at our squashed communal table were also feeling ripped off!  I am ok with their gimmicky 'write your own order thing' but can imaging it will annoy others - they are definitely trying hard to be cool - you can get the vibe of 'trying a bit too hard to look like we haven't tried' from the street with the old sign, the mustache on the menu, the scruffy looking staff, the gin cesars...anything hipster is infused in to the tiny spot,  totally feels try hard.  Based on the long lines, it is working so far.  They will trade on a younger UofT / Annex crowd, but at that price point, they may see crowds dwindle once the newness wares off.  What was good: latte was excellent, as was the vodka Cesar. Like that they use Montreal bagels.  What needs work: service is slow and scattered. 10 mins for a coffee at brunch?! The 3 eggs were overpriced with too runny eggs and the 'sausage' was more like a Peperoni stick - tasted pretty good, but not like breakfast, floors were super slippery, prices should be revisited, menu description are vague at best, they need to ditch 5 staff and replace with one seasoned waitress who knows how to work a brunch crowd...it would be ok if she wasn't part of their hipster crew...people just want you to bring their coffee quickly.    I recommend you let the dust settle before checking this place out - hopefully they will tweak their model a bit and grow in to a great brunch destination...but for now its not worth your moola!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner tonight at this location. The restaurant only opens at 5:00 p.m., but we arrived at about 4:50 and waited outside till someone let us in closer to opening time.  I fully understand that they only open at 5, but there is a cold weather warning out and several people just looked at us and walked away.  We got ourselves seated and ordered our meals.  After we had ordered another table had come in.  The server at that time informed them of the special, which we over heard, but at no point in time did she let us know about it.  Would have been nice to have another option.  I ordered the Special Fried Rice. The rice wasn't cooked at all.  It wasn't just crunchy from being fried, it had a distinct raw taste.    Our server never came by to check on us, even thought there was only 1 other  table in the restaurant.  She came by to clear our table and asked me if I was still working on my dish, I advised her the rice wasn't cooked.  She removed the plate and took it to the cook, who very loudly tried to defend that the dish was fine.  So loudly that anyone in the restaurant at that time could hear him.    The waitress removed the item from our bill and once again you could hear the cook going on and on about how it was cooked.  Even the waitress at the time of payment tried to convince me that it was crunchy because it was fried.  It is really disappointing because I had high hopes to come back and I  understand that mishaps happen in the kitchen, but to have the staff on top of that try to convince me I was wrong was really disappointing.  I will not be returning or recommending to this restaurant and that decision is purely based on service and attitude."}
{"text":"PROS : Wow wow wow . We started with the crispy friend rice. It was a big hit and everyone at the table thought it was the best dish of the night. We also tried the cornbread it was a very generous serving and delicious. I had the perch tacos which were to die for, kinda spicy but a good match to the deep fried fish. My friend tried a special menu item which featured octopus but it was covered in sauce and overwhelming..it looked gross (but its not on the menu). Also we had the steak frites. What a delicious experience.   CONS: This place has four tables. It is so unbelievably tiny and the kitchen is exposed making it very warm. This place is crazy expensive. Hold on to your coat...they hang them on the wall by the washrooms where anyone can access your coat or whats in it."}
{"text":"The vibe: Went here for lunch on a Thursday. Wasn't overly packed. A diner vibe with some shared tables and an open kitchen at the front. Service was reasonable though there were some minor mix-ups with what I ordered. Overall though, a pleasant vibe.   The drinks: Some nice craftier beers in bottles. I had the Howe Sound, which I enjoyed.  The food: Ordered the famous Fried Chicken club. Came with a side of fries. The combination of perfectly cooked and seasoned fried chicken with slaw and pickles on some nicely buttered bread was solid. There was a spicy seasoned ketchup that came with the plate but honestly, I'd probably prefer Heinz.   My overall impression: A great sandwich and a cool vibe. Rose & Sons seems like a nice spot to go to when in The Annex."}
{"text":"Service is good. Food is great! Venue is a very great diner like. We walk in the door and the place looks awesome. It was smaller than I expected, but had a great diner vibe.  We sit down in this long bench next to other people, but the bench was big enough that it never feels like we were sitting next to them, we were just \"next\" to them.  The waitress, she explained all the dishes like they were her personal favorites which is awesome. And everything just sounded so tasty.  I had the Duck Confit Hash that has a salad with like fruit and nuts in it. And one egg on top cooked medium well. The duck leg was big  and the hash also cooked in the duck fat. Delicious!  So why the minus one star, no credit card? Really?  Anyways, I'd come here again in a heart beat to eat more. Perhaps for dinner! Keep it up Anthony Rose!"}
{"text":"Ever wonder if Anthony Rose is gunning to colonize Dupont Street? The young big-shot hip restauranteur has already established a handful of joints on the rather dead and industrial road (and another one on the way, oy vey!), appealing to the various culinary inhibitions and trend-conscious tastes of the city's zombie hoards of hipsters and yuppies. And it all started with this Rose and Sons outlet after he left an exec chef job at the Drake. With such a pioneer independent gentrifying mentality, you'd better get your dibs in trying the foods before developers succeed in their evil plans of turning all the nearby industrial land into condos! But hey, Dupont station, the Tarragon Theatre, George Brown College and Casa Loma are all nearby, and the affluence of the Annex further south reeks barely, so...  Rose and Sons took over a greasy spoon burger joint on the street, signs of which are vaguely left behind like a stereotypical trophy prize. It aims to project a hole-in-a-wall greasy spoon diner atmosphere, which doesn't that effective given how much the place oozes of flashy shameless ironic hipsterness, and how friggin' tiny it is (very crammed and feels like an overcrowded bus; I'd say you can squeeze 25-30 people in here max). Most of the cooking takes place in a very tiny open kitchen. A mirror wall at the back gives the illusion of bigger space, shattering every time the bright headlights of a car pulling up on St. George Street reflects off of it.  But to admit, the food here is pretty decent. The pastrami reuben sandwich special was delicious and juicy, and the matzo ball soup was warming, just to give an idea of what dinner is like. Staff are personable and accommodating (I even get to see a new girl get trained in my visit, which was fascinating to me). I think it's a good idea to get dinner reservations to best secure a table (same advice goes for all other Anthony Rose properties, speaking from experience)."}
{"text":"Reviews might be based on the OLD restaurant, they revamped the place, more deli now. 15 is pricey for a Pastrami, but what isn't pricey now..?"}
{"text":"I had chicken sandwich which probably was the best I ever had. The amount was little too much for my stomache, still the taste was really.  Just be ware that outdoor sign does not clearly show the name of restaurant! Keep looking!"}
{"text":"Obviously the food is delicious (schmaltz hash), and the drinks come with sausages on top, but this review will be an ode to our fabulous waiter.  Your lightning tattoo and African print bomber jacket, along with your super awesome personality made our brunch fabulous. Thanks, you stylish betch!"}
{"text":"I saw a review of Rose and Sons in the Globe and thought I should check it out...was not disappointed!   The tiny space is filled with warmth, amazing staff, and even better food. I had the Cheddar and Apple salad (definitely in my top 5 of favourite salads in the city), Lobster french fry salad (so weird, but somehow works), and shared the fudge and hushpuppies with a friend (who had the white fish and loved it) for dessert. I am already planning a return, and would 100% recommend.  Tip: make a reservation to ensure a spot in the limited space, or be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"Wow.  Where do I even begin?  Just came home from dinner.  Am kicking myself for over eating, but that's what happens when the food is THAT good.  Myself and 2 other ladies dined over a bottle of Rose from Niagara that the resto was promoting.  It went well with the liver pate that is on the menu.  When our waitress put \"shmaltz\" all over the liver pate, we asked what the shmaltz was.  Oh, just a little DUCK FAT drizzled EVERYWHERE!  Oy!  It was delicious -- and spread over toasted rye bread -- heaven.  Also ordered the shrimp nachos -- perfectly cooked shrimps, lovely chips and uber-fresh guacamole.  Next up came the corn bread, which was to die for, and the fried chicken, which was really a fried cornish hen cut into 4, blue cheese salad and fried onion rings.  Ended the meal with a cup of tea because we really couldn't stuff another bite inside.  It was all divine.  Fantastic meal.  2 thumbs up.  WAY up."}
{"text":"I've heard great things about this place so my friend and I decided to drop in for brunch.  The decor is simple and very country-like. Wooden tables and booths, it had an old school feel to it too. It can get very cramped during it's peak hours, which is usually around noon. I recommend that you make your way to Roses and Sons around 10AM to avoid the super long line ups for brunch on the weekend. I also recommend that your party size to be about 2-4, any bigger and it'll be uncomfortable and difficult to seat all of you. The bigger the party, the longer the wait, so keep that in mind.   Onto the food, my friend and I decided to each order something different so we can share it and try out two dishes. She ordered the griddled brie cornbread and I ordered their special of the day which was some kind of fish omelette dish. We also craved for something sweet so we ordered the wild blueberry bread pudding as well.  The wild blueberry bread pudding was delicious. It was just sweet enough and the fresh blueberries gave it a hint of that bitter sour taste. Well balanced with each and every bite and the bread pudding was just the right consistency. Soggy and chewy. It soaked up all of that wonderful maple syrupy blueberry goodness. The portion was small,. it only came with one small square piece and I wasn't too happy about it at all.  Griddled brie cornbread with brisket, fried egg, maple syrup and chili sauce. It came with a giant toothy steak knife that was jabbed into the cornbread-brisket. It was very red neck like and raw, I loved the presentation. This dish was rich and heavy but everything on the plate really came together very well. The brisket was cooked perfectly and the cornbread was chewy, soggy and soft like how cornbread should be.  Presentation wise, it looked like a big mess but it was very tasty! The flavours were a bit odd but it worked. The combination of the fish, egg and this bread-like bit was interesting. I'm big fan of weird combinations so this hit the spot for me. Each bite was tangy, zingy and fishy. The bread-like bit helped contrast the mushy texture of the egg and fish by introducing a crunchy texture  Overall, definitely check this place out for brunch one day. Everything's fresh and super tasty!"}
{"text":"Very unimpressed with their customer service.  I made a reservation online ahead of time for the summerlicious event but they had a problem with their online booking system and booked us for their Queen St location which we found out isn't even part of summerlicious  when we got their.   From there we headed to this location on Dupont and explained to them we made our reservations days before and we had just come from their other location. We were very disappointed by the manager as he didn't bother to try accommodate us. The restaurant was not full, there were plenty of available tables and we were not a walk in .... they could have atleast offered us something or apologized for the glitch in their system.  None of us will be coming back that's for sure!"}
{"text":"Came for brunch on a saturday. Very busy already when we arrived just before 10am as there are limited seating. The cornbread with fried chicken was quite good with a bit of sweet and sour flavour, so was the sandwich melt. We noticed the pancakes were very popular and may try that next time. When the food came we thought it looked small but we were actually quite full after."}
{"text":"Went to roses and sons for Saturday brunch. No reservations accepted, but we only waited 2 mins for a table for 4 people. Place is very small and cozy. Hip hop music was playing, which give the place a very urban diner feel. The waiters were very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. The chicken and grits was a small dish. You probably should add a side if you want to be full ($17). What made this dish unique were the grits (i.e. made with duck fat). The duck confit was very moist and filling. All the ingredients complimented well together and looked beautiful on the plate. I was full off this plate - $18. The cornbread brisket was yummy. The mix of sweet and savoury (i.e. brisket and egg) was unique ($15). We added a side of hash browns, which was needed because this dish was also small. We also had coffee and grapefruit juice (not bad). They serve alcohol after 11am. The bill came up to $125 (after tax & tip) for 4 people. CASH OR DEBIT ONLY. A bit pricey for brunch, but the food ingredients were unique enough to warrant an grade of A."}
{"text":"What's a dream menu? Simple: it's the halo-covered menu of your dreams.   In your dreams, dishes have one awesome ingredient topped with another awesome ingredient, topped with cheese, topped with bacon, drizzled with maple syrup and served with fries and gravy and more bacon and more cheese. In your dreams food is carby, it's fatty, it hits all the pleasure zones, and it's delicious six ways from Sunday.  The teeny-tiny, adorable lil diner that is Rose & Sons (formerly People's Food) has a dreamy, dream-like menu that I will henceforth be dreaming about....and they deliver on those high expectations, BIG TIME.  We finally made it here for brunch on Sunday (2:30pm lol) and I ordered a dish that contained the following: expertly made, slightly crispy on the outside yet moist on the inside \"brie cornbread\", covered in maple syrup, topped with a melt-in-your-mouth slice of fatty beef brisket, topped with a fried egg, and drizzled with chili sauce. This dish gave me an all-over body high not unlike a hash brownie (k not really but still)....it was freaking ah may zing. The Punch cocktail, made with white wine, red lillet, seltzer and bits of rhubarb at the bottom was also fantastic.  Always, always follow your dreams :)"}
{"text":"Terrific place for brunch. It's quite a small place, so often you'll have to wait during prime brunch hours. I like the purposeful grunginess of the place as it adds to that diner feel. The caesar's here are absolutely amazing - the best in Toronto, I'd say. Their Griddled Brie Cornbread is probably my favourite, very heavy, but super tasty. This is a must try if you're an avid bruncher. Make sure to also visit their sister restaurant, Big Crow, just behind. You can also park at the nearby LCBO for free parking."}
{"text":"Amazing food! They put a delicious twist on diner classics that will amaze you... My only complaint is they don't have many healthy options, but I guess that goes with the diner theme... Go big or go home."}
{"text":"We went here for an afternoon snack because we heard they had good milkshakes. This place is small, cute, and decidedly hipster. After spending about an hour here, I'm still not sure if it's hipster good or hipster bad. For instance, we were there at a pretty random time of day..., right at 5pm, which was WAAAY before the dinner rush. However, straight away, they asked us if we had reservations. No, we just want a quick milkshake! I get that it's a small place, but there were approximately two people there when we arrived. This felt a bit pretentious.   I get that a lot of smaller places have small menus that they do well, but the milkshake menu was quite small. I'm a fruit milkshake fan, and the only fruit flavour they had on the standard menu was blueberry. They had chocolate, peanut butter, and of course, the cursory salted caramel flavour. I was in luck this particular day, as they had a sour cherry milkshake on special. The sour fruit actually really well with the extremely thick, creamy ice cream. Though I can tell you that the sweet flavours would have become overwhelming pretty fast.   One other point of contention: this was the smallest milkshake I've ever received from a restaurant with a $7 price tag. It is quite flavourful and quite thick, so the small milkshake might be enough. Just be warned... You probably shouldn't go here, at least for dessert, if you don't super thick shakes.   This place looked like it had a nice bar, so maybe we'll come back to try that or dinner. But I can't bank on them having a sour cherry shake again, so I probably won't be getting more milkshakes from this place."}
{"text":"Good stuff. I had the fried cornish hen sandwich (?) which was really nicely done. Flavorful, nicely breaded yet juicy chicken and a brilliant sauce. I was very pleasantly surprised I have to admit. Staff was friendly and experience was great. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Rose and Sons has a \"Toronto cool\" vibe that many in this town value above food, service, or anything. They have the requisite chalkboard with a drawn diagram on it, the old space that seems a bit retro or vintage, a visible cooking area, a well-stocked little bar, and a small seating area with usually uncomfortable seats.  I sat at the bar on a recent visit.The stools are too close to the counter for anyone over 5'5. I am not tall and my knees had no room.  The food is high priced and average. I had a PLB which is a sandwich of bacon, salty sausage, cheese, over easy egg, and a pickle on rye.  It came with a tiny bowl of cooked cherries. The flavours didn't work all that well together, though the cherries were good. The sandwich was 13$ before tax and tip. I am not opposed to a 13$ sandwich, just this one wasn't as special as advertised.  Service is average.  They have other food, as well as a bar. The place was once an old greasy spoon, so you get a bit of that feel. However, with things like 7$ milkshakes, and much higher priced menu items, you could easily have a 50$ lunch here. For maybe a bit less, Fanny Chadwick's is a better option if you need to either impress or eat a higher priced lunch.  Rose and Sons also has a BBQ place out back under a covered outdoor area that is open for weekend brunch and dinner called Big Crow. Some of the reviews here seem to confuse the two."}
{"text":"Had dinner here this past Saturday with wife and friends. All 4 of us felt transported to another space and time. The place has a Greenwich Village New York vibe!!!  The food choices were unique. Comfort food through and through.   We all loved our respective dishes. We also shared with each other including the fish tartar appetizer. WOW!!!  My Coke braised beef brisket was delicious!!!  If you're going to go, make sure you reserve. It's a small joint and will undoubtedly become very popular in no time."}
{"text":"The place is quaint and has a fairly hip feel. Not a lot of seating so you will most likely wait for a table. I liked it. Food was disappointing however. I found it to be in the oily side. I had the fried chicken and grits and my wife had the asada. Both dishes were oily. Aside from the oil, serving also seemed small for the price. I don't think I would come back."}
{"text":"I didn't now about this place for some reason. My friend though, wanted to bring me here for my farewell dinner. We ended up here for dinner one evening (reservations for 2). Ambiance? Preeeetttty hipster. Waiters were fairly hipster, yet really nice. So I guess I can't call them hipster, right? (Well, it's all relative). It's pretty dim in there, and it can get a bit loud. So prepare!  We ordered ourselves the following: 1) FRENCH FRIES & GRAVY: Absolutely relish. Would totally recommend. 2) COCA COLA BRISKET: Dude, this was soooooo good. The twice stuffed baked potato was amazing as well. Brussel sprouts are usually not my thang, but MAN! They were soooo good. I was definitely pregnant with my food baby afterward. ... I can't recall what my friend ordered, but I remember it being delicious as well.  Overall, great experience and great food at Rose and Sons. It's a pretty tiny space, so that's my only problem with it, but otherwise, great place, great ambiance, great service, GREAT FOOD. Can't complain."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I have tried most of their brunch menu and nothing disappoints.  I wish I could go every weekend but then my pants won't fit. Still, I recommend the duck confit and the milkshake 100%!!"}
{"text":"Over-priced, crammed in communal bench tables (no one wants to sit in the middle) and 'tude de hipster for $13 for an appetizer sized, mediocre food.  Washrooms located down a treacherously slippery hallway past 2 or 3 kitchen prep doors.   The bacon was excellent, but not worth $13 for 2 small pieces. 2 eggs and boring toast. To be found at Vesta Lunch for half the price. The sauteed romaine (essentially a deconstructed Caesar salad w less effort and nominal favour except for the anchovies) was um like being the guinea pig in an expensive experiment.   Server was okay, not exactly welcoming (true to hipster form).  Not spending my money here again."}
{"text":"Went in for brunch when it opened.   It was definitely overpriced as usual with these Anthony Rose joints.  However the food was subpar; the anchovy salad was strange and the Caesar was over spiced.  The food was overly greasy.  I enjoy Fat Pasha and Big Crow more."}
{"text":"The place turned into a deli.   The portions are small and very expensive.  The had cut pastrami was average not very seasoned and very fatty.  I didn't like the coleslaw. The potato salad was good.  Won't go back. Not worth the money."}
{"text":"I'd been to Rose and Sons a few times in the past and enjoyed the food, but the recent news that it had been essentially turned into a deli made me curious enough to return.  We arrived at around lunchtime on a weekday and the place was about half full. We quickly took a seat and began perusing the very basic, description-free menu, and I quickly landed on the Reuben.  It arrived a while later and it certainly didn't look like any Reuben I've ever had. One bite confirmed that it didn't taste like a typical Reuben, either. There's no cheese and aside from the meat, the only other topping is an admittedly tasty coleslaw of some kind. It didn't really add much to the sandwich, if I'm being honest.  But I still enjoyed the dish mostly because of the meat inside. Though it was absolutely too lean, the meat contained a smokiness I don't think I've ever tasted in a deli 'wich. It was pretty irresistible and it made me wish I'd ordered just a plain sandwich.  The $17 price point is a little difficult to stomach, though, especially given that the sandwich isn't exactly huge and the only thing it comes with is a quartered pickle.  I also tried a few bites of my dining companion's Potato & Onion Knish. It was pretty dry and tasteless, but I was assured that it improved immeasurably with some mustard on the side."}
{"text":"Don't fall for the hype. This place is over priced, unhealthy, and pretentious. We went this morning and had oily, disgusting granola, undercooked eggs, and bad service. Not worth your time, money, or calories."}
{"text":"Amazing food, quaint spot, great for conversation!! The PLB melt is a must try and the cherries served with it are amazing! Service is great and food is served quickly! Anthony Rose does it again!"}
{"text":"\"It's retarded.\"  That was the answer to the question \"How much food would there be?\"  There were four of us.   We ordered the $50 a person \"Chef's choice\".      Arguably the best price-per-pound-of-goodness in the city.     Everything we ate was delicious.   From the first bite of cornbread to the giant steak bigger than my head to that last slurp of ice cream peanut butter brownie.     An absolutely colossal amount of food.    Enough sodium to kill a small child.  Every single bite delicious.    A super cool atmosphere.  Dotted with hipsters who clearly appreciated the old diner aesthetic in the post-ironic way that only they could.   Bourbon selection galore.   Four Roses, small batch FTW.    Recommended."}
{"text":"Went with my girlfriends for an early bird dinner on Saturday and had the best service and food. Their fried chicken is excellent and their featured drink, dark and stormy, was perfect. All in all a great experience. A must for for any Toronto foodie."}
{"text":"Came here once with friends and enjoyed the experience, servers were nice and accommodating so I decided to host my farewell get together here with a group of friends.   I was looking to make a dinner reservation for 15 people at 7:00pm but then when I called, they said they would be able to take the group at 9:30pm since 7:00pm was already too busy with smaller reservations - understandable. So, I decided to go with that option and if people had dinner already, they could order drinks and dessert here.   Called back to confirm and was told I was taken off the reservation list. When asked if anyone was going to call to confirm this with me sooner the person on the other line (who takes care of reservations) said no one was going to call me to inform me of this, I was lucky to have called, imagine showing up with 15 people and them saying it was cancelled and we had to go elsewhere!  Needless to say, I am extremely disappointed. I can't even believe they practice their business like this. I guess its a place thats good for smaller groups but I don't ever want to come here again knowing this is how they treat their customers."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to trying this place! But I was pretty disappointed. Between the appetizer and 3 meals we ordered, all were just so-so. Not anywhere near the quality I would expect for the prices. Staff was super nice and their specialty cocktail was great. Would only go back for drinks, not food."}
{"text":"You should definitely come here early for brunch if you don't want to wait. My friend and I waited for 20-30 minutes before we got a table for two. Since we got seated in a booth, we got seated in the middle with strangers. This was slightly uncomfortable because when I wanted to get out of my seat, I had to get one of the strangers on my left or right to get out of their seat first.  Now on to the food! I ordered the griddled brie cornbread which came with brisket and fried egg. I personally enjoyed the cornbread more than the brisket. The brisket wasn't dry at all so this is a good dish to order.  My friend ordered friend chicken and soft 'n sexy grits. I don't usually enjoy fried chicken because the inside is usually dry and the only good part is the skin. However, I really liked the fried chicken because the inside was moist. The grits was also really good.  We couldn't help but order the bread pudding with wild blueberries. I didn't like the first bite but as I took several more bites, I really enjoyed it! I definitely recommend getting this if you're craving something sweet to end your meal off."}
{"text":"Before Rose and Sons decided to make its debut, the location was instead a typical old school hasn't-changed-in-forever diner. The owners were ancient and the chef was obviously a son or cousin or nephew, you know that kinda thing. The place served nothing special but you rarely left dissatisfied as you knew what you were going into. They even had Jukeboxes. When it went, I got it... the neighbourhood was moving into more of a `fresh` `live`` and gluten free lifestyle.   I was pumped to go to Rose and Sons. I am no stranger to hipster vibes and it was always packed. Tried to get in a couple times but the wait was too long.   Finally, I went this morning.  SO DISAPOINTED.   The place is still tiny, but instead of keeping the booths simple they have made it so that couples and foursomes have to all sit at the same table along side other couples and foursomes.  Oh and the unlucky middle diners have to ask the people to their right or left (in my experience whatever side we were on) to get out of their seat so they could leave.  Additionally,  My fries were undercooked like nobodies business. Our waiter was as hipster as it gets (the type that makes comments that demand a `clever` trendy response which you don't feel like having to come up with before your coffee and eggs.) Luckily, he was super nice and took the blame and gave us both new breakfasts (the fries were still undercooked.)  And strangely enough, with all the hipster ambition THEY REMOVED THE JUKEBOX MACHINES. WTF?  In the end, I went from have a 50 dollar bill to a 20 and left wishing I had gone elsewhere.  Nonetheless, the grillcheese looked too good. Sometimes you are into suffering for your cheese and bread to be put on a grill, so...."}
{"text":"The food at Rose and Sons is good, but the greasy spoon diner aspect that remains from the previous establishment does it a disservice.  First off, the restaurant is very small and only fits 28 people, and that's squeezing in 8-10 people at a common table. If that's the case it will be tight and uncomfortable. If you want a tip, do yourself a favour and don't go with a group larger than 4 and wait for a booth by the window.  The size of the restaurant is small and so are some of the portions. The blueberry bread pudding, while yummy, was incredibly tiny. Do not consider it a main, but more of an app. The fried chicken and grits is definitely yummy, which I had. Though again its on the smaller side. If you want the most bang for your buck go with the griddled cornbread and brisket.  The server was quite friendly though and accommodating. A pregnant lady was part of our group and had quite a few dietary restrictions and they made it work out.  The food at Rose and Sons is definitely tasty and worth paying for, but the overall experience wasn't ideal. If the place was bigger, and they did diner size portions, I'd be back for sure, but I'll probably just continue my quest at trying out new brunch places elsewhere."}
{"text":"A friend brought me here for an early Sunday brunch. The restaurant is tiny and the line started  piling up by 10:15. Good thing we got there early and nabbed a booth. Don't come here after 10 unless you're willing to do a wait.  Onto the service: it was okay and the waitress checked in on us a few times. The food took a very long time and we saw some people who came in earlier getting their food before us. We tried not to stare at them jealously but I think they noticed (whoops).   The food: I got the ricotta pancakes - one of the few vegetarian options on the menu. The ricotta and sour cherry toppings served no purpose to the dish. They used real maple syrup which was lovely but the pancakes were just a disappointing vehicle for the syrup.   We ordered cappuccinos which came served in water glasses. This meant the glasses were too hot for us to hold and we had to wait for our drinks to cool down which was just so impractical.   The restaurant really commits to it's hipster vibe with the decor, menu and impractical glasses. I wasn't really excited by the food and left wondering why I spent as much as I did."}
{"text":"Kind of disappointed with this one. The cornbread wqs okay but some parts were soaked with syrup and the other parts were too dry. They also overdid it with green onions completely. The coke braised beef was tender but surprisingly tasteless. The shrimp and grits special was very good and the Mac and cheese was okay. The best thing I had was the peanut butter milkshake!  As a side note, this place is tiny inside.  In summary I won't return here and wouldn't recommend it to friends."}
{"text":"$ 34 for a coffee and a salad? Never been there before and will never return. The salad and coffee were ok but you can do way better near by. BTW the option for the tip was set for 18%. You could change it but most restaurants have three options on the screen."}
{"text":"2.5 stars, but just being generous.  I wanted to like this place. I really did. Especially since I suggested we try it and, while I don't entirely feel bad about doing so, the whole party soberly agreed that this was far from the best BBQ in town. I'm not settled on what is the best BBQ in town, but this was certainly not it. In fact, I think I liked Stack (on Yonge, north of Lawrence) better, and Stack is certainly not the best BBQ in town.  It's kind of a trendy, new-fangled BBQ place - for example, they serve lobster, rabbit, miami ribs with tzatziki sauce, short ribs with pesto - but I don't hold that against them. What I hold against them, is that basically every meat we had was tough, chewy and not particularly tasty, save for the chicken wings. For reference, we had the rabbit (comes in hot sauce), miami ribs and half rack of the short ribs.   We did enjoy the sour pickles and our ice cream sandwhiches. The Bohemian Cocktail was probably the best drink we had, but it wasn't anything crazy.  And it didn't feel that cheap."}
{"text":"A total disappointment!  They were on the blogto website as one of the must try Summerlicious restos. We had the option of making reservations online, so my friend booked 5:30pm ( We wanted 4:30pm but it said they were busy)  We drove from Thornhill (45min drive) to the Queen location to where ww thought we booked our Summerlicious reservations. We arrived and asked for the Summerlicious lunch menu only for them to tell us that they do not do Summerlicious at the Queen location and that they only offer it at the Dupont location. The server at the Queen location said our reservations are booked at the Dupont location. My friend and I were kinda bummed and REALLY hungry and was exited to try Rose and Sons food, so we decided to drive to to the Dupont location.  Why would their website give us the option of booked a Summerlicisous lunch reservation at both locations if they only offer it at only one of the locations? How are customers supposed to know these details?  We finally arrive and the server at the Dupont location said we did not have reservations book, so we showed him our booked confirmation on our phone. He apologised and told us that they had 2 big groups coming in shortly and unfortunately there was nothing he could do. We also spoke to the manager who did not accommodate my friend and, but recommended for us to go to other restaurants affiliated with Rose and Sons in the area...HAHAHA are you kidding me? Do you actually think I will go to any other of your restaurants after the poor experience I just had? Good Bye!  We ended up finding Playa Cabana which was a 4min walk way. The food and service was AMAZING and, I'm so glad we ended up going to Playa Cabana instead :)"}
{"text":"Amazing new BBQ joint. Tucked right behind Rose and Sons, look for the big crow on the side of the building. Long picnic benches flanked by reused shipping containers as bars, the outdoor grill and smoker are in a really neat setting.   We ordered half rack of ribs, jerk chicken wings and the lobster. All were simply amazing, filled with flavour. Ribs had a nice crust, but were fall off the bone. Chicken was crispy and had nice heat. Lobster was just amazing. All were accompanied with delicious sauces.   Steam Whistle and a taste of the Kensington Watermelon wheat beer, wife had the Smore ice cream sandwich for dessert."}
{"text":"Rose and Sons has a perfect cozy atmosphere, impeccable service, and amazing food. They were great hosts for a large gathering!"}
{"text":"Take the outdoors, give it a city home. Take Canadian summer, give it a flavour. Take Canadian winter, give it warmth. Take passion, give it fire. Take your parents love, put it in chefs. Take your friends and generously share.   That's what your experience will buy you at Big Crow. A new breed of BBQ restaurants are opening in Toronto. Many inspired by Piccard's Caban A Sucre, many inspired by Canadian childhoods. Whatever it is, the elevated BBQ experience clearly has a place in our Torontonian hearts. Big Crow is the addition to that trend - but Big Crow does something different from Barque or Farmhouse.  It has all the same ingredients, with a big dose of 'welcome into our humble home, have a seat and enjoy the ride'. You just don't get this kind of warmth at many places. I really hope the magic lasts."}
{"text":"4.8 Stars VIBE  Backyard Urban BBQ Patio meets Algonquin Park. Fitting! I love the Canadiana touches like the Hudson's Bay jugs. Service is incredible and the cooks are cute!   One note on reservations: guys, you need to make sure you're picking up the phone and that I don't have to follow up 4 times. I'm persistent but making a reservation shouldn't be a hassle for the customer.   I also can't control other big parties but as a result, we waited a half hour when we were on time. That said, the server fed 8 in an hour. We were smart to have written down everything we wanted by the time we sat.   WE ATE  Oh, we ate!   HITS  It is all about the baby back ribs with pesto. These ribs far surpass those of Stockyards and I am now dreaming of them on rotation.   We got extras of: smoked mozzarella and roast garlic bread (a tad pricey!) and the grilled corn salad side (damn!)   Our favourite sides:  Grilled Corn Salad FTW Potato Salad (wowza)  Pork and beans (a nice hot compliment)   The underdog was the Steel head trout poke. WOW. All of these flavours compliment one another with the smokiness of the trout and the texture of the chips /peanuts and spiciness of the chili, ginger and soy. We were picturing a trout head but it's not like that at all. Trout is cut up and it's served in a bowl like nachos. I am so glad we got this.   NOT SO MUCH  Again, everything here was tasty but these were the dishes I weren't feeling:  Jerk Chicken wings with pineapple -- wings were a bit charred for my liking and I didn't really taste the flavor in this dish. I wanted to like it more. I didn't really like the presentation of the pineapple (does this make me a douchebag? Probably...I sound like an old lady).   Cubanello peppers and eggplant - great for vegetarians but not as impressive as the other sides.   The ice cream sandwiches. Again, I wanted to love these more and you can definitely split this but I wasn't feeling the size of it --it's a bit awkward to eat and I think there's too much brioche. But bonus points on creativity for this. They were definitely a hit with our group, though! And don't underestimate the PB&J sammie.  DRINKS  The Bohemian Cooler is FANTASTIC. Plus, the ginger beer is from Thomas Lavers. DELISH! The Margarita - it was boozy but I'm not a fan of slushy margaritas. (I'm partial to the one at La Carnita).    NOTES  It would have been great for us to have split bills (especially with our drinks or to prepay on our drinks) but at the same time with a big group, it gets complicated so we sucked it up. But: they only charge a certain gratuity for groups over ten.   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  This is a fun place for a group if you're willing to wait. You will be crowing all the way home from this feast."}
{"text":"Good food, good music. Really loud and busy on a Friday night, but to be expected.  Staff was decent but not very attentive. Decent beer selection. The menu is ok but nothing great. Good place to go with some friends but wouldn't recommend it for a date night."}
{"text":"This has been on my long list of brunch spots to try, and I was excited to try it out. The service was friendly, the atmosphere cozy and kitschy in a great way. I was underwhelmed by my choice off the menu - the Coca Cola Brisket. There were a lot of sweet ingredients which I found to complete with each other. Our side order of schmaltz hash was flavourful though and made me think I'll return to try another menu item. While I had my coffee, my partner had the milkshake of the day (my man-child). Vietnamese coffee with dulce de leche and coconut - so good! I got a good vibe from the place and though my food choice was a (personal) miss, I think we'll be back for a second go."}
{"text":"Brunch is king in Toronto.  Breakfast is normally my favorite meal to order in a restaurant, and when i can order that same food on the weekend and a bit later, thats when it becomes brunch.  There are so many places that serve this preferred meal of  mine, and if you expect to get a table at a city favourite, prepare to wait or pay the price.  Rose and Sons with its small amount of Yelps, is somehow flying below the radar.  We entered the restaurant around 10 am on a Sunday, and the place was packed.  I did a rough count and the place holds about 40 people, five of those being seats at the bar, which is where we dined.  There were four staffers and they truly worked as a team, each were doing their share to help out and serve everyone in the restaurant.  If you  regularly eat brunch, you get accustomed to seeing the same items on a menu.  I was really impressed at the creativity.  I ordered the grilled romaine with anchovy dressing an toscano, for $11 with a side of bacon $4 and toast $2.  I was served an entire heart of romaine, that was halved, grilled, and spread with an anchovy dressing and topping with grated toscano.  This dish was so fabulous, the entire heart of lettuce was heated through, i would've liked mine to be left on the grill for just a bit longer though.  I loved the brininess of the anchovies paired with the cheese, it was wonderful.  As good as it was i do think that $11 is a bit expensive when a pack of three hearts retails for under $5, that being said i would still order it again.  I ordered a side of bacon, and two of the thickest pieces i have ever seen arrived to the table.  They were perfectly cooked, and had so much delicious fat, and it just melted in my mouth.  The side of toast that i ordered came without jam, but after i asked they provided me with a ramekin of sour cherries preserves.  The buttery toast paired so well with the cherries, however this toast was too hard, luckily for me i have young teeth, this could have easily resulted in a broken tooth for another diner.   Overall, one of the best brunch spots that i have been to in awhile, the service was super friendly and genuine, i will definitely return."}
{"text":"Enjoyed it very much. Whatever kind of batter they put on the fried chicken is dope as hell. Definitely grab them when you're there. Upgrade their fries and it's all mixed with fried onions, cheese, etc. Coleslaw on point too. We grabbed the mystery tap which was a lager that tasted pretty damn good. All together about $60 which isn't bad for an awesome meal. Definitely get there early or you'll have a bit of wait since the place isn't that big."}
{"text":"Super tiny hole-in-the-wall but damn awesome food establishment.  The service is great and the food is fantastic.  You have to go early if you plan to walk in and get a seat for weekend brunch, but they have iPads and text messaging happening so you can walk around outside while you wait.  We wanted to try everything on the brunch menu but alas, ordering a peanut butter milkshake as part of brunch sorta made us feel like we went too far already :-)  Definitely would return or try one of the other DuPont restaurants that's run by the same former Chef of the Drake."}
{"text":"While I'm not usually a fan of greasy spoons and diners, I was coaxed into joining gastronome blogger Viviana M and Tamara M for some finger licking noms at Rose & Sons.     It's not your usual diner atmosphere, no gum snapping waitresses named Flo and no 18 wheelers parked outfront.  If anything I'd classify Rose and Sons as a White Collar diner with a hipster kinda vibe.  It's uber-tiny inside and seating is comprised of cozy little wooden booths, which were indeed packed with patrons and the miniscule bar area makes the place feel like a throwback speakeasy.    The menu was scrawled out on mirrored boards up on the walls, but it was pretty dim so we took on the recommendations of the host and owner.  The Brother Juniper's Corn Bread was our starter, with an unexpected twist of maple syrup, hot sauce and green onions...trust me as rogue as that combo of flavours sounds, it's actually amazing!    Next came our entrees with Viviana having the Coca Cola Brisket with a yummy looking side of twice baked stuffed potato,  Tamara with a good ole fashioned patty melt (pretty much a grilled cheese sandwich witha chubby pink centred beef patty) and fries, and me with the whitefish with creamed butternut squash and green sauce.       While I'll say the food was flavourful in a gastropub \"stick-to-your-ribs\" kind of way, we weren't feeling all the love at Rose & Sons.  Despite the fact the owner was demonstratively polite and did his very best at assuming charming mannerisms the whole experience felt rushed.  I do understand space is at a minimum here, but considering that Rose & Sons serves fine wines and that a decent meal costs approximately $50 per person, having a nice meal hurried along does not leave a good taste in one's mouth.  It's a 2.75 stars for me."}
{"text":"Pretty interesting place. This is what I'd consider New Canadian food. A little expensive but kinda totally fine for a once-in-a-while thing. I'd love to come back here again for a dinner meal."}
{"text":"This place is new and still more interesting and hip than simply delicious.  I am sure they will get better in time.  They need to focus more on taste and service."}
{"text":"small but beloved Annex brunch hotspot.. my favorite place in the city http://bit.ly/1ilzFsn"}
{"text":"Gotta say I'm a little surprised with the mediocre reviews for this restaurant! I came here on the long weekend with my bf for brunch. Got there at noon and unfortunately we did have to wait around 40 mins for a table. However, it was well worth the wait! We sat at the bar and had a full on view of the kitchen watching the chefs in action so that was cool. Only thing I didn't like was that the bar seats were drilled to the ground so not adjustable, but the seating was a little too tight as my knees were rubbing against the wall which was quite uncomfortable.  Started with freshly squeezed grapefruit juice ($5) - it was in a decent sized glass cup so that was convincing.   Coca cola brisket cornbread ($16) This was AMAZING! This was really tasty. A huge slice of corn bread, topped with a spread of brie cheese, then topped with a layer of beef brisket, finished with a fried sunny side up egg on top with sweet and sour sauce. The beef brisket meat was unexpectedly tender which also made it so much more amazing. Only thing I wasn't sure was if it was supposed to have coca cola flavor (given the name), but if so I didn't taste any cola flavor from the brisket. I usually don't like cornbread, but this cornbread was really good! It wasn't too sweet, and the edges were nice and crispy, went really well with the sweet and sour sauce too. This is definitely a must try!  Daily Special - Pork belly crepe ($15) This seemed like a Vietnamese inspired dish. It was a different style of crepe than I imagined - wasn't thin or chewy with a slight crisp, but slightly soggy due to all the sauce that was added. There was a lot of veggies (cucumbers and carrots) which made it nice and refreshing. Almost as if it was to balance out the grease and fat from the pork belly meat. I personally felt this dish lacked in flavor, really relied on the hot sauce which I asked for on the side.  We also ordered a side dish of their hash - this was really good! It was mixed with caramelized onions which added extra flavor to the hash. The hash was like shredded fried hashbrown pieces which was nice and crispy. Addictively good!  Service was good, and so was the food. Overall I really liked my experience and would recommend people coming here for brunch!"}
{"text":"Visiting from Baltimore, USA, and using public transportation, I smelled the coming delight half a block before I found my way to the back of Rose and Sons. I asked the guy who took my drink order a question about the BBQ.  Next thing, Chef Sandy came out personally and I ended up with the most succulent rabbit, paired with a wake-up-your-mouth sauce.  The garlic bread appetizer came first, with smoked mozzarella and plenty of cloves.  I was able to enjoy some Miami Ribs -- which, though warned they are chewy, were actually mighty tender.   The wait staff could not have been more welcoming or attentive.  Their recommendations of food and drink held up well.  The attention and personability of the chef put it all over the top.  I absolutely love the rustic setting, and was satisfied and warm in the \"tent\" on a fairly cool day.   With great food, engaged staff, and comfortable / rustic surroundings, I'm shouting the praises of the Big Crow."}
{"text":"The Service: Comically pretentious - First time I walk in and the most absurdly pretentious hipster prods me to find out if I have a 'reso'. I didn't but knew i had to come back - Second time, (no reso needed), sit down for what ended up being an incredibly tasty lunch. - If I wasn't a lighthearted person I would have found our service downright rude, condescending and unprofessional... I just found it hilarious. Part of the experience. - The forks are put in a cup beside our table. - The waiter asks us \"why dont you be a team player and grab the forks\" as she brings our first order - She was so shocked I didn't set the table with my fork BEFORE she brought the food she scolded us and begrudgingly reached over our table to start doing it before rudely instructing us to. Condescendingly remarking that we must \"expect someone else to set the table at home\" - Conversely... we were just waiting for our food before we whipped out the cutlery... In my mind its rude to presumptuously and eagerly set that stuff up before the food comes. It's almost like it might say \"hurry up were ready\". We were happy to do it and laid our cutlery down with a genuine smile. Just saw no reason to do it before the food came... - The waiter serves the food while saying \"food\".   - Strange experience but....  The Food: Undeniably delicious - Clever - Interesting - Comforting - Great portions  - Inspiring options - The grits, sauce, everything about them is unreal.  Edit: now been a few times. great food.  Update: July 2015. Service is lovely! These people care about good food and the OX tongue quesadilla I just had screams that!"}
{"text":"Consistently ranked one of the best brunch spots in the city, I figured it was time to give it a try. I visited on a holiday Friday, so they didn't have their weekend brunch menu available, but it was still a positive experience!  First off, they have very good coffee here. As any breakfast joint should!   I ordered the PLB Melt for my meal. It's a grilled cheese sandwich with fried egg, bacon, sausage, sautéed onions and pickle in between two hearty slices of rye bread. It's also served with a homemade cherry jelly sauce. The bacon/sausage here are incredible, and the combination with the pickle, onions, eggs was great. Was surprised how well the sweet cherries worked with the rest of the flavours - very impressed!  The only gripe I have, and it's a small one, is the rye bread was thick and quite dense. It was tasty bread, but a bit difficult to cut through and chew through. Some might find it to also make the sandwich a tad dry but I'm a bread fan so didn't bother me too much!  Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"This is a small place, so be prepared to takeout if you can't sit down. My friend and I both had the pastrami sandwiches and they were very, very good. Best I've had in Toronto. For me there was a bit too much salt, and a bit too little other pastrami spices, notably cracked pepper and coriander. But my standard is Katz's on the Lower East Side of New York.   I had the potato and onion won ton knish, and while it was good, I don't think putting it in a won ton added anything. Go traditional.   I recommend this resto, and am confident you will enjoy it. And, no, it's not really cheap, but good delis aren't."}
{"text":"What a neighbourhood gem!   Best BBQ ever, get the jerk chicken wings! Get the rabbit. The smokey flavour is unreal!  Fantastic vibe (rustic Hudsons' Bay) but not overwhelmingly so. The blankets are great. The music was 90's hip-hop. How awesome is that!"}
{"text":"I had a great dinner at Rose & Sons, and wanted to come back to try their brunch. Since the restaurant is quite small, we should have known to come earlier (we arrived around 11:30), and we had to wait for a good half hour before getting seated.   Fried chicken and soft 'n sexy grits with poached egg and green sauce ($17)- Having previously sampled Rose & Sons' fried chicken before, I was pretty confident that this was going to be an awesome dish. I was not disappointed! Is there anything better than perfectly done fried chicken topped with a runny egg? The creamy grits were also excellent (super flavourful!), but extremely filling and the only component that I couldn't finish.   Griddled brie cornbread- brisket, fried egg, maple syrup and chili sauce ($15)- my friend is a cornbread and brie cheese lover so it's no surprise that she went for this dish. I'm not a big fan of brie cheese but tried all the other components. The cornbread was delicious- buttery and sweet, and I loved the flavour combination of the maple syrup and chili sauce. However, the brisket was a little tough, in my opinion. Overall, it was still highly enjoyable.   Bread Pudding with wild blueberries ($9)- For something sweet, we shared a bread pudding, which I've heard good things about. Although it didn't blow my mind off, it was tasty and ended the meal in a satisfying sweet note.   All in all, brunch at Rose & Sons did not disappoint, and I would specifically recommend the fried chicken and grits."}
{"text":"Down a sketchy alley, the spot is hard to find.  In the winter it is closed off and looks like a sauna as its walls are made entirely of planks of wood.  Inside they use radiant heat that simulates the feeling of a warm fire.  There are long benches and informal long tables.  The atmosphere is totally unique and works well.  It feels like you are in a Nordic cottage in the middle of nowhere.     The food itself is spectacular.  It is brought out on simple wooden plates and offers smoked versions of about any meat you can think of.  My favorite was the octopus.   Great location for a number of people and for sharing.    Look forward to coming back in good weather when it is opened up like a big outdoor BBQ.  Fantastic spot."}
{"text":"How is the alley way to the resto \"sketchy\"? LOL. There's pretty lights on the trees and lights against the main building. You can clearly see where you are going. Just saying.  Now to the food - been here twice in the past couple weeks for the $24.99(/person) Hibernation dinner (only available Sun-Wed). It is well worth it! A portion for 2 can easily fit 3-4 people and a portion for 4 can easily fit 5-6 people.   First round: breads and salad. The 1st time was served bread with smoked salmon. 2nd time was bread with homemade brushetta and another one served with a chimuchiri-type sauce.  Second round: pork and beans, cheesy grits, slaw, and a meat platter - sausage, ham-type meat, chicken, liver, brisket and whatever else they want to throw in there.  Third round: glass of milk with a platter full of different type of dessert bars - nanaimo, lemon tart, brownies, etc.  I would like to go back to try the ribs & the ice cream sandwich but for first timers or people on the cheap - the Hibernation dinner is one of the best deals in town."}
{"text":"pastrami sandwich and fries  fries were excellent  pastrami was somewhat dried out and the bread was stale  volume level due to the \"music\" was ear splitting"}
{"text":"My review of Rose & Sons at this point is based solely on breakfast/brunch as I have yet to try their dinners but based on the experiences I have had on my two visits I can promise you that an updated dinner review is not too far off. My first experience at Rose & Sons was a pure food orgasm, I had the braised pork shoulder on maple grits with poached eggs and it was a thing of beauty. My girlfriend stuck with the more traditional breakfast which consisted of eggs, hash and a sausage. The sausage was amazing and so was the hash, really done well and not just your typical breakfast. My second experience at Rose & Sons I enjoyed the Eggs in Hell as it was called which was two poached eggs, bbq pulled pork, on a biscuit all covered with a nice ancho chilli bbq sauce and a sweet slaw. Although not as amazing as my pork and grits from last time (which unfortunately is not on the new menu) it was still an amazing meal. Great place with a great atmosphere and amazing service. I'm a huge fan of Rose & Sons"}
{"text":"Im giving a 4 star rating because of the delicious food they have, super good but very pricey,i use to come her for brunch and i would always end up having, the all day breakfast,and at the end of my meal,my bill would come up to 50 dollars plus tips, so i find it a bit to pricey in my opinion, but its defiantly a good place to try it out, perhaps not to be regulars only if you could afford it."}
