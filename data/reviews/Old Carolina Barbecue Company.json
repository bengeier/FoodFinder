{"text":"Highly disappointed in this place.  First of all the line is long, the pick up register was empty and could have been used to make the line move quicker. We were not told that the sauces were at a station. When we got our meals my mac and cheese was cold and the pulled chicken sandwich was dry.  To top it off, all of the buns on our sandwiches were soggy and fell apart.  Overall save your money, there are better bbq places than this one."}
{"text":"I usually don't enjoy these quick service restaurants, but we were craving some BBQ and there just aren't many choices. So glad we tried this place-the food was really good. Good ribs, good pulled pork, nice sides, FANTASTIC french fries-and I don't joke about fries. These things are the real deal, worth going just for them and some cheer wine. Banana pudding, sweet tea - this place is as close to southern as you will find in the east suburbs. Also, they keep it clean in there, the staff is nice and helpful, and overall a good BBQ experience!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and excellent meal. I went there last night with my brother and the food was great as always. Along with great food this place obviously cares about customer service."}
{"text":"Order took forevvvvver. The portions were small. The sauce is nothing to shout about. Tables were messy. This place will close soon."}
{"text":"Kinda like the chipotle for bbq. A little something for everyone, plenty of choices. Everything we had was good. Definitely returning!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went last night and decided on to takeout ribs, mashed potatoes and \"the best beans ever\".  The ribs and BBQ sauce were excellent, even after the 20min ride home. Ribs were very meaty and tender with a good dry rub. She liked the original BBQ sauce. I had the fiery beaver sauce, mustard sauce and original. I like all of them. Will definitely return for more.   The sides were not so great. They were just average tasting to both of us."}
{"text":"Recently open. Decent location. Ribs were a little dry. Chicken was excellent. Sides were mediocre. If you are looking for soul food level bbq this is NOT the place. If you are looking for chain restaurant level bbq this is better than most.We ate in the restaurant and the staff seemed a bit confused because when you order you are given a number then you seat yourself and the staff has to look for you. Good value for the money. Clean environment. Banana pudding is fantastic."}
{"text":"I've been here 10-12 times since they opened, and I'm amazed at how consistent they are.  I've never had anything but very friendly, professional service; an exceptionally clean restaurant; and really good food.  The pork is great, but the pulled chicken, turkey, ribs, and brisket are also worth coming for.  The Brunswick stew is a really unique side (potatoes, tomatoes, corn, lima beans, pulled pork).  They do have a kids' menu, and even if your kid isn't a huge fan of barbecue, they will love the hot apple sauce (trust me) and vanilla wafers, so even little kids will be happy to go with you.  The sauces are not on the tables, but that's fine with me because they're kept warm in dispensers, which is a nice touch because the warm sauce incorporates much better than cold or room temperature sauce."}
{"text":"Great food Great staff and clean place. What else could you ask for ribs ribs and ribs"}
{"text":"Really don't know what these other people have eaten for BBQ. Everything was with little taste, dry, boring. Hot Sauce Williams kills this place. It was empty on Mon after the 1st. I don't see it getting better even if this was their average effort. I think maybe that Cleveland's expectations of BBQ are low. Never eat there again. And will spread the word."}
{"text":"Top notch.  My favorite bbq in the area.  Pulled pork, brisket, and turkey are excellent.  Working through the rest of the options will be a pleasure.  I'm not a huge fan of their sauces but the meats stand on their own and are honestly better without a lot of sauce covering up their true flavors.  The pulled chicken was so so and I will be back to work through the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"This our first time of trying here ,it wasn't very busy , we had the pulled pork platters .the pork was very tender . However they were out baked beans and they didn't mention at the time of ordering. Also the cornbread that should of came with it wasn't available due to still in the oven . One worker named Hailey did her best to offer desserts in place of corn bread . If we wanted deserts we would of ordered them"}
{"text":"Great ribs, chicken, brisket and turkey! All smoked to perfection. My family can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"Previously we have had good experiences at Old Carolina and loved their food. I even ordered their catering services for an art opening for my thesis show. However I was super shocked and disgusted at my latest visit. There were flies in the back landing in food, one of the servers was scratching his head and then handling food, and the woman from the cash register didn't put gloves on or wash her hands before handling food either.   We did take the coleslaw we ordered but after eating it the two people who ate it ended up getting sick and the one person who didn't was fine. I might go to another Old Carolina in the future but I likely won't be going to the one in Stow anymore."}
{"text":"After eyeballing this new eatery in Stow, I finally decided to take a chance and experience Old Carolina firsthand last night. Suffice to say, I was pleased with the delicious outcome.  But before that, let me take a moment to explain the layout, for I, myself, was surprised to see that it wasn't exactly a restaurant as I had initially assumed. Nay, it isn't a restaurant, but it isn't a fast food parlor either. The best (and most widely-recognized) comparison I can think of is Chipotle, except at Old Carolina you can actually sit down and have your food brought out to you after ordering.  Anyway, the menu consist of many barbequesque foods, for example pulled pork, chicken, ribs, hot dogs etc., but yeah I only got the pulled pork sandwich \"Carolina Style\" (aka with coleslaw and their own special coastal vinegar for only a measly 79Â¢). To supplement this tasty concoction they also offer a bevy of sauces, from which you can pick as many of as wide a variety as you want. They really don't seem to care how much you take with you. It all comes together to make, in my opinion, a mindblowingly satisfying meal. Oh, right, I got their mashed potatoes with it. Those were good, too. As someone who is nearly perpetually hungry, I was pleased to find that I wasn't craving food again for the rest of the day. Soul food is good for the spirit and bottomless stomach alike, indeed, dear reader.  Bonus: I ordered from there again tonight for carry out, and upon getting home realized they forgot my mashed p's. That's bad, right? WRONG! When I drove back (a paltry 1 mile from where I stay) to get my mashed noms, which I wasn't even upset about, the cashier Bryan gave me a card for a free meal next time. Thus the true hallmark of customer appreciation can be born witness to.  So yes, in conclusion I would recommend Old Carolina to anyone who doesn't have any scruples about consuming calorie-dense Southern food.  TL;DR: tasty southern food ahoy! It's a hybrid between restaurant and fast food dining experiences. Don't lie about them forgetting your side dish just so you can get a free meal card because that'd make you a douchebag."}
{"text":"Being from out of town and loving bbq, I decided to give Old Carolina bbq co. a try. I went with a group of 5 and when we walk through the door, we were greeted by a very pleasant individual by the name of David. He was ready and willing to explain the menu if we had any questions.  After ordering, our food came out in a very timely manner with the same kind and pleasant service as when we walked in. All the plates we had were great tasting and the pulled pork was a favorite of the group. I highly recommend this restaurant for anyone who is in the area. So glad I stopped in."}
{"text":"HEY DICKEY'S!!!  Pack it up and get out there's a new Sheriff in town. You know you're in the right place as soon as you step over the thresh hold and your nostrils fill with beautiful pungent smoke. This is as close to real 'Cue as you're gonna get unless you're eating at my house. Ordered the Two Meat Platter with fries as both sides. Brisket n Pork so tender you don't have to chew it but go ahead and squeeze out all that delicious smokey flavor. Perfect fries, just crispy enuff outside and pillowy tender inside just like at the Fair.  Did I mention they leave the skins on?the skins on.  My son ordered the Pulled Pork sandwich. Moist juicy and tender porky goodness piled high on a soft bun. It was sixty cent wing night not to be confused with fiddy cent Fridays. Good sized wings full of meat but not quite smoked like we thought they would be but hey who's going to argue with sixty cent wings?  A couple of back seat restaurant  advice tips. The cornbread is good but not everyone likes cornbread. How about the authentic down home 2 slices of generic white bread on the side to sop up those unique flavorful sauces. The other tip would be since it's all about Carolina and vinegar sauces are king in that area how about some bottles of apple cider vinegar on the tables for those fries. They're just begging for it.  Lastly an unlimited supply of Cheerwine that down south cherry soda that's so hard to find here up north."}
{"text":"I was picking up an online order at 7:30, for 10 minutes I waited in the pick up line. Only one person ahead of me. Once the girl with multi-colored hair finally finished. She looked at me. Then proceeded to check the potatoes and left. I was standing still in the pickup line while the cashier helped 10 people in line. I went to the order line while the cashier helped a man with his pickup who just walked in. The cashier then proceeded to get people's order ready and bus tables. Another 10 minutes pass and she finally asks if I need help. Seriously? No I don't need help, just like to stand in line at restaurants and watch people work. I then asked the cashier why the multi-colored hair person wasn't manning the pick up line, she said she's a supervisor and is talking to the managers. Basically, they only had two people working while all the managers are in the back, not helping them out. Not a sorry you had to wait, nothing. I totally blame management why I had to wait in line 20 minutes while my food was ready the whole time and now cold."}
{"text":"Reduced rating to 2 stars from 4.   Both service and quality are dependant on who is working that day...."}
{"text":"The ribs, which I guess are probably the main focus of the restaurant, were pretty decent. At times the smoke flavor felt a little forced, but overall they were satisfying. Green beans, which are usually always mushy in restaurants, were here too, which was disappointing. I was also confused with how a mac an cheese with 4 cheeses in it could manage to have so little flavor. That was made better by mashing up a hush puppy in it... other than that I liked the sauces and I thought it was cute that they had cheerwine, which kind of fills the \"random uncommon fountain soda\" slot I like to see. Atmosphere was ok, just normal families and people. They were playing good late 60s rock when i was in there and that was nice. Overall it's passable if you're craving it, or go with family, but it didn't really \"excel\" to me personally in such a way I'd want to go back for the food."}
{"text":"No stars the meat is cold dry  enhance the taste of chemicals not wood the sauce all 5 6 7 of them are absolutely hideous not a one tasted good they're baked beans are horrible mashed potatoes aren't any good either and I love instant mash potato mash potato run over by a truck any kind of mash potato I like and these are horrible the macaroni and cheese has bread crumbs on them and I don't like that and they are way too expensive you better on two banks to go here if this is the way barbecue is in the Carolinas I never want to go they should name the place old meat not old Carolina have absolutely nothing good to say about this place the ribs from Sams Club are better than this and they bake them do yourself a favor and stay away from old Carolina it's a mistake hiding under a big corporate name the McRib is better look elsewhere not here buyer beware dry turkey dry brisket cold pulled pork what more can I say just stay away"}
{"text":"I love it here!! Especially the private room!! We had our rehearsal dinner here and it was cozy and affordable!!"}
{"text":"I come here all the time, try to at least come once a month. I love the food, especially the pulled pork. The meat is always so tender and the BBQ sauces are all good. My favorite is the classic. It's hard to choose between their sides when I go, but I always make sure to get the baked beans. They aren't lying when they say simply the world's greatest."}
{"text":"Wife & I have eaten in a few times, also had take-out -- food has been good, decent portions.  I've tried all the sauces, each good in it's own way.  Jalapeno slices help.  Reminds me of a small-scale Bandanna's, which we knew from St Louis.  We get the pulled pork plates usually, as the sandwich buns tend to disintegrate.  Baked beans & cornbread good, green beans & mashed potatoes okay, haven't tried the other sides yet.  This place was my introduction to Cheerwine, now on my list of soda faves."}
{"text":"Great food and amazing staff! There was an issue with my gift card and Sadie handled it immediately and went ABOVE AND BEYOND! The dining room was full and there was quite a line but every person in there was so friendly and happy to be doing their jobs! Excellent customer service!"}
{"text":"We went at 8:15pm on a Friday and they had put away most of the food for the night. When we finally was able to find something that was still \"available\", it was rather gross. There was no flavor to the chicken, and everything was cold. Have not been back since."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in Strongsville! On my first visit here I wasn't sure about what sauce to get and the staff was so helpful. I had a large take out order and they let me take samples of a variety of sauces to try! They were all delicious. Pricing is reasonable and we were very satisfied with this ribs and pulled pork."}
{"text":"This place is great. It is one of the best BBQ places in the greater Cleveland area. The ribs are tender and meaty. The brisket has a nice smoke ring. I love the vinegar based coleslaw. The restaurant itself is clean and has a nice modern rustic dÃ©cor."}
{"text":"Was eager to try OCBC. I was excited to see they have hush puppies since that's a rarity in most restaurants around here. I love pulled pork so I got the pulled pork plate(no bread, 1 side). Wasn't very busy there but took almost 20 minutes to get my food. Odd shape to the hush puppies (see the picture) but they had a nice crunch and a little on the sweet side. Pretty tasty. Pulled pork was just warm rather than hot temperature wise and a little dry. Got some original sauce and the tangy mustard gold sauce. Tasted the celery seed in the gold and liked the tang but overall the pork was just meh. Might try the brisket in the future but it could be a while."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch with my boyfriend. We were on this side of town visiting maple side farms. I ordered the brisket sandwich with Mac and cheese and hush puppies. My boyfriend ordered the pulled pork, fries and coleslaw. As usual, we shared both meals. Both the brisket and pulled pork were tasty, fries nice and crisp, slaw was ok, hush puppies were ok, Mac and cheese was pretty good. We sampled all of the sauces they had out and the original was great.  Overall, everything was good, but I don't feel like we would go back again if we were on this side of town. Not because it was bad, but just because we like to try different things and nothing exceptional stood out that would make us die to get back here."}
{"text":"We ordered the combination platter with beef brisket, ribs, smoked turkey, pulled chicken, and pulled pork. The cole slaw was creamy and good, the garlic mashed were fair. The traditional sauce was sweet and mild. The atmosphere is casual and child-friendly. Great place to go to get in and out. Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Solid overall. Got a little bit of everything. Wings were crispy. Pulled pork was the star of the show. Sauces were tasty and sides were above average. Ribs and brisket were decent. Staff was friendly and restaurant was clean."}
{"text":"Nice smoke ring on the ribs. Pulled pork was very tender and juicy.  Beans were sweet ans tangy with big pecices of brisket in them. Good value. The key to this place is you have to hit it in a day/ time when get fresh smoked food.. Sometimes it seems you get the previous days smoked product and is not good."}
{"text":"Been here about 3 times for lunch.   I'm not a fan.  One of the first things that bothered me was that the ordering process is awkward.  You order at a counter, like you're at a fast food place.  They then give you a cup for soda and a number and say they'll bring the food to your table.  So you get your drink and sit down.  When the food finally comes, the sauces are BACK where the soda is (rather than just in bottles at the tables) so you have to get back up walk over, get your sauce, and then come back to the table.  It sounds like a dumb thing to complain about... but it's so unnecessary to have patrons shuffling back and fourth in the restaurant from the order counter, to the soda fountain, to the table, to the sauce area, then back to the table.  If it was just regular fast food ordering OR regular restaurant ordering it would make more sense.  On top of the awkward ordering process... the food really isn't that good.  I've been to BBQ places and LOVED them.  This place just doesn't do it for me.  Honestly, only time I've NOT enjoyed a pulled pork sandwich was here."}
{"text":"First visit. Due to location and outward appearance I thought it would be a good eating experience.  While placing my order they were out of 3 items I wanted, and got substitutions.  When we got our order our food was edible but nothing special. Meat flavor was ok. Hush puppies excellent.  BBQ sauce average.  Course I won't be returning, found it to be nothing special."}
{"text":"1st time there and the service was very good. Aaron came to me and welcomed me has I was looking at the menu. He also asked if he could answer any questions. I got the pulled chicken and pulled pork sandwich with garlic skins on mashed potato and 4 cheese mac and cheese. The chicken was moist and for 6 bucks you got good amount. Put the gold bbq sauce on it was a bit let down on the sauce. 4 mac and cheese really good and the pulled pork again a lot of meat for 6 bucks. The regular bbq sauce was much better. Overall it was worth the money. No 5 star cause I'm a bbq snob and I never got any smoke flavor."}
{"text":"If you have an event, I cannot recommend Carolina Barbecue enough for the catering.  From helping you to pick out the menu to the final service on the day of event to clean- up they really do it all!     I know we are a little biased, but we really truly felt like our wedding was the best day ever!  And a  big part of the day going so well was Carolina Barbecue.  I can't even begin to tell you about all of the compliments we have received about the team.  In addition to the food being absolutely delicious, we heard time and time again how friendly and warm the staff was to all of the guests.  We especially appreciated how organized dinner service was!  Knowing our experience up until that point, we shouldn't have expected anything less, but it was just a relief knowing that everyone was able to get through the food line and back to their seats to enjoy their meals in such a timely manner.  It's actually really funny because my aunt came up to me and was like Grace when is the dance floor opening up and I realized that everyone was getting antsy because they had eaten dinner so quickly!!  In addition to doing a great job with dinner service, the staff did a great job keeping the event space tidy throughout the evening.  When we came back to the venue the next day to do final clean- up, nearly all our work had been done for us.  All we had to do was take our centerpieces!"}
{"text":"My head is spinning that the reviews of this place aren't better than they are. Just reading through a smattering of them I see people mention they vacation in Carolina a lot and feel the food is subpar/inauthentic, or they don't feel the decor is truly \"southern\". I guess people are entitled to an opinion.  I was born and raised in the North Carolina Sandhills (recent transplant to NEO) and to me, old Carolina represents the closest thing to what I grew up eating (the best bbq on this earth) and the decor looks exactly like a new construction joint anywhere in the piedmont/coast of NC.   Do yourself a favor and get the pulled pork/slaw/piedmont#5 with an extra dose of coastal Carolina vinegar."}
{"text":"This company is focused on great food and great customer service. They are indeed great at both. Brisket is delicious and it's one of the best spots to enjoy bbq in the area. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I stopped in for the first time and ordered the two meet platter. Incredible! The meats were very tender and flavorful. The sauce selection is excellent! Lastly, the sides that I selected were as well prepared and delicious as the main course. Strongly recommend!"}
{"text":"We went to old Carolina in June 2014. I'm not quite sure what I expected, but when I got there, it definitely wasn't what I expected.   We got a big platter of three different meats to share, baked beans, mashed potatoes. I loaded us up with all different types of sauces so we could taste them by dipping each of the meats into them. And I went to the table with my husband and waited.  Before too long, the food came out. The closest I can say that it resembled was the food that we had at sea world in Florida. It was pink, as if it had smoke lines, but it was cold and in general, unappetizing. Even dipping into sauces with it and then finally pouring the sauces over it didn't improve the taste of the meat. I couldn't eat the mashed potatoes and the husband only ate two spoonfuls of the beans. The cornbread it all came out with it was like a little hockey puck.  We were looking for some good barbecue, but we found that at old Carolina...good barbecue isn't what they provide. We'll keep looking."}
{"text":"I've been to Old Carolina before and enjoyed it but that was a long time ago, so I was looking forward to this one opening mere minutes away from me.  My first visit was on a Saturday night and it was pretty busy.  We walked in and ordered to go.  The ordering was easy and the staff was very friendly - providing helpful answers to our questions.   The staff was overwhelmed a bit with the weekend dinner rush, but that will iron itself out with time and practice.      The food was really good.  I tried the pulled pork and 1/3 rack of ribs plate and was not disappointed.    The mac-n-cheese and creamy slaw were fine.     The second time in we tried ordering online and picking up.   Very quick, easy, convenient.  Actually a very nice experience as the staff was still friendly and helpful.     Food was again very good.   We got a pulled pork sandwich and brisket sandwich - both were excellent.   Love the sauce selection!  Try em all, pick your fave.  It always comes back to the classic sauce for me."}
{"text":"I feel as though this review is going to be kind of unfair, since I only had a salad and that's really stupid in general to get a salad at a BBQ place.   But the salad did have smoked chicken on it, which was really good, and it didn't taste like \"fake chicken\" that you get on so many salads from chain restaurants. It also had dried cranberries in it -- something different and appreciated.  The salad came with a roll & butter (more like a bun). I always like carbs with my greens.  What stood out mostly was the service. Very friendly and accommodating. (Even asked if I would like an extra bun for my \"extra bun.\" Hehe. (Not in those words though.)  I guess I'm keeping it at 3 stars because it wasn't a FANTASTIC meal, just pretty good."}
{"text":"We used the catering service for our wedding, most of the dishes tasted the same as the day we sampled. Overall we were pleased! Thank you Old Carolina!"}
{"text":"Was craving a really good pulled pork sandwich after a disappointing attempt at one from  a local restaurant. This place was great! The sauce was so so but the sandwich portion and meat quality was beyond what I expected. Very good! The baked beans are amazing bit the Mac and cheese is just OK. The banana pudding is meh. I can do without it next time. However, I WILL be back!"}
{"text":"This was the best local barbecue place I've been too. I haven't been down south. But I know vinegar based bbq is my favorite. The basked bend were outstanding. I could taste the cumin. The wings were my favorite. The ribs were good just kinda small. Over all it was a great experience and I will be back"}
{"text":"I am a BBQ freak and have been here several times, but just now getting around to reviewing it. I love to concept of an homage to Carolina barbecue, and these guys got it right.  Smoking all their meats right on-site makes all the difference in the world.  The bark on all their meats is a true sign of smoking perfection, and their slow-cook process seems to ensure juicy meats every time.  My two favorite are the ribs (I've always been a rib guy) and the beef brisket.  I recently also had a pulled pork sandwich and it was piled high and also quite tasty.  Side dishes are all solid...baked beans, green beans w/ ham, mac-n-cheese, hush puppies. I also like that you can get a dish of dill pickles (what else goes better the BBQ?)...and they have 4-5 different style of sauces to choose from, all kept hot in a small pumper station.  Please keep supporting this local chain...I'd hate to see them leave the area!!!"}
{"text":"If I could give it zero stars, I would. I placed a web order at 5:03pm for 6pm. Due to traffic, I arrived at 6:05. Couldn't get anywhere near the line for web orders due to the crowd, so I waited in line for approximately 15 minutes for an order that I already placed and paid for. Then I waited for another 25 minutes for food, which I only received because I complained. Got home and received 3 deformed, tough wings and great ribs on the top of the pack, a fatty mess underneath. In total, it took almost an hour to get my food. So, two hours from the initial order. Tip: look at your food carefully and don't bother with web orders. They don't deliver as promised."}
{"text":"Good dependable BBQ. This place is NOT knock your socks off, write home about it BBQ. But, it IS good. The ribs, pulled pork, and brisket are all very good. I've had all and liked all. It is VERY reasonably priced. Last time we got food from here it was to feed my buddies helping me build my deck. Every one dug in and complimented it. I'm so glad it's so close to the house."}
{"text":"I have always been a fan of Old Carolina. The flavors are awesome.  If there is one piece of advice I can give to the restaurant and diners it's this:  choose wisely when it comes to what time you want to eat at this place. At 11:30am and 5pm it is safe to assume the meat will be freshly prepared and not dried out.  The longer it sits in warming trays, the more dry it gets. Do not even think about going for a late lunch or late dinner here. That happened when I met a friend for dinner at 7pm. Meat was dry as hell.  I understand that the restaurant has a challenge with managing inventory and not wanting to make a fresh tray of BBQ meat at 7pm because the dinner surge is already over but they have got to find a way to put some steam on the food to keep moisture in it so it doesn't get dry."}
{"text":"Linda brought in a bag full of pulled pork for my staff today and it was truly the best bbq I've ever had!! The pork was perfection. My entire staff was very pleased with the food and it was a nice surprise for our weekly meeting! I cannot wait to stop in this weekend and try more!"}
{"text":"Maybe the worst BBQ I've ever had.  The chicken tenders in my daughter's meal were too salty to eat.  My ribs were tasteless and the chicken dry.    My wife's wings were over fried and over salted.   The only thing any of us had that was good were the BBQ beans.   Save your money.   You'd be better off with a McRib."}
{"text":"This location has great service.  They will bring the food out to you, clear it for you, and check on you to make sure everything is okay.  And everyone here is so nice.  Good stuff.  Gotta love the Screamin' Beaver sauce!"}
{"text":"So 4 stars is not because I think the BBQ is world class,  all thought it is pretty good, especially given he glaring lack of BBQ up here in the north.  But, when all things are considered, the quality of the meat, the quality of the sides and the price, this is worth a look see.  So from worst to first: Mac-n-cheese, the daughter loved it, the adults thought it was bland  Baked Beans were a hit all around, all though they were a touch under cooked  Brisket - had it as part of the combo.  It was okay stand alone, but I think it is cooked mainly for the sandwich  Pulled Pork  - Nicely done.  Works great with the vinegar and mustard based sauces  Wings - worth going to wing night over.  They are smoked and finished in the fryer for some crisp.  Great flavor  Ribs - done perfect.  Just a little tug to get them off the bone.  Nice and meaty.  4 bones as part of the combo is perfect.   Hush Puppies - If you don't know what they are, you just need to trust.  If you do know, these will make you smile.  FYI it is a fried corn bread of sort.  A staple in the southern food area"}
{"text":"We're here for lunch. None of us - my wife, son, or me - had been here before. All in all, we're quite satisfied with the food, service, and atmosphere. I'm sure we'll all be back.  I got the pulled pork platter with cornbread and a side of 4 cheese mac and cheese. The others got pulled pork or chicken, and everyone was satisfied. My banana pudding was a fitting desert to top it all off."}
{"text":"While the ribs were tasty, the overall experience leaves something to be desired.  Having only one register open at dinner time during the week is a problem, very long wait to order.  Maybe, as staff gains experience and customers understand the menu better, this will improve.  I didn't expect much of the salad I ordered and I didn't get much.  Rusty wilted lettuce with a packet of dressing.  I get it, it's not a veggie place, so perhaps they shouldn't even try.  Worth another try in a month or two when they get their feet under them, but overall, not a must for me."}
{"text":"I really love pulled pork and I really love true Carolina style barbecue sauce (I should, that's where I'm from!).  Everything we've tasted here has been so southern and yummy.  They have a sauce bar and I love them all.  It's also super kid-friendly which I love.    The butter for the cornbread and sweet and perfect.  Hush puppies are also good.   The portions are perfect and usually enough to share with my toddler.  They have some huge tables and they also have a rewards app.   It can take a few minutes to get your food but nothing outrageous."}
{"text":"We placed a huge 30-person order for a party we hosted in the backyard.  I ordered racks of ribs, pulled chicken, baked beans, and a variety of sauces.  The order was ready right on time for pickup, and all the food came in aluminum foil trays which were double-wrapped with plastic wrap and foil covers.  This sealed in the moisture and kept the food warm until we got it home and put it in chafing trays.  The manager was really helpful with estimating quantities of food (the web site and menu are helpful, too).  The food was met with rave reviews from everyone...especially the ribs.  They are really, really, good.  And messy good fun to eat :)"}
{"text":"UPDATE****** Management reached out after reading this review and was incredibly friendly & generous, sending me a coupon to give it another try. Unfortunately, it was still not good. I will say that it was better than the first time - but the meat was still dry. The brisket had the consistency of rubber. I definitely wanted to like it more the second time around because of how great management was; the best way to describe it was \"underwhelming\". 2 stars for this visit.   ----------------------------------------------------- I went in around 7:30 on a Tuesday night and it was genuinely the worst meat I've ever gotten from a bbq place. The pulled pork and brisket were incredibly dry. Even drenched in BBQ sauce it was not edible (and I was starving).   The girls working were very nice and the sides (mac n chz and creamy cole slaw) were decent. It was kind of pricey ($22 for two sandwiches with two sides).   I will definitely support local bbq places from now on that have great food (Jimmys Backyard BBQ in Cuyahoga Falls is delicious and very reasonably priced). I will never be returning to Carolina BBQ."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised. Went for lunch had the pulled pork and tried all the different sauces. I liked 2 of the four they had. I wasn't crazy about the setup for dinner (not your typical sit down restaurant with cozy seating) but great for lunch. Rustic finish inside was kind of like a chipotle  the service was great. Fries looked great although I ordered the cornbread (which was very good). I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were very excited that a restaurant opened near us since a different location cared or wedding 2 years ago. We loved Old Carolina's for then. We were very disappointed when we went to this location for lunch. The Mac n cheese was bland. The apples were a little dry. My husband said the turkey and chicken were tasteless and dry. I had a side salad that was a good size and had small hush puppies on it. The salad may have been the best thing. We are disheartened because we had hoped to relive our wedding reception. We would have never had the food today at our wedding. We hope the Rocky River location improves."}
{"text":"I'm from NC and their pulled pork is as close as you can get to Lexington without an 8 hour drive. I love how they leave the pork to its natural flavor and let you choose between Eastern NC style (vinegar base sauce) and Western NC style (sweet/tangy/spicy sauce). Ribs were good, but make no mistake about it, this Tarheel showed up for the true BBQ... pulled pork.  Add the Cheerwine on tap at the fountain, sweet tea right next to it... and I had escaped Yuppyville and was home temporarily."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been to Old Carolina many times. They have a few different sauces and a good selection of meats. Everything here is tender and full of flavor. They have pretty good vinegar slaw which goes really well on sandwiches.   I was down in Durham, NC in April of 2015 and I will tell you that this tastes exactly like the famous BBQ places down there which really impressed me.   The only drawback is the prices can be a little bit high, but still affordable.  Overall I would strongly recommend visiting here."}
{"text":"We ordered the two meat platter with beef brisket, pulled pork, Brunswick stew, and hush puppies. To be honest, the sides (Brunswick stew especially - good broth with abundant veggies) are better than the meat. The pulled pork is OK but the brisket seemed overcooked and very dry. (Eaten with hot sauce is the only good way to eat it.)  However, my husband and I share the platter, so it's a very cheap meal and fairly filling.  Sadly, I remember a time when they served better food (when it first opened).  I do love the restaurant concept though, and perhaps we just walked in at a very busy time."}
{"text":"So, I'm not usually much for chain restaurants, but Old Carolina Barbeque is not just a standard chain store.   They're concept of bringing a more authentic southern-style barbeque is quite a good one; they serve up a variety of smoked meats, from ribs to brisket to turkey, and hen let YOU figure out which sauce you like on it (there are, at present, four sauces to choose from, from savory to sweet, all of them good.)   Add to that a great variety of sides, from their amazing baked beans to huge hush puppies and other tasty fare and you've got some good eatin':)  Also, I have to say, the service was exceptional. My friends and I had a gathering there of about 30 people in their party room, which was spacious, clean and tidy, and the folks running the place were friendly and helpful, and all of our orders were delivered promptly to our tables.   So, if you're looking for something both sweet and savory, with just a hint of spice, head for Old Carolina Barbecue; it's actually quite nice!  (Yeah, it's corny, but I HAD to make it rhyme:)"}
{"text":"I'm not generally a BBQ person, but every now & then I get a hankerin'.    Mom & I stopped one Saturday afternoon for lunch.  She got the pulled pork and I got a salad.  Yeah, I hear you, a salad? you ask.  Yep, and it was good!  There were fresh hush puppies on it which were the perfect substitution for croutons!  Mom's sides were coleslaw (creamy) and baked beans.  I enjoyed the beans.  I'm not a creamy coleslaw chick but ma appeared to like it. There are approximately 4 different BBQ sauces to choose from; from spicy to sweeter.  All were good.    You order at the counter & they bring the food to your table.  Old Carolina BBQ is great for either dine-in or take-out.  They cater too.  In fact, I think I may be ordering from them in the future for a catered event.  Disclaimer: I AM NOT a BBQ expert.  I do not claim to be a connoisseur of BBQ, sauces, or qualities of meat.  I simply enjoyed my experience and would return again.  Good luck, I hope you enjoy it!"}
{"text":"I love OCB. I've gone to one of the Akron locations but the Stow one is closest to me. I like that you can pick your sides. The baked beans are unique as they have a few different types of beans mixed in. I love the pulled pork. It is nicely seasoned but served dry so you can choose from their various sauces according to your particular taste. I'm more of a sweet and savory bbq girl so I especially like this because lots of times, I think certain bbq is too hot and spicy for my taste. The fresh cut fries are a delicious side and they serve you a huge portion. I always leave this place feeling like I overdid it, but it's so good."}
{"text":"We moved to NE Ohio two years ago from NC and enjoy visiting this place for lunch to grab some pull pork and a Cheerwine.  Four stars for being located in NE Ohio, but about a three star rating if compared to authentic NC BBQ in the south.  Very hard to beat Lexington style BBQ."}
{"text":"Great Smokey flavor tender ribs brisket awesome as well"}
{"text":"Gave them another chance, and I'm happy I did. This time around they got everything right. I hope the changes they made are not temporary."}
{"text":"Everything seems to be made pretty fresh (so don't let your fries get cold). The ribs are tender and come off the bone easy, the chicken is juicy but the skin is heavily seasoned. The fries are fresh, but the Mac and cheese needs some more flavor to me. Overall, the prices are good and the food is pretty good too."}
{"text":"Best thing in this menu are the ribs. Green beans were mushy, chicken dry, cornbread tasted like it was from a box. Overall very disappointing"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch while in Stow and was very impressed.  I got the Brisket sandwich with Green Beans and Creamy Coleslaw.  The Brisket was excellent with a  nice smoke ring aound the outside and it was also very tender too.  Also, they give you a very niced sized portion and you have a choice of about 4 different BBQ Sauces. The sauces were all great but my favorites were the Mustard based sauce and Peidmont #5.    PS.-Please open up a location in Rocky River, Westlake, Avon, or Avon Lake we are starved for a good BBQ and Bubbas does not cut it."}
{"text":"We went there today at about two pm for a late lunch and  had the wonderful pulled pork meal we expected to receive. Very tasty.  However, we were not pleased by the level of cleanliness we found there. The meat prep area (which was not being used right then) needed a thorough clean up. The remains of what must have been a busy lunch rush were still to be seen on the knives, cutting table and the floor of the area. The large window invites you to look in so perhaps it should look presentable.  After ordering we went to find a table, but the first two were covered with liquids, crumbs and spilt bbq sauces.   The dirty plates and silverware were gone but nothing has been wiped down. We had to clean our table and seats ourselves before we sat down. The floors looked as though they hadn't seen a broom all day.   This turns off your guests."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. Just happened to type in \"bbq near me\" and this convenient spot came up. I ordered the two meat plate with pulled chicken and pork, it came with two sides I chose french fries and my personal favorite mac and cheese. The price for all that was only $12.49 which is a steal in my opinion. The pulled chicken and the fries were my top picks. I definitely will be coming back. Thanks for the great hospitality."}
{"text":"This is a Chipotle style BBQ place, but they deliver your order to your table.  Arrived at the Lyndhurst location at 5:30pm on a Saturday night, and there were approx. 12 people in front of us, had a solid wait time of 20 minutes before placing our order (1 cashier only).  I get it, it was a busy meal time - I do not mind the wait as long as the end result is good.  I had read the good and not so good reviews on Yelp & Urbanspoon, wanted to see for myself.  There were no menus available while we were in line (we were first-timers), there are menus on the walls, but you have to advance in line to see the entire selection.  I decided on the chicken breast with a couple of sides, a fairly simple order (or so I thought...).  Since the tables were filling up, I gave my hubby my order and got a table.   A few minutes later he comes over to say that they are out of chicken breast and I need to come to the counter and choose something else.   I am not a rib fan, the only chicken parts they had were legs & thighs (not my fave), so with the many eyeballs of those waiting in line (at least 20 minutes, like we did), willing me to choose and get out of the way, I ordered a side of garlic mashed potatoes - as my meal.  The attitude of the cashier was in no way \"sorry for the inconvenience\", more like I was in line at the charity soup kitchen, make up your mind and move along!  *note* - I made up my mind immediately, not like I held the line up!  I had just finished 8 busy hours working at Legacy Village, all I wanted was some nourishment!  The cashier did not tell us our order number, so as we sat at the table trying to find it on the receipt, we heard the food runners yelling out numbers...we were able to figure out what number we were based on what we heard being yelled out, it is printed in small type on the printed receipt, but no where does it say \"your order number is...\"  My mashed potatoes were OK, not great, not awful, not as seasoned as I expected. The side portion was like a scoop of ice cream.  Hubby's ribs were fatty, not dry as others have mentioned.    An employee approached us to ask if everything was \"OK\" - I told her that I was disappointed that they were out of chicken breast, and she said \"can I get you another one\"...keep in mind that all I had was a paper cup I was eating mashed potatoes out of, there was no plate with a chicken breast meal on it in front of me, so I asked if they DID have chicken breast available, and she kind of laughed and said she wasn't sure....at that moment I was wondering if I was on Candid Camera or something!!  I would think that management tells the staff what they do and do not have, but whatever.  I watched as another employee wandered the room yelling out \"697\", \"697\" over and over again, looking for the people who apparently had paid for their order but were nowhere to be found.  I saw her take the order back to the kitchen, and then order \"698\" came out...  This location has been open for almost a year, not a few days - I am not impressed with the management, in fact I did not see anyone who appeared to be \"in charge\". What I did see was a Boston Market nearby, I should have gone there, brought back some chicken and sat with my hubby - I doubt that any of the Old Carolina staff would have noticed!!  Note to management- I have worked in restaurants before and I understand that sometimes you sell out of things sooner than expected.  If an employee would have told us while waiting in line what your location was out of, I could have made a more informed choice, or chosen to go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Straight forward BBQ place. Overall it was good experience. Pulled pork was cooked perfectly and I like all the options of sides. Hush puppies were my favorite and gotta love the sweet tea and all the BBQ sauce choices. Mac and cheese is cheesy and green beans are cooked with brisket. It was very clean and the staff was friendly and walking around to all the tables. Overall a great experience."}
{"text":"Pretty damn good for a BBQ chain and quite honestly this is the best you're going to get in CLE. That is not an exaggeration. CLE has no other BBQ joint that is as good as Old Carolina. Sad truth.  The pulled pork is delicious.   The sauces they offer are all fantastic too.   Real hush puppies!!! So good.  Even the baked beans are a hit.  You should go here cuz if you haven't you're missing out."}
{"text":"Ordered a slab of ribs to take home with cole slaw(creamy). They were having a special because of the holiday , it was my first time to try their food and I was pleasantly  surprised at the quality of the ribs I received. The creamy cole slaw was not very creamy and needed more dressing although it was better than most."}
{"text":"The food is awesome. Best cue on East side of Cleveland, I would highly suggest you try it out if you like good cue."}
{"text":"Amazing good food large helpings and great service. We will definitely be back . The special was a great deal at under $10."}
{"text":"Old Carolina, a great place for lunch if you want that Southern style of barbecue.   The people are some of the kindest also. I can see a return to this restaurant in the near future.  Good job"}
{"text":"Where do I start? True Carolina BBQ! I knew they were authentic form the moment I saw the Cheerwine sign! Anyone that knows Carolina BBQ, knows that it varies by region and they do a great job of offering a selection of sauces to cater to ever taste. They do a great job of delivering Carolina BBQ."}
{"text":"This is good stuff!   I was pleasantly surprised.   I ordered the combo, which included 3 meats and 2 sides,  I added a pint of coleslaw.   This was more than adequate to feed my family of 3 people.   My combo included 4 ribs, beef brisket and chicken tenders.   I chose 2 orders of handcut fries, as my sides.   The side order of fries was HUGE, enough to fill an 8x8 styrofoam takeout containers.  This was a take-out order.   I arrived home roughly 15 minutes later, everything was still hot and fresh.  The ribs and brisket were well seasoned and very tender.  I opted for 2 different sauces (served on the side), the signature sweet sauce and the spicy.  Both were very tasty on the meat and the fries.   I will definitely return to Old Carolina BBQ!"}
{"text":"We had high expectations, but we're very disappointed. We had both ribs and chicken, and both were way over cooked and dry. The selection of sauces is ok but tastes like they bought it at a grocery store.  Everything was what you would expect of a chain. Yuck. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Staff was over the top friendly. It felt like everyone was the owner and everyone was smiling.   Food was BOMB. sauces were BOMB.Gold sauce is my favorite. Will definitely come again!"}
{"text":"Great bbq and sauce selection. Good for families and not very expensive for bbq. The employees were friendly and courteous. You order at a counter but they bring it to you."}
{"text":"My copilot found this spot here on Yelp. Arrived and realized its a chain decided how bad could it really be? First mistake.  At the counter I order the two meat plate, first meat pork and then am informed it's an extra buck for brisket. I figure sure I'll have the brisket. Second mistake. Food shows up and it looks meh. Pork is just ok. brisket is visibly dry and looks a lil like jerky it's inedible one bite and I'm all set. Really a buck for this hot garbage? Mac and cheese was uneventful and the vinegar slaw was inedible like the brisket. The corn bread muffin was the best part. The banana pudding was pretty bad also. Never again."}
{"text":"Delicous! Clean place. Friendly service. Wish I knew about this place years ago!! The cole slaw was OK but the ribs were on point. I would try a different side next time."}
{"text":"I been here 3 times and it deserves 3 stars it's very average. The only thing I actually liked are the ribs, hush puppies and fries. The pulled pork was not very good, the sand which buns are cheap, BBQ sauce is average just nothing that stands out for my business. I wish it was better b/c I live in stow but rarely eat at any establishments here because frankly they aren't good. I rather spend a little more and going to better sit down BBQ places in Hudson or Akron which has much better options and quality is far superior to Carolina BBQ"}
{"text":"Really good, but not what most Ohioans consider BBQ.  Okay, hickory smoked pork is a little different in an awesome way.  They have Ribs, Pulled pork, Beef Brisket, Chicken, Turkey as main menu.  A good assortment of side, too.  If you like a real treat get the Cheerwine (cherry soda - northern translation), you have to drive about 6 hours South on I77 to get it anywhere else.  I went straight into a combo with pulled pork and ribs, baked beans, and 4 cheese mac & cheese.  The ribs (only 4 in combo) were really well flavored without sauce.  The pulled pork needs sauce, it was a little dry.  The sauces were pretty flavorful piedmont #5 is nice mix of tomato based and vinegar based sauces (on pulled pork apply liberally - even in Strongsville the G H W Bush clock tower will never know).  The classsic and coastal carolina were good on ribs.  The baked beans are a three bean mix with probably coastal carloina sauce and a little pulled pork to add smoky flavor.  The mac & cheese is best left for people like a little cheese flavor with mac part. Better choices would be cole slaw (they have creamy and vinegar) and fresh cut fries with skins on. Portions of food and sides are good.  My visit was on Wednesday about 4pm, and the place has about 20 some tables.  I would think you will wait to eat at peak times.  They do take out."}
{"text":"Pretty good! Wish the portions were bigger for the calabash platter I got. I had two pieces of fish, maybe 2-3\" in size each and a handful of shrimp. The hush puppies and two sides made up for this. The Mac and cheese is amazing.. so we're the fries. Definitely a must visit."}
{"text":"After a full day, we we're looking for a place along Mayfield Rd. to sit down, eat and relax with the family. My wife reminded me that this place just opened. We always like to try new places, and we weren't disappointed. It was a relaxed and laid back atmosphere where you order your food at the counter and their staff brings it to your table when ready. The staff was very friendly, helpful and very accommodating. We had the family meal with ribs, chicken, brisket, mashed potatoes, mac n cheese, and green beans. The ribs were excellent and the garlic mashed potatoes were awesome. Actually, everything was very good. If I had to be picky, I'd say that the brisket was not as juicy as I would've liked, but it was still good. The kids loved everything. Their prices are very reasonable. I'll definitely recommend this place in a heartbeat for anyone who enjoys a southern style meal. We'll definitely be back many more times."}
{"text":"Ordering is slow, but the food comes out quickly.  It's warm, but not microwave hot.  The pulled pork taste like pork.  Good combination of lean and fatty bits.  Decent smoke ring on pieces with bark.  Eat it plain, good and moist by itself, or sauce it up with a variety of sauces or vinegar baste.  The Mac and cheese was average at best.  I'll try something else next time."}
{"text":"Great quick food option. Pulled pork and brisket was good. Loved the baked beans."}
{"text":"I have spent summers in North Carolina and winters in South Carolina. In the Carolinas barbecue means what is known rather sordidly as pulled pork elsewhere. Pork ribs are the only other meat at barbecue stands. On every table is a plastic pitcher of sweetened iced tea. These places are all over and usually have their own following but in truth most are similar offering excellent barbecue and ribs.  Over the past few years I have seen the founders of Old Carolina interviewed and watched their Canton restaurant branch to Akron and now to Cleveland. Friends of mine living near the newly opened Lyndhurst location suggested I join them yesterday at Old Carolina.  In my travels West I have acquired an appreciation of barbecued brisket, turkey and sausage. Old Carolina goes beyond Carolina tradition and offers brisket and turkey. Oddly being located in the undisputed USA sausage capital it does not offer sausage.   I ordered the combo plate with turkey and brisket. For sides I had mac and cheese and Brunswick stew. Rather than corn bread Old Carolina places a commercially made inedible soft roll on the plate. Every thing on my paper lined metal tray was a letdown. The brisket was well smoked but was so streaked with fat it resembled pork belly. The turkey had a processed texture and was dry. The Brunswick stew was canned tomatoes with shreds of pork and beef. The mac and cheese was not the rich concoction of the Carolinas made with milk, cheese and eggs but a pale and flavorless pasta. Portions were conspicuously small. I had Cheerwine soda which the owners claim accompanies barbecue in the Carolinas, but I rarely see it there and even in local grocery stores very little shelf space is given to Cheerwine. Iced tea is the table wine.   One of my companions had the boneless skinless chicken breast which can not be good anywhere, but his wife had the ribs which she said were a bit better than average. My dinner came to $17 and no where worth what that amount can buy elsewhere.   The servers are a bit too attentive. The place is spacious and clean. Deserving of three stars at most but a demerit for over pricing. Ray Rays remains the best barbecue in Cleveland despite it being a food truck in Columbus."}
{"text":"This place is REALLY GOOD!  Whenever our family is in the mood for BBQ, this is where we go.  The staff is pleasant and helpful, the food is delicious, the restrooms are clean and the atmosphere is decent."}
{"text":"Listen, you are not going to be getting true southern style BBQ up here so make sure to manage your expectations. What you will get is a premium franchise with a great attempt at southern BBQ.   The meat inst going to be awesome as you are not paying like a real BBQ place. For 20 bucks I got the ultimate sampler and a crazy amount of food to try. Of course there is going to be sacrifice. Have I had better ribs else where? Sure, but this place did a pretty good job and I didn't bust the bank doing so.   I always caution myself when trying a new place. Not every restaurant is a 5 star masterpieces and they don't want to be. These guys are a great middle of the road place with a great attempt at mass producing real BBQ. Factor in the price and this place is great! Good variety and the smokey tastes are good. Yes, the meat isn't grade A but its good and the sauces are legit.   I will come back here for sure. Try the fritters and the bulled pork. Two of the best at this place. the turkey is also really good too. Don't over look it!"}
{"text":"I love barbecue.  Been lucky enough to travel the southeast US, and enjoy some fine, fine stuff.  This place is for real. Quality smoked meats. Would route move, but my fingers are a tad greasy.  Sides here are ok, but that's not the attraction.  Go, get your 'Q on."}
{"text":"Cleveland is seriously lacking good BBQ. This place is very average. It's northern style BBQ!  I'd stick with the pulled pork here. They have several bottled sauces to help yourself to, but they are all too sweet. I liked the mustard and the vinegar sauces best.   Service is pretty slow but nice. The day we came in for lunch, there were only 2 ladies working. They were doing a good job of trying to get everyone taken care of."}
{"text":"This is BBQ in the north. Overall my experience here wasn't bad but the meats were definitely not what I was hoping for.   I had the double meat plate for $11.99 (Plus $1 up charge for some meats) which seemed to be the best deal on the menu. I tried pulled pork and wings, with sides of green beans and creamy coleslaw. The plate also came with a tiny cornbread and cinnamon butter. It was great to have plenty of BBQ sauce available near the drink station, but none of the sauces were good. The sauces, ok, I didn't care for them but that could be a personal preference. The chicken wings were good. They didn't taste smoked, but they had a salty dry rub that was tasty. The pulled pork was the biggest disappointment on the platter. It was mostly burnt ends that were too tough to chew, and shaved up pieces of pork mixed with fat - there were no solid chunks of tender pulled pork like you get at real southern BBQ places. So, maybe it was an off- day for the pork. But I tried the turkey and brisket off my family's plates and both were tough and the turkey was way too salty. The brisket was half fat and the rest rubber.   The side dishes were okay at best. Creamy coleslaw was good. Green beans were WAY too artificially green. They were almost neon green! Something wasn't right. The Mac and Cheese was tasty.   Since there isn't really much BBQ competition in Cleveland, sadly this may be one of the only places to get it if you're craving it. I will wait until I'm back in the south to have  any more BBQ."}
{"text":"First time here, thought I would try it out since I love barbecue. I thought it was kind of pricey for fast food barbecue. You order at the counter and they bring it to your seat. They also take your trash away when you leave. I think they should change the business and have waiters. For the price you pay they should wait on you. Food was pretty decent. You definitely need to put sauce on everything. I would come back."}
{"text":"This place is becoming one of our go to restaurants. Try the cornbread, it's served with an addictive sweet butter. We also love the pulled pork sandwich and fries. Service is always friendly and we never wait too long for our food. I've had better barbecue, but for the price and convenience, I'd choose this place over others in the area every time."}
{"text":"Love this BBQ spot! The food and atmosphere remind us of our home in NC where we lived for ten years.  Service is quick, staff is friendly, and the BBQ is authentic carolina style smoked to perfection.  Their sauce selection has a good variety from mustard base to spicy tomato.   Best part...you can buy Cheerwine there! Definitely a go-to quick bite of BBQ. Prices are reasonable (8-16$/plate) and they offer a good selection of meats including brisket and ribs. The hot dogs are good too!"}
{"text":"BBQ traveler, I've done road trips based on BBQ , so I've had my share of BBQ throughout this great land, especially though the BBQ belt. Most  meals for me, south of the Mason Dixon Line are BBQ. With that said, here is my personal take and taste of Old Carolina Barbecue Company. Keeping in mind everyone has different likes and tastes based on many different factors. I entered the restaurant with great anticipation with the great smell of smoke permeating the room. I ordered the Ultimate Sampler Combo  plate , with a sampling of five of their meats. When the plate arrived I was overwhelmed by the size, it could possibly be enough for two  to share and a good value for the money. Here is a quick rundown of my own personal opinion of the meats that I received. Starting with my least favorite the pull chicken or what I would like to call chicken jerky, bone dry almost uneatable without BBQ sauce. Maybe I just hit them at the wrong time on that one. Next the ribs, probably the only meat that had that great smoked flavor that I crave, but boy they where some fatty ribs. The brisket, had a nice smoke ring, but lack a good smoky flavor and tasted like a roasted brisket, not bad , but nothing special about it either. Then there was the large, thick slice turkey, there again not bad , but nothing special about it either except for the nice large slices of turkey. Last but not least the pulled pork, for me probably the best meat of the bunch. Being a Carolina BBQ restaurant, if they didn't get this right, I totally would have been disappointed with the meal. The pork was tender and juicy and was the highlight of all the meats. The sides of fresh cut fries where a very large portion and well seasoned, probably may favorite thing about this meal. I always like to order fries at BBQ joints so I have something to dip into the BBQ sauces. Another thing that did not hit the mark for my personal taste where the BBQ sauces, and I mean all of them, not one of them would I recommend, but if I had to chose one, I'd go with the Coastal Spiced Vinegar that is already on the table. I also had a side of baked beans, more like a Texas style cowboy bean dish, made with several different beans some bits of meat scraps and heavily seasoned with cumin. Oh and I almost forgot about the unassuming small corn muffin served with the dish that I'll call a \"plate filler\". The best part of this place is the large portion for the money. Even though I would rate this place Average at best, and with the lack of exceptional BBQ in the Cleveland area, I will give this place another try, perhaps sticking with the pulled pork and a Cheerwine a Carolina favorite."}
{"text":"First time here! Service was friendly and relatively fast. The food was okay! Not the best pulled pork I've ever had but adequate. Tables were sticky!"}
{"text":"Uninspiring decor so we opted to take out. Admittedly we stopped before heading home after driving 500 miles in an ice storm for half the trip. Tired? Yes. Hungry? Definitely.   Two of us split a sampler with 2 sides. While the ribs and pulled pork were okay, I did enjoy the brisket. Very tasty. I liked the mustardy gold sauce. The hot BBQ sauce was just okay. I'll give it credit for at least being hot without an extract flavor that just kills many hot sauces. The vinegar slaw was good and the other side was so memorable that I can't remember what it was. Mashed potatoes maybe?   Pet peeve of mine: serving uninspiring bread. I'm never sure why places provide such pedestrian rolls. They're cheap, not hard to make and add so much. Yes, they had the obligatory meh roll. Too bad.  I'll give positive marks to the cashier. Though her perkiness bordered on equaling the daughter from The Middle, she was very friendly and offered advice.  Seemed a bit pricey for what we got. If I go again, I'll just get the brisket."}
{"text":"Lets start by saying we will go back. The best part of the meal was the smoked turkey. Very moist and tasty. The brisket and pulled pork were very good. Coleslaw and pulled chicken were good along with the selection of BBQ Sauces and spicy French fries.  The not so good, Mac & cheese and the beans."}
{"text":"If you are an elderly person who can only eat bland food, or if you lost all of your taste buds in a freak accident, or if you are sheltered and prefer to stick with the comfort of chain restaurants, then Old Carolina is for you!  If you care at all about putting tasty flavorful food in your mouth then I have to recommend you go elsewhere for your BBQ needs. There are a ton of local places you can patronize like Proper Pig, Woodstock, Mabel's, Barabicu Smokehouse, Oak & Embers... heck you could even check out Mission BBQ if you want to stick with a chain.   Okay, here is my experience:   I think I went to Old Carolina once maybe ten years ago so when they opened up a location close to me I decided to give them a try. I stopped in on a Saturday evening and the place was pretty steady with customers. The young man at the register was friendly and helpful. My to-go order wait was not too long. I went with The Ultimate Sampler Combo which is a tasting of 5 meats, two sides, and one cornbread for $19.99, I also added two extra sides for $3.69. Not a bad price it seemed. I was looking forward to my meal and hoping it would be good so I could be lazy and not drive far the next time I wanted BBQ.   But then I started eating the food and things took a turn for the disappointing. They were out of the brisket so I got extra ribs, no big deal it was late in the evening I understand stuff runs out. But the ribs were so dry! It was like they had been sitting in a warming tray for hours. Lots of dried up meat and hard bark that went in the trash. For sides, oh man, just everything was mediocre. Mac & cheese was bland, same with the boring mashed potatoes. The baked beans had flavor, but like eating a cup of chili with a ton of chili seasoning. Was not expecting that compared with everything else. The small cornbread muffin was nothing to write home about.   Now I did like the variety of sauces, and the creamy coleslaw was standard but it did it's job. The pulled pork and pulled chicken were good if you ate them right away, just not that moist so when reheated they dried up. No complaints about the chicken wings.   Nothing was terrible, but it was lackluster. I seriously contemplated throwing out my leftovers because the food was so meh it wasn't worth eating. But I thought I might have been too harsh so I had it all again the next day. Still mediocre.   I don't know, everyone is different so maybe you will love this place, but I honestly think if you have ever experienced great BBQ you will be just as disappointed as me with Old Carolina."}
{"text":"Old Carolina is one of those places that I have on my list that will do \"in a pinch.\" My son absolutely loves it, so I go there at least once a month if not more.   With a wide array of BBQ offerings, you're likely to find something that suits your fancy, from pulled pork to ribs, from brisket to chicken; they even have hot dogs. Old Carolina also have a nice selection (4 if I recall) of BBQ sauces from sweet and tangy to Carolina mustard, to spicy, but not too spicy to compliment your meal. Their selections of sides are all pretty good too.   The last few times I've been there though, they've been \"out\" of the protein that I ordered; ribs once, and chicken the other. It's not a big deal, but something that I would expect to be addressed. Once forgiven, twice forgotten.   For fast food style BBQ, Old Carolina is pretty good; maybe the best (around here at least). It's not going to knock your socks off, but i think you'll agree that \"it'll do in a pinch.\""}
{"text":"My people had this appetite for bbq ribs since two days. The original idea: make it yourself, got thrown-out since we are busy busy busy. So we literally looked up on YELP which might be a good alternative DIY. We were about to order from OPEN PIT, but it's a take-out only and we didn't want to sit at home with the food after all, so we came here. I am glad we did! We had each a full order ribs with coleslaw and 1 portion chicken fingers with french fries and we ate it all.  Not only was the food delicious, it also did not have the plastic-atmosphere of a chain restaurant.  Very comfortable, because spacious, light wooden hall, with plenty of room to choose where you want to sit.  Waitress came to us to ask if we liked it during the meal and even the chef came after we had finished, yes of course we liked it, it was wonderful! (Even the bathrooms here are clean and spacious. Don't laugh, that IS important if you want 5**!) If I would change anything it would be adding a tip option on the bills, because in a plastic money world as is staff may loose out on a tip I would be happy to give.  This time I carried some crumpled up $$, so we're all good."}
{"text":"First time i visited this restaurant, i ordered pulled pork sandwich and fries. Sandwich was good and tender. i chose classic bbq sauce.  A few months had passed and i tried the ribs--will not order again. ribs had a dry taste, look and texture. I sampled the mac and cheese and baked beans. Mac cheese had no taste, and the taste of baked  beans was so so, but i was not a fan of having kidney beans in my baked beans; they were not tender enough.    Forgot to mentioned that i tried the fried doughnuts during first visit and they were delicious."}
{"text":"Food was very good, we been 2 a lot of different old Carolina and this has 2 be my favorite. Fries very fresh and all the food was fresh and good. Customer service was good as well. So if looking for some good BBQ this is a good place"}
{"text":"Genuinely southern! I will absolutely be going back.   They have a great selection of high quality meats including pulled pork, ribs, brisket, chicken, turkey, and wings.   Their sides are incredible and include Mac n cheese, hushpuppies, slaw, and cornbread muffins.   They have tons of different BBQ sauces that are represented by different part of the Carolinas. They also have cheerwine! I haven't seen that since I lived down south!  Overall, very filling, good price and lots of high quality BBQ!"}
{"text":"Some tips for these guys. Offer each meat individually. Include smoked sausage, including jelopeno sausage.  Cook your pork ribs a bit longer, they are too tough on the bone.  Beans are ok but try Fudrukers beans and move in that direction.  OC has a way to go to be on par with the likes of better chains like Smokey Bones."}
{"text":"Ordered food online Saturday January 16 and went to pick it up.  The cashier who was this teenage boy ignored me as I stood there for ten minutes.  Didn't look at me once, didn't say one word and I was about 5 feet away from him. It was not busy at all.  He actually helped a girl who came in after me before me. And I could not understand if he was just slow mentally or just a complete jackass who has no clue about how to do his simple job.  Well it's the latter of the two. I finally said hey I've been standing her for ten minutes can you help me? And he just looked at me and said nothing and walked off as another worker helped me.  I ordered $70 worth of food and they gave it to me for free because that is one the worst experiences I've had picking up food from a restaurant. Ribs were no big deal either. Will not go back there.  I gave it two stars because and only because the food was free."}
{"text":"Wife and I had the 3 mini sand. pulled pork pulled chic, brisket and FRIED chicken. All were great. Tried all sauces except honey mustard. All were good but couldn't use too much of the screamin beaver. Good creamy slaw and tons of fries. Great service. Were will go back."}
{"text":"It's not easy to find good BBQ in Cleveland, let alone the east side... but this place is pretty good. At this point I've had a little bit of everything on the menu and I highly recommend the brisket and pulled pork. The hand rolled hush puppies are a must, they are the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"I am a BBQ snob. I smoke my own meats and have high expectations.   This place is that good.  Everything is good.   All meats sides.  Very impressed.  And I will be back."}
{"text":"I've only had their food when it's catered, but I've been impressed both times I've had it! The meat is tender, the baked beans are great without being too sweet."}
{"text":"Not a fan! The Mac and cheese sucks bland as hell. I asked for the hottest sauce.... Wasn't put in my bag. Got all the way to work and they forgot my banana pudding. Went back to get my sauce and pudding. Then got back to work and realized they forgot my cole slaw. Not to mention my ribs were dry af!! Won't ever be going back!!!"}
{"text":"I got the pulled pork sandwich and put the screaming beaver sauce in it. Let me tell you it was the best pork I have had at a restaurant. Fall off the bone juicy goodness!  The screening beaver sauce is a must have as well if your a spicy fan!"}
{"text":"we ordered 100.00 worth of bbq delevered. ribs chicken both 1/4 and pulled. brisket as well. mac n cheese, beans, green beans. i dont have anything good to say about any of it. AND they didnt send sauce. WTF?  Dont waste your money here."}
{"text":"This was our first and only visit to the stow location. We went there to give it a try before we hired them to cater my stepdaughters wedding. I have had all good experiences at the Akron location but tonight was discusting. We waited about 7 min to order even though there was only one couple in front of us, when we did order the girl running the cash register was rude and Had an attitude. Where you wait for your food they have a window looking in the kitchen and it was a mess. The window itself and the sill had chunks of meat on them they had trash and dirty pans all over. It looked like it hadn't been swept or mopped in days.  Then the couple in front of us complained that the cash register girl with the attitude was handeling their food without gloves on and the guy just said to her and I quote \"if your overly sensitive about that we can make your order again or just give it to you for free\". Now to the food we got the meal that has ribs, pulled chicken, pulled pork, wings, and brisket. Everything was cold the pork and wings tasted good but both were over cooked and dry. The ribs were mainly fat, the brisket tasted good but was also cold and the shredded chicken again had good flavor but was over cooked and cold. The cornbread was good but I was surprised to see them scoop out the honey butter from a huge unrefridgerated tub on the counter (without gloves on). The worst part is the disappointment that we thought we found a caterer for the wedding and now we have to be on the hunt again."}
{"text":"I think I am done with Old Carolina. The Calabash seafood season just ended, and only once was it as good as previous years. Overcooked and rubbery shrimp every time. Today clinched my being done with this restaurant. As long as they have been in business, they have used the cheapest, lowest quality sandwich buns available. I wouldn't be surprised if they got them at the Nickle's store where you can get old bread cheap. The bun cannot stand up to the weight of the meat even when fresh, but if it is old, the bread crumbles and disintegrates in your hand. I paid about $11 for the pulled pork sandwich, fries, and a drink, so we're not talking a cheap lunch. I can't be the only customer bothered by this. Maybe that's why they are rarely busy."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our lunch and will come back. However, my husband's ribs were suspiciously uniform for an authentic rib joint and only \"just ok\". My pulled pork sandwich was very good and all of the sides were excellent (between us we had mac and cheese, hush puppies, vinegar coleslaw, and baked beans). I think it was pricey, but no more so than other midrange restaurants."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place.  The food is excellent with the right amount of smokiness.  I ordered 1/3 slab of ribs which were really tasty. You have a choice of about 6 different sauces you can add.  I had a side of mac and cheese with it which was just as good as homemade.  The rest of our party ordered the 3 slider combo, chicken fingers, and pulled pork.  No complaints at all.  The smoked chicken wings are very good also."}
{"text":"Very tasty. I ordered pulled pork. I was pleased that the meat was lean and not fatty. My sig oth ordered pulled chicken and was pleased at the generous portion. I was surprised that the chicken was all white meat. I wasn't mad. Usually with pulled chicken you get just as much dark meat if not more; usually cloaked with a copious amount of sauce.  The meat comes dry so you have the choice of sweet, mildish and hot sauces along with a vinegar based Carolina style sauce table side. Tried the sweet and hot sauces. Initially, I wasn't blown away but when paired with the various meats, I found them to be a fine compliment. Will try the midline sauce next time. We got fries, (which were quite peppery and reminded me of my grandmas home fries) onion strings which were a tad bit greasy but very tasty and macaroni and cheese. I didn't care for the Mac and cheese as I found it to be a little 'rich' for my tastes. I had Cheerwine complete the Carolina theme. Overall, I enjoyed my selections and find myself looking forward to trying them again in the near future. The ribs and the brisket will be next on the menu along with a little more of what I enjoyed on my first visit. Pricing was fair considering what you get. Definitely reasonable. A positive experience."}
{"text":"Every time I've come here I've been pleasantly surprised.  The ribs are tender and full of flavor even without any sauce. The chicken and the brisket are also very good. The fries are fresh cut but I'd recommend you split them it is a plate full. My favorite offering here ( not for everyone ) is the banana pudding, no it's not world changing but so few places offer it and it seems to go really well after the food. The only negative ill aya is the BBQ sauces seem to be a bit underwhelming. Not really a fast food joint in price but food comes out pretty fast. And cherry pop mmmmmm !"}
{"text":"I live in South Carolina, so bbq is definitely on top of my list for favorite food.  Having said that, I was really looking forward to trying this place out while in town for work training.  I ordered the two meat/two sides plate and got brisket and pulled pork with mac and cheese and hush puppies.  Brisket was pretty tasty, but the rest was underwhelming.  Pork was borderline mushy (think grocery store quality), mac was watery and had little flavor, and the hush puppies were just ok.  Where my disappointment was greatest, however, was the selection/flavor of bbq sauces.  They were supposedly inspired by certain bbq sauces in the south, but I can assure you I've never had anything like them.  The mustard-based was the best of the worst, and I generally am not a fan of this style.    Staff had the southern hospitality thing going and it certainly smelled appealing upon arrival, but that's where the similarities ended unfortunately.  Perhaps my expectations were too high, but I left disappointed."}
{"text":"The food here has apparently gotten much better with time and experience. This was our first visit we were impressed. I had the rib and beef brisket combo with vinegar cole slaw and fresh fries as my sides. My wife had the pulled pork sandwich with the 4 cheese blend Mac and cheese. The food came out at the right temperature. The ribs were meaty and moist with just the right amount of smoke flavor. The beef brisket was moist and not fatty with a nice smokiness to it. I tried 2 different sauces and the seasoned vinegar. They have a thin consistency and absorbed well into the meats and we're good with the fries too. The slaw had just the right amount of vinegar flavor. Clearly they followed the vinegar theme used in parts of the Carolina's.  My wife's pulled pork was good with the sweet sauce. She really enjoyed the Mac and cheese. The portions were large and priced well. We had the banana pudding for desert and it was good as well.  We tried the Cheer Wine and it was as good as we remembered. The sweet tea was my choice and it was better than McDonald's!   We spent 15 years on the other side of the Mason-Dixon Line and the BBQ here was as good as we got down there. The service was great for a self service restaurant. The Manager and 2 staff members stopped by our table to ask how everything was and whether we needed anything. We will return and likely bring our grand kids. They will love the Mac and cheese and the other kid friendly menu items. The shame is that they were not very busy around 7pm when we were their for dinner."}
{"text":"Enjoy eating here, it's really good. Would not go as far as to say great and it's a little on the pricey side. My favorite thing after the ribs is the Cherrywine Soda, I only drink pop once or twice a year, but this stuff is addictive! BBQ is incredibly subjective and I fully understand what I love others might not and vice versa. Not a big fan of vinegary sauces, but again I could be the minority. Sides are ok, but come for the meat! Great dining experience, nice place, won't probably get out too cheap, but would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Four+ stars. Had the \"Two Meat Platter\" with brisket and pulled chicken. Also ate one of my fiancee's mini pulled pork sandwiches. All were excellent, especially the brisket which was really tender. Enjoyed all the sauces. Vinegar coleslaw was very good as was the cornbread. Looking forward to a return trip, only reason didn't score it 5 stars is that I feel it's slightly overpriced, given the mostly self-serve atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is a great addition to Stow. I have been here 2 or 3 times now and have tried a few different things. My husband really likes the ribs and the brisket and I think the pulled pork is wonderful. The sides are quality as well, but to be honest I think the star here is the meat and sauce. Oh the sauce. I love the vinegar based BBQ sauce and if you do too, you will really like it here. They have a station with about 5 different kinds and they are all great. It's set up so the line moves quickly, I guess I think it's a little pricey which is why we don't go here more but you definitely get your money's worth on flavor and quantity. If your looking for great BBQ go here and I promise you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Really fantastic pulled pork. Born and raised in NC and a true BBQ snob!  Great spot and great service."}
{"text":"Old Carolina BBQ was something we decided to try one Friday night instead of hitting up another pizza place, and were glad we did! My parents got a huge sampler while I went with the pulled pork and ribs.  The ribs were good, but the star of the meal was definitely the pulled pork. It was great, and trying it with all of the different sauces they offer made it even better. It is more expensive than I thought it would be, but he quality of the food made it worth it."}
{"text":"Stopped in during business trip to Cleveland and loved this place. Really good BBQ, beans and hush puppies.  The pork Q is not exactly Lexington style vinegar based Q, but I really liked the Ohio version.  Slow roasted turkey was excellent and healthy option.  Not healthy, but oh so good hushpuppys.  Such a simple side, but most places outside the Carolinas just don't get it right.  The beans were delicious but definitely not vegan as they had pork mixed in.    The staff really seemed to like working at this restaurant and proud of what they do.  It showed.    For the price, $20 for two, five stars!  *Born in NC, many years in VA and living in Texas so I guess that somehow makes me an expert on BBQ?"}
{"text":"BBQ that's just above fast food quality.  it's good for what it is."}
{"text":"I have ate here before and it was good. This time, I tried their smokehouse wings, and they were good, not great but good.  The fries were better than I thought they would be. If you are looking for fast, cheap BBQ, then give this place a try. There are better BBQ joints in the Cleveland Area, but this one had pretty fast service. They  are fairly priced but the ribs are cheap compared to other BBQ places. They have about 4 sauces, I liked the sweet and tangy one. They have Cheery-wine, which I know is huge in the south! Again, not the best, but decent."}
{"text":"I've ordered a few different items from Old Carolina, but the half chicken is my favorite. The barbecue sauce options are pretty good too."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure what to expect.  A BBQ place in a strip mall.  Ok so I went in.  I ordered the turkey and chicken wings. The wings were amazing.  The turkey not so much.  Very dried out.  Ohh well.  The soda was over carbonated.  Four stars is all I can offer."}
{"text":"The beef brisket was delicious!  They had 4 types of BBQ sauce to try - my favorite was the Piedmont No. 5.  My husband's favorite was the Original Classic.  However, we didn't even need the BBQ sauce for the brisket, it was so tender.    We weren't as fond of the coleslaw.  You can either order the Creamy Coleslaw or the Vinegar Coleslaw.  We would've like to see a combination of the two.  I also tried the macaroni and cheese - it was pretty good, but I didn't like the bread crumbles on top.    Next time we have an opportunity to eat at Old Carolina BBQ, I will try some of the other side items...and will probably stick to ordering the beef brisket again!"}
{"text":"Let's start with the excellent stuff.  The sauces are super tasty.  I love the spicy-savory sauce, particularly. I was looking for random things I could pour their sauces on.  One thing I poured it on was their hushpuppies - sausage-shaped bits of fried cornbread that were moist and flavorful.  That was the problem, though - they had an overwhelmingly oniony overtone, and though I loved the cornbread itself, that flavor would hit you, then you'd enjoy the moist cornbread, and then the onion aftertaste would hit your tongue like an angry, bitter truck.  If you happen to love onion, I think you'll love the hushpuppies, but not I.  The Mac and cheese was flavorless to me - it tasted like a starter sauce that hadn't had the cheese added into it.  I was expecting better, it looks beautiful, but it didn't speak to me.  The pulled pork was cooked very well, moist and all... but if it saw \"14 hours\" of smoking, I will eat my nonexistent hat. A 12-year-old behind the schoolhouse has seen more smoke than that pork.  And the same goes for my wife's brisket.  Wasn't bad, it was just... forgettable.  They DO have cheerwine, the cherry-flavored pop from the south that is super tasty, and if you like it you can buy it by the case.  I think they rely on their sauces to save them, and as such, my pulled pork sandwich was fine.  But fine doesn't make me crave it.  If I want mediocre, I'll order a pizza."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time. We ordered two kids meals, 2 with Mac and cheese and one with fries, and two of the two meat plates. It took 30 minutes, I'm not exaggerating, for our food to come out, when there was one person waiting for food when we arrived. When the food finally arrived there were no fries, and we were told \"apparently our cooks are incompetent, I'll get your fries\", we also noticed we were given pulled pork when we ordered pulled chicken, but we figured we'd wait until they came back with the fries to let them know. 25 minutes passed and no one has come back with the fries. We finally spoke to a manager and our meal was refunded with \"we are doing the best we can\" and nothing else.   The food we did get was very ok, not worth the hassle in any way."}
{"text":"I don't always review chains like this, but the smoked 1/2 chicken was so good, that I just had to. The meat was super moist, seasoned well and had just the right amount of smoke to it. I was in heaven. It comes with a cornbread muffin and was $8.99.   The brisket and pulled pork are fine. Pretty standard I guess.  If you only pick one side, go with the hush-puppies. They're delicious, and you get 6 of them, and they're very large.  I wasn't as big a fan of the mac and cheese as I was the hush puppies, but it was okay."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a while, wife wanted a pulled pork sandwich which we were in the neighborhood reminded her about this place, was good the first time we went but this time food was just ok, the smell/visual was great butt the taste was lack luster.          We ordered the rib platter with brisket our sides were fries/hush puppies & a pulled pork sandwich came out to roughly $24-, the fries were heavily seasoned with salt/coarse black pepper [inedible], brisket was dry, ribs was fine [meaty], hush puppies were great & the pulled pork sandwich was just mediocre. The best part of the meal we got free drinks..."}
{"text":"Mea culpa.....haven't been here for months as I felt the sauces and seasonings weren't to my taste. Last night my ribs were very tasty and the brisket was tender and flavorful, the sauces were brought to another level and fulfilled my taste buds demands. Do give them a try as it is well worth it. You will find me there!"}
{"text":"SUPER TASTY! Good place to get that BBQ fix satisfied! Came here with friends from out of town and really enjoyed the laid back casual atmosphere and neighborly staff.  As newbies, our drink was on the house and the food was fast to be delivered.  Prices are as friendly as the company!"}
{"text":"Do you want to serve BBQ at your wedding? Hire these guys! Overall quality at a completely reasonable price. The coordinator, Brooke, takes care of everything and has a personality that makes you feel like an old friend. (Super helpful when planning a wedding remotely.) Even helped us rent bar equipment and linens for a venue where we had to bring everything in ourselves. Several guests told us it was the best food they've ever had at a wedding. Rave reviews about the pulled pork and green beans in particular. (And who ever raves about green beans served to a large group of people?!) The venue was about 50 miles from their home base yet everything was fresh, hot, and not overcooked."}
{"text":"Carolina has the best barbecue in Cleveland.  I would not have given 5 stars but considering the blabbering of Ka*in on and on about herself I thought the place needed a lift. I don't know why some people who don't like the restaurant's specialty see fit to trash a place.  Her review is useless!. Fries are very good, fresh cut.  And the ribs can be enjoyed without sauce.  As far as sauces the original is good.  Smoked turkey is OK.  My wife enjoyed the pulled pork, which is among the best she has had."}
{"text":"Never been disappointed here. The beans are always fantastic, seasoned with pulled pork and great sauce.  Firm beans and never mushy or over-cooked. The four mini-sandwich special is a nice way to sample a variety of meat. My wife's chicken was superb, from the bite she gave me. If you are going to eat French fries, the might as well be really good ones. Ours were very fresh and tasty. The service was fantastic. Quick, delicious, well prepared and reasonably priced. BRAVO!"}
{"text":"The boyfriend and I have been talking about checking out this place for awhile. I'm always craving BBQ, so when he suggested we get lunch yesterday, I was totally down.   First off, you can smell it from the parking lot. For once, that's a good thing! Walking in, its very cute and clean and still pretty brand new looking. I ended up getting \"The Carolina\" combo, pulled pork and ribs along with two sides(creamy cole slaw and baked beans). I think he got brisket and pulled pork. The only downside is it was almost $20 a meal! Geez. But I noticed they have weekday lunchtime specials, so I'll have to come back for that.   It seems kinda cafeteria like, you can either wait in line to get it to go, or they might bring it out to your table. A little confusing, but no biggie. They also offer four different bbq sauces you pour yourself, jalepenos, pickles, and vinegar. That spicy sweet sauce is good stuff. You can't find Cheerwine around here, so I was so happy to see it on tap.   My pulled pork, cole slaw, and baked beans were awesome. You really do get a lot of food so that makes up for the high price point. So much food that I had to take the ribs home, totally looking forward to lunch today!  To sum it all up, finger lickin good!"}
{"text":"This place is okay for what it is - a slightly-better-than-fast-food counter service joint. The food is good and plentiful but if you're looking for authentic barbecue food, keep looking. Pretty standard fare for a bbq place: pulled pork, ribs, brisket, chicken, etc. I had the pulled pork and smoked chicken. The pork was good but the chicken had a very strange flavor. I didn't care for the variety of herbs/spices they use while smoking and it also just didn't look appetizing. I've had a ton of smoked meats and they have all that distinct smoked look and taste. This tasted like poached then baked chicken. My husband had their ribs and found them to be very fatty although they were very tender and flavorful.  As far as sides go, I recommend the green beans and fries. The fries are fresh cut, crunchy, and delicious! We also sampled the garlic mashed potatoes - good, macaroni and cheese - eh, and though we didn't have them, the baked beans looked fantastic. The cornbread was ok but what made the whole trip worthwhile was the honey butter they serve with every meal. Holy cow, was it good! I would've eaten that stuff by itself!  As for price, it seemed high for a counter service restaurant. We spent the same amount we would have spent at Famous Dave's, the food was comparable to FD's as well, and we would have had a sit down experience with waiter service."}
{"text":"It's nice to finally have some barbecue around the Strongsville area. It's not the best I have ever had but will definitely fill my BBQ cravings in the future. When I come here sometimes the ribs are hit and miss in terms of tenderness but the brisket is always spot on. I also always get they fries as one of my sides because the portions are good and they aren't soggy.  If your getting chow to go, they have pre packaged sauce cups you just have to ask. Also, I never thought I would be commenting on hot dogs at a BBQ joint but the Tar Heel dogs are probably my favorite thing on the menu."}
{"text":"I took an employee here as a reward, it was his pick.  I had never been before.  While waiting for him to arrive the smells of the BBQ were really great, and got me excited for what was to come. Upon arrival at the ordering window the young lady came out and explained the menu and specials to us and answered our questions.  She did a great job.  Her name started with  K and it was really long and different and I don't remember it but she was great.   I got the BBQ Beef Brisket Sandwich and fries. He got a half slab of ribs and some sides.  I asked if the brisket was sliced thin as I like it thin.  I was told that it was, but I found it was sliced thicker than I like (I am looking for lunch meat type thinness, this was about 1/4 thick).  It didn't matter because the brisket was so tender that it fell apart in your mouth while eating it.  Good sized portion too, with a nice smokiness to it.  My employee enjoyed the ribs but found it was a lot and took half home.    Good food here, friendly employees, clean restaurant.  Prices are a bit steep for me, averaging $15 each for lunch.  Too expensive for me to visit often, but good enough to come back for a special occasion.  I enjoyed the food and will definitely return for more!  4 stars because it was really good, but I know there is better BBQ out there.  For a chain, however, it is as good as it gets.  You will only find better at a locally owned mom and pop type restaurant."}
{"text":"If this is how barbecue is in the Carolinas, I don't want to go.  Very dry meats, very over the top prices."}
{"text":"I got the platter with the all the different meats and it was soo good. The sauces they gave me were also good."}
{"text":"Tried something for the first time at Old Carolina BBQ - hot dogs covered with beans and cole slaw. It was not only delicious, but huge. I almost couldn't finish it. I also got some hush puppies, which are my personal favorite. One my my guests had the 3 slider sampler and thought the fried chicken was just okay. My other guest, a kiddo, loved the Mac and cheese and couldn't get enough."}
{"text":"I used to love Old Carolina, but this trip made me just say meh. Our food came our lukewarm and literally no one else was there.   I ordered the two meat sampler with pulled pork, pulled chicken, hush puppies and mac and cheese. Everything was just okay - relatively bland. I used the sweeter BBQ sauce and it helped, but not by a lot."}
{"text":"So I put an order in online, wife picks up the order and the forgot the bake beans. I called them so I could get my money back. Not only did they give the money back but they told me they would comp my bill 10% with out me even asking for it. Now that's great customer service,  going above and beyond. Oh and their  food is great as wellThank you for the great customer service experience."}
{"text":"I'm a very busy woman & I HATE cooking but what I hate even more is this so-called convient BBQ restarant. I placed an order over the phone & was told it would take no longer than 10 minutes. I knew they were packed when I drove by on my way home so I gave them 20 before I left. When I arrived, I was frustraighted that I had to wait in the same super long line as those who have yet to place their orders. There is no seperate register/window for pick ups so if you're in a hurry- forget it. It took me over a 1/2 hour just to make it to a register!!!  When I finally reached the order counter, my food had yet to be prepared....so as I stood in line & watched customers who had just walked in & placed their orders no more than 5 minutes ago get their food before me I was pretty irked. I had already been waiting for 50 minutes for my order! They clearly felt I had time to waist, so I did- as I stood there watching the staff there was so much disorginization- the staff was running around like ants trying to avoid a magnafying glass on a hot summer day. And there was multipul stressed shouts of \"Where out of this...\" or \" I can't find my ticket for this order\".  So after 60 minutes I finally got pissed, had to step out of line & get right back in just so I could reach a register to cancel my order & get a refund. Just as I was getting my money back, my order finally arrived but I refused to take it. The manager (Jarieo or something along these lines) NEVER appoligized!!! What he should have done was given me my money back & my meal for free but he didn't say one word to me. Then as the transaction was going down, the cashier asked if she could take another call in order & the manager said \"No\" & told her to take the phone off the hook- can you believe this guy!  Extremely unprofessional!!! I don't care how good this place smells when I'm shopping in that plaz]a, I will never waist over 60 minutes to get service/food ever again!"}
{"text":"Good food, prices were reasonable and the service was spectacular.  You should know that this is not a full service concept- you order at a counter and food is brought out. That said, they bussed the tables, checked on us twice to make sure we didn't need anything, and even came over after the food was there to give our kid some crayons and paper to doodle on.  I can't in good conscience give this place less than five stars, but hopefully yelps stoopid algorithm will keep the review as \"recommended\". It's a good restaurant with great 'que and great people running it. Go there!"}
{"text":"Great little place to get a quick meal. The brisket is always tender and very tasty. The staff is very pleasant. I would recommend a combo for a first visit. The Texas is the best combo if you are a fan of ribs and brisket. Cheerwine (diet or regular) nuff said!! :-)"}
{"text":"Had a really great customer service experience here last night and wanted to give them a 5 star review.  David was a huge help when we came in...walked thru their different options they had and different specials and helped us pick out what would be the best bang for our buck. He was very helpful and never rushed us all while helping us save a few bucks.  The full rack of ribs for $13 is a steal - very meaty bones. The green beans are fresh, the baked beans are not overcooked like everywhere else you go (and fresh as well), and the brisket....that is the show stealer. No need for sauce at all, the smoke and rub is all you want which is a testament to the quality of cut and smoke.  They do have an array of sauces (which they keep warm....not much worse than some other places that give you cold or room temperature sauce) and the original and sweet and savory are my favorite. Good place to go and they had the games on; we will definitely return."}
{"text":"Love the food! Staff is always working quickly and accomedating to the customers. Love that I can order online and pick up with no wait."}
{"text":"Oooo what a disappointment this place was. We ordered (takeout) a family pack. This stated it would feed 3-4 people (leftovers!) Our selection was brisket ($2 extra), mac n cheese, root beer glazed sweet potatoes, and then it came with six cornbreads (the star of the night.) The sweet potatoes were just....not good. You think root beer glazed and instantly think of sweet caramelized goodness. Nope. These tasted like apple cider vinegar, and not at all like root beer. Total let down. As other reviewers have said, the mac n cheese was bland. I added some garlic powder and pepper at home and even then it really had no flavor. The brisket was fine, it was standard but not anything I'd crave in the future. I tried three sauces, a 'tangy', the classic 'sweet', and their Carolina version. They were all pretty good, no complaints there. Also, as stated briefly above, the cornbread was good. You got six smallish ones, they were moist and tasted yum!  Overall, it was a mediocre meal at best (total cost $30 for two people, fwiw.) A real waste of a cheat dinner, lol. We will stick with Famous Daves over in N. Olmsted, or the local establishments and skip this one in the future. Such a shame!"}
{"text":"Oh man, the past reviews are killing me.  Have you never tasted southern or Carolina BBQ? The BBQ in the midwest doesn't compare- you shouldn't need to slather meat with sauce to make it good!  Anyways, gripes aside, Old Carolina BBQ was great! A couple of friends (one from Houston, the other from Carolina), claimed it was the most authentic BBQ they've had in Cleveland, so off we went to try it.  We split \"the ultimate\"- 4 ribs, beef brisket, smoked turkey, smoked chicken, with two sides- we chose the mac n cheese and the hush puppies. To top it off, we got some cherrywine and sweet tea.   Oh man, it was GOOD. The meat from the ribs were excellent, as they about fell off the bone. The sauces were great as well- definitely the more vinegar-y taste that Carolina BBQ is known for.  I was entirely stuffed. But definitely worth going to. I'm pretty shocked at some of the low rated reviews, as I thought this place was pretty amazing. Don't go to some fake place like Famous Dave's or one of those fake fake chains...go to Old Carolina for some meat-lovin BBQ time!"}
{"text":"Honestly got drawn in by the AMAZING smell of the place. The smokers out back are like a siren's call. The pulled pork was so tender and delicious but the sides were lacking. Great music and atmosphere tho!"}
{"text":"Good barbecue on the fast!  Had the pleasure of seeing the monster smokers these guys use and the quality of their ingredients.  You can't go wrong with the BBQ here, especially in an area where places like this never last (where r u tony romas?).  Look for another east side location soon in mentor....."}
{"text":"I stopped in with my girlfriend his afternoon for lunch. We got the pulled pork sandwich, brisket sandwich, fries, slaw, hush puppies, and Mac and cheese. We sampled each of the sauces they had out. Everything was good and the portions were good too. The original sauce was the best. It's not the best BBQ I've ever had, but it wasn't the worst either."}
{"text":"I'm only gonna give this place 3 stars because the pulled pork is bland tasting . The ribs they seemed to hit on the mark with the seasoning. The sides vinegar Cole slaw ,baked beans excellent . I also ordered the macaroni and cheese which was bland as well it was cheesy but tasted like a little pepper and paprika would have helped a long way. The baked beans had nice pieces of pork in them and was pretty good the staff was super nice and helpful with my order being my first time there . The beef brisket was tender and juicy needed a tad bit more seasoning but when you put that sauce on there great tasting sauces I liked every last one of their sauces ! Their sauces make up for the lack of seasoning. The inside is wonderful decor I was pressed for time or I would have dined in they have paper towel rolls on table and a sink station /finger washing station for your sticky little fingers! I would return I would order ribs as my meat and definitely those beans. I waited about 15 minutes for them to complete my order. Very nice staff and clean place."}
{"text":"I admittedly have not had much experience with barbecue but I found the food here to be delicious! I got two sliders and I thought I would like the pulled pork one most but the grilled chicken actually turned out to be my favorite. I had it with lettuce and pickles and it was really, really good. The atmosphere is nice and the restaurant was clean, the service was quick and friendly, and the cornbread is amazing. My only critique is that they were playing country music, but it is a southern style restaurant and it definitely matched the overall ambiance. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Huge portions, flavorful sauces, meat is cooked to perfection.  This is definitely one of the best barbecue joints I've ever been to. The brisket is cooked properly, which is my main criterion for judging a bbq restaurant.  Overall a great experience and the vibe of the place is pretty cool too."}
{"text":"Hubby and I are here for the first time. We ordered the Sampler to get familiar with various BBQ selections. Portions are abundant--one sampler between the two of us is enough for dinner tomorrow too!  Nice selection of sauces Taste is great--the closest we found to Sonny's Barbeque (no Sonny's BBQ in Ohio yet). I would've given it 5 stars but the music selection was stomach acid producing and the  employees need some training as we were not welcomed upon entering nor asked what we wanted to order. They both just stood there at the cash registers. Overall, it's a wonderful fast food alternative with a slow-food taste!  ;)"}
{"text":"I was quite happy with my first experience at this strip mall restaurant.   Since it was my first time I gave The Ultimate Sampler Combo a try. When split between two people the $20 sampler is a great value and provides more than enough meat: ribs, pulled pork, brisket, pulled chicken and smokey turkey. The portion of the pulled meats were large and really in and of themselves enough for a sandwich.   Cornbread and two sides also come with the sampler. I tried the fries, which were average, but a massive portion, and the baked beans which were really, really good.   The pulled pork and chicken were my favorite, followed by the brisket. All the meat was rather lean and juicy. Various sauces were available for adding to the meats and as a nice touch were dispensed warm.   The staff was really friendly too. Totally not expected at a fast casual restaurant, but while we were eating one staff came out and asked how everything was tasting and if we needed anything else.   I'd go back again if in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I have been to the Fairlawn location more than 20 times and was thrilled when this location opened. The food is outstanding and I have not experienced the poor quality mentioned in other reviews in a dozen visits. I will agree that the staff here is not as good as the Fairlawn location, but the service isn't bad, just slow at times."}
{"text":"Used to really like this place, but unfortunately it has completely changed. The food came out cold- all 5 people at our table. Pulled pork and turkey seemed like it came right out of the fridge. Mac n cheese was sent back 3 separate times due to being cold. The pop machine had no CO2 and the BBQ sauce was empty. When requested to refill, the BBQ sauce was refilled but also ice cold. It used to be warm. The manager offered our friend who had an issue with the Mac n cheese a smile card for a return visit. He actually sent it back since he has no interest in returning. When my husband and I complained to the manager about our cold entrees we got nothing but an apology and a thanks for letting me know. Truly disappointed in the food and lack to rectify the bad situation for the entire table. A employee who represented himself as a regional manager also gave us a similar lackluster response. Not how you treat an unhappy customer. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"It's a so so chain BBQ restaurant. The prices are on the higher side unless you're enjoying a lunch time special. The staff is friendly but the wait for food is ridiculous. I tried a meat sampler and was not impressed by the BBQ."}
{"text":"I have been cooking BBQ on Big Green Eggs for over 10 years. I have been to Texas, lived in the Carolinas, Alabama, and so on. You get the idea. I love true BBQ and its hard to find in northern Ohio. I ate here for dinner last night with my family. This place is set up the way a BBQ place is supposed to be set up. Real smoke smell the moment you open the door. Its actually a pretty upscale place compared to some of the places I have visited in the South.  Like those you wait in line to place your order and they bring it out to you when its ready.  The BBQ here was simply perfection.  I ordered the ribs and pulled pork combo.  Ribs were cooked perfectly.  Moist, tender, and you had to bite the meat off the bone without it all falling off.  Perfect.  Pulled pork was also just as outstanding.  Sauces were all done well and were delicious.  Sides were all spot on as well.  Only complaint I'd have about the baked beans are the kidney beans.  I don't care for kidney beans in my baked beans.  But that 's not enough to drop a star.  I tasted the fries which are made from scratch with were great.  And the Hush puppies reminded my mother-in-law of the hushpuppies she used to get in Alabama.  Service was quick and friendly.  And it was reasonable.  We fed 2 adults and 2 kids for around $40.  Kids meals come with 1 side and a drink.  With cookies.  Overall this a great addition to the area.  I now have a local BBQ place to call home."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place.  I got the 3 small sandwiches so I could try a little of everything. The pulled chicken was not good...more like the left over pieces-parts and lots of grissle. It was also cold...as was the pulled pork...I also got the brisket and it was ok. The fries we pretty good. I watched the kitchen staff and didn't see a lot of pride on what they do.  More like a fast food joint.   So I was pretty disappointed.    I don't know how long they'd been open.   I may give them one more chance....maybe."}
{"text":"The prices were reasonable. The portions were large.  My husband and I shared a sampler platter.  I didn't care for the bake beans. They tasted more like chili.  The meats were all tender and moist and had a great taste. The people were friendly and helpful.  The water tasted moldy and some of the hush puppies were not done.  I would visit this place again."}
{"text":"Beef brisket sandwich with a side of garlic mashed potatoes and some sweet tea.   Brownie points for extra lean cuts and lots of meat!  However, I would have liked a smokier flavor and a little char flavoring. I don't like to add too much sauce to the meat.  Garlic mash is delicious!  Sweet tea is also good."}
