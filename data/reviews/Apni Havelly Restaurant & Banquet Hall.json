{"text":"The food was great we went on a weeknight for my birthday and ordered multiple curries and the meat platter. My favourite were the onion naan and butter chicken. And to top it off with a mango milkshake and kulfi for dessert. I believe there is also more selection on weekends when there is the buffet!"}
{"text":"I love Indian food and when I find a tasty buffet it's a family favourite place that gets my loyalty and plenty of advertising, on the house. Unfortunately this 'Devs Haveli' doesn't even come close to making my list. 

What a crappy experience. I don't recall (before now) ever seriously considering just getting up and leaving before really starting my meal. I persevered with my poor children who couldn't even stomach the plain rice, which was hard and crusty.

Speaking of crusty...no, the staff were polite enough, it was the food that was drowned in oil and crusted on the surface. I stood there unbelieving as I watched a man walk around the buffet stirring the measly amount of food to decrustify everything.

The potatoes looked like they were more than a day old. A couple meat dishes (I assume they were meat) truly resembled canned dog food. The item labelled as butter chicken was clearly not so I asked if they would serve any and was advised it would be out in a half hour. What came was yesterday's leftover tandoori chicken in a poor curdled cream disguise. Unbelievable!

On to the service which was highly lacking simply due to the clear inexperience of every person on the payroll. My husband's $2 diet coke actually made us laugh as it came in a small white wine glass which held about 3 or 4 man sips. I joked that he should have asked for 2 more upon being served. To top that he didn't get to request a refill, and none was offered, as we were essentially forgotten.

I'd like to cover all the reasons we have for never returning again, but really, I'm not that cruel. It is what it is, try it if you will, but if you read this and go....
I told you so."}
{"text":"Decent enough buffet with selection of food. Naans were super fresh and the fresh BBQ area was a nice touch. Service was good....place lacks atmosphere."}
{"text":"i bought some take out. one of their daily special. food quantity was good, however we checked the buffet prices and they were outrages, buffet quality did not look good either."}
{"text":"I had their Saturday and Sunday buffet one weekend as we attended two wedding functions held there on consecutive days. We shared the buffet selection with general public. I'm not sure if it was because of the weddings or not, but the selections were impressive and enormous for any desi buffet I've been too. I was especially happy with the veggetable selections. The chicken tikka was really good. Haleem was good. Fish pakora was good...had lots of it. I really wanted to try the nihari, but was too full. I'm hoping to go back another day just for the buffet. I hope the selection would be as plentiful even without a concurrent wedding function. Everything was a bit on the spicy side. I occasionally like extra spicy food, but may be hard for someone not used to it."}
