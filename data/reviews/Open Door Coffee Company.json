{"text":"very good coffee. I like it better than star*ucks. The staff is ultra friendly also. Atmosphere is great! They also give you free refills while you are at the cafe."}
{"text":"Nice presentation large coffee bags and historic references on walls.  Young barista wears a 'huge' genuine smile.  Service levels are excellent and dark roast was exceptional very flavorful and full bodied.  Pride in operation is very evident at this location.  Skip the norm Schultz doesn't need you money, and give this corner location in historic downtown Hudson a try.  You will not be disappointed. Definitely coming back again soon!

{"text":"Great place to stop before or after the events on the green. Friendly staff and great selection."}
{"text":"A great place to meet an old friend and talk for hours.

Really cozy coffee shop with friendly staff.  Very comfortable seats.

I had a good cappuccino and they were attentive to details about preparing it."}
{"text":"Came in mid-afternoon for a recharge after driving hundreds of miles from Connecticut for a wedding. Was treated to a half caf/half decaf cold brew iced coffee. Can't recall ever seeing a place do cold brew decaf before (usually too much hassle). But the owner explained she likes coffee after 2PM, and likes cold brew, so they brew decaf cold brew. Works for me! She could also tell how fried I was after my drive (and could hear my kids going crazy in the corner of her shop), so very graciously sold me a size XL iced coffee which isn't a size they typically sell for cold brew orders. Really appreciated that. Clearly a place that understands that small little gestures can make a big difference in giving customers a great experience. I went back in the other mornings I was in town for more cold brew, and introduced others in my party to Open Door, and they raved about how great the coffee was. It's just a coffee shop, but a charming place, and everything I would want a coffee shop to be. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Great service and great coffee! The barista's know how to make the drinks right. Ordered a pumpkin spice latte cold and it was better than Starbucks! Highly highly recommend. The atmosphere is great too. I love the decor. AND! I love the REAL flowers at the tables!"}
{"text":"A true specialty coffee shop on the Hudson square. Expected to be forced to drink corporate coffee this entire trip but found this quaint little shop. The cappuccinos are well made. And they actually know how to make pour overs. Try the Costa Rica as I did."}
{"text":"Awesome little place. I stop by on Saturday's during my daughter's softball practice.  Staff is super friendly & polite.  Great coffee too!"}
{"text":"The owner and staff are very friendly.  The owner came from behind the counter to walk around, check on everyone, and pick up a bit. The decor is bright and cheery and even though it's not big, you have a variety of options to sit: at the counter, table or comfy couch."}
{"text":"Stopped in off the thruway for a cup of coffee. Charming town, Main Street, and coffee shop. However, they added a hefty surcharge for about a tablespoon of almond milk in my drip coffee and were a little rude when I pointed out that such a charge is usually only applicable for espresso drinks. A little frustrating. Coffee is eh, better than Folgers."}
{"text":"This place has the dark wood interior of Civilization with the hippie vibe of Gypsy Beans.  Plenty of counter seating, which I always dig.  Fair trade coffee.  My whole milk latte was on point...big and bold yet super smooth.  Another coffee house that gets it right. $3.25 for a small latte..good price.  Maybe some day they will offer coconut milk.  Until then only almond and soy milks are offered as milk alternatives."}
{"text":"This is, by far, my favorite local coffee shop! Their staff is so friendly and passionate about their business, and they make THE BEST cappuccino I've ever had. 

Attention Harry Potter fans: They make a butterbeer beverage!

And how adorable is this seasonal coffee cup sleeve?!"}
{"text":"Great coffee shop in downtown Hudson. Plenty of seating, tasty joe and a super friendly staff. The guy who served us followed up a few minutes later to make sure that everything was ok. I liked that a lot. Props to these people."}
{"text":"Nice coffee bar/ house, in a beautiful quaint town. Friendly staff plus the rustic d√©cor made the place feel like home. Comfortable study in environment with plenty of seating. The coffee and cappuccino was delightful. I would certainly visit Open door whenever in the area."}
{"text":"I've been to open for a handful of times, and the coffee is always well-made, the atmosphere is charming - the place is usually filled with small groups of students from Western Reserve Academy, and the staff is very friendly. 

They serve a variety of pastries and muffins, but I only wish they would start serving breakfast sandwiches, too. That would make it the perfect place to pick up breakfast on the way to work."}
{"text":"The best pumpkin latte in the area. Real pumpkin! And the joint is cozy. They have a changing display of interesting art, and good music to listen too. They even have great, fresh gluten-free treats for bellies like mine. It's in the center of Hudson, so it's easy to sit for a bit and then walk about town."}
{"text":"Open Door just opened up this summer. It's the first truly local coffee shop in recent years to open its doors to the Hudson Community, which frankly surprised me. It's an absolutely charming place to spend a few hours, meet a friend for coffee, get work done, or even have a business meeting. 

The coffee is fair trade and pretty good overall. The staff is knowledgable and mostly able to explain their various roast choices for the day quite well. One of the hopes I had for this place was that they would focus on good coffee rather than trying to please through various specialty drinks as say a Starbucks would (nothing against them...to each his own). This shop definitely delivers with a good daily selection of light, medium, and dark roasts to choose from. 

In terms of food there is currently a bit left to be desired. There's a few pastries, which are overall good, but not much else going on. In their defense - staff has told me that food is something they are working on for the near future - they just want to iron out all the opening kinks first! Totally understandable in my opinion. 

The baristas are conversational and super-friendly/outgoing. I've felt welcome every time I've stepped foot into the door. If you get a small mug for here, refills are free - a huge plus to someone like me for whom their coffee shop is almost like a second office! Overall I couldn't be more happy about this spot. It's a great local shop run by people right here from Hudson, who love the community and respect it's tradition.

HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU CHECK THEM OUT! 

***A few notes for the owners:
In hopes that the owners check out their business' reviews here's a few constructive criticisms. These aren't really things wrong - just thoughts that could make Open Door even better!

1. Food - Mentioned above, but it would keep people here longer!

2. Outlets - There is currently one power outlet in the entire shop. I know there's a whole bunch of folks who'd love to come and work (and be customers) here that need those. I know that I've come in and left if the seat by the outlet is taken - not because I want to leave - but because I came with the intention of getting a lot of work done (and buying multiple drinks) and couldn't do it there. Seems like an easy fix! 

3. Comfy seating. They've actually put in a couch since originally opening, but I feel like seating could be rethought a bit, during the lunch rush it's tough to find a seat. One thing I'm curious about is that there's an art gallery that shares space with Open Door. I'd enquire about partnering with them to put seats in the other side. Costumers have a place to sit and now are looking at potential art to purchase while sitting - seems like a win win to both companies working together."}
{"text":"Pretty good coffee. Lots of options. Yummy chocolate muffins. Friendly, knowledgeable staff.

TRY THE RED EYE."}
{"text":"Charming local coffee shop. Busy with people chatting, working, studying. They have a large variety of coffee drinks, teas and smoothies. Many holiday drinks and house specials available. Also a glass case full of freshly made scones, muffins & cookies (including gluten and dairy free). Enjoying my almond milk chia latte every much & will be back!"}
{"text":"First time trying out a new coffee house...I'm a Harry Potter fan and to see a Butterbeer Latte on the menu was right up my alley...together with a delicious cranberry orange scone made this a very nice September 1st morning  I will definitely be back...only thing I would change is to make the Large cup bigger"}
{"text":"I really like this place.. right on main street in downtown hudson. Free WiFi ,funky comfortable decor.  Barista was very friendly.  Ordered a double expresso which was delicious served in a very old almost antique cup and saucer(which I thought was cool). Also ordered a large black dark with nice flavor not bitter. Decent selection of beans for purchase.  I got a lb of Ethiopian to go. They do not roast in house but have a roaster in south Carolina the use he roasts to order for them.. nice local shop I definitely will be frequenting."}
{"text":"Sweet little coffee shop in an old apothecary in downtown Hudson.  Good espresso drinks and a nice place to sit for a stretch"}
{"text":"This cafe opened in the historic building that previously housed Saywell's, a local long time pharmacy/soda shop. After trying most of the local brews from Brueggers to Peet's, this coffee gave my husband and I, a pleasant surprise. Priced similarly to Starbucks, we felt better about supporting a local business and the coffee was up to par. I enjoyed a small iced coffee while my husband had a black hot coffee. We had a blueberry muffin, crumbly and perfect for our 1 year to occupy herself with outside on the sidewalk seating and a chocolate muffin for ourselves to share. The muffins were small, the chocolate one a bit dry and harder for my husband's liking, but I thought it was fine. We hope to stop back soon. Service was friendly and accommodating which other local coffee shops lacked."}
{"text":"What a delight! We went for a small breakfast this morning, and the employees were so jolly and welcoming! Coffees were creative (orange mocha!?) and delicious. We each had a pastry, which were excellent as well. The carrot cake muffin, omg. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It's decor is inviting and cozy. It's designed for comfort and encourages you to stay and read a little while you sip on a drink. Unlike most places nowadays that just seem to want to get you in and out to maximize profits. They have a huge variety of drinks and can make almost any combination you ask for! Another thing I noticed about this place is the staff treats you like a person not just a customer. I've noticed they have many regulars that they know by name and by drink. I really value you that in a place like this. It makes your experience much more enjoyable and easy."}
{"text":"Its our saturday go to for the best coffee in the area and a great atmosphere. Cozy..friendly..excellent rkast and wonderful assortment of fresh baked muffins. We love it"}
{"text":"I stopped by here this past Saturday for an afternoon pick me up with my wife.  The inside of Open Door Coffee Company is bright with natural lighting and has seats in the front and then a \"bar\" in the back with seats that looks like it may have been from an old diner.  They also had a display area next to the cash register where they sold things like scones and sweets.

On this day I decided to skip my usual Americano and instead go with a pour over.  Whenever I asked about the choices of coffee for it I was told about 4 or 5 different ones.  I ultimately chose the French roast and then proceeded to sit down and wait for our order.  In about 5 minutes my coffee was ready for me and was piping hot.  Whenever it had cooled down a bit I was able to try it and was impressed by how rich and smooth it was.  There was no bitterness at all and it seemed to be very well done.

The bottom line for me is that I would stop by here again in the future.  My coffee was good and I had my eye on some of the scones which I would like to try if given the opportunity."}
{"text":"This is my probably my new favorite local coffee shop. I love the small town feel with a welcoming staff. I highly recommend anybody in the area to stop by for a drink and hang out."}
{"text":"Open Door Coffee Company is easily one of my favorite places. When I come here and set up shop with my laptop, my creative juices are flowing instantly. Open Door Coffee Company is the cozy, artistic coffee shop I always wished I had in college/graduate school. Main Street in Hudson itself is a quaint, old-fashioned street that feels like sweet hometown nostalgia. 

I love the sprawling seating of couches, high tops and wood tables that remind me of my Mother's dinner table. The walls are adorned with vintage frames (for purchase) and quirky art. There's also a cute book exchange taking place above their faux fireplace, and the oddball books people leave behind are always worth a look.

The tea in Open Door is excellent. They also have quite a selection of coffees and pastries, and their lavender lemonade is to die for. Open Door has a quality to it which is just about perfect for anything: a first date, business meeting, or simply catching up with a friend. When i'm not with my laptop, you can easily find me lounging on the couches with a book I just purchased from The Learned Owl."}
{"text":"As someone who is still in mourning for the loss of Caribou Coffee, Open Door Coffee Co. is the next best thing. I used to love Caribou's espresso based drinks such as the Caramel High Rise, Light White Berry and Mint Condition. While a Caramel Macchiato from Starbucks will suffice it just isn't the same. 

Thankfully, Open Door offers drinks like Raspberry Blonde Mocha and Cherry Cordial to satisfy both my sweet tooth and my caffeine addiction. I have noticed this place has gotten steadily more popular with each passing year that it's open so hopefully it will be around for a long time."}
{"text":"It's hard to write a good review on a place this uninspiring. Hmmm, ba-bam! I won't then. Two stars. 

I guess if your into getting double, soy, almond, mocha, decaf, iced, pumpkin spice lattes with half syrup and double whipped cream and chocolate sauce on top, then this place may inspire you. I'm just not that into that sort of thing. But if you are, then go for it. Actually I've seen a lot worse. I'm adding an extra star for being a slightly pleasant local cafe where people can enjoy a sit and a read and a talk-with-friend-over-cup-of-coffee type a deal. But it just doesn't have the quality I've come to enjoy in coffee. 

Sadness. I decided to embrace the non-artisan coffee experience full effect. So I got a breve, which most specialty coffee shops don't make. Admittedly, it didn't taste too bad. I'm sure it was a lot richer And more coma-inducing than a latte or cappuccino would have been. 

Go here; don't go here. Do whatever you desire. You'll either be inspired or not be inspired."}
{"text":"As an avid Starbucks drinker, I rarely venture from my usual Starbucks Americano. However, this morning I decided to break tradition and give the new place a try. 

I was puzzled when I scanned the menu board and noticed that the Americano appeared to come in only one size - small (12 oz). At a price tag of $3, I naturally assumed that this must be a very special cup of coffee - to command a premium such as this. 

I inquired about the feasibility of obtaining a larger size, to which the barista obliged - for a whopping $5.50. Now I knew for sure I was in for a life-changing cup of coffee. At more than double the cost of my beloved Starbucks Americano, there was no way that I would be disappointed...

...or so I thought. This particular specimen lacked the trademark smooth finish that I've come to expect from a Caffe Americano. In its stead, a foul, almost sour finish that got far worse as the beverage cooled. After the third sip, it went right in the trash. $5.50 definitely NOT well-spent; and I won't be back."}
{"text":"If I had to rate a place on just the cold brew coffee I would give it a solid 5 stars."}
{"text":"A quintessential small town coffee shop with an eclectic vintage vibe. I'm not a coffee drinker per se, but liked my mocha latte, and my wife really enjoyed her cold brew. It had a little bit of a cherry flavor to it. 

They don't serve breakfast, but do have an array of scones and muffins to choose from"}
{"text":"Great hometown coffee shop. The inside could be a bit more cozy but that may come with time."}
{"text":"cute little coffee place + fast service + good coffee = I will come here again

Loved that they didn't have an issue using my reusable cup and the service was very friendly."}
{"text":"Open Door Coffee puts a modern twist on a speak easy style coffee house. This is one coffee house that will be receiving my business the next time I'm in Hudson. 

I drank the raspberry tea lemonade, and was not disappointed. This drink that could rival Starbuck's tea lemonade, it was so good. There were many different snacks / pastries that also looked delicious, but I'm trying to cut down on my sugar intake. 

The atmosphere of the coffee house was unique, artsy and quirky. In a world full of coffee houses, this one will stand out in my mind."}
{"text":"Cute little place in Cute Hudson. Friendly staff and great coffee and muffins. Love local coffee shops like this place."}
{"text":"Very nice store.  Coffee great. Service great.Wish the physical space inside was bigger. The hardest part is finding a place to park outside on the street."}
{"text":"We love the great coffee! Our son loves the Italian sodas with cream. Warm environment, genuine people."}
{"text":"This is a really nice small coffee shop with a friendly atmosphere.  My cappuccino tastes good.  I'll definitely be coming back here again."}
{"text":"The fact that I've been to Open Door more times than I can count should lend a little credibility to my 5 Star review!  This independently owned, one of a kind coffee shop oozes small town charm. The marble soda fountain counter and antique humidor, both original to the previous Hudson iconic landmark Saywell's Drug Stores & Soda Fountain, contribute to the ambience!  Trendy yet hometown classic, this place is always busy, yet somehow, I always find a comfortable seat. Whether you are a writer, a knitter, a group of Mom friends, a business person, or tourists, I highly recommend The Open Door as a delightful place to gather for refreshment. 
Every visit, emphasis on every, I have been greeted warmly and my order has consistently been prepared with attention to detail! 
If you want to get a feel for what Hudson is all about, this coffee/tea shop is a great place to start!"}
{"text":"I love this fair trade organic coffee shop. They have the best latte around. Yum!  A must stop if in the area. Great ambiance and free WIFI."}
{"text":"Really pleased this place is still here. We discovered a week into this cute local coffee shops opening. Great service and nice to see many people enjoying their coffee or tea and just hanging out."}
{"text":"I have nothing but extremely high praise for this little coffee shop. I'd never been to Hudson before and stopped in yesterday for a cappuccino before heading to the bookstore down the street. The place was packed with folks from every walk of life, from the postman to college students, young families to brooding poets. There wasn't an open seat, but I was headed out anyway. 

Oddly enough, I actually stopped back into Open Door a couple of hours later with a friend of mine. We grabbed some mochas and were lucky enough to nab two comfortable seats by the window...where we stayed until we closed down the place. I'd like to extend my sincerest thanks to the employees who were kind enough to not kick us out although we stayed beyond your closing time. We were in the midst of a long and heavy conversation, and your generosity was more appreciated than I can ever express.

Please support this small local coffee shop. This is exactly the sort of establishment I feel strongly about supporting...but be kinder to them than I was and make sure you leave before closing time."}
{"text":"Besides the awesome atmosphere and the fact it's not a giant chain. The coffee is great and not bitter. Also my latte was delicious. There needs to be more places like this"}
