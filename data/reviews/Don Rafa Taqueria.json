{"text":"I just had some cabeza and lengua  tacos from here and they were so good. I was craving a good taco so bad that I almost cried while eating my vegan leftovers. The meat was very tender. Like... uh... like... some kind of substance that rhymes with nutter... sutter? Buttah! Really good!   Oh! And the soft tortilla wasn't the kind that falls apart after one bite."}
{"text":"Good food is to be had at Don Rafa's for sure.  We hit them up occasionally and enjoy each visit.  Sometimes the staff could be more attentive but overall they take good care of you."}
{"text":"Gus said, pick a spot for dinner. Knowing he has not been here I picked Don Rafa as I liked my lunch for the most part.   6:30 pm Saturday night and no one in the place when we enter. Well two employees were sitting watching the game on TV, very loudly. I know I have mentioned this before, but I hate TVs in restaurants. I should have turned around and left, but chose not too. Both employees wandered to the hall at the back when we entered. NO greeting of any kind not direction to a table. We sat ourselves which I guess is OK since we were the lone customer. Another expressionless young man comes to the table to take a drink order. Must be the trade mark of the restaurant, no expression, no smile, no hello, no spark in the wait staff. I think I would pick something else as my trade mark.   We ordered one of those round cheese things, the name escapes me. It was fine, after all how can you screw this up.  I ordered the Taco Taco Platter and Gus had the Chile Relleno. I honestly have no idea what has happened to the food but it was just not good. I took bites of a few things and could not continue and Gus said the same about his. So we paid the bill and went on our merry way.   This was too expensive to try again and get crap food and lackluster wait service. Adios"}
{"text":"I have to say...there are not many times that food is good enough to surpass not so good service. This is one of those times.   I went here on a Friday night for a drink and a light dinner with my husband and daughter. When the server came over I asked if they have Margaritas...and she said yeah...what kind I asked?? UUUhhhh the red and the green one was the response...I was so shocked by this I could not even get angry...I laughed very hard on the inside. Anyway..I ordered the \"green\" margarita on the rocks ($4.50) and it was not too bad. The husband had the happy hour beer special for $2 and got 2 coronas.  To eat the husband and I shared the 3 taco plate and added an extra taco. We got 2 carne asada and 2 barbacoa with rice and beans ($8.95). The tacos were soooo yummy...lots and lots of meat with a sprinkling of cilantro and onion ...and thats it...the way tacos should be. They were served on a homemade corn tortilla that was thick and delicious. The barbacoa was our favorite and I found myself taking very small bites to make it last as long as possible. The rice and beans were perfect also.  My daughter had already eaten dinner so she ordered the sopapillas. They were totally like grandma makes...and were served in a brown paper bag piled high and accompanied by the little bear honey to drizzle on their already sweet goodness.  When we were done the husband decided he wanted to take home a taco with each of the different meats they offer ( I think are like 6 or more types of meat ) Which by the way when I asked what a certain kind of meat was that I had never heard of before to our server she told me to read the menu...thanks!! Anyway...sadly the were out of every meat except the two we already had...so we just got the 2 tacos 2 go. When the server brought them to us she was like...so are you done NOW? LOL...wow.  I do not think she meant to rude....I just think she was not experienced. But hey...I will definetly go back and am looking forward to trying their other menu items.  Go check this place out...and they serve Menudo all day Saturday and Sunday."}
{"text":"Basically, a good lil' Mexican restaurant in my neighborhood.   Both times I have been there, I ordered the three tacos.  The corn tortillas are small, homemade, and tasty.  They have 7 different types of meat to fill your menu item with and my favorite is Don Rafa Style which is carne asada and melted cheese with green chile.  The chips and salsa are hard to stay out of before you dig into your meal.  Their burritos are big and also very good.  I was a little disappointed with the sopapillas because they weren't doughy and were basically a fried wonton with cinnamon and sugar on it.  The service is really good and all of the waitstaff are very nice.  On the outside of the restaurant they promote a pretty good deal on a bucket of Corona, but I can't remember the exact amount.  There are always people dining there, but not so many that you have to wait for a table.  Check out Don Rafa - trust me, it's good."}
{"text":"Shout it from the Roof Tops of the West Valley! Don Rafia's is the best Mexican Food out here in the land of commercialized chain restaurants. If you are sick of conveyor belt Mexican food then please please please check this place out! It is off of Dysart Road in the Home Depot/Furniture Stores/ and Sam's Club parking lot. The only thing this place is lacking is a good location! The food is awesome, the service is spectacular, and did I mention the food was awesome! Every chance we get we eat here since during these economically challenging times mom and pop restaurants fall by the wayside like skinny girls in a all you can eat race."}
