{"text":"Arrived at 8:20 pm and was told they were closing in a few minutes and we would do a to go order just for you. Seriously, you had 3-4 table still dining and your establishment always closed at 9 pm. Been a loyal customer but sorry you may have just lost one. Good luck with wanting to leave home early for a Friday night."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Get there early because it can fill up by 1145am for lunch.  I don't understand the reviews that seem to view that as a negative towards the restaurant.

When I worked downtown we used to go there once a month or so.  Now that I don't work there, I still make a pilgrimage a couple of times a year for the food.  

Service is always pleasant.  Yes, it's busy, but the staff always seems to handle it well.  

Love their Gyros and Gyro Salads.  The french fries are also great.  Love, love LOVE Crazy Jim's!!!"}
{"text":"The 15th ave CJs is where I have always gone, with awesome pizza always!

The Washington st. pizza was a little soggy and WAY over loaded with feta cheese.  It messed up the balance.  A sprinkling of feta that gets browned with proper toasting of the pizza is all that is needed on the Penelope... and a little more chicken."}
{"text":"Super friendly service. Positive atmosphere. I ordered the calamari salad and it was DELISH."}
{"text":"Food was great! Pita is amazing... Prices are a little high for lunch and the area/parking is not great."}
{"text":"Food is very good. Wait time is acceptable. Quiet atmosphere."}
{"text":"Super authentic Greek good.. Inside the restaurant is actually small and holds about 20 tables.. They're always busy, so if your going here try to get there before lunch hours or after.. I had the gyro picado salad and it was very good."}
{"text":"Where do I begin with reviews for this place. I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Greek Food!!!! This particular location is so small, an eye sore, & not in the best locations. You cannot judge a book by its cover though. The food is the BEST!

I've tried almost everything there, but my all time favorite & that I always order every Friday is Spring Mix Ceasar Chicken Salad with the creamy Greek dressing. It comes with the most mouth watering Pita bread. If my body could tolerate eating here for lunch everyday, I would but I have to watch my girlish figure...without having to calorie count, haha!

Every Friday!!! Crazy Jim's, Love it!!!!"}
{"text":"just got back with a friend...it was only us and one other customer in the room.  water was served...after waiting what seemed like 20 mins.  I went up to the front where there was three staff just talking and informed them we were ready to order...waitress said \"sorry I just got here\"... I ordered the shrimp salad and my fiend ordered the calamari with raw veggies...we waited for another 20 or more mins for food while listen to staff talk....food arrived ...friend got greasy grilled veggies on salad...now the other customer has left and one other just came in. I had to find the waitress to let her know that they got the order wrong...she apoligised and offered to bring a new one...we had now already waited 40 mins. for salads when there WAS NO CUSTMORS...I said no thx.. there was 5 shrimp on my salad with lettuce and a few croutons for $11.00!  really!..when I paid the bill I let the waitress know I was not pleased ...she said \"I know you come here all the time\"...didn't take anything off the bill...when said we waited \"20 mins. before I had to ask to place an order\" she said \"i saw you come in ...it wasn't 20 mins\"...which contradicted  here original statement of \"sorry I just got here\"...really people?....so poor service....wont be back..."}
{"text":"Crazy Jim's has been a staple of downtown Phoenix for quite some time. They specialize in gyros and pita bread sandwiches. I've been there at least a dozen times, and honestly, it's just o.k. I've only had the steak and cheese sub, and it's good.  They tend to use too much cheese in the steak and cheese.  The sub rolls are small, but they make up for it with way too many fries.  I've only gone there with co-workers for lunch, and everyone seems to agree it's average food. A previous review mentioned Sticklers restaurant located across the street from Crazy Jim's. I think I'd stick with Sticklers, but co-workers keep dragging me back to Crazy Jim's.  I will say the staff is excellent and very nice."}
{"text":"All of Crazy Jim's menu is delicious!  Their food is authentic and made fresh daily!  My favorite is the Steak Picado Pita which includes Steak, Grilled Onion, Green Peppers and Jalapeño.  Add their homemade Tzatziki (with no sugar or preservatives) and you will absolutely love it!  

The pizza dough is also made daily and the wonderful flavor of the pizza sauce is great!   They have a great variety of toppings to choose from and the portions are great for the price.

I highly recommend you to go and try EVERYTHING on the menu!  

Enjoy."}
{"text":"Been here three times. Meh. I'd go back for lunch/dinner fare. Breakfast is distinctly \"meh.\""}
{"text":"Excellant food, excellent service.  Try the steak feta with grilled jalapeno on a fresh baked sub roll.  The fries are fantastic too.  We drive 15 miles into downtown Phoenix once a week just to eat here.  And we always bring home a pizza to enjoy later."}
{"text":"Crazy Jim's is a small greek joint with an eclectic menu. They serve all of the following: sub sandwiches, pitas, burgers, pizza, spaghetti dishes, gyros, baklava, calamari, and dozens of salad combinations.

I've only had their gyros and pizza - both of which I would recommend.

Also - the staff are always friendly and quick in my experience."}
{"text":"We decided to stop by this place, since we were in the area. We ordered take-out, after noticing that we had time, we decided to sit down and eat. But the histess infront of the rest of the rest of the dine in customers informed us we had to leave because we ordered tae-out. The tables were for dine-in customers only. So we decided to leave and because if the way she handled thr situation, we decided to leave and ask for a refund. The cashiers gave us the managers number, (he was not in at the moment), he asked us to wait for him. The way we were treated, we just wanted to get out of there. So he called the store so they could give us a cash refund, instead of charging back to our card. I ran back in and spoke to the cashier, he asked if I had the ice tea, &; he needed it back!!! So I ran to the parking garage to get the ice tea! Horrible cystomer service!!!"}
{"text":"I work downtown, so this is easy to get to by walking.  However, the owners are soooooo unfriendly!  The lady doesn't know how to smile or say hi, thank you, or have a nice day.  The wait staff isn't much better, they must be related to the owners!  When there are so many lunch choices downtown, I suggest you go some other place where your business is appreciated, especially in this economy.   Besides, the food is fair to average at best.  Don't bother, go across the street to Sticklers."}
{"text":"Great place, my favorite thing on their menu is their burger. By far one of the most delicious burgers I have ever eaten. Plus I love the bun that they use or bread they use because it's different and it really does help the burger differentiate. They customer service from what I've experienced is very well and they know what their doing. I will keep coming back."}
{"text":"Really good stuff w quick service. If you are in the area, its worth the stop. The feta is really good so watch out."}
{"text":"Good food but customer service is lacking. I ordered one thing and got another. And when I complained to the manager and asked for a replacement I was told I ordered the wrong thing.   We won't be returning. A shame because we live around the corner and love to support our neighbors."}
{"text":"Wonderful service, great for delivery to the office! Spicy hummus is THE BEST! Calamari salad is wonderful!! Everything is good!"}
{"text":"This is one of those places where no matter what you order it will always be delicious. I love this place. During the summer I eat here almost every friday, it is the easiest time for me to get away from the office. Whether you sit at the counter or at a table the service is great. The owner is the sweetest guy in the world. Always happy to see everyone and remembers people by name. If you want some really great Greek food this is the place to come. You will not be disappointed. It gets really busy at the lunch hour so be prepared to wait but it is so worth it."}
{"text":"Their Feta Shrimp Salad is my favorite.  It's by far the best Greek salad I've ever had.  There are tons of vegetables, the perfect amount of shrimp - grilled just right, and the pita they serve with it..delicious.  

The service is a little slow at lunch time because they get a rush hour thing going on.  1pm it clears up a little.  The staff is great though, very friendly and totally accommodating."}
{"text":"The food is made fresh and the waiters are super friendly. I ordered a calzone and the portion was more than I could bare to eat. Was weary from the sights of this restaurant from the street but once I stepped foot in, all those worries were gone. Cute and small. Happy to give this private establishment my business."}
{"text":"First time here today. I ordered the Gyro Picado and while really tasty, was so greasy that the pita fell apart."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years for breakfast and lunch. It's so convenient as I work in the downtown area. Great place to meet for business or with friends. Their chicken picata pita & pasta salad is my favorite."}
{"text":"My wife and I were visiting AZ and stopped by Crazy Jim's for breakfast.  WOW!  Owner is super nice, and not just with us but with all his customers, staff was nice, and the Steak Breakfast Burrito with Salsa Verde and potatoes was exceptional!  My wife had the horizon omelette and was excellent.

All I have to say is, if you are in that area you have to try it out!

Thanks to Al for making our visit welcoming and for great service to Brenda, our waitress, and to your cook for a delicious breakfast!"}
{"text":"What is the excitement about this place? The food is below average, a bit overpriced, poor service and a zero for atmosphere. Greek pitas and they don't even have lamb."}
{"text":"It was a bit loud but the portions were generous and tasty. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Although the service from Claudia was excellent there were parts of the meal that left something to be desired I got the steak sub that came highly recommended and I was told they made their own blue cheese there so I got blue cheese dressing on a salad. The steak sub with feta was great, although I probably would have liked a more substantial roll. Although the salad was fresh and tasty the dressing tasted like plain yogurt with a very scant amount of blue cheese and if there was no seasoning or flavor to it. I pushed what I could of the dressing off of my side and ordered the Caesar dressing and that was excellent. I probably should have ordered the lemon chicken soup instead"}
{"text":"The last time I stopped in for a bite I had to dine solo after a very long drive on a hot afternoon .  The staff is upbeat and the atmosphere is welcoming.  I ordered right away and I enjoyed my made-to-order dish in under 10 minutes.  The place accepts amex which saves me a trip to the atm.  My fave is the chk picado pita.  I have tried their homemade hummus as well which is also good for taking home to snack on later.  Definately a gem in this area of Phx.  I will be back."}
{"text":"I've been going to Crazy Jim's for a while now just because it's a block away from my work. I really hate going there. The same blond lady at the take out register everyone keeps talking about is the ice princess. Every time I've been there to pick up an order is like I am annoying her to be there. She doesn't smile, she is rude, like she is doing me a favor for eating there. I always get their lunch special salad, however and due to the fact I have to look at this woman -i dont know if she is the manager or owner, I rather walk a few blocks and go to Coney Island where I'm welcomed with a smile, than to see the face of this b%tch. Sorry, but she acts like one."}
{"text":"The review by Jessica S. is correct -- the dressing for the salads is delicious and they put it on the side...so that is two positive things for the two stars I gave them.  However - if I pay over $10.00 for a salad...I want something OTHER than iceburg lettuce (even if it's just a little romaine and/or spinach) and pitted olives.  I asked for no grilled onions and light on the pepper -- when I received my plate, their were onions and peppers all over the place.  If you're going to offer \"salads\" as a main course...they should be worth it.  That was the worst $11.00 salad I've ever had."}
{"text":"We had a very bad experience here recently.  My friend arrived separately and parked where the attendant told her to.  He watched her park and wished her well as she went into the restaurant.  While we ate they had her car towed!  Four employees, including the owner, said they told us the car would be towed.  NO ONE said anything to us about the car during lunch.  What possible motivation could we have had to allow the car to be towed?  Cost $108.00 to retrieve car.  It was a very mediocre salad too!. Very small place - during half the lunch, someone was standing four inches from my elbow waiting to get out.  Yuck!  Never going there again."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza! Sadly that's the only thing I've sampled from there so far but after that I will be back for more!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place 5 stars. The food is good, the portions large, the price is right.

However, the last time my girlfriend and I went there we both ended up sick as dogs. Two different things, same stomach result. 

Hopefully they clean up, because I like this place. But I also dislike riding the toilet for 18 hours like it was the lead horse in the Kentucky Derby. Call me old fashioned."}
{"text":"OMG they have NEW OWNERS!!!!!  I am very pleased to say they replaced all the employees.  The terrible wait staff and front register blonde mean lady are gone baby gone!  Now when you walk in you are greeted with a smile and a warm welcome.  The service was great, quick and friendly. I always order the Chicken Feta Salad and it was great.  If you have not been there lately because you hated the service like I did, no need to worry anymore.  Give the new owner a chance, I bet you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I used to be a big fan of this place. I mean every weekend with the whole family fan! I have had 2 bad experiences that happened so long ago it doesn't even matter. Tonight was just the last strike for this location. I took a friend there for their first time. I had been talking about how great their food is all day. My friends soup and gyro were both cold when she got them. My salad was warm. Usually soup and gyros-warm. Salad-chilled. YA know??? Anyway, we finish eating, I pack my leftovers to go and there was hair on the bottom of my plate. Once I got to the register I let the cashier/waitress know how we felt about our visit and she still charged me and offered an apology she may as well kept. I knew this location wasn't clean but WOW! This isn't the first time I leave unhappy but it is the last. I will never return and I'm spreading the word!!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  The gyro meat is very flavorful and moist.  The pita bread is fresh and tasty.  My wife gets the salad with gyro meat and she doesn't ever need to use dressing, however, if you enjoy ranch dressing, theirs is deliciously homemade.  The staff is friendly, but the restaurant is a bit tight for parties over 6 people.  One of my favorite places to eat in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"I like going to this place for lunch.  I usually get a chicken feta pita or chicken feta salad (I love feta!).  This place can get pretty busy during the lunch, but they are usually pretty good at seating us quickly.  The other thing that is great is they can do separate checks, and you pay up front as you leave.  This makes it easy to dine with coworkers so you don't have to mess around with the bill (especially if you only get an hour lunch break!)  Good Greek food."}
{"text":"First time coming. Had a a great omelet. Manager asked me if I was military. I told him no but he still gave me a discount for being straight with him. . Small gesture made my day. Waitress and manager were very nice. Omelet was awesome and was priced to sell. 5 stars"}
{"text":"Love this place! Good food, great customer service! My favorite is the calamari salad with warm pita bread. It's to die for."}
{"text":"Let me just say that the most important part of a Greek salad (besides the Feta) is the dressing.  Crazy Jim's knocks that out of the water.  When I first started coming here I'd order the grilled chicken Feta salad.  Excellent - and huge.  Their pita is awesome.  Then I discovered the calamari Feta salad.  OMG.  I'm addicted.

I always get the same waitress and she's as friendly as she is beautiful.

As long as I work in the area I'll be there over and over again.  Even if I change locations I'll probably drive."}
{"text":"My first experience with Crazy Jim's was when my boss ordered it in for the whole office. It seemed like I had barely given our secretary the order when {poof!}, the food appeared! First impression: Crazy Jim's has Crazy Fast delivery! 

Then, I bit into the warm, doughy pita bread. Brushed with a bit of oil before grilling, it seems to be homemade, and was absolutely delicious! Second impression: Crazy Jim's has the best pita I've ever tasted...

I moved onto to my chicken feta salad with creamy greek dressing. Chicken = slightly charred, but not too dry, and totally delicious. Feta = abundant and high quality. And then, there's the creamy greek dressing... oh my zeus, it is amazing! Creamy and garlicky and completely drool-worthy. I now crave it frequently! Overall impression: This. Place. Rocks.

We still order in to for the office every once in awhile, but I also frequent the restaurant on my own. I've dined in and ordered takeout, and every time, the food is more than satisfactory. I must admit that I'm hooked on the chicken feta salad, and I have only slightly branched out from there (the goat cheese salad, which was good, but not as good as the chicken salad!), but my other half has eaten their calzones and other items and has always been pleased as well. 

We just moved less than half a mile away, so I can see a lot more Crazy Jim's in our future!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Crazy Jim's. It is super crowded at lunch time and lacks the most comfortable seating, but that's OK because they DELIVER!

I haven't had anything bad on their menu, but the by far the best dish is the crazy salads. All of them are amazing and there's nowhere else in town to get a salad like that - no lettuce but cucumbers, cabbage, tomatoes, etc. instead. The feta cheese and pita bread that come with the salad both taste like they are made there from scratch - if they aren't you can't tell the difference. They also have the best salad dressings in town. The creamy greek and roquefort are my favorites. Both are a must try!

Next time you have a busy day at work and can't make it out of the office for lunch, call Crazy Jim's and you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Eat here all the time. New owner, great service authentic greek fare. My favorite Gyro Feta Salad with fresh made pita bread.. Forget about it! The personal pizzas are to die for."}
{"text":"This was a great find. All bread, pita and doughs are made in house and that extra attention makes all the difference. The pita and pizza dough are especially good. Try a calzone or pita sandwich, you won't regret it. I particularly enjoyed the calzone with chicken, feta and artichokes. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Update: Crazy Jim's manager Claudia reached out to me soon after posting my original review. She apologized for the confusion and for overcharging me and told me the next salad I ordered would be on the house. Just to reiterate, I love Crazy Jim's. Having them reach out, was the dressing on my salad! :)"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and have never been disappointed. My family also likes it very much. You can't go wrong with anything on this menu. Great variety!"}
{"text":"Great food and you get a lot of food for the amount of money you pay.   Nice little mom and pop shop and the waitress was awesome"}
{"text":"I have been going to Crazy Jim's for years and what has impressed me most is although under new ownership and management there has been no break in exceptional service or exceptional food! If it is possible, my all time favorites seem to taste even better. Maybe I'm just spoiled that my salmon is cooked just right every time on my feta salad. Without doubt, Crazy Jim's is by far one of Downtown Phoenix premier eateries!"}
{"text":"U gotta try the baked feta. Melts in your mouth and the pita bread is always so fresh"}
{"text":"Pizza day at the office... it was GREAT!  ZERO grease!  We had the Hawaiian Pizza.  It was big enough for 3 of us to get filled up on!  All of the ingredients seemed to be of the highest quality.  Very happy with lunch today!"}
{"text":"Well, I got there in pelting rain, so based on the other review with inclement weather, it seems the time to visit is in a storm.  Must do something good to the kitchen staff, because everything was quite tasty.

Mad props to the delicious gyros - piles of delicious meat on top of a soft pita bread barely large enough to handle the mammoth pile of savory beef.  

No need to order extra tzatziki sauce, the amount given by default was plenty and unlike many gyros the meat was still tender and moist.

Love the crazy decor inside and the friendly staff just topped off the experience.  Would definitely recommend to newcomers in the area since I never would have found the place by judging by the sparse building outside.

This Jim *IS* crazy...crazy delicious!"}
{"text":"Used to love this place. Seems like they changed vendors or something.  Calamari and shrimp are much smaller pieces, and quantity on crazy salads is much less. Music was blaring the last time in about a week ago, and server never came back to check on anything after dropping off food."}
{"text":"They were not even that busy and service was horrible! I had chicken Cesar salad and had barely any sauce so it was like lettuce and dry chicken, no flavor.
Will never go back"}
{"text":"when my favorite places to get them a gyro only bad thing is the parking lot is a guaranteed door ding or scratch no parking inside very small 2 but it works I like gyro because they cook their meat on the are crispy side the bread is a little thick the taziki sauce is delicious definitely a place to stop in for lunch just go after 1 because then it clears up no door dings"}
{"text":"I have to say I love this place.  The pita bread is fresh, and the gyro meat is flavorful.  Parking is kind of strange, but they make sure you can get in and out with their lot attendant.  If you are going for lunch, the earlier the better because it can get packed.  I want to come back for the Happy Hour from 3-9 for the $6 gyro platter and $2.50 beers."}
{"text":"***THEY REFUSED TO HONOR THE YELP CHECK-IN SPECIAL (Mondays buy 2 entrees and 2 drinks and get 50% off one entrée). Manager first sent over the waitress to tell me they wouldn't honor it, then came over himself to tell me they wouldn't honor it. I pointed out that two of our entrees had to be sent back because they were cold (after we waited a long time for the food to be served), and he finally agreed to give each of us 25% off our entrée. Very poor service and just ok food. If you're going to have a special on Yelp, honor it or remove it from Yelp."}
{"text":"Love the food, HOWEVER upon today's visits to pick up food I was greeted by a parking lot attendant who was questioning me as to my reasons for my arrival - I have never felt so disgusted in my life!  in regards to  parking lot attendant - it's my understanding you attend the parking ...not question guests as to their purpose of being on the property. Thats a shared driveway, my purpose, who im meeting etc is NONE of parking attendants business .I will never go again to pick up lunch.. IF  I even go back .  the fact that the owner is trying to control the driveway seems almost illegal.  AND to add insult to injury. ...I ordered my lunch with no onions. Hmmm. Clearly got that wrong."}
{"text":"Amazing!! I work down the street and just found this place... Where have you been all my life :)  I NEVER  NEVER eat bread... BUT.. The pita is soooo good that I couldn't resist!! I had a chicken Swiss salad (I asked them to give me mix greens instead of Iceberg and they did.. with a charge, but I was happy to not eat iceberg). Kinda expensive for lunch.. but very much worth it... Do not judge a book by the cover, its cute inside and the staff is nice!"}
{"text":"BEST PITA BREAD IN TOWN, MADE FRESH!
They no longer have \"several locations\"; the one on Bell Road closed down.  I really like this place.    Jim is often in charge of the food at the Greek Festival in the fall at the church near Lincoln, so you know the Greeks like and respect him!"}
{"text":"This place is uhhhh-mazing and delicious. Everytime I come, I am never disappointed in the food. It is pretty packed, but I still come because it is that delicious."}
{"text":"I work downtown and Jim's is a great place to grab a lunch when you want to take an extra 15 minutes or so.  It isn't fast at lunch time. But somedays that is okay.  Also, order everything as soon as the waitress greets you, otherwise you will probably get sloppy/slow service. But they are very nice about it.

I like their gyro meat and all of their housemade salad dressings are great. Their fries are also tasty.

I love the 3.99 breakfast special. (Eggs, hashbrowns, bacon/sausage, bread/pita)  They open at 7am and you can eat it at the counter. 

It isn't the best food in the world. It isn't the best service in the world. But it ain't that bad either. 

tip: Just call in your order and bring it back to the office if you don't have a lot of time and need a pita sandwich fix."}
{"text":"No Lettuce salads are dee-lish!

What's in a no-lettuce salad, you ask? Well obviously no lettuce... but cabbage, onions, calamata olives, cucumbers, tomatoes, onions and feta cheese. All salads are served with their awesome pita bread.

Some things I've tried here(not in one sitting):
- roasted red pepper hummus
- calamari
- calzone
- jalapeno burger
- chicken picado pita
- steak picado sub
- crazy chicken salad

This place is small but not short of service. HOWEVER, do not confuse this with the downtown location. That location is no bueno."}
{"text":"Although it sounds like a wack-job fly-by-night TV warehouse just from the name, don't be fooled nor should you underestimate the impressiveness of this grub-haven on 15th Ave. Last weekend my friend and I had an intense craving for Greek that neither Pita Jungle nor other places could handle.  

We realized that this place Crazy Jim's might be up to the task.  I had been told multiple times by friends who work in Central Phoenix about this place (another location on Washington is bonus), only to find myself busy, wanting something else, blah, blah, blah.

The freshly made gyro feta pita was heavenly. The pita was fluffy, the gyro strips were tender and flavorful and the feta cheese and tzatziki dressing were the icing on this cake, so to speak.  The accompanying steak fries are thick and crispy. Bobo opted for the spicy beef pita and was lovin it.

The environs are rough around the edges, but this low-key and spartan cafe delivers, amid the sound of local radio piped in via loud speaker.  The focus here is on the food and nothing else.  The servers were prompt, friendly and chatty, but not too much.

The menu is rife with tantalizing options including pita pizzas, pastas, subs and burgers, but I've never desired to stray from the solid and delicious pitas."}
{"text":"I love Crazy Jims, I was downtown and hungry so my old stand by was open. I got my usual the Gyro/Feta salad to go. When it rang up for $10.75 i was in shock...Its out of price for the little Gyro meat you get on top of iceberg lettuce....I hope this will change..."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars/ 5. 

I don't quite know what makes Jim so crazy, but I do know that this Greek maniac sure knows how to dish up some decent Mediterranean grub. Location isn't really the best, but if you're really into food, then going the distance to even the sketchiest of blocks is a must-do. Crazy Jim's is a small place just off of 15th Avenue and Indian School road. The prices are fair and the food is pretty good. I go for the chicken pita, which is always fresh and tasty. The chicken is seasoned well and is moist and the feta is as good as feta gets. This place is great for a lunch date, but I'd shoot for other options for dinner."}
{"text":"Seems every time I call for a delivery they can't.  Very disappointed with new management in this place.  2nd time I've complained about this hopefully they will take notice"}
{"text":"Way over priced and the on-line prices are nowhere near the prices they charge when you show up.  I explained this to the manager when I felt I was being overcharged and she simply tossed a to go menu at me and stated here are our prices.  I was charged nearly $12 dollars for a chicken pita and pasta salad.  The chicken was over cooked, dry and extremely salty.  The pasta salad was good.  Won't be back as there are much better quality at better values in downtown."}
{"text":"Not a bad place, service was good. Price seemed a bit high for what it was, I had the gyro pita which only had 4 slices of gyro meat on it. Pita bread was delicious. 

Parking can be a bit chaotic, but they have an attendant to help guide you and manage the flow. Inside feels a bit cramped for me, but it also seems like they do a decent carry out business."}
{"text":"I work across the street from this place and have been going here for a long time now. This place has always been very unfriendly but I tried to look past it. This morning was the worst of it all and I will never go back! I ordered the breakfast special with my eggs over easy. I was told my meal would be free since the last order was wrong. The owners daughter then proceeded to tell me that my meal was not going to be free. She said it doesn't matter if the food is wrong you still won't get it for free! I said that's fine I'll just take my food. She asked me to look at the eggs to make sure they were correct. Once again they were not over easy they wereover hard! I told her these are over hard eggs she said no that's how we make over easy. I told her over easy are runny. I had poked the eggs with my nail since I didn't have a fork. She then and I quote said to me \"why did you do that with your nail, we could have reused this food\"! I told you can't reuse this food that's gross! I would never want someone else's food that's been touched! Yuck! She told the cooks that I was making it a big deal about my eggs and if they can make them runny. I told her that was rude to say about me. Her answer to that was her cooks don't speak English so it's hard to communicate with them. I told her she made no sense and that's not my problem. My friend told her to talk to them in Spanish then and she told her she's not Mexican she doesn't speak Spanish! This whole time she was being completely rude to me and saying mean things. Once 3 detectives walked in she tried to turn it around on me and make me look like the bad one! The owner Jim whose is her father said to give me my money back. So she voided out my receipt. My friend and I were waiting for the new eggs to be made when the owner started yelling. He was saying what is she still doing here? I gave her money back I don't need her business! He came from the back and told me didn't I give your money back? I said yes. Then he said and I quote, \"Then get out of here I don't need your business. I'm too busy to remake your order\"! This place has the rudest people working for them and it's mostly family. I've never been treated this way before. I will never go back to this restaurant again!"}
{"text":"Great food at good prices! Small seating that fills up at lunch time! Well worth the stop!!"}
{"text":"Love this place but recently I've noticed it's not been consistent. Did they hire a new cook to take over lunch hour?! My usual salad wasn't as fresh tasting. The tomatoes and cucumbers looked like they had been refrigerated too long! Also the new wait staff...tsk tsk, he was unpleasant and un attentive. I was hoping the experience would get better but he hardly came by. Then the check arrived, we paid, he came back with the change and didn't say a word except here you go. Rude! If I'm feeling like my favorite salad, I'm going to try out the new location downtown. This place is great but like I said it's been really inconsistent."}
{"text":"I really would give this place zero stars if it was an option.  I ordered the Calamari appetizer and it was a greasy soggy mess. It was just a clump of congealed batter falling of the calamari rings. Dinner was a gyro and fries. The pita bread and the gyro meat was burned. The gyro meat was really gross and made me sick.
I will never go back and please do yourself a favor and stay away."}
{"text":"I'm 39 weeks pregnant and was craving a Greek Chicken Salad.

I looked up on Google and found this place not too far from my job. 

I ordered over the phone - was told it'd be 15 min. It took me about 10 to leave work, park and arrive to the front door. My salad was already ready.

I was greeted at the register with a smile and friendly faces (which THANK YOU FOR THAT) I didn't open my salad until I got back to work. It was a bigger salad - It'd didn't have onions as requested (THANK YOU FOR THAT) however some of the lettuce was wilted or slimy- which grossed me out. The chicken was delish and the pita bread was fab. so I had a few smaller chicken pita sandwiches with the provided dressing (which was good but garlic-ie)."}
{"text":"Honestly I never would have stopped to eat here if it didn't come highly recommended from a co-worker. It's a small mom and pop type place and when I first heard the name I thought it was a bar. However, The food is amazing! I have never had such an awesome gyro! The pita bread is made fresh daily! I will definitely return for more!!"}
{"text":"i've been going to Crazy Jim's for eons.  the place is more crowded than it used to be, but our waitress, Myrna, ensured that we had absolutely everything we needed and that our drinks were never, ever even close to empty.  my friend marveled over the fresh, sticky feta in her gyro with feta.  i was on a hummus kick, so i marveled over the freshly prepared hummus.  even on a busy night, the staff was attentive.  the food was excellent, and the prices reasonable.  i left a hefty tip for our waitress.  the meal, ambience, and service was worth every penny."}
{"text":"Pretty decent downtown lunch joint.  It's always packed, so get there early or be ready to wait.  I love the gyro with a giant side of fries.  I'm a sucker for tzatziki sauce, so I'll add that to anything and everything.  The restaurant is a decent size for downtown.  Parking is eh, you can find some street parking if lucky or you can park in the garage but I don't think they validate.  You can also take a free bus that runs in the downtown area called the DASH, but I don't recommended taking it during the summer."}
{"text":"We tried Crazy Jim's on a whim the other night  - Very good!!  The reviews here do not lie.  They have the softest, fluffiest, yummiest pita bread I have ever had!  It was almost like Indian fry bread... but not as fried.  Yum.

We had a couple of small pizzas, some hummus, and a side salad.  The prices were reasonable, the service was fantastic, and the food was awesome. 

My only complaint about Crazy Jim's would have to be the cramped dining area.  We squeezed in between a couple on a first date and a couple who had clearly been married since time began.  An interesting dichotomy (we are newly married...), but I am one that likes a little private dinner conversation (you know?)

Anyway, I think CJ's would be fantastic for lunch, takeout, or a quick low key dinner.  Go there.  Eat some yummy pita.  Leave full."}
{"text":"Met up with my mom for lunch at Crazy Jim's yesterday. Because of my amazingly stealth parallel parking skills and a handful of change, I was able to get a meter right up in front. We were seated right away, and were able to start catching up without issue. The menu options looked great, I went for the burger. Served just as ordered it had that homemade grill taste and I was very pleased. Service was great for a busy lunch time frame. I would go back again, loved that they had a counter for singles."}
{"text":"I love the food at this place and I have been dining here for years. However, only a 3 star rating can be given because the portion sizes are slowly declining yet the prices are increasing or staying the same. My chicken feta salad for $11 use to be worth it and there was plenty to eat and take some to go. Now the salad is served in a shallow bowl with half the portions of chicen, feta and veggies along with only a half of a pita bread. For $11 at least give me a whole pita bread! On all my experiences with dining out with coworkers, it never fails that the topic of poor portion sizes comes up. I really wish the owners would rethink portions because more often then not we end up going somewhere else for lunch because of this. I would so much rather to eat here but for the price patrons pay, we should get at least enough food to fill us up."}
{"text":"Our exhausted Family was brought to this great place by our local friend. The food was just right, the pita bread is some heavenly substance and taste, but the best part was that I left my wedding ring and another ring on the table and the server ran out to the parking lot and flagged us down.. Oh and the sangria was really excellent also. Not to mention four people ate and drank for under $70!"}
{"text":"Mmmmm, they're pita bread is divine! Golden buttery and grilled warm, with more deliciousness folded inside. Must admit - I've never actually eaten on site, but have come in to pick up and I'm pretty sure I'm not missing anything by only eating out.

Warning: if you do delivery or pick up, the fries will be \"sweaty\" or just downright soaked by the time they make their way to your mouth. A sad fact I can't seem to come to terms with and keep doing. But the other side option - past salad, I think - isn't very good."}
{"text":"The acid test for a Greek restaurant is clearly going to be the gyro, just as fish and chips is the test for a pub kitchen.  If you think paying $7.05 before tax for three small half dried up strips of gyro meat is acceptable, then you might like Crazy Jims. The big chunk of raw onion and the hard pink tomato slice did not make it any more apppetizing.  Now that IS crazy Jim."}
{"text":"I'm Crazy for Crazy Jim's!!  (cheesy, I know)

They have a good variety of food options.  The servers are okay; I wouldn't say they are super friendly, but they aren't rude either.  The service can be a little on the slow side, but not too bad.  And you pay at the register by the front door, not at the table.  That makes it easy to split the check with a group.  They just remodeled the inside and got rid of the booths that were falling apart.  Nice, new, dark wood tables that make the place look clean and organized.  

I have been enjoying their pitas for years!  The pita bread is great, the pitas are huge and served open-faced.  Best to eat with provided untencils as it's a little hard to pick up with your hands and not make a mess.  My favorite pita is the one with the jalapanos.  Many of my co-workers are fans of the pizza at Crazy Jim's.  I'm sure it is great, however, I can get a pizza anywhere.  When I go to Crazy Jim's, I want PITA!!!

I most recent discovery is the No Lettuce Chicken Salad.  A big plate of grilled chicken, huge chunks of feta, tomatoes, cucumbers, pepperchinis, some cabbage, all with an oil and vinegar dressing.  Not to mention pita bread on the side.  Very tasty!!!"}
{"text":"My first time here Diane recommended the Chicken Greek!! It was FANTASTIC!! My food came out rather quickly!! The staff makes you feel at home and really knows their menu! I explained to Diane that I was trying to eat something a little on the healthy side and she knew exactly what to recommend and how to order it!! See you soon Crazy Jims!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Have been coming to Jim's for years now and we attempt to venture outside of our usual but fail. We love the Chicken Picado Salad and Gyro Picado Salad. Always done right. If you're trying to head in during lunch hour expect a wait if that. Small nice establishment, friendly staff and bomb.com food! Food is flavorful and big portions. Not too sure why others are saying differently about the food. Definitely a must try."}
{"text":"This was the worst I've ever had. They don't honor the menu .... I ordered 3 gyro platters and it came with just meat and SOGGY fries! No onions, tomatoes, or bread... And the online menu had it ....In all honesty I would never order from here again... Called the issue in because this was a pick up order and it was 3 platters. All they said we will give you 10% off next order... Yeah thanks for saving me a dollar."}
{"text":"I was in the mood to go out for dinner after work instead of going home, and I was getting hungry, so took out my cell, fired up my Yelp app, and scouted for a good local restaurant.  I found one promising tasty Mediterranean fare among other things, less than a mile away, so I made my way over there.  Good thing I didn't \"check in\" before I got to the door--they were closed for \"summer hours\".  Note to newer people in Phoenix--make sure the restaurant you want to go to is open in the evening before beginning the trek!

So I went back to Yelp for another restaurant and now, in the mood for Greek, found another one nearby--practically around the corner.  Crazy Jim's.  Sorry, people.  Despite all the other rave reviews, I can not concur.  

I went in and was seated pretty quickly.  The waitress was pleasant and set me up with some water.  I liked the tables with a design and \"Crazy Jim\" carved into them.  The other diners were real casually dressed with t-shirts and shorts--I felt dressed up with my dress shirt from work!  

Since other Yelpers didn't rave about the hummus, I didn't order that as an appetizer, as it was also several dollars anyway.  There were two calamari salads, one with or without lettuce.  I went with the \"Crazy Calamari Salad\" with shredded cabbage instead of lettuce to try something different.

The good: the pita.  A nice hot basketful of the slightly charred pita came out, which was great, as many places seem to microwave it and then it gets hard.
The not so good: The calamari salad.  I have had a lot of calamari, so I consider myself a pretty good judge of quality calamari.  This was not it.  The calamari was heavily breaded, which may be why it seemed on the greasy side.  The breading wasn't very flavorful, and the calamari could have been a wee bit more tender.  The cabbage was good, the onions plentiful and somewhat sweet.  There was some feta, olives, and pepperoncini, but it was buried under the cabbage and cucumber, so you really had to excavate to find it.  Disclaimer: I'm not a big cucumber fan, so I left a lot of that on my plate.  The oil and vinegar dressing that is on the salad isn't too flavorful--I added some balsamic vinegar that is on the table for extra zip.

Since I really hadn't eaten that much, I had room for dessert.  I inquired about them, and found they don't make their own, but decided to chance it anyway.  The main choices the waitress suggested were a \"capuccino and chocolate mousse cake\" (the menu said tiramisu--was this it?) and baklava.  I decided to try the cake.  A nice moderate-sized piece came out with a blob of white next to it.  The waitress explained that they were trying to serve it with whipped cream, but \"it wouldn't keep its shape, so that kind of ruined the presentation.\"  Uh-huh.  Well, the cake was actually pretty good, but after I finished it, I realized I hadn't noticed much of a coffee taste.  But when I got to the parking lot, I burped, and I tasted it.  And that happened again.  And again.  What?!?!  Did they use coffee flavor or something?  

Okay, so the verdict?  I've been to some other Greek places within a 2 mile radius of this place, as well as elsewhere in Greater Phoenix.  Do yourself a favor and try them--better atmosphere and food.  Unless their specialty is chicken, as some other reviewers seem to be saying."}
{"text":"I'm not usually downtown, but I needed to be for court today, so I came in for breakfast. This place is a gem! Super sweet and friendly staff - the owner is a sweetheart! Food is delicious. Portion sizes are generous and the pricing is very reasonable. The restaurant in general, as well as restroom, is very clean and well kept.
Give this place a try if you haven't already. They don't disappoint!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in here last Saturday morning. Of course not knowing anything about it. And although the server was late because we got there right when they opened. This little gem did NOT disappoint at all. Not only was our breakfest fresh and yummy! The waitress knew right away my tea was watery and brought me fresh brewed. And on top of everything else, they have loyal customers one of which bought us breakfast. Now that was incredible! So the next time you happen to be in there and see this husky polite teddy bear of a policeman! Buy him his meal!!!!! My wife and I have a favorite breakfast place now after 17 years of being here in the Valley."}
{"text":"Gyro was pretty good. I decided to order the one with Feta cheese. Way to much salty cheese and sauce. Staff was awesome and friendly."}
{"text":"Really liked the atmosphere. Hard to find a diner in Phoenix. I had a Denver omelet and my significant other had steak an eggs. Staff was great. Owner came around and touched our table. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in many years.place is looking  dated. Same menu . Ordered their  hi Ken with grilled peppers and onions. Chicken waa a little overcooked  but I love the grilled peppers .We ordered their white pizza with fresh garlic. They still put lots of cheese.the neighborhood  is a little dark.prices is reasonable"}
{"text":"Had very bad experience. My chicken picada had hair wrapped around the chicken and instead of removing the charge for meal they discounted my ice tea. Wrong way to take of a situation. Loss of a regular customer not worth a ten dollar meal. Will never go back. 12/14//2014"}
{"text":"Very friendly. Didn't realize they were already closing when I brought my hungry family in for lunch. They let us in anyways to enjoy a couple gyro platters!"}
{"text":"Read a couple of good reviews on the Chicken Feta Salad so I ordered it. Chicken has a good flavor but the rest of the salad was just ok. Pita Bread and service were excellent. If I come back here, I will definitely order something else."}
{"text":"I went with a friend to catch up. I got the scrimp and mushroom alfredo pasta with lemon chicken soup, and bread. AMAZING.  Massive. IT WAS THREEEEE MEALS! I've been here many times before and hope I'll never stop being blown away!

JUST A NOTE: It is small and maybe seats maybe 30. So if you're wanting to have a group outing, call ahead!!"}
{"text":"AMAZING EXPERIENCE! Walked in with the warmest greeting from the owner! He greets you like you're family! He seated us for lunch right away and we were able to order quickly. Definitely a spot you can get in and out of if you're in a hurry, but we had time and were able to enjoy the lunch. The food came out promptly and was delicious! I got the Gyro Picado salad and it was delicious! Great portions, fresh ingredients and it came with pita bread that was too good to pass up! The owner, Albert, came by a few times and really took the time to talk to us. He was so pleasant! Great food, great service and the owner makes you feel like family the first time you go in! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I eat at Crazy Jim's so often that I call them CJ's. All you Yelper's, they are under NEW MANAGEMENT. I know ALL of the waitresses and get personally greeted by the owner every time I go there. They have the best no lettuce salad you could ever order called the Crazy Salad. It has grilled chicken served over a bed of cabbage with red onions, red and green peppers, cucumbers, tomatoes, kalamata olives and a couple of cubes of feta cheese, with olive oil and vinegar dressing....so delicious, so healthy. If you have not tried Crazy Jim's in a while or previously had a bad experience you MUST GO BACK and try it now. You will LOVE it!!!! Good people, good food and really good prices. A great value for your money...bon appetit"}
{"text":"I had been to Crazy Jim's many years ago. The friend who took me there was a huge fan, and I remember not being super impressed. 
Fantastic Mr. It's Complicated has been singing Jim's praises, and over the weekend I was craving gyros. I asked him to take me, and he did.
Complicated ordered the flaming cheese (saganaki) which was quite tasty.
I had the gyro pita, which comes with choice of fries, salad, pasta salad or lemon chicken soup. I opted for the soup.
The soup was incredibly bland and tasted mass produced. (I have been spoiled by Cypress Pita Grill - theirs is amazing!). The gyro was serviceable. Pita was fresh and tasty, the tzatziki was one of the best I have ever had. The meat? Well, it looked and tasted like gyro meat, and I was hungry - it did the job. Then Complicated pointed out that he once bought a case of gyro meat from Restaurant Depot. And hey - this is the exact same stuff! Looking closer - this was not sliced right of the rotisserie. Every piece was identical in thickness, length and width. And each had perfectly rounded corners. Bah! Why did he have to say that? Now I know Crazy Jim's uses prepackaged frozen gyro meat. Instead of prepackaged frozen gyro meat that's at least put on the rotisserie and sliced just for me. There shouldn't be a difference. But there is. And Jim's drops down on my list. I'll stick with Cypress Pita Grill or Athens Gyros when the cravings hit.
Maybe I'll explore other items on the menu - I like the room - and I adore dining with Mr. It's Complicated - so I'll venture to other items and just stay away from the gyros from now on."}
{"text":"Tuesday was a good news bad news kind of day. Got called for jury duty, but on the bright side, a court room bailiff clued me in to try Crazy Jim's for lunch. And what a lunch! Prompt and friendly service from Lupita who brought me one of the best salads I've ever eaten. An ample sized Spring greens with olives, feta cheese, and a huge slab of salmon topping the meal. Wonderful vinegarette dressing on the side was a real treat. I just wish there were more Crazy Jim's around town. Pass on the franchise foods if your called for jury duty or just downtown on business and head to Crazy Jim's. Other choices range from gyros,burgers, pizza, and all kinds of sandwiches and salads. Friendly too."}
{"text":"Love love love this place!  The pita bread is crazy good and the gyros make me melt!"}
{"text":"Love this place now. The new owner made a huge difference. Lunch special are good deal. The Chicken Feta Salad is the best in the area by far."}
{"text":"I've been searching all over Phoenix ever since moving back here from Los Angeles, CA and finally found the gyro I have been endlessly searching for!

We park in the back of the cute little venue, and notice a sign that says, \"Please do no put feet on the wall\", ummm.. okay.. I'll be sure to keep that in mind..

We walk in, get greeting, order, get served, QUICK!

The food was so delicious. My mouth waters every time I think of this place! If only my stomach could handle it more often I'd be there so much more :)

The place is small, but cute! I didn't mind! The staff was so attentive and nice! Five stars all the way!"}
{"text":"This place used to be really good.  We would walk here often on our lunch break.  Lately it has gone down hill.  BJ at the front is one of the most rude individuals you could put at the register and when you talk to her on the phone to call in an order she's even more rude.  The food also has been terrible.  Their steak sub, cheeseburgers, French fries and pasta salad has become so poorly prepared it's disappointing.  The French fries are always dark brown like the oil they're fried in is extremely old.  The burgers used to be good but now they're disgusting.  Steak sub used to be cubed steak but now it's chipped steak.  And pasta salad is no longer tasty and I once thought it was the best pasta salad ever.  I believe the change in food was to save you money but it won't help your restaurant, nor will the unpleasant BJ.  The food is too over priced for it taste disgusting and cheap now and for the poor service you are faced with when getting take out and having to deal with the miserable and unfriendly BJ.  We are now looking for new places to eat on our lunch break."}
{"text":"Great Pizza and Pitas, these guys are right down the street from work and we bring back lunch to the office about twice a month. Fresh ingredients, lots of cheese, cant go wrong. If you are showing up around lunch 11:30-12:30, it will be busy."}
{"text":"I've heard a lot of good things about this place and while not disappointed. It wasn't as good as the hype per say. The food was hot, fresh and the portions are above average.  It wasn't as flavorful as I had envisioned.  That may may be directly attributable to the fact that my palate is seasoned (I'm from New Orleans originally...'nuff said ). Their prices were more than what would be considered more equal a more upscale dining (Cheesecake Factory, Durants, etc).  By any means this is no shade by me.  So I don't want them to think it is a bad review or me slamming them.  If it was bad, I wouldn't sugar coat it. I'd give them a second chance to improve my rating if asked."}
{"text":"This place is great... I have tried numerous things on their menu and have never been disappointed.  Their Greek salad is excellent... lots of feta and vegetables.  Their subs and pitas are very good too.  I have only had the steak sub and the chicken picato pita.  Watch out for the jalapenos can be very spicy.  Their hummus with pita is also very tasty."}
{"text":"First and foremost a place that has employees and a owners who are very hospitable and welcoming. Me and a friend there for lunch today after a meeting in the downtown area, I ordered the feta gyros pita with fries and my friend ordered the omelette. Both meals had great spices and taste, the food came out quickly which was great. Waitress was super kind and helpful with the menu, I recommend ppl check this place out if you're in the downtown area mon-fri during lunch."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Crazy Jim's this week based on the other reviews. All I can say is that we were crazy for going.  We will not return. The only thing that was good were the pitas."}
{"text":"Everytime i go here I have a great  meal.  Well then again I can't stop ordering the same thing over and over again.  I like to order the gyro picado salad, it comes packed with a lot of gyro meat, great salad with jalapenos.  They have a great variety on their menu, pizza, pitas, picado salads, burgers, etc.  You pretty much can't go wrong with anything you pick on their menu.."}
{"text":"I have a difficult time understanding how this place has a 4-star average. I've been here several times and the food is always very mediocre and the service staff are consistently aloof and uninspired. Worse yet, it's about 20-25% overpriced. The calamari was soggy the 2 times I tried it, the gyros were very unimpressive and the salads are weak as well. This place needs some work and the staff need a wake up call."}
{"text":"After parking in the garage across from the Dodge Theater I followed the \"Restaurant/Bar Open\" sign to Crazy Jim's.  The \"bar\" part is a joke - it's a tiny counter right where you walk in the door, with about 4 stools.  The restaurant has no atmosphere and the food was just so-so.  

There's quite a variety of offerings on the menu, including salads, pita wraps, subs, pizza, and entrees.  However, you will quickly notice that many of the items are exactly the same with one variation, i.e. two subs with chicken and onions but one has cheese and the other has jalapenos.  I asked if I could get the vegetable \"sub\" as a \"pita sub\" and was told that that just wouldn't work.  So I settled on one of the chicken pitas.   

The pita itself was just fine, nothing special.  I expected more of a wrap but it was served open-face and couldn't be held together so I had to use a knife and fork.  The accompanying fries were disappointing - golden brown on the outside but hard/under-fried inside.  

Bottom line: Crazy Jim's is lucky it pretty much has the monopoly of pre-concert eating/drinking within walking distance of the Dodge Theater."}
{"text":"Always return to your roots. So here I am. Haven't been to Crazy Jim's in about 16 yrs because we moved to another part of the valley. I was in the city around Central Ave but I heard Crazy Jim's calling me. Lots of choices  around downtown but I had a craving for Pizza.  OMG the food is still delicious. Pizza, pizza pizza  okay I am a pizza snob, and Crazy Jim's is one of the places that has different and amazing pizza. Sorry to say I ate the whole thing myself and now my jeans are too tight and I feel like a pig but who cares when you're eating something so good.  okay Crazy Jim's is easy to find on the east side of 15th ave with a pretty good parking lot . Would I go back yes, yes yes if it wasn't so far away"}
{"text":"I have walked by this place for 10 years and never stopped in...boy, have I been missing out!  I met a friend here for lunch this week and we both enjoyed the gyro pita with feta and steamed veggies...yum!  The service is not very friendly, but the food seems to make up for it.  Quick, convenient and priced right for a delicious lunch in downtown Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Once again I loved my Chicken Feta Salad,, and The fresh warm Pita bread is to die for,,
You cant get pita bread Made fresh like Crazy Jims.. I am sure thats why they have been around for 30 Years..."}
{"text":"Found this treasure while driving around downtown this morning. Hubby and I had time to kill, so we said why not let's go in there. Boy am I ever glad we did! It's open early at 6:30 am. Plus the parking meters don't require feeding until 8 am!!!!
     I am always leery of coffee at restaurants because it's so weak, it's so blah, and just doesn't have much body. Boy was I surprised at the coffee Albert serves.... It's an organic blend from Farmer Brothers, part of their Artisan Collection called Portland House. It's a medium roast with subtle hints of nutmeg - surprising and yummy!!!
     I ordered their regular breakfast of 2 eggs, American Fried potatoes, bacon, and English Muffin. Imagine my surprise when the food was delivered and the English Muffin was almost too hot to hold, when have you ever gotten a muffin that was not almost cold??? I was sold on Jim's right then and there!!! Plus the bacon was extra crispy as I ordered, and that too was HOT!! Imagine that!!
     The eggs were cooked as requested, over medium, and the potatoes were a great surprise with a nice seasoning and crispy.
     Hubby ordered the Southwestern Omelette. It consisted of REAL eggs, tomatoes, onions, jalapeños, and feta cheese. I was  leery of the feta, thinking it would be too strong, but boy was I wrong!!! There was just enuf to give the omelette flavor, not overpowering the eggs or veggies. It was delicious and hubby loved, loved, LOVED it!!!
     Plus, even his English Muffin was hot, allowing the butter he loves to bathe it in, to melt into every nook and crannie!!! He was a happy \"guest\"
     Speaking of \"guest\", that is what Alberts calls his customers. He explained, we are his \"guests\" and should be treated as such. What a wonderful philosophy!! He is a wonderful, friendly guy who I watched greet his regular \"guests\" with hugs and smiles. And being newbies here, he made a point of welcoming us and we actually chatted for a few, as time allowed him, cuz the place was getting busy!!!
     Albert explains his place as Greek with a bit of Italian! The menu reflects this influence. There are soooo many wonderful entrees we want to try for both breakfast and lunch!!!
     Great place!!!"}
{"text":"On our second shot at Crazy Jim's, we ordered hummus (regular), a meatball sub and the calamari salad. The sub was good. My first time trying the salad, I thought 'peppers and onions' meant they would be raw, but they were cooked with seasoning. Calamari was a tad rubbery, but it was fried so still tasty. Perhaps it was an off night because our hummus was low on flavor. I expected the order of hummus to be a bit larger, it came in two medium taco cups. For me, if this was a $18 meal it would do, but I wouldn't pay $29 for it again. However, the service has been warm and friendly each visit. And the Greek dressing is great!"}
{"text":"I crave the Spring mix Feta Chicken Salad! Definitely recommend it to anyone wanting a really good salad around the area. The creamy Greek dressing along with the delicious fresh pita bread makes me want to go back all the time. There is a reason they have been around for years!"}
{"text":"Love this place - it's perfect in what it is trying to be - a place that has fresh food with a Mediterranean flair - husband and I have this on our list of answers when the question \"what are you in the mood for\" hits and we don't have plans - fast, great ingredients and delicious -"}
{"text":"Best-Friend-At-Work loves this place.
Went for lunch (they have a parking attendant it gets so crazy in that lot!). Fun.

Pita is a little basket of love triangles. Yum.  Greek dressing - get a side of it no matter what you order.

Add jalapeno to whatever you order, not only are they fresh but its grilled just enough to take the edge off but not so much that its limp.  Adds a pop of flavor to every bite.

Gyro salad. Yes. Cukes & Maters are fresh. Feta is moist. Just a very enjoyable lunch overall.  Nice service. They don't rush you even when there is a line at the door.  I'll Be Back............"}
{"text":"One of, if not the best Greek restaurant in town, the Greek feta pita is amazing, I love the salads too, I've been coming here for years and the food and the service never disappoint.  I don't usually eat French fries but I make an exception here....fresh cut and delicious, you don't find that everywhere"}
{"text":"I wanted something different for lunch, so I checked out the menu here and everything looked delicious. I ordered their Crazy Gyro Salad (which has no lettuce)....but man, it was super tasty. Nothing over the top incredible, just darn good food. I gave them an extra star because they were super helpful and extremely nice. Oh, and try their Sangria....very refreshing on a hot afternoon!"}
{"text":"Been coming here since the mid 90's and I am at least there once a week.  I am never disappointing and everything on the menu is my favorite.  The service is always pleasant and the owners are friendly. Top 3 fave restaurants of all time in Phoenix."}
{"text":"This particular location, which I believe is not owned by the same person as the one on 15th avenue is not my favorite. Stopped in for lunch a few days ago and was reminded why I have stayed away. Their food seems to be packaged and heated up rather than prepared. It is amazing the difference between the two locations. The pita bread is dry and seems like something you would buy at a grocery store. I definitely suggest trying the other location, definitely worth the drive and extra time."}
{"text":"I could eat this 3 times a week and never get tired of it. The most amazing Chicken Feta Salad... ever!! Large portions and they do not hold back on the feta! The staff is frendly and amazing, the food is great. I love this place! How could I forget the pita bread... mmmmmmmmmm! This location is my favorite, but is pretty small. Go early and be patient. It is definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"I am just not to crazy about this place.

Some of my friends who work near me took me here saying it was amazing. The full and hard to navigate parking lot I thought may be a indicator that this place was good.

 We had a short crowded wait inside, and then we made it to our table.

I went with a salad as I was told they are the best. However it was mostly just ice burg lettuce, some feta  a few olives and a small bit of pita.

The pita was good, but otherwise my salad felt like a ripoff for $8 and I was still hungry,

I may go back and try the pasta or a pizza but I am in no rush.

Maybe some people are just crazy to liek Jim's?"}
{"text":"A friend and I just ate here last night.  It's been awhile and I was reading reviews for Phoenix Restaurants when I got to CJ's so it made me think about going again.
I love this place.  Not fancy or trying to be something it isn't.  Just great food plain and simple.
The Crazy's are my favorites and whiile I get into a rut with ordering the same thing over and over again - I broke out of my usual \"Crazy Calamari\" or \"Crazy Gyro\" habit (two favorites of mine for years) and ordered the \"Crazy Halibut\"... GEEZ... YUM!
All of the Crazy's come on a big plate with cucumbers, onions, Feta and Pepperocinis and everything is dressed in their salad dressing (which is simple and fresh).  
Did I even mention the Pita?  I can't.. it'll make me wanna go for lunch.  Just try it!"}
{"text":"I used to absolutely love this place as it is close to my work. However, the last two times were such a disappointment I'm not sure I'll be back.  Both times I ordered the Greek Salad lunch special. Apparently the special HAS to include a drink, no price difference id you don't want the drink. Worst of all, the salads were watered down with NO veggies! I could have made myself a better salad. So disappointing because the owner is so nice."}
{"text":"If you're from a part of the country that has Greek diners or small, homey Greek restaurants and you crave that food, this is the place for you. I have to eat lunch here once a week. What it lacks in atmosphere is made up by the warm pita bread, large servings and everything feta. I don't usually eat salads for lunch, just not enough food. However, a salad at Crazy Jim's is a satisfying, delicious meal. The Greek salads can be topped with huge strips of grilled chicken, tasty gyro meat or calamari. The lettuce-free salads, called Crazy Salads, are to die for. The tzaziki sauce is great and most of the combinations in the salads are also be served as pita sandwiches.
Fresh down-home food that never disappoints."}
{"text":"My first experience was a few days ago. I honestly would have never dined here if my friend did not have me tag along. This is one of those times where I can say I am glad I had the opportunity. This west side location is worth the travel. 

What crazy is this place is super tiny. The setup is different but there is plenty of seating. You seat yourself and the wait staff comes immediately to take your drink order. Even though I was not that hungry I still had to try something. The menu had a variety of greek options to choose from  for all food fetishes. I ordered the Chicken Lemon Soup while the server recommend I add some Pita Bread. My friend ordered one of the most amazing salads. As I waited for my food I glanced at the other patrons entrees. I have to say all platers looked amazing. I did not hear a peep out of anyones mouth. My food arrived in a responsible time. It was extremely tasty. The pita bread is probably the best I have ever tasted. Matter of fact I heard they make it fresh. I could go there just to eat that. This is definitely a place I will travel out west for soon. Service with a smile and a belly full of food at this venue."}
{"text":"Went tonight. It rocked. Flaming cheese and Crazy Gyro salad. Service was excellent. Food delicious. Highly recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"Yuuum!! I had the Gyro Feta Pita and it was delicious!! The pasta salad was also great!"}
{"text":"I used to eat here a LOT many years ago, the food was always consistent.  I ordered to go and the food was okay - the delivery guy was super nice, though.  Brought us bottles of water even though we didn't ask.  For future, I think I'll just eat 'there' instead of to-go.  Hoping to change my review next time!"}
{"text":"Hadn't been here for a while, but had walked by later in the day a few times, which reminded me to come back. 

Greek Salad to go, with pita bread. Very tasty. Iced tea added to order for 99 cents. Happy, and full! I'll be back more often."}
{"text":"Anyone who thinks this place has good gyros has not had a good gyro, and I feel bad for them.  Although, getting a good gyro is really not an easy task.  If you are ever in Seattle, go to Mr. Gyro's on Greenwood Ave and you will understand what a good gyro is.

This gyro had meat, tomato and onion.  That is hardly how you make a gyro.  Not to mention the Tzatziki sauce was awful.  The pasta salad was okay.  The lady taking the order -  how do I say this:  Not rude, but almost there.  Not friendly, but not rude, but not exactly chipper.  

This is the kicker:  I saw they had a gyro with pasta for 6.50 (special), so I ordered a gyro. She asked me what side I wanted, so I had her say what the choices were.  She told me soup, pasta salad, fries, and steamed veggies.  So I chose the fries.  She then told me the total was 10 dollars and change.  I was like....what?  She repeated the total.  Changing gears and clarifying it wasn't my hearing that was in question, I asked for further details on why the price jumped 4 dollars with choosing fries instead of the pasta salad.  She told me the pasta salad was on special.  Still not believing this and that there must be more to it, I then asked if the gyro's were the same size, and she said yes.  At this point I was tempted to just cancel the order based on the logic of this restaurant in charging 4 more dollars for a difference between choosing fries vs pasta,and that the gyro was probably going to suck.  Once again I paid for not listening to my intuition!"}
{"text":"Had their pizza, that was awesome.  It was one loaded up with stuff that I can't remember, but it was fab.

Went back tonight and was a tad disappointed in what came with the gyro platter.  Some good places that I've been to put a little medley of things, which it had but was just olives, and those green things that end in cini.  There's a place in Seattle that I have yet to find which compares.  These guys put rice, hummus, feta, olives, tzatziki, and a small greek salad on the side which you can make an awesome wrap with!  And there was more portion for the same price. The meat was good, and everything was good, but I won't order that again.  Seattle's ruined me.  If you are ever in Seattle, you must go to Mr. Gyro's.  I will confidently say that you will not find anyone who makes them better, if so, you got damn lucky!"}
{"text":"Crazy Jim's has always been my destination for lunches in downtown.  The new owner, Albert, is a spectacular host.  The place is always busy due to high demand for quality Greek cuisine. Food and service are always great!"}
{"text":"I was warned by coworkers about this place. I ordered chicken shawarma pita but got the beef one instead. No big deal. They should call it ground beef shawarma. It was very greasy too, it gave me a stomach ache. I won't be back since it's overpriced. I paid nearly $13 for something that I eventually threw away  and that does not include the drink."}
{"text":"I was so impressed by this location. The food was amazing. This is authentic Greek food. The food was fresh and the portions are great. I will def. be going back to try the whole menu. Everything that kept coming out of the kitchen looked delicious. The employees are kind and helpful. My bestie and I sat for a few hours and they were kind and always asking if we needed anything else. 

A must try!!"}
{"text":"I don't recall where I first heard of Crazy Jim's. But when I saw it nearby on Yelp! today, I knew exactly where my girlfriend and I were going to eat lunch.

We enjoy finding out-of-the-way, mom and pop places when eating out. Crazy Jim's has been around for over 30 years and is hidden in plain site on the southeast corner of 15th Avenue and Indian School. Note: It's easier to get to from 15th Avenue and parking is behind the buildings on the corner.

Crazy Jim's is not a huge place. But the staff was extremely friendly and we were seated right away in the front section where it is well lit. It may be tight, but it has a certain charm that makes you forget about the non-descript buildings in the area. And once the food arrives, you will forget you're in Phoenix.

We started our meal, as we typically do at a new restaurant, by sampling the appetizers. I ordered the Roasted Red Pepper Hummus. My girlfriend added an order of Shrimp Scampi. Both are solid choices! The hummus was a generous portion and served with piping hot pita bread. And the scampi was simple and delicious. It was also served with fresh pita bread. Don't forget to soak up the scampi butter sauce with the pita bread!

I've enjoyed some good gyros around town. But the Steak and Feta Gyro I enjoyed today was better than anything I tasted at the last Greek-Fest I attended. The tender steak was cooked perfectly and it melted with the feta cheese, grilled onions and tzatziki sauce. Even though my family isn't Greek, the side of fries reminded me of the homemade fries my mother use to make. This leads me to believe that there is a lot of from-scratch cooking going on in Crazy Jim's tiny kitchen. And when have you ever held pita bread which was too hot to handle?

My girlfriend made a sensible choice by selecting from the very unique \"Not a Salad\" list. It's not a salad because it was made with cabbage. She really enjoyed the grilled chicken which was accompanied by the traditional Greek items (calamata olives, cheese, etc.). Oh, and another serving of their excellent pita bread!

In the end, we were stuffed and had a lot of left overs. Plus, we were very happy that we chose Crazy Jim's over a popular chain that isn't too far from here. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Food is good, basically its a repetition of the same foods w/ different names or ingredients added (or taken off). Prices are a bit high for the meals and quality of service. 

The service during lunch is fast, however once you get your meal, you will be ignored by the waitstaff. Make sure to bring a spritzer of perfume or cologne, because you'll be smelling like food when you come out."}
{"text":"Quality went down. Their curry lentil is TERRIBLE! It's like curry chicken without the chicken or anything else, just liquid. I called up and apparently it's supposed to be like that. I'm sorry but that is NOT curry lentil. The chicken feta salad is still decent but it is smaller now. I liked the vinaigrette that had seasonings in it and now its just oil and vinegar. I haven't had their pita sandwiches yet. I usually get the chicken feta pita but at this rate I probably will just save my money. The staff was nice and attentive before. The occasional new girl would suck but overall good service. I'm not sure about now. Haven't ate in yet because their prices are ridiculous!"}
{"text":"Crazy Jim's is one of those old-standby places.  The service is typically always stellar and the foods you enjoy are always of the same quality.  I don't go too often, but when I do, I'm always happy I did.

I've only had a couple things on the menu: the teropita appetizer, the steak pita, the jalapeño burger, and the pepperoni pizza.  You can't go wrong with the teropita.  The soft, chewy dough is filled with a delicious egg and cheese mixture and is to die for.  I highly recommended you start you meal with this.  The steak pita is wonderful and what I always order - tender beef, grilled peppers, mozzarella, and grilled onions (which I always omit) on a wonderfully soft and delicious pita.  With it, I order a side of fried.  Do yourself a favor and order the fries extra crispy.  You won't be sorry!  The jalapeño burger is actually really great.  I don't know where they get their jalapeños, but they are always wonderfully spicy, sometimes EXTREMELY spicy, and always super fresh.  My only disappointing meal here has been the pizza.  I ordered it on a whim one day and was VERY disappointed.  I'm guessing it was an off day, as I've heard others rave about the pizza.  It didn't help that I found a hair on my first slice.  The waitress was very apologetic.  Not only did she comp my meal and offer to have something else made (I'd lost my appetite by then) but she also offered to give me a free meal on a future visit.  I declined the free meal, as I didn't feel it was necessary and knew I'd  be back again, but that went a long way.

This place is pretty small and gets busy during lunch and dinner time, so plan to go early or late.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Strike 3 on these folks! I have NEVER been in this restaurant and received the kind of service any normal person would expect. 

My previous visit, the party I was with and I ordered and did not receive food for 45 minutes. Other tables around us arriving after we did received orders and left before we ever received food. Food was luke warm upon receipt. Late getting back to work. 

Today placed phone order, was given price and said it would be ready in 15 minutes. Arrived twenty minutes later and they claimed order was never placed. Waited another 15 minutes to get order and was charged $5 more than phone order quote. Got blank stare and shoulder shrug when questioning price. Late getting back to work. I ordered the chicken piccado salad, salad was mostly lettuce and short on premium ingredients. Certainly no where near worth the $11 I was charged for it. 

I don't know about Jim but I must be crazy giving these people yet another chance! No more, I am quite done."}
{"text":"Was in the area and depended on yelp for our lunch decision being that crazy Jim's Greek had 4 stars and so many reviews we decided to give it a try... Well it was ok! Service was good, the food was just ok! Their menu was basically fried foods and or a ton of salad options a few calzones and subs nothing we think of when you think Greek... No cabbage, or eggplant... Shit we ordered a Greek salad and when it arrived I was surprised to see the lack of feta,olives and yellow peppers! I asked why the salad was missing all the typical Greek toppings and was told their Greek salad didn't come with it:/ what? Ok well I asked for it and $3 later I had a Greek salad:/ not sure if they've had a billion people say the same or need them too, but note to crazy Jim's greek salads come with feta, olives and peppers as well without $3 upcharges!!! Anyways we won't be back mainly because we live over an hour away, but second if we do come back in the area we wouldn't return because it just wasn't that good!"}
{"text":"I was in a hurry one late afternoon and craving a salad. Luckily, Crazy Jim's was nearby to save me! 

Housed in an older building, Crazy Jim's is in a so-so neighborhood, and while I felt comfortable walking from the back parking lot alone, I probably wouldn't do so after dark. It's a small place with wooden tables (carved with Crazy Jim's logo) situated rather close to one another. Luckily I was there late afternoon and didn't need to deal with a large lunch or dinner crowd. 

I had the basic Greek salad with home made creamy Greek dressing. I'm often disappointed by salad dressing, but not this time...it was great! The portion size was large enough for an entree, but could suffice for two or more to share as a side. Many restaurants skimp on everything but iceberg, but this salad had several pieces of kalamata olives and the feta was piled high! 

The highlight of the meal had to be the pita. Served warm and cut into quarters, it was probably the most flavorful I've ever had! Too bad I didn't ask for extra to go. 

My server was fast, friendly and knowledgeable; so helpful with questions I posed about menu items. Speaking of which, since I've sampled so little of it, I'll be back to try the gyro pita and a few others I expect I will love!"}
{"text":"My review falls along the line of many others. First let me say our waitress was pretty bad. She wasn't exactly rude but she had no personality/life to her. You might as well have a robot taking orders. She also gave us the wrong check which caused some confusion at the front. 

I ordered the pita gyro. It was a little plain but I could work with it. I was hungry and ate it. I'll give that 2.5 stars. My coworkers ordered burgers and they looked like dry, frozen patties. None of them enjoyed the burgers. I also ordered a small side salad. It was basically iceberg lettuce with dressing. Plain and boring. Also, almost every item is $10, so if you aren't starving and want something small, you're going to pay the same as everyone else. I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Love this place!

While working close by about 10 years ago, some co-workers suggested lunch at Crazy Jim's. I took my family a few times and they liked it too. We lived in Tempe, so it fell off our radar for awhile, but now it is back to regular visits and we've shared the secret with a few others...and we moved to SE Chandler and still go!

Baked feta is a great appetizer. I don't know what brand of feta they use, but it's creamy and fabulous. Their pita are just the best - I dream about their deliciousness. Soft on the inside, served warm with a toasty exterior. Yum! We often get the flaming cheese as well - a favorite with the kids. 

We like the chicken feta pita, the Ellen pizza, the pasta with mushroom sauce is delicious, salads are good. Don't pass up on the olive oil bread or the homemade taziki sauce. 

This place rocks. It's a small restaurant but the food they serve, they do quite well."}
{"text":"I was a patron - no, friend - of this restaurant for 21 months while working on a project in downtown PHX. I chose to come here almost every day, twice a day, for breakfast and lunch. The only thing better than the food is the feeling of family the owner and staff provide. Albert and his staff* work hard to deliver consistently great food, and to remember and value their patrons. 

Must Haves:
Breakfast - steak burrito, or anything that comes with green sauce (very spicy!) and their house breakfast potatoes. 
Lunch - chicken picado pita and taboulleh. Oh, the taboulleh! I'm making some now just because I miss it. 
Anytime - feta tomato fries. 

*I'd name them, but am sure I'd forget someone

Love, love, love this place."}
{"text":"Deliciously prepared pita bread, meat all cooked to perfection, and drinks refilled fast. Will definitely be coming back here."}
{"text":"Uh-May-Zing!

This Greek restaurant checked every box:
Great service
Delicious food
Terrific prices
Unique atmosphere

If youre looking to go out to eat and keep it light simple with no need to dress to impress this is a great place to go."}
{"text":"underscore the tastiness of the pita bread. so, so good. i was really sad when i realized i had finished my gyro feta pita.

french fries are really, really good. that's probably not why you would come here, but those little bonuses are memorable.

i also had a side salad and the dressing was unlike any greek dressing i've had before-slightly creamy, not to heavy, not too acidic. 

yum.

oh, very small dining area so you might want to call them if you've got a larger group."}
{"text":"Love the ambience hete. If you try anything, lemon soup, pasta, gyros, burgers, to die for. The Sistas got it goin on here. Been going here 22 years"}
{"text":"I was at Karate Mart next door buying some shoes and saw this place so I gave it a try.

The hummus is decent.  2-stars.  They add paprika in it so it has a slight reddish color.  It didn't have the taste I like so I ate a little bit and took the rest home.

The gyro feta salad is a solid 4-stars.  The gyro meat is very good, very soft, moist and had deep flavor.  4.5 stars for the gyro.

Service is very nice and friendly.  However the customers here seem really unhappy when they are eating.  Just about all the customers were like that, in a pissy, whining, or upset mood.  It's not a good idea to eat food when you feel that way.  This place is not recommended for a date.

Get food to go if you are in the area and need good, decent quality mediterranean food."}
{"text":"I can't say I'm in the western avenues a lot, but in the future, whenever I make my way due west, I'll know where to get my Mediterranean fix! Crazy Jim's is hidden on 15th Avenue just south of Indian School. It's unassuming and you could easily drive right past it and never know the difference. But, take my advice and find time to stop in. You won't regret it. 

While in between meetings today, Gabi M introduced me to Crazy Jim's and I'm sure glad she did! We were seated by the friendly hostess in the narrow restaurant. Our drinks were brought out within minutes. We started with a side of hummus and pita bread and I opted for the Greek salad with chicken. I was told the dressing on the salad is excellent. 

The hummus came out in a bowl and the pita bread was fresh and warm. The hummus didn't have a ton of kick to it, but it still had the creamy hummus taste so it satisfied my chickpea craving. So here is where I shed some light on the concept of a salad from Crazy Jim's. Holy moly salad size! I think they gave me an entire chicken breast on the top of a salad of greens, tomatoes, olives, feta cheese and onions. The salad dressing came on the side and was creamy, delicious and definitely not low-cal (but I don't care)! The meal was hearty but not overly filling. I liked how the salad was hefty enough that I definitely didn't leave hungry for more. 

So in summary, there's nothing crazy about Jim's except the fact that they are crazy about their food and getting it right! The next time I find myself on 15th Avenue, I'll know where to go."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant by far!! 

The restaurant is on the small side, it usually gets crowded during lunch, but so worth the wait! 

The crazy chicken salad is amazing!!

My first stop when I go back home"}
{"text":"Everything was excellent. I had an omelet with bacon, home fries and a Coke and it was delicious and affordable. The employees were friendly, and the atmosphere was great.
I will definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Yum!!! Had chicken Cesar salad and a gyros plate. Delish!!! Phenomenal fries too! Is a bit squishy and small so I wouldn't go during prime lunch times as I'm not sure how long the wait would be but do definitely go!!!"}
{"text":"I would have never guessed this place had such great food from the outside.  I ordered a Crazy Chicken Salad and it was so delicious and fresh and big!  The service was great.  The hummus was good, but too pricey.  I wish they had some other Mediterranean selections, like chicken schwarma or kabobs.  And it'd be nice if they had some booth seating rather than just tables, but I'm definitely going back for another crazy salad!"}
{"text":"Best pita bread IN THE VALLEY! I crave the pita bread enough to make me order a salad (a basket of it comes as a side with a salad) and their Ranch dressing is tasty (Hidden Valley packet tasty). 

My go-tos are: the goat cheese (with spring greens) or the gyro feta salad. Salads are around $10 but pretty filling.

Non-pita lovers can get burgers or pizza :)"}
{"text":"I inadvertantly went to the Washington location online menu tonight when I was trying to decide what to order and discovered that the prices at that location are between $1.50 and $2.00 more per item. I completely understand the need to have higher prices to cover the location costs, but am even more pleased that this location is closer to my home."}
{"text":"The food is great! They have been here since 1985. I get the steak and mushroom pita with a side of fries. They make home made pita in house. My other favorite dish is the crazy gyro salad with olive and vinegar --- chopped up extra gyro.

So great!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza and one of the best salads I have enjoyed in a long time. The chicken was really good and the surprise ingredients in the salad were roasted bell pepper and jalapenos...lots of them. Every bite was super fresh. The service was great too. I can't wait to go back and try everything on their extensive menu!"}
{"text":"The new ice coffee is awesome. The chicken feta pita delicious with the chicken lemon soup. This place gets better all the time and happy hour!!!"}
{"text":"Been going to this place for years.  Best Pitas in AZ.  Salads are great too. Pizza is good and the homestyle frys are also great!  Don't go during the lunch rush hour!  It gets crazy!"}
{"text":"My friend and I had lunch at Crazy Jim's today. He had the chicken piccado salad - it looked good with the grilled chicken and peppers on it, and I had a traditional gyro and fries. They were really nice and let me substitute lettuce and cucumbers for tomato and onion. My food was delicious. My gyro was a tad greasy but was overflowing with meat and vegetables. I had to eat some of it with a fork before I could pick it up. The fries tasted fresh. It was a great value for the price.

I have two quibbles about this place:
1. The service was a bit slow, which was surprising given how busy it was and how close it is to City Hall and the court houses. 
2. It's loud in there, and the noise issue is made worse by how close together the tables are."}
{"text":"I finally made it back to Crazy Jim's... and just as I remembered, it was crazy delicious!

I was taken to Crazy Jim's for the first time when I moved here several years ago... and I remember it being somewhere on the avenues downtown - obviously, I didn't know my way around the Valley yet.  Now I'll never forget where CJ's is located; it's easy - on 15th Ave just south of Indian School!

Upon entering, it's easy to tell that CJ's has been around for a long time - it's comfortable, casual, and packed during lunchtime; filled with regulars I would assume.  (I'd be a regular if I lived or worked closer to the location.)

I can only write about their salads and pita bread, but that's enough for me... the pita is pitalicious - I could eat the whole basket if I weren't so carb conscious.  It's sweet and savory and served warm and oh... so good!  The feta they use in the salads tastes like it's straight from the dairy farm; it melts in your mouth.  I have to explore the other menu options one day, and I have a feeling they won't disappoint.

I definitely will not wait so long to return to Crazy Jim's!"}
{"text":"Did not get to eat in as they were packed when lunch was catered at work their pita bread was nice and warm-delishus!"}
{"text":"Mmmmmmmm Saganaki!

This place is a very good value, delicious really!
Kind of a cute little dive with AMAZING food.

This place makes me think of a few close friends who brought me there.
Good times! Good place!"}
{"text":"Crazy Jim's catered a lunch meeting I attended while in Phoenix, and I was so completely mesmerized by this amazing pizza that I barely paid attention to the meeting.  Remember Sbarro's? That's what this pizza reminded me of; giant, plate-sized slices of cheese and grease...mmmmm.   I would go back to Phoenix solely for more pizza."}
{"text":"I work next to the federal court house and love when I get a chance to eat at Crazy Jims. It always smells great when you walk in. I love Greek food... completely obsessed with gyros. So this is the perfect spot for me.

My favorite thing about Jims is the pita bread. It's kind of crispy yet soft, and dipped in their creamy greek dressing it is like a dream. My favorite menu item here is the Gyro Salad. Basically like a gyro but not wrapped up, pita bread on the side. The feta is fantastic, crumbled perfectly. Nothing better than warm gyro meat smothered in feta cheese, topped with creamy greek dressing. I'm not going to think about the consequences of a dish like this, it just wouldn't be fair. I'll eat and think later.

Great service and great food. Will be a long-time customer. Hope I work downtown forever :-)"}
{"text":"With the attitude that the staff has with their customers, I'm not sure how they've been in business this long. Their food is good but the times that I have gone there the customer service is pretty horrible to say the least. The kid that runs the pick up counter not once, not twice but every singe time throws the receipt at me. No thank you, no smile, no nothing! Horrible service from the entire staff!!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Crazy Jim's for at least 12 years and it is one of my favorite spots for anything Feta. I have probably had every item on the menu throughout this 12 year relationship and have never had anything I did not like. Here are my top 5: 

1. Gyro Feta Pita (loaded with gyro meat, onions, tomatoes, and feta)
2. Spring Mix Chicken Feta Salad (Enough to feed two people)
3. Calamari Feta Salad (Crunchy and tasty) 
4. Penelope Pizza (Chicken and Artichoke)
5. Fresh Warm Pita Bread (a must have)

The restaurant is cozy, casual, clean, and the staff is very friendly and prompt.  

I have tried other Greek restaurants in Phx that have either been way to gimmicky or a total bust and none compare to Crazy Jim's. If anything ever happened to this place I would go \"CRAZY\"!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Yum! What the hell are they putting in the food/pitas here? It must be jesus-sauce or crack-sprinkles. 

My best guy friend who lives a block away and I ventured over for lunch today and hotdamn, we were not prepared for what we had.

As soon as we walk in we look over to our right and see a massive, sexy, salad topped with beef, feta, veggies and peppers. I think our simultaneous heart-flutters could be heard, as the couple looked up at us and smiled. We were seated quickly, which surprised me given the tiny dining area and it being prime lunch rush time (12:30pm). Our hostess wasn't the most cheery, upbeat girl I've had the pleasure to be seated by, but it was quick and no nonsense so no big deal there.

Our drinks came out quick and we didn't feel over pressured due to our indecisiveness, our server was very polite while checking every 4-5 minutes to see if we'd made our selections. It took us a few checkups but we made our decisions and we eagerly anticipated the coming fury of gyro and beef via pita and salad. Our meals came out quite quickly (around 7-8 minutes) and we were not disappointed. 

The fries I received with my Gyro Picado Pita were the thin oil fried type and with a light salting (and peppering) they were delicious. My dining mate's salad looked great as he picked pita pieces and went to town with gusto. No complaints from his side of the table. Also, we had several refills on drinks that were quick and did not interrupt our feast.

My pita sat for a few minutes while I chowed my fries down, as I like to savor them hot, and I immediately regretted not delving into the gyro sooner. I probably didn't even need my tzatziki as the peppers, jalapenos and gyro meat were all perfectly tasteful. I usually try to keep my portions smaller, but there was absolutely no chance of that happening, I took down the pita in probably a minute and a half flat.

We got a box for leftover salad. Check came out quick and was returned quick. All in all, a great experience. Quick, filling, delicious and well priced."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my two co-workers. Parking can be a little bit crazy but they do have parking in the back. The soup chicken lemon orzo is fantastic it's a must get!  I got the chicken pita with fries. It was very delicious and of course the sauce made the pita sandwich. Service was also on par. The place can get packed very fast as well."}
{"text":"I had the Saganaki Chicken Salad.

It was a good salad, with Greek cheese, and chicken that was cooked perfectly. The salad part was plentiful, except it would have been nice to have more than one little strip of bell pepper. We had to ask for pepperoncini because it was missing. The pita bread served on the side was soft and cut into strips - you're served what looks like half a small pita, but it was plenty.

Overall, the salads in my party were decent, although a little uninspired. Next time. I'll try another dish. The place was doing great business, and the waitresses were prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were hungry and wanted to try something new, so we hopped on the netbook and fired up Yelp. We tried Crazy Jim's, and boy was this a good pick. When we 1st rolled up to CJ's my girl was like \"I don't know about this!!!\" I said \"lets just go in and take a look, if it is clean inside then lets try it\". Once inside the place was small but quaint and most important it was CLEAN. So I ordered a veggie pita and got the pasta salad as a side. The food was ready pretty fast and I had envisioned something like a sandwich that you pickup and eat but it was all laid out over my plate. The pita was very good and I give a big thumbs up to, the pasta salad was kinda plain. My girl has a greek salad and she liked it but wasn't too crazy about the dressing. I would definitely go back to Crazy Jim's and eat. As a matter of fact anytime I am craving that veggie pita, your boy \"E\" will come to visit. 

ps. Our server was great also, friendly, fast and helpful."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite lunch spots and I was fortunate to be able to meet my friend Cheryl here for lunch on Monday. We arrived at 1:00 (which you have to either get here very early or kind of late at lunch as they get packed!) and almost had the place to ourselves which was nice. The waitress was very friendly and took our drink orders while we decided on what to order. It was a hard decision for me as I usually get the shrimp pasta with the feta/butter sauce but I decided to be different this time and ordered the Calamari salad with a side of fried goat cheese. Their salads are huge and this one was no different!  It was simply delicious with so much fried calamari, fresh vegetables, and other goodies that I didn't hardly need any of their homemade blue cheese dressing (that I just love!) to eat with it. My friend had their grilled Salmon salad and the piece of salmon that came with it was a very good sized piece that was cooked perfectly. They serve their salads with a basket of grilled pita bread and I was so stuffed that I ended up taking quite a bit of my salad with me to finish up a little later at work.  I will definitively be back!!"}
{"text":"Began with feta and olives and a flaming cheese dish that was so tasty. I had the salmon piccata salad and it too was delicious.  My wife had the steak piccata salad. Most of the other guests had a pita of one kind or another and there was way too much to eat. I heard that one of my friends ordered the artichoke pizza that was delicious."}
{"text":"The downtown outpost of Crazy Jim's has never disappointed. it's hard to label the type of food at this place. But it's good for groups, because you can choose from among various mediterranean items, burgers, pizza and more. Kind of a diner with a Greek slant.

It's not fancy, just solid delicious food. The pitas rule, whatever you stuff in them. Their gyro meat is flavorful, tender and not dried out. Surprisingly, the made to order pizzas are really good too. A thicker crust than I enjoy anywhere else, but damn good.

My favorite thing is their steak meat on a pizza. It's like chewing up an italian beef sammich with red sauce, and spitting it onto a pizza stone. That probably doesn't sound as good as it tastes.

If you haven't explored the menu yet, you should."}
{"text":"I love Crazy Jim's.  Their menu is quite extensive, affordable, good portions, and the food is flavorful.  I always get the calamari picado salad and it is enough to feed at least two people.  They also give you pita bread and it is toasted just right."}
{"text":"So glad I joined my co-workers to lunch at Crazy Jim's! First visit, and I enjoyed their Gyro Picado Salad. I have never given 5 stars for a salad, but being that this was the best salad I've ever had in a restaurant, a 5 star rating is deserved! My salad had tender cuts of gyro meat bursting with flavor over a crisp bed of romain lettuce, grilled onions and jalapeños - perfect flavor combination. I watched other dishes come out of the kitchen, and all looked incredible - falafas, pitas, Greek salads, pizzas, etc. While the prices are not what I would consider to be lunch special prices, the quality, flavor, and freshness of the food makes it worth it. What a treat and a great place to eat!"}
{"text":"Crazy Jim's is a lesson in not judging a book by its cover. It's small and hidden away, but it's definitely worth finding. The salads here are so delicious! Do yourself a favor and try any of the salads preceded by the word \"Crazy\". They are no-lettuce salads consisting of mountains of cabbage, cucumber, onion, and tomatoes with a light oil and vinegar dressing and topped off with huge chunks of feta and the meat of your choice. My fav is the Crazy Gyro, which is pretty self-explanatory. Plus, all of the salads are served with their pita bread. Bonus - the pita bread is fantastic! Try any of their pitas if you're not in the mood for salad, you won't regret it. My sister also swears by their pizzas. The Ellen is her preference - white sauce, chicken, cheese and spinach on a pita bread crust.  Seriously, is there anything that their pita bread can't make delicious?"}
{"text":"I was told this place was good and decided to give it a shot. The blonde woman who took my order at the take out register was very icy and treated me as if they were paying me to eat there.

After telling her \"no onions\" on my gyro and her repeating \"ok, no onions\" I get my food 10 minutes later and yep, onions all over it. I reminded her that said no onions on the gyro and she proceeds to look me I'm the face and say \"I didn't hear you say no onions\".

She then asks the cooks to make another gyro because, and I quote, \"he now says he doesn't want onions on it\".

Once I received my food the gyro was soggy, as if the pita was wet. The veggies were average.

I believe in supporting local businesses but I'm never going back. The service was bad and the food was average. I can deal with average food if the experience was pleasant and the environment was welcoming, but that wasn't the case today.

Save yourself the hassle and skip this place. You'll be treated with contempt and receive subpar food.....late."}
{"text":"Visited here for my favorite \"to go\" again today. Steak Feta salad with ranch dressing (extra) and an extra pita. Tip to the cashier and off I go. Parking's always a little tight but pull around to the back and you should find something close!"}
{"text":"I don't stop in often, maybe once every two months or so since it is in walking distance from my job, and it is my go to destination for breakfast or lunch when I forgot mine at home ( or want to treat myself). The owner is genuinely friendly, warm and welcoming. I get that \"don't you want to go where everyone knows your name\" kind of vibe from him. He makes you feel special by commenting on how long you've been haven't visited or suggesting something new to try than your usual that you might love just as much. My usual is the Feta and Tomato Fries. I love the way they are prepared. Very filling! So much so I've tried recreating the recipe at home with some success but still missing that Crazy Jims flair. Lunch time is always crazy packed so I call ahead for pickup. Would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I moved from Phoenix a number of years ago, and all I can say is that I STILLLLLLLLLLL pine away for the grilled chicken feta salad.  Jeeez, that is one helluva great salad.  The chicken was always flavorful and moist, with lotsa feta cheese, cucumber, kalamata olives, lettuce and tomatoes....and an AWESOME dressing.  The pita bread is to-die-for.......so soft, warm and utterly delicious.  I haven't had it in years, but it was so good, and I'm sure STILL IS, I just had to say something.  I know I will be returning there when I get back to Phoenix."}
{"text":"Not sure how the downtown restaurant is but skip the 15th Ave location.  Tried it for the first time and ordered a steak sandwich.  When i got it home and opened it the cheese was sitting on top, not even melted and nobody even toasted the roll.  Seems like they could use some better kitchen management."}
{"text":"They are usually decent.  Today they forgot to put sauce on my Pizza or had so little I  couldn't see it even when I lifted the cheese.  I asked for another and was polite.  The table next to me was laughing and joked with me about it.  I had to leave without eating there and had a cold soggy pizza back at the office. They weren't busy  we were very early.  I go there enough, I'm more than ticked off."}
{"text":"For now, Crazy Jim's gets 3 stars. That's a fair, middle of the road rating for a decent restaurant. Apparently, I didn't realize it was a Greek restaurant, so what do I do? I order a Ham and Pineapple calzone. It wasn't the best I've had but it was still pretty good. My lunch companion ordered a gyro with a side of pasta salad, and I have to say that it looked better than my meal and cost about three dollars less. I tried the salad and the abundance of feta made it taste great. 

Other menu items include subs, pasta and salads (with or without lettuce. All the breads and crusts are made fresh daily on site.

My only complaints with this restaurant are that it's very, very small. So small that I noticed a table pushed entirely into the back corner so that only two chairs on the exposed sides could be seated at it. Also, I was quite literally back to back with the gentleman dining at the table behind me. It was also fairly busy (which speaks well for them and their business) and difficult to hear what my friend was attempting to tell me. Oh well, I doubt it was very important anyway...

If I go back to sample the Greek fare, I may be tempted to add a star but until then, this rating is based primarily on my choice of entree."}
{"text":"We popped in to Crazy Jims last night before a concert at Comerica.

At first glace at the front door it looked like a counter diner, as we didn't notice the large dining room on the side. The big room was a nice surprise! It wasn't a beautiful space, it looks very efficient, and kind of like a corporate cafeteria dining room.

About the efficient part, the staff certainly was!!!! when we were seated the restaurant was at about 25% full and by the time we left the lobby was packed with people waiting for tables. What impressed me so much was the team work going on here, there was never a service misstep and nobody looked frazzled as the restaurant quickly filled. The kitchen held its own as well as everything we ordered was tasty fresh and hot.

JIM if you are reading this thank your lucky stars that you have such a crew!!!! You have a team most restaurateurs only dream about."}
{"text":"Omg! The Gyro with jalapeños will change your life! I stopped by here on my lunch break after seeing so many great reviews! I LOVE this place! It's a tiny hole in the wall with excellent food, great service and lots of character! Just an all around excellent spot to get Yo Greek On!!!"}
{"text":"I've been eating here for 22 years so that should say enough. Best pizza, try the Ellen, to DIE for! I love the vibe here, small, friendly and the kitchen is spotless."}
{"text":"Crazy Jim's is one of those places that all the \"in\" people know about.  It has been around for ages and has probably been packed each night since the day they opened.

They have several locations, but this is the one I like best.  The atmosphere is Mediterranean-casual. It's the kind of atmosphere I love that reminds me of past adventures in remote corners of Athens, or or little hole in the wall places on the Spanish coast.  For those who don't travel, that means the tables are Formica topped and too close to a noisy kitchen, the aisles are small to non-existent, and the the lighting is an inconsistent no-frills kinda thing that leaves people in one room struggling to read the menu while those in the other room are wishing for sunglasses.  I've seen bigger bathrooms in motor homes.  The only thing missing is the European coffee that no one seems to be able to imitate here. Or maybe they just don't want to.

The menu is big enough for anyone to find a favorite.  They have traditional Greek salads with and without lettuce, pizzas of all varieties, pasta, gyro (pronounced yeer-o) platters and sandwiches, and fantastic calamari.  Dishes are big enough to split, and the pita bread is soft, and fresh off the grill."}
{"text":"1.00 for onions and 1.00 for peppers (total 2.00) to add them to an omelettte? What other gouge items are hidden?"}
{"text":"I don't get the hype.  Sure the pita bread is good, the produce is fresh, the portion sizes are large and the service quick,  but I found the overall experience to be nothing more than mediocre.  The gyro was bland, the feta and olives were nothing more than grocery store passable, and the seasoning was non-existent.

Perhaps I am overly critical, having eaten at great Greek restaurants in other cities (I've noticed that ethnic places - Mexican aside - are over rated across the board in Phx), but as a 'Greek' restaurant this place falls flat.  However, as it is a change from the ordinary casual dining venues, and is close to home, I'll likely be back, but next time I'll choose the pizza or pasta, (with a side of pita) as the Greek and 'Crazy' salads did nothing for me."}
{"text":"Best place ever!! I have been going to eat the white pizza and its always DELICIOUS!!  Super  yummy and i have tried others but nothing luje this one. My family and I have been going there since 1992 . Luv it"}
{"text":"Such tasty food and such an eclectic menu!! Small dining area and limited parking but so worth the trip and any wait."}
{"text":"Not bad!! Good value for the price and the my breakfast burrito was really good!! It came with hash browns for less than $6."}
{"text":"I love Crazy Jim's on 15th Ave!  Great Flaming Cheese, Giros, salads, spaghetti, pizza...and everything on the menu!  It's a great find.  It's become our \"go-to\" place when we can't male our minds up!"}
{"text":"Nice for the price. I usually get one of three things when I go here: soup and salad combo, the gyro with feta, or a Greek salad. The chicken lemon soup is tasty but I think the lemon flavor and amount of orzo has been lacking the last couple of times I went. 

My niece has had the cheese pizza, which she liked. As for the pasta...I just wish that for a Greek restaurant, they had something more than Italian versions. It's not bad and the portions are hefty but I could jut go to an Italian American restaurant for spaghetti with meatballs.

I do like their baklava! The portions are huge! On my last visit, I saw they've recently started serving breakfast on Saturdays (8 to 10, I think)."}
{"text":"We were on our way to taco Tuesday when this place caught our eye. We started reading Yelp reviews and turned around to give it a try. Everything was delicious!  We had the saganaki which was great and the portion was sizable. Also had the calamari and a gyro pita. With the homemade, yes HOMEMADE, pita bread we could have stopped at the appetizers. Beer selection was good and reasonably price. We'll be back for sure. What a find!"}
{"text":"The spicy humus was great (very spicy) yummy! I had the calamari salad as well, very impressed :) Ordered take-out, everything was delievered in a timely manner."}
{"text":"Sorry, Crazy Jim.  While your place is a popular lunch spot with downtown workers, the food is average Greek fare, at best. Had a Chicken Patra Pita. Average pita, stuffed with average chicken, grilled onions, peppers and cheese, accompanied by an undistinguished pile o' lettuce. Next time I'll try somewhere else."}
{"text":"An excellent little breakfast and lunch spot in downtown Phoenix. Just the pita bread alone is worth it. It's the best I've had. No need for anything to dip it in, I would almost feel guilty if added any more flavor to the party. 

I stopped in Crazy Jim's this morning desperately needing to fill my stomach with some much needed breakfast. I ordered up a Gyro Omelet to go. How awesome is that! And it's only $3.75.  While the presentation of the omelet itself wasn't much to look at, the eggs, feta, onion, tomato, and Gyro meat all go together perfectly. The hash browns were an okay side, but nothing special. The bread, as I already stated, was phenomenal. 

I've been in Crazy Jim's a couple other times. The prices for lunch are quite high, but the food is really good. As one of my coworkers puts it; Crazy Jim's has the best salads, but it's only something you can afford on payday.

This is the perfect place to treat yourself once in a while if you work downtown."}
{"text":"The food is Good!!!! The service stinks though, they are SO SLOW! I don't know why it takes close to an hour to make my friends and I some chicken pitas at lunch. Ridiculous!"}
{"text":"Their breakfast is amazing! And the owners are always so friendly! Staff is also very friendly! I go here once a week usually for breakfast and I'm never disappointed! Their breakfast potatoes are some of the best I've ever had! They also have amazing coffee! I get the Hawaiian Hazelnut and it is tasty! I would recommend this place for breakfast to anyone! I haven't tried their lunch yet but breakfast is to die for!"}
{"text":"Last year I would've given this place 5 stars.  I really like this place. Their food is really good, especially the crazy calamari salad.  But my hub and I went there for lunch yesterday and both of us noticed the change in portions.  Back in the day we could only order an appetizer and a crazy salad.  The portions were big enough we could share and be perfectly fed without being too full.  So yesterday we began our lunch with our normal ordering style and when the food came we realized the portions were so much smaller that we had to order more food.  We also noticed the plates and serving platters were smaller.  Clearly Crazy Jim has decided to deal with the crappy economy by giving patrons less food and charging the same price.  The food was still very tastey.  The service was still fair (never been great).   But as the ecomomy is hitting us too, we decided Crazy Jim's has now been moved from the \"Awesome Crazy Deal\" category, to the \"Maybe if I have a craving\"  category.     
Bummer."}
{"text":"Crazy Jim's probably has the best calamari salad ever! I've been here 4 times already and always with my good friend Sage.
This hole-in-the-wall joint serves up some outstanding greek fare. It's a small family owned restaurant serving delicious food with a friendly smile. I'm not too crazy about the parking lot being too close to the dumpster, but the food and service is really good."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place for almost two years now and my hubby since the 90s and after today I'm not sure we will be back. The new server took awhile just getting us water and then when the food came out my salad had some very old lettuce I couldn't even eat it. She never came back to ask us how the food was or to bring a bill. We got up walked to the front and she was so shocked to see us lol well not everyone has time to sit around and waste! Not happy at all!"}
{"text":"I have finally found my new favorite place for hummus. Stopped in this place last month for a quick lunch. We started with the hummus. It was perfect. Not too watery, not too chunky. The pita bread was fresh and delicious as well. 

For lunch, I ordered the chicken caesar salad. Unlike some salads, there was plenty of chicken. The dressing was great as well. 

I only wish that I was in this area more often, but next time I am craving some hummus, I know where I will be going!"}
{"text":"Ugh their food is so mediocre and overpriced, but what's a guy to do when he needs a quick lunch? I can't imagine anyone truly enjoys the food here. It's just that the prime location to so many offices makes it convenient. It's easy to drop $20 on a basic lunch with drink and tip."}
{"text":"The place is dirty, parking is rough. I just dont understand all the reviews...they are very misleading. Who wants to pay $10 for a Gyro in a dive like this. Even the glasses are plastic. I would not take a date there. i would not take a co-worker there. I would not go there for a business lunch. If I had just come off the basketball court with 3 other sweaty friends i might go there. Yuck...dont waste your time."}
{"text":"I work downtown and when I go to lunch I usually choose this place. The servers are great and the food is really good as well. I love the chicken salad with the house made dressing! The dressing is so good and you get a side of delicious warm pita. It's a huge portion for lunch so you won't leave hungry. The pizza is also really good. I like this place a lot! Only downside is that it is quite expensive and gets really crowded around 11!"}
{"text":"My folks have been bringing me to Crazy Jim's since I was a kid and we still agree that it is the best Greek Food in town. The Gyro meat here is to die for. Get the Gyro Picado and you will love life! The menu is awesome across the board, especially the pizzas. If you are in the mood for some quality Mediterranean grub then this is your spot."}
{"text":"it's a tiny hole-in-the-wall type of place but it was very surprising! the place was packed when i stopped in for lunch. for the money it was worth every bite. a huge plate of gyros and giant cup of iced tea. 
i'll be making another stop here in the future."}
{"text":"I have always loved this restaurant and went last night to find it as wonderful as ever. I had the Ellen's pizza -- chewy, but crisp crust, delicious cheeses, topped with spinach and grilled chicken. Yum! My mom had the gyro/ feta  pita with fries. The food was good and so plentiful that she took almost half home. My sister was impressed by the penne pasta with mushrooms and chicken, with a creamy mushroom sauce. She couldn't get over the size of the side salad with its delicious creamy Greek dressing. Really, I have always been satisfied here."}
{"text":"Having lived in Phoenix for over thirty years and now living on the road I MISS CRAZY JIM'S !  The gyro feta salad is so good w that fantastic creamy dressing I just don't want to order anything else. And yes that soft flavorful pita bread unlike any other. My gal typically sticks to the Shrimp Piccata salad and is never disappointed. The staff is seasoned and friendly. This is the only location I have gone to and like it that way. 
It will get a bit noisy when it fills up but that's just the way it goes."}
{"text":"Good food, but horrible service. We will not be returning. Maybe worth doing takeout in lieu of dining in."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS! Tiny place, SO GOOD! I definitely underestimated this place by its looks (you know the saying) but, boy, am I glad I tried it! Mmmmmmmmmm"}
{"text":"I was here for lunch after some work meetings and the people we were with recommended the place. 

It was full by the time we arrived but we quickly got a table. The menu is all over the place, there is pasta, and huevos rancheros, and gyros! Like, what??? I'm not used to restaurants that have food from everywhere, I like my restaurants to specialize in one cuisine. But anyways. 

I got a bowl of pasta and it was oh my god like enough for my entire family. I could eat from the same plate for three days in a row and still have leftovers. The flavor was good, not too greasy, not too creamy. All the girls in the group got salads and those were also huuuuuuge (read it like donald trump). 

The place felt cold, like those places  you find at the mall. Not much character, it was very plain. Good place if  you are on a budget! It was cheap and you get tons of food. I wish I had a place like this when I was in college."}
{"text":"Pretty good Greek food.  The location is kind of hard to get to if you are coming in from the north or west.  Traffic might be so bad that you have to go down the block and double back. Parking is also a bit \"tight\".  During lunch there is a parking monitor to keep spaces open for customers, during peak hours its sometimes still a challenge to get good parking close to the building.  Inside, the atmosphere is definitely mom and pop/family run small restaurant in feel and style.  Seating is a bit limited, so be prepared to be patient sometimes to get seated, especially if you are more than a party of four.
The service is good, not necessarily fast, but they are attentive.  The food is excellent, pitas are light and fresh, salads are crisp.  I usually have the chicken picata pita, but the gyros are good too,  I have never ever in three years had a bad meal there.  Great for lunch if you aren't in a hurry, call ahead for seating or for take out."}
{"text":"Love this place! Made a ridiculous request once and they fulfilled it with no hesitation. Everything I've had here is really great. If you live around the area you must make this place a visit."}
{"text":"By far the best food in downtown Phoenix . The service always excellent. The manager always checking up on his customers. Making sure everything is going smoothly. All th employees have a smile on their face and make you feel welcome. They really care about how you're doing. Like you dine with them everyday. The food is top quality with so many unique Mediterranean flavors. But they also have traditional American food that everyone loves. The Creamy Greek dressing is their trade mark and won't be topped. Delicious with almost any lunch entree on the menu. I'd definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone. I'll definitely be back there."}
{"text":"The best Greek salad or feta salad with grilled chicken hands down. I love this place for salads and they do not skimp you on the grilled chicken like many places do. The grilled chicken is seasoned hot and fresh and so is the salad and ingredients. You get warm pita with each salad which tastes homemade(not sure if it is) and the service is good and fast. I order takeout here a few times a month. Add it to your list you won't be mad. Only drawback...they close early and closed Sundays..."}
{"text":"Very upset with the service here. We showed up at 7PM to have a nice dinner before an 8PM show across the street. I'm still sitting here at 7:48PM and I do not have my food. We asked our sever to check on our order, was told it would be 5 more minutes and after 12 more minutes we still didn't have our food. Ended up canceling out order and paying for only our drinks. Other people who arrived and ordered their food after us received their food almost immediately. Stay away from this place!"}
{"text":"I wasn't a huge fan of Crazy Jim's prior management, but I have to say that ever since they switched it up, I am starting to come back around. The food is average for downtown, but I love the interaction with the owner and welcome I get when I pickup my orders. The little things enhance the experience and I think Crazy is on the right track. 

Recommend the gyro, sauce is awesome."}
{"text":"My favorite place for Mediterranean food in the Valley. I am going to miss this place now that I am in Seattle. My boyfriend got me hooked on Crazy Jims. Our favorite dish is the halibut salad. We are both vegetarians but we do eat fish and they have the best Halibut in AZ. You know what I mean if you ever tried finding good fish in AZ. Fish is not easily found in the desert. They have the absolute best house salad dressing. I don't know how they make it but it taste creamy and lemony at the same time. Their pitas are warm and fluffy and their hummus is delicious. It was always a treat to have dinner there. Good bye Crazy Jims!"}
{"text":"A real cozy spot to grab some Greek. 

It's tiny, warm, and feels almost divey, but Crazy Jim's is not a bad place to grab a gyro. I'm not going to say it tastes the most 'authentic', but it is unquestionably satisfying.

It starts with the bread, because if you're not ordering a gyro on your first visit, you're doing it wrong. The pita is T H I C K. Flavorful. Heavy. It serves as a great foundation. The meat is tasty, the toppings are good and have plenty of customizable options. I had warm feta to top mine off, and it was great despite almost being too rich. They are very generous portions.

You can get pizza, beer, and a variety of other dishes at an affordable price, so you've got nothing to lose by giving it a try! 

Just be warned that parking is a bit of a pain."}
{"text":"The seating in here is a little 'cosy' and the sound bright, but the staff are most friendly and helpful, and the menu is very varied. The personal pizza's are great, as are several of the other dishes that I've sampled - Great place to get lunch!"}
{"text":"Crazy Jim's, I've never meet him but his foods crazy good.  I can eat the ptia bread all day, i think they make it in house.  

 I enjoy a great Gyro, *yearo Jyros\" at Jim's. The wraps fill you up and never disappoint me when I have it late because their to big for me to finish at the restaurant.  If you like treating your pallet  always try a new appetizer here, their located on the front of the menu so don't rush to open it as soon as you get one.  

This Mediterranean place can give Pita Jungle a run for its quality."}
{"text":"This Crazy Jim's sold their original 15th Ave/Indian School location several years ago (which is WAY better since the NEW owners fixed it up and kept with the original menu!)

I've been eating the same Feta Salad for years, so when I came to their new downtown location (expecting the same great food)...BOY, was I sadly disappointed!

Since when did a regular $9 salad shrink to be small enough to fit into a small hamburger size plastic clam shell take-out container??? This wasn't a side salad, ya know!

The employees were too busy chatting and ignoring customers...why bother?

Over-priced, skimpy portions, and poor service...don't be CRAZY, don't eat here!"}
{"text":"{heart}I am in love with their Chicken Feta Salad...best salad that I've ever had! I don't know what their other food tastes like...I keep ordering this salad every time I visit.

~~~Things to know if you haven't been here yet~~~

*Get there early (10:30-11am ) for Lunch or you'll be waiting for a table...

*Get there early and you'll get your food right away...

*Most of the tables are for party of 1 or 2...a few tables for 3-4 people. If you have a LARGE Party, you'll pretty much be taking up the entire dining room....

*VERY SMALL dining area and it gets VERY LOUD because of the cramped area (you're almost sitting in the lap of the person at the next table)...

*Tight parking behind the building (if you get there early, then you can park on the side. Front parking is for take-out orders)...

*BEST pita..EVER! Seriously, it truly is!

*Salads are plentiful and around $8-$10 dollar range, the tough part is deciding which one to order....Greek dressing is so GOOD!!!! 

*Salads typically come with iceberg/romaine lettuce mix...you can order a \"mixed greens\" version for a few bucks more...

*Good service...

*This location is BETTER than the downtown location {funny thing is that the original owners of this location SOLD IT to a new owner and I think it's way better now! The new owner redecorated too. The original owner runs the downtown location, which I was NOT impressed with at all...bad food, bad service}"}
{"text":"Stopped in with the husband - hell, we live a block away, so we have to try it sometime - got takeout. We were waited upon immediately and our stuff packed up to go quickly.
Great service!

Unwrapped our prize at home.. and.. well, we were underwhelmed.  I actually pawed around in the bottom of bag a bit to see if we missed anything. For $19, we had 2 gyros and sides.. a lot of money for not a lot of food. Gyros were very salty, small, dry..and .. well, I've had better :( Maybe I'm homesick for Chicago, and what a universe of Greek food there was out there.. lemon/garlic potatoes, tender gyro slices cuddled in hand-stretched pita.. there's no way this place could compete against, say, Cross Rhodes in Evanston, Illinois, or Larsa's in Skokie, IL.  It's just a different planet out here in dry, dusty Phoenix.  You get what you can if it's something \"exotic\", and try to like it.

I understand that small restaurants like this struggle to compete, and I appreciate that there's always a balance in the industry between what to offer and how much to charge for it.  The bottom line, profitability, is ultimately everything.

That was clear from our meal. 

Sorry...I wish I could have liked it."}
{"text":"This places was definitely just ok. I had the chicken feta pita. The pita was the best part of the meal. My husband got a pizza that was very soggy and salty. Don't waste your time with the pizza."}
{"text":"Great food and great service.  Reasonably priced for the downtown area.  Some of my favorites include the Salmon Caesar Salad and the Chicken Petra Pita.  As if that wasn't enough,  now they have dessert options!"}
{"text":"I've had my fair share of Greek food before, coming from houston where there is plenty of restaurants available. However, crazy Jim stands out as a fantastic experience - for my taste buds.  Nothing felt overly salty of gimmicky (corn syrup).  Everything tasted fresh. My calamari was cooked to perfection! So many places overcook calamari, thinking to avoid E. coli or whatever it is that poisons us, but that is mainly a threat from pork or land based meats, not seafood. The side pitas were great too. They melted in my mouth almost. I would come here again in the near future"}
{"text":"Great calzone, white w/basil , mozzarella and olive oil, led with the yeasty goodness of the crust. More Greek flavored than actual Greek dishs. Pizzas, salads, pastas, burgers and subs. Wasn't what I was expecting, but we will be back, was very good!"}
{"text":"CrazyJim's is SO GOOD. Warning: this place has ZERO ambiance, however, don't let their lack of trend fool you. Their Greek food is incredible--some of the best in the valley. My boyfriend and I love to take out from this place on a busy weeknight. The staff is always friendly and the food is always A+. I'd give this place 5 stars in a heartbeat if they had a nicer atmosphere.

Overall, take-out from Crazy Jim's if you're in the mood for delicious Greek food. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Ellen pizza and a spring mix chicken feta salad, you don't need anything else. We taken several friends here and night and all agreed it's good food. No only reason I don't get five stars is because sometimes the staff is so friendly, and they could use some tidying up."}
{"text":"Ever since the new folks took over this place has been wonderful.  The staff gets to know their customers well and my coworkers and I are greeted by name every time we go in. Their breakfast menu is great and you really can never go wrong with the hash browns.  I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm a foodie. I love all kinds. Normally I'm not a complainer but this place didn't stand a chance with the obviously low standards the have regarding quality and service. As soon as I walked in I could tell hostess chick was not happy to see me at 30 min till close. I ordered a gyro with greek salad and abaklava.  She told me they don't have greek salad but for additional cost, she can add feta to my regular salad. Say what? \"If you love greek food, you have to eat here\" or some other such nonsense that is written on the business card. Business cards that have the closing times crossed out and rewritten with sharpie. Super ghetto. Got home. No baklava. Called and she asked if I'd like to come get it or have a credit? Neither. I'd like the difference refunded to my card. The one good thing I can say is that they didn't argue and promptly refunded $4.12 to my card next morning. The meat inside the gyro (I bs you not) is like paper thin uniform pre cut deli slices a and my gyro was dripping grease. I ended up just taking a Caesar side salad btw. The gyro was super gross and I was honestly awakened at 2am by nausea and spent the next hour in the bathroom. I feel bad for anyone who goes there regularly. Maybe you don't know better but if you wanna see the difference for yourself, go have real, authentic, fresh, deliciousness at Athens Gyros right f down the street."}
{"text":"I have been going to Crazy Jim's for a couple of years now. I have never had a bad meal here. Everybody I have taken to Crazy Jims feels the same way. This is a greek restaurant, but they offer a variety of food. Their salads are great (their chicken caesar is my absolute favorite). They also offer pasta and pizza, both great! The chicken feta pita is my most recent discovery that is amazing, instead of onions I have ordered cucumbers in this pizza, om nom nom!! The lunch rush does get fairly busy, but they have a parking attendant to help out in the lot. They also make the best pita bread i have ever had!"}
{"text":"Had the feta gyro pita here with pasta salad. Holy crap the portions were huge. The gyro itself was tender and juicy, and the feta was copious (a little over the top), and the pita....so so good. The pita is really where this place shines. Oh yeah, its not pasta salad if you just give me a thing of penne pasta thats cold. But, good value its like ordering a gyro with a pasta dish. My co-workers really liked their chicken salad, and from the looks of it, they don't go lighthanded with chicken, so great value there.

It's a little weird that the same dish costs $2 less when you take-out versus dine-in....same portion size....

But still Crazy Jim's is decent to good food, good portions, and pretty good price. Good place for lunch."}
{"text":"I feel so blessed that I haven't had to write a bad review lately.  One reason is I ate at Crazy Jim's!  
Soooooooo good.  The hummus was creamy and you can tell freshly made.  The pita came out a little differently than I'm used to.  Instead of just warmed, it seems it was maybe fried in a little olive oil (I'm guessing) to make it a little crispier than other restaurants and tastier.  I'm a fan of this style.
I got the chicken patra pita and there was so much chicken, cheese, and peppers that I had to eat it with a fork and knife.  There was no way I could pick that baby up and eat it without everything falling out.  The chicken was tender and juicy.  The tzatziki sauce was delicious.  My side salad was full of green, leafy lettuce.  Quality food.  
Our server was so overly friendly too.  I can't wait to go back!  
YUMMY!"}
{"text":"I have to vent! Crazy Jim's is so great when you eat in, but they can't do a pickup order to save their life! I had my bf pick up our dinner, and they forgot my side of pita bread, didn't give me my side of balsamic vinegar, and charged me $.75 extra for an extra hard boiled egg (totally used to this fee), but they only gave me half of one! So I had to drive all the way back over there and they didn't even say sorry, or offer another half of an egg!"}
{"text":"Grew up around the corner, haven't been here in years. The calamari salad is still awesome, pita bread is warm and soft!  Still small dining space, but so worth it!"}
{"text":"Soooo good! Baked feta is to die for! Best tasting gyros around! Great service and friendly staff!!"}
{"text":"First time going here and it was very good! Probably some of the best pita I've had and service was excellent with many options to pick from. Only complaint that makes this place not 5 stars would be not enough meat in the meals but that's just me"}
{"text":"Wow! This place looks great inside, but the food is just do good! I had lunch here and ordered a Gyro Picado Pita which had strips of gyro, grilled green peppers, onions, and jalapenos with a side of Greek soup. The soup itself is wonderful and I could just have their soup alone. The gyro is yummy!!! You've got to come a little early to beat the lunch crowd."}
{"text":"Really good! We eat there frequently and it is consistently good. I'd give it a 5 but I tend to rate too high I think."}
{"text":"Delicious no lettuce salads - except they need to chop their cucumbers smaller. Very yummy food overall. Hate the seating atmosphere. Everyone is on top of each other and not in a good way. But, you can get it to go so thats a bonus."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with my Dad and my brother today and I thought it was a really solid meal. I got the chicken picado sub with a side salad. It was really good. The sandwich was simple, just chopped up chicken, bell pepper, onion, and jalapenos, but it was very tasty. The salad has a really good dressing and the portion sizes are generous. I would definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"I went to Crazy Jim's years ago, and though I liked it and it was down the street from my house, I never made it back.... that is, until yesterday. The husband and I got lunch at Crazy Jim's and it was awesome! This place has house made sauces and dressings and house baked breads... that's fabulous! I had the chicken picado pita... a fresh, hot, thick, perfect pita piled with delish grilled chicken, peppers, onions, and jalapenos... top it with the tzatziki... you don't get much better than that. Oh, and it came with a side... I chose the lemon orzo chicken soup... a huge helping of chicken soup that was fresh and fantastic. This was under 10$. Wow. The husband got the steak sandwich and fries... also fab. We definitely need to come back here, in fact, I think it's the husband's new fave place.... what are you waiting for? Try this little place... it rocks.


PS the only problem with CJ's is they don't have skordalia...... get the skordalia going and I won't even think of another Greek place."}
{"text":"I'm here and it's as dangerous as I feared. The pita bread and pizza dough is cooked here on site. It's so warm and delicious. It's too dangerous. I ate it all. The crazy gyro salad was ridiculously good. I could eat this stuff all day."}
{"text":"I've been eating at Crazy Jim's for over 20 years.  It's a tiny hidden gem in the middle of Phoenix.  Everything from the pitas to the gyros is homemade, and it's consistently fabulous.  They even use real deal imported Feta cheese - not the awful stuff they sell at the grocery stores.  Our favorite is the flaming Feta appetizer and gyro Feta pita entree.  Also, if you love blue cheese salad dressing, I highly recommend it.  Crazy Jim's homemade blue cheese dressing is the best I've ever tasted."}
{"text":"They open earlier in the mornings on sat and sun but don't serve breakfast.....little strange.  Then charge 1.99 for an 8 ounce coffee. I can get more coffee at that price at the local Starbucks"}
{"text":"Great Chicken Feta Pita among other dishes. Food is good, parking is bad. Plan on waiting if you go during a peak time since seating is minimal."}
{"text":"The only thing crazy about Crazy Jim's is people who have eaten there more than once. It's not so much that it's bad, it's very average. It's more that the prices do not even remotely match what you get."}
{"text":"Sketchy name indeed, but their grilled chicken pita sandwich is the bomb! It was filled to the brim with saucy, tasty goodness. I still think about that damn sandwich. I need to go back soon!

Interior was a bit lacking, service was OK, but the food is sooo worth it. Looking forward to trying other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Always packed at lunch time this place is a ghost town evenings and weekends.  The staff is friendly and efficient.   

The pasta salad is tasty but the rest of the pastas are just ok.  Pitas and no lettuce salads are phenomenal.   Meats are always perfectly seasoned.  Chicken rice soup is delicious!"}
{"text":"I love this place!!!!!! Yum! I really enjoy the salads and the pita bread is amazing.. Don't forget about the dressing.... omg"}
{"text":"Went with Co-worker to lunch at 1 pm. Ordered the feta gyro with a side salad. I started eating my salad and before I ate my gyro I found a hair. The waitress was busy cleaning a table and talking to another waitress that she didn't realize we were trying to get her attention. I finally took my plate up to another waitress to ask for another gyro. When the waitress finally came to check on us she apologized and would check on status of my food. I got my food and ate. Usually if a problem a manager comes out to apologize and provide discount or free dessert. Never saw the manager and only the 2 waitresses apologized. Would not eat there again"}
{"text":"I like crazy Jim's. They have good consistent food at a great price. I love the mushroom steak cheese sandwich with crispy fries and a drink. Friendly attentive staff."}
{"text":"By far the BEST Greek food in the city.  Crazy Jim's is a little gem...great and homey restaurant.

We come here often, and everything we ever had has been fresh and delicious, and the service is always very nice.  A definite repeat!

My personal faves are the chicken picado pita and the spring mix chicken feta salad.  You can't go wrong with either one. I always order a side of their grilled jalapenos...YUM!"}
{"text":"I was just hanging out in Central Phoenix the other day and decided to use my handy dandy Yelp App to find a fun new place to eat. We were wanting to try something new and stumbled across Crazy Jim's.

It's such a small restaurant with the tables pretty close together, so it certainly isn't anything special to look at but the food is really great! After reading some of the reviews we tried the Chicken Feta Salad and the Chicken Feta pita. The Salad was a really good size with all the fixin's and they certainly don't skimp on the Feta! The chicken feta pita was messy to eat but delicious! I don't think I've had enough greek food to have a super dependable opinion of how it's prepared but I really enjoyed it!

The service gets a mixed review: one of our waitresses was very friendly, personal, and really fun to be around. Our other waitress was very even toned and not very engaging so between the two of them the service was good enough."}
{"text":"They get top stars just for making sure we knew they weren't putting the rush on us!
So we get there kinda late on Sunday evening,no worries...
We're treated very well,staff warm and genuine.
We both opt for different types of personal pizza.
I got the cheeze...Simple,simple,but good and tasty.
I never knew this place existed and look foward to going back and tryong something else!"}
{"text":"Service was awesome very welcoming waitress food was good just a small little place but very clean definitely will return for different dishes"}
{"text":"A local favorite! The food, service and cleanliness are all Top Notch! Consistent \"A\" rating by the health Dept.

Probably the best thing about Crazy Jim's is the fluffiness of the Pitas! It seems like everywhere else you go they're cold, thin and hard. Jim's are warm and soft, like a fresh Tortilla!

Can't say enough good things about this place. Been coming for years and will continue"}
{"text":"The food is good here. The pita bread and Feta cheese are the best in town. Parking and entering the lot is a bit tricky at times, especially around rush hour. The funny thing is they have some of the best french fries in town. Who knew? All the food is tasty though. They have Gyros, Pizza, a great Chicken Picada Salad-yum. (And BTW, their house dressing is to die for!)  The place itself is kind of divey and small but the food is not. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place has a variety of items to try. Amazing pita wrap and salads. My friend tried the pizza and she was in love with her pizza. Can't wait to come back to try more food from crazy Jim's!"}
