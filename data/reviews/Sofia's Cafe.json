{"text":"Excellent Excellent moved here from Seattle they are fast good food we have tried almost all the menu and order out all the time highly recommend this place! Love it!"}
{"text":"My office ordered lunch from here. We were one semi-large order, and so we didn't exactly expect the food to arrive in twenty minutes. However, we didn't expect to wait two hours for it either. We ordered for delivery, and our order consisted of two subs, a burger, the tortellini, and a calzone. Nearly two hours later, our food finally arrives. The delivery driver left our food and drove away without another word. Upon tasting our meals, we have come to the conclusion that the food was sub-par. Mostly bland and in dire need of seasoning, our food was chewy and soggy. We had high hopes after looking at such a beautiful menu, but were greatly disappointed. My office will not be ordering here again."}
{"text":"This place is delish!  Plus, they deliver and it is fast!  The gyros are super.  On someone else's review, there was a complaint of too much salt on the fries, which is true.  Next time I plan on getting the salt on the side, but will definitely eat here often!"}
{"text":"Firstly let me begin with the fact that I had great expectations after viewing some pictures of pizza from sofia's cafe. The pictures looked really delicious but then again looks can be deceptive. So 35 dollars and 30 minutes later, my pizza gets delivered. Well safe to say, the pizza was nothing like I had expected. I ordered a simple pepperoni pizza, you can't really mess that up right? Wrong!!! The pizza was extremely greasy, literally there was grease dripping from every slice and the crust was saturated with it. If your looking for pizza, go elsewhere......"}
{"text":"I ordered through the UberEats app and just wanted to say the food was absolutely amazing, I got a falafel sandwich with fries and would recommend it to anyone!!!!"}
{"text":"So good ! Awesome service & great food! Our favorite \"not cooking\" dinner place! Try the Hummas with chicken shawarma !"}
{"text":"Placed an order and get a call when almost drive in said order was canceled because they can't make it.  1st time ever happened on my pick up, horrible waste of my time"}
{"text":"We often order delivery here, because there aren't a ton of places that deliver to our business. The food usually is decent, but the service seems to be lacking. A couple of times we have called to place an order and have been told they are \"too busy\" but then still take the order after getting upset with us.   The first time I ordered the 1/2 chicken plate, it was good. Today I had it, and the chicken was horribly overcooked, the rice was undercooked and hard as can be and the pita was dry and hard, tasting days old.  Don't order the Stromboli. It's all bread. And the chicken wings aren't good either. I suppose if you stick to Gyros you're probably safe."}
{"text":"We just enjoyed lunch at Sophia's. This place is amazing. Even though we've got a few pizza and kebob places nearer to home (about 250 miles away) we happened to have a restaurant.com certificate and thought we would give it a try. Showed up and no one was here. It's a not a very large restaurant, but they have an extensive menu!  From Italian to Middle Eastern. We ordered the XLarge Steak Pizza ($16.99) which is about the middle of the road size they have and it was awesome. The crust was soft, but crispy on the bottom. Unlike other pizza's we've had this one had no oily/greasy feel or taste.  Also ordered the Beef Chicken combo ($13.95)  It was out of this world.  Such Great Flavor!  If you're in the area, it's definately worth a try!  For the person that gave this place one star... There has to be a reason your ordered from them \"8 Times\"!!  They are good.  Don't use a 3rd party \"Eat24Hours\" if they keep fudging up the order.  Call Sofia's directly!  I doubt highly they will mess up and if they do, I'm sure they'll fix it prompty.  If you eat there they also have a couple of very nice big screens mounted on the walls."}
{"text":"Quite disappointed. Ordered a bacon cheeseburger with fries and a veggie plate.  The burger was nothing special and the fries were really salty.  The Veggie Plate:  The hummus was so oily! It also had a stange taste to it. The spanikopita was soggy. The falafel was inedible. The dolmades (stuffed grape leaves) were \"ok\". I also ordered feta cheese, it was way over salted. Basically, out of the whole plate, I managed to eat only the stuffed grape leaves. The rest of the plate was pretty inedible.  We will not be ordering from this place again."}
{"text":"Wish I read the reviews before I ordered. Super expensive, almost 2 hours for delivery. No dressing on my salad or on the side, etc... I could go on, but what is the point.. Do not recommend."}
{"text":"One of Las Vegas' best kept secret. The food is delicious, the portions are so big and wide selection.  This place has a lot to offer!"}
{"text":"Very good food every time. The pizza is good as well as the gyros and sandwiches. One of my favorite lunch places. Real food not fast food. We like the salads, shawarma sandwich or pizza, gyros, and kabobs best but the soups are good too!"}
{"text":"Got a steak hoagie from Sofia's as takeout and was really disappointed when i got home and opened the bag.   This is what they advertise their sandwich as: Subs and grinders are served on a fresh Italian roll. Subs are topped with fresh lettuce, tomatoes, onions and mayo. Grinders are baked until golden brown. Deluxe includes French fries. Combo includes French fries and a small fountain drink or can of soda.  First off, I had to basically build my sandwich. The bread wasn't sliced open fully, more like sliced to make a pocket in which a minimal amount of thin sliced steak (which was tasty) was crammed, and about a half a head of shredded lettuce was jammed into (which mostly fell out) it. The tomatoes were cut like someone had done it with a butter knife and were on top of my fries, (this is not due to carrying the bag, I was careful) There was no onions anywhere, nor mayo, or any condiments at all.  I got the combo, and my fries were really, really really really salty... once I had a bite of one I immediately had to have a sip of root-beer that was included in my meal. I can't be for certain because I took one sip and immediately spit it out as my soda tasted like someone hooked a liquid soap dispenser to the soda fountain.   Between part of my sandwich having been missing, overly salty fries, putrid fountain soda, no napkins and slow sloppy service ( I didn't include that part of my experience, but when you see a customer walk into your spot, you should think about greeting them and asking if they've been served) I'm really not sure how this place stays in business. My experience was pretty bad just based on food quality and I will not be back for any reason, will not be suggesting this spot to anyone that is actually looking to have a decent meal."}
{"text":"Took well over half an hour just to complete our simple order of two souvlaki sandwiches. Both tasted like cardboard. The pita bread was hard and stale. We thought we would check the place out since we had a groupon. Huge mistake. Food wouldn't have been worth it even if it was free considering how long it took, especially when we were the only customers there!"}
{"text":"Well to start the delivery driver showed up SMOKING A CIGARETTE AND DRENCHED IN SWEAT while holding the food. That is absolutely not ok, its not just the kitchen staff that should be trained in sanitation. I ordered a salad with a scoop of tuna, the salad was average but the tuna was dark brown with mayo slapped on top, not mixed at all and had a horribly sour smell. Safe to say I didn't eat it. It was a waste of money and i will be calling the health department when they open on monday. What a disgrace."}
{"text":"I ordered using the eat 24 app. The delivery was over 45 minutes late with no attempt to contact me. The item that I was looking forward to the most they did not include and instead swapped it out with something that I absolutely detest, again without even contacting me. They charged me full price anyway. I also ordered the fettuccine Alfredo. It is absolutely disgusting. It's bland, the pasta is over-cooked and is just a giant mushy mess, and the \"sauce,\" which is more like a paste, has a bunch of green specs of some kind in it. Truly gross. I would definitely stay away from this place. No attempt to make it right, no apparent concern for how terrible the quality and service has been."}
{"text":"It's not much from the outside, a space sandwiched between a Laundromat (last wash at 10PM sharp!) and a salon, but inside is a kitchen churning out dishes from two separate menus: Mediterranean and Italian, go figure!  So far I've stuck to the Med menu, with several sandwiches and gyros you can't go wrong. I prefer to get anything with the garlic sauce, ask for extra on the side. It's flavorful but the bread is a little thicker than expected, and if the chicken is a little on the dry side, the sauce helps. I don't normally like pickles on my sandwiches, but here they add that perfect element that takes it to the next level.  Service is quick, menu is extensive, they have a large dining room and delivery service. But that garlic sauce is what you need to get here. I would buy it bottled."}
{"text":"I love this place! They always deliver on time and never get my order wrong! I love their blunt customer service as well, I hate places that front on their customer service.  Very honest place"}
{"text":"This is in my top 5 for delivery, especially because it's a non pizza option. Reasonable delivery times and good food and fair prices.   My go to item is the beef shawarma, which is served with tahini sauce, onions, and tomatoes. I like to get the tzatziki on the side and spoon it onto my Shawarma or dip fries.   The cheeseburgers are also super delicious. Big seasoned patties with lots of veggies. The hubby likes his special order without certain items, so I put in the special instruction on Eat24 and they have never messed up an order. Definitely a winner for this reason.   We've also ordered the cheesesteak sandwich, chicken fingers, and calzones, which were also decent in terms of taste. Most items are served a la carte or combo with fries or fries&drink (fountain or can). The cheesecake is tasty for desert.    As for service/delivery I always use eat24 for my orders. Only once have I phoned the restaurant directly. I order fries but they heard rice, so a communications error. No big deal. Kind of funny actually when I realized what happened. I never called to complain and I've ordered from them several times since (via Eat24).  Definitely not a deal breaker. Particularly since they've never messed up an order through Eat24. Delivery is usually pretty quick and always within specified timeframe. It's usually the same driver and he recognizes us every time.   I should add that there's a nearby spot on w Sahara called \"Sophia's\" (I think it's a chain in town) which I have mistakenly ordered from thinking it was this \"Sofia's.\"  They are not the same and the food quality/service aren't on par with one another either. Choose Sofia's."}
{"text":"Delicious food, I had a gyro and fries every thing was made fresh even the sauce on the gyro was fresh tasting dill cream. The owner was chatting with me while he prepared everything. A very welcoming attitude I will be back!"}
{"text":"The only thing I've tried is their gyros, but I've had at least 30 of them. They're delicious and inexpensive. The place is never packed. Most of the time I ask for no sauce and they've never complained."}
{"text":"We have ordered delivery from Sofia's 8 times now through Eat24Hours. This last order was now the 6th time the restaurant has failed to read directions on our order. Sometimes certain items in my order are just simply not delivered at all. Sofia's doesn't seem to be able to put their heads on straight, so we're taking our business elsewhere. So sick of your screw-ups! Cya!"}
{"text":"I went here on 8/7/13 on a whim, my father was in town and we were in the area, when we decided to try it out.  I ordered the Avocado salad, and it was superb! My father got a lasagna and he loved it as much as I loved mine, the flavors burst in your mouth! They are good at what they do!"}
{"text":"Staying at a hotel, I ordered from here. The food was excellent and quick delivery service."}
{"text":"Horrible! Just look at my photos of the food. Messy packaging. Missing items in the delivery. No sauce on the noodles under the eggplant. Food was so plain and basic. Avoid!"}
{"text":"Awesome gyros, but customer service is horrendous. The male owner is absolutely miserable, and if it wasn't for his wife, this place would be closed in 5 minutes."}
{"text":"The guy here is super friendly we love coming here all the time! The pizza is always great and the guy here always helps us out picking our deals and engages in conversation with us all the time. Favorite spot to eat always!"}
{"text":"Everything we ordered was fresh and homemade. You can tell that the shop is family owned and ran. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I really like the food here. Nothing fancy but the food is delicious and they serve big portions. I recommend their gyro plate to try."}
{"text":"I still love this place!!! I wish they had the option of ordering gallons of their tzaziki sauce...I love that stuff!!!  The dolmades are VERY good - albeit a bit bland(which is why I suggest ordering lots of tzaziki!) And sometimes come in different sizes.  The gyro is very good as well. The meat is seasoned well, the pita fluffy, the veggies crispy and fresh!  Hummus is also good, but nothing to write home about.  Babaganoush was oddly bitter for my taste.   The delivery man is really cool and very friendly :-) The second time around, I waited a little over an hour...but it was a Friday and it was raining, so it was understandable."}
{"text":"I would give this place a 1 star if I could. I ordered a $9.99 lunch special and a small side of french fries and ranch, my total was $19.00. When I asked why the bill was so much, the driver stated the prices, but everything was different than on the menu. I then called the restaurant to double check prices on there and the person who answered doesn't speak any English. She kept saying we are closed and then hung up on me. I was hung on 3 times before a gentleman answered and quoted me different prices than what I was charged. NEVER go here and the food wasn't that great either."}
{"text":"Always fresh and filling. We order from work and the fries are crisp when delivered. Thanks to the staff for always being so helpful and making your customers happy."}
{"text":"If i could ill put 0 stars worst customer service!!! First time some one course my guy because his employees cant use the cc mechine, and sweating all over the pizza!! Dont use gloves!! Shame that places like that excite"}
{"text":"I have never been to a worse establishment than this! I will never ever come back here. They're the rudest people I've ever purchased food from! It was like we were  inconveniencing her just walking in. She literally just dropped our food in front of us and walked away. STAY AWAY FROM HERE"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a random afternoon for lunch.  The shop is in the same plaza as my office, so it seemed convenient.  Appearance... right off the bat, the 'storefront' has little to offer.  Little to no decor, aged tables & chairs and a horrific odor that nearly made me leave upon entry.  Service... there were two people there a young man, and a middle-aged woman. I wasn't greeted by either.  I placed my order, (the young man took the order), offered to upgrade to a value meal and cashed me out without incident.  Quality...  Beverage selection was extremely limited.  They had two coolers, but only about a quarter full with limited sodas and bottled water.  I ordered a simply cold sandwich, with fries, both great tasting and hearty servings.  One small concern is the person preparing my food (the same young man who checked me out) accepted two cell phone calls while making my sandwich, one has to wonder how 'sanitary' his phone is!!!  Overall a pretty average experience and slightly above average quality and portions.  Pricing and parking are excellent, location can be a bit hard to find, so just pull in the plaza at the corner of W. Sahara and Monte Christo.    Stop in for lunch and enjoy, just dont plan on bringing the family for a family outing!"}
{"text":"I just ordered from them, the soups are delicious! The service is great! The delivery guy super nice! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Not the Sonia's of yesteryear. The chicken came out quickly and was dry and it appeared I caught then end of the lunch period. Service was slow even though the place was empty. I used to go there often but don't think I'll be going back."}
{"text":"Food is excellent!! Small little quiet place to stop buy for lunch or dinner .  Grilled chicken salad is delicious ."}
{"text":"If it gave me an option to not give any stars, they would receive NO stars!! We ordered the fettuccine Alfredo and it was super watery! Super watery as if they just poured milk over the pasta! This for $9.99?!?! Should have just gone mcdonalds and have a feast for that amount! My co-worker called them to express how watery it was and they were flat out RUDE! They said that it should be like that! Psshhhh even my 10 year old could cook better pasta then that! Sorry but not satisfied!!!! Never again are we ordered at this place!"}
{"text":"Order online through eat24 app. And confused it with a different Sofia closer to the airport. They had delivery on the website and when I called to change my order to delivery. They said they did not delivery to the airport. Even though the website said it would take my order with a delivery charge. Never had there food and will never go. Do to bad customer services and misrepresentation online. Enjoy my $10!!!!!"}
{"text":"Sophia's Cafe is a great place.  Very friendly and quick service. In my opinion the inside is a little dark and could use a little bit more light. The food on the other hand is a out of this world and you must try this locations food at least 1 time."}
{"text":"Was not too impressed. Took 1 hour and 45 mins to deliver and when we finally got it, it was not good at all. Cold & soggy! $30 for two item pizza that was very disappointing and lacked effort."}
{"text":"I love this place! I grew up with one in range on the east side so when I saw it on the Eat24 app for my new place, I knew I had to order.  Food is always fresh and tasty and they serve steak fries, which are my favorite! Meatball sub is actually cut into a loaf in a way that the meatballs are actually held in instead of falling out the sides.   Be careful if you order delivery! It only took them 15 minutes to get here when I ordered last so make sure you're ready to answer the door when you hit submit. The food was still so hot I had to wait a couple minutes to eat it.  The real sell point here is the staff. I have never had a negative experience with anyone working at a Sofia's.  The prices are fair and the food is great! If you're craving Italian, Mediterranean, or American, Sofia's is the best pick here in Chinatown."}
{"text":"this place was the absolute worse service I have ever experienced. not only was I unable to even order my food but the employee hung up on me when I politely asked for a mangers number to address some questions I had regarding a certificate I purchased for this place. it is honestly sad that they have people working for them with such bad attitudes. very unprofessional."}
{"text":"DO NOT ORDER THE CHILI. I ordered a sandwich and a bowl of chili. The sandwich was very good, but the chili tasted like marinara sauce and salsa mixed together."}
{"text":"I am really disappointed when I got my Thursday special (which was 8 piece chicken wings w/ french fries and a soda) there was no sauce on the wings when I order mild, and the wings did not look delicious at all. I'm kind of scared to eat them. They do have good pizza but I was so disappointed when I got my wings."}
{"text":"I placed an order for takeout from this place on Beyond Menu. It was placed at 8:43, for a 9:30 delivery. My money was taken from my account. The 9:30 delivery time came and went. Turns out the restaurant closes at 9:30. I called the Beyond Menu customer service number, and the customer service representative tells me the order was confirmed with the restaurant. I try to call the restaurant again, and so does the customer service representative. Guess what? My husband and I have no food, and you can't get a hold of anyone at the restaurant because they are closed. Don't confirm orders you have no intention of fulfilling. Thank goodness Beyond Menu was nice enough to refund my money!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at Sophia's before and always enjoyed their food, but had not tried their Gyros. After attempting to place a delivery order at another Mediterranean restaurant and being treated extremely rudely by their telephone order person, I remembered that Sophia's would deliver Gyros. I am so glad that my craving for Gyros led me to try one from Sophia's! The food was fantastic, the delivery was speedy, and the delivery man was so nice. I will definitely be recommending Sophia's to others in my complex and will be ordering from them again soon!"}
{"text":"The lady there is really nice. But the old man is kinda rude i think he doesnt want us to order. Not smiling either. Theres no energy. But the food is okay too nothing unique. And the price is changing everytime i order. LOL!"}
{"text":"The gyro plate and feta and everything is so good that I can't help but fantasize that I am some secret agent ready to take a bullet for Sofia's Cafe.  I keep a steely hawk eyed stare at all times to protect her and I utilize brutal forms of open handed combat inspired by the wild boar in order to better defend her honor.  The grape leaves are really good and the yogurt sauce should just be called yogi sauce since it activates my deeper inner realms of enlightenment with the sheer yum yum of it.  The baba ganoush woops some bunghole too!"}
{"text":"We always order their burgers. LOVE their French fries with no salt!! It's always perfectly cooked!! But tried there fish n chips, the fish was kind of chewy? Tried the wings as well it was okay. Smelt like vinegar. But wish they had more variety of sauces. It's close to home too"}
{"text":"I didnt like this place at all food wasn't good wasn't freash I know a lot about Mediterranean food and this is not the way how it shpuld taste.."}
