{"text":"Casual atmosphere and amazing Italian food! Highly recommend it! The pizza is great, the pasta is all handmade, all they need is some beer and wine ! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Authentic Italian food made fresh with quality ingredients.  Good service and excellent menu choices"}
{"text":"Wonderful, all homemade Italian food. Yum Yum Yum!! My husband had the chicken parm., and I had the ravioli, both were fantastic!! The garlic bread was the best I have ever had! The owners were so incredibly nice, and even sent us home with some cake for breakfast in the morning!!! So good! Do yourself a favor, and go go go! (oh and the portions are so large it's dinner and lunch the next day!)"}
{"text":"The food is excellent, especially their marinara sauce, the portions generous, and the staff is incredibly friendly."}
{"text":"Excellent value- high end quality Italian food in casual atmosphere.
Great price at lunch. Fabulous eggplant parm, great marinara, good alfredo. Kids liked the foccaccio pizza. Italian rock music was pleasant. No wine but for the price food can't be beat."}
{"text":"BYOB. Penne carbonara, great, just needed a little sauce. Pizza good but ordered slice which was HUGE! Great value. Dissapointed they used canned mushrooms. Service needs real help. Would definitely come back for pasta. Bread is awesome! Will give full pizza a try. Slice could have been hotter, pepperoni not really sweat..."}
{"text":"Finally got to try La Fornarina tonight for take out.  The gnocchi was fantastic and I also got a chef salad.  So excited to crack open the container and find it topped with fresh mozzarella, so good!

I'll definitely be back with the family."}
{"text":"Stopped in dragging after a tough and long day at work wanting a good meal and got one.  I ordered the baked calzone with fresh tomatoes and olive oil. Got a basket of fresh homemade bread to start that was awesome.  The calzone came and looked great. Everything was made from scratch and tasted like it.  The dough tasted great and was full of cheese and ham.  It melted in your mouth and hit the spot!  Just what I needed!  I will be bringing the entire family back for an encore performance.  Authentic Italian!!!"}
{"text":"We used to line up at Pizza Napolitana in the freezing cold, and give up after 20 minutes, only to saunter into this place, on the corner of Dante and St. Laurent. 

I think a lot of people have discovered this little gem the same way, and this place is building up tidy little reputation for excellent service, great Italian soul food, and space when Napolitana is full.

Put it this way - when we're looking for somewhere to eat hearty Italian when it's minus 20, Fornarina is starting to land in the first-choice spot, repeatedly. It's that good! Others have clearly caught on, because it's getting fuller each time we go."}
{"text":"This place may not be hip, but it's the perfect place to go with a family--especially with small children. My family came here on the evening of my nephew's 4th birthday, and we are all particular about food and definitely know good Italian food. La Fornarina was just what we wanted. There's plenty of room (no wait on a Thursday evening), the wait staff is super friendly and accommodating, and the food was actually pretty good. We started with calamari, which were tasty, and mussels in a marinara sauce that was amazing. My brother ordered a pasta dish with sausage, I think, in a \"rose\" sauce. The sauce was tasty and the pasta was perfectly al dente--the whole table remarked on it. The pizza was nice and salty, with a good neapolitan style crust. At the end, the waitress even brought my nephew a piece of chocolate cake with a sparkler in it that just about blew his mind."}
{"text":"Food is wonderful, only think I don't care for is the location.  I honestly think this place would kill it in a larger building.  Would also be nice if they served at least beer and wine."}
{"text":"Food and price was good. But the service was lacking, the waiter never came to the table. He gave us a picture of water to serve ourselves! The first picture of water had  something floating in it by the way!! He opened up a bottle of wine and did not  serve us our first class!!! He gave us bread  without butter! He never check on us  to see if everything was fine. It was like he did not care ...."}
{"text":"Went there on a busy Saturday night and the service was great. We were 5, and ordered different appetizers and received them in no time. They have a very impressive wood stove and absolutely loved the pizza. We will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"Great authentic Italian food! All the pasta is hand made and delicious. the chef/owner Santi is very hospitable and will even comes out to your table  and offers to make your ordered dish a special way! We would definitely recommend the Manicotti, garlic cheese bread and the penne Fornarina!"}
{"text":"They definitely get full points on service - its unpretentious, friendly and the portions are generous. 

The food isn't very memorable however - as far as pasta and pizza go it certainly isn't terrible and it even merits a passably \"authentic\" Italian stamp - but it definitely isn't the best that  Montreal or its little Italy have to offer!"}
{"text":"My family went here for the first time last week. We were very impressed with how good the food was, so much better than the big chain places like Olive Garden and carrabas, for about the same cost. Nice, friendly atmosphere that is suitable for children. We will definitely be going back again very soon!"}
{"text":"My friend and I got the calzone, the gnocchi, and a couple slices of pizza to try.  The calzone was not bad, but nothing stood out except the dough was a little sweet, which we did not care for since every other calzone I have ever had was savory.  The pizza came on focaccia, which was not terrible but I am not a fan of sicilian style.  

The biggest letdown was the Gnocchi.  They claim their pastas are made fresh, but after growing up in New York and living in Italy for four years I can say shame on them.  Making gnocchi can be a pain and time consuming, so I was excited for some home made, it has been awhile.  Imagine my surprise when I taste the same stuff I buy in the store.  It was probably the Gia Russa brand you can purchase at the wal mart behind it, maybe de cecco, but it was not fresh.  Also the sauce was too thick and had too much flour in it, giving it a gluey texture.

The article in the Fort Mill times was the whole reason we went, I remember the owner saying in it that \"he speaks flour\".  A little too much flour if you ask me.   There are plenty of other places to spend your money, take a pass."}
{"text":"Superb service, delicious food and gracious owners! This place is  becoming a regular once a week joint for my family! I have not come across a single dish that we didn't like... Their meatball spaghetti is truly the best I have tried so far... All their cakes and tiramisu and home made. A must try italian place in Tega Cay"}
{"text":"We had a really nice visit to La Fornarina. Manicotti and Carbonara were very good, as was the complimentary focaccia.  The star though, was probably my son's simple spaghetti with marinara. Yum!  The marinara was perfect!

We love supporting a local business, so we will be back.  

The only thing I fear will hurt them is the physical environment. The place is completely unchanged from the previous tenant. The set up is strange and you feel a tad awkward when you walk in - just unsure of whether you should order at the counter or sit. There are signs about a buffet, but I didn't see one.  Someone was quick to navigate us to a table, but it just feels...well, awkward, as I said before. 

In short, you are coming here for the food - not the atmosphere.  But come here. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out, staff was very friendly. True Sicilian accents a plus! 

Chicken parm and cheesy garlic focaccia... Chicken was juicy and tender, homemade marinara, bread was fresh and a nice change from the standard French loaf. 

Kids loved the pizza on focaccia and mozzarella sticks.

Dessert... Cannoli was average but Tiramisu was the best I've ever had ( and I've had a lot!).

This is a new family favorite!!!"}
{"text":"Everything was delicious, impressive and authentic. Great friendly staff. Take your own bottle of wine. Can't wait to visit again. 
From Garlic cheese bread and spaghetti, to great baked pastas and salads, we are always happy we chose this friendly place."}
{"text":"...so its World Cup time, Italy & the U.S.A being the teams i support, i decided to go to little italy to take in the game and get some grub...so i thought to myself, \"lets make it happen\"...i stumbled upon this place since it was on the corner of st. laurent, however it was full for the game...but the owner who was 2 feet away, while he was holding a cigar, asked me if i had ever been there before...said no, and invited me to watch the game downstairs with him and his friends...so we sat down upon the start of the game...the calamari, the mussels, the salsiccia cacciatore for starters where great, the pizza from the wood burning brick oven had me reminiscent of so many bites into slices of pizza that just made my mouth water...and i had some of the best bolognese sauce i have had in this great city...especially considering the price...and the atmosphere was intense and \"tony the tiger's catch phrase\", but keep in mind it was for a World Cup game...now i do recommend eating at this establishment, but not watching a World Cup match here with a bunch of italian's if you have virgin ears...ohhhh, the things i heard would make andrew dice clay blush, and over a soccer game nonetheless...so it is not for the faint of heart...but the best part was after...we all, and i mean everyone from every restaurant took to the streets, and celebrated the win with a lethal fever and passion, shut down the streets, flags, singing, and plenty of celebration...so try it out just for the experience, or wait until the Cup is over, and give it a try...i can only imagine its a lot better under normal circumstances...!!!!..."}
{"text":"We love this place. Focaccia pizza is very authentic Italian. Best spinach ravioli I've had. This is great authentic Italian. The owners are very friendly. I highly recommend this menu."}
{"text":"If I could give ten stars I would. Just finished an enjoyable dinner with my family of authentic Italian food. The owners are extremely friendly and accommodating. The food is incredible, you could taste the freshness in every bite.  please support these folks. I can't wait to try the pizza."}
{"text":"Grandson, and friend, of Sicilian immigrants...

La Fornarina is as good as it gets.  Thus far, I've tried the pizza (sauce is very much homemade (!)); riceballs (saffron isn't a cheap ingredient, but the owner uses it to ensure it's  authentic).

The Eggplant Parmigiana is equal to my Grandmother's.  My Grandmother's eggplant was known for not only being delicious, but devoid of any bitterness (amaro).  I can say the same of La Fornarina.

The Penne Carbonara is very different than the neopolitan version I'm accustomed to, which is good, as it's rich in flavor, without being too heavy.

The owners are fantastic people.  Great, upbeat, friendly, and you can see they love what they do.

I wish La Fornarina had desserts - specifically cookies.  I miss the saviatta/paste di te cookies of my childhood.

If you love authentic Italian (as opposed to American Italian), you can't do better than La Fornarina."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in this evening for dinner.  Place is small but cute.  The 2 gentleman behind the counter were very attentive and it was very clear they wanted each and every customer to leave happy.  We ordered the Penne Carbonara (American Style) and the Eggplant Parm and BOTH were DELICIOUS!!!  We were impressed with the flavor of the meals and the size of each dish (fairly large!).  Needless to say, we will be back.  Thank you guys!  (By the way - the Canoli's were awesome and we truly appreciate the hospitality!)"}
{"text":"Love this place. Good old fashion Italian food, good prices, good pizza too.
So, many restaurants in this area try to do what they do and slap an expensive price tag to it. 
This place is where you can sit relax and not worry about a thing. The staff is great. 
Go try it, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Been going here 20 yrs, every time in Montreal. Could be the best pizza in the city (although this is a city with lots of great pizza). Everything I've ever had here has been excellent, from the soups to the salads, to especially the pizza, the pasta, you name it. 

There's a reason La Fornarina has been in business 23 years. 

Oh, I didn't mention, the pizza comes out of the wood-fired brick oven; so if you haven't had that before, that alone is reason to go. 

Probably my favorite Italian restaurant in the world, outside of Italy."}
{"text":"Love this place. I kind of stumbled on it by accident, but so glad that I did. The employees are always warm and friendly and the dishes are superb! Keep doing what you do."}
{"text":"Food and service was fantastic 
Bring your own bottle of wine
Do not order the cannolis I need to make sure there's still some left for me 
They were awesome too"}
{"text":"La Fornarina serves up some great, authentic Italian food; the owner is from Sicily. The pasta and the bread are made from scratch and are very good. They use the bread to make pizza and it is light, focaccia bread . This definitely is not the Italian-American greasy pizza and pasta joint. The lasagna I  had was delicious and the cannoli were pretty good. They advertise that everything is made from scratch but unfortunately the cheese sticks were not and they use slimy, canned mushrooms on the pizza. If Dominos. Pizza Hut, and Papa John's can use fresh mushrooms, there is no excuse for this place using canned ones. The chocolate sauce with the cannoli was Hershey's syrup which was also a little disappointing.

The service was a little weird, but good. The location used to be a Donato's and it kind of has that atmosphere. The soda fountain is out front despite waiter service and the kitchen seems larger than the dining area. You can hear everything going on the kitchen which is not always good.They do not serve alcohol, but bring your own.

The lasagna was excellent and inexpensive. The pizza was fresh except for the shrooms and the bread was awesome, plus they were generous with the toppings. The owner and the server were very nice and friendly. Really the only reason this place does not earn 5 stars is because of canned mushrooms and pre-made cheese sticks."}
{"text":"Passez au restaurant suivant si c'est pour une soirée de groupe! Nous sommes 5 à ma table et personne n'aime leur assiette. La salade du chef était n'a aucune goût et contenait qu'une mini pièce de tomate. Je ne vous recommande ni le poulet parmigiana, qui n'a même pas l'air d'être du poulet, et ni les tortellini sauce rosée à moins que vous voulez payer 25$ pour un plat michelinas. Comme si ce n'était pas assez, la serveuse a l'air bête depuis le début."}
{"text":"I saw the reviews and told the wife this is a place we need to try.  When we arrived we couldn't even tell if it was open, but we walked up anyway and they were.  We were greeted and taken to the side of the restaurant and asked for drinks. I asked for tea and the wife ordered water.  Our drinks arrived in the absolute worse fast food restaurant paper cups, but I can make this work.  I took a drink of my tea and it was soured.  It was around 5 and I figured hey between lunch and dinner the tea could have went bad.  I told the waitress and she went to get another cup, then the wife tried her water with lemon and she said it was terrible and yes it was.  My replacement tea came and I tasted it and it was watered down soured tea.  Ok...plan B...Dr. Pepper? Good they had it and it was great for the both of us.  Next up, the food.  My go to for a new Italian place is the calzones so I order the ham with white sauce and cheese and the wife went for the spinach ravioli.  The wait was not long and oh my did it look good on the outside.  My first bite of the deli ham was cool, but the rest was edible.  I unfortunately was not fond of it.  The breading was sweet like a funnel cake.  The wife's spinach ravioli in tomato was was ok, but she only ate half and I choked down my half.  I did not ask for to go boxes and unfortunately I don't see a second chance.  The only reason for two stars was our waitress tried her best."}
{"text":"Spaghetti and meatballs were okay, but restaurant was hot then they turned the ceiling fans off.  Bruschetta was just cheese bread with some tomatoes sprinkled on top.  Bill for six was $100 with tip.  No alcohol, no ambiance, not worth it.  Won't go back."}
{"text":"Tried for the first time.  A bit confusing when you walk in, looks like a place you order at the counter and then grab a seat but if you are eating in they will take your order at a table.  Maybe a sign at the front to seat yourself would help.  There is a buffet that is reasonable but not a lot on it.  I opted for the calzone and it was very good.  Their marinara sauce was really good to go with it.  Service was good, looked like only one guy taking care of the dining room, it worked as it is not very big and it was lunch so not too many large groups.

Overall, good food at a reasonable price, and a place I would return to."}
{"text":"Outstanding authentic Italian, Sicilian cuisine. The arincino(rice balls) were as good as I have ever had. We also had a entree salad with chicken, spaghetti and meatballs, gnocchi and a penne carbonara. All dished were fresh and flavorful. The bread is homemade and fresh baked to order. Huge portions for great prices. We will be regulars from this point forward. a+++"}
{"text":"Hey... BYOB is cool but I wish I had known before I went in.... my bad bro....

Maybe it was because it was super busy on a Saturday night in the Little Italy section of Montreal , but service at this place was a sketchy experience. The waitress was nice enough to warn us ahead of time that things would be slow, but to be honest she made it seem worse then it ended up being, wasn't GREAT, but wasnt a catastrophe either.

The look of the place on the inside isnt really.....enticing.... real 80's basic look... lots of brown every which way... oh well I aint an interior decorater so what the heck do I know...

Had ceasar salad to start... it was.... salady.... nothing special... just, salad. Followed it up with the ( i'm about to butcher the spelling) Stratchitella soup, which was definately not bad at all so things were looking up. 

For my main I had the penne arribata (spelling again I know) and again the flavour went up a notch here, the best part about this was that at other places i've ordered this dish, the heat kinda blows my tasebuds out of wack and ruins flavor for me, this wasn't the case here, real good sauce... well cooked pasta which i doubt was fresh tho... but i'm not horrible picky. So it was not BAD, but nothing i'd keep coming back for...."}
{"text":"Best pasta in Fort Mill! Have now tried their Spaghetti and Meatballs, Chicken Parm and Penne Lafornarina and they were all incredible (delicious sauce and flavors with ample portions). They also have the best bread and we are looking forward to trying more. Kind of odd to have two Italian restaurants in the same shopping center but this is definitely the better option for pasta. I have yet to try their pizza but would like to try and compare to Danny's, which is great NY style pizza. I just don't think Danny's comes close with their pasta (have tried their spaghetti and lasagna there) so definitely go to LaFornarina for authentic Italian cuisine!"}
{"text":"This is a really strange review.  The food itself is 5 star all the way.  Great salads, great pasta.  If you like sicilian food, you will love it.  The problem is that some of the presentation is a little \"low-rent\" for the food.  Problem #1...Tea and soda served in paper cups.  This is not McDonalds.  Invest in some plastic or glass glasses or just get a higher grade of disposable cups.  Problem #2 - No wine or beer.  At Italian restaurant?  Problem #3 - Some of the salad dressings were made there and they were delicious.  Others were commercial and served in pouches, like they have at...McDonalds again.  Problem #4 - Maybe just a bad night when we arrived, but they seemed to be understaffed.  We will be going back for sure, but we'd like to see improvement."}
{"text":"Don't let the ambiance fool you. It looks like a regular take out pizza joint, but the food and service is top notch. It looks like you order at the counter, but they waited on us at our table of choice. I had the Penne Carbonara which was fresh, flavorful and seasoned perfectly. Wife had spaghetti and meatballs which was just like grandma from the old country use to make. Had to try a piece of pizza to see what everyone was talking about. It was delicious. Just like I use to get in Palermo. The portions are large so be prepared to get stuffed or take home for another meal tomorrow. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Service was a bit slow tonight, but food, as usual, was spot on!..everything, pizza, arancino, carbonera, parm....try it!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! We ordered the penne Alfredo and it was the best I've ever had. I don't know how they cook the chicken, but it was hands down the best! Please give this place a try"}
{"text":"The food is good, but they need help running the business. I ordered for pick up and they said it would take 45 minutes. I showed up at 45 minutes and waited an additional 45 minutes. When I got home and pulled out food, I was missing the garlic cheese bread. It was so chaotic there, that I didn't bother calling about it. Overall, the food is good and totally affordable. I hope they succeed, but they need better management and organization."}
{"text":"OMG the Dough for the pizza and stromboli is AMAZING! The Fornarina Pizza is my favorite!! The smell of this place makes my mouth water... and the Tiramisu-- is delish! This is not fancy place but good. This wins in my book evertime. The details should be the food first, fancy never means its good! FABULOUS work La Fornarina!"}
{"text":"A nice choice for cozy warm cooking in a family atmosphere - a few other restaurants in Little Italy could learn from the lack of pretension and stress in here, it truly feels mellow and welcoming. The huge brick hearth in the room, the two floors with soft clear lighting, the open staircase and windows, all this may have something to do with an overall feeling off well-being in here. The pasta isn't wildly memorable, but you get a very tasty mound of it and leave fed, that's for sure. Dean A's review is dead on: Fornarina is providing soul food, and they are climbing up my list for where to eat when it's cold out."}
{"text":"First time in 15 years I left no tip at a restaurant. I went alone so I guess they were not interested in a single party. 

I did not have an actual waiter. I have no idea who the old guy in an apron was that served me. Someone brought me a bread with no butter or oil. Someone else brought me a can of soda. I had to request a glass! The pizza I ordered had so much cheese it was gross. 

I should have followed my instincts and walked out when I saw the place. Bright cafeteria lights, Marriott convention chairs, cheese ball paintings. No greeting or indication of what to do upon entering. 

Just a very unwelcoming experience."}
{"text":"It is a blessing and a curse that this place has opened up just a couple minutes from my house. I absolutely adore the food! My new life goal is to sample every item on their menu and everything I have tried so far is absolutely amazing. The secret as far as I can tell is simple - fresh pasta and light sauces and don't drown it all in cheese like an unfortunate amount of Italian places do. 

The restaurant is located at the end of a shared building and has an unassuming air. The most expensive item on the menu rings in at $15 for the delicious lobster ravioli. This restaurant has introduced me to a new favorite food, arancino, which is a scrumptious fried ball with a rice and mozzarella base. The side of meatballs is probably the best item we have found on the menu so far. We all greedily forked them and dipped the fresh free bread that comes with the meals in the leftover sauce.

The restaurant delivers amazing food with friendly service at a reasonable price. My carb consumption is going to skyrocket with such a great place so close to my house."}
{"text":"Une étoile car il s'agit d'un restaurant très sale,je ne peux pas comprendre que le propriétaire peut être fiere de la tenu de son resto.
Aucun italien dans ce resto seulement des gens de d'autre origine car je ne crois pas que un italien qui se respecte s'y présenterais"}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service, owner is always there and friendly. All of the pasta dishes are unique and well made with good flavor. Pizza is Sicilian style but excellent dough. Definitely recommend nice to see a place like this in fort mill"}
{"text":"Best freaking sauce ever! Pizza is not my style but I always get the chicken parm which is incredible."}
{"text":"We tried three different menu items plus dessert! We will definitely be back.The food was fantastic! Super nice owner and staff."}
{"text":"Food is awesome and taste just like the food in Italy! The staff is super nice and friendly!"}
{"text":"Excellent Italian Food - The Pizza was amazing - Not just your ordinary pizza pie - it was fresh and perfect - Just try it for yourself and you will see - The spaghetti and meatballs - amazing - The sauce and meatballs - perfect - Meatball sandwich and chicken parm sandwich - again excellent - The owners are wonderful and very friendly folks - definitely a nice welcome to Fort Mill - I wish you all well - Great New place and Im there at least twice a week now...."}
{"text":"The setting is plain.  The food ordinary.  I understand the low stars as well as the comments attached.  Did I order the wrong dish?  Maybe.  I try to give restaurants like this a chance in case it was a bad night.  On a Tuesday night, I'm really not sure why it took so long to get my food.  However I did notice they seem to only have 1 server."}
{"text":"The food here was really great and the service was good too. My husband had the manicotti with some meatballs and I had the veggie panini. Everything was so delicious with generous portions. The bread...amazing! We came with a big group from church (about 25). The layout isn't suited well for large groups but they accommodated us really well. Our food all came out quickly even though I think there was only one server and one cook in the whole place. I was really impressed and will be back when I am in the mood for delicious authentic Italian food."}
{"text":"Got take out for myself and the wife.  It's pizza parlor quality Italian. Not great but not terrible.  We got Spaghetti and meatballs and chicken parm.   Portions were very generous and the price was fair. Would have liked it to come with salad but I could have ordered it if I really wanted it.  Staff was friendly especially the owner.

For the price it's a decent meal, but it is not the exceptional Italian restaurant that my wife and I are still looking for in this area."}
{"text":"I'm Italian. This place rocks. Big portions, great hospitality, perfect sauce. I ordered take out.  The chicken parmigiana panini sandwich is excellent. They have pizza on focaccia bread which I will try next. Give them a try. The owner just came from Sicily but speaks perfect English. 

November 2016. Unfortunately this restaurant went out of business."}
{"text":"First, let me state that I really, REALLY wanted to like La Fornarina. I love supporting local businesses and based on the reviews I was expecting an outstanding meal. I think from our experience, La Fornarina is a victim of their early success and our visit reflected this.

My wife and I were looking to try some local Italian as we don't want to have to drive uptown or to South Park every time we want quality food. Based on the Y! reviews, La Fornarina seemed like a no brainer.

The restaurant itself is a little wonky in how it's laid out. When you walk in, you're in front of the counter area where there's a table or two. Then, in an L shape around the kitchen, there are tables along the outside wall and into the back. This means that a big part of the restaurant has tables lined up along the wall/windows down a corridor. A couple of the tables are offset/positioned weirdly due to pillars.

We were seated when we arrived and the waitress took our drink orders. What's a little unusual is that while the waitress brought us our drinks, she retrieved them from the soda fountain which is in the middle of the floor. Not sure if it's supposed to be self service? It's a little confusing. Also, due to how close the soda machine is to the tables, I found myself having to talk over the roar of the ice maker.

After about 10 minutes waiting after our drinks were delivered, we placed our order. As with a first visit to any new restaurant, my wife and I try and order a cross section of what the menu has to offer. We ordered a Chef's Salad (which is La Fornarina's closest offering to an Antipasto Salad), my wife had the baked Penne and I ordered a Pizza.

Twice before our actual food arrived, we were brought the incorrect order which was intended for another table. Eventually our Salad arrived. While served on one giant plate, we were not given salad plates and my wife and I had to lean in and try and share the one plate. The Italian Dressing that came with the salad tasted like something from a bottle. I found it odd they didn't offer a red Italian house dressing?

The Baked Penne was a bit of a let down. Most \"baked\" pasta meals come served in the ramekin they were baked in as to preserve the cheese crust and the heat. The presentation at La Fornarina was a HUGE portion (a positive for some, but it was a bit much) with the crusted cheese slumped over to one side. 

The pizza that was originally brought to the table was only a slice, which I had to clarify to the waiter that we ordered a full Pizza. They corrected the issue and let us keep the slice on the house to make right. The pizza itself I actually like, but for a specific reason. The crust reminded a LOT of Stouffer's French Bread Pizza that I used to make all the time growing up. Good or bad, this is EXACTLY what it tasted like to my wife and I.

We were brought our to-go containers (white styrofoam containers for pizza? no pizza boxes?) and we waited. After asking for our check we were told we needed to go up to the counter to pay. Thank god we asked or we might have been sitting there for a while!

All that being said, this wasn't BAD food. It was good (but not outstanding) and the wait staff was very friendly and attentive when we could grab their attention.

The reason I'm giving La Fornarina two stars is that this wasn't a five star experience and I expected better from a place with such a rating. I feel it was due to how busy they were. As I said in my opening, they seem to be a victim of their own success. They were under staffed for a full house and seemed disorganized for a Saturday night crowd. I feel because of the rush, food quality probably suffered.

The items that disappointed us, I feel, are correctable. Perhaps we'll give it another go in a couple months when they find their groove."}
{"text":"We decided to come here for lunch a couple of weeks ago during a weekday. It's a small place but seems to serve authentic Italian. After a late night of drinking, we were looking for he heavy stuff. They offer a small lunch buffet but I wasn't interested, it wasn't too impressive with a dry tray of lasagna, some veggies, and fried potatoes. The cashier was very nice and helpful. 

We ordered a fried calzone, gnocchi with butter sauce, and a chicken parmesan plate. The fried Calzone came out piping hot with complementary garlic focaccia, I would have never bought the Calzone had I known they provided carbs free of charge. I was pretty much full when the brought out the gnocchi and chicken parm. I sadly was not too impressed. I love gnocchi but this dish was drenched in sage butter. I couldn't get through all of it without having a heart attack, I eventually had to drain out all of the butter to make the gnocchi somewhat edible. A marinara sauce or alfredo sauce would make the dish edible at the very least. I also didn't like the chicken parm, the marinara sauce was soooo bland. I had to douse the dish with red pepper flakes, garlic and dried oregano which were provided near the drink dispenser. Basically, our meal wasn't as satisfying as I had hoped it would be. 

The Calzone was my favorite part of the dish and the service was my favorite part of our visit to La Fornarina. I may try this place one more time for accuracy's sake."}
{"text":"This storefront Italian Restaurant reminds me of the Mom and Pop Restaurants in Hoboken before gentrification. Simple dishes very well made with fresh ingredients. Not too fancy and no gimmicks. The staff is friendly and dedicated. We enjoyed the chicken parmigiana (my son says the eggplant parmigiana is even better). I had a perfectly prepared calzone and the pizza is fresh made on focaccia. BYOB of a nice red wine for a casual, relaxing meal."}

Decent price, good service, nice people"}
