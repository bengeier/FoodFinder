{"text":"Excellent food and service, enjoyed the all you can eat salad bar and the loaf!  I'm a big seafood fan and it was very fresh and well prepared.. glad I stumbled upon this place, will go again."}
{"text":"This is the 2nd time at this restaurant and while pretty good the first time this second time was sadly disappointing. First, we would not go here had we not purchased a coupon of some kind, both times for us we purchased them through Wagjag. The reason is that while the food is good, the menu selection is very slim, the prices very high and the ambiance mediocre. As stated the food is quite good but the ambiance, decor, service do not measure up to the high prices. For example, paper napkins, one set of cutlery on the table for all courses, no bread & butter plate, appetizer brought that was being shared with no plates for which to place it, the waitress asking us when she brought the hot butter for the lobster who was having the lobster when there were only 2 of us at the table.  The meal started with me ordering a half litre of white wine only to learn that there was only enough left of that wine for one glass. We then ordered our meals, helped ourselves to the good but skimpy salad bar, then getting my own plates from the salad bar for side plates once the warm bread arrived, asking for more bread only to hear that it would be a charge of $3 for 4 pieces of bread (to which we kindly said \"no thank-you\") and then having our dinners set in front of us (and having to ask for cutlery as we sent our dirty stuff away with our salad plates) and each seeing only a tablespoon of their incredibly delicious mashed potatoes on our plates. I no sooner finished commenting about this to my husband when the waitress came back with a plate of FRENCH FRIES saying the chef apologized for \"running out of potatoes\" and sent the fries out to make up for it.  The last straw was when I had a piece of my steak left and told the waitress I would take it to go.  She proceeded to pick up my husband's dirty plate and left mine in front of me; I moved it off to the side.  She came back to the table with the take out container and proceeded to ask me if I wanted her to put the steak in it - she did this at the table!!!  I realize that unless you've been to this restaurant some of these things may seem petty but you have to understand that many of these issues stem from the fact that you're paying top dollar for the food and therefore should receive top service and ambiance.  In the future if I want steak and/or seafood, I will go to the Keg or Wildfire Steak & Wine Bar for the same or better prices, a larger selection, experienced wait staff, and all the bread I can eat."}
{"text":"Got a coupon from a group buy site and visited with a party of 4.   Made reservations beforehand. The hostess was very pleasant and showed us to our seats upon arrival. The place is pretty tiny.   I had a lot of problems with the ambiance. It's very dim inside and the front of the restaurant was all glass with no curtains or blinds. The sunlight was blinding me so badly that I couldn't see the faces of the people sitting in front of me.   Started off with a couple of appetizers which which out waitress recommended. Fried cocktail shrimp and mango lobster salad.  We were not disappointed. Good flavours, the chef definitely knows how to cook seafood.   For my entry I had surf and turf. The steak was just okay. The lobster tail was delicious.  I would return for the lobster but only if I had a coupon. I find it a bit pricy and the location is really out of my way.  If I was rating on seafood alone it would be a 4.5 but with the bad ambiance and okay steak, I give it a 3."}
{"text":"**1/2 stars  The Lobster House is hidden in a strip plaza on Kingston Road in Pickering.  We actually drove right by it because they do not have a sign on the plaza's plaque.The restaurant reminded me of Leonardo DiCaprio in Titanic when he is invited to dinner in the first class deck.  While he certainly dressed the part, when dinnertime came, he could no longer hide the fact that he was just a pretender.  The Lobster House is the same.  You enter the restaurant with a faux fireplace, which sits below a round logo-ed sign with the restaurant's name and a LCD monitor beaming images of the restaurants dishes.  The chairs, table, paintings and Kenny G music playing in the background would lead you to believe that you are in a fine dining establishment.  Once you sit down, you feast your eyes upon a paper place mat that would only be fitting in a mom and pop restaurant listing the daily specials.  It was tacky.  Almost as tacky as the faux greens they had as centrepieces.  We hadn't even so much as taken off our jackets yet when the hostess read off the specials in a hit-and-run fashion.  The all-you-can-eat salad and dessert bar is amusing with 8 plates and 4 ice cream flavours to choose from.  It was almost as amusing as the look on our faces when we were told that in order to access said bar that both parties had to order an entrée or a $20 fee would apply.  Are you kidding me?  Twenty dollars plus some change could get me a full-blown buffet dinner at the Mandarin!  Other than this little tidbit of feeling rushed, the service for the rest of the night was great.  After having placed our orders we hovered over to the salad bar.  We were glad we opted for an entrée instead of paying the $20 fee.  This was highway robbery!  The slim pickings consisted of: olives, cheese, Caesar salad, coleslaw, shrimp and mango salad, mashed potato, mixed greens salad, and herb-marinated mussels.  Complimentary, warm bread was brought out with a savoury garlic and herb butter.  This went perfectly with our scallops appetizer which was served in a lemon and herb sauce - perfect for dipping.  The bite-size bay scallops were not overcooked, but lacked the juiciness and tenderness when pegged up against its sea scallops counterpart.  For mains we opted for a 3-pound whole cracked Nova Scotian lobster which came with a side of creamy and luscious mashed potato and perhaps one of the most flavourful side vegetables I have sampled in a restaurant.  For those of you who are lazy, I would probably opt for the lobster tail instead because eating lobster is really a question of skill.  I was lucky enough that my dining companion was skilled in the art of deconstructing a lobster, otherwise, some of it may have gone to waste.  I am lazy when it comes to eating, if I have to work too hard I usually throw my hands up and surrender. This lobster died for a good cause, as by the time we were done there was not one ounce of anything remotely edible left on our beady-eyed crustacean.  I bow down to thee WT - grand master lobster eater!   When it comes to lobster, its really a matter of preference.  I personally like my lobster in the 2 to 2.5 pound range, as I find the meat is the most succulent at this size range.  The 3-pounder that we feasted on was a little more steak-like in that the meat was more firm.  The Jambalaya dish we tried was a pasta rendition, and was quite yummy albeit inauthentic.  The pasta was cooked to a perfect al dente and adorned with a generous medley of seafood.  However, other than the seafood part of the dish, I don't see how one could call this a Jambalaya.  There was no holy trinity of celery, peppers or onions, nor any sign of sausage, tomato or vegetables.  Verdict:  The Lobster House has a lot of potential in becoming a fine dining restaurant.  First and foremost, the signage needs a huge overhaul.  Even my local convenience store's sign is more enticing and attractive.  Next, they need to humble up and lower their prices just a tad.  Everything has its place.  Their prices are in line with some of Toronto's restaurants located in prime real estate locations (e.g. Yorkville), which just seems a tad high for a restaurant located in a strip plaza in Pickering."}
{"text":"I travelled nearly an hour to visit The Lobster House because a friend of mine got a TeamBuy voucher for Christmas.  For a really small restaurant located in a strip mall in Pickering, their entrées are quite pricy. I had the cajun salmon with mashed potatoes and vegetables. Each entrée came with an all-you-can-eat salad bar. The salads were quite good, although there was a very limited selection (pasta salad, caesar, and green olives from what I can remember). Each table also receives a loaf of seasoned bread to start. This was also very good. When it came to the entrée, however, I was disappointed to find that the standouts of the dish were the vegetables and the mashed potatoes. Those were mouth-watering - delicious. The cajun salmon was solid, but it just didn't have the standout quality that I expect from a $$$ rated restaurant. Can't give more than 3 stars when the entrée wasn't the best part of the meal!  The service was standard - nothing overly impressive and definitely nothing bad. I'd recommend for people who live in the area to check it out (and to try the lobster, it's probably called The Lobster House for a reason). Give the salmon a shot if you want, but don't expect anything outstanding."}
{"text":"Update  We have eaten at The Lobster House a number of times, always using a voucher.  Loved our first experience; food was excellent, service very good.  The \"salad bar\" has always left something to be desired, as it is extremely limited.  Subsequent visits were fairly decent.  Our last visit was the worst.  My \"Mojito\" was the worst excuse for a Mojito I've ever tasted - so sour that I had to add sugar, and no mint flavour whatsoever.  My husband's cocktail (can't remember at the moment what it was) was so sweet  he couldn't drink it.  Soup was served cold.  Hubby's lobster was good (it always is), and my steak and lobster tail quite enjoyable.  The servings of melted butter supplied for the lobster and lobster tail were absolutely pathetic - so tiny!  To top it off, when we tried to order white wine we were told they had run out!    OK, then I'll have a Merlot with my steak...no, think again, no wine available WHATSOEVER!.  Apparently they never stock more than 3 bottles of red and 3 of white (and didn't have time to go to the LCBO)...seriously???  We decided to opt for ice cream from the \"salad bar\" for dessert, but the water in the containers where the ice cream scoops were kept was so disgusting that we changed our minds.    Service did not live up to what we have been used to at this restaurant (very spotty and no one remembered anything).  Even with a voucher, our bill for this disappointing evening was well over $100, and we deserved better.  Has anyone looked at the going price for lobster lately?  Next time we'll cook our own and you can be sure it will be served with a good bottle of wine.  It is doubtful that we will ever return to the Lobster House, voucher or not, unless and until we start seeing consistently good reviews."}
{"text":"found this restaurant by accident. boy am I glad I did! the food here is OUTSTANDING. the lobster and fish are so perfectly cooked. the entree might seem expensive but you get all you can eat salad, buns and Ice cream plus the amazing quality of the food the price is very reasonable. the archive is good,, but not enough wait staff makes service negligible. but the wait staff are still very pleasant and nice. two thumbs up! I'll definitely be back again"}
