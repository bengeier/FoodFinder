{"text":"Went in a group n honestly better than expected good jobbbb m a fan now... They did do some improvements it used to be shityy"}
{"text":"Great pub in Montreal. We stopped here to take a break from the cold temperature outside and ended up staying for 3 hours. The snacks were delish and the beer selection was limited but what ever they had was wonderful. We ate before stopping here but wish we didn't... Everything we saw on other peoples table looked and smelled amazing!!!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed it- went on a quiet Sunday afternoon. Had some good beer and food. More upscale food than the usual pub, jerk chicken wings, eggplant pasta- all was tasty. A bit high priced but not unreasonable. Nice new addition to Mile End."}
{"text":"I just love this place. It became my favorite  neighborhood pub right after it opened and I have spent countless evenings and mornings there. The staff is very friendly, the beer selection is decent (though a bit expensive) and the food is amazing. They do a very good gin tonic using their house tonic and Piger Henricus gin, and my recommendation for brunch would be the Earl of Dalhousie - a breakfast dal with cheese curds, poached egg and fried vegetables. It may sound like a strange combo, but it is so delicious!"}
{"text":"An awesome English pub here! The bartender in this pub does more than his job to involve people who come alone like me. Tried the burger when I came and it was amazing! Must visit this pub if you'd like to try some English beer that this pub has."}
{"text":"By far the greatest pub in town. The most extensive gin collection I've ever seen, incredibly delicious food, tasty cocktails, decadent dessert, and friendly staff. It feels like a home away from home."}
{"text":"Amazing brunch, friendly staff and delicious house beer. Wandered in here searching for a place to have a beer and ended up eating bc everything we saw looked delicious. Highly recommend for a casual bite / drink."}
{"text":"If you are a gin drinker, this is your spot. Serves over a 160 different brands. My friend Veronica poked at me so I decided to venture from my usual vodka on the rocks and opt for a bourbon based drink. The \"Lucky Ginger\" cocktail is delicious. Friendly pub with great service and music jamming til 3am in the morning."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stumbled upon this place while walking around the area looking for breakfast that also took credit cards. We were SO impressed with the quality of food for the price. 

They definitely had the best Benedict we've ever tasted. He ordered the special Benedict which had pork cheek, roasted tomato, cheese and a delicious pesto-hollandaise. I ordered \"the yank\" which was the yummiest basic breakfast I've ever had. The eggs were cooked perfect, the sausages were savory and succulent and the potatoes were like hash browns but pressed into a triangle shaped nugget that made them way better than normal. 

I really wish this place was closer to home because I would totally go to brunch here every weekend. It was that good! Please give this place a try if you are in the area. It is most definitely worth it :)

Thank you Bishop and Bagg for an amazing Saturday brunch!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent pour un 5 à 7 avec des collègues comme pour une soirée entre amis. Bon choix de burgers, de bières et de spiritueux. Une référence dans le quartier."}
{"text":"Every once in a while I find myself daydreaming about their crabcakes. The channa and scramble breakfast, the sweet hospitality of our waiter....
I love Canadians"}
{"text":"There's finally a solid British style pub (think Burgundy Lion) on the plateau. Open 7 days a week till 3am, this place might become a go to! 

This place delivers exactly what it promises: British favourites with a great bar selection in a casual pub-style environment. 

They offer both British style brunch and lunch/dinner, and both are pretty good. At Brunch, I had the curried lentils, poached eggs, cheese curds & toast, while my husband had the full English. I have to say both were great! The coffee, not so much though, but hey that's what you get for ordering a latte in a pub. Next time, perhaps I'll try the Clamato-vodka, which seems to be a crowd favourite here during brunch. I also highly suggest the crumpets, which were still warm from the oven. 

They also have a decent lunch & dinner menu. We tried the lamb kebabs, which were just ok, and a green salad, which was nice. 

Finally if you're looking for a place to watch an English football game or even hockey, this is really a nice option."}
{"text":"Dans la plus pure tradition des pubs anglais.
Ambiance chaude et enveloppante avec un cadre fait de bois.
Côté alcool il y a un large choix de bières mais pas seulement. Les amateurs de vins et de cocktails seront aussi comblés. Les old fashions sont disponibles et il ne faut pas hésiter à demander.
Côté bouffe c'est une version pub améliorée avec truite, choux et plein d'autres découvertes.
À faire pour une ambiance entre amis, pour boire et manger sur place que ce soit au comptoir ou à table.
Hâte d'y retourner !!!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood pub. The neighborhood needed this, it is quite refreshing! Great atmosphere, nice beers on tap, nice menu. I had the smoked trout, was fantastic. Did not notice and TV's, hope they will be showing Habs games!"}
{"text":"Mile End may not of needed another British pub (The Sparrow is two streets away) however, Bishop & Bagg do things the traditional British way by ordering food and drinks at the bar and they bring it to your seat. 

The inside is all dark wood with a great looking bar and a nice selection of scotch and whiskey. I drank their House Ale and it was mediocre BUT the food made up for it. I got the onion \"soup\" (not a soup) and it was delicious. I could of eaten three of them. My boyfriend had the quail with mash and he thought it was great. The only bummer is that we were both hungry after we left. 

Although the food is good, this is more of a drinking pub by the looks of it. Not that many people were eating when we went. I've been to Burgundy Lion and they are not afraid of promoting alcoholism in St. Henri (as if you have to). So I don't see how Bishop & Bagg won't become the next Mile End (a more high end version at least) watering hole. 

It'll be a great spot in the summer when they open up that front window and I go to enjoy a pint."}
{"text":"This was a very nice bar.  We had bourbons, beers and small snacks and spent the entire night here.  The service was very attentive, if not a little too attentive (I thought about inviting the busser to join us he spent so much time leaning over the table).  We had a very good time though.  A little pricy, but appropriate for the atmosphere."}
{"text":"We enjoyed a wonderful brunch today!  We were all pleasantly surprised, at just how tasty the brunch selection we had was.  We had the English breakfast, the earl of dalhousie and the corn beef hash.  Amazing taste,a good portion and affordable.  We were very pleased with the service.  She was very pleasant and helpful. We will be back"}
{"text":"I came by with my work crew to have a drink or 2 and I was not at all disappointed! The gin list is out of this world amazing, great cocktails and vibes we're great! Extremely friendly staff and I'll definitely be going to back to try some food."}
{"text":"I have been there many times and I just like it more and more every time. Great food, super friendly service, and well decorated. Plus the neighborhood is fun to walk around. One of my favorite favorite neighborhood spots."}
{"text":"Wasn't expecting much from this British Pub but the house burger was great. It was juicy and had bacon and cheese on it and came with potatoes smothered in some sort of wonderful sauce. We sat near the outdoor area and had a great time. Friendly staff, great hangout."}
{"text":"Fantastic!
Situated on one of the busiest streets in The Mile End is this upscale pub. A previous yelper had written great reviews on the brunch menu and my fiancé and I had to grab a bite before leaving Montreal back to Toronto. We drove all the way from old Montreal for this brunch.
WORTH IT!
The brunch menu was SMALL only 4 items but we had been eating eggs Benedict across Montreal so far so we figured why stop.
Delicious and the salad on the side was phenomenal! 
Will 100% be back next time we are in Montreal, to try a burger - as this looked to be even more delicious.

My only advice if you're visiting The Mile End area - is that local street parking is a tad confusing - make sure you read the signs carefully!"}
{"text":"Stumbled across this spot while trying to take a break from the rain on a Sunday night. Wasn't sure what to expect, but we wanted a drink or two, and the menu on the outside looked promising. The country music playing worried us a bit, but the playlist transitioned into some classic hip hop which was more our speed. We sat at the bar and the super nice staff welcomed us and took our orders. Not too hungry, we just shared the Mile End Bangers: Homemade sausage, smashed potatoes, homemade ketchup, arugula, and fennel with some kind of sweet balsamic dressing maybe? Long story short, it was surprisingly really good. The homemade sausage tasted delicious, but the story was about everything surrounding it: the homemade ketchup tasted like some kind of tomato marmalade, the arugula with the balsamic was fresh and tasty, and the potatoes provided the perfect starchy balance. Clearly the folks in the kitchen care about what they're cooking. Also had a couple whiskys, enjoyed the quaint and slightly quirky ambience, and overall had a nice experience. Will definitely come back and try some of the other dishes!"}
{"text":"Sympathique Pub anglais. Je vous recommande de partager les assiettesbon choix de bières. N'oubliez pas les noix!"}
{"text":"Good spot for a variety of purposes. Nice set-up, calm atmosphere and quality food. Yes this is a gastropub with all of the trimmings. As an example, it has a gin list as long as the grocery list of an octo-mom. 

The food menu is inspired by fresh, good quality ingredients, which definitely cannot be said for most pub food (hence my gastropub label). 

I've said this before about other pubs (e.g. rebel house and their blackened chicken salad): you wouldn't think to order a salad at a pub but I LOVED the Bhaji rama, a mixture of kale, squash, onion bhajis, pomegranate and pumpkin seeds. Scrumptious."}
{"text":"Came to this English pub on a Sunday night for their weekly trivia night and had a blast. The food had a pretty good quality to price ratio and included a variety of large portioned English fare. I ordered a Bloody Caesar and was glad that I did, it was one of the tastiest Caesars I've had in a while. The Caesar was decadently covered in green beans, olives, a pickle, and a delicious sour and salty rim. I highly recommend going to their trivia night if you're down for a casual fun Sunday night (starts at 8:30pm). There are two rounds and the winner of each round wins $50 off of their tab."}
{"text":"Location: Corner of St. Viateur Ouest and Clark. The closest subway is probably Laurier (orange) or you can take the 55 bus up St. Laurent from downtown and walk over. Street parking is available but metered and hard to come by unless you get there early on weekends (parking is free on Sundays until 1pm and you can usually find a spot on the main).

The place: It's your typical pub-style decor - cozy. They have a small terrace with about 6 tables or so. We sat outside. We got there around 11 a.m. on a Saturday and had no problem getting a table.

The goods: I wouldn't say these guys have typical pub fare, which is nice because really, who wants the same old, same old? My date had the trout, which, by the way, is served whole - so be prepared to work for it. He thought it was great, but was less enthused about having to de-bone it. The serving was pretty healthy and comes with spinach and kale (I think). On my end, I had the English breakfast (not on the menu) and really enjoyed it. My (scrambled) eggs were perfect and flavorful, the hash browns were AMAZING (I had to slap my date's hand a few times for trying to steal them), and I really liked the blood sausage (for those of you who read my reviews, you know I'm not a meat eater so that's kinda saying a lot).  Overall, we had a great brunch experience. Note that our waitress told us about breakfast/brunch options that weren't on the menu. I'm not sure if this is because they're only served on weekends.

Service: Our waitress was really friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.

Price point: I didn't pay (YAY!) but I think the total was about $40 for two people."}
{"text":"First thing to mention is I did not have any food here but the smells coming from the kitchen were interesting. We went there for a beer after work. Looking that the menu, we decided to try the house beer, the 3 of us thinking we'll try it and then switch to another, more known beer. 

We were so surprised with the house beer that we all ended up taking only the house beer and 3 glasses of it each. The house beer we took was a blonde and the taste was soft but refreshing. Well worth the price."}
{"text":"Ordered their Ploughman's Lunch off Foodora. 

I live 5 mins away. 

A Ploughman's Lunch is not even a prepared meal. It's literally a bunch of ingredients arranged on a plate. 

It arrived at my spot 1h 45 min minutes later. Seemed kinda stale, like it had spent most of that time just sitting there waiting for...something. Cost me $15 plus delivery. 

Don't patronize these chuckleheads for delivery--they're not equipped to take your simple order."}
{"text":"Perfect Classic pub, the host is Amazing, the decor fits with the concept. They have the best pub food menu in Town. Classic cocktails are perfectly executed and they have a large Spirit selection. You can easily understand that this bar is run by real industry professionals. One of my best choice in town"}
{"text":"Super place pour un brunch qui change de l'ordinaire! Large choix de plein de choses variées et qui ont l'air toutes excellentes!!
Le bol de lentilles au curi est vraiment bon, c'est comme une grosse soupe, avec des oeufs pochés dedans, et un très bon goût d'épices variées
Les croquettes de crabes sont délicieuses aussi
Par contre, on n'a pas trop aimé le jus d'orange pressé
Sinon, beau décor, beau service.. A essayer!"}
{"text":"Girlfriend and I came for a weekend getaway from Toronto. Saw this place from outside walking and came in to nothing but smiling staff and a warm welcome. Drinks served right away, got the Chana scramble and she had the grilled cheese.. being foodies they were dope! Glad we visited!"}
{"text":"Food was great!
Selection of drinks, especially Bourbon/Irish Whiskey/Gin, was excellent.
Atmosphere is bussling and casual but an older crowd.
Staff is nice but no extra mile.

Made reservations for my husband and I on a Saturday night and the food was amazing. You don't really need a reservation for dinner per se but it helps as this place fills up pretty quickly after 9 pm. I HIGHLY recommend the bourban \"tea\" cocktail, spiced nuts, buffala starter (!!!so good) and the jerk chicken plate. The chicken plate comes with enough chicken for two people fyi and jalapeno stuffed mac & cheese! Both excellent. My husband got the beef pie - flavours were right on the money but the texture of the pie was not .. The burger of the day looked amazing too but we didn't order it. Overall the food was great, not what you expect for a \"pub\" in a good way - it turned out to be more of a gastro-pub even though the atmosphere definitely suggests lesser quality/creative food. We were very pleasantly surprised.

They lose a star because we felt like we were being rushed out after our meal for a group of 3 people who were very obviously being rude to the manager when they first walked in...which was confusing for us. We had ordered more than 70$ worth of drinks alone at that point + food and showed no sign of slowing down so we didn't really understand why our business was less valuable. We walked out because we felt like they wanted us to which never leaves a good taste in your mouth. If the clientele etiquette was there, this would have been a perfect review!"}
{"text":"I'm not going to comment on the \"British\" theme. 
I'm going to comment on the brunch menu - which I've had several times and is an interesting menu that is more dynamic than the standard eggs, toast, potatoes. So that in itself is a treat. Crab cakes with poached eggs is so delicious. Crispy crab cakes and perfectly poached eggs. One time the bread on the side was stale - but that was mentioned to the server and immediately rectified. The dahlhousie is also delicious. A great fancy grilled cheese too. Really enjoy eating brunch at this place and often there's so many things that sound great on the menu I want to try them all. 
Went for dinner once - wasn't bowled over by the menu choices so opted safe with the burger and it was ok. Nothing to write home about and if i was having a burger craving it wouldn't be one I would go to. However once again, their brunch menu and food is A+"}
{"text":"At the end of the menu it is advised to say if you have food allergies only for the waitress to give you attitude if asked for an ingredient to be taken out of your plate. Poor service, average food. I wouldn't ever go again or recommend it to anybody."}
{"text":"Nouveau petit pub qui vient diversifier l'offre nocturne dans le coin du Mile End. J'étais bien emballée à l'idée d'aller l'essayer, ce que j'ai fait un jeudi soir avant d'aller à un concert au Cabaret du Mile End. 

C'est peut-être parce que j'ai grandi parmi beaucoup de pubs anglais à Ottawa, mais j'ai trouvé que celui-ci sonnait un peu... faux. Déjà, en rentrant, la première chose qu'on nous dit c'est qu'ils font le service à l'anglaise, c'est-à-dire qu'il faut commander au bar. C'est pas tant le fait qu'ils ne faisaient pas le service aux tables qui m'a dérangé, mais surtout le ton pompeux que le serveur a pris. Mais bon, hein, c'est pas grave!

Deuxième point plus négatif : le prix de la pinte. Je veux dire, 8,5$ pour une pinte de Newcastle, c'est vraiment trop, come on. Celui qui m'accompagnait était vraiment très heureux de pouvoir commander un Pimm's cup, et c'est vrai qu'il était vraiment bon!

Troisièmement, la déco n'était pas pleinement assumée, et j'avais l'impression de me retrouver dans un décor de pub anglais plutôt que dans un vrai pub anglais. Ça faisait un peu étrange...

Mais bon, l'expérience en soit était pas négative, et peut-être que j'y retournerais! Le menu avait l'air bien tentant."}
{"text":"Great service and food! Emily is the best, we are visiting from out of town and we felt right at home. Amazing knowledge of the specialty drinks and she recommended an amazing scotch, red breast whiskey..."}
{"text":"I'll expand on this after taking in a Sunday brunch.  I popped in on a quiet afternoon and had biscuits, ribs and a pint.  Right on the money.  And do bow-wow have a new destination for extended dog walks.

I like it.  It has a cool intimate vibe.  

The terrace will work but it'll never get sun.  :(

Definitely gets a follow-up and brunch

Extended report to come"}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants. Simple dishes with lots of flavour. I always get the Bhaji Rama .( kale, squash, onion bhajis, pomegranate and pumpkin seeds) and it's delicious each and every time. 

It can get packed on a weekend evening but you can usually get a seat within a short wait. 

Really sweet staff and good selection of drinks!"}
{"text":"On vacation with friends stopped in here for drinks and snacks. The service was good. Pub/hunting decor with a fun, welcoming energy. They have an extensive whiskey list and a number of interesting cocktails. We ordered the crab dip, which was so-so and the haloumi, which was so good we got a second order."}
{"text":"Solid brunch menu. Had the full English and it was gigantic. Couldn't finish it. Fresh orange juice, decent coffee, friendly staff."}
{"text":"Cozy, cool gastropub in a small neighborhood. Sat on the patio, had the kale salad and steak- both prepared to perfection! Would def return! Loved the down to Earth staff and great service! Morgan, our waitress was on it- while Mark, her assistant gave us great travel advice and suggested a dessert: the half-baked cookie with van ice cream! THE BEST!"}
{"text":"Went there on a friday night for a drink to celebrate a birthday. We were four people and we had made a reservation earlier on the same day. I actually liked this place, i did not expect it to be good. 

We decided to give their food a try so we all ordered different things. I am not so sure what are the names of the plates we ordered but we really enjoyed them. I was very surprised about my plate ( it had brussel sprouts in it) because it was so delicious!!

The ambiance is nice, it was packed so it was extremely loud. We couldn't hear each other so we had to scream lol. Also, the tables are reallllly close to each other so it's a little tight!

Anyways, this place was great. It's good for groups or to grab a drink with friends. You really should try their food too, the prices are surprisingly cheap!"}
{"text":"Yummy burgers, attentive service--I'd go back for sure! There's space to sit outdoors, which is nice, music was 80s that night and maybe a bit painful at times but that's okay. I have to go back for another burger because I was already stuffed that night and could tell it was delicious but could not properly appreciate it! Oh, and we didn't have to order at the counter, yay!"}
{"text":"A cozy ambience, an ok selection of beers and an effort to offer a legitimate Irish (or somewhere around there) experience. 

It is certainly popular for a 5-7 (lucky for those who can be there at 5) and the popularity seems deserved."}
{"text":"Nice little pub with a healthy selection of gin. They even have a tasting menu of 3 gins a glass of beer! Nice and cozy; good for conversations.

Price is above average."}
{"text":"Not going to change my stars, but I had a veggie burger here that's worth talkin' 'bout.

Sparrow was too full, so we moseyed over here, just 3 pregnant ladies near-hangry after Yoga. We were able to grab a spot on the patio - out of reach of the adorable but mega loud Elton John marathon that seemed to be happening within. Ok!

We were treated to prompt and friendly service- almost too friendly but not quite. 

The veggie burger has no protein which is a bummer, but if you're going to do the so-ubiquitous-it's-boring portobello burger you should do it like this. Delicious perfect brioche bun (so puffy!) Super juicy smokey mushroom, slightly spicy and saucy. Straight up. With a pickle and a side of the world's most perfect garlic potatoes. Crunchy and gooey with bright flavours of lightly pickled (I think) red onions. So good. Perfect yoga food ;)"}
{"text":"Stopped for an appetizer and again this spot did not disappoint. The bartender Sean Michael was attentive and informative on their Gin selection. Over 160 different Gins! So I had a beer!! Lol
Had their salad and Buffalo cheese app... both good choices. Good music, unassuming place well done.
I'll be back to try their cocktails."}
{"text":"Environment cozy & comfortable 
Food & Service are great 
All menu starting at C$5.95
Portion is great too!
There are 4 of us and we enjoy variety choices with our tight budget!"}
{"text":"My friends and I really enjoyed is Mille End Plateau watering hole. It's the type of place that is reminiscent of my youth in my 18-25 year old days of spending lots of time and money meeting friends for pints on the weekends. Tables surrounded the place and they were not jammed in like other places. The music they played was really good. Some vintage some funky and the atmosphere was really relaxed. A very solid beverage offering plus a kitchen serving food what else could you seriously ask for in a neighbourhood pub. Place wasn't totally packed but enough to provide the feel that you weren't drinking alone. No one likes to hang out in an empty pub. Something about feeling like you want to be where the action is at on a Friday or Saturday night. 

One downside was that there are not two single washrooms. This could pose problem if is place is busy. 

Service was adequate. It was semi busy so our server was running between tables. Nothing unbearable and we tipped her with each drink so she would keep coming back. 

B&B is a good place if more relaxed meet ups with friends are your game-plan. Not sure if this is a pickup bar as people seem to come in groups. If this is your conquest best of luck. We shall be back for drinks in the future."}
{"text":"TLDR: Great cocktails.

While I'm a bigger fan of its sister, Burgundy Lion, Pub Bishop & Bagg is also a great pub to frequent. I opted for one of their seasonal cocktails which was composed of whisky, warm apple cider, caramel syrup, and spices. It warmed me right up as did the pub's friendly atmosphere.Overall it was a fine experience.  I think I will have to visit again for their tempting food menu."}
{"text":"I had a couple of their delicious house ale beer served by one of my favorite bartenders in Montreal , the sweet and lovely Sabrina and thought my evening couldn't get any better. Then I had their awesome Cheesus Christ burger and discovered I was wrong . One of the most awesome burgers I've ever had"}
{"text":"I am not a pub fan. I actually hate pubs but decided to tag along with friends and grab a bit here. 

OMG!! So happy I did. I had the lamb kebabs with a couple of Lucky Gingers on the side. DELISH. The ambiance is amazing. The food was amazing. Nice chill place. 

Definitely suggest you check it out!"}
{"text":"Sunday morning... Excellent brunch...the service is perfect..large variety of brunch..a nice place to go if you are around!!!"}
{"text":"Great Plateau pub, great food, friendly environment. I have had breakfast and dinner here and it is better than most pub food in the city. I like the vibe, especially on Saint Viateur"}
{"text":"Ok, Wednesday night not a packed night but nobody came to see us for at least 10 minutes in...Not even water? 
We got up & left and we're sitting at Mile End grillade and they're taking our order in less than 2minutes!
Sorry, but I'm maybe not chill enough for this place!
I may give it another chance some day, but for a new place it sucked that that happened!"}
{"text":"This place is a little dark and a little loud, but the beer is great and the food is pretty good too. 

I've seen people calling it a British pub and I have to say, being from Britain and all, that it really isn't. At least, not in terms of food - pub fare in the UK tends to be a lot more straightforward, whereas here everything is quite fancy (and a little pricey too).

I think Bishop & Bagg makes a better terrace pub in the summer than a food pub in the winter!"}
{"text":"You'll be paying a bit more than the MTL average for a pint and a snack, however the quality and service here has always been really good. Excellent cozy pub vibes & Sunday night trivia here is the best!"}
{"text":"I stopped off here with a small group on a hockey night and man this place was packed.  Even though the bar was full it still didn't take long to get drinks and food.  As English style pubs go this one is A - OK, the beer choices were good and the menu had something that satisfied everyone in the group."}
{"text":"I love a good pub so when I heard so many positive things about Bishop and Bagg I couldn't wait to try it out.  It is owned by the same people who run the Burgundy Lion so you expect it to be a quality pub given how good their other spot is.  Even though it is fairly new it's already become a popular spot and once you have their food and drink you'll see why.

They have a small cocktail list, good selection of beers on tap and a vast selection of scotches to taste.  The cocktails are slightly on the expensive side for Montreal standards however they are strong so you do get your money's worth.  I wasn't a fan of the Pimm's Cup which was a little on the weak side but that was the one exception.  The Sidecar and Planter's Punch were both amazing and on the strong side.  My friends who got the Bloody Caesar did say it was one of the better ones that they've had and that it was super spicy which is the way they liked it.

Foodwise they have a smallish menu but they are one of those places that like to focus on doing a few items well as opposed to being too diversified.  Don't expect food like burgers and wings.  They take pub food up a notch.  I ordered jerked cornish hen with plantain mash.  Cornish hen can be very dry if not cooked properly but they got it just right and weren't scared to play with spice either.

Take note that to order food and drink here they do it in the style of a proper English pub which means you go up to the bar to place your order which will then be brought to you.  They don't take reservations so if you're going to be a group show up early.  This place gets packed very quickly especially on weekends.  Once you try it out though you'll understand why it's so popular.  I'm definitely adding this pub to my list of preferred pubs and bars in Montreal."}
{"text":"What compelled me to write a review for Bishop and Bagg is their brunch. Not to say that their drinks aren't worth writing about; it's just that I know practically zilch about beers and cocktails. The first couple of times I was there, it was just for the company and I didn't particularly enjoy myself because the place was packed (I hate crowds) and people were smoking in the patio (my problem, not theirs). The third time I went there, a Saturday afternoon, it was a lot quieter, there were just 4 or 5 tables of folks watching the hockey and soccer games, and as I was hungry, I went for their brunch \"The Yank\", which consisted of a choice of bacon (or sausages or ham), two eggs, potatoes and toast. Pretty standard sounding, right? Wrong! First of all, there's none of the usual pathetic quarter of a tomato or slither of fruit cocktail garniture on the plate. Second of all, there's something truly special about the potatoes. It was this big cube of mashed potato in a crispy coating that almost resembles a rosti. So good. As for the bacon, it was thick and crispy at the same time. So satisfying. No kidding,  it was probably one of the best traditional (with a twist) brunch meals I have ever had."}
{"text":"Went there for brunch. The food was excellent. The menu is original and diverse. We were not the easiest customers as we had a baby with us, we asked to switch tables and we were slow at ordering, and the staff was super nice and accommodating. The best part was that there was no line up on a Sunday at 11!"}
{"text":"Really good variety of scotch and whisky, the food is good and of good quality. The decor is really nice and offers a really good feeling the whole time you  spend there."}
{"text":"A very cool English style pub. The music is a bit load (for an English pub) but you have an nice selections of beers (and styles) for 8-9$ a pint interesting cocktails for 10-13$ and the food also looks nice.
The place looks perfect whether you are solo or if you are in a group. I liked the overall atmosphere and service, it was a bit expensive but will go into my \"cool place in the neighborhood\" list"}
{"text":"Une belle aventure pour un service de brunch au sein d'un pub. Des plats qui sortent des assiettes de brunch ordinaires à des prix très abordables."}
{"text":"Great location and a really nice addition to the neighbourhood. Lots of beers on tap, the place is quite cozy, has a cool menu, nice staff and a non-pretentious vibe. I can see becoming a regular here."}
{"text":"The staff is super super super friendly. You order everything at the bar, which turns out to be much less of a hassle than it might sound. Speaking of sound, when you're here at peak time, it is extremely loud. Lots of gin and whiskey to choose from. The menu is definitely several notches above similar \"pubs:\" the lamb skewer is an excellent deal, the salad with pickled beets and the smoked trout appetizer are delicious. Skip the puddings, though."}
{"text":"**With apologies to Risa D., as I ended up going anyway after a friend wanted to check it out :p Still up for round 2 though!**

The Burgundy Lion guys opened a new pub even closer to my apartment. That's pretty much all I needed to hear in order to run over and check out Bishop and Bagg. Located in Mile End on the corner of Clark and St-Viateur where an Italian café used to be, this English pub is right along my regular spring/summer bike path to and from the Market, so this could get very hairy for me as the warm weather rolls around. I was very excited to see in what ways this spot would differ from the Lion which continues to be my favourite pub in town.

Bishop and Bagg is a smaller, more intimate place when compared to the Burgundy Lion. Part of that is the smaller floor space so less people in the pub but also the overall vibe - there are no TVs and the music is more ambient compared to the Lion's higher decibel count (which is the one thing that is starting to bother me about the Lion - now scratched off the possible date spot list as conversation is basically impossible). The use of dark burgundy colours, old framed pictures and the old school wood bar really give it an authentic British pub look - perhaps even more than the Lion itself.

The other interesting aspect of Bishop and Bagg is how they seek to mimic a true pub experience through the service - there are no waiters per se. Everything is done at the bar - you order all food and drinks through the barman via your table number and it is sent to you as ready. Each \"round\" is added to a table tab and then you divide up the damage later on. Definitely a different take for a pub and one that I am curious to see how well it works on busier nights (I will have to do my research...). Either way, it creates a more relaxed vibe that is enjoyable.

The drink menu will be familiar to anyone who frequents the Burgundy Lion - same varieties of beer with a few different cocktails showcased here. Pleasant surprise when I walked in - my favourite bartender from the Lion has made the move over it would appear, so I knew the cocktails would be on point. My multiple Boulevardiers (Bourbon, Campari and Sweet Vermouth) proved I wasn't mistaken.

As for the food, it is certainly not what one would call classic pub cuisine but Bishop and Bagg doesn't aim for that anyway. Their website states that this is a \"pub with great food\", one that isn't traditionally British but what they call country pub inspired. All right then. First, we grabbed some small snacks - hickory styx and some spiced nuts with rosemary. Nice snacking options to go with some drinks - I was particularly enjoying the spiced nuts which had the right hint of rosemary on top of the other spices going on. The hickory styx were a nice alternative to basic chips.

As main dishes, we tried two different ones. First up, lamb kebabs served on pitas with some tzatziki sauce, lettuce and vegetables. Nice favours across the board here - the lamb was cooked properly, the sauce added nice creaminess without overpowering the rest of the dish and the vegetables were nice &amp; fresh.  

The second dish was porchetta with grilled escarole and white beans. Loved this dish - the fattiness of the porchetta, one of my favourite meat preparations, paired with the grilled escarole, the white beans, some parsley and a little onion as well. If you had told me this is what I would be eating at a pub, I would have probably laughed at you. This dish would seem much more at home in a different setting but it totally works. Well done all around. 

Loved my initial visit to Bishop and Bagg. Great food, great drinks and an awesome atmosphere - I cannot wait to go back shortly, especially knowing terrasse weather is on its way and as such, that little terrasse will be open as will the garage door windows. I may not go to the Burgundy Lion as often this summer but no worries to the ownership group, I will still be a frequent customer... just elsewhere.

Great food, great drinks and great times, what more can you ask from your local Pub?"}
{"text":"Working In the mile end, this is a super dependable and solid option for lunch. 

Reasonably priced, great burger (to die for home style fries), and gourmet salades and sides allows for everyone to find something they love. Staff are ultra fast, even if the place is packed, you can be in and out within the hour. 

I have also been a few times for Sunday trivia (Anglo). The MC is beyond funny, and we always have a blast."}
{"text":"J'aime cet endroit à l'habitude, mais après avoir réservé pour un groupe de 10 personnes à l'heure du lunch, nous sommes arrivés devant la constatation qu'ils avaient surbooké, nous laissant ainsi le luxe de trouver un autre restaurant au froid glacial. Merci à Un Autre Restaurant d'avoir sauvé les meubles :)"}
