{"text":"Amazing hidden gem. They're on the second floor now, access by the stairs.   Favs: Ma La Tang (spicy soup) Lamb noodles  Tea eggs (1.25 each, incl taxes)  There's always a deposit of $2 for the bowl, so bring it back n get ur refund."}
{"text":"It is the type of Chinese restaurant you dream of finding, a small and obscure place no one has ever heard of, tucked away from public view in a decrepit building. The menu, printed mostly in Chinese on simple white sheets of paper taped to the front of the counter, included very little information about the dishes themselves. \"Ragout - os de porc et légumes\" gives you an idea of the template. I ordered number #28 only to switch it to #2 after a man ahead of me picked up a plate that I knew I had to try. #2, a pork neck soup with noodles and vegetable, was perhaps the best soup I ever had. Before it was handed to me I was asked if I wanted garlic juice poured over what must have been over a 1 pound of pork neck meat bulging out of the bowl. Yes, please. Fresh coriander? Yes. Hot pepper oil? Hell yes. The pig's neck meat, massive chunks attached to bones and joints, was so good that I do not have the vocabulary to properly describe it. Included was the succulent bone marrow, a perfectly edible part of an animal many restaurants regrettably shy away from serving. The juices from the marrow mixed with a broth already loaded with flavour. The noodles, soaked in this, went down smooth and hit the spot in ways I did not think possible. While I sat there savoring my soup for almost an hour, there was a constant flow of customers all addressing the cashier in what must have been Chinese, ordering dishes that I know I will soon come back to try. Once I finished my meal I downloaded the Yelp app solely to write this review. Sitting there in the food court, basting in that warm and full feeling of satisfaction that comes only after downing a large noodle soup, I thought for a moment that I should perhaps refrain from writing a review. I feared that the more people know about Fondue Chinoise Express, the less I will feel like I am in the know of a great Montreal food secret, but these people deserve your money. 5 stars."}
{"text":"Best word to describe this little gem: home. The food, the service, the price, even the setting of the food court, all remind me of good old mainland China, in more than a good way. The quantity of food for the price is insane. I usually spend about 8$ and never leave there hungry, even though I came starving. I usually always take the fondue, but I've also tried some other dishes like the big plate chicken, which was very flavourful as I like it. The fondue is fantastic. All the ingredients are between 0.8$ to 1.2$ each, expect some kinds of fish. The flavours are just right and you can adjust the spiciness and numbness as you like. Goes very well with the soy milk that they also have. Be prepared to pay a deposit for the bowl. Bring cash if you can! No credit cards."}
{"text":"Been there twice, had a pork belly & rice noodles soup pot the first time, and eggplant & rice the second time. Both times are super good and authentic!!!  *tip: there's a deposit for the pot that will be returned."}
{"text":"love the place. I have been there for millions of time. It is very convenient to the students around.  They offer express fondue which is a mix of veggie and noodles boiled in a savory soup. They also offer all kinds of noodle dishes such as sweet potato starch noodle, rice noodle and regular noodle with beef, pork and lamb. The number of choices is huge. The hot pot dish is also a good one, a little similar to the express fondue but with more signature combination and comes with rice.   I recommend lamb rice noodle if you like lamb."}
{"text":"Four stars for the rice noodle, taste alright and large portions, two or three stars for the fondue because it's nearly flavorless and the ingredients are not fresh at all"}
{"text":"reasonable price huge portion decent Chinese street food  recommend:  lamb rice noodles with sauerkraut fish fragrant eggplant with rice"}
{"text":"This hidden place at Green House is great.  They have variety of dishes and they give a lot. Almost it's not expensive at all. For 15$ you can refill your belly to max. It's a kind of Chinese fast food, but you won't regret to visit."}
{"text":"Difficile de pouvoir manger autant pour aussi peu cher ! Avec un sacré choix ! Pour 8.65 $ taxes incluses, votre ventre sera bien calés avec de la bouffe plus santé que votre sandwich habituel."}
{"text":"what a hidden gem, if you want home cooked authentic chinese food, come here. no pretention. just good. food. the chef has a great sense of humor too."}
{"text":"Absolutely delishhh!!  Hidden in the food court of the Faubourg, there's this restaurant that serves 'Ma la tang' -- a street version of hotpot that originated in Sichuan -- beats any hotpot whatsoever I've tasted in Canada.  When ordering, you fill up a list of food you want in your 'ma la tang'. For example, I had glass noodles, fresh noodles, shrimp balls, potato, pork, fish, fresh tofu, fried tofu, and more.  The complete list encompasses a lot of exciting items for which I would definitely come back for.  One thing though, despite my fake Sichuan training (ex-gf forced me to eat spicy), I didn't want to (and probably couldn't) handle that heat. I took out half the  sichuan chili/peppercorn paste -- so ask for half the spiciness unless you wanna sacrifice two thirds of your taste buds.  And now, the broth is what makes this place a solid 5/5. It was flawless: epic flavours that came together and complemented each other very well.   And for all this deliciousness, it came to about 10$ after tax... Ridiculously cheap and filled me up for a good 18h.  I think I'm heading back there after wrapping up this review...which is about now."}
{"text":"Located in what is essentially a deserted shopping center, Fondue Chinoise Express is indeed a hidden gem. Ordering will be a bit difficult if you can't read Chinese but the couple who work there are very kind and helpful. The $2 deposit for your bowl and spoon is also kind of weird but I understand why they do it. My friend ordered the lunch special, which was a beef noodle soup ($6.5) that she enjoyed immensely, despite the fact that she can't handle spice. It had a variety of ingredients in it - bok choy, broccoli, bamboo tofu, and more. I had the ma la tang. To order, you fill out a paper slip either in mandarin (simplified) or Franglais, and choose what you want. Mine totaled 14.40 which I found to be a bit steep at first, considering the atmosphere. After it came out, however, I realized I definitely ordered wayyyy too much. It was so tasty that I finished the whole bowl but I had to push the cross the finish line, and I am typing this while 30 seconds away from a food coma. Also, I was excited to try their dong bei la pi but apparently they only make it in the summer, so I guess I'll have to make another visit then!"}
{"text":"I dont speak any chinese, but the food is DELICIOUS. Best noodle soup ever! I normally take the agneau soup avec trippes and the spicy chilis they add at the end. Eat here, you wont regret."}
