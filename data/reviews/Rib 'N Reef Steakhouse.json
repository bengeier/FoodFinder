{"text":"Now I am not going to tell you about how great their steak was in this great steakhouse which was served with complimentary cole slaw and pickles because that's a given I am going to talk about their fish which was incredibly fresh and cooked perfectly with a drizzling of the finest Greek olive oil which BTW was also used to make us a Caesar salad table side from scratch that warrants a visit to this restaurant alone. We were so impressed with the Bass which was large enough to share and so flaky and juicy that the Rib 'n Reef has now become our go to restaurant when we are looking for a place that satisfies all our friends diversified palates. Service is first class under the direction of Mr.Hamad and they have a wonderful Cigar Lounge upstairs where we had our digestifs and a Cuban cigar. Try it for he fish you will be quite impressed I know we were !!!"}
{"text":"From the minute I walked in, to minute I got into my car, what I experienced was definitely not something I expect when I go out to restaurant, let alone a restaurant that is supposed to be one the top steak houses in Montreal.

1. When we first walked in, I spoke English with the service staff. When she brought us the menus they were in French. This was not a big deal, and is a detail I can easily forgive. However it was precursor to the rest of the night.

2. When my Junior Cut Rib Steak arrived, the plate had blood all around the contour. How a steak house as renowned as Rib N Reef can let a plate go out without resting the meat is beyond me. I was in a rush and did not want to wait for another piece of meat, so I simply ate what was brought to me. When I go out for a steak, I expect it to cooked properly and rested. Even a 10$ steak at Chenoy's would never be served the way mine was. This was unacceptable and it was at this point that I told myself I would not be coming back to this establishment. 

3. When our check had arrived, I noticed that the server had charged me for a Filet and Shrimps, 2 separate items. When in fact my wife ordered the combination of shrimps/mignonette. The way that the waiter charged us ended up with the bill costing 6$ more than it should have. The money is not the point, the principal is. Looking at the bill, the price difference was not going to change the amount of money I left as I had no plans on asking for change. I decided that instead of giving the waiter a bigger tip, ill simply leave the bill as is and just walk out angry. Again, this reinforced my earlier decision that I would not be coming back to rib n reef.

4. The icing in the cake was when I got my car back from the Valet. When I got in my car I notice that my seat has been moved. This is the first time a valet has ever moved my seat. I asked him if he moved my seat, as i wanted confirmation and he said YES!! 

Finally, I sent an email to the address they have on their website, describing how bad my experience was. I even attached a picture of my plate (covered in blood). I was not looking for any compensation, as I really don't plan on going back. I simply wanted acknowledgement. It's been 5 days since I sent my email and have still not received a response.

Horrible service, in and outside the restaurant."}
{"text":"My sesame tuna was yummy. My dates bone in steak was nice & tender as well. The service was awesome, the wait staff checked up on our table every chance they could. I wanted oysters as appetizers but unfortunately the kitchen ran out, it was only 5:30pm too but what can you do right. Originally i wanted the halibut fish but they ran out of that too so i ended up choosing tuna. Glad my meal was enjoyable. Theres also valet service with kind valet tenants as well."}
{"text":"C'est vraiment exceptionnellement bon! C'est pas donné mais ça vaut le coup! Notre serveur (Dan) était tellement gentil... Demandez pour lui quand vous irez. 
Et il y a un valet pour le stationnement."}
{"text":"Great steak house! Always on top! Service is superb! Great food is expected! However, this place is missing the creativity touch, the food is very very traditional- there are no surprises in taste or presentation, hence the 4 stars. Great for celebrations! Has a new York feel to it"}
{"text":"i did not like the service. they served me a big steak with no sides. when i asked for sides options they told me they didn't have anything left because they had a big day. wth?! so after the manager came they ended up finding a big ugly potatoe somewhere and gave it to me. i didn't even bother trying it. then i asked for a specific wine and they told me they didn't have it. so much money paid for such a bad service. i was very disappointed"}
{"text":"Love it. Love it. Love it. My steak is dead on every single time. Staff are friendly."}
{"text":"I just came back from the Rib n Reef in Montreal with a number of friends who go to this restaurant fairly often.  This was my first time.  I was very disappointed.  However speaking to my friends, they told me that my issues with this place, although well founded, are not typical of the restaurant.

For a steakhouse charging the kind of money they do must do a better job with their service.  My friends ordered a Cesar salad that is prepared at the table.  Well, if prepared at the table, I would expect that the person preparing the salad concentrate on preparing the dish and not multi task with the rest of the staff and instruct others on administrative matters.  

The same thing happened when my friends ordered 2 Brazilian coffees.  The person preparing the coffees was busy with collecting cash from other tables, having some of the wait staff place glasses at a different table, and then stop the \"show\" and serve the others at our table our regular coffee.  They should pay attention to what they are doing and make the experience a nice one.

At the end, there was a few mix ups with the bills and it just created to the overall disappointment with the service.

Finally, one last comment, my roast beef was luke warm when it was served to me."}
{"text":"Horrible snobby service. Took forever. Just wanted a drink with a coworker on a great looking terrace while visiting Canada. Decided not to eat there even after we read reviews of other experiences."}
{"text":"I typically make a point of trying new restaurants when I visit clients on their own turf. I always wanted to try R&R but I'm really not around decarie for more than the time it takes to whiz by on the expressway. So I jumped on the opportunity to get a lunch reservation at RR when I had the chance. You will experience service from: the valet, coat check, hostess, maitre d', waiter and manager. A lot of potential areas to screw-up! In this case, I give them 5 stars, because everyone that gave me service that day was very helpful and polite. If you arrive at lunch and you don't see valet, go ahead and park. They will be around to collect your key or if not, give it to the hostess and she will take care of it. Now for the meal... it was fantastic! I arrvied in advance to make campagne arrangements with the MD and it was carried out flawlessly. Yes, bubbly for lunch! The menu is pretty straight forward, with everything you would expect from fresh steak to seafood- the waiter will also tell you what just arrived and is off menu. I didn't notice a lunch menu with lighter portions which was lame. I ordered the mignette steak which is a 6oz filet mignon. My collegue ordered the regualr filet mignon and was sorry he did when he saw the size of a 10oz portion. Awww... when will people learn portion sizes. Anyway, I recommend the mignette (for normal human beings), which comes with a boat load of tasty potato wedges (or your choice of baked potato, etc). Plus if you include all the fixings on the table, such as: pickles, bread sticks, coleslaw, bread buns, etc., it is quite the feast. But I have to emphasize again, that this resto is stuck in pre-obesity awareness times! For the love of god, not all your customers are 300lbs and want to spend 100$/person for half a cow. So, since I was the only one at the table who had room for dessert- I chose the homemade choclate cake, which was absolutely devine. It was perfectly moist with varied textures that made it an excellent finish. As for decor, the layout is nice (tip: the washrooms are downstairs), but the dining room could use some serious updating- it is a little too 90's \"Ruth Chris\" steakhous\"ish\" with aging ceilings, etc, as is the menu... in the sense of pricing and portions. Conclusion, my experience was 5 star for that lunch service, but my overall rating is 4 star, because of the deficiencies mentioned above, which might have you clutching your wallet. Gotta have a lunch menu, guys!"}
{"text":"I stop in on New Years Eve. The food was ok. We like the ambience and it was a good night.
We spend $240 with tip. I was way too expensive for me."}
{"text":"All good although the prices are rather high for certain items. On a Saturday night you can't hear yourself think as the younger crowd takes over with all of their enthusiasm. 

The cigar lounge is excellent and a welcome addition to a city that has lost its culture and class. 

Kudos to this establishment. The two other renown steak houses should take note as a lot of their old regular clients are now departing to a steak house that is consistent and appreciates its customers ."}
{"text":"A great steakhouse with an elegant setting! 
The service was amazing and the food was superb. 
I ordered a mignonette and it was cooked just the way I asked. Sides and salads were just right. A great experience from beginning to end! :)"}
{"text":"There is nothing trendy and pretentious about the Rib 'n Reef.  It is just good and that's it!  Having the Caesar Salad prepared at your table was nothing special, in all honesty, I'd rather the cook do the cooking and the server do the serving, but the taste was amazing.  It is really good, really strong (garlic and flavourful), but really good!  I had the juniour cut of Prime Rib cooked medium rare.  It was perfectly cooked, but I should order medium, as it just is never hot enough for my liking,  Still, it was a gorgeous cut of meat.  It was served with green peas, which did nothing, but looked right.  The beef was tender and I truly enjoyed every bite!  I also had a side of garlic mashed potatoes.  They were not warm enough and not all that special.  

I look forward to visiting again!"}
{"text":"Came here during a conference. The place is fancy and nicely decorated. The staff was friendly and showed us the way to the conference room. 

I took the salmon tartare as an appetizer, the steak as the main and a chocolate cake as dessert. The portions are huge and it's hard to eat everything. However, they all had a great taste, especially the tartare."}
{"text":"RIb n reef !!!!! The best restaurant I've ever been to in my life and God knows I'm a foodie. The service: A1 firion gave us everything we needed smiling the whole time took care of us like royalty gave us a tour of the wine wind cellar and told s everything we needed to know about each bottle that was in that wine cellar and Louise which I thought was the manager cause she took care of us so well and gave us more than what we needed it was amazing. The food is amazing the prices a reasonable and the ambiance is intimate but so fun at the same time if I could use one word to describe this place : IMPPECABLE"}
{"text":"As I work my way around the different steak houses in montreal, the first time I went the steak was good as was the Cesar salad. The second time, however, was charred and not very good. With the different steak house options out there, I'd suggest against going to this one."}
{"text":"We were here for Valentines Day, and the restaurant was packed.  The service was amazing from the minute we walked in as we were treated like royalty.  It was a cold day and they even asked to get my car early to warm it up before.  I would defiantly come back soon."}
{"text":"For steak lovers, this is a good place to go to!! 

The service is sometimes slow but hey, it's not their fault! We Miss Pedro & Johnny...that's why we don't visit as often anymore since they aren't working anymore. 

In the summer, their roof top terrace is amazing! 

The food and wine is good, but sometimes the steak can be overcooked. No problem, just send it back. Their mini burgers, mac and cheese and calamari are my favourites! 

They have an extensive wine list and have a wine for everyone! 

Cheers to Peter and his team!"}
{"text":"Very fine dining. Pricey. Exceptional service. Prime rib was really gòod. Definitely will come back."}
{"text":"Easily my favourite steakhouse in Montreal.
Service is always excellent, from the valet parking all the way up.... the wine cellar  downstairs is tremendous, the food is what you'll compare all other top notch steakhouses to and I'm still dreaming about the tableside tuna tartare.
Yes, it's expensive, but you won't regret it after you experience an evening there."}
{"text":"In my opinion the best steakhouse in Montreal. Been to all of them multiple times, this is the most consistent one. Good food, great wine list and amazing service. Also, having the cigar lounge upstairs to go have a few drinks after, just adds to the experience."}
{"text":"I learned about Rib 'n Reef on an AA flight home, their magazine featured Montreal on the cover and this restaurant was mentioned. They included a picture of the wine cellar and I fell in love. I had to go. I saved the magazine as a reminder. Finally, about a year and a half later, I had the opportunity to visit Montreal and consequently, Rib 'n Reef. I love steakhouses, but I was mostly there for the wine. Our waiter sent the wine connoisseur to our table and with our preference of wine and our tastebuds (I like it dry and not too buttery, my friend doesn't like it too dry), he found the perfect Chardonnay for us. He said, \"if you don't like this, it's on the house.\" We obviously loved it. Now I'm on a hunt for that Sonoma County Chardonnay in NY and I can't find it anywhere! I was a little disappointed with the decor. I mean, it's a steakhouse, so there's only so much they can do, but I felt crowded by the tables next to us. Unfortunately, I stuffed myself that afternoon at lunch, and I had an incredible craving for crab cakes, so I did not do a steak, because I knew it wouldn't fit anywhere. My friend is allergic to everything so her steak was literally just a steak so there wasn't much flavor there, so I can't give a fair feedback on their steaks. The crab cake was excellent, the service was excellent, and their connoisseur was excellent. Highly recommend! I'll definitely come back with a bigger appetite in the future."}
{"text":"Last Saturday was my second visit to Rib 'N Reef, both times for our wedding anniversary.

I must say that the some 15 years in between our visits gave ample time to jack up their prices! Even with a $100 gift card, we had to disburse over $200 for the meal. Hubby took one beer, and that was all the extant of our alcohol consumption for the evening!

But... the food was good (probably not $300 good). I had the crab cakes (which comes with a mustard sauce which I did not care for at all) and were really good; mostly crab, not filling! Hubby had the tuna tartar, which is made at the table and was amazing.

The lobster tail that came with my steak was cooked perfectly, tender and savory. My steak was good, but, I think hubby can make it if not better, as good as them on the bbq! I like my steak rare, and its a very difficult thing to get in a restaurant; seems like Rib 'N Reef included. It was quite tasty and very tender though.

Hubby really enjoyed his NY Strip and garlic mashed potatoes.

Finally, I have to admit that their crème brulée is as good as mine... damn it! ;)

What really impressed me there though, was the quality of the service. Those guys know their business and are an integral part of what makes a meal at the Rib 'N Reef so special! Thank you very much to the very nice and professional waiters!"}
{"text":"We dined at Rib & Reef last night. The restaurant's decor is elegant and the free valet parking is wonderful. The service is attentive and professional as befitting a restaurant of this calibre. The issue is with the foods itself. The junior rib was well cooked and seasoned but it just didn't deliver the  \"mouth-water factor\" of Moishe's or Gibby's. My colleague's filet mignon was the same. I had a Monte Carlo potato as a side and I found that it was overly large and sloppy, with cheese overflowing on top. The potato was delivered to our table cold and when I returned it to be heated up, it was returned about 2 minutes later, only mildly warmer. This is an expensive restaurant and so, frankly, for that kind of money the meal should \"wow\" and not be simply mediocre. I'd recommend Moishe's or Gibby's over Rib & Reef any day."}
{"text":"Fancy! Honestly dress up or down its a very nice place and atmosphere. They have made at your table caesar salad and crepes suzette! Food itself it only above average, though. Service is great except that we waited literally 20 minutes to get the cheque at the end..... also it gets loud and is rather difficult to navigate due to all the carts making food around the tables! Solid drinks though, and a delightfully spicy bloody mary."}
{"text":"The food is very good and love that it has a cigar lounge behind a 'star-trek' like door.  

I take clients and my sales reps there for celebratory dinners and the experience is solid 4 stars for an upscale surf 'n turf."}
{"text":"This my second time and let me tell you from the moment you're welcomed with the valet to the last service, everything is exceptional! I love the fact they give you a break between courses. The caesar salad is made in front of you and its reaaally good salad, not your typical caesar salad.  The filet mignon with blue cheese was perfect so was the classic roast beef. Hands downs best steak i've ever ever had, The table d'hôte is affordable. The ambiance is so nice and chic. Super worth it and highly recommended."}
{"text":"Completely over rated rubbery over priced steaks cooked using a blow torch. When charging $74 for a steak, the least you expect is to have it prepared to your doneness. Wrong. The superb service doesn't make up for how awfully the bone in steaks are here. Once you fight yourself through the harassing valet parking agents you are faced with a pleasant dining experience. Did I mention $19 per shrimp, really? Skip it if you don't have a generous expense account or aren't a millionaire."}
{"text":"Um, I'm going to go with glorious, though definitely surprising off the highway up there by Decarie. Seriously though, go there for friendly dignified service from attentive men in suits who make the tartare and salads table side; dish up baked potato fixings from silver serving dishes; compliment your wine choices; hand you hot towels when your done; make you feel welcome ever if you are wearing a baseball cap or making inappropriate jokes. (Which I never do. Honest.)

More importantly; delicious. Perfect lobster tail - I only risk ordering this when I think there's a very high probability it will be perfect and it was, oh yes it was. Most of the manly men at our table ordered the roast beef and appeared gleeful at the size and flavour of the great beast that came. I didn't taste it though, too busy cracking tail and high fiving my new pickle friends. Did I mention the bowls of big fat pickles on the table? Because that's gets you close to 5 stars right there in my book. 

Great time with wonderful people, will gladly return. Thanks to the wise Yelpers who introduced me to Rib 'N Reef!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best steakhouse in the city. The rib steak is spectacular! They make the ceasar salad right in front of you and you can change it to your tastes so its always the best you've had because you helped make it. Staff and managers are very helpful and service is amazing. If you're a cigar aficionado you can go upstairs to the private cigar lounge stocked with great cigars."}
{"text":"Dès l'arrivée, un valet nous attends. Nous étions un groupe de 20 qui a été accueilli dans le cellier au sous-sol, donc souper intime avec nos propres serveurs. La forme de la table nous permettait de voir tous les convives (pas l'habituelle table longue à l'infini qui ne permet aucune échange à l'exception des voisins immédiats). Le serveur nous a proposé des entrées à partager. Il est donc venu avec 3 plateaux garnis d'huitres, crevettes géantes, pieuvres, calmars, légumes grillés. Après l'entrée et le pain, j'étais déjà pleine. Il nous présente le menu et recommande bien sûr le steak. Selon son discours, il vient accompagner de légume et leur fameuse purée de pomme de terre.... Et voici ce qui élimine une étoile. Déception totale, pas de légumes grillés et la purée... la purée.... De simple pommes de terre en purée rien d'autre, pas de fines herbes, pas de crème, pas de beure, rien. Pas de goût. Pourtant c'est si simple de faire un purée crémeuse, onctueuse et gouteuse. 
La cuisson de la viande est parfaite et selon notre demande.
Le service est impecable.
Les desserts supers.
La facture salée. Si vous ne voyez pas la différence entre un t-bone et un rib steak, qu'il soit veilli ou qu'il vienne du marché à bas prix, çà ne vaut peut-être pas le prix, mais pour les amateurs et les événements spéciaux, pourquoi pas.
Je l'ai essayé une fois, çà me va.
Une meilleure purée et j'aurais mis 5."}
{"text":"I loved the shrimp it was so amazing that I can't describe it ! The steak was okay nothing that wow to me !! u can get it elsewhere for a better price ! The service was perfect nothing to complain about ! Overall I will go back to it  specially for the shrimps"}
{"text":"Although the restaurant is expensive, you get what you pay for. Amazing service and fantastic steak !!! Very happy with this place, just need to save up before I go again lol"}
{"text":"From start to finish everything was incredible. From the service to the atmosphere to the incredible tasting meal.  Always love coming, never ever leave disappointed. 
Caesar salad which is prepared in front of you is fantastic. No other restaurant can compare.  Had the tuna (made to perfection and melt in your mouth)"}
{"text":"Rib n' reef is very upscale. You really need to dress properly and come here with a healthy wallet lol!
The atmosphere is super upscale with big spenders all around the parking lot lol.
When you come here make sure you're wallet is full.. to come here be ready to spend over 300$ for you and another person.
We were here for a lovely dinner meal of 4 people. We ordered a hot seafood platter as a starter with a fancy new Zealand wine. It was very delicious.

The food was superbe. Cooked to perfection. 
We had the waiter bring out the meats that were raw and have us pick out our cut to be cooked. I was really impressed by that. Having to pick out the meat you want is always a bonus.

Service was incredible. Waiters are all dressed elegantly with white collars and black ties. They always came around frequently to refill our drinks and change our utensils. 
Free valet parking is always a major bonus as well

I had an amazing experience and the it was money well spent. I will definitely come back if I'm craving a good cooked steak haha"}
{"text":"Best place to have steak in Montreal, and not only a steak.. their appetizers are BOMB, and ceasar sald that they prepare in front of you is to die for.."}
{"text":"Rib 'N Reef has been around for awhile and caters to a very specific type of clientele. They're well known in my circle of friends as the premiere steakhouse so you'll have to expect to pay the big bucks to enjoy an evening in their establishment.

Driving in, I was provided with a valet and coat service and effectively handed off to the hostess who consequently led us to our seating. The establishment is very elegant and aesthetically pleasing. While this may lead to some thinking this location would be a place you'd take a significant other to for a special evening, for reasons I'll share later I'd recommend this establishment more for a client meeting or an anniversary, albeit, if all parties are able to pay for their meals.

They also have a cigar lounge, great option for those of you who love that type of stuff. I sadly didn't partake.

The menu has a nice variety of options but the one thing that stood out to me is the pricing. It was a little exorbitant even to my budget. How exactly is a 16 oz sirloin steak (New York cut) with no side orders priced at $66? I understand dry-aged USDA prime corn-fed midwestern beef is a quality meat but honestly adding on a much needed side order priced anywhere between $8 to $15 is exaggerated. 

I opted for the onion rings with aïoli sauce ($9).

The sirlon steak was very good but felt they missed the mark with my medium-rare request as it leaned more on rare than I would have liked. The myoglobin oozed out of my steak far too much for my liking, particularly after my steak was resting for some time. Nonetheless, I did enjoy it but what I really enjoyed were the onion rings with aïoli sauce. They were HUGE, with the perfect crispy/saltiness on the outside and chewy flavor on the inside. The aïoli sauce was a nice touch.

The meal was wrapped up with one of our many waiters (or the battalion of men in suits we saw standing around) bringing us some hot towels to wash our faces and hands. So fancy!

We ordered dessert and I went with their creme brulee and cappuccino. The creme brulee was decent but I felt the creme lacked flavor. The cappuccino was good. One of my dining guests had a burnt souffle. They did opt to waive the cost of it when she brought up her concerns. There was an awkward 5 minute wait while we waited on everyone's plate to come. It's important all drinks and desserts are served at the same time. ...

Let's talk about the service and the environment a little. As I mentioned earlier, I feel this location isn't an ideal place you'd take a significant other to for a special evening as it's pretty loud once it gets about half full. Furthermore, anniversaries and client meetings happen and your 1 on 1 dining experience can be somewhat mulled by all that noise. The table beside our had a pair of patrons, sharing a meal between a client and a sales-rep and I literally was able to hear their loud conversation all night long along with all the swear words and childish references to female genitalia and how easy women are in this city. We had many staffers around and I'm sure the ladies at my table would have appreciated if they could have toned down their conversation.

Regarding the staff, they are plenty around but somehow my glass of tap water only got refilled once during the entire evening. Very strategic and easily noticed. Particularly how quickly and efficiently they ensured my glass of wine was never empty. Speaking of the wine, we opted for the Chianti Ruffino and it was delicious. Obviously the chianti had a price-tag and the tap water did not. 

Overall, it was an average experience. The price-tag isn't something I wouldn't say no to on occasion as long as I find value to it, which I felt I didn't. Having a 16 oz steak, a side order of onions shouldn't cost you $80. That's just me though. The service and quality of food didn't feel like a 5 star experience and I felt they missed the mark."}
{"text":"Real Five Star Dining

    Five stars are like VD's on Yelp, they spring up everywhere. Home Depot, Wendy's, everywhere but this restaurant is truly five stars.

    I have eaten here twice, both times were some of my greatest dining experiences to date. The service is beyond reproach, as each waiter tends to a small section and majority of them are on the older side so they've been waiting tables since before you were born.

    And it's the little things that make this place great. They decant your wine before your food arrives so it aerates well. Everything is prepared table side, salad tossed, Creme bruleed, it is quite a sight.

    Then there is the Wine list, it's longer than my...well, it's long. They pride themselves on having one of the most vast and stocked wine cellars in the city.

   The food, like the service, is beyond reproach. My first raw oyster experience occurred here, they were divine. Plump oysters, shucked perfectly, with all appropriate accoutrement and a liqueur that tasted like the Atlantic...ocean, not city.

    They age their beef, so the connective tissue becomes butter, seasoned with a great Montreal steak spice, the decadence is ridonkulous. Then there is the 16oz Prime Rib en Jus, this is the best piece of meat I have ever had, without question. Side with a Monte Carlo potato, some Quebec asperges and washed down with and '03 St. Supery and you'll be texting St. Peter that you're all good to go.

His number is 55G-ATES by the way...we're tight.

{"text":"Steaks good.  Service good. But very expensive. $272 for 2 people including tax & tip including 3 glasses of wine for $45 plus tax & tip. 

Waiter forgot my appetizer, so I didn't have one. Waiter brought wrong steak -- I didn't complain because the person accompanying received theirs at the same time. 

A bit of a disappointment.  Especially considering the price."}
{"text":"Oh my! Que c'est bon! Pour l'estomac... pas pour le porte-feuille. Bon endroit pour une occasion extra spéciale comme un anniversaries important ou bien pour une sortie amoureuse quand on a le besoin d'impressioner!

Les serveurs, bien qu'hyper formels, ont tous un adorable sens de l'humour. Les repas étaient tous absolument délicieux. On était 10 à table et quand est venu le temps de dire \"bon appétit!\" ça été le silence complet pendant un bon 5-10 minutes. Comme le dit l'expression \"ça doit être bon si personne parle!\" Et c'était bon. Du tartare au thon en passant par le filet mignon ou le rôti de boeuf, et même le gâteau forêt noir, presque toutes nos assiettes ont été vidées et on est tous sortis avec un mal de ventre mais un énorme sourire au lèvre. À essayer au moins une fois dans ça vie!"}
{"text":"The Rib 'N Reef is barely even a stumble from the orange line which makes it pretty much perfect in my books already. Came here for a birthday party and our waiter looked like a Latin Gene Simmons so I knew that we were off to a good start.

I had the sesame crusted tuna which was done to absolute perfection: I'm talking fall apart in your mouth, amazingness. I had the mashed potatoes as a side and they were tasty as well. Only had a bite of the birthday boy's chocolate cake for dessert but it was completely awesome: not too sweet and had a crunch of something yummy in the middle, no way I could have eaten an entire piece to myself, but the bite was soooo good.

My dinner mates ordered lobster (it was fantastic), filet mignon which looked delectable and the roast beef...it was HUGE and they all pretty much polished off their plates. 

Great wine list with some really unique items, nice ambiance, fantastic service...you will not regret dropping some coin here!"}
{"text":"We had the the most fantastic meal out first night in Montreal. We started with the table side Caesar salad. I could have eaten the whole bowl myself. This is the only way a Caesar salad should be had. My husband had the sirloin done medium and he said it was perfect. I had the jr rib eye and it melted in my mouth. We shared the fresh spinach with olive oil and garlic and the poutine with pepper sauce. Fabulous!! He had the fresh sherbet as I could not eat another bite. 
We each had a glass of red wine. The cost of dinner was on par for other steak houses we have eaten at in NYC. 
Don't miss this gem right on Decarie Blvd"}
{"text":"Probably the best place in Montreal. I come to Montreal just for the food. Well, and Grand Prix! Nevertheless, this place has the best service I've encountered in a long time. Better steak than the best steak houses in NYC and the service is second to none. But I did mention that already. The restaurant is a bit far from downtown but to me,  it's the Il Molino of Long island . Beware, pricey! The wine list is probably the best I've seen anywhere else in the world. Don't be scared of the $4,000 bottles. They have plenty of normal wines as well."}
{"text":"Hum. Un endroit assez unique dans le secteur, un steakhouse haut de gamme pour compte de dépenses en folie. Bon, mais jamais assez pour justifier la note débile de 120$ pour le lunch pour 2 sans une goutte de vin. Typique dans la catégorie, viandes et poissons grillés, portions monstrueuses. Atmosphère très business et ce qui vient avec."}
{"text":"Rib'N'Reef is part of the staple steakhouses in Montreal along with Moishes, Queue de Cheval in which you won't get out of there with a bill less than 80-100$ per person if you eat a 3 services with wine.  You will get valet service even if you are the only car in the parking.  Without a doubt, there is no lack of service there but you do feel that it is a little bit snobbish though.  Apart from these details, I must say that for the few times I went there, the food is top notch.  Like the other steakhouses, they welcome you at the table with pickles, coleslaw, grissini and bread. The tartare, caesar salad and the Chateaubriand are prepared right in front of you like the traditional way. They bring the ingredients to the table and the show begins! Good place for a special occasion, i won't go more than one or twice per year with this price!"}

Very nice restaurant. Not so much trendy but classy and established. 
They offer to take your coat or you can keep it at your table. 
I had the 12oz sirloin steak and it was great. Other good meal options could be the 10oz filet mignon or the tuna tartare. The only thing is that they don't come with any sides. So you either have to order a side separately or get the table d'hote. A really good side was the rapini with squeezed lemon on top. The Greek salad as a side can be good but has too many onions. 
The cheese cake for desert is really good and comes with the table d'hote. 
We came as a group of 4 people so I got to see what other food look and taste like. 
They give you a hot towel at the end of the meal. 
There is a parking lot. 
There is a party room for special events."}
