{"text":"The food was good the service was good the price was ok the portions are large the only down fall of this place is the atmosphere its a little run down and could use a make over but over all pretty good i would reccomend"}
{"text":"No matter how good the fish or seafood is, Joey's fish is good, frozen chips are a deal breaker. Joey's Only chooses to use frozen chips. This restaurant advertises that they serve Famous Fish and Chips and Favourite Fish and Chips. This implies quality and it should extend to ALL food served rather than being selective. 

Too many restaurants consider potatoes an inconvenience they have to put up with rather than a line item that some consider one of the main focuses of the meal. I love, even crave, a properly cooked freshly prepared chip. For me the quality of chips must be equal to, if not greater than, the quality of the fish in a fish and chip establishment

The experience of good to very good fish was unable to rescue me from the depressing dilemma of having to eat the bland essentially tasteless frozen chips that graced my plate. Any potato flavour left was lost to the extra generous helping of seasoning salt they applied in the kitchen. Shouldn't that be my choice? Put it on the table for me to decide. This is not the restaurant to go for chips, which is unfortunate considering their fish is actually quite good.

What I find amusing is that they refer to their Fish and Chips as  \"Classic\". For me classic means created the old fashioned way, just like the British do, everything made from scratch. Frozen chips are hardly classic; they are more like some post-modern nightmare. It is certainly not \"Traditional\" English fare like they advertise, even if they use what is arguably the king of fryable fishes, namely Haddock.

If Joey's Only put back in the potato cutters, the soaking tanks, and the blanching friers, I would up the score to a four. The fish is a four but their chips bring the rating down to two stars. Regardless of all my griping about how potatoes should be cooked when served with fish, and god knows I have done enough of that here, I must emphatically state that the service, and attention, given to me by the staff was nothing short of excellent."}
{"text":"New Owner makes it worth coming back!
This was the best salmon I had for years. Food and Service are excellent."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. We came for all you can eat fish tacos, after having great tacos at Joey's Urban in Market Mall a couple of times. For $12 you get fries and two tacos of the same type, then you can keep ordering as many tacos of any type. I was afraid they'd try to fill you on fries, but the portion was reasonable and they were actually really tasty: hot, crisp, salty and spiced. 

The only disappointment was that there are only three types of tacos at the restaurant vs. five at Joey's Urban.  Also, while the one common sauce (chipotle aioli) used at the restaurant is tasty, at Urban there are different sauces for all the tacos. Also, there are more non-fried options at Urban.  The restaurant AYCE is good for sure, but not quite as good as a la carte Urban ($4 each). The service was friendly and prompt, and we enjoyed it overall, and I'm sure you will too. If a few more sauce or non-fried options were available, I'd give it a four like I did Urban."}
{"text":"I know what your thinking, 3 stars for Joey's Seafood is probably 2 too many. But honestly, this hole in the wall across from McMahon Stadium is not that bad on Tuesdays, when it's all you can eat fish and chips (drama-free) for $17.50.

AMBIENCE: I don't know what other Joey's Seafood restaurants look like, but the decor was very... seafoody--cheesy if you will. Nothing wrong with the staff, they were relatively cheerful, attentive, and polite. Within seconds of me finishing my fish they were there to ask if I wanted more. 2/2.5

FOOD: The $17.50 ayce fish & chips special on Tuesday includes Alaskan Pollock (the cheap stuff), Cod, and Haddock. Considering I probably wouldn't really be able to tell the difference after all 3 were battered, fried and topped with tartar sauce and ketchup, I had one of each for my first plate. And yeah, they kinda all taste the same. I enjoyed the meat of the cod marginally more than the other two but without the server pointing out which was which, I'd probably just be here talking about how I stuffed my face with fish and called it a day. If anything, the Pollock was battered the best and had the nicest texture to it, but the batter and oil started to leave a \"you better stop now before you get heart disease\" taste in the mouth. The chips were not bad, I am no potato expert but they definitely weren't hand-cut, I could care less though, I was there for the fish. It also came with a coleslaw which I didn't care for. I politely declined a top-up after my second plate and that was that. I don't know if I'll come back for unlimited fish taco Thursdays but you never know. 1/2.5"}
{"text":"It took a while for them to seat us although there were only a few customers in that night. That was fine as we were not in a hurry.
We ordered fish and chips and the food was okay, the fish was crispy. But my main concern is with their hygiene practices. My companion happened to visit the ladies room before we paid and she was appalled at the staff using the washrooms and then just running out quickly without washing their hands... That definitely left a bad taste in my mouth and won't ever go back."}
{"text":"We went here last night and was very happy with both the service and our meal, the last few times we have been to different locations and the food and services were just horrible but not here, if your thinking there all the same there absolutely not! This one is clean, friendly and delicious! We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Joey's is now under new management. New menu and very good service. We had fish and chips and it was cooked perfectly. Even the coleslaw tasted fresh. I usually don't like coleslaw but this was good.
We will be back again."}
{"text":"Friendly staff but $20 for 3 pieces of cod and chips ??? Small portions and crappy batter. Tasted like something you'd bake from the frozen food section . Crappy fries too !
Not the Joey's that I remember ."}
{"text":"Went for the all you can eat fish and chip night.  Fish had light batter with good crispness and meatiness to it tho it had none to very little seasoning.  The service was wonderful and it was a pleasant experience.  But the fish does need some sort of sauce for flavour."}
{"text":"We went there for dinner. There was only one other table that had customers when we arrived but the chinese waitress was not attentive at all. She was upset we had refilled our fries. We have been to Joeys before and the coleslaw refill was always free. We asked for two free coleslaw refills. We asked the waitress if it was free, she said yes. When the bill came, she charged us for the two coleslaw refill. It's so ridiculous. We asked how come it was free at the crowfoot Joeys? Her response was they charge at the 32 nd ave location. It's a food chain, all rules should be the same. Our useless waitress enjoyed spending her time talking to the other chinese guy that worked there rather than serving us, at that point our table the only table with customers. We spent over $80 for ok food and the worst service ever. I don't even think the chinese waitress understood english, she was a total idiot. We will never go back there, her attitude and bad behaviour ruined our dining experience."}
{"text":"unsure of why i paid over $30 for a tiny piece of bland, soggy fish with a dried up piece of lemon- no tartar sauce, a spoonful of mac and cheese, small box of fries and no drink. what????? 
i'm really mad about the lobster & shrimp mac and cheese. literally a small takeout styrofoam cup, and they didn't even fill it half way. just the bottom of the cup. got one small chunk of shellfish, other than that it was normal mac and cheese with a fishy taste. 
Feeling super jipped here, Joeys! would have happily paid $30 for this meal had it been up to normal standards which is why i didn't protest seeing my total. but when i received this food, i was extremely disappointed. will not be eating from here again."}
{"text":"So this location has been under new management for over a year and has been fantastic. But last week it got under new new management which was very evident by the atmosphere. This week got worse, over 30 minutes for our order, so we ordered two more tacos and 10 minutes later got one each, then a few minutes later we got 2 more tacos and then an entire two taco meal. 
New owner appears disengaged more concerned with telephone duties and sales progress.
In total our meal took 60 minutes for what equated to 4 tacos each.

Service was uncaring/pushed effort unlike the previous management which appeared to at least enjoy having you visit their establishment.

I will drive to calgary if i want to do fish"}
{"text":"This was an excellent dinner. We had the dinner for 2, and had a left over portions. We had the left over tonight.  The dinner for 2 was $24.00  2 fish + shrimp + 2 Fries + 2 cole Slaw. Wow. Awesome. 
Im coming back next week again."}
{"text":"Best fish and chips in Calgary. 

Consistently good. Awesome fries. Very decent fish tacos. Great value. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Omg I love coming here sooo much It's always super quick and delicious and reasonably priced. Staff are always so sweet too. I always get the halibut and shrimp it's the bomb. Their cheesecakes are sooo good, I like the keylime. Staff are always so sweet, I always leave in such a good mood haha. Honestly a little gem in this neighborhood"}
{"text":"We decided to try out this restaurant as we were close by and had few other options due to the busy time. So we wandered in and were greeted warmly and quickly. We sat down at a grimy table with plasticized menus and eventually ordered decidedly expensive lobster, scallop, and fish dinners.

We waited a long time--more than seemed reasonable for the number of customers (a sparse clientele is a warning sign!)

What arrived was drab and barely edible. For the price, we were expecting a lot more. Our lobster was rubbery and remarkably bereft of flavour. The scallops were soggy and almost inedible. The fish fillet, however, was actually quite good and elevates this review from a single to a double star alone! And, I should add, the best part of my meal was the broccoli and french fries! It's not good when a $30+ plate's best items are the sides.

For the price, I just couldn't ever see myself coming back for such mediocre food, no matter how pleasant the serving staff. Red Lobster is about on par, and 1/2 as much money. Next time, we'll drive somewhere before we submit ourselves to such bland overpriced fare."}
{"text":"From the outside and/or it's exterior setting you make second guess this place, but the food was pretty tasty and price nice! I went on Tuesday and had the fish and chips. It was fresh and portion was plentiful. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Not so good, if you are looking to go to Joey's Seafood, the one in Crowfoot is so much better. This one is in need of a deep clean everywhere (menus, walls, floors) and the food was not pleasing.
We were craving clam chowder so we pulled in to grab a bowl each and some popcorn shrimp to share. Service was OK (1 staff member on besides the cook and she was the hostess, server, mopper-upper) The food came out quickly, I can say that.
The clam chowder (barely lukewarm) tasted as though it was just popped out of a can and the popcorn shrimp were all stuck together, frozen of course but blatantly obviously so. Everything lacked seasoning.
We did not note that it was a 2 star dining experience until we checked in on Yelp so maybe we can do someone else a favor - keep driving! There are so many other restaurants in the area.
Note : WTH? You have to walk through the kitchen area to go to the washroom. Ick..."}
{"text":"The best Fish (Halibut) & Chips Ive ever had. I also love their light choices, blackend salmon with ceasar salad."}
{"text":"All you can eat fish and chips on Tuesday!!!! I love how lightly battered the fish is but the fries are meh...... instead get the Caesar salad. There's a yummy bottle of tartar sauce and ketchup for dipping. The service here is excellent. The waitress was attentive and friendly. The restaurant was quite busy but there was ample parking in the strip mall. I definitely would come back. Can't go wrong with all you can eat fish and chips for $16 a person."}
{"text":"It's been a few months since I've been to Joey's and boy was I surprised. Decent fish and chips can always be had but I have to say that this time I was blown away. I think the cooks and owners might have changed in this location but whatever it is the 2 piece haddock and chips I had for lunch was the best fish and chips I've had in a long time. The batter is light and stays crisp. It wasn't greasy and the real test... I was able to break the piece into 2 to find perfectly cooked fish in a light, crisp batter. Each mouthful was a light crunch in moist, flaky fresh fish. I'm giving it a 4 because the fries were good but not the best I've tasted. I'm still looking for the holy grail for fries. I'm writing this review a couple of weeks late but it's after I had fish and chips at another seafood joint which wasn't as good. Service was pleasant and efficient and food arrived quickly."}
{"text":"I was always skeptical to eat at this restaurant as whenever I wanted to go everyone said don't and told me horrific stories of how they got food poisoning after eating at a \"Joey's Seafood\". However, I really wanted to try it so when my family decided to go I went with them and left my significant other who was very negative about going because he was worried about getting food poisoning at home. I got a delicious fish burrito (I guess you could describe it that way). Specifically it was the wild fish burrito that is their feature item only from April 9th- May 27th, 2018. Ini t was wild alaska pollock, cheese, zesty lime rice, black beans, cabbage, pico de gallo and chipotle mayo. 
It was delicious. 
The next day, however, I got extremely sick for the next two days. It cannot be guaranteed that it was from eating here though as I am a teacher and it wasn't until halfway through the next day that I got sick so it could be anything! 
I would go back here!"}
{"text":"It's Tuesday night again and we had a hankering for all-you-can-eat fish and chips.  
Surprise, surprise, there's a new Joey's Only restaurant on 17th Ave in the strip mall beside The Himalayan.   We wandered in and were promptly seated by our server, who also took our drink orders right away.   Our fish and chips took less than 10 minutes to arrive at our table and the pieces of fish were gigantic(our son is a growing boy, so he did eventually ask for an extra piece of fish)!    The coleslaw was very fresh and had just the right amount of crunch.   
      We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We have had ok fish and chips here on a few occasions but got takeout shrimp this time, and blackened \"cajun style' fish. The shrimp tasted as though it had been sat out all day and reheated, the cajun seasoning bore NO resemblance to anything I've tasted in New Orleans or Acadie, and it was stone cold. The manager offered us discounts back at this restaurant when I complained of gastrointestinal distress! NOT going here again!!!"}
{"text":"The Fish here is pretty good. Nice enough staff but the place hasnt changed much in twenty years. I guess its says a lot that theyve been around soo long serving ok fare."}
{"text":"I don't think this is what Joey had in mind for his restaurants. Staying in a hotel behind this restaurant and thought I would give it a shot. This is pretty much a lower scale of the American restaurant Long John Silver's"}
{"text":"Great fish tacos made with fresh cabbage, tomatoes and chipotle mayo.
Fish & fries are awesome as well. Malt vinegar on the tables clearly shows they mean business."}
{"text":"I ordered the Cajun combo (basa and shrimp) and it was so flavorful and delicious. I ate every last bite!"}
{"text":"Consistent. By now anyone who has read more than one of my reviews knows how much I appreciate consistency. And courteous customer service. And good food. 
Now, I'll admit, I'm not a fish n chip aficionado; nor would I ever claim to be.  My mom isn't either. But she digs fish n chips. So when comes to cowtown she will demand I seek out a place that serves fish n chips. We've never sat down at either location. In fact, I ordered via telephone... both times and at different locations. Actually, I ordered  via Bluetooth  because that's an important detail. 
And placed the order ahead. By golly, the order was ready in 20 minutes and it was easily reheated 25 minutes later in the oven for supper. The batter is light, crispy and fried til golden. And the fish is flaky and moist. Fries were good too. The tartar sauce was ok.... it comes in packets when you take out. It could be revamped imo.  I'm not much into creamy coleslaw so I bypassed that immediately. 
It was easily substituted and everyone was friendly and delivered great customer service. 
So if you want to treat your mom to fish n chips at home get 'me from here. She'll probably appreciate your existence a little more."}
{"text":"In all honesty, I really don't know where to begin.    I was in the area to go to a party, but wanted a quick bite to eat before the festivites started.  It's way clear across town for me so I didn't know at the time what might have also been available in the area.

The meal started in a pretty normal situation, that is being seated and having a glass of water or two.  My gal and I were more or less the only customers in the resto (and were easily outnumbered by the staff).  I ordered a simple fish and chips, and my gal ordered a blackened fish filet.  What then followed was probably a comedy of errors and a horror in cuisine in a lot of ways.  Remember, we were the ONLY table there for the longest time.

- our meal took over 45 minutes to come.  I would ask and ask every 10 min, or so after the first 20 min, and I would be told by our waitress that it was only 3 min away.  
- when the fish came, mine was kinda ok, but my gal's was stone cold.  Worse, it was the wrong fish.
- they took it back, and then brought in another fish 10-15 later (again, what are they doing in an empty resto? running to the river and catching the fish? running to the closest supermarket?)
- my own meal was luke warm at best, and I was not all too thrilled.  Worse, when asked what the heck was wrong to get both our orders wrong in an empty resto, all I would get was clueless responces
- we were offered a cup of soup in the meantime, a lobster bisque.  After tasting that, I had to spit it out and push it away.  With a peace offering like that, who needs enemies.  It tasted literally like battery acid, with no lobster to speak of in the bisque and was totally unpalatable. As it was offered free, I didn't bother complaining as i was quite upset by then, but I'm sure they must have noticed me spitting out the soup and ignored it.
- we finally did get our dishes, the meal took well over 1 1/2 hours, in an EMPTY resto.  We were comped the utterly horrid soup but absolutely nothing else and was charged full shot.  I paid, left zero tip and blasted the resto the following night to their head office's email.

A few week's later, I had gotten a phone call from their office, and the rep their had gotten the story from the resto, plus my own email.  Instead, the office told me to make it up, they offered me a dinner back there at that resto.  I asked politely if it could be any other Joey's, as in all honesty, I really had no faith in their staff at all, and more importantly, I wasn't about to drive 80 min to and back across town (40 min each way)to possibly have another horrible meal.  Now I understand that that particular Joeys may be some franchisee, but head office should have the ability to accomodate a simple request like that.  Instead, he told me that it HAD to be that one, and ONLY that one.  I then simply replied that I'll simply refuse to go to ANY Joey's from hereon, as it's obvious that he wasn't going to actually provide any real satisfaction.  

I've since steered several people and myself over the weeks to other seafood restos, since there's no way on earth I'll ever let that disaster happen again.  If anyone from Joey's reads this review, take a look at the number of reviews I've written about restaurants and so on.  You've lost me and as many people I can warn for life people, and I was exactly the market you were looking for."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in ages and I thought I'd give it a go since we had some coupons to use up.  The place has changed a bit, gone are the kitschy sea-related trinkets that dotted every inch of the place.  Now it has a more contemporary feel.  We sat ourselves in a corner booth and the backing was not very stable at all.

Our server was friendly enough and answered all our questions. We had a few questions because the menu wasn't very straightforward (no prices for extra pieces or sides?)

I ordered the regular 2-piece Alaskan pollack.  The fish was OK, batter a bit on the light side, had to drown it with tartar sauce to get any kind of flavour.  The fries seemed to be made from frozen (just my guess).  The coleslaw is a bit of a joke coming in a small condiment container, but it wasn't that great anyways so it didn't matter.

After waiting quite a long while for our bills we decided to just pay up at the front.  I'm not going to be rushing back anytime soon unless I have a hankering for some average fish & chips."}
{"text":"Everything was perfect but you know what ? If you wanna go for all you eat don't eat too much fries:D after just 4 tacos I was full and it was sad:D"}
{"text":"This was the worst seafood meal I have ever had. My wife and I came in because we had heard reasonably good things about the chain as a whole. Boy were they wrong. We both ordered fish and chips, it was all you can eat, my fish was still raw in the middle and my wife's smelt and tasted expired. When we voiced our concerns to the waitress the table next to us said much the same and struck up a conversation about their off smelling meal. Now I'm no expert but for a seafood place you would think the kitchen staff would know the smell of bad fish, and how to deep fry something fully. 

Within half an hour of leaving, both my wife and I have become ill. 


AVOID AT ALL COSTS!"}
