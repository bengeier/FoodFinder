{"text":"I liked this place.  We grabbed drinks from the bar and played video games.  The bartenders were quick to take our order and quick to get our drinks.  There was a nice variety in games.  The prizes were ok.  I don't even want to think how much money we blew that day but it was fun."}
{"text":"Dave and Busters, meet your lame competitor.   Hey Kids! We've got video games!   Hey Adults we got booze!  Hey everyone! Get it yourself because our staff just wears the clothes, they don't actually do ANYTHING.  Actually, don't get anything for me, because your food is terrible. But I guess I could play some games while I wait... no thats okay, because the $10 game card I got roughly bought me 3minutes of the latest House of the Dead series.   I'm a dork, a nerd, a geek. I'll tell ya that right off the bat, I can play a video game, but not when the screen is so dark that it took me three clips to realize I was shooting my partner.  So the kids are having their learning curve spiked to infinite on video games while mom and pop go grab a drink. Hope you brought a few Benjamin's, because even for a beer, its going to cost you. Better just go across the street to the gas station and grab a few 40's and chug them in the car before returning to your table with the 'fam' to eat your food.   Wait, where's the food? We ordered an HOUR ago...  Aren't you glad you read this review first? Because I'm about to punch my door in frustration just reliving my experience with you."}
{"text":"Have been here 3 times now, always on busy nights.  I would never describe this place as quiet.  Depending on how close you are to the stage while the band is playing, you either have to scream at the person standing next to you, or talk very loudly.    Service at the bar has always been ok, if you can get close enough to the bar.  If it is too busy to get to the bar, you're not going to have much luck.  The waitress we had at a table one time was not the brightest crayon in the box either.  This is a place where a lot of d bags hang out.  If that doesn't bother you, then go.  If you're looking to actually have a conversation, go somewhere without extremely loud bands."}
{"text":"Eeeewwwww. Every single surface, from floor to table to video games to bar to seats, has not been cleaned in what seems like years. Everything is sticky, dusty, and sickening. PLEASE DONT GO HERE IF YOU VALUE YOUR LIFE"}
{"text":"Ok...place and atmosphere is dark. It has also received some bad publicity in the past. Cool food and warm drinks. I won't be coming back if I can help it."}
{"text":"Worst place ever... I didn't play any of the games because I wanted to get out of the place ASAP. The food was edible at best.  My friend got Mac & Cheese and it was cheese sauce from a bottle mixed with some pasta. I got a Caesar salad that was romaine lettuce covered in Caesar dressing, there weren't even any croutons!!  Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"Half little kid arcade, half adult bar. Both the kids and the parents can play. Sounds like a good idea and it probably is but I would hate to be the business owner who has there adult customers stumbling out of the bar and go where the children are in the arcade. Million dollar business and you don't take Discover?! Didn't stay after that. EPIC FAIL!!!"}
{"text":"Rude staff with tons of attitude.  The food is standard bar food. Id go down the road to the Fox N Hound. Much better food and the service is better."}
{"text":"This place screams, \"SUBURBS\"   Kinda cool to sit upstairs and watch the big screens.  On Saturday nights they have some good bands.  Service is very slow and food is mediocre at best.  However, their Ridiculously Hot Sauce is the best I have ever had....super long \"hang time\" in the mouth...good measure of a hot sauce!"}
{"text":"The worst place I've ever eaten at, EVER! I've been a server for 15 years and simply can not believe a restaurant like this is still in business! We went to eat here on a Tuesday. The website stated that cartoons would be playing on the big screens. As soon as we got there we asked a manager and he said they usually don't have cartoons on the big screens. We arrived at 6:15, when we were sat the host told us someone would bring us a highchair. 10 minutes later I went back down to the host and was told again someone would bring it to us. After 15 minutes we finally got a highchair. 15 minutes after that we flagged a server down and asked if someone could wait on us! We ordered and 30 minutes later the server came to our table and told us there was no more prime rib for my cheesesteak and I ordered a burger. 20 minutes later I flagged down a manager and asked where our food was, this was at 7:15 an hour after we got there! He assured us our food would be right out. 15 minutes later they bought all the food but my burger and said it would be right out. The server forgot to get my husband's beer that he ordered 30 minutes before and brought it 10 minutes later. When we were ready to leave we waited another 15 minutes for our check. We paid and left. By the time we left there it was 8:15! Yes, 2 hours for a meal at Boneyard!! We left and will never go back! Trust me as someone who works in the food industry when I tell you that whoever ranks this place higher than 2 stars are clearly working for this awful establishment!"}
{"text":"This was obviously just not my atmosphere, I would say. It might suit a small portion of the population of high school students or maybe freshman and sophomores in college. After that, no thank you. It has been years since I've been here but I remember the place even now--as one to which I would not return. It was kind of greasy and grimy. Dark and dreary.   Put nicely, Chuck  E Cheese is Camelot compared to this establishment. Actually, I like Chuck E Cheese.    I do not recall the food enough to comment on it except to say it was unmemorable.  How in G-d's name is this place still open?  After reading the other reviews, it's clear this place needs an intervention the likes of which could only be pulled off by a fairy godmother."}
{"text":"Wait staff is rude and more focused on talking to each other behind the bar. Service is slow. On the plus side this is a good place to see live bands if you can deal  with the club music played on breaks. The overall atmosphere is nothing like it used to be when it originally opened. Where is Jon Taffer from Bar Rescue when you need him?"}
{"text":"Kinda dank looking, but my kids had a good time.  They need to change the carpet."}
{"text":"Not my first \"go to\" place...but not bad.  Beer selection is ok.  Food is typical of this type of restaurant.  All in all... just ok."}
{"text":"It's a good place to go on a Friday or Saturday when they have a live band. I did enjoy trivia night even though I didn't participate. Some of the issues I have besides kind of high prices was the service. The bartender walked past my empty cup 5 times before my boyfriend got her attention. Another time I asked my bartender for 2 more beers and completely forgot about me until a half hour later he came over and asked if we wanted drinks. But the food is great the loaded potato soup is amazing."}
{"text":"Beer Farm? I'm not sure what that is... does anyone know? I assure you, this place is no beer farm, whatever the hell a beer farm is. I would assume a beer farm would be a place where high-quality delicious beer is born or maybe even served. So... yeah, none of the above qualifies for the Boneyard. Disappointing. I didn't see one decent beer on tap or in the coolers. Perhaps I missed it? I had a hard time trying to figure out what to drink here because of that. So, I drank liquor.   I can't say anything about the Mesquite Grill part of their name because I didn't eat anything on my visit. Drank my dinner, thank you very much.   Came here on a really crowded Saturday night. The place wasn't too bad overall. I would have liked it a bit better had I been able to walk without bumping into people and having to say \"excuse me\" every 5 seconds.   Best thing about this place is probably all of the fun games they offer. Many people say it's like Chuck E. Cheese for adults. True. Not as many games as Dave and Busters - but close. I didn't partake in any of that sort of fun but I wish I would have.  The service was pretty good for an extremely crowded Saturday night. Plenty of bartenders to go around and they were all friendly.   I'm not a smoker, but it's worth noting that they have a large outdoor heated patio for those that do smoke. Cough, cough."}
{"text":"First off, the service is off the chart slow and terrible. Second, I got a margarita, and I swear to you it was the worst margarita I ever had. I had everyone at my table try it to make sure I wasn't crazy. Everyone of them thought it was terrible. I asked the waitress to politely take it off the bill. She later came back and insulted me by saying \"the bartender said if you're going to try it next time, get it on the rocks, it's much better.\" As if I don't know what the hell a frozen margarita is supposed to taste like. I can promise you it's not worth your time or money to eat at this crap hole. If you are looking for slow service and sub par chow eat here."}
{"text":"Good place if you are looking to enjoy a big patio with friends. The bartender didn't have a clue about beer when my friend asked for a suggestion on a dark beer. He didn't even know what beers they had that were dark, a girl sitting down the bar had to tell him! The food looked better than it was. I ordered a grilled veggie wrap. There were very few veggies in it, I'm talked one grilled mushroom and a few onion pieces but the wrap was stuffed with lettuce. If there were cheese or dressing maybe it wouldn't have just tasted like lettuce in a wrap. Very bland."}
{"text":"Quick update:  Since it looked like the manager was somewhat interested in fixing the place by contacting the reviewers and try to make it right.  I emailed him, twice.  I emailed the party planner, twice.  If they wanted to discuss my review I'd be happy to help them with understanding my feedback.  No response.  Apparently, they are not interested in feedback.  I tried."}
{"text":"I went there today, and upon entering, i was greeted with a musty stench. It was as though the whole place had been wiped down with month-old dish rags; I should've turned back then. Once again, like the other reviewers, the place was eerily empty and that was another sign that i should high-tail it out of there; but alas, I was hungry.    Firstly, their drink selection is HORRIBLE. The mixed drinks are watered down and the draft beer selection leaves much to be desired. I ordered wing and fries (keep in mind that they had wing specials today). My food arrived within an acceptable amount of time; however, the fries were 'cool'.  The wings were skimpy and had been over-fried, they were had and it tasted like i was chewing seasoned wood splinters.   When I got my check I found that I was charged for three separate orders at full price (double the amount I expected to pay). and then I was given some BS excuse as to how/why the correct price. I didn't feel like arguing and couldn't stand to be in that place another second. I will never go back."}
{"text":"This is a great place for lunch when you're having a bad day. The servers are super friendly, you can sit at the bar! at lunch! then go play video games before going back to work, Super fun, and the arcade room is almost completely deserted at lunch.  The food here is good, no complaints. Love the chicken sammies, most sandwiches really, and the portion sizes are good. They have a lunch club and additional discounts if you live in Mayfield.  The only issue is service time. Upstairs you'll get great service but sitting at the bar and it seems to take forever (even with all the tv's to watch, and that's saying something!)"}
{"text":"Screw you Boneyard. Yesterday was the second time I called to find out what time served food until, was told 10pm. I showed up before 9pm and you were closed! AGAIN!!!! Never again Boneyard, Texas Roadhouse was open and the food and service were great, unlike the last time I actually got to eat at the Boneyard."}
{"text":"Video Games and Beer.  Terrible food, but who goes to a bar for food?  The beer selection is decent with quite a few taps.  The stage is the best I've seen in a bar this side of the Pecos.  The staff is, well, fun...  The only reason to go here is for the live music, so long as someone good is playing.  Or a game.  They do have a gigantinc screen for the games."}
{"text":"I'm rating this bar on 1 visit, so I feel like the place could be better than a 2 star, but we certainly had some problems.  For starters, we have ourselves to blame to for going on a night when 1988 (80's rock cover band) was blaring Bon Jovi & Journey all night long - and when I say blaring, I mean the music was so loud I couldn't have a conversation with my any of the 6 people sitting at the table with us..  The music aside, the service in this place was terrible:  We ordered a round of \"the shot of the month,\" which we couldn't figure out.  So we ordered another one - And it was pure juice - No alcohol.  So when the waiter came back we asked him what the deal was, he denied it.   Now, this is definitely the type of place you go to looking for a straight black-out: taking shots, chugging beers & dancing wildly to \"Don't stop believing.\"  This guy was clearly trying to slip one past us, but we weren't fooled.  So upon elevating our complaint to the manager, we were brought out 6 new shots of anything we wanted.  Long story short, stay away from this place if you want a normal environment.  If on the other hand, you want a place to lose touch with reality & blackout, give this place a chance.  Another good point - Labatt Blue lights were $2 each during the month of May."}
{"text":"A strange craving for sticky bartops, cheap drinks, UFC fanboys and Ed Hardy fashion brought me to the Boneyard this past Sunday to watch the Browns game.  This part restaurant, part bar, part arcade is the former site of a movie theater. Today, the completely renovated space still offers several reminders of the old digs. First off, the place is absolutely enormous. The outside front of the building still has the original marquee announcing events and happenings. Inside, there's an enormous arcade offering table games, video games and more. In the back, there's a two story bar/restaurant area with a balcony over-looking the stage. The stage area is where a twenty five foot diagonal screen calls home. On most days, an HD projector streams sporting events on this and six other surrounding screens. An onsite DJ alternates between the game-day audio feed and music during commercials. On the weekend nights, the place turns into a musical concert venue. The screen is lifted to reveal the elevated stage where cover bands play. In the rear, behind the stage, there's a newly built outdoor patio with plenty of seating, a full service bar and TV's galore. All in all, it's really an amazing space. I could only imagine the overhead that it costs to keep everything up and running.   As for the service, food and drinks, it's hit or miss. The food is your standard pub grub. Nothing fancy. Mostly greasy bar food. The beer selection is rather limited despite them having two dozen or so drafts. Most of them are generic domestics. I usually just get a Newcastle Brown Ale. The clientèle typically ranges from your average UFC fan or impersonator, jocks, frat boys sorority girls, to the average middle aged suburban dweller.  If you can get past all of that, it really is a great place to watch a game. If size is your thing that is. The giant cinema sized screens are something to be marveled. I don't know that I've ever seen something quite like it."}
{"text":"This is the place to go for game day Sunday. They have tons of TVs and a large screen for the highlighted game (Browns game, anyone?). They also do a free squares game and have good drink specials (mimosas, bloody marys, coors lt buckets, etc).   The Boneyard is certainly not an amazing restaurant, but the service is usually adequate and the food is decent. They also have a pretty good selection of draft beer.  I have played some of the games and they're okay, but it's not usually the reason I go there."}
{"text":"I use to go here after work all the time.. I mean who doesn't love $2 draft beer? But I went there with a group of co-workers on Thursday, July 5th and they ordered hot dogs.. Something simple right? It took over TWO HOURS to get them. Not even kidding you.. We kept asking the manager and he said that HE HAD TO SEND SOMEONE TO THE STORE to go pick them up.   He sent out nachos to our table and they got out there before the hot dogs. Once they FINALLY got the hot dogs, they still came out raw. I ordered Mac and Cheese and IT CAME OUT FROZEN! It sucks that we had such a bad experience because I like the vibe of the bar but I'll never go back."}
{"text":"Some of the worst service I've had in a while. Sat down alone a table on the patio following a frisbee game as I waited for a few of my teammates....  5, 10 minutes passes. No service.  Noticing there's a bar on the patio, I wondered if I had to go up there, but nope, I see a single waitress scurrying around, while a little busy, didn't even acknowledge me.   Minutes later, a couple of us and I went inside, hoping for better service at the bar. Nope. After a few minutes and barbacks and bartenders passing us without acknowledgement, one of them noticed our presence and happily asked to wait a minute.  The bar wasn't crowded, only 2 others at the 15 seat bartop.. Knowing better, we ordered 2 rounds for 16oz $2 summer shandy's (it was the monthly special, yes please!) and went our way back outside.   Almost through the 2nd round, the waitress on the patio approaches us for the first time, we order another round.   Minutes later, she unexpectedly brings out summer shandy cans, says the cans are 16oz, better value than the 12oz glasses. Standard pint glass are 16oz, you know right ?! Well, at we know she can read the can and can bring a combination of plastic cups and glasses which can we use to pour our beers....   Amid the numerous TVs on the patio, a couple which weren't turned on because our waitress thought they were broken, I remembered that, after traveling abroad and coming back to see mediocre bars in American suburbia like this, I hadn't missed it."}
{"text":"Latest stop on our Saturday 'pick a restaurant'!  This place has all the right fixings for a great bar.  Tons of beer, awesome atmosphere, VIDEO GAMES, and great menu of comfort food.   We are not food critiques, but when the waitress explains the food in such detail as she did, explaining how it was fresh made, not out of a bag frozen on a truck for decades, it sets a great  precedence for the meal.   We went here on a Saturday Afternoon and the amount of people there was appropriate for the time of day.  The atmosphere is much different at night but for mid-day, we were happy with the noise level and general disposition of the place.  Our server was very informative, quick with refills, and friendly... all the things you would hope for out of a server at ANY restaurant.  The food, oh the food, was delicious.  We went with her recommendations and shared the two dishes we got.  The Buffalo Chicken Mac n Cheese, while almost giving us a heart attack, was amazing.  Perfect combo of spicy buffalo and rich, creamy cheese.  A MUST try if you go.  The sandwich we got was what a sandwich should be, fresh bread, good portions, yada yada yada.  Try this place if your looking for some good comfort food, a good ambiance, and friendly service.  Oh, and when you done, you can play video games.... which is awesome.  Any suggestions for where we should eat this week, let us know?  Have a place your scared to try?  We would love to give it a whirl."}
{"text":"Crappy Food. Crappy prizes. Also don't like that tickets are put on a card, so much more satisfying when you win a huge string of tickets."}
{"text":"I've been to the Boneyard on many occasions from Bike night on the patio to random weekend nights to see a band play and have gone there to play games with friends and their kids.   It seems like each time is different.  I personally think the food is going downhill.  Wings were good the first couple times but were overcooked and not worth a crap the next few times.  The menu is quite extensive but food for me here is maybe 2 stars.    Entertainment on the other hand gets a 4 star review.  I just went there on Saturday and watched 1988 play, it was a riot.  Brought 8 out of towners there and they all had fun.  Service was on top of our drinks, music was great, bathrooms were clean seeing how many people were there, and if you want some R & R, they have a big patio or a smaller bar in the games area.  Given the area and what the other options are for dancing, its pretty much in its own little niche.  So go get dinner somewhere else and plan on closing the Boneyard down dancing and playing games."}
{"text":"The biggest draw for me here is Trivia night.  Wednesdays at 8, play for the opportunity to win free beer with your knowledge of random factoids.  Trivia buffs be warned: this is not your \"Are you smarter than a 5th grader?\" brand of trivia - this stuff will definitely test your limits!    Service was only ok when I went there most recently.  It was hard to get our waitress's attention.  Food is turned out of the kitchen quickly, which is a plus.  Food itself was good, enhanced the trivia night mood rather than detracted from it."}
{"text":"I had the BBQ Rib and pulled pork combo. It was horrible. Both items were swimming in BBQ sauce. There were so much BBQ sauce in the pulled BBQ pork and can't taste anything else.  Service was awful. The place was empty on Friday 7:30 p.m.   Not going back again. Upstair is pretty scary and dark place. More like a musty dungeon"}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere -- a converted old movie theatre.  The food is decent bar fare, but the main problem with this restaurant is the slow service.  No matter if I'm sitting at a bar table or in the dining room, the service is extremely slow.  Don't expect any refills in a timely manner.   I go here every eight months or so, on and off the past few years, and there has never been a time when prompt, courteous service was displayed."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go watch some football on Sundays; they have tons of TV's and everyone there is a football fan; and from every seat in the dining/bar area you can catch a glimpse of multiple TV's so you won't every really miss a game. The food here is good; but what is really awesome is the drink's they seem to be cheaper than most bars in the area. Also, I have been here when they had 80's night and it was awesome; even if others would consider it a bit lame.  One downside is that they have like a kids game section tied into this; I mean why on earth would you do that inside of a bar? I don't want to see kids there and the games can be loud and annoying, just expand it into a larger bar instead. And who the hell plays skeeball anymore?"}
{"text":"On my most recent trip to the Boneyard, we held a skeeball contest for work.  Unfortunately, of the four skeeball machines, one kept malfunctioning and had to be reset several times, and the other three couldn't add the score up correctly.  So our skeeball competition was pretty hillarious.  We had to keep score manually.  Nutty!  For dinner, I ordered an Italian sub with a side of sweet potato fries.  This time, my meal was absolutely delicious!  It was not a healthy meal, but I indulge once in a while.  The meats on the Italian were really yummy.  In addition to the standard meats, I noticed some thick-sliced pepperoni on it.  This sandwich was amazing!  It was served with a side of Italian dressing.    The sweet potato fries were perfect.  They were crunchy and delicious.  I'm liking the food here!  As far as the arcade goes, they spent the money to get all these games packed in.  Plus, they have a card system like Dave & Buster's.  But since the games are not in great shape, it gave me a negative perception of this place.  There was hardly anyone in the joint besides us, but it was Wednesday, so it doesn't matter that much.  I wonder if a bunch of kids go here on the weekends, which would justify all the video games.  It's a huge restaurant and arcade, so I doubt that you'll ever have trouble finding a seat.  Almost forgot!  The beer selection ON TAP is terrific.  I had a couple draft Yuenglings.  Delish!"}
{"text":"Great place for a night out! Have a very lively rock-ish band that played some newbies as well as a few throwbacks from the 90s. We grabbed dinner at the bar as well as drinks and were served both fairly quickly.  They offered bar service as well as booths/tables and also included an arcade to pass the time until the band started. I'd def go again!"}
{"text":"BAIT & SWITCH!  used a restaurant.com gift certificate, bringing the total from $55 to $30.   I signed a $30 credit card receipt.   Later, i see on my statement that they charged the full $55 to my card.   That's ILLEGAL.  I've called them three times to request a refund.   Each time I've been told that \"the manager in charge of charge-backs isn't available\".   Despite leaving messages, i've never gotten a call back.  If you DO go, make sure you PAY WITH CASH!"}
{"text":"Ugh.  This is not my kind of place.    I enjoy Dave and Buster's on occasion, so when we were having dinner with friends on the east side of town, we decided we'd give this place a go.  Bad decision.  There was a lame band playing Gwen Stefani that had the place packed (... weird) and lots of people meandering about with no real agenda.  They weren't drinking or playing games... were they there to find someone to hook up with? Just to waste time? Totally off putting.  All the bars had absurdly long lines - maybe it would have been more fun if I had an adult beverage to enjoy?  Several of the games were totally broken and you have to put your \"tickets\" onto a credit like card.  Seriously, no tickets?! What is the fun of acting like you're a kid again if you can't even get any tickets!?"}
{"text":"We went to the Boneyard in Mayfield Heights. Loved the fun, expansive arcade setting. The food? Meh. We've had better food at other area pubs. The service? Friendly enough but a tad slow. We probably won't go back, only because there are so many better options."}
{"text":"I reserved the Private Party Room upstairs recently for a surprise birthday party.  From the beginning the communication with Christine, event coordinator was great!  We were the only party that night, so we had the whole area to ourselves with our own private bar and restrooms.  The food was exactly what I ordered and everyone was raving about the wraps and the awesome penne pasta salad that were served.  The communication with our server Dave was great.  He promptly greeted me before the event while I was setting up and he discussed the time line of things, and that if I needed anything and didn't see him to contact someone at the bar to get him.  I didn't need much, but he was always checking in with me to see if there was anything needed or if I had any questions.  I really appreciated that since if I did need anything, I wouldn't have had to track him down.  It is a great place to have a party and will definitely contact them again if I have another event like that!  Everything was great, no complaints what so ever.  The price of the room rental was $50, and then any food has to be used through them, and there are plenty of options for food that you don't have to spend an arm and leg.  The room has a nice warm feel to it with oak accenting, complete with flat panel TVs through out.  I gave it 4 stars because I find I give almost everything 5 stars and I am now starting to develop a stricter system."}
