{"text":"Good place for a quick breakfast.
Prices are reasonable too: only $11 for a large plate of fresh scrambled eggs, with toasts, jam, butter and a small fruit salad."}
{"text":"Green est un restaurant servant des menus \"santé\" sans en sacrifier le goût!

J'y ai été pour la première fois avec deux amies avant de participer à une fête Halloween. Ma première amie a pris le sandwich au saumon fumé, la seconde a pris le sandwich au thon et je me suis laissé tenter par le sandwich poulet et tahini. Nous étions tous plus que satisfaits de nos sandwiches et des salades les accompagnant.  

Le seul bémol du repas était ma salade de légumineuse. Il y en avait tellement de poivre que j'en ai failli m'étouffer dans mon bol!

Le service a été rapide et professionnel. La commis en service a pris le temps de répondre à toutes nos questions. Que ce soit de la nourriture ou de la musique jouant à ce moment. 

Dernière note, il faut prévoir environ 15$ afin de profiter pleinement de l'expérience que Green propose."}
{"text":"My husband and I had lunch here recently on our trip to Montreal and it was fantastic.

We both had the salad and smoothie combo ($15.75). I had the Smoked Salmon Salad with a mango, kale and strawberry smoothie. My husband had the Chicken Caesar Salad and the same type of smoothie as I did.

First off, the salads are huge. You definitely feel like you get your money's worth. You also get a slice of olive bread with your salad. I love olive bread so I was a fan. My salad had mixed greens, tomatoes, capers, walnuts , an entire boiled egg sliced up, pita crisps, and lots of smoked salmon. It came with a lemony dressing on the side. The salad was amazing. The flavours, the textures, everything about it was great. The smoked salmon was fresh, as were all of the ingredients. My only complaint is that the olive bread was a little bit dry. However I wasn't expecting any bread with my salad so it was a bonus so I didn't really mind. 

The smoothie was excellent. I liked how they layered the different flavours so you could taste each flavour.

My husband's salad was romaine lettuce, with grilled chicken breast , croutons, and grated Parmesan cheese. The dressing came on the side and was the same dressing as my salad, so it was a little bit of an unconventional Caesar salad but my husband liked it none the less.

If you eat in, you order at the counter, they go and prepare it and then they bring it to your table. The staff were very nice. 

This place is great for a healthy meal. I was really full afterwards, but felt good (not gross like I do when after I eat greasy fast food).

I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Really fresh food, juice and coffee. Personable service in both English and French. It's a great place to get a relatively healthy, quick, yet tasty breakfast at a good price."}
{"text":"Delicious and healthy food.So may varieties to choose from. I will highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"GIANT tasty salads!

Enough said."}
{"text":"I ordered a chicken salad to go and they messed up the order without apologizing. Slow service and the staff is all over the place. Will not go back"}
{"text":"It's one of the only places in the downtown university area that has such a great variety of salads. They offer about 8 salads but you can pretty much customize your toppings and add chicken, turkey, egg, tuna, fruits, nuts, pita chips, feta, goat cheese, etc.

I love the goat cheese salads and probably have it almost every week. It's a large portion and worth the $13 in my opinion- also the lemon dressing is amazing. 

Casual spot and gets fairly busy around lunch hours. Oh and the brownies are pretty good too!"}
{"text":"My mom and I were getting blowouts at the salon next door and stopped by at this place for two espressos and some water prior to our appointments.  From the outside this looked like the typical small self-service bakery. 
We all know that espresso cups are tiny. In this case, our espresso cups were only filled up to the middle.  Yes, pretty much one sip at the most.  Two bottled waters and two tiny espressos for 15CAN. 
Would not return."}
{"text":"This is the best spot to get a quick breakfast or lunch near the convention center. They have a great range of sandwich, salad, soup options that are all very fresh and tasty. I was at a conference in Montreal and came here every day! They also have great options for vegetarians, vegans, and gluten free. 

They do excellent service in French or English. My favorite part was that the cashier graciously put up with my broken French every day, understanding that I was trying to practice."}
{"text":"My sister lives above this place and it is delicious. The coffee is great. Sandwiches are fresh. The salads are tasty and creative. I am a huge fan of this place!

I will definitely be back and I highly recommend it. 

The hours are different on the weekends and they have weird holiday hours."}
{"text":"This is a good place for a healthy lunch during the break of daily work. People can find various kind of salad and sandwiches. They also provide different kinds of omelette as breakfast and alcohol that is good for an afterwork drink. I wanted to have an omelette but I went there around 11am and all omelettes are offered before 10:30 if I remember clearly. So I ordered a salad combo with fresh juice of mango. The salad was delicious. I liked it a lot. The service was also very good. They allowed me to use the power inside the bar so that I could study there on my computer with my friends. By the way, this is a place for eating healthy food, talking with friends or business partner, but not a good place for studying or working for long time because there is no power besides the power inside the bar."}
{"text":"Favorite new place for salads! Super tasty salads and the price is really good! Their specials look great!"}
{"text":"Great place! I actually went to the one near the W Hotel in Old Montreal. Huge salads, nice sandwiches, and great decor! A little pricey but the food is very fresh and super healthy. It is also a cafe but I have yet to try a coffee. My first sandwich I tried was the Tuna, and it was really good. The next sandwich I tried was the ham & cheese but unfortunately it was so small! My trio was over 10$ and it was like a mini-sandwich! I wasn't impressed... On another positive note, I love, no I adore, how they have ice water with cups in the seating area so anyone can help themselves. That's awesome! I've attached a few photos."}
