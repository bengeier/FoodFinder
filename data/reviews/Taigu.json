{"text":"Outstanding Asian food and incredibly fresh ingredients. I had the best chicken curry ever tasted last week."}
{"text":"Food is soso, and the servant shows very nud unfriendly to us. Moreover, some foods were not as enough as it should have been steamed. Don't go"}
{"text":"So tasty! I am addicted to their knife-cut noodles! Very nice people and lovely atmosphere; this restaurant is a hidden gem tucked into downtown Middleton."}
{"text":"I am Chinese American and have been to China before. I ate here yesterday with my wife and the in-laws and was very happy with the food here. Everything here is made fresh from scratch: the scallion pancakes, the noodles, and the house secret hot sauce mix are all top-notch. 

If at all in doubt, get the hand-pulled noodles. The noodles here are the best and most distinctive Chinese food in Madison. We ordered a basic dish of vegetarian scallion noodles when we came, and the balance between the soy sauce, sesame oil, green onions, vinegar, and hot sauce was perfect and delicious. There are precious few Chinese restaurants who do this trick in the entire Midwest. Their cut \"cat's-ear\" noodles are also rock solid.

The restaurant itself takes its name from the Taigu region of Shanxi province, in northern China just west of Beijing, where the owners come from. If you know your Chinese culinary geography and stick to that region's strengths, you certainly won't go wrong here. Fugu is too sweet and Ichiban is too oily (even for Szechuan cuisine). Taigu has neither of these faults.

I can't speak to the quality of the more Americanized Chinese menu here, since we didn't order off of it, but given how good the noodles are, why bother? just skip straight to the noodles! And don't forget the hot sauce - they charge $0.50 for it separately, but it's important for the full flavor."}
{"text":"Taigu serves some very, very good noodles.

I went with two Asian friends (I'm white) and they both got the \"real\" menus while I got the gweilo menu. No harm, no foul, though: the server quickly swapped my menu for the more authentic menus and was polite about it.

The difference between homemade noodles and everything else is astonishing. I knew that going in, but when I actually got to eat the noodles, I couldn't think of anything else.

I've only been once, but I'm dying to go back."}
{"text":"My new favorite Chinese food restaurant. Had the spicy beef with ginger - amazing. Dan Dan noodles were also excellent, and fried dumplings tasted fresh and delicious.
Prices are a little high, but worth it. Large portions - could easily split the entrees between 2 people or take half for leftovers.
Dining area is quaint and comfortable - tables are not very private and no TVs. Great wait staff (friendly and personable)."}
{"text":"Delicious. Just like homemade in Shanxi Province. Environment is good. The waiter is very handsome!  I tried fried noodle with beef. My friend tried homemade dumplings. Just tastes great! Their chili oil is nice. They give each of us a bottle of chili oil. Love it!"}
{"text":"My go-to Chinese restaurant recently closed (RIP Double 10!) so I've been eagle eyed at possible new replacements. Taigu had been lingering in my Yelp bookmarks for weeks when today the right conditions finally coincided and I was able to try it. 

Much like my previous favorite, Taigu has two menus: Chinese-American and a more authentic menu. If you're a General Tso junkie, you'll find that, but where it's really at is the authentic menu. I sampled both the cumin beef and scallion noodles with beef brisket. Both were downright delicious, striking a great balance of heat, spice, and flavor. Neither seemed to be plagued with the common malaise of food court Chinese: too much sugar and salt. 

After much searching, I've found my go-to Chinese take out, the universe returns to equilibrium."}
{"text":"Service is extremely slow, took over an hour for it to arrive even when the restaurant is fairly empty. People working seem to be pretty lost. The beef noodle soup is worse than beef flavored ramen. I don't think it should be called a soup, tasted more like water with a hint of beef. And for the so called chives dumpling is terrible. The skin is thicker than those dumpling skin you get from grocery store, or even homemade ones. Filling is unremarkable. 

Tldr: taigu neither satisfies my traditional chinese food standard nor Americanized standard. Definitely not the top 10 in Madison-middleton area."}
{"text":"Food is tasty and in large portion. Highly recommend the handmade noodle soup and fried noodles. 
Great service. The owner actually chatted with us, trying to remember each of our names. I'd definitely come again with friends."}
{"text":"Amazing homemade noodles with simple and fresh ingredients! I had the boiled noodles with tomato and beef. It was tasty and not greasy. I sampled the stir fried noodles and they were good as well."}
{"text":"I love the handmade noodles!!  The pork dumplings were also very good.  This has become my go-to take-out restaurant when my wife takes the kids to her parents for the night."}
{"text":"My wife is a big fan of Taigu, particularly their noodles. I have found their \"American\" menu (they have more traditional options and more westernized options) to be decent. The meat tends to be little fatty and could be of higher quality (this can be said about a lot of Chinese food).

We've only ever done carry out and our experience with that has been good. Food is prepared quickly and is always fresh."}
{"text":"This place has decent food, when you get it. I called in an order, and they said 24-35 minutes. I'm sitting here and they are 35 minutes late, I asked her to check on it and they haven't even started it. This is not the first time this has happened here. I'll be finding a new regular place after this. When it was orient express, they managed orders a lot better."}
{"text":"Awesome homemade hand-cut noodles with chicken.  Also tried the beef with wide rice noodles and really enjoyed the dish.  The service was very friendly and took exactly as long as predicted.  Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Third time at this relatively new Chinese spot in downtown Middleton. First time we were impressed. Lovely owner served us. Food was excellent - esp Cumin beef and hot/sour soup. They did mess up on our order of squid with Chinese broccoli - bringing us broccoli sans squid. Gave them a pass on the ordering error. Second visit was with mixed results. Sand in Cumin beef and lack of spice. MSG seemed to invade a few dishes as well. Third visit was utterly off-putting. Arrived shortly after open and was informed they were sold out of pork cilantro pancake. No big deal - a little odd since it was listed on board as special of the day. When we inquired about lamb noodle soup special - waiter told us \"it is lamb w/ noodle in soup\". Yes, thank you for the incredible insight. We asked if he would recommend the soup. He told us people have different tastes, so he couldn't really tell us if it is good. Bizarre. 

The squid over Chinese broccoli, which we were wanting to try from our first visit, was not worth ordering. I guess squid in January in Madison likely is far from fresh, but this was like chewing on super balls. 

Three tries. Gastronomic strike out. Disappointed as Madison lacks good Chinese options."}
{"text":"Taigu is a great authentic Chinese restaurant... When we arrived to Taigu we had the option of 2 menus the American Chinese menu or the full on authentic Chinese menu we ordered of the authentic Chinese menu, and may I say it was really good... For appetizer we ordered Dumplings and Vegetables egg rolls they had a punch of great flavor! Then we ordered Chicken and Broccoli, Beef noodles stir fry and Vegetable fried rice everything was so good with a lot of flavor! The service was great they gave us many recommendations! I extremely likes Taigu and I'll be happy to return! 

PS: The plates of food are a pretty good size perfect for sharing!"}
{"text":"Fantastic hand cut noodles!  Restaurant isn't the most comfortable setup, but the incredible food more than makes up for it!"}
{"text":"The noodles are really amazing, but the eggplant and tofu dishes are as bombdotcom as they come.  The spicy noodles are straight up legit. The sesame tofu is a personal fav.  This restaurant is a real gem on the Madison dining scene.  Highly recommend for dining with family and friends. Big tables work great for large parties."}
{"text":"Food was okay, a little overrated. The curry chicken noodle was very bland and the soup was just okay."}
{"text":"Our first visit was a pleasant surprise.  While the area of town was crowded and busy, we found Taigu's open and pleasing.  We seated ourselves and where promptly waited on.   The waitress informed us that they have 2 menus, one is the classic Americanised Chinese menu and the other is their specialties \"true Chinese\" menu featuring their hand made, hand cut noodles.  We ordered from their specialties menu, starting with the savory scallion pancakes as an appetiser.   They are great.  slightly crispy and a little chewy.  Our main dishes arrived shortly after, large portions and piping hot.   We both ordered the hand cut \"cat ear\" pan fried noodles.  I had the pork version and my date had the shrimp version.  Both where great.  The restaurant slowly filled as we ate.  They where completely full by the time we ended our enjoyable meal.  Will definitely be returning.  I want to try their noodle soups."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places for Chinese food in Madison. The shanxi rice wine dishes calling me back to stuff I ate living in Shaanxi (neighboring province). Try any one of the house made noodles (cat's ear or otherwise) for a hearty indulgence. Yes it will be greasy, it's a fried noodle-- but it's greasy in the very best way. And you can cut that with the Chinese broccoli all garlicky and cooked in a delicious broth. If noodles aren't your thing the twice cooked pork and cabbage is very good. Oh, and trust me when I say you want the hot and sour potato threads. :)"}
{"text":"Delicious traditional Chinese noodle! I would recommend the homemade fried noodle and noodle soup, both good with chicken or beef. The dining environment is very nice as well. The waiter is welcoming and talkative. Best ever have in Madison!!!"}
{"text":"The best Chinese food in Madison, hands down! I've eaten authentic Chinese all over the U.S. & Canada and lived here 11 years. Pretty much everything else except Fugu and Ichiban disappoint. Hong Kong is ok. The noodles here are beautiful, the broth in the spicy soups rich and tasty, and the pork in the roasted pork soup is sublime! A bowl of soup is two meals worth, for $13. Go!"}
{"text":"Best noodles I've had in the Madison area hands down. Excellent texture and generous portions."}
{"text":"This is the most authentic place to get handmade Chinese noodles in Madison. The spicy beef \"cat-ear style\" noodles (kind of a Chinese version of gnocchi that is shaped like a cat ear) is particularly addictive. Also, their Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce is delicious.

Despite the fact that the wait times are sometimes outrageously long (to the point where some customers just get up and leave before their order is ready), we just can't stop eating here. 

Just make sure to get there early..."}
{"text":"Taigu is one of my favorite Madison restaurants. I've loved everything I've tried, and everybody here is very friendly. Getting dinner here always puts a smile on my face.

They have an extensive menu of noodle dishes, and it's tough to pick a favorite. I'm a huge fan of the hot & numbing noodles with pork and peanuts. The sauce is extremely good, and the homemade noodles have a great texture and density.

I also love Grandma's Sweet and Sour Chicken. The sauce is wonderful. It's not overly sweet or syrupy, and has a nice undercurrent of vinegary tartness. It's nice and subtle, instead of the over-the-top sugary sauce some sweet and sour sauces are.

The scallion pancakes are incredible, too. They're flaky and the just the right balance of crispy and soft. They're simple and delightful, and always satisfying. 

If you're in the mood for Chinese food, and are on the west side, you need to check out Taigu."}
{"text":"Cozy little spot. Lots of booths. Friendly service. And the food is awesome! Not a bad noodle dish on the menu, especially the hand cut noodles. Had the Spicy Curry Chicken hand-cut for the first time on Saturday and it was delicious. Plenty of curry and juicy chunks of chicken. Plenty for dinner with enough left over to take home for lunch the next day. As always the pork dumplings were delicious. So tender with a great fermented bean sauce on the side."}
{"text":"I wasn't totally impressed with this place. The food was decent, but lacked spice. The spicy food was not spicy at all. The woman working the front was pleasant and the food came out quick. I did order online, though, for quick dining. I was in the restaurant at noon and it was very quiet. I may give this place another shot. The woman at the cash register really talked up their homemade noodles."}
{"text":"So happy to find an authentic Chinese restaurant in Middleton! The scallion pancakes are a must-have, along with the hand-cut noodles. Excellent vegetarian options as well!"}
{"text":"First off, let me just say that the front desk guy was very nice. He smiled and seemed very happy to have me come in. 
I got the General So's Chicken lunch deal and two crab rangoons to go. It took about 10 minutes which is how long they said it would take. And I was fine with that, they have a nice waiting area. 
The chicken was good, better than I've had and the sauce was nice and not too spicy which I liked. The problem was the peppers, there were a few that were fine and a bunch that were charred to a crisp. I didn't realize this until I started eating, it was awful to find those black pieces in my mouth. They were very hard to pick out as they were quite small and paper thin. As for the crab rangoons, they were definitely light in filling but still good. 
Later that night I didn't feel so good and started having horrible stomach pains. I didn't eat anything after this and have since only eaten a granola bar so I can safely say it's from this food. 
I will not be going here again."}
{"text":"Newly opened Chinese home style cuisine. Great taste, big portion, fresh ingredients. Noodles are all hand-cut. The only suggestion is that if it could take less waiting time I will come back more frequently even when I happen to pass by that area and craze for Chinese food."}
{"text":"A friend and I looking for a quick bite stumbled upon Taigu, an unassuming Chinese restaurant without a big bright sign. It was just 15 before closing time and they thought we wanted take out, but we didn't. There wasn't even a hint of disappointment or annoyance; we were welcomed with a smile and seated. The decor is unassuming too, but the friendly service itself makes the atmosphere warmer. We steered away from dishes you can find at every Chinese restaurant, and instead opted for something different. The scallion pancakes were delicious, as was a beyond generous portion of freshly fried meatballs, both starter dishes. Then we had a noodle dish, and those are the house specialty. It was filling, fresh, and tasted great too.  Taigu was a really pleasant surprise, and neither the food nor the service disappoint. We're looking forward to another visit!"}
{"text":"I wanna say that this restaurant is cute on the inside but the food is just average. For people who probably dont know much about real good Chinese food this place would probably be great. However for those like me, it was a bit underwhelming. I ordered a chicken and broccoli dish once time and it really wasn't good. The sauce tasted like they only put a ton of soy sauce to flavor. It was probably the least favorite chicken and broccoli dish I ever had and I've had hundreds. 

I decided to give it another shot because my sister claimed someone said Taigu had great homemade hand pulled noodles. The noodles had great consistency but it just tasted like a basic lo mein dish. Again, very underwhelming food but not horrible. Food would probably get a 2.5 star from me but the staff were very nice.

Also parking there absolutely sucks. There's rarely ever parking in the lot (its not really a lot, just a diagonal strip of a couple of spaces off the street facing restaurants) and street parking is pretty unavailable too since they've been doing construction nearby."}
{"text":"Loved Taigu! A very cozy, comfortable, and clean restaurant. I think the woman working was the owner when I was there, and she was just adorable and so kind. Food came quick and I will admit the portions are huge. I didn't mind, because I brought the rest home and enjoyed it again the next day. So it re-heated really well! Can't complain about getting a good bang for your buck. Very cute & a lovely place. I have an Asian heritage, so Taigu is definitely a comfort place that feels like a little bit of home. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"The noodles here are really good! I had the beef brisket noodle soup. It is hand pulled! And the waiter is pretty nice! But the service is slow"}
{"text":"Ohh Taigu, one of the places I go to often, partly due to being close-ish to home, and partly because the food is yummy. The place that when I tell them my name, they immediately know my order to a tee.

I usually get an order of chicken fried rice, minus the onions. I ask for a size small, and the kind gentleman that typically answers the phone tells me that he will make a \"special order\" for me (they don't typically make anything less than a 'large' order of CFR). I appreciate this gesture because I really can't eat a large order, and I'm not a huge fan of re-heated, next-day rice. The steamed, pork dumplings are tasty - Especially when doused in soy sauce. The beef lo mein is also quite good, and I recommend it to everyone. 

Portion sizes are decent. Prices are a little high. Call ahead and your order is usually ready within 25 minutes. Friendly, accommodating staff. Lots of seating!"}
{"text":"Three of us ate here on a Friday night with one being a nine year-old.  The inside is pretty nice, especially compared to similar places.  The staff were very helpful and friendly.  There are two different menus.  One is the Chinese-American menu you see most places and the other is the Authentic menu.  We only looked at the Authentic menu.  We ordered two of the homemade hand-cut noodle dishes.  One was a pan-fried noodle with pork and veggies and the other was a boiled noodle with hot and spicy beef.  We also had the scallion pancake and an order of boiled dumplings.  Everything was outstanding.  We noticed another table of regulars that were speaking Chinese to the owners had some interesting looking veggie items so I asked the owner what they were.  Hot and sour cabbage and a Chinese broccoli.  Apparently they are not on the menu so she offered me a small take-out container of the cabbage for free.  I ate some at home and it too was delicious.  Definitely best Chinese on the west side of Madison."}
{"text":"Fantastic new restaurant! Beautiful interior, friendly atmosphere, amazing food. We had the beef stir fry hand-cut noodles, pan-fried dumplings, and scallion pancakes. All were very delicious and the service was excellent. Will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp and decided to give it a try while in town. Did not disappoint. 

I had a spicy noodle dish and it definitely had some kick to it, but the overall flavor was spot on. Worth the 20 min walk from my hotel and someplace I'll revisit when I am back in town."}
{"text":"The noodles are awesome. Small operation so it takes a bit of time, but we think it is worth the wait. The owner is friendly and makes amazing recommendations."}
{"text":"I was in town for business and decided to give it a try. I was not disappointed. The homemade spicy noodles with chicken, shrimp and beef were excellent. It was perfectly spaced and there is so much I had to take some home. I also started with a pork eggroll and it was very good as well. Full of ingredients and crunchy on the outside."}
{"text":"It's a Chinese restaurant, but it's a shame that they are not very nice to Chinese?


To be fair, their food is fine"}
{"text":"All the reviews are spot on. The noodles really are amazing and the portions are huge for the price. We ordered dumplings, 2 noodle dishes, sweet & sour chicken and orange beef. All was fantastic.

The reason this did not get 5 stars is because the service is so incredibly slow. It took our table of 4 over an hour and a half. We ordered pretty quickly after arrival and our food took 45 minutes....for the first dish. All dishes came out one at a time over the span of 10 minutes. If the place was busy, completely understandable, however, the restaurant was less than 1/2 full.

I would definitely come back and recommend, but make sure you carve a few hours out of your schedule.

Also, no adult beverages served here, which made the time seem to go even slower."}
{"text":"Tiagu is neither authentic chinese nor american chinese food, its just bad food. In general the food was underseasonsed, chewy, greasy and cold."}
{"text":"Have picked up carry out several times and the food has consistently been the best Chinese I've had since moving from Chicago! All the home made noodle dishes are especially outstanding. The food is NEVER greasy, the ingredients are good quality, and the servings are very generous. I'm SO glad they came to Middleton!"}
{"text":"Dined in recently and it was a slow evening. The restaurant was dimly lit and the seating looks like it is in transition from log picnic benches to banquet tables. There were three other parties dining in and two were very loud, with one watching a game show on their phone. Sounds and conversations made the atmosphere feel congested and uncomfortable to be in. 

We ordered the pork belly with tofu and beef chow fun. The pork belly and tofu was the better dish. The pork belly was cooked well with cuts of tofu that looked like they had been soaked in soy sauce beforehand. The outside of the tofu strip was a dark brown and tasted salty, while the rest was the usual cream color. Not really sure how it is prepared, but I've never had tofu served that way before. The chow fun was a let down as it was slathered in oil and had little flavor. I had to put extra soy sauce in the dish, something I dislike doing-ever. 

I'd skip the dine-in experience and order takeout instead."}
{"text":"Best chinese food in the area.  Staff is very very friendly.  I ordered online for pick-up, food was still hot and on time."}
{"text":"The hand-pulled noodles are a delightful change to your ordinary Chinese restaurant around Madison. They are so tasty, and the portions are huge!"}
{"text":"Good Chinese food from my first experience. Not necessarily leagues better than other typical places. The general tso tofu did not have broccoli which was slightly disappointing. Inside the restaurant was clean and service was fast and friendly. Prices seemed a little higher than other Chinese restaurants. Will try again to learn more of the menu."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Madison! And also the best Chinese restaurant around. The food is always perfectly seasoned (never too oily at all) and great and the service is very prompt and friendly!! 

My favorite is their specialty spicy Taigu noodles! THIS IS A MUST GO IF YOU ARE IN MADISON!"}
{"text":"Definately, go for the hand cut noodles they are delicious.The house soups are also fantastic. The pork is always great, but my fiance always loves the spicy beef."}
{"text":"We heard of this new restaurant and thought we would try it for a Friday lunch.  We arrived at 1 PM or so when the lunch crowd had begun to filter out.  We were greeted by a nice lady who invited us in.  Interesting seating furniture.  There are a number of booths consisting of benches and wood log type backs.  Me, the Asian, said it reminded me of a Northwoods log cabin styled restaurant. My spouse. caucasian, disagreed and thought it had very nice simple clean Asian lines.  The restaurant was very clean and well lit.  We were promptly given menus.  It was nice to see a smattering of handmade noodle dishes and other specialties alongside more mainstream American-Chinese lunch specials. Apparently, the specialties here are the handmade noodles.  We ordered the hand cut cat ear noodles with ground pork and eggplant. (Be assured. these are not real cat ears, just cut in a certain fashion. Although I do not know why they call them cat ears as they did not resemble cat ears to me).  We also had the beef ho fun and an order of scallion dumplings. All were delicious and served hot and plentiful.  We asked for some hot sauce and were brought a small dish of sauce consisting of ground chilies, vinegar and some other spices. Delicious and reminiscent of what they would serve at the old Hong Kong Wok restaurant in Hilldale (which was fantastic). This sauce was not as good as Hong Kong Wok's, but I was glad to have something close to it.  I thought the prices were very modest; the service, very welcoming and friendly. Definitely looking forward to going again and trying the other menu items, including dinner.  Particularly, I give it five stars here because the staff seem generally appreciative of their guests and have clear pride in what they are serving shown through their attitude and the actual food presented."}
{"text":"Despite being a bit far away, this is the family's new favorite Chinese spot. They make their own noodles and they are delicious! Meals are a little bit more expensive than some of the other places in Madison, but I think the quality is also a bit better so I'll pay it! We got a take out order for the whole family and everybody was happy with their meal. Those who did not order their noodles were sad that they didn't. The portions were generous, but it was sooooo delicious I ate it all anyway. I really do want to explore more items in their menu, but the noodles will be hard to pass up..."}
{"text":"I already had pretty high expectations going in because of all of the great reviews, but Taigu exceeded them! This is officially being added into my lunch rotation. I chose stir fried homemade noodles with chicken, which was delicious! There was enough left over to take home, which makes me very hungry for dinner already! It came with 2 spring rolls, which were the perfect size for an appetizer. They were quite tasty as well. I had seen photos online of their scallion pancakes, and I decided I must try them. While I probably ordered way too much food, I scarfed most of it down, and I really enjoyed the scallion pancake! Everything was very scrumptious, and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We had dinner here last night. It wasn't crowded but had a steady stream of takeout orders. This is Chinese food like you have never had before. It was fine dining style. When I think of Chinese food I usually think - quick, cheap, greasy. This was nothing like that. 
The decor was beautiful, the tables were clean, there was a server. We got real plates/silverware/glasses/chopsticks. Nothing disposable. The food took the average time a sit down restaurant would take to make. AND it wasn't greasy.
So if you are looking for a late night drunken food place. This is not it because 1. it's not open and 2. It won't satisfy that need. 

The food... we started out with an order of scallion pancakes. This was like a scallion paratha (indian stuffed bread). Loved it! Kiddo ate half of it. 
For our main course we ordered sweet corn egg drop soup, stir fried noodles with egg and vegetables, tomato and egg boiled noodles. These guys make their own noodles and they were DELISH!! Everything tasted fabulous! The soup was pretty sweet - we added some hot sauce to it and pepper and it was perfect! The noodles were so yummy - totally different flavors. I can't decide which one I liked more. The portions are pretty big and we got a few to-go boxes."}
{"text":"Best hand rolled noodles in Madison. Wish there were more meat and less salt though. But the scallion cake is mediocre."}
{"text":"Ordered food for delivery (they only deliver within a 3 mile radius) for the first time here, so I can't speak to the ambience or in-dining service. With small children at home that I don't always feel like wrangling in a restaurant, really great food that can be delivered or picked-up is a major plus for me. Delivery charge is $5 and you must order a minimum of $35 (sub-total, so before the delivery fee and tax). They list the expected delivery time, and assuming it was peak delivery time (Friday evening), our order showed up well within the window of time they gave. 

Taigu is making me reconsider my years long avoidance of Chinese food after too much crappy American style Chinese take-out, combined with access to an abundance of much better Vietnamese/Thai/Japanese food. 

Dumplings, spicy-beef noodles, and hot and sour soup were all amazing. The spicy beef was right on for the level of spice for me, which is a good kick without breaking into a sweat. Only wished there was slightly more meat in the dish, and I say that as someone who is happy with a moderate amount of meat in dishes I prepare at home. Again, I don't have much to compare to, since I haven't had good Chinese food in well...forever. 

Definitely will be back for more!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here twice in the past month since moving to Madison, and we absolutely love it! Very casual and quiet place or at least the times that we have gone.

From seeing reviews on this place, we decided to try the special homemade noodles. Did not disappoint!! It comes with chicken, beef, pork and shrimp. We just got it with the chicken and beef and it was delish! Portions are huge. Definitely a must try when you come here. Although there's more on the menu, can't help but come here just for the noodles! Also, the noodles still taste amazing the next day when take home for left overs."}
{"text":"Best noodles in town!!  Spicy is highly recommended!  Loved everything we tried and I can't wait to go back!!  Thank you, Hong Gao!!  You're a great host!!"}
{"text":"It is all about the noodles. Yes it takes awhile. Go home and try hurrying your mother making the best noodles you ever had. I never give 5 stars but this deserves above and beyond recognition. My mission is to try every hand made knife cut noodle dish they serve."}
{"text":"Best noodles in Madison, Wi! These hand cut fresh noodles are addictive, you can taste the quality of the ingredients and the freshness. Staff is extremely nice, the menu is fun and appealing, I highly recommend Taigu to everyone."}
{"text":"Food - 5 Stars
Dishonesty - 0 stars

The food here is amazing. The poached chicken is better then most I've eaten in China. The Hot and Numbing noodles are just phenomenal! 

However when the bill comes, it always requires a lot of extra scrutiny. Last time we ate there the whole poached (pre-order 1 day ahead) was on a sign for $18.95 sitting directly in front of the cash register. When the bill came they tried to charge 23.95. We ordered Green onion pancakes (4.95) but ordered them with Pork and Cilantro (+$2) First off there was no pork added, but at least they called out on the menu the additional price, But when the bill came they charged $7.95 instead of $6.95. 

This isn't the first time we've had this problem here. And it wasn't a mistake, the same guy who takes the orders and charges you is the same guy who is there every day and has been for the last few years. 

The first tip off was that he didn't want to bring the bill to the table, he just said come up to the register and we'll settle your bill. Of course they don't want you sitting at the table with time to review your bill before paying for it.

This wasn't the first time we've had problems with the bill here, they always immediately fix the bill when you point out problems, but you have to point out every single problem. if you don't point it out, they will happily overcharge you for anything you didn't catch. 

The prices are already pretty high here, 14.95 for a rather large plate of noodles, but they are absolutely delicious and worth it! I don't mind paying their high prices for the quality, but the scamming a few dollars here and there... WHY? 

I would suggest eating here, but taking a menu with you when you settle your bill. And hey if they \"make a mistake\" post here on Yelp about it!"}
{"text":"I've had my eye on this place for awhile now...the excellent Yelp reviews kept rolling in. Plus any promise of hand pulled noodles (or any sort of delicious Asian noodle for that matter) always catches my attention. Yes, the place is unassuming. I agree with Alan K. in that the booths remind me a log cabin. It doesn't quite fit. This definitely isn't the type of place where you sit and think \"oh wow, that a great space, I wish we could chill here all night.\" But who cares??? Doesn't really matter-you aren't coming here for the ambiance. You are here for those hand pulled noodles. I had the spicy beef noodles and while not overly spicy, it definitely has more kick than the usual promise of spice 'round these parts. If you don't like spice, heed this warning. The noodles, as promised, were amazing. The beef was cooked perfectly and was plentiful. The dish itself was easily two servings. Again-caution on the spice-the leftovers definitely had even more of a kick then they day before. My bf got the special spicy noodle soup. Same amazing noodles, completely different flavor profile. Super yummy. The soup comes with a mix of beef, pork, chicken and shrimp. They don't skimp on the proteins by any means. We also tried the pork and scallion dumplings. They were average but the dipping sauce was divine. Excellent value given the amount of leftovers we had.

It's tucked behind Barriques in Middleton, across the street from the post office. There are two separate menus-one with the more traditional Chinese dishes and another with American-Chinese dishes. I'm not a fan of the latter so didn't look too in depth at it but a quick glance saw the usual suspects-sesame chicken, General Tso's, etc.

Yes, the service is a bit slow and they aren't the most attentive. Though I do agree with other reviewers in that the staff seem genuinely appreciative of your business and really really want you to like their food. Lucky for me this place is near my office so I'll be able to check out their lunch specials. Seems a lot of their business is takeout-there was a steady stream of customers picking up orders almost the entire time we were there (and it was an off time-late lunch). They also deliver."}
{"text":"Update. 

I'd consider myself a regular lunch patron. The food is still good and the service friendly, however they have considerably cut their portion sizes and raised their lunch noodle special price twice in the last 6 months. Initially it was $9 with soda, then $10 with a soda, and now it's $10 without a drink.  

I'll still go back, just much less often."}
{"text":"the reviews were so good for this place went to check it out... got seated and after waiting 25-30 minutes with no interaction, left to Takura 88.  I thought it was weird that the entire place was full but only one or two tables were eating.  bummer"}
{"text":"Best / most authentic Chinese in Madison. Signed up for Yelp just to write this review, and to say that the people giving it bad reviews have no idea what they're talking about. Skip the Americanized Chinese options and go straight for the authentic menu. If you know good food you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is an overpriced ordinary eatery. We had scallion pancake and the special Taigu noodle. I will not recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"If you like dumplings and noodles, this is the place to go.

I'm kind of upset with myself for taking so long to try Taigu. I had it bookmarked for at least a year before finally giving it a try. Every time I have been to Taigu, I walked away happy and satisfied.

Taigu is a small, homy restaurant with a menu that isn't too big. The place usually seems fairly full with regulars, but it's never loud. Everything I had has been pretty great, but I never leave without dumplings and a noodle dish since they're made in house. I don't think you can possibly go wrong with any of the noodles on the menu. My favorite is the stir fry noodles with roast pork and black vinegar. Despite vinegar being a main ingredient, the dish isn't overly sour and actually adds the right touch of tangy acidity. I also really like the dan dan noodles; the dish has a bright, tangy Szechuan flavor without being overly numbing or spicy. My favorite entrees so far have been grandma's sweet and sour chicken and jalapeno beef with pickled cabbage. The beef can get overly salty because of the pickled cabbage, but it's otherwise addicting and delicious. The chicken has a pretty normal sweet and sour flavor like you would expect, but they're fried to a crispy perfection. You know how sometimes you crave something like Panda Express instead of really authentic Chinese food? Grandma's sweet and sour chicken will answer your prayers.

I've had some dishes that I thought were just ok. The Taigu spicy noodles that everyone seems to order are good, but they're kind of boring. It's just stir fried meat, vegetables, and noodles; it's nothing you haven't tried before. I found their mapo tofu to be pretty average; it's good and hits the spot when you're craving the heavenly soft texture that only mapo tofu and rice can deliver, but it's kind of mild and doesn't have any unique flavor to it.

Now, here's where Taigu wins over my heart and my 5 stars: their service is wonderful. All the employees are so nice and helpful. They greet you politely, answer any questions about the menu that you have, and they listen to your special requests. For example, my fiancee recently had her wisdom teeth removed, so they helped us pick out a soft noodle and tofu dish and made the noodles extra soft for us. They treat you like family. I get all warm and fuzzy just thinking about how nice they are.

Because of the great food and service, Taigu has become my default lunch spot for lazy Sundays when I want a comfortable and quiet atmosphere and some Asian comfort food. If you're looking for good noodles near Madison, make your way over to Taigu."}
{"text":"I just ate there and I wanted to get this done immediately as I'm on a business trip. This place is a tough call for a rating. Up front...the food was excellent. The dumplings were perfectly cooked and tasty. The spicy noodles were also very well done. None of the shrimp or meat pieces were overcooked. Even being a \"spicy\" dish, it still had a lot of flavor.

The bad...the dine in service was terrible. I was given a menu and told to seat myself. I was served a can of soda and a straw (no glass offered). I had to ask for chop sticks. I was not checked on once during the meal. I also had to wait at the table for longer than I'd prefer for the check. The cause of the bad service was quite obvious. There was just one guy playing host, waiting 10+ tables, handling all the to go orders, running the register, and even clearing tables.

Because of this, I'm going to let it slide as part of my rating. While I doubt I would dine in here again (even if I lived here), I would definitely list this as a \"go to\" place for take out. If they got more help they could easily give the other places in the area a true run for their money."}
{"text":"Favorite new place!  Small establishment but still many tables inside to grab yummy Chinese food.  They are known for their hand pulled noodles so we tried stir fried spicy noodles.  We also tried pork belly with tofu and onion scallions.  All was very flavorful.  The noodles are perfectly dense and chewy and not sticky.  The pork belly dish was substantial and the tofu was kinda firm which I liked.  Can't wait to go back and try the noodle soup."}
{"text":"I haven't tried the new ownership yet because the old place was such terrible quality. I have to say I'm glad I gave the new business a try! It was so good! The food was such high quality and the flavor was amazing! It tastes great even as leftovers! The chicken was not what you would expect from a restaurant like this -- so much better. This is my very first review and I had to write to others about just how good it is. So happy to have this place close by! Thanks for providing quality, great tasting food! The only negative was the $5 delivery charge... We opted to pick up because of this. I'll be back, for sure!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend the scallion pancake ??? as appetizer.

For main dish, you can't go wrong with hand-cut beef stew or stir-fried noodles!"}
{"text":"Delicious! My SO says this place is as authentic as you can get (and in the middle of WI no less!). The noodles were delicious, handmade and perfectly chewy. We tried the eggplant and beef hand pulled noodles as well as the spicy beef soup and a scallion pancake to start. 

The scallion pancake was nice, hot and crispy (can't really go wrong). The portions were nice and large for our entrees and we had plenty of leftovers. The spicy soup was good, light in flavor and tasty(but a little pricey for what it was). The star was the eggplant and beef noodles which were nothing short of tasty! Slightly greasy, if you ignore that part, the flavors and amazing! Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Taigu shall be renamed super double awesome noodle Chinese dish palace. I had N2 which has shrimp chicken beef veggies you name it over the best made from scratch noodles that I have ever had. And so spicy I was crying hot tears of joy by the end of dish, so super fantastic good!"}
{"text":"This is such an authentic place and really brings me back to China. That was how good my experience here was! If you want AUTHENTIC Chinese noodles in Madison then you need to come here. I will definitely be coming back frequently. All of their noodles were good and so was their pancake. Will try their other food next time!!"}
{"text":"Joining Dumpling Haus as a quality west-side Asian dumpling-joint option, Taigu delivers. Not literallly -- I think you have to pick up your takeout -- but definitely figuratively. The pork and chicken dumplings are accented with colorful, fresh vegetables (carrots, shallots, ginger, etc., -- is ginger a vegetable?), steamed or pan-fried just right, and presented to you with a friendly smiling face, the latter of which will be shared by you after your first bite. For carb-conscious reasons I have not tried the noodle-bowl options, but I'm confident you will not be disappointed if you do. The only hassle can be parking from time to time, especially if the nearby pubs are busy. The design of the parking lot is the stuff mandatory-minimum sentencing was invented for."}
{"text":"One of the better Chinese food places around Madison. We ordered rice noodles with Chicken and they were good. General Tso is good too, it's not so commercial like everywhere else. The spicy noodles made in-house are great! On the weekends during busy dinner time, expect to wait...good places have them!"}
{"text":"PROS: Perhaps authentic, large portions, reasonable prices
CONS: Greasy!!!

Portion sizes are large, but they are generous with the carbs and less generous with the vegetables and protein. I had like a couple measly slices of protein and vegetables, mixed with a mountain's worth of oil-slick noodles. Flavors were very average Chinese takeout-style. Although I'm no longer used to eating overly oily foods, the amount of grease used in the noodles recommended by the waiter was probably enough to coat my frying pan 10 times. You know that sensation in your stomach when you eat too much greasy food and feel sick and queasy afterwards? I definitely experienced that here --- a feeling I haven't had in a while. I have no plans to return, but I can see why people would consider the place authentic."}
{"text":"Moved her from Chicago (avid Chinatown diner) on the search for good Asian entrees with no luck until now. Had the pork cilantro pancake, beef mei fun noodles (ordered chow fun, still yummy), and Grandma's sweet n' sour chicken. Everything was delicious. The wait was long for dine-in (Friday night), but so worth the homemade noodles. Doing take out next time."}
{"text":"Probably the only good eat-in Chinese restaurant on the west side of Madison (they're actually in Middleton).  In contrast to some reviews, we've always found their service to be friendly and attentive (I think the owner has been there every time we've gone).  While they do have an \"authentic\" menu (in addition to \"Americanized Chinese\"), I think the \"authentic\" menu is still pretty tamed down, especially with respect to spiciness.  That said, my wife and kids are probably less of a fan than I am for the spicy stuff, so this place pretty much fits the bill for everyone.

We've also had no problems with service being slow (and with two kids, that would be an immediate deal-breaker!)"}
{"text":"This place used to be just OK, but that has definitely changed! the prices have gone way up, delivery takes at least an hour (and we're less than a mile away) and their service sucks! Coworkers and I placed an order for delivery, there were 5 of us. We each got the lunch specials which included an egg roll. They included 1 packet of soy sauce, did they expect all 5 of us to share the 1 packet??? One coworker ordered sweet & sour chicken, but no sweet n sour sauce was included. When we called the restaurant, they said \"Oh, well we can give you a discount next time\" so she had to eat her chicken dry. As with our egg rolls, how do you not include sauce for egg rolls??? The dishes were all bland, even the \"spicy\" ones had absolutely no spice to them. We will not be ordering from here again and will be passing the word around!"}
{"text":"Nice lunch menu. Good quality and low prices. Friendly staff.  Large portion sizes. The orange chicken is great."}
{"text":"My friends and I have been going to Taigu for about a year now, and we've never been disappointed! Pretty quick service, easy parking in the area, and good prices and portions.

I really recommend the Grandmas Sweet and Sour Chicken - while it does sound like the most basic 'Americanized' Chinese dish, it's actually pretty delicious. Their eggplant has always been great too! 

If you're in the mood for good Chinese food, I'd definitely hit this place up!"}
{"text":"After having virtually no success in finding really inventive, high quality Chinese food lately in Madison (other than at the occasional kids home birthday party!), I was excited to see Taigu pop up as a relatively new contender in the space.  For all you Imperial Garden and PF Chang fans, if you're really honest with yourself, in the darkest of sleepless nights, do either of these places really warrant the cost and hype?  Thankfully, Taigu comes closest to giving a quality product for good value without trying too hard or promising too much.  The old staples, Sesame Beef and General's Chicken, were meaty and not over breaded or over sauced.  Both dishes could use a few veggies thrown in for good measure but the proteins were on the mark.  The fried dumplings were a really interesting blend of spices, carrots, and pork that felt more like a bao filling but totally worked.  The dipping sauce was meh but thankfully the dumplings held their own.  You can tell that the noodles were house made and house cut and wow, what a difference that makes.  I wouldn't say the other \"house\" ingredients got me all that excited but when you order noodles and they are the star of the dish, you've basically got exactly what you wanted.

Overall, this is a good, new discovery in the Chinese food delivery landscape and I look forward to branching out into other parts of the menu in the very near future."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout on a whim because our usual spot close to our house was closed.  So happy we gave this place a try.  My husband and I kept saying how fresh everything tasted, which is usually not a word I use to describe Chinese food. We tried the Taigu spicy noodles, garlic chicken over broccoli, some fried rice, and the chicken teriyaki appetizer.  We were very impressed with it all.  We will certainly be switching up which Chinese restaurant we order from now on -- worth the extra drive for us!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Food - Lovely People

I've eaten here many times and it is fantastic.  By far the best Chinese in the area and better than I have experienced in Chicago, where we live part time.  As other reviews said - the noodles are extraordinary.  No idea why someone posted they are greasy - couldn't be further from the truth in all our experiences and apparently all the other reviews.  Nothing here we have found to be greasy or loaded with salt - it is the exact opposite.  Clean, authentic and delicious.

And the owner and everyone else is absolutely lovely.  It's a gem for Wisconsin and the midwest generally that thinks chain Chinese is even remotely edible.  Their skill and care shows and it's a delight."}
{"text":"A pleasant find in downtown Middleton. I was craving noodles and hand made noodles are very difficult to find; even more so in Wisconsin.
These are fantastic. I was looking for the dim sum but it got lost in translation; next time ask for pot stickers. I had the Taigu spicy pan fried noodle lunch special. You get the option of a soda or 2 baby egg rolls. I opted for the 2 egg rolls and burned my fingers on them. They were pretty standard with cabbage inside. The noodles were a little bit chewy to the tooth and flavorful. I would have liked them to be a little more spicy. There wasn't enough burn or kick to make me sweat.
Overall, a great lunch spot and I was full half way through my plate... that or I was tired from chewing.
Definitely a great addition to downtown."}
{"text":"Poor service and bad attitude towards babies. Extra charges on spare dishes for sharing food, ridiculous service"}
{"text":"Go here. Eat noodles. 

How haven't I reviewed Taigu yet? I love this place. You must try the hand pulled noodles. I haven't found them anywhere else in Madison. Get the special spicy noodles for your first visit (mix of three meats). 

The dumplings and the soups are also very good, as are some of the stir fries we've tried, but you have to try those noodles first! I think they've been a little more reserved on their spice levels since opening, probably playing to the local palate. The first few times, I had to knock back a lot of water, but I wasn't on fire. Now, I could use more heat (but it's not bland). Extra spicy lovers may want to request it with a little more spice, or ask if they have chilie sauce they can bring to the table.

The servings are large. You're likely to have leftovers, even though you want to keep shoveling the glistening, lucious noodles in your mouth.

I wouldn't recommend the curry noodles. Save your curry order for Thai or Indian restaurants. 

The only reason I gave this four stars instead of five is that service can be inconsistent, even in the same visit. The servers are very nice, but seem easily distracted.  Hence, it's best to go a little before or after the dinner rush."}
{"text":"You cannot come to this place and not try their homemade noodles. I ordered the stir fried noodles, my mother the beef shank noodle soup and my husband the spicy noodles.

I have to say that all dishes were delicious. My noodles were stir fried to perfection and had a lot of flavor, a little bit sweet and little salty. Perfect for stir fry. The chili oil on my husbands noodles were a little bit too spicy for me but he absolutely loved it. Wiped his plate clean. 

The broth on the beef soup had great flavor development and tasted like it was homemade. 

I am really glad to have tried this place and will be coming back soon. The service was very good, the people were very sweet and attentive, and the food was delicious."}
{"text":"Fantastic food! Fantastic service!

Can't go wrong with the hand cut noodle dishes! So happy to see authentic, non-Americanized Chinese, making its way to Madison. 

Scallion Pancake is downright decadent, just make sure to eat it there (haven't had a great delivered pancake from anyone- not made for transit, like anything fried).

Only criticism- when I ask for extremely spicy, please take it there. Though it's a common problem I've encountered at other establishments. Such is life.

Keep it up Taigu!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try Taigu for lunch for a while since I started working relatively nearby. In fact, it's been having me craving Chinese in general, and last night I almost picked up some junk Chinese on my way home from the gym. But I stopped myself and said, no, I will go to Taigu for lunch tomorrow and get rid of this craving! 

In short: it's an informal place with legit noodles. It's not a full-service, \"hello my name is Billy and I'll be your server this evening, may I interest you in our drink menu\" place. The nice lady at the counter greeted me, asked if I'd been there before, and when I said no, recommended the noodles, because \"we're the noodle place.\" 

I went for the noodles with roast pork and shanxi vinegar. You get a can of soda with your noodles. The noodles were great. Good chew, and the seasonings were kinda spicy and not just overwhelmingly salty as can sometimes happen with Chinese food (especially if you're talking more Americanized dishes). 

At 11 bucks it's not the absolute cheapest lunch out there but I want to say some of the other noodles if you forgo the shanxi vinegar and get basic chicken or whatever are more like $8 or $9. 

Overall, I like it, and I will be going back. Just gotta watch my carbs."}
{"text":"Would highly recommend their hand-made fried noodles and green onion pancakes!
Don't forget to ask for their homemade hot sauce."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a home cooking type meal experience without having to cook at home, then Taigu is the place to go. Either to eat in for the fine hand pulled noodles, or take out for one of their other signature dishes. 

The quality of food is much better than other fast Chinese food, however it is also on the pricey end but definitely worth the additional money. The beef hand pulled noodle and broth was quite a large portion that I saved half for lunch the next day. The dumplings also taste better than it looks, especially dipped in the soy sauce.

The ambience as others have noted, is lacking in the sense that the service can be slow, and the one waiter/cashier/busboy is attending to everyone at this small cozy Chinese restaurant. Additionally, the wooden cabin like chairs and tables also feel out of place for the type of cuisine. However if you ever look up at the ceiling, you'll feel the same type of awe as you would biting into the home style cooking. Next time you came by, be sure to take a look at the ceiling to see what I mean."}
{"text":"This place has easily the best takeout Chinese food in Madison. There are two menus: one authentic and one American. If you're checking it out for the first time, try the cat ear noodles; they are divine!"}
{"text":"We dined at Taigu on a Friday night, expecting a long wait for our food like other reviews described, even when the place wasn't busy. There was only one other party seated in the restaurant during our meal, though people filtered in and it to pick up takeout orders. Thankfully, we didn't have any delays. Our meal included an appetizer (pork and Chinese chive dumplings) and noodle dishes (fried knife cut noodles with beef and spicy beef, respectively) and we were out of there within an hour. The food was delicious and unique. The noodles had a great chewiness to them and were served with a nice balance of meat and veggies. All of the staff members we interacted with were exceptionally nice and helpful."}
{"text":"Came today to escape the kids for a nice lunch on our anniversary. I had this place marked due to the great reviews. We came right at 11am when they opened for lunch. Service was very pleasant and timely. The waitress helped explain a menu question. Note that they give you the \"lunch menu\" during lunch hours, but the full menu is available. Just ask. We ordered the dumplings with pork and Chinese scallions. The best I've ever had. The scallion pancake was amazing too. Had to order that as everyone seemed to mention them. Ask for the homemade chili sauce. It was recommended and was a nice accompaniment. I had the stir fry noodles with egg and veggies and my husband had the stir fry noodles with spicy beef and jalapeno. Both were excellent. Everything was fresh and flavorful and the noodles had a great texture. We ordered the dinner size so we could have leftovers. The restaurant was clean. I did not use the restroom so can't say about that. One complaint was the water was served with no ice at room temperature. Blech. That forced me to purchase a soda which I don't really care for. (I did not ask for ice water so that may be an option). Some soft music would be a nice addition. There were 4 other tables of people and it was eerily quiet. Highly recommend and I will return for dine in or have hubs pick up takeout on the way from work. Thanks Taigu!!!"}
{"text":"Was hankering for some Chinese takeout but hadn't taken the plunge in forever due to questionable food from quite a few different spots.  Decided to take a chance on Taigu based on other Yelpers praise, and as usual Yelp was a success.

Ordered the spicy beef knife cut noodles, general tso, and pork egg rolls.  Went to pick it up, nice guy working at the counter and a reasonable open space despite being devoid of decor and atmosphere.  Good location too, right in downtown Middleton with decent parking.

Very generous portions, plenty for a big dinner for both my wife and I with leftovers to boot.  The fresh pulled noodles were fantastic, as was the spicy beef, lots of flavor and noticeably different from your run of the mill packaged stuff.  The general tso was also tasty and not questionable (woohoo we did it!) but did not include broccoli which was a bit of a letdown but at least I know for the future. 

Both my wife and I really liked this one, I'd recommend it if you need your fix and don't want to chance one of the million 2/3 star joints in town.  Absolutely get one of the noodle dishes.  Doesn't break the bank either, $30 for the two of us for all that food"}
{"text":"Came here for Chinese New Year lunch to start the year off with some symbolically representative foods of longevity and wealth.

We ordered beef noodle soup, Taigu spicy noodles, scallion pancake, and dumplings. They also gave us complimentary egg rolls, which tasted meh, but free is free.

As far as taste goes, I wish the broth from the soup had more flavor to it. Aside from that and the egg rolls, everything else tasted pretty standard. I particularly enjoyed their specialty Taigu Stir-Fry noodles, and would order that again."}
{"text":"They told me our food would arrive in 30-40 minutes. It's been 1 hour and 45 minutes and our food has still not arrived. When I called, the third time, to complain they said the GPS got him lost. We only live one mile away. He just arrived as I'm writing this. They did offer me a five dollar credit but I don't know that we'll order from them again. Just finished eating, the good was fine but the only difference between the Orange chicken and the sesame chicken was the sesame seeds. Food was cold, obviously. Spring rolls were soggy because of the wait."}
{"text":"Tried this place on a whim and was so impressed! The food is fresh, doesn't taste too salty or like there are artificial ingredients. Plus, the staff is so friendly and happy! We ordered online for pickup which was super convenient!"}
{"text":"Most Authentic Chinese food I've had in Madison area. A fellow Chinese recommended me to this place. 
Love the silk tofu here. Do try the numbing spice- it's something that makes your tongue numb and feels cold when you have water. Great fun :)"}
{"text":"Brought take-out home on a very cold night. Got great advice from the nice gentleman working the counter. Had the fried dumplings with carrot and loved them. 

We had one beef and one chicken entree and liked them both. Looks like next time I have to come back for noodles."}
{"text":"No idea why I have not tried this place before, but man is it good!  The noodles are so good and you get a HUGE serving. My husband had beef and broccoli and he said \"never thought I would say this, but this broccoli is delicious!\". Their food has lots of flavor, it is hands down the best Chinese I have had in Madison. Try them!"}
