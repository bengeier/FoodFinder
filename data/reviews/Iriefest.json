{"text":"If you're looking for the coolest place in Mississauga in the summer, look no further than Mississauga's Irie Music Festival. Easily the coolest and most chill place to be.   Whether you're there for the culture, the music, the FOOD or the shopping, a day with good weather at iriefest is like a small vacation to the Caribbean that doesn't cost you a flight or a week off of work.   Just think, for under $25, you can have yourself a coconut opened fresh, straw inserted for easy coconut milk drinking, a huge portion of jerk chicken, rice and peas and a couple of beef patties. Crank up the reggae music or soca and I'm basically on vacation.   This was my first year in attendance and without a doubt it won't be my last. The food assortment alone is enough to bring me back.   Everyting Be Irie. At iriefest"}
{"text":"I only dropped by this festival for about 1 hour to check a few things out.  It wasn't too busy when I visited on a Saturday afternoon and it was a bit of a shame because they seem to put on quite a show.    There were plenty of Caribbean food vendors and even a beer garden.  They also seem to have some good bands and pretty decent dancers.  I think next year, I'll try to spend a few more hours to chill. Definitely a good venue and seems like a great time to have with family and friends."}

{"text":"I decided to drop by to check out the Yelp booth on the weekend and check out the action in Celebration Square. It was a great venue with tons of room and plenty of action happening in the square.  Lots to see and Iriefest is a great outlet and expression for the Caribbean culture.    The main stage hosted all the live music and demonstrations. The crowd was happy, energetic and awesome!  The food vendors were my favorite as I got my Caribbean weakness...ROTI...sooo good...There were also some local food trucks there to serve up their wares as well.  The Yelp booth was also great, as it allowed people to chill out on the couches and charge up their phones if they needed it.  Props go out to the YelpGTA interns for awesome service!    Good food, great venue, awesome live music and free!  4 stars"}
