{"text":"I use to go to this place but I stopped going because I have to wait forever for the food, and the taste is nothing to do with the real ecuadorian food. plus is so over priced ."}
{"text":"I have been here many times and their food and service is great. I love their cheese empanadas with a little homemade salsa hot sauce. Their prices are decent compared to other Latin places. For about $12 you get a full meal enough to stuff you."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the better choices in this Latin food court. The quality of the meat and chicken can be questionable sometimes tho. Almost every plate is $10 even"}
{"text":"I enjoy visiting this restaurant in specific when visiting Plaza Latina.  All the food (especially empanadas, humitas, tamales) is delicious but I've found that the fish fillet has reduced in size from what it was before.  It didn't occur to me that they had a lunch and dinner platter until as of recent and found that the 'small' fillet was really half of the large which really wasn't much to begin with.  (You need to see it to believe it and honestly I've been there numerous times and saw better in the past...)  Apparently the person who was responsible for making the tamale de pollo has left or something like that but it makes me wonder if it is out of laziness that these other staff members wont make it or that they don't know how.. Clearly there are ecuadoran women working there but you can't sit at cash and recieve money if your not making product to sell.  This is just to say that I didn't have that great of an experience and hope that I can write a better review when I do in the near future if that happens.  I have somewhat began making the dish at home myself because a basa fish fillet (2 fillets actually) come up to about cheaper (about half the price) than the meal itself.  So I dont understand the chinciness when they do have a chinese market across the street and business was going so well and they have no problem making money so why are they cutting corners and just being plain lazy?"}
