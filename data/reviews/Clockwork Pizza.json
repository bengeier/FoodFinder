{"text":"Got nothing but good things to say. I've tried just about everything from the pizza to the calzones and the wings. Friendly staff, casual and professional. Haven't had a bad experience yet. I mainly eat there during pm hours."}
{"text":"This place is delicious and the staff is great. They deals are affordable and the pizza is good quality. Wait time is average for a standard pizza joint. Also their menu has good variety and their calzones are awesome!"}
{"text":"Wanted to try something new so I rolled the dice& left winning. Ordered pickup via Yelp, in less than 5mins. I paid 20$ for med Clockwork pizza w/ extra ricotta& Greek salad. Knocked my socks& shoes off. Quality pizza@ good prices, very helpful staff. I will I'll def be back."}
{"text":"Clockwork has some of the best wings I have ever had,  big wings and delicious hot sauce on them as well. The pizza is great to, only thing is the crust is bit crunchy, the cheese and sauce make up for it cause they're are bomb. Havent had everything else on the menu cause I love the wings and pizza to much. Definitely recommend this place if you want some beast wings."}
{"text":"Fast delivery. All our food arrived fresh and hot. the white pizza was some of the best my moms had. 10/10 on her scale. the garlic knots were large enough for an appetizer for the 3 of us. the BBQ chicken wings were crispy and slathered with thick sauce. They are definitely worth it. the meatball sub was very good too. we were really impressed and have a new favorite delivery restaurant!"}
{"text":"I ordered the one topping pizza and it was amazing! I love cheese & it had just the right amount of cheese and pepperoni on it! The delivery was super fast!"}
{"text":"Had pizza delivered once in the past, was amazing! Just ordered again with a couple special requests, hoping they are consistent!  Having cheese bread for the first time, if the pizza is as good as last time, will try garlic knots next."}
{"text":"Love love LOVE this place! The owner is always there, the staff is super friendly and the food is delish! We've been going there since they opened and are never disappointed! The owner is very personable and he even hooked me up with a free slice of cheesecake on my birthday."}
{"text":"The best pizza on planet earth! I especially love white pizza and theirs has great flavor. Mmmm - add garlic sauce and it is decadent! I also ordered boneless chicken wings which were marvelous too. Ordering is so easy online and they are very timely and courteous. I won't order pizza from anyone else! Try this restaurant and you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Wings were good, could have more sauce though. Pizza was bad, pretty much eating cardboard. Do not recommend at all."}
{"text":"Pizza and food is good. Much better than last experience. Glad management reached out and we gave this place a second shot."}
{"text":"Great pizza! Good wings! Ordering through the Yelp app was easy and the pizza was at our door in 30 minutes and was still piping hot! Great experience! Will definitely order from them again!"}
{"text":"This place is terrible. Took an hour and a half to deliver a pizza and wings.When it finally came it was cold undercooked. The wings looked like they where leftovers. Driver didn't say anything about how long it took no \"sorry\" nothing."}
{"text":"I love the theme of this place other than the fact that it is not 24/7, I think the clock stops at like 11 pm here. The Buffalo Chicken and Godfather Clock are a different story though, my household tends to accumulate clockwork boxes once in a while especially during sporting events. We even had the \"time out\" lets call clockwork laugh and proceeded to order over $100 of Alarm Clocks and Mousse Cakes... this is the best hidden gem in Tempe for doorstep pizza days."}
{"text":"We have often had Clockwork Pizza deliver casual food in a pinch.  They are fast, reliable and when we order online, seem nearly always to get the details right, (no onions, extra mayo, etc.). Have enjoyed subs, gyros, salads, desserts, and fries or chips visiting kids numerous times.  They have us covered for snacks, (Oreos, snickers, monster, Gatorade) we don't keep around the house, when there are hungry kids over with friends. Great customer service, and very good subs ( Italian, ham and turkey are favorites) and other items above.  As they are our go-to delivery for very casual food, it must be said that with their strengths, we have learned over several tries to entirely skip the wings, surprisingly even the kids, (just too much vinegar, too little flavor), and the pizza.  The small pizzas are consistently sodden. Medium thick dough, undercooked every time, are just a mess, and they go uneaten.  Requested well done, and then thinner and well done but had the same undercooked really awful result.  The dough just doesnt get cooked.  It's just bad.  We don't think of them as a pizza place, but do think of them as terrific for good delivery, sandwiches salads snacks desserts.  Kids love the brownie, friends like chocolate mousse cake, the very light if untraditional Tiramisu is a favorite."}
{"text":"I have been ordering from clockwork for about a year. It started w a general gyro craving and oh my they do have amazing gyros right here!. Very small place w hard working people. We usually get it delivered and they are fast, fair priced and you can usually get alot of fun things. The calzones and pizza are really great too. They have good coupons as well. Ordering through grubhub can be beneficial for coupons at this place. They are really great ."}
{"text":"Clockwork Pizza did a fundraiser for our high school football team.  They were great helping us raise funds, pizza is good, affordable, and staff friendly."}
{"text":"Wings were amazing.pizza amazing... Overall a great place .When ever I am in Tempe we stop in"}
{"text":"This business has changed hands and not for the better. This is the first time ever that I have not been able to eat a pizza. I ordered the wings and pizza special. The wings were dark brown as if the oil has not been changed for a long time. The pizza I ordered was a sausage pepperoni. This if the first time I ever saw black shriveled up sausage. Don't waste your money or your time."}
{"text":"ordered from doordash. wayyyy better than pizza hut and dominos.. i will definitely be ordering from here from now on. pizza and crust was perfect and fresh. also, i got the 10 piece mild wings w/ranch, also tasty!!"}
{"text":"The food and the driver were both completely amazing! Whoever made that pizza deserves a raise"}
{"text":"We love Clockwork Pizza! This is not gourmet pizza but it is pretty good for delivery. They have great prices and great toppings! Very friendly too."}
{"text":"The only pizza I've eaten prior to this regularly  is nasty chain pizza so keep that in mind when I say this is the best pizza I've ever had thus far. I'm not quite sure what to name the style other than f'in amazing. Having alot of cheese on it, I expected it to be rather greasy but surprisingly it wasn't really greasy at all. While the pepperonis were a little greasy, it's definitely acceptable when they appear to be really fresh (you'll notice the deep red color too). You'd really just have to try it yourself because it's so much more different than what's readily available out here.   The wings too, my god, are amazing as well. Even though a place like buffalo wild wings is known simply for their wings, they can't compare with Clockwork's meaty and well sauced wings. Whatever fat is on the wing is minimal and doesn't impede the enjoyment at all. There's just enough sauce to be able to dip your wing in the little puddles in the box. Only downside: just one ranch per 10 wings. Then again, I had no problem enjoying the wings by themselves.  Food aside, the employees (which I think are all family, or at least closely connected) are all very nice. When waiting outside for my pizza, one of the employees brought my food out to me and wished me a good night.   The environment is very nice for what appears to be a low-traffic strip mall. LCD TV on the wall for the table inside and a few tables outside. Clean and neat sums it up well.   The taste alone has kept me coming back since I started with them just a week ago thanks to an ad on my door (who would have thought that stuff worked ha), but the prices slaughter the chain pizza shops, especially once you factor in quality of food."}
{"text":"This pizza beats even Venezia's, in fact we've switched to Clockwork because their pizza is just as good, AND it is cheaper, AND their delivery is faster.  Their crust is light and crispy (doesn't go soggy while they drive it to your door!) Plus, the prices are decent and the delivery is fast.  I have never eaten in the restaurant so I can't comment there.  Garlic knots are amazing! Pizza is fresh and delicious.  Their crust is just how I prefer it and the sauce is tangy. Cheesy bread (we've tried the tomato cheese and the Jalapeno cheese) are heavenly. Salads are fresh and crispy and they keep the salad separate from the warm items so it doesn't go limp.  I LOVE this extra precaution. The clock theme they have for the pizza names is pretty creative (Godfather, Alarm, etc.)  The website is easy to use to place your order, and the delivery guys have all been super friendly and efficient.  If you're tired of chain pizza, don't want to pay the premium price for Venezia's, or just want to try something new in the area, I highly recommend them.  The ONLY criticism I have is the first time we ordered from them, I asked for ranch and the ranch tasted like that Kraft stuff.  Kind of gross.  The last time we ordered, though, they gave us ranch even though we didn't order it, and it tasted like the homemade stuff you expect from a pizza place, so I did not remove a star.  Ranch is important to me.  Give them a try!"}
{"text":"Ordered on line using the Eat24 app surprised again good food and the gyro had way more meat then expected. Fries were cooked crispy as I ordered them. I will definitely order from them again."}
{"text":"Clockwork is what it is, a great pizza place merely because of the good value, good pizza and good wings. That alone makes it great. They accept competitor's coupons as well. Open Late, so that helps."}
{"text":"Clockwork is just an average pizza joint.  I'm a big fan of crusts, and Clockwork's crust is probably the blandest of the bland.  Tastes like water and flour.  As far as the ingredients, I've had three of their pizzas.  Simply pepperoni, a Green Pepper, Onion, and Sausage, and their BBQ Chicken pizza.   Firstly, the pepperoni.  As far as their sauce and cheese, it was more or less on the bland side, but the pepperoni was nice and crisp on the edges.  It's kind of hard to screw up a pepperoni.  So the pepperoni wasn't so bad. Next, the sausage, onion, and green pepper.  My take on their sausage; buy something else.  It's awful rubbery cheap little globules.  If I had a recommendation for the owner;  get like the progressive privately owned pizza places in the valley and buy from the Schreiner's.   Otherwise, if you're not buying quality you're wasting your customers time.   In terms of the BBQ chicken pizza, I definitely stress the quality of cooking this correctly, because Clockwork isn't.  First, I don't know if it was because of the cook that night or what, but the dough was not done, pretty much ruining the whole thing.  The BBQ was too sweet, and the chicken to top it off was cheap and had lots of cartiledge.    I think that if Clockwork started buying more quality ingredients they would be a better than average joint, but there are numerous factors holding them back."}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite delivery pizza joint! I get the cheese pizza with mushrooms and pineapple and I love it! My daughter really enjoys the Buffalo Chicken sandwich, and their Gyros are very good.  We order from Clockwork at least once a week.  We enjoy the food, they are fast and friendly and have never messed up an order."}
{"text":"Delicious food and good delivery. Ordered from them 4 times in the last month and each time has been a positive experience. Pizza and calzones are very delicious. Highly recommended. Beats places like domino's or pizza Hut any day."}
{"text":"Been ordering from Clockwork Pizza years! Delivery is always on point and have a huge menu."}
{"text":"We order from this place periodically and the food is always good!  The Greek Explosion Pita is amazing and I get it every time.  We also like getting the pizza.  Will continue to go here regularly!"}
{"text":"This is the best pizza I have had in years! It was inexpensive, delicious, and arrived in only 20 minutes! Ordered the Godfather Clock Pizza and a Greek salad."}
{"text":"Love the pizza and love the wings. They always cook the wings as we request them, \"extra crispy\". Delivery is always on time."}
{"text":"I will fully admit the food was great. I had never been there before - it was my first time. The experience I had when I called back to ask a question about my bill was NOT. I asked to speak to a manager. 1st off, the \"manager\" told me I should have noticed the bill was oddly high when I ordered. Not the way for her to handle it in my opinion. I would have left it at that but then the girl was rude & to hang up with me said, \"I'm busy, bye\". Ten minutes later I called back and asked to speak to the manager, again. The girl hung up on me almost immediately. The third time I called and asked for the manager -the \"manager\" was now a man. He accused me of being racist (15+ times) without knowing my race. He refused to tell me the owner's name or corporate number. I finally found out who the owner was by looking up the business license through the state of Arizona's public records. I went in to the restaurant to speak to him about the incident. He started coming up with excuses for their behavior. He said she was under a lot of stress. As for the man, he admitted it was his brother, and I quote, he said, \"my brother, he's a little crazy\". His brother was upset because they were busy and I was calling in. The owner also told me I should have called back later and not that night when I noticed the bill was wrong. Eventually, he admitted that the woman was his wife. Then, he said the reason she was short with me was that their 7 month old who was behind the counter in the area with the ovens had just hit her head. Therefore, she had to go check on the baby. My response to all of this was that it could have been handled differently. She could have said there is an emergency I need to go. His brother could have apologized for her and tried to help me himself. Then I said all I would like them to do is apologize for being rude to me when I called in with a question, not demanding a refund or trying to be rude. I still wasn't looking for a refund or free pizza. I, as a costumer, wanted to be treated with respect when I speak to employees. He took down my name and number and said he would have them call to apologize. That was last week. I have not received an apology or heard from them since. I am shocked that a small, local business, whom I was trying to help support, would treat a customer like this. Thank you for your time."}
{"text":"The best pizza place to eat from in Phoenix! They also serve halal which is why we came here and love the pizza crust and toppings Not even Pizza Hut or dominos can beat the taste this place can offer. We eat from here at least once a week P.s. Try jalapeño topping it taste great with spicy touch"}
{"text":"Delivery was abysmally long. Over the 30 minutes that was quoted. I called and no one answered. Delivery driver did not apologize. For a pizza place that has clock in it's name they don't really give a crap about your time."}
{"text":"I love this place from the really good pizza and wings to the customer service. This has been my best kept secret for over a year. It was hard to fine a place that use pork products in their meats. All clean meats yeah buddy!!"}
{"text":"There pizza is really good, I love their buffalo and BBQ chicken Pizza's. I'm heard that their sandwiches are pretty good, so I plan on trying that next time. The only thing is that they only have halal grilled chicken and nothing else is halal,  so hopefully they'll be adding some more halal options and I think they should be open 24 hours. The owner and employees are really nice too."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place on a whim, once with delivery and once for pickup.  Delivery order (made online) around 11/20:  2 large pizzas (1 cheese, 1 bbq chicken with onion) 1 order of garlic knots.  Order was delivered within 30 minutes of ordering, delivery driver was courteous. Order was 100% correct and the pizzas were cooked perfectly.  Pick-Up Order (ordered online 12/7):  2 large pizzas (1 cheese, 1 pepperoni) 1 order of cheese bread  The store front is a little small, but the staff are so kind and it smells AMAZING in there!! They were extremely busy and still found time to give us a warm welcoming. Order was 100% correct and waiting for us when we arrived, pizza was perfect.  Conclusion: This pizza is amazing and the cheese bread and garlic knots to die for!!! The price can't be beaten, and with the right search tools you can find coupons online! Why waste money at those chain restaurants when you can have handmade deliciousness! I will never get my pizza anywhere else but here again!"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza and awesome food .  I've eaten there many times. They are close by to my office so we order them in frequently."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza! Good crust, tasty sauce, lots of cheese, not skimpy on the toppings. Rare to find salad delivery, they make them to order so its fresh- no wet cheese, soggy veg or limp lettuce. They even have fries for my oldest who strangely doesn't like pizza -weird.  We have ordered from them multiple times, delivery is quick and friendly. Orders are correct -one time they forgot my salad, which I was craving, but credited the amount back. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"If you want a spiritual experience with your food. Order the garlic knots.  ORDER THE GARLIC KNOTS. I can tell these people work with care and love and magic because those knots are honestly the single greatest thing in phx."}
{"text":"Poor quality. Ordered meat lovers' pizza and BBQ chicken wings. Took 40+ minutes and the crust was soggy and the chicken wings weren't even juicy. Definitely wouldn't order from here again."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Great food, great value, super fast and always accurate. It's the reason my ass is so fat. For that reason it's a love/hate relationship."}
{"text":"I just moved to the area and was looking for a pizza delivery nearby and decided to try this place. I ordered a pizza and garlic knots which were both really good. The delivery was quick and the price very reasonable, I'll definitely be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"Pretty good delivery pizza.  I like that you can order and pay online (and tip online too).  It makes it so much easier!"}
{"text":"My girl friend and I have been eating here for years. Best pizza you can get in the area. The sandwiches and fries are great as well. The service is always friendly in the store, and the drivers are just as nice. Everything is well priced and delicious!"}
{"text":"I've ordered from here about 6 times, and I love it! The gyro pizza is so yummy, oh and the garlic knots too! We usually do pick up and the customer service is great as well. I'll keep going here for sure! I have only one small complaint, I like dill but there is way too much in the taziki sauce."}
{"text":"I tried Clockworks Pizza a few weeks ago. The service was good, and the place was very clean. Not a lot room for people looking to dine in. The mistake I made was that I ordered a Gyro from a pizza place. The tzatziki sauce and pita was good, but the meat was extremely hot. I had to wait a good 10 minutes for it to cool off. The meat was a little rubbery and the edges of the gyro meat was a little hard. Probably heated it in the pizza oven?  Anyway, not the worst ever. I would try it again, only Pizza next time."}
{"text":"Pizza was good but it's definitely on the pricier side and I don't think it was worth as much as we spent. Their online prices are not updated so that was an extreme bummer when we found out the prices had gone up a significant amount after we ordered. The guy who answered the phone was messing around with his co-worker (I'm assuming) so he kept saying \"huh?\" Or \"what was that again?\" Garlic knots were really good. All in all I probably wouldn't order here again unless I was craving the garlic knots and wiling to spend some extra $."}
{"text":"Crust was dry, sauce was bland, wings were burned. Not NY style as advertised. Delivery was fast, that is the only compliment I have.  I won't be ordering from there again."}
{"text":"Woohoo! As good as it gets! That is totally true! Their pizza is awesome and so is their customer service. We have never had a bad meal here. We always have special requests and no one ever groans or acts like we are a pain. Orders are always right-food is yummers. Their pizza is great but so are their sandwiches. Their salads are always made fresh. Hubby loves the chicken parmesan-says it is as good as the fancy places serve but it is half the price here. We have lots of pizza places near us but this is the best! Five stars and more...and the best part is they are open late every night for those late night cravings!"}
{"text":"Clockwork Pizza was a delicious experience for us! For starters, the garlic knots were wonderful."}
{"text":"I have been looking for my go-to pizza place for a while, and I think I've found it! The pizza is excellent, but their wings are questionable. Service for grub hub is amazing even though I live 10 minutes away. Atmosphere in the restaurant isn't perfect, but come on, who's actually going to eat at a pizza delivery place! I strongly recommend this place for Anyone that loves pizza. To add even more greatness, the place is halal! All around great restaurant!"}
{"text":"This is just really awful pizza. I ordered this because of the yelp ratings, but me and three other friends did not enjoy the pizza at all. We also got wings as well, and they were not very good either. I would not eat here again."}
{"text":"My husband is definitely a pizza guy, he could eat pizza for breakfast, lunch and dinner if I would let him. That being said, when we moved to this area of tempe we needed to find a new pizza place.   Clockwork has great pizza, great service, and all around great food! They cook their pizza with some type of garlic in their sauce or something so garlic lovers, you will love this place. And try a gyro if you want something other than pizza. All around great place and the guys that work there are super nice and service is always quick. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Overall, good food that I'll eat again.  Pizza a little soggy to me, but all the flavors were good, crust was good, and toppings were generous.  Delivery was fast, the folks were super nice, the salad was good, breadsticks were good, and so was the chocolate pie.  No complaints - it's fairly inexpensive and not gourmet, but it's not professing to be - it's solid comfort barfood type of fare, so get your order delivered, grab some beers from the fridge, and enjoy a movie!"}
{"text":"I tell all my friends this is a hidden gem of Tempe! You can get a great lunch special here and it doesn't break the bank. I love the family owned business and how in the afternoons you see their kids in there doing homework. The owners are so friendly and always say hello when I come in. Most times that hello turns into a great conversation about business. I couldn't be more happy with the food they serve and the atmosphere that comes with such a great little place. Give it a shot and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Oh Yes! Original owner, Rami is back! Delivery times are faster, quality food, and great service ! Chicken and sausage are halal. I love the chicken here . It's my favorite pizza place!"}
{"text":"So much yum! I've been looking for a good pizza place that isn't super expensive but not one of the common chains. Ordered from here twice now and I haven't been disappointed yet! Flavor is really awesome!"}
{"text":"I love this place, moved from the area and had to stop in and make the family happen with pizza from clockwork! So glad and proud to see a non food chain doing well, I think it's probably due to great customer service and damn good food! I miss living close to this place! I"}
{"text":"Pizza's pretty good. The service is great. They were really helpful even when I forgot my wallet (yes I still had to pay of course)."}
{"text":"Great pizza! I'm not proud of this, but my husband and I went ham on their large clockwork pizza and ate all of it between the two of us. That's how good it was. It's not fancy or gourmet but it hits the spot and the price is very fair. Will definitely make this our regular pizza spot."}
{"text":"Edit: 9/17 :I don't know what happened but the recipe doesn't seem the same. Not really diggin' it so much  -(So love this place for the pizza and service. I get 2 slices lunch special. Best price, best pizza in the area!)"}
{"text":"Really decent pizza, and even more delicious Greek salads. Very consistently good take out. The XL size is quite large and everything looked fresh."}
{"text":"Don't know why it took me so long to give this place a try, perhaps because the name \"Clockwork\"doesn't conjure up 'Italian\" or even \"Pizza\" for that matter. My favorite food is the basic cheese pizza and I haven't found anything in the Phoenix area to get excited about (have been sampling for 7 yrs now). Lo and behold right down the street is finally something I'm excited about. Just a good  tasty cheese pizza at a reasonable price!"}
{"text":"Holy, delicious!! Clockwork is better than the chains, and just as cheap.  Plus, they offer a wide selection of salads, gyros, sandwiches and pizzas.  My one true love is the Pendulum Clock White Pizza with ricotta cheese, mozzarella, fresh garlic, tomato and spinach.    Feel like eating pizza on Easter or Xmas?  I did.  And they were open."}
{"text":"I'm am VERY picky with my pizza. It has to have the right flavor and I really don't like it when there's way more sauce than cheese. I can definitely say that this pizza was amazing, totally recommend it!"}
{"text":"I'm giving 4 stars because the delivery driver was very polite and the hot gyro pita was the bomb!!  Pizza was average, Little Caesar's $5 is better in my opinion.  But, LC doesn't deliver.  I did not like the wings.  They had no crispiness and I like wings a little crispy.  The bread-sticks were decent but again, LC has a better bread stick.  I would recommend the sandwiches here.  They are better than the pizzas!"}
{"text":"Great little gem in south Tempe. Ordered a pepperoni pizza and wings for lunch. Placed the order online at 10:40 with a scheduled delivery time. The driver arrived at the exact time we requested. Pizza and wings where awesome. Will be ordering again soon!"}
{"text":"Costumer lost!!!!!!!! Waited over an hour for my pizza and then it's delivered COLD !!!!!! And your delivery driver is lost at the wheel and huffy. Never ordering again!!! Ever!!!!  I called to tell them I was dissatisfied and I get an attitude .... This was my favorite place .... Never ordering again!!!   $25 for cold pizza .... no thanks!!!!!   This New Yorker lives on principle ...."}
{"text":"OMFG THEY CHANGED THE CHEESE! I order pizza from here any chance I get and the last two times I notice it tasted different. I figured it out, it's the CHEESE and it was always good now it is freaking AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Just average in my opinion but I would not repeat to be sincere."}
{"text":"I was traveling and looked up pizza this was the closet one to me and the other reviews seemed to he exciting and they had almost 5 stars. I really don't get it. They have only one seat inside and three little dirty seats outside. I was traveling with two children and this place wouldn't even let them use the restroom. I guess I should have read a few more reviews before I decided upon this pizza joint. The menu is way different than the one they show on line and the food is not at all what I expected. Well better luck next time. Hope your experience is more exciting than mine."}
{"text":"What to say... Clockwork's food is SO good.  The Pizza is probably my current favorite NY style.  This is no joke... it's very good Pizza and the people are pretty great.  Now, what really sets this apart are the wings.  The wings are my favorite hands down.  I normally like hot or BBQ, but plain here is hard to pass up.  Flavorful and crunchy without being over done.  Juicy inside!"}
{"text":"The pizza was pretty close to NY style.  I am a pizza snob so I am very picky about my pizza.  I am happy to have found this place.  Now, this place is very small so done in is very limited.  They have one table and a bar shelf for 3.  We ordered 2 kinds of pizza and bone in wings.    They brought us boneless wings by accident.  It was ok and my family and I was ok to eat them but they were quick to correct the order and brought us the right wings at no charge.  The service was tight and on point.  We will order from them again for sure.  Oh yeah... the brownie.. I saw previous reviews that said the brownie was rock hard...well that is because it was cold.  The refrigerate them so they stay fresh.  By the end of our meal the brownie was warmer, softer and chewy.  So yummy!"}
{"text":"I LOVE YOU CLOCKWORK! WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ALL MY LIFE?!  I have to contain my self because it has been so long since I have actually enjoyed and appreciated take out food. I'm not even a big Gyro fan, but I vow I will try everything on this menu. I just wanted some boneless wings (they have 10 for $6) and found them on YELP. Delish, btw. Just for s&g's I decided to try the Greek Explosion Chicken sandwich w/ gyro meat. You can get these cushy, delicious bites of freakin' Heaven on a pita, wrap, and/or a sub roll. OH MY LORD. I got it in the most absolutely, delicious pita wrap. It's so good, I wanted to propose. I might, but I haven't had the pizza yet, which is bound to seal the deal. Anyhow, I can't overstate it. This is just some of the best comfort food I've ever had. It's in a little shopping center at Rural and Elliot and I feel like I'm kind doing a it a diservce by letting everyone in on the secret. But they deserve it, Stay true, Clockwork! You are the most delicious thing I have met in a long time and will be devoting some serious dream time to that Godfather Pizza. I'm coming for YOU."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza, salad & wings for my staff to enjoy during training.  Price was on point, food arrived On-Time & it was delicious!  I'll be using this spot again soon for last minute lunch meetings =)"}
{"text":"I ordered pizza for my students for the end of the year party A DAY before. AND paid for it. Not only did they lose my order they didn't refund me. My students were so disappointed. We had to wait for our pizza which really gave us no time to eat. How disappointing this place is!"}
{"text":"I just moved to the area 3 days ago, I have now eaten at Clockwork twice. The first time I had their slice, salad & drink special for $5. Tonight I ordered a large calzone. First let me start by saying, I am from Chicago, so I would consider myself a pizza aficionado. Their pizza was the best I have had in the 4 years I have been in AZ, hands down. It's a thin crust, sliced NY style.  The \"side\" salad is a nice size with a generous amount of toppings. Every bite was more than just lettuce.  Tonight I had the large deluxe calzone for $10, it's a monsterous size and enough for 3 meals. They slice it into strips so you can eat it without utensils. (Which was nice for me since I have no idea what box my silverware is in!) It was also extremely delicious.  Overall, the food is outstanding and the portion sizes are generous, great value for the money. I will be eating there alot!!"}
{"text":"I order from Clockwork regularly and enjoy their pizza and wings a lot. Tonight, I ordered wings and a salad, and the wings, which were supposed to be mild, were much spicier than usual. I called the store and they immediately offered to send out another order of wings which were delivered about 15 minutes later. Thanks, Clockwork, for both great food AND great customer service!"}
{"text":"After 6 years of living down the street we just found this place.  Ordered last week for the first time and I was impressed!  The sausage wasn't really my style but the cheese pizza was delicious!  We'll definitely be ordering from here more often in the future.  Prices were pretty good too!  Looking forward to trying the garlic knots!"}
{"text":"Clockwork has been our favorite local pizza for a long time. It change ownership briefly and really struggled-I hadn't gone in months. But today I thought I would give it another try, and much to my surprise the original owner was back and working his magic!!!! Thank you Rami!"}
{"text":"I love this place in Tempe. I used to b order from them every week before I moved back to Omaha. Loved everything I ever got there and haven't found anything to compare. Loved the Clockwork Pizza, spicy chicken wrap and the wings. Can't beat the service."}
{"text":"Order just arrived. 10 minutes early great!! Pizza tasted delicious, but under remarks, i asked for peppers on the side. Instead they threw in pizza. Worst problem , wings i noted extra crispy, i like to make sure chicken cooked for kids. Well not cooked enough, and came with hot flavoring. So kids are eating. Had to go to mc donalds to get them dinner instead.   Usually things are great , but 43.00 later not good"}
{"text":"Order for delivery to work.  First time trying this pizza. it was delivered nice and hot, and in a short amount of time.  I really liked that it was thin crust with enough of an edge for dipping in ranch! Will order again!"}
{"text":"Terrible pizza.....ordered it to go and it stunk up my car.....strong smell of yeast......just really nasty stuff, really bready doughy crust even after I asked it \"well done\"....am going to throw the rest of this crap out for the birds to eat...if they will?  No toppings for the birds - this place cheated me on those too.....don't go there!"}
{"text":"I really wanted New York Style Pizza without having to leave my house and this place came through. I like the flat, greasy pizza so it was amazing. Only con is the delivery driver was almost 15 minutes late. The Greek salad was decent."}
{"text":"I   ordered from this place and it came right on time. The pizza was cooked just right. I wish there was a bit more of the topping I  ordered pepperoni and pineapple that is what I like. Next time I guess I will ask for double the amount and see if that is more to my liking as the crust was cooked prefect, loved the sauce and cheese.  Only giving a three because topping seemed to be lite. Over all good teast."}
{"text":"All around was the tastiest yet. Great job guys. I've tried other places your the best so far"}
{"text":"First order from Amazon and I can say I'm pretty happy with the results. Food was delicious. Timing on point.  Price not too shabby. Would I order from here again?  Heck yes I would! Do I recommend you try it out? Of course I do."}
{"text":"You can't beat two giant slices and a drink for $5 or a slice, 6 wings and a drink for $6. The crust is very thin and true to its NY style. The hot wings had great flavor but were a bit small and the quality of meat wasn't as great as some other spots. The garlic knots were delicious and cheesy. I would say the only downside is that it isn't a wonderful spot to sit and enjoy pizza. They do have a few tables inside and out but it is a pick up/delivery style place."}
{"text":"Wonderful neighborhood pizza joint, they are quick to deliver and offer the often sought after Gyro pizza topping."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza for an office lunch. It was a huge hit! Awesome crust and sauce, plus it was ready on time and hot - I got lots of compliments. Will do again and happy to find!"}
{"text":"Clockwork's pizza isn't our favorite, but it will do when we want it fast and pizza isn't our main objective.  The wings are truly the best in the area, gyros are great, greek salad is phenomenal, the buffalo chicken sub and garlic knots take me back to my east coast college days.  Delivery is fast and order is always right."}
{"text":"Love this place. Clear order taking, great customer service, and quick delivery. The food is way better than any pizza places around this area"}
{"text":"I've been ordering from clockworks pizza for at least two years now on our family cheat day.. we usually order the whole wheat pizza, sometimes the kids don't want the whole wheat so we get them a small regular crust cheese pizza. I've never complained and usually ask for lightly baked.. but if we don't they always burn the pizza and then the kids won't eat it and that's money and food to the trash you shouldn't have to ask for your pizza to be lightly baked to be able to eat it!!! It even smells burnt!! Very bad"}
{"text":"Clockworks is a great family owned pizza place that is right around the corner from our house.  We love it.  We order it almost once a week and the owner is so friendly and knows us by name now.  For hot sandwiches, we love the gyro and the buffalo chicken sandwich.  The pizzas are really good too.  We like the buffalo chicken and the BBQ pizza.  Really great staff.  We are moving further from Clockworks, but we will still make the drive or have it delivered.  We have really enjoyed the food and the people for the last 3 years!"}
{"text":"I would say the pizza is consistently good and out of the 10-20 times I have ordered I would say its tasty 90% of the time with the occasional mediocre pizza. I am from NY so yeah I know pizza and its tough to find good pizza here and its always laughable when someone here offers a suggestion such as Papa Johns. I feel bad for all the people who have never had a great slice of NY pizza. :-("}
{"text":"Got a flyer for $21.99 - 20 wings, 16\" 2 topping pizza, so we decided to try them.  Wings are perfect, not greasy, not too much sauce. (We ordered traditional mild) Ordered a gyro (a little too much meat but that's NOT a bad thing!) and two orders of fries. Good fries, good gyro, helpful and quick over the phone and our food came in about 30 minutes. Overall very satisfied with their product and service."}
{"text":"So this is what happens when i am flying on a plane from the west coast to the east coast. I write reviews on different restaurants i have been to.  So first thing first, i have been there about 5 or 6 times and every time they are very friendly and always cut down the price because they always have some kind of deals going on. I remember about 3 months ago i ordered 4 large pizzas and the lady who took my order gave me the best deal for only 34 bucks. I mean come on dude you are getting HALAL chicken pizza in Tempe for so cheap.  So all jokes aside i would recommend the pizza to anyone because they are pretty good. I mean i can understand that once in a while they might have a faulty product but every time i have ordered they have been good."}
{"text":"Super quick delivery from GrubHub (got here 20 minutes before the suggested time) , great size  personal pizza and not skimpy on toppings. Garlic knots were amazing."}
{"text":"Best take out or delivery pizza in the area! You absolutely need to try their cheese bread. It's my favorite cheese bread I've ever had.   I always get the white pizza which is very good and has ricotta cheese on it so the texture is really creamy. I always add chicken too it since it comes meatless. The toppings are always very fresh.   Whenever I have the pizza delivered, they come quickly and the delivery staff has always been very friendly. Every time I order Clockwork I mean to take a picture but then I eat it so quickly because it's so darn that I don't get around to it."}
{"text":"First time ordering a pizza from this spot using the new app \"Slice\".  The pizza was awesome. Very good flavor and the ingredients seem top notch. I ordered a pepperoni, sausage, mushroom, and onion. The crust is not super thin, but it's not deep dish. They say that it's \"New York Hand Tossed Pizza\".  Whatever you call it, it was really good pizza.  When I order again, I will likely ask to have the pizza cooked a little longer as I like my crust a little crispier - but again - what I got this go round was excellent.  One thing to note, in order to complete the order you have to spend at least $15. This was not a big deal for me as I realize this is not Dominos. Thank goodness."}
{"text":"Had the meatlovers pizza with wings and FREE brownie for Yelping! It is good cheap food but really greasy and salty. Wings were ok, a little small for my taste though"}
{"text":"My new favorite pizza place! Delicious pizza!!!! The people at the location were very nice, as well."}
{"text":"Fast delivery but average pizza and bread sticks. Would be better if crust was crispy and not soggy."}
{"text":"Affordable and delicious food and speedy delivery (and we ordered on a Friday night)! I highly recommend the gyro pita and fries, the pendulum white pizza, bone-in (traditional) wings, and the chicken deluxe wrap. You can't go wrong with these guys. They've become our Friday night go-to."}
{"text":"CALZONIE!! I love clock work pizza! me and my co-worker have Fri-zone day where we eat a calzone every fri. A large calzone for $9 feeds us both and we are more than stuffed and normally have a piece or two to give out.   Word of advice ask for extra butter and garlic on top and it will be perfect!  top it off with a piece of chocolate moose cake  wham bam perfect combo for an amazing Friday lunch"}
{"text":"Worst white pizza I've had in my life this was the driest piece of leather pizza I've ever had. I should have stuck with my usual place"}
{"text":"The manager, Rami, reached out to me and was very apologetic and offered to refund our meal and provide a future credit. I have ordered from them for years and have had no problems before this. Consistently, they have had good food, prices, and fast delivery. I will order from them again."}
{"text":"Place and wings have gotten a lot better since my first order. Easy on line ordering food is good and consistent in which is my number 1 reason I continue to order from this place. Love  the salads, fries, and all the extra options :)"}
{"text":"We love Clockwork!  We've been having pizza delivered at least a couple of times a month since they opened.  We don't live far--maybe that's why the pizza and wings are ALWAYS hot when they arrive.  We love (and tip) every driver."}
{"text":"Just changed ownership.  I am a long time customer.  The pizza that we got there today had far less toppings and the crust tasted like cardboard.  Quality has declined and I will need to find another place for pizza."}
{"text":"Yelp is making me write a review that's much longer than I deem necessary, because the words I want to say are simple and meaningful.   Thank you for delivering me cheesy pizza goodness in a timely manner every time I call upon your services. I love you guys."}
{"text":"This is my second time ordering with Clockwork Pizza and I've been very pleased with the place. The person answering the phone is always courteous and friendly and they have your address on file if you have ordered with them in the past - they know it right away by your phone number when you call.   They actually took my order 20 minutes before they close which is awesome for a pizza place; most places deny you if you do not order within 45 minutes of closing time. At least that has been my experiences with other pizza joints in my neighborhood including Gus' Pizza.   The pizza itself is great and the dough and toppings are fresh. Their prices are reasonable to and the pizza is better than something you would get from a dominoes or Papa John's.   Their delivery time is also pretty fast.   This is definitely my go to pizza place."}
{"text":"Consistently delicious, good value, and quick service. Counter staff is very nice, and they get the order right. Clockwork is our go-to for pizza night, well above the quality of Papa/Dominos and with interesting flavors including white pizza with scrumptious ricotta, spinach, garlic and so on. Order online with Slice and a small discount is available. Wings are above board too."}
{"text":"Very good pizza! The garlic knots were fantastic as well. We ate outside as well. The service was great as well. All around 5 stars."}
{"text":"Great pizza! The crust is perfectly crispy and has great flavor.  The employees are very friendly and service was quick.  I ordered online and it was ready by the time I drove over to pick it  up.  I look forward to trying more items on the menu!"}
{"text":"The best thin crust pizza i have ever had. It's really great. Just eat it. I'm not even kidding. Go now and awaken yourself to what eating really is."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza spot! Awesome prices and fast delivery. They also have surprisingly good salads for a pizza joint which is a bonus."}
{"text":"Super fast delivery. It surpassed my expectations as far as how delicious it was. I will definitely be ordering again.  Try the meat lovers"}
{"text":"I love this pizza, the quality and service is great. This is our go-to family pizza. They never disapoint and the prices are fair. Delivery is fast. The gyro pizza is amazing! Truly a favorite and something we love to share with family and friends. Also important to know, this pizza heats up great in the toaster oven. So yummy the next day."}
{"text":"I actually have to credit my boyfriend for this place...we had some ok pizza when first moving to town, and I was less than excited to try another random place.  We came from the East Coast, so the boy was real excited to come across these guys.  They left a doorknob hanger on our condo door, so I guess some marketing tactics do work...  This is the only pizza we get now, and on top of the great tasting 'za they honor the coupons over and over again.....  We'll be back for more!"}
{"text":"Probably some of the best pizza you can get around town.  Locally owned.  Friendly staff, who remember my name.  The prices are very good.  I liked the pizza from the previous owners, but the new owners have taken it up a notch.  They deliver, but I always pick up."}
{"text":"I've order pick up online from this location twice now and each time the ordering and pick up process is smooth. The food has been ready as soon as I arrive and the pizza/wings are pretty good! Both times I've ordered using a coupon or some kind of deal they had going on and it's always ended up being a good price. I'll continue ordering pizza/wings from this location!"}
{"text":"Alright I have to update my review..I used to go to this place around once a week or so! I always used to have very fast, pleasant customer service. Now I've noticed a change in management or ownership I believe? It's been updated on the inside, which is nice, HOWEVER during the update process I went inside to pick up a pizza I ordered..two older people (a man and woman) were chatting away, half doing some updates and rudely were blocking the entrance. I made eye contact, I smiled and said excuse me, they still didn't move even when I came in and when I left with giant boxes in my hands. I had to barely slip out the door. the service from the workers isn't as friendly in general as well. Since then, I've ordered one more time. I called in tonight and was immediately placed on hold in a rude tone, same as last time actually, and heard them drop down the phone to finish a side conversation - which I could clearly hear on my end. After some time passes, they pick up the phone and bluntly said hello. I began giving them information, and was cut off with \"whoa whoa WHOA before you go any further\" to ask me to repeat, which would've been fine as long as they asked nicely, but again was met with an extremely rude tone. I repeated again, slowly, and was interrupted again as they forgot what I ordered (I only got one pizza). I repeated again and they quickly said ok 20 min and hung up. Just interesting how the customer experience has truly dropped down...it used to be so nice to go in and recognize the same smiling faces. The old management and team was kind and kept us coming back. They used to even recognize regulars and even when I used to wait for my order, I'd see them treat every customer with the same respect that would come in before me. Now the food is off, not as good, customer service is horrible, and prices have gotten more expensive by about $2-3 more each item. That wouldn't be a big deal if I still received the same food and service lol.  Old review: Fairly good!! I've always had good experiences here, and the owner is always incredibly friendly whenever I stop by!"}
{"text":"I used to order from Clockworks all of the time. They're close to my home and their pizzas were so good!  I don't know what the heck is going on with CW but the last 3 pizzas I ordered were disappointedly disgusting. The cheese and toppings tasted old and sour. Their garlic knots are hit or miss. The last time I ordered the knots were raw in the center. Their traditional wings are amazing, their boneless wings are gross. The last time I ordered their boneless wings I received what looked like chicken strips with hot wing sauce on it.   I used to love Clockworks. Now that they're \"Nosh\", or whatever they changed their name to, the food is trash. Order at your own risk.   Clockworks, if you see this PLEASE get it together and go back to making great tasting amazing food!"}
{"text":"We were skeptical when we saw the area it was located in but when we recieved the pizza.... Oh my goodness it was delicious! The crust is nice and crunchy! We will definitely be back for some more soon! Yum!"}
{"text":"The best around. It's like cheers. They know everones name's. Outstanding customer service. The pizza, wings, salads, and sandwiches are awesome.   They give back to the community. They support the schools.   Highly recommend them. You can not go wrong. Try everything"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery, was pretty quick! The calzones are awesome and I liked that they were cut in strips. Fries are good too! The hot BBQ wings are less BBQ and more hot wing sauce, but still good!"}
{"text":"Love their pizza's!  Can't decide what to order so usually get 1/2 and 1/2 of two items.  Gyro is wonderful and you won't find it many places.  Godfather Clock is outstanding and the White Pizza is one of the best I have tried anywhere."}
{"text":"I order here quite frequently due to it always giving good service. Delivery is great and timing is well. Although the \"From the grill..\" Tends to pack on a bit more meat but it's good! French fries to the chocolate chip cookie tends to be my main cravings here!"}
{"text":"GARLIC KNOTS, GARLIC KNOTS, GARLIC KNOTS! Their garlic knots are usually loaded with butter and parmasean cheese and come with marinara but I will dip them in ranch too. I love their pizza because not only is it thin but it's also topped generously. Given, I do pay to add the extra cheese but still, I don't like biting into plain dough and even without the extra it's still good. As far as price, I've only ordered from Grubhub so it is a bit pricey. Don't expect to leave with anything below $20, but I feel it's worth it. Ive always had my food within 30-45 mins. As far as dessert, I opt only for the chocolate chip brownie...its delicious! It's a fudge-type brownie so it has a bit more texture than just a regular brownie, but maybe it has to do with the refrigeration system. I won't lie and say that every order has been perfect, because it hasn't, but for the most part I've always had an 8/10+ experience every time."}
{"text":"Love the place. I have become a regular but this time my vegetarian family got to see the reasons. Fresh vegetables and they take off olives every time. Yeah!! Friendly and attentive to special requests. The cheese is real dairy and makes the pizza taste fabulous."}
{"text":"I've been evaluating businesses for more than 30 years. What I received a few minutes ago, in a delivery, falls into 1 of 2 categories: 1. The business is failing. 2. The business is destined to fail There are too many good competitors in the pizza business to cut corners and expect to survive. We ordered 2 pies. One a meat lovers and one a vegetarian. WHAT TOPPINGS? Geez!  A few token crumbs. Very slim and wholly disappointing. Nice staff, poor product."}
{"text":"Owners are very cool!  Pizza is okay, but I would recommend asking for extra sauce!  Use your Yelp check-in for a free brownie.  Elliot / Rural"}
{"text":"We've been getting pizzas delivered from here for the past couple of years.  Even though I don't care for pizza  as most people do, I really love their pizzas which have been consistently very good."}
{"text":"One thing is truly lacking here.... It's 2010 people, get a website! With 2/3 of all new food service establishments closing in the first 3 years it would suck if your demise was solely because people couldn't find your menu online. Lots of people want to support local small business but they must be given the tools to do so. Hope to see your website up soon. Oh, yeah..... Great Pie for the $.....cheap cheap."}
{"text":"Good Experience The pizza arrived early an warn. Liked the crust very much. Only the sausage, which was different, kept me from rating a full five stars."}
{"text":"Great. I think it's better than venezia's. This is my place now. The cake is good too. I like the buff chicken pizza"}
{"text":"What can I say? I've been having their food for a year now.  I keep ordering, and they keep delivering solid good food!  The food isn't \"WOW!\", but for consistency, value and customer service they are great!"}
{"text":"I had the Alarm Clock Barbecue Chicken pizza, Gyro, and Caesar salad. The pizza was the bizzle-bom-bom-snack-tastic-dank-shnit!!! The Gyro was piping hot and delicious as well. But the salad wasn't right. The romaine tasted partially cooked, like it was sandwiched between the pizza and gyro. The delivery was very fast and everyone was very nice! I will definitely order from them again!"}
{"text":"Good stuff. The pies are always hot and fresh, and the sandwiches are big, filling, and tasty. Delivery is always much faster than estimated (I order via Eat24, FWIW) and is always accurate."}
{"text":"Saw these reviews on yelp and i wanted some good pizza. I ordered the buff chicken pizza and wings. The food was pretty decent, I'd say 4 stars for that. The delivery was a 5. The guy cracked a joke when i opened the door and handed me my food, which was awesome. I also only waited for 30 minutes when the order said an hour. I'll definitely order again in the future."}
{"text":"I'm new to Arizona from upstate NY. I noticed a pizza flyer on my door. I saw NY tossed pizza. I figured I would try it and see how good it was. I ordered a extra large chicken pizza.. It was amazing. If your looking for a Great pie this is the place!!!"}
{"text":"my review is limited but take it for what its worth... found Clockwork on yelp while looking for some pizza for the crew on a sunday. only wanted a local delivery company. was able to order via yelp, pay via yelp and it was delivered to us about 40 min later. got the super xl buffalo chicken and meat lovers. super big slices.. thin crust.. sauced up the right amount. These were good pies. I will definately get delivery from them again. The team is happy! Thank you!"}
{"text":"My husband and I hadn't found a place that put gryo on their pizza in about 10 years..Then we found clockwork and we gave it a try. The pizza is amazing and if you get a chance try out the calzones  We've tried calzones from other resturants in the past and they never really are that great- clockwork though they have great calzones and the build your own calzone(Your Zone Calzone) is great if you add in Gryo, green peppers and onions. It's by far the best calzone I've had in a long time."}
{"text":"Best pizza around! The buffalo chicken pizza is my go to! Always delicious and delivery is always SUPER quick!"}
{"text":"This is the second out of what will be MANY times ordering from them.  Got a pepperoni pizza and two sandwiches for delivery at 11:30 pm last night.  I don't remember the pizza being so amazing last time but wow, we devoured it!  Just perfect amount of everything (although the bf was just certain I ordered extra cheese.  Nope, it just came that way).  The sandwiches were had today and WOW.  Tons of meat inside and what makes a sandwich an awesome sandwich of course is the bread.  The rolls they use, actually the whole style of the sandwich reminds me of how they come back in NY.  Open late, super fast friendly delivery.  Tip the awesome driver!"}
{"text":"A solid pizza joint that has awesome gyro salads.  The cheese is a bit bland so the specialty pizzas are definitely where it's at. The sausage and pepperoni pizza is my favorite from here."}
{"text":"This is the second time ordering from clockwork pizza.  We ordered over the phone and had no issues. The pizza was going to take about 40 minutes which is normal even for pizza hut.   When the food arrived the driver and i had a good laugh becuase it had just started to rain when they were pulling up. The food was hot and tasted really good.   Havent had a bad experience yet. Will definitely be on my list of go to places for pizza."}
{"text":"Damn good calzone! We love that gyros are on the menu too. Quick delivery and great value."}
{"text":"Clockworks has become our favorite pizza place ! Pizza is excellent. The XL size pizza is a great size and their customer service is awesome! We have ordered deliver and I appreciate when I call they already know my name."}
{"text":"Pizza is amazing, and the garlic knots are the best I've ever had. Fast and friendly service. Would definitely order here again!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome, reasonable, and a great small business that will be huge one day. Their subs are delicious and big, like their gyros. The pizza is way better than any chain restaurant, and the garlic knots and chicken wings are big and excellent. Don't hesitate, order the whole menu!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! One of the best delivery places I have ever tried! We order at least 2-3x a week!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza!   Ordered a large Meat Lover for delivery.  The pizza arrived in about 30 minutes after ordering online.   The pizza was the best I've had in a long time.   The sauce was excellent, and all the toppings flavorful.  The crust was perfect!   I've definitely found my new favorite pizza place!"}
{"text":"I Always order the same pie the grand father clock. I left 4 stars because of other things that make theis operation happen. But the grand father clock is just okay. Not great. And I'll eat every time I want to because that's what I do. I eat things that are okay."}
{"text":"It's very rare I actually buckle down and write a review. This is one of the places that I just had to review. Local, inexpensive, and absolutely amazing. You can always tell a great pizza place by their bread. Their garlic knots are absolutely out of control. Their pizza is amazing, and they don't shy away from adding cheese. Their wings, also absolutely amazing. Very meaty and the sauces are great. If you haven't already, this place is a must try once. Don't take my word for it. Experience it yourself."}
{"text":"Very, very good pizza. They delivered quickly and error free. I ordered a veggie which was excellent but the star of the show was the garlic knots. OMG! These babies dipped and marinara and/or ranch is heavenly. Probably 8,000,000 calories but well worth it! Will order them again, and again, and again."}
{"text":"Yummmn! We got two pizzas and garlic knots. The pizzas were fabulous and the garlic knots were super garlicy (in the best way possible). Delivery was prompt and everything was accurate. Will definitely order again!"}
{"text":"Overall a great local pizza! The workers were really friendly and the pizza was flavorful with a really good crust. It struck that perfect soft/crispy balance.  They have some really great specials so be sure to ask!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out and the service was fast.  We received our food warm and the cheese was still melting.  We ordered from this place because of the special they had: large 2 topping, 10 wings and a 2 liter.  We liked the taste of the pepperoni and the sausage was good too.  That's where the good review ends.  The bread was like cardboard, the sauce and the cheese didn't stand out with flavor and the top was greasy.  Our wings were Medium flavor and had no special flavors that stood out either.  Even the ranch dressing was thick and needed some ranch flavor!  Sorry, this place made us a little sick that night, not our favorite among local pizza joints."}
{"text":"I recently discovered Clockwork Pizza and can't get enough.  Best delivery/takeout pizza in town."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite pizza place in Tempe. The gryo/feta pizza is delicious. And their garlic knots are delicious and buttery."}
{"text":"Classic local pizza, subs, etc place. I had a calzone- made fresh and hot.  They also deliver with Grunhub"}
{"text":"Owners take pride in their food and everything is alwasy fresh.  The place is clean and the food is reasonably priced. They have slices at the  ready and their lunch selection has a good variety to choose from.  I love the chicken salad...it's big enough for two, and the chicken marinade they use gives it a nice flavor."}
{"text":"Just moved in down the street and stopped in for the first time. Service was great! Guy at the counter was cool and helpful. Got a medium calzone with meat and veggies and it was ended up being bigger than I thought and was great! Worst part was not having enough sauce to dip it in but the food was awesome and so were the people working. Definitely recommend it and will be going back!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to pizza joint for ordering pizzas to be delivered to my home. I live a mile and a half away from the business and the pizzas are always delivered on time. The pie is hot, the salad is chilled, and the Coke is ice cold.  I typically order the Pendulum White Pizza. I don't eat meat or poultry and the combination of ingredients on the Veggie Pizza aren't my favorites, so when I'm not in the mood for the Pendulum White, I order a Cheese Pizza with my choice of one or two ingredients.  The unfavorable reviews of Godfather's Pizza seem suspicious to me. They're too laconic to be earnest critiques of the food or the service. Conversely, the favorable reviews are generally thoughtful, thorough, and descriptive. To me, they seem written to be genuinely helpful and are therefore more trustworthy."}
{"text":"Got a coupon to try this place...love the pizza...love the boneless wings and the Greek salad was bomb!"}
{"text":"Consistently good.  Hot when it gets here. We order from here 1-2 times per week. Salads are yummy too."}
{"text":"It's definitely not our favorite, but Clockwork sure beats those nasty chains (think Dominos, Pizza Hut, Little Caesars) when we're thinking, \"Yeah, it's pizza and wine night!\" And for about the same price!   Discovered this place when we moved to Chandler last year. Someone stuffed coupons in our door.  Haven't tried delivery, but it's close enough to our house to drive down the street and pick up.   Everyone we've encountered in the store has been incredibly friendly.   Love the Greek Gyro Pizza. Plenty of Gyro meat and fresh vegetables for toppings.   It even comes with a side of tzatziki sauce!   The Godfather Clock Pizza is also good; just your classic combination pizza.   Glad to have Clockwork nearby!"}
{"text":"For the price and the convenience, I would say this is a pretty good place! I got the garlic knots that smelled slightly better than they tasted (they were a little more bland than I expected, but otherwise good) and had a little more oil than necessary and a small Godfather clock pizza (which was all good, except the olives were a little off). I appreciated that the pizza came with a free side of ranch and all this together was just a little over $11 with tax.  They have slice specials in-store, too, that look to be a pretty good deal.   Mostly, nothing too terribly special to write home about. I wouldn't drive out of my way to go here, but I definitely would choose it over some of the other options in the area, especially now that Papa John's has decided that a few cents per pizza is too much to pay for health insurance for his employees.  I'm much happier supporting local anyway."}
{"text":"Litterally the best pizza I have tasted so far! I'm a New Yorker so this reminded me so much of home. The proportion of the cheese and the tomatoes is just right! The sides are crispy and delicious. I ordered boneless wings too and they're mouth watering!! Thank you so much for not disappointing. It was my first time and ordered through doordash but from on I am a returning customer!! Thank u for delivering to my expectations."}
{"text":"Just ordered two pizzas, salad, and breadsticks last night. Terrible. Pizzas got hard before we were done. Save money and buy a froze pizza, because these taste worst. They must use some prefabricated dough. Food also made me ill as soon as I was done. Still paying price. Unless you want a nite sitting on porcelain, avoid."}
{"text":"The best pizza I've had in the area. Pepperoni/banana pepper pizza and the garlic knots are my go-tos."}
{"text":"This place is busy for a reason. Bomb slices! The owner is super cool too. Don't let any of the bad reviews fool you. It's legit!"}
{"text":"My family loves clockwork pizza. The Slice app could be a little more intuitive but that's not on CP. we love that this pizza has a thinner crust. My daughter absolutely loves the Garlic Knots, they are super good, expect a lot of Parmesan sprinkled on top of them. The pizzas are not overly saucy but they are very generous with the toppings. My husband said the Honey medium wings are really good as well. When you order through the app you can pay online so it's a very quick in/out when you get the pizza. It is a very small shop designed for takeout primarily though they have a couple small tables for you to wait at or possibly eat a slice.  Be sure to ch do the whole app to find the coupons/specials there's pretty much always a deal to be found."}
{"text":"Good solid meat lovers pizza. Prompt and the whole ordering system through paypal is just perfect.  Quick and easy, highly recommend."}
{"text":"The only pizza place I've recommended in the valley. I recommend a well-done pie so as to crisp the cheese more and keep the dough just right."}
{"text":"It's not terrible pizza, if you're looking to fulfill a basic pizza craving you've come to the right place. The pizza is not particularly memorable, but I'd eat it again because it is acceptable and better than some. The garlic knots are subpar though. I struggle between a three and a two star rating for a pizza place that makes basically ok pizza yet has a semi clever name."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had in a while, highly recommend this place.  Ordered for the first time, staff is friendly, service is fast, and most importantly the food is amazing.  We ordered a Hawaiian extra sauce and cheese. Out of this world good. The quality of the ingredients are exceptional."}
{"text":"It's been a must every weekend now. I can't imagine any other place since I've found this spot. Consistently delicious and awesome. Extremely generous and hospitable owner. Excellent customer service. This place is a gem. Best wishes. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza, salad, and wings from here last night around 11:00. Food arrived quickly, even though my townhouse is very hard to find! The pizza was very high quality for delivery style, the wings were amazing, not dry and they weren't shy with the sauce, which I love.   This will definitely be my new go-to delivery place!"}
{"text":"I ordered a greek salad, gyro and fries-- it was sooo good!  Delivery was timely too!  I took the salad to work the next day and ate it all!  I'll definitely order from these guys again!  Great stuff!"}
{"text":"I ordered pizza and wings and forgot to change the delivery instructions from the previous order. The delivery guy was mad out of his mind even though it was only a few apartments down.  He told me how I \"had to change the delivery instructions\" and almost threw the pizza at me and stormed away.  I called the manager to tell him how I was treated and they didn't do anything for me, the only thing they were willing to refund was my 20% tip.  The delivery guy then called me back to harass me about why I said he was rude!  What in the world is wrong with these people?!  I cannot believe I have to worry about this guy harassing me now and the manager could not do anything for me but give me my tip back?!  Even after the guy has had complains of having anger issues!  I will never give this company my money, they are the reason I am having home security installed!!"}
{"text":"The pizza here is fantastic!! Cheesy, not too much sauce and amazing crust. Not too buttery like Pizza Hut, not too dry either. Just awesome. The garlic knots are by-far the best I've ever had. Easy, quick delivery and just great pizza. Plus, what a sweet name. Bravo Clockwork, BRAVO!!!"}
{"text":"Pizza was delivered within 30 min. Yay!  Ordered the large godfather clock pizza, Crust was really good, just enough toppings..   Paired it with salad.. Chicken salad and Italian.. They include two servings of dressings. Really fresh salad, non of that wilty lettuce at this place. Lots of meat/chicken..   Their Greek explosion hot sandwich is really good.. Lots of meat including chicken and yogurt sauce.. With red onions, lettuce & tomato is perfect for lunch or dinner  We are New to the area, will definitely be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"I love Clockwork.  I think the pizza is awesome, speedy delivery, and cheap!  I'll take them any day over any of the chains."}
{"text":"Good food! Terrible management. Manager (owner) was so rude and discourteous I can honestly say it deterred me from ever coming back. When you are new ownership and take over an already great establishment- you would think that customer service would be #1 on your list- as you are dealing with people. May I suggest an etiquette class. Everyone else is doing a good job. You should try  if not stay in the back where no one has to deal with you"}
{"text":"I am downgrading my stars from 5 to 2. Why? I have been a regular customer for months now but my most recent experience forced me to change my mind.  I asked for extra gyro meat and was told that I would be charged $5! The sandwich is for $5.99 so why would ANYONE not pay the extra dollar to get a second sandwich! I have been charged $2 for extra meat prior but this time asking me to pay $5 extra was a tipping point...it's a matter of principle not 2 or 3 $ extra....very disappointing for such a great place! I don't think I will continue to do business here any longer...."}
{"text":"I ordered clockwork pizza near closing time, and was surprised they offered delivery service to me which was a 3 mile drive. It's was delicious and very fast!"}
{"text":"Terrible service and even worse pizza.  The crust is chewy and the pizza is greasy.  Oh and did I mention that don't take their own coupons.  What a joke!  You can get much better pizza at just about any other pizza place in town for a better deal."}
{"text":"The delivery was super quick but the pizza was just okay.  Nothing special about it at all, but they do offer delivery later than most places in town."}
{"text":"Ordered 3 20\" pizzas for take out, feeding 12 hungry teens.  Order was ready when promised (20 minutes) the pies were very good and there was WAY more than necessary to go around.  Will be back."}
{"text":"We ordered 2 14inch pizza for delivery which costed 15.99... It was a special they were having.. Online it said it was going to be 45 min wait but it turned out to be 30 min.. Which was nice.. The pizza it self wasn't bad , if i need to order pizza again in the future now I know to have other options around my neighborhood than dominos or papa johns.."}
{"text":"I ordered the lunch special which is 2 slices (BIG) of pizza and a drink for $4.99 (Great price in my opinion). The pizza was good but it was a lil greasy. The workers were nice and easy going. Overall it was ok.   I went back for a second time and tried the calzone. Got to be honest it did not blow my socks off. I was looking forward to a great calzone and it just did not do it for me. Most likely I will not be going back, there are just better places to get pizza."}
{"text":"Very good pizza and fantastic salad. Order from here using eat24 when're I've don't want to go out."}
{"text":"This place is reallyyyyy good. Had it twice in one week once I discovered it. Both the boneless and bone in wings are delicious as is the pizza."}
{"text":"Very good food excellent service. I ordered a sub and i got a free brownie with a coupon. Tony the delivery driver was very nice and friendly. 2 thumbs up"}
{"text":"What will happen if you eat this pizza?.....let me tell ya!! Gut rot. Stomach ache. Feel like death. It may have helped had they given us a little more pizza with our grease."}
{"text":"Great lunch specials, got the two slices and drink. Massive slices, delicious toppings and great crispy crust. A bargain and friendly staff."}
{"text":"The main reason for the perfect star review is not only great tasting pizza, but their commendable consistency in taste, customer service, and time.   Imagine this: A lactose-intolerant foodie craving some good hearty pizza on a Friday night. Sounds crazy doesn't it? But it DOES happen folks! I'm here to tell you that I am living proof of the scenario described above. But what's a gal to do when she can't eat that ooey-gooey-melt-in-your-mouth-what-makes-a-good-pizza CHEESE!? I'll tell ya what; she goes to Clockwork!   Let me tell you this IRL story. So I get off work, it's 5pm on a Friday and like I said, my stomach's growling \"pizza, pizza, pizza!\" I ring up my good old buddies at clockwork, (such good buddies that I have them saved in my contacts... Yea, that's right), and I say \"hey dudes, I need a godfather pizza, XL, and hold the cheese!\" And you know what the cool part is? They don't even question it! They're just like alright, cool. And that's that! Other pizza places just give you an awkwardly judgmental silence on the phone and say \"wait, no cheese??\" So discriminatory!   Anyway - 30 minutes later, I've got my amazing cheese-less pizza with such powerful flavors, you would seriously think cheese was on this. So if I know that a pizza from here without cheese is possibly the best pizza I've ever had, well, think of the possibilities YOU have WITH cheese! For all you pizza lovers out there, cheese tolerant or not! Order from here! I'm telling you, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Nice staff, pizza was just so, so.  A little skimpy on the toppings I thought."}
{"text":"Delivery service was faster than anticipated. Order the godfather click pizza. It is a little greasy. Wasn't undercooked which was great. The bbq wings were tasty. Wish it had an option online to change out the ranch it comes with for something else--for no cost. Ordered the Tiramisu which tasted old and freezer burned. Not tasty. Would like to see healthier options like turkey sausage or turkey pepperoni but I know it can be costly. Will try again in a few weeks to evaluate consistency."}
{"text":"Today was my first trip to Clockwork Pizza and it won't be my last. I walked in to place a to-go order and was out quickly. The staff was very friendly, and most importantly, my food was tasty! I ordered pizza and breadsticks. You shouldn't be disappointed here. Also, it smelled like really fresh French fries when I walked in. Definitely plan on trying them soon!"}
{"text":"A better than average Pizza delivery business - It certainly beats out Domino's and the other national chains. The lunch specials in their shop are an amazing value too - good luck getting a seat though."}
{"text":"My pizzeria to go ! Just around the corner of my house. It does not matter, what I order, it is always excellent Ordering before is possible with Eat24 and works great."}
{"text":"Wow! That has to be the worst pizza I've ever had. Estimated pick up time was way off, I showed up early and still the food completely cold when I got it. I had to microwave it to make it edible but even then it was bland and had a funky texture. Waste of my money and waste of food as I have no desire to eat a second piece (and that's coming from a pizza addict)! Pizza Hut or Dominos would be a step up, don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"Best thin crust pizza! Great customer care. Been coming here for over 5 Year's and it's amazing every time!"}
{"text":"First time coming here , ordered the special of 6 wings , 1 slice of pizza and a drink for $6, pretty good price .  The cashier was extremely friendly and so was everyone else . They offer great prices , fresh food and awesome pizza and wings . Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This was my first time ordering from this place and I wish I had found it sooner. I got 3 items, and all of them were delicious. The first item was a large calzone with; chicken, bacon, and garlic. I have ordered calzones from a lot of places in the area and this was by far the best. It was quite large with generous portions of all the ingredients, for less than what most others in the area charge for a pitifully small calzone. The marinara was a bit bland but that was easily fixed.   Next I had an order of 10 boneless wings in bbq hot. I was surprised with how large each one was, the smallest one was an inch around and about an inch and a half long, most were much bigger. The sauce was tasty and generous, but for me was more of a mild. As others have said the ranch that comes with it is good.  Last I got their garden salad with greek dressing. I recommend getting extra dressing because it's a large salad with a lot of toppings. I got 2 extra containers by ordering extra. Everything in the salad was very crisp and fresh, and the dressing was very good.   I ordered at 8:50 on a Saturday night and got everything about 30 minutes later. All in all I'm going to be coming back quite often and seeing what else they have."}
{"text":"Very good! I got the medium bbq pizza and it was great. Pretty reasonable prices too. Took about 30minutes, but it was a Friday night so that's perfectly reasonable"}
{"text":"These guys have never disappointed when you order delivery. Fast delivery, fresh tasty pizza, and the price isn't bad at all. Overall have been pleased with them since I moved to chandler."}
{"text":"Clockwork has some amazing pizza and amazing wings! I love this place. Not sure how they make their wings, but they are on point! Not a fan of their small over priced cheesecake,  which is too bad, but the cheese they use on the pizza is amazing. Highly recommend if you haven't tried!"}
{"text":"my work ordered pizza from here today. I truly appreciate that they treated us but I have to be honest and let you guys & gals know that the pizza was nothing special at all. I would not return on my dime. Very dry, bland."}
{"text":"Clockwork pizza is my go to pizza place. The Pendulum white clock pizza is excellent! If you can't decide what to get."}
{"text":"Clockwork pizza is so freaking good! It's more pricey than the pizza you'd get from Papa John's or Venezia's (which is horrible btw), but it's so much better.   I usually get either a large pizza with different veggies on it and the garden salad with Italian dressing, or I get the small pizza if I just want pizza for that day.   The guy who takes the orders is also very friendly even when I take long time because I'm very indecisive.   Glad my gf turned me on to Clockwork for when I have a pizza craving.   I've never had anything other than their pizza and salad, so I cannot vouch for anything else."}
{"text":"Not bad. I can definitely list 2-3 other similar pizza joints here locally that taste better. Lunch specials are ok, pricing is too high because they only give you a can of soda with it rather than a fountain drink like normal. Seriously, get that fixed. Location is SMALL. Only 3 tables that share the lobby, I'm not going outside in AZ! Don't plan to come with many people. Best items on the menu weren't pizza, their fries and garlic knots were KILLER and well priced too."}
{"text":"Had I written this in February when I moved within the range of this place, I would have given it a lower score. The food was inconsistent at first but after March, I tried it again, off-handedly, and it was spot on and it's been spot on ever since. Zero complaints, even the driver's are 90% on time if not early. (noticed one younger man who usually is late but I tend to just avoid those days he works according to my patterns.) Keep up the good work, if this is the 'only' delivery option that you have in the area, you can do MUCH MUCH worse. Consistent, quality, doesn't skimp on topping and temperature is on spot 9/10. Thanks for the great service.   High quality items, Calzones, GARLIC CHEESE BREAD IS ZE BEST in the valley if you ask me, Pizzas.  Med quality items - wings bones/bonless... found the same. The sauce is a bit harsh and very arroatic (if you like that, I prefer temp and flavor usually) seems a bit off on texture. Tried 3 different kinds, still the same.   Low quality items - nothing"}
{"text":"First time ordering from Clockwork. I didn't even know they were there!  I'm a foodie - there's no question about it... and this girl likes her pizza. What I don't like is the crap that's served by the plethora of chain places. I absolutely won't dignify those places with business.   When it comes to \"the best\" pizza, yeah, Chris Bianco, Spinatos, La Piazza etc. are all \"best\", but they don't make sense most nights of the week. Enter Clockwork. I will definitely order from them again.  The lady who answered the phone was friendly and helpful. She said the pizza would be there \"as soon as possible...\" and we got it almost exactly an hour later, which was a little disappointing.   What was delivered was a very tasty, well put together pizza. We had the \"Godfather\". Peppers, onions, mushrooms, sausage and pepperoni.   It was a great pizza at a great price... again, we will definitely be ordering from Clockwork again."}
{"text":"My first time ordering through yelp, thought I'd try it because I didn't know what was near by that delivered, it's been raining most of the day and I hate driving in the rain. I ended up ordering from clockwork pizza. It came super fast even with how the weather was, the guy was very nice and my order was all there.   I ordered a large pizza half pepperoni and half gyro meat. It was very good. I finally found a pizza place that I can get the pizza with marinara, normally (at other places) I get light sauce, no sauce, or buffalo sauce instead of marinara because the flavor is overbearing or tangy. Clockworks marinara is definitely to my liking, yay!  Also got the Italian salad which was the best I have had in a long time! Even compared to Italian restaurants, such as Rigatony's, that tend to not give you many toppings in the salad. This salad had so much meat and cheese, as well as other topping like banana peppers, bell peppers, and onions.   Very happy with my experience and will definitely order again :)."}
{"text":"Clockwork Pizza has the best pizza I have had in Tempe.  The sauce has an interesting flavor to it and they do not overload the pizza with too much cheese like some other local places.  I moved here from New Jersey in August and the Clockwork Pizza guys are also from New Jersey.  I will definitely be getting pizza from Clockwork exclusively now.  They have a small storefront, but are great for take out and delivery."}
{"text":"Good pizza, better than the known name brands around. Definitely not chewy or crusty. We enjoyed what we ordered here and rate them higher than the other regular places."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Can't go wrong with the Garlic Knots. Their calzones are amazing and I never leave hungry. Their food is addicting."}
{"text":"Love their subs and calzones! Fast and affordable pizza place. My kids and I eat here a few times a month and have never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"The best pizza in Tempe, Phoenix, Chandler and Mesa. They have Halal and everything is amazing. Go there now"}
{"text":"The garlic knots are pure heaven! ! Great pizza, great prices and thumbs up on their customer service!  I love the online ordering convenience. I really need to try their salads."}
{"text":"It was my first time ordering from Clockwork. I must say the quality of the pizza was good, not greasy. However, it is bit pricey. I ordered 2 large pizza + tax + delivery was = $45. The large portion is not so\" large\", I would say more of a medium.  Overall, good pizza, good service. I will order next time, probably not deliver because it was pricey."}
{"text":"Great service. Great pizza. The people working here are personable and you can tell they wanna deliver a quality product. I just found this gem and I'll be coming back quite a bit."}
{"text":"Clockwork is one of my top 2 pizza places.  The other one is so expensive that I'm probably done with those other guys.  Clockwork has good, fair and reasonable prices, and I've never felt ripped off when I get my food.  FYI I never shop Domino's, Pizza Butt or any other chains.  They suck.  MY MENU SUGGESTION: They first hooked me with their Pendulum Clock WHITE PIZZA.  It's scary how good it tastes (I leave off the spinach), and it's guilty of making me CHUBBY for pete's sake!  Ought to have a warning sticker about that potential on the pizzas, and maybe the calzones too.  When a pizza joint turns you into a Muffin Top then you have a serious dilemma: do I share my delicious discovery, or do I keep silent to save the world from more Muffin Tops?  So...what would YOU do?!"}
{"text":"Best pizza ever! The white pizza is my favorite. Great price too. Friendly customer service. I use them personally for delivery. Always on time or before promised. My non-prof uses them for feeding our youth and various adult functions. Everyone asks who made the pizza because it's sooo good!"}
{"text":"Forget about customer service, but the pizza is great. The customer is not first here, the phone order is. I had to wait behind approximately 3 phone calls, in an empty location, even to be greeted. The Extra Large Italian Pizza that we ordered was quite tasty and at a more than fair price of $15.99. They also had fabulous prices on a special board outside. The Greek Salad I ordered was advertised to have romaine lettuce, however there  was only iceberg lettuce beneath the noticeably canned toppings. I'd definitely pass on the salad next time. Additionally, I ordered a 2 liter pop that was not given in my order to go. Apparently, although the beverages are not in the waiting area, it is expected for you to go behind the counter and take matters into your own hands. When I called in to inquire about it the manager said, \"I thought you got it\". Yummy pizza, poor customer service."}
{"text":"My pizza was so good! Crust was perfectly bubbly and crispy! Delivery took about 35 minutes and he was very friendly. My husband's pizza looked like a work of art and he said it was good. We will be ordering from here again for sure.   Just ordered for the second time. Pizza was good overall but I ordered mushrooms and there were probably 2 slices of mushroom on each piece. Kind of a bummer."}
{"text":"This pizza place is great if you have an hour and forty-five minutes to kill waiting on the pizza to arrive. I called them after an hour and they told me my order was out for delivery, then called them back 30-minutes later only for them to tell me my order was almost ready and would be there soon. One hour and 45-min goes by and I'm still waiting for my pizza to arrive."}
{"text":"So we ordered to go- we ordered a LARGE pizza thinking it was going to be A LARGE pizza but it was actually a medium pizza! The way the named their pizzas should be explained when someone calls.    The large pizza was a medium The extra large or HUGE pizza was actually a large.  Then they have the very large one with an odd name.   Can you just name the pizza like they should be? Lol  Or have the employees explain that when orders call in."}
{"text":"I am giving them another star based off a previous review because of their customer service. I love local businesses and these guys really care about their customers."}
{"text":"Wonderful pizza - had a fully loaded pizza with normal crust - had never heard of this place - a friend said it is a must eat pizza and whether it was pizza or sandwich or calzone that I would find it one of top 3-5 in the valley - she won - great pizza - awesome sauce - good price - great value - delivered quick - delivered perfectly done and piping hot - we had the Godfather - extra ranch sauce - no charge - the turkey sandwich is fantastic also - try this pizza - it's a must try - sorry barros - you've been displaced in our house after 12 years"}
{"text":"I've only ever had delivery here. It is my favorite delivery. They have great toppings options, easy online ordering, and overall delicious pizza."}
{"text":"We went here for the first time yesterday to support Marcos De Niza High School and were amazed at how we have never heard of them before.   The food was spectacular!    We got a thin crust pizza and a meatless calzone which was extremely good.  We will be going back there for sure.  Thanks Clockwork for supporting our local schools!"}
{"text":"We decided that we wanted pizza and since we were relatively new to the neighborhood decided to look on Yelp. This place got pretty good reviews and we had a coupon so Clockwork was our choice. The telephone ordering was a little bumpy, with the guy not understanding that I wanted two different pies, not a big deal but a little annoying. The pick up went very smoothly and the guy behind the counter was very friendly (I think it was the same guy). The pizza was tasty and hot, my only complaint was that I think they were a little light on the toppings. Overall a credible pizza, better than many others. I'll give them another try."}
