{"text":"Absolutely terrible. I ordered a Beef Lo Mein from them. It was ready surprisingly fast. But it was heavy and warm. When I got home, I opened the box to find a pile of noodles with some barely cooked vegetables and less than 20 grams of beef. The beef quality is also poor - I couldn't chew through half of it. Not sure if foreigners know this, but Lo Mein means Sauced Noodles... I didn't find much sauce in my noodles either. This restaurant is an embarrassment to Chinese food. I won't come here again. Instead, I'll go to Perfect Kitchen when I'm in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"It looks like a hole in the wall and a place where you don't want to eat, but man oh man is the food amazing. It's basically a take out place, there's only 2 chairs on a side table that you can eat on, but the food is very well priced and very tasty. The won ton soup sure tasted great when I had a bad cold and their beef with broccoli is second to none. The food is made to order and always pipping hot, even after a 10 minute car trip home. Defiantly a place to go for Chinese food and they're actually even better then a lot of the all you can eat buffets out there."}
{"text":"Really good Chinese food.   It's only take-out....although there's only two chairs in there...iv eaten inside before.   They have cheap lunch specials for under $10, very good.   The place looks kinda sketchy, but I mean food is food and its basically take-out. I don't have any complaints from their food...yet!    Yummy chicken balls!"}
