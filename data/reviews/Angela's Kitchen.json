{"text":"Living in Sun City Grand, we thought we would bring visiting relatives to Angela's. Thought the view of the golf course & lake would be nice. A great part of showing family how beautiful this place is.  What a mistake! I was totally embarrassed how awful the food was! Plus the windows were absolutely filthy!  My nephew had to send his Mahi Mahi back & told the waitress it was inedible! I had an awful salmon salad. Two orders of prime rib, well we took it home & have it to our dog! We should have realized this. The waitress greeted us with \"we have only 4 pieces of Prime Rib left, and they are cooked medium\"! In other words the were cooked already at 4pm????  I totally embarrassed! I took a chance & bought family to Angela's and it was just plain awful & the food just plain disgusting!! Never Again! Now I know why it was empty! Gave 1 star because the waitress tried!!!"}
{"text":"We were invited to breakfast here for my mother in laws birthday.  It wasn't very busy. Our server Leila was nice and did the best job she could with the limitations of the kitchen and management. The food took quite some time to come out.  And it came out in waves. One of the plates took an extra 15 minutes.  My steak was overdone and dry.  Some of the scrambled eggs were green. Other eggs that were orders over medium were almost raw.  The omelet  must have sat under the warmer for quite a while.  We asked to have the sun shades opened up to see the golf course. It was very nice. Apparently they don't open the shades until \"Angela \" is ready.  My father in law asked to have the meal that was served late taken off the bill.  Angela said no.  Apparently Angela thinks pretty highly of herself and has forgotten about customer service.  With so many great options out there, skip this place and find and establishment that values customer service and quality."}
{"text":"Had dinner here late last week with a group of 6.  I have eaten here before and know what to expect, (not too much), but this meal was well below even \"Angela's\" par level.  When speaking with the manager, our party was berated as if we were at fault for the under cooked chicken, the over cooked burgers, the chewy potsticker apps and hot salads.  The waitstaff is put in a horrible position with the managements lack of professionalism and class in this establishment. The sad thing is its the only \"game\" for now in SCG, but a \"little birde\" told me  not for long. Keep your eye's peeled for the \"new\" after golf establishment just down the street, within SCG.  Yeah!   The only thing Angela's has going for it these days are the buckets of beer....  Also, on a side note, the men's bathroom has been in need of service for almost five weeks, the stench is just charming, and yes, multiple complaints have gone on deaf ears -"}
{"text":"My wife and I have lived here for 15 years ,we have watched this place go from dillings to the way it is now I have to say the head bartender she is very rude,now days  when she came in she was supreme have to say she is burned out very rude woman."}
{"text":"My husband and I just had \"lunch\" there for the first and possibly the last time. We were looking around at homes that are on the market and decided to try Angela's.I had looked at the menu on line and it looked interesting. My Husband had wanted to try the Turkey Wrap with fries and I the Mediterranean chicken wrap with potato salad. First we waited about 3-4 min to be seated on the patio, no one else waiting. The patio was very nice except for the occasional  waft of fishy lake smell, can live with that. We hadn't even sat down when our server came over and we ordered Iced Tea. We weren't told it was peach flavored but it was good. We hadn't even cracked open the menus yet so we don't know if that is how it comes. Ordered our lunch and waited a good 20 + min for the food.  It came and looked OK, nothing special. I tried one of his fries and it was pretty bland and not crisp. His wrap had loads of sliced turkey but he said both wrap and fries were quite salty. I tried a tiny bit of his turkey and it was very salty tasting. Now my Chicken Wrap. It was supposed to have chicken, olive tapinade (sp) and mixed greens. I think there was to be red onion and cucumber in a spinach wrap. They got the greens and wrap right. There was very very little chicken (maybe 4-5 pieces that were 1-2 inches for each small half). Very little if any tapinade, onion or anything else except for a salads worth of greens. Very dry and no flavor. The potato salad was very sour tasting. Finally the waitress came over after I had the few bits of chicken and after I complained, said that there is to be a whole chicken breast it in. She sent the manager over and he seemed more interested in giving me another. No thanks. I mentioned the potato salad and asked if there was sour cream in it. He said it was to have spicy mustard, bacon drippings (eeish) ,chives I think, not sure about the rest. I kept asking if there was sour cream in it and never did get an answer to that. He picked up the small 1/4 cup serving, (a good size for salad dressing ) smelled it and asked again if there was anything else he could bring us. He tried but I just wanted to come home and get some lunch. He did comp mine but I think we'll try Coco's next time or come back to the  Vistancia area for lunch."}
{"text":"Angela's suffered from a slow and awkward start-up in Sun City Grand, some of their own doing and some out of their control (Dillon's leaving was not a popular thing, and there was holdover difficulty in the transition, most outside of Angela's control).  Our first experience there was very so-so, bordering on negative.   We decided to give it another try a year later on our return to Sun City Grand...and boy, are we glad we did!  What an improvement, in every way....service, décor, food, you name it, it's better.  A lot better.  The home-made pasta specials are truly outstanding, and many of the daily dishes are a cut above, at very reasonable prices.  The onion soup is too sweet in my opinion, but that's about the only thing to complain about!  Well, I guess the other thing is how crowded they are starting to get, because the \"good word\" is starting to rapidly spread.  If you tried Angela's early in their arrival and were disappointed (as we were), I urge you to try it now.  They've made some very good adjustments, and the food is better than average, and in some cases FAR above average."}
{"text":"New favorite place in the Sun City area! A nice & abundant selection of entrées, good service and a refreshing upgrade on ambiance for the Sun City area! We took my Father here for Father's day and everyone loved it!  No, it's not your quiet romantic restaurant, because you also have people coming off the gold course."}
{"text":"We were their last night between 5:30 to 6:30 p.m with friends , the noise from the bar area was terrible  . Even worse was the food we had, not one person at our table had a meal that they said they enjoyed. ! We had Izaiah  as our waiter and he offered to get us something else but we were afraid to try something else ."}
{"text":"Really really good! One of the best restaurants in Surprise!  Great service, good food. Nice place to take visitors.  Highly recommend.  Servers name was Jordan, he had great suggestions and was an excellent server."}
{"text":"First time here and we loved it. I had the Chicken Marsala and my wife had the Wild Alaskan Salmon. We were both very happy, ate every last bite!!! It is located in Sun City Grand, but open to the public. So a must for Surprise residents if you're looking for a new place to eat and have great views of the golf course."}
{"text":"We have eaten at Angela's several times.  The food has always been very good.  The view is wonderful.  The only complaint I might have is when they are really busy the noise level is pretty loud."}
{"text":"This was my first time here at Angela's Kitchen. I'm really glad I decided to come here for an appetizer and a drink!  I got the hummus which came with cucumbers and pita bread. So good!!!! I am impressed with view. I sat at the bar top and enjoyed the company of the bartenders while over looking the golf course and the water front. The staff is very attentive and personable. If you are a golfer, you will enjoy this place.  Park your golf cart and come grab a bite to eat and a wonderful drink."}
{"text":"Why do people with poor experiences at Angela's write here? Because the owners and chef will not listen to your concerns, much less budge on their rules of order. The only insurance for Angela's remaining open is that it has \"convenient location,\" and a nice view (if the window flies don't disturb you).    Worst of all is that in late 2014, Angela's prices continued to rise and any consumer benefits such as true specials (that would be a price drop on a freshly made or regular meal choice); and/or  a normal \"happy hour\" disappeared. Happy hour is squeezed to 4P-5P only  (for those who do not imbibe, the normal is usually 3:30-6:30P.)  Too bad on the latter decision Angela's, because in off-season, we who live here year round in the community and work (yes, work) have been your life-line and used to stop 2-3 times a week after work before 6, meet other residents, enjoy a cocktail on the end of happy hour, and then regularly stay for dinner. At your prices that's saying we were spending $70+ for two, 2-3 times a week, plus friends' same cost.  Free education: it's called a \"loss leader: an item sold at a price below its cost [e.g., happy hour drinks] in the hope that customers who buy it will also buy other things\" [which they were].  Readers, note in particular the recent remarks here from a family that tried to enjoy a birthday breakfast (2/1/2015); in part, \"late and cold waffle.\" Rather than \"comp\" when Angela was asked,  she basically said \"eat it\"?  We are finding and sharing other great restaurants to welcome everyone's dining dollars."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed Angela's Kitchen.  I went for lunch and it was excellent.  We had the Calamari  which was amazing with Artichokes  in it.  Likewise the schnitzel and fish and chips were outstanding.  Nice atmosphere, friendly service, and nice view."}
{"text":"Disappointing to say the least.  On May 22, around 6:00pm, 7 of us went to Angelas.  Most of our party were from out of town.  Chicken Parmesan was burnt..  The chicken on my Chopped Salad was so dry it was like eating Jerkey.  I left over half and when waitress asked if I wanted a box I said no citing the dry chicken.  We then ordered the last Creme Brulee .  One bite proved a runny milky substance so no one wanted a taste after it ran all over.  It barley covered the bottom of the bowl."}
{"text":"Over fried paper thin  ( possibly meat) schnitzel..... BAD While others had pasta primavera that was good... Won't go back"}
{"text":"Mmmmmm!!! The best pork shank I've ever had , and Angela's signature cheesecake tastes like its straight outa the big apple... Great atmosphere, and wonderful service what else can you ask for . Awesome happy hour also !! Definitely will be back !!"}
{"text":"We frequent Angela's about once a month. The service is always excellent and the food is fresh and good. Place has a very clean feel."}
{"text":"Had Thanksgiving dinner at Angela's with a party of 6.  All agreed the dinner was terrible.  The worst TDay dinner I've ever been served and possibly the worst meal I've ever had at a restaurant. My turkey was a pile of little bits of turkey, the stuffing tasted like a soggy pile of water soaked bread, cranberry sauce had some strange spice that ruined it.  5 of our dinners were served with no gravy on the potatoes, and no stuffing, or cranberries on the plates and we had to ask for all these items.  The yams were dry and tough, cauliflower too strong to eat and the gravy was a tasteless gray disaster. The only thing that was even acceptable was mashed potatoes.  I have eaten there before and the food was acceptable,(not great) so I was shocked at this total failure."}
{"text":"We have been to Angela's a few times now and have never been disappointed.  You can order from lunch or dinner menu which is great. You can see the pond no matter where you sit.  We have had Sondra as our waitress several times and she is more than super.  I think the guy is Joe and he is really a hoot.  All the wait people are outstanding.  My husband says the martinis are great.  We always try something new each time we go there and have never been disaointed.  Our son said the meat loaf was really good.  That's something when he thinks his recipe is the best.  LOL  Its a restaurant you can depend on being always good. My favorite is their salmon."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Tilapia is outstanding. Regret not trying this place sooner. Went back again and food was equally good.  Mahi mahi with a pesto sauce was perfectly done. They need to pay more attention to the vegs. Too much salt and garlic for me."}
{"text":"bad server.  terrible fish sandwich.  but the young girl hostess was excellent & my son's chicken parm was good."}
{"text":"Food is good ! Service is however not good! We asked to not rush the meal before the appetizers and while still eating our salads dinner arrived. Waitress then brought the check and never offered coffee or desert. Both of which were wanted."}
{"text":"Mediocre food. Sort of blah. 3 visits to this place and can't say much for it. On 2 occasions the check was wrong. One of our party had the Chicken Wrap and hardly no Chicken in it. Avoid the Caesar Salad, old and tasteless. Service on all 3 occasions was non existent, once food is delivered usually by the bus person the waiter or waitress could not be seen or found. Most of this type of food can be found in a  low rate diner, like a Denny's or Coco's. Maybe all is so tasteless due to the senior clientele. A waste of money and time."}
{"text":"Outstanding service, beautiful view, delicious food, great wine list! We've eaten at Angela's Kitchen several times since it opened, with groups large and small, and have never been disappointed. It keeps getting better!"}
{"text":"Great staff and super menu. We have been dining here since opened. It is about time our beautiful community had a great restaurant! Angela's a great menu...try the Coco ut Shrimp Appetizer...or the Beet Salad...then try the Clams and Linguini .then No wait for the servers to know you from a previous dining experience and bring you the wine you enjoy!!! Thank you Forest, Paul , Joe and Kayla!  Vince, Mario, family...we feel a part of the success you have earned! Love this restaurant and all it offers to the snobby residents of our community, Sun City Grand!!!"}
{"text":"We were there last night. Very crowded but scored a table outside. The food was pretty good but the waitress we had was miserable. We asked her to not bring the meal til we had finished salads. Of course that request was ignored and the dinner showed up shortly after salads. She then brought the check before asking if we wanted coffee or dessert. I like the place but after last night we will rethink going there."}
{"text":"Just had an early dinner here and it was one of the best meals I have had in a while. We had the French onion soup, tomato bisque, littlenecks and linguine, beef stroganoff and cheesecake. The cheesecake was divine and I'm sure everything else on the menu is amazing."}
{"text":"This is the only place I know of in a 5mi. radius that has OSSA BUCO. When it comes crispy on the outside it is usually pretty good,tender but not much flavor. One thing I do not like is no complementary bread or even crackers befor the meal.  One more thing you cannot substitute a vegetable. If the meal comes with broccoli and you want asparagus tough luck. It seems many items on the dinner menu are just not available most the time. Service is slow and unattentive at best. The captive Grand owners keep this place alive."}
{"text":"I love the food here, my favorite is the chicken picatta, the staff is super nice and the view is to die for!"}
{"text":"We were totally disappointed with this restaurant. The place was so noisy that a conversation at the table was almost impossible. The food was nothing special. The vistas were much better than the food. Not worth returning."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch and we were pleasently surprised. Very clean updated decor, fast friendly and attentive service nice menu and the food was excellent. Everything is made in house even the fries."}
{"text":"We dined at Angela's Kitchen in Sun City Grand tonight.  I had the Lupara sausage and pasta  special and it was excellent.  Our server was very good and handled a table of twelve as well as could be expected..  My wife was advised that the oriental chicken salad was good which was not true this night.  The chicken amounted to three tiny pieces of very hard chewy chicken.  There were very few pieces of mandarin orange, no almonds, no bok choy, no green onion, very few crunchy noodles, and a question of whether or not it was really Napa cabbage. She described it as the worst oriental chicken salad she has ever been served.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"We sat on the patio on St. Patrick's Day and  our service suffered immensely. Hardly a wait person came out of the door to see if we needed anythying. Food was warm to cool, accompanyments were missing. No place mat s, no table clothes; I was glad they gave us silverware. Other than more water, which was offered, they did nothing additionsal to help us enoy our meal. Like salt or pepper, mustard ? or horseradish cream for corned beef ?  A St. Paddies Day was advertised as a big deal for them. Too bad they didn't get a buy in from their employees. Won't return again.."}
{"text":"Great place.  Came with parents and their friends.  I wasn't expecting much at an active adult community but it was great.  Great wine list, great service and the food was really good.  Oh the view is great if you sit outside"}
{"text":"Is there a really good restaurant in Surprise besides the Vogue? Angela's isn't it.   In fairness it is stuck by its Sun City Grand clientele. I don't think a non resident would drive here to eat.   The menu is limited and overpriced. The service inconsistent.   The entree salads are side salad small.   The bread, if you can call what they serve bread, is white tasteless mush.   They are trapped by residents who don't care about quality, only price."}
{"text":"3.5 stars is what i would like to give but not an option on yelp. Anyway. Nice job remodeling and BIG improvement from crappy digusting Dillons. Nice portions and decent quality in nice enough surroundings. Crabcakes were plentiful with crab, pest pasta with fresh basil. All in all solid faire. Service was pleasant enough and nicely timed. Well done, we will be back.  We went back last week. Service SUCKED. Food honestly was not as good as first visit...uh oh...inconsistency KILLS."}
{"text":"I cannot imagine that someone would come here unless they are already at the Sun City Grand community.  It is the only restaurant here. We were visiting friends and came for a late night dinner during the week.  The place was busy, but by all means not full.  When we were finally seated I couldn't figure out why they had us wait for close to a half hour for a table.  And they don't take reservations. The lamb burger plate was okay as was service. I imagine that the view during the day must be pleasant and I might give them another try."}
{"text":"Absolutely love Angela's Kitchen.The menu has a very nice variety, excellent quality and the place exudes a really positive energy.  Prices are fantastic and everything is just yummy - on top of that the views are breathtaking.  Everyone so friendly, and oh my gosh Shannon is just the greatest bartender.  Outstanding quality and service  - and isn't that what we all are really looking for : )"}
{"text":"So.....it's unfortunate with such a great view that they have DISGUSTING FOOD! There menu read \" Grass fed Demi\" what is that? Boneless pork chop..it was a pork loin ponded out, NY Stk was also ponded out, escargot was GROSS, I say this only  because as I stated it has a beautiful view. I believe it was 7:30 & our server came out to let us know they were out of mash potato, however my friend was able to get hers which was fine until she gave me a taste \"STRAIGHT POWDER MASHERS\" WE dine out & this place has to be just as bad as the last place we ate HERB BOX anyhow I'm tired of wasting money on mediocre place...THEY ARE HORRIBLE although we did see a new place up the street opening called BABBO that will be our next stop & I'm sure they will be better. ."}
{"text":"This place sucks. Portion sizes are inconsistent from one visit to another. There French fries should have had an oil change 10,000 miles ago. I asked for some Crispy FF because the ones that came with my fish fry were limp and oily so they replaced them with some that were even worse.  Avoid if at all possible"}
{"text":"We went there for Thanksgiving dinner and the food was terrible, I thought the place was getting better but it took one step forward and now it's taken two steps back, what a shame."}
{"text":"My grandma and I LOVE coming here! We've enjoyed the updated menu and new items. Great selections of salads, entrees, and appetizers, few local AZ beers on their selection and nice cocktails. We often bring friends and family who are in town for a visit. I always get the lamb sliders, without fail...except the last visit I was in a fish and chips mood. :-) And I wasn't dissapointed! The fish was delightfully crispy and well-seasoned, not too 'bready'. The patio can get really busy on a nice day..be prepared to relax and wait a few extra minutes for service if you choose to be seated outdoors."}
{"text":"While visiting my Mom and her husband they took me here for dinner since I'd never been before and we wanted to stay local. I really liked the atmosphere and the view is amazing - we sat out on the patio and it was gorgeous! I checked in on Yelp and was surprised to see that they have a Yelp offer for free hummus - it was SO good and definitely a great start to our dinner which was super tasty. Service was prompt and friendly too - I'd definitely recommend coming here if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"The past two times that I have been to angelas I had a negative experience. The first one I ordered a chop salad with chicken. it literally had three pieces of chicken on it and it was more herbs then salad it was not very good at all I will say the server was nice enough to add more chicken. The second time was about two weeks ago I ordered a hamburger I found what looked like a piece of toothpaste tube. The bartender was serving us he was very nice but I would expected my meal at least compt but instead they gave us for dessert that I really didn't need or want. the point is what I found in my burger that's really upsetting"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, good service, good food, prices raisonnable, really impressed by the quality of food, definitely recommended with and amazing view on the golf course with pond of ducks"}
{"text":"Took my grand daughter here for lunch today for her 39th birthday and truly regretted it. The service was atrocious. Our waitress was so slow at times we thought she left. The building. Then I asked if they did anything special for birthdays and the response was negative. I then asked for a dessert menu and I was told they ran out of desserts over the weekend. Excuse me? It was TUESDAY. She scrounged up a piece of cheesecake, but it was stale and distasteful. I wish we had gone somewhere else. We will next time."}
{"text":"Ordered Blackened tilapia with wild rice and sting beans and it was delicious! So moist and flavorful. Would definitely recommend this to anyone. Staff was very friendly and attentive. Can't forget about the amazing view! Great experience very pleased and will be returning."}
{"text":"I live in Sun City Grand, so this is a convenient spot.  Prices are reasonable and I've never had a bad meal, as some others have described.  Just returned from a birthday dinner there--we were a table of 4 & were seated promptly, received menus, and had our drink order taken.  The server followed up promptly and answered a few questions about how items were prepared & what was included with different entrees.  Meals arrived quickly enough, and food was hot but not scalding--not left under heating lamps, but served promptly.  Bread, butter, water were all refilled as needed & the server was there, but not intrusive.  The place was packed when we arrived, but that's to be expected the week of Christmas & everyone seemed to be having a good time and enjoying themselves.  We 4 were happy with the evening & 4 different entrees."}
{"text":"Nice local spot for dinner. Chicken piccata was good, service was friendly and efficient. Menu is varied and view is great."}
{"text":"WOW! What a surprise, We use to eat hear when Dillons what at this location. Have not been back here since they moved. Wife over heard someone talking about Angela's, they said the food was pretty good? So we ended up trying Angela's for the first time! Well, It's now one of our favorites in Surprise. We first had their BBQ ribs appetizer, very surprised by how tender it was but also it had a crunch? Turns out after they slow cook their ribs, and the meat actually just falls off the bone. They deep fry them before serving, never heard of this before. And it worked. Wife had the BLT, not much you can do with a BLT. But it was very good. Overall we had a very good time. Service there was great, manager came by and said hello. This is going to be one of our regular stops."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with this restaurant.  We were looking for a new place to try and saw this one advertised.  So I checked it out on YELP and felt it was worth a try.  Plus we got a free appetizer if we checked in.  So we tried the coconut shrimp for an app and were not disappointed.  They were crunchy and quite tasty.  I had the salmon for dinner.  I am quite picky about how my salmon is prepared.  This was wild caught salmon and was prepared to perfection as it had a flaky consistency and a delightful buttery taste.  I'm not a big fan of the green beans that were served with it, though they were prepared well.  I also had the beet and feta salad which I absolutely loved.  I HAD to try dessert because I'd gone days without my chocolate fix!  I had the homemade chocolate cake with ice cream.  Heavenly--it was so moist and flavorful.  The service was great as well.  Prices are very reasonable and we loved the ambience of the restaurant and its setting."}
{"text":"I had heard varying opinions of this restaurant from friends, and this was our first visit.  It was a rainy Monday night, so we did not expect a crowd.  The wait for the dining room was 45 minutes or 25 minutes for the patio.  We did not really want to sit on the patio, but neither did anyone else.  They seated us by the fireplace but they do not have any patio space heaters.  We did take advantage of the Yelp offer for an appetizer.  It was OK.  There was plenty of hummus for six people but skimpy on the dippers.  OK turned out to be the adjective for the night.  The service was OK, the drinks were OK, the food was OK.  Not one of us had anything that made us think we really wanted to return.  The pro was it's convenient location in SCG.  It was dark so we didn't get to see the view other reviewers have enjoyed.  I wouldn't tell anyone to go there but neither would I tell anyone to stay away."}
{"text":"I have dined here many times while visiting family in Sun City Grand. The food and service all always very good. We sat on the patio this visit and the setting sun made the golf course view very nice. I really enjoyed the Crab Cake BLT sandwich, it was delicious! Their fruity martinis are really good too! The patio overlooks the course and ponds and it a great place to enjoy a meal and drinks with friends and family!"}
{"text":"We have been to Angela's before and were happy with the service and food.  Today we took my sisters to Angela's, they were visiting from Washington, and were sited promptly to our table.  We sat there for over 25 minutes before a waitress named Sondra asked if we had been helped.  We replied no, and she apologized for the wait and stated she would wait on us, even though it was not her area.  Sondra was magnificent and attentive to our needs.  The food, as usual, was very good.  Please patronize Angela's and ask for Sondra, she will make your dining experience a very pleasant and fun time.  I will say that the manager came to our table and also gave his apologies to us.  Thank you Sondra for making my sisters feel welcomed to our great community."}
{"text":"Beautiful atmosphere and great food. I was very disappointed with how cheap this restaurant is. I had a party of 13, I asked for A SLICE of cucumber for my water, and was told, \"no we can't do that\". Wth?! I'm paying for 13 meals and you can spare me a slice of cucumber?? Then, we had a cake and we used our bread plates to eat the cake off of, and cut our own cake, and we were charged a cake platting fee! They didn't even have to clean any extra plates or cut the cake for us! So ridiculous! I have never been to a restaurant that nickel and dimes you like this! Word to the owner/management, if you want repeat customers, don't be cheap. Was the $7 cake playing fee and not giving me a slice of cucumber worth losing 13 customers over?"}
{"text":"As I begin my 2018 restaurant / bar review project, please follow me as I will be visiting most establishments in the Surprise area (in alphabetical order) First up: Angela's Kitchen:  This restaurant is situated within the planned community of Sun City Grand and open to the public.  The restaurant space itself is beautiful with nice views of the abutting golf course and accommodates patrons with outdoor seating. I have now on two occasions visited this establishment.   First experience (dining seating) began with being seated (indoors) immediately, but then waiting approximately 15 minutes to be acknowledged by wait staff. The dinning area was about 1/2 full. After reviewing the menu and ready to order, I was told they were \"out\" of my first choice.  My second choice arrived overcooked and portion size was a touch dismal.  The concentration seemed to be on plating the food artistically, rather than focusing on quality.  Upon receiving my bill, I was \"up-charged\" for additional salad dressing. The servers explanation was that I had asked for dressing on the side - apparently that costs extra.   Second experience (bar seating).  There is a half wrap around bar, multiple high table tops, televisions and outdoor seating  Again the space and golf course views are quite nice. I sat at bar and was acknowledged within a few minutes and quickly received my first drink.  The staff did not promote to me any drink or food specials that may be occurring during my visit. All was going well when suddenly the demeanor of the bartending staff went south.  My observation of the negative behavior change seemed to coincided with the bar section filling in quickly.  A patron sitting next to me stated Happy Hour had just started. The bartending staff on shift was far from enthusiastic.  The conversations and behaviors of the staff behind the bar became incredibly unprofessional.  Demeaning patrons within earshot of an unknown guest (me), gossiping about patrons and outright negatively commenting about gratuity amounts left.  While ordering my second drink and asking for a menu, the bartender rudely addressed a patron sitting next to me with \"Ah, you're just going to have to wait\".  I found this odd, as that patron had not even muttered a word. This bartender rolled her eyes at me and stated, \"he is just a regular\".   As this establishment is within a planned community, one would conclude the majority of patrons would be residents of Sun City Grand; so why on earth would you treat these patrons in this manner? I ordered an appetizer and began to observe more closely the behavior of this staff.  By the time I finished my second wine and appetizer, I could without a doubt, identify who was a regular patron vs not, simply by the unprofessional, petty behavior of the staff.    My overall impression of this establishment is not a positive one.  I do not believe this establishment would survive outside the walls of the Sun City Grand community. If you enjoy having mediocre \"pretty\" food, slightly overpriced drinks and watching poor, unprofessional behavior, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Visited with family and friends. EXCELLENT  service and a beautiful dining experience overlooking the golf course water features. Weather was perfect last night to be on their patio dining room.  I enjoyed my crabcake appetizer. It's complimentary with two entree purchase and a Yelp check in. Awesome :) My son tried their grilled cheese, but he didn't really like it. I think it was missing butter on the bread as it was grilling. I saw several items from the menu as it was served and the French Dip and Pasta seemed like favorites. The fish and chips was a bit greasy I overheard. We had one friend who has food allergies and our server and chef were SO accomodating and helped create a dish she really enjoyed safely. Overall, a pleasant dinner because of the staff care and company, and a perfect place to bring out-of-town guests."}
{"text":"We had the most unfortunate experience this morning at Angela's kitchen. Seven of us came for breakfast for my mom's birthday. They live in Sun City Grand and apparently the only reason Angela's kitchen survives is because there aren't any other choices besides Coco's. Let me start out by saying the server was very nice and did her best to keep our water and tea glasses filled for the 1 1/2 hours we sat on the patio waiting for our food. When it finally came out, my dads eggs were green from being over cooked or sitting under the lamp for too long, mom's omelet looked like it had been sitting under the lamp for an hour. My sister and nephew ordered at the same as everyone else, but his came out 10 minutes after and my sisters waffle came after EVERYONE was finished with their meal. Let alone that we asked for them to open up the patio shades a couple times and they wouldn't because ANGELA wasn't ready to open them yet. After my sister finished her waffle while we all sat and stared at her, they brought the bill and didn't even credit the waffle or my nephew's meal. My dad went in to speak to a manger and apparently ANGELA, said she wouldn't credit any of the meal because the server explained it would be late after everyone else received their meal. I would say ANGELA needs to take a class on customer service and go back to business school (that's if she went in the first place).   ONE OF THE WORST EXPERIENCES I'VE EVER HAD FOR BREAKFAST.   STEER CLEAR OF ANGELA'S KITCHEN AND ANGELA."}
{"text":"Great bar, but because of prop 206 ALL drinks up by $1.00. No buckets or pitchers now. Makes all of us regulars looking ELSEWHERE.  Management pay attention to your regulars spending $300-$400 week,  not your BOTTOMLINE   I stand corrected about Angela's prices. They only changed their Happy Hour Prices by $1.00. Evening prices are still the same"}
{"text":"Our server Joanie is the absolute best. Loved her enthusiasm and energy. She New the menus extremely well and was very helpful. Food and drinks were fantastic, sit on the patio much less noisy than in the restaurant itself. Plus the view is perfect. They do have heaters if so desired. We will go back."}
{"text":"Long story short, they were out of everything I wanted to order. They didn't want to accommodate. The service was practically nonexistent and cold. The menu was overpriced. When our food finally arrived I was so irritated at the point I just wanted to eat and get out of there. Will never return."}
{"text":"Terrible food today at lunch they ran out of tuna fish,hamburger was bad,salad looked like it was in the early AM,soggy and limp.Save your money go else somewhere else."}
{"text":"We visit some friends of friends here every year, and every year it gets worse. And it started out bad. It's expensive, the food is teetering between mediocre and bad, and the policies they have there are just terrible. Over the years I've had them screw up boxed pasta with flavorless sauce, overcooked hamburger, and countless appetizers.  They refuse to accommodate simple, common requests from customers as if they are a fine dining establishment when in reality it's a failing restaurant in a retirement community.  All of the above said, our servers really tried their best and were quite good, the view is nice. Guessing the management is delusional, as all signs point to it."}
{"text":"I have eaten here at least 10 times and have almost always found it to be great.  The service tends to be above average and the food very good.  Only once or twice did I think the food was not so great (the turkey burger could have less spice) but overall this restaurant is great to have in the neighborhood.   The deserts are very tasty (I love the cheesecake) The setting is very nice with beautiful views of the golf course."}
{"text":"We have eaten at Angela's several times, with friends, in hopes that it would I prove; it hasn't! The food is terrible, the prices are way too high for a senior community and the service is not so hot either. I would stay away! Lovely location though."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like Angela's. It's close to home, the prices are reasonable, and the service is friendly. Sadly they are really struggling in the food department. The plates look stunning but fall short on taste. My medium rare steak arrived well done and unseasoned. It was obvious that the cook forgot about it as it was very dark on one side and the other had almost no color. Culinary 101, season meats before cooking people. It's not that hard. Service was friendly, a little slow, but I don't like to be rushed at dinner so it was ok with me. The drinks were made well and dinner for 2 with drinks was $75. I might try it again if I knew they had a new kitchen staff."}
{"text":"Capping off an otherwise non-pleasant day, we decided to head to Angela's for dinner.  Our server, Sondra, was absolutely great.  She made sure my quite senior mother was pleased, comfortable and more.  Service was above and beyond and the meal was delicious.  Only our second visit there, but we shall return. Sondra most certainly is an asset to this establishment.  Thanks for a great experience."}
{"text":"This place is within my parents happy little community in which they live so the location can't be beat.  The location could be great. To their credit, I've only ever eaten outside but the fact that they don't clean the bird poop off the chairs and railings before opening for patio dining is just gross. This REALLY needs to change!!!  Despite that one BIG flaw, it's great for a yummy meal (crab cakes are great as is the salmon) or a cold beverage outside. The staff is always very friendly and the service is quick and accurate.  We'll be back but I really hope someone in management see's this post and decides to clean things up."}
{"text":"Today was our second visit and equally enjoyable!  Quiet relaxing atmosphere with pretty views of the golf course.  Our server was great and the food excellent.  I had the Grand Burger with fries - home cut with the right amount of salt and crispness.  Burger was generous in size and cooked as I requested.  Brioche bun was fresh, lightly buttered and grilled and equally tasty.  My husband had the Ham & Swiss wrap with potato salad.  He was very pleased although the portion size was smaller.  Potato salad was homemade and served in a small ramekin.  He is a fairly picky eater and I thought it might be more 'gourmet' that he would like but he ate it all!  We were too stuffed for desert bug s table next to us ordered ice cream and the serving size looked generous.  I would definitely give Angela's a try!"}
{"text":"Was here in May,  a group of 14.  Drinks could have come faster.  For a group our size we only had one waiter.  He was very nice and hustled.  He had his hands full.  I had a special burger it was awesome with bacon.  Really delicious.sat on the patio and it was a really fun time.  Think all had good tasty food."}
{"text":"Saturday night, sat at the bar. One bartender said he'd be with me in a minute. He then disappeared. I sat for 5-10 minutes. 3 golfers walked in and the 2nd bartender asked what they wanted. Even they said that I was there before them. The bartender said they were slammed and she didn't see me. 3 bartenders in total. Very poor service !!"}
{"text":"Dojhd in he will in fvm Msehomex gkx. K mknklsy ho I'll be ok jj I miss him m No rrlknx see"}
{"text":"I had dinner at Angela's Kitchen very recently with another couple.  I must comment that the food was nothing short of spectacular.  I ordered the traditional lasagna and it was incredible with a homemade meat sauce.  It was neither too spicy nor too salty.  Everything is prepared from scratch and not microwaved as is very common in chain restaurants.  For desert I ordered the cheesecake and once again it was prepared from scratch.  It was a wonderful meal and I  plan on retuning very soon."}
{"text":"Quiet and tucked away, it's hard to find unless you're looking for it but well worth it!  My sesame tuna - the first time ever trying tuna not from a can and mashed up with mayo and a bunch of other stuff - was spectacular.  I was so impressed, I now order it regularly but never have I had it prepared and presented as perfectly as it was here.   Plus, bunnies. Lots and lots of baby bunnies outside. Too cute."}
{"text":"Terrible, slow service. Paid $$$ for a special Italian night meal. Needed a magnifier to see the clams and mussels. No bread served with it. Parmesan, crushed red pepper were requested and never arrived. Wait staff was nowhere to be found. VERY POOR service. It's too bad as the setting is great but they honestly don't care about the customer."}
{"text":"We live in SCG and frequent Angela's for lunch. We have never had a bad experience there. Sure, it gets busy, but that's because it serves good food. I always discount the occasional \"one star review\" because there are some people that cannot be pleased. Sometimes, as a patron, you have to make allowances. So, if you want a pleasant place to eat, one with a wonderful view, Angela's deserves your consideration."}
