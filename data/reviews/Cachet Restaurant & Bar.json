{"text":"Went today for lunch. Had the burger. Tasty, nothing special. Small. The size salad was good.   Wife had the turkey club. It came with a lot of back which is usually a good thing, if it was cooked. The bacon was picked off and avoided.   We went bc of a groupon.   Nice place. Had a good pizza sitting on the patio in the summer."}
{"text":"Seems they've got a new chef at Cachet, and it's made a huge difference in that I've actually added a star to my previous 3-star rating. Go Cachet for making that incredible change.  Last night my 3 girlfriends and myself went out for martini's, food and Christmas gift exchanges! We got a table no problem, and it was packed, which we've never seem before. Just a testament to the positive changes made at this establishment.   I got a martini, which was great - sour mama! Then, seeing at it was 10:30 and I had eaten dinner, I just got the fried calamari and bumbleberry crumble for dessert. The calamari was crispy and warm. They were awesome and changed the caper remoulade for regular, yet spicy, seafood sauce. I was appreciative and it was very yummy. My friends got the gnocchi, lobster ravioli, and green curry bowl. Other than having too much sauce in the curry bowl, everything else was awesome and they had no problem accommodating our minor changes when ordering.  Now, the dessert. I rarely order dessert because I find it's hard to get something at a restaurant that I can't make better at home. But Cachet offers house made options. So, I tried the bumbleberry crumble, which was mixed berries topped with oats and granola and a nice scoop of maple pecan ice-cream all served in a cute mason jar. All I can say it I was in love. If I could marry a dessert, it would have been this. It was the epitome of a Canadian dessert. Berries were fresh, oats weren't too soggy and the ice-cream - I tried to BEG for a pint to take home. Cachet, get on it!!!  Overall, I was super impressed with the new chef and changes made in the kitchen. Kudos!"}
{"text":"Our family loves the patio at Cachet and that's why we and most people continue to go back. My service experience is different every time we go, sometimes good but mostly always slow. I've had a few very disappointing experiences with rude staff (even the manager), but we've also had some really great servers. I wish they'd completely revamp their menu. They need some new fresh options to keep people interested. Nothing on their current menu stands out. Everything I've tried has been good but never great, definitely over priced for the quality of the food. They have such a great location it's too bad they can't bring the other pieces to the puzzle."}
{"text":"skimpy skimpy skimpy !!!!  Scallop appetizers were like tiny little peanuts.  My 10oz steak was definitely not weighed.  It was about 1cm in thickness at the thickest parts.  Very disappointing.  Flavour was good though.  Won't come back.  Felt ripped off.  Oh, forgot to mention, there was a long brown hair in my wife's crème brulee.  Since I'm still describing, I'd also like to mention that the members in our group who ate the green curry spent the night 'squirting'.  If you know what I mean."}
{"text":"Poor service! Server was extremely rude!! Was rush out at closing!!! Manager told us to leave because he had to go home although, he was inside chatting with that staff about his house. Will never return!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"4$ Caesars on the weekend.. Basic but tasty. Nice patio, service was ok food came quickly. Wouldn't recommend the Sea and Brie Dip but calamari was ok."}
{"text":"Nice location, nice ambience. Had the prime rib sandwich, was really tasty, loved the  fries (real potatoes, not processed). Margarita pizza was terrible. Most likely a $3. frozen pizza from the grocery store. Seriously. Service was ok, an offer to refill the pop would have been nice.  Would give another chance, but hoping for better."}
{"text":"The WORST restaurant  I've ever been to. The staff is just incredibly rude, the wait for a server to do you the \"favour\" of acknowledging you takes forever, after you finally place your order you have to wait another eternity for your food to be delivered to your table. The quality of the food is sub par (everything was greasy and looked unappetizing) and overpriced. Don't even think about calling a waitress over!, you'll be left waiting AGAIN. If you want to change seats or to another area of the restaurant, TOO BAD!. If you are thinking about complaining to the management/owner, don't bother, because the rude waitress/manager, also happens to be the owner's daughter. After you finish eating, they quickly try to rush you out (there's other people waiting to be seated and ignored, you know!) and they expect you to leave them a tip. What a joke!. The only thing this place has going for itself is the location. The current owners should do Newmarket a huge favour and put it up for sale so someone that really knows about food, customer service and cares about their reputation can take over."}
{"text":"We were there two weekends ago when the weather was gorgeous. OK, let's be honest. The ambiance of sitting on the Cachet patio on a warm, sunny, and slow afternoon is second to none! The food is ... OK. Nothing bad about it but my wife and I go really just for lounging at the patio. We've had the Reuben Sandwich, Club Sandwich, burgers, salads, etc. All were pretty good, though expensive at about 15 bucks a sandwich. The service is OK and can be a bit too \"relaxed\" at times - which is irrelevant if you have an afternoon to blow back a couple of slow pints. In short, go for the patio first. The food, second."}
{"text":"Terrible service...numerous times. So many chances given to change our minds, we're now in full boycott mode...even in the summer when they have the best sited patio in the region.  We have now decided Cachet deserves no more chances. For example, we have been seated for over 30 minutes without a drink order taken...with servers purposely avoiding eye contact so they do not have to take our orders. Another time a waitress took our drink order then when delivering our beer advised us that we should hurry up because it is late and the staff wanted to go home.   The food is priced as though it is fresh food - although it appears that only garnishes are fresh, overpriced and unfocused menu. It would be nice if they trimmed down the menu and picked a few items to make well and from scratch.    This location is too good to be wasted, time for the town to give somebody else a chance to better use this space."}
{"text":"After such a great experience attending an event at this restaurant, I decided to book my family in here to celebrate my father's birthday. I wish I could say the food and service were everything I was hoping for, and although there were definitely some good things about the experience, my party as a whole found most areas lacking something.  I had made a reservation, and we were able to get a good table outside as we'd hoped. The wait staff did a good job of welcoming us, and we got drinks quite quickly. While perusing the menus and sipping on our drinks though, we were told that they were very busy, and that we could expect a 30-45 minute wait for our food. We were there to socialize as well as eat, so we said that although it wasn't ideal, we were prepared to wait that long. To help get everything moving (at the suggestion of the server) we decided to order our apps and mains right away at the same time, so the kitchen would have all the tickets to work on.  A short time later we got our appetizers. We shared orders of calamari and onion rings, and both were really tasty and very well prepared. At this point we all thought we were in for a great meal.  And then we waited. And waited. And waited some more. The server was trying to handle our inquiries, but basically just said they were busy. And at one point seemed to blame the wait on us ordering ribs, which she said took longer to prepare. Finally though, after nearly an hour and a half (double the longest time we were expecting to wait), we got some food. And even as hungry as we were, none of us were really impressed with our meals. We had ordered pizzas, the pho wrap, burgers, and 3 people were having the beef ribs. The pizza was good. No issue there. And the fries and sweet potato fries that went along with a few of the entrees were very good. But that's where it stopped. Due to a medical concern, one of our party had ordered her wrap without Sriracha sauce. But when it came, it definitely had the sauce all through it. After a couple of bites it was clear she wouldn't be able to eat her meal - but no way did we have the wont or the time to send it back. My burger was okay. Definitely under seasoned, and a little over cooked. And I was specific about what I wanted on my burger, yet, they didn't get the toppings right. And they failed to mention they spear a pickle to the top of their burgers (I was specific in asking what came on the burgers, as I absolutely hate pickles). I had to cut off the top of the bun so I didn't taste pickle with every bite.  Those who had the ribs all gave mediocre reviews - both in taste, and in portion size. I tasted some, and it seemed kind of stringy and lacking taste. I also had some of the vegetables that came with them, and they were kind of blah as well. They actually seemed like underdone frozen vegetables.  After the amount of time we spent there, and the disappointment with the food, we didn't even bother staying for dessert, even though a slice of birthday cake would have been appropriate.  I'm not sure if I'll give this place another shot for a while, but in the meantime they definitely have some things to work on."}
{"text":"Had dinner with a friend tonight, we ordered the sea bass and the salmon. The fish was well done and very tasty, good quality fish. Everything else on the plate was awful. The sea bass came with an extra large portion of lukewarm frozen corn mixes with undercooked peas and diced peppers. For $25 dollars I'm extremely disappointed as I would have expected fresh vegetables and something other than just vegetables... My friend had the salmon, it came with a side of overlooked rice that tasted as if it was Uncle Bens ready made. The salmon also came with a few pieces of canned pickled artichoke. Again, for $25 dollars this is a joke. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"I've visited Cachet many times.. mainly for the patio!  Never been a HUGE fan of the food, it really depends what you get. Pizza is good, once had a nice turkey sandwich. Went recently and found they removed their spinach dip off of their menu which made me sad. Instead, decided on dessert and ordered Creme Brûlée - it was cold..  Its seriously the atmosphere that makes this place. That patio is just awesome to hang out with a group of friends.  Normally I have excellent service, but upon my last visit, service was very slow and poor, although the waitress was pleasant!  I will go back again.. I would actually like to try food from their dinner menu, instead of the usual apps and lunch items I eat."}
{"text":"The outdoor patio overlooking the fountain and water falls at Fairy Lake (more so a pond) along the Holland river and Tom Taylor trail is by far the most scenic in York region. A great place to bask in the sun and take a stroll along the trail or Main Street afterwards, (gets extremely busy Friday/Saturdays if the weather is warm). The staff is friendly and helpful. Great selection of martinis. The food is good, the spinach cheese dip the app of choice. Sandwiches and burgers are better than the pasta. Overall, a great spot for a romantic setting or light meal, (somewhat pricey) but considering the ambience, well worth it if you can grab a spot on the patio."}
{"text":"The line to get in was disorganized.  There were many free tables while we waited in line for a 1/2hr but they were waiting to be cleaned and setup.  Once in the service was good.  I don't recommend the salmon entree.  The crab cakes were good but weren't hot.  We liked the entertainment."}
{"text":"I don't understand how this place has 2 stars. A friend and I decided to visit this place, having walked passed it many times. We were warmly greeted by the hostess. I was definitely surprised to see the upscale interior.   For starters, we tried the deep fried calamaris, a little salty but very good!  Then for the main meals, we ordered the Prime Rib Pizza, which was amazing! The dough was soft with a crispy crust, and each sliced required the use of both hands!  We also had the prime rib sandwich + house salad, and the chicken club +fries!  Everything was tasty, especially the chicken club!  Lastly dessert, were I was not completely satisfied! We ordered the brownie with ice cream on it, and where things went wrong was the brownie. It wasn't really soft, more of a cookie than a brownie. The presentation was great though!   Oh and we also had two 9oz glasses of their Shiraz and Cabernet. Highly recommend!   The price was decent, the entire meal came to around $120 with tip and tax.   I highly recommend this place if you are going on date, or for any special occasion."}
{"text":"Slowest service. Took 10 mins + to get water and for waiter to make contact. Just ordered dessert and drinks, were at the restaurant for over an hour. Watched several tables having to get their own cutlery and condiments because the waiters were no where to be seen. Food did not make up for the lack of service.  Will never return, would not recommend."}
{"text":"When we got there on a Tuesday evening at close to 6pm. The parking here isn't great at all. There's a church next door that has ample amount of parking so be prepared to park on the street ;a 2-5 minute walk down on the main street core of Newmarket.   Cachet has an amazing patio. It over looks the sunset and is spacious! The manager told us he sees a lot of couples come in the summer time and plays songs to accommodate the romantic atmosphere - so thoughtful. I loved the vibe of this place. They had a guy playing the piano and the washrooms were clean. It looks new, modern and trendy but not too upscale.   We learned about the owner Jen who is incredibly charitable. They were telling us how they donated a couple hundred turkeys on Thanksgiving. A lot of their funds goes to charitable organizations. They also have a  communal atmosphere: The guy playing the piano walked in apparently one day and asked to start playing for them and they let him! All this speaks to the culture of this restaurant. A big Thank You!   Appetizers EDAMAME  These were a great snack.   CAPRESE SKEWERS: A great snack with your drinks.   BRUSSEL SPROUTS  Loved these. They had a kick of an Asian glaze to them which was so original.   Main Course:  VEGETARIAN BURGER What a delicious burger. The best veggie burger I've ever had. The juicy patty, the taste and the garlic aioli sauce was incredible. The chef told us it took him a lot of time to find the right recipe for this. Who knew veggie burgers are in demand!   MUSHROOM RAVIOLI  This practically melted in my mouth. I loved the portion, the proportioned mushroom, the consistency.  Overall I loved everything I tried here. The chef is so passionate about making an original menu and works hard to keep up with the demands of having vegetarian and gluten-free options."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday to grab a quick bite, one of the worst experiences ever. The moment we walked to the place and waited to be seated, we already got a bad vibe. We were the only Asians there and we could sense that we weren't wanted. Should have left the moment we saw the looks on everyone's faces. Very uncomfortable. In terms of the food, the brie done two ways ($11) was okay, nothing special. 4 pieces wrapped in puff pastry and 4 pieces deep fried. It would have been better with some type of toast or crackers added in. The pulled beef or pork sliders (can't remember exactly what the name is) for $16 is definitely not worth it at all. It should have been placed under the appetizers section instead of the sandwiches section... The price of the side order of Caesar salad to go with the sliders is an additional $2 which I'm assuming is written at the bottom but when the waitress was giving us options of what we can choose as the side, usually they list out the items that's included for free and if there's an extra charge, they would let the customer know. She never told us about the additional $2, all she said was \"house salad, caesar salad or fries. So we chose the caesar, then we see the charge on the bill at the end. Overall, food wise and experience in general, I wouldn't come back here again."}
{"text":"The service was very slow, salad was soggy, but the patio is great. We were very disappointed and will not return."}
{"text":"Three of us popped in here for a day Saturday afternoon lunch on the patio.Lunch menu had lots of options; Pizza's, Salads, Sandwiches & Burgers  Other options on the menu were far too heavy for lunch steak, pork chops, pastas, etc. I ordered a chicken Caesar Salad which I thought was very good and my Mom and Sister both had Spinach Salads and they really didn't like them. The spinach was not fresh (was slimy and wilted)  and they both had different items in their salads which they thought was kind of odd since I order the same item."}
{"text":"I didn't bother checking in as we made it as far as getting some water and then left.   When a restaurant already gets terrible reviews from several people you know and they start your order with \"just letting you know that there's another reservation after you so if you can order now\" doesn't help their cause. Yes, we were late but the place isn't exactly hopping with people. That also isn't how I would like to be welcomed by my server on first contact.  Finally they gave us no time to give the kids some thought about what to order.   It will take a lot for us to come back and I'm certainly not encouraging anyone to jump at the opportunity."}
{"text":"My friends came to visit me in Newmarket and we were walking around the Main St area to find somewhere that would have a nice patio, accommodate a dog and be kid-friendly. Cachet surely delivered. They even brought out a pitcher of water for our dog and a booster chair for my 1.5 year old (which, btw, was clean and had fully functioning straps). This restaurant is under new management and has a new menu. I've never tried the old menu but the new menu seemed sparse. I'd like to see more selection.   We ordered a pitcher of white sangria, which was full of fresh fruit and tasted delicious. The pitcher kind of makes it awkward to pour and most of it got on the table but that may have been due to our lack of skills in pouring beverages with fruit from a pitcher. Why hasn't anyone invented a fruit sangria pitcher yet?? Lol   The chicken Brie sandwich/ wrap was delicious but considering the $15 price point, they were a little cheap on the French fry serving. I'd like to see a bigger sandwich or more fries- or both! Maybe even a little pickle on the side as garnish? The fries were also pretty limp and seemed like they may have been sitting under the heating lamp for a while. Most of the food seemed overly simplistic but had a high price point.   The waitress was slow to check on us throughout our visit but I'm not sure how many tables she had to take care of inside or if it was busy inside. Overall, a good experience! Would come back again."}
{"text":"I'm not entirely sure about this restaurant. The food is good, the service is great but the atmosphere just doesn't fit.  Maybe it's the configuration of the restaurant or the bar that stares you in the face when you walk-in or maybe it's the linen. Not sure. I'll have to do a second visit."}
{"text":"The service is actually the worst. Waitress has a bad attitude and my appetizer just took 45 min to come out. I had to remind her 3 times about it. Would never come back"}
{"text":"For a few bucks more, you can get a lunch that is clearly different.  For example, take the Reuben sandwich I had recently.  I would expect a couple slices of nice fresh rye bread, a stacking of hot corned beef, sauerkraut, mustard and Thousand Island dressing.  Cachet served me nothing that usual.  This was a \"deconstructed\" sandwich.  Actually, it was not a sandwich, it was corned beef baked in a puff pastry!  On the side were little containers of  hot mustard, sauerkraut and dressing.  My job:  put it together, one bite at a time.  This was a very non-standard interpretation, and I welcome the change.  It made for a \"fun\" meal rather than just hoovering down a traditional sandwich.  The price is higher, and the amount of corned beef was much less than a deli puts on a $9 sandwich, but it was a definite experience that I did not expect, and I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Ordered a green spice curry and a 3 hummus pita appatizer. Must say not disappointed at all. Courteous staff and prompt service in a very casual setting. Food wasn't loaded to salt and seasoning, which I'm thankful for. Great atmosphere to hangout."}
{"text":"First off, I'm not sure why Cachet has low reviews on Yelp.  The burger I ordered was not comparable to what I could get at Ground Burger next door BUT the calamari was perfect and the creme brulee I shared with my husband for dessert was more than perfect.  Its very rare to find perfection in some dishes.  The staff were extremely friendly and available.  We had our meal on the patio which overlooks Fairy Lake.  The place was very busy on a weekday night.    Going inside there's a piano bar and many events that take place here.  I think it's worth a visit."}
{"text":"I love this place. Lets start with that. Every time I eat here I just love the food. I came here yesterday to have the sliders that I had here before. No longer have them on menu as they keep the menu fresh by changing items. ( waiter told me this). I was disappointed till I tried my Ruben Sandwich which he recommended. OMG this is not your typical Ruben sandwich. They don't use Rye bread instead this fluffy pastry I don't even know how to properly describe it other then that. Pastry is not the right word don't know how to call it. Anyhow, the sauerkraut and mustard is on tray separate to add yourself. When I first saw it I was like what is this? Then I took a bite and it was HEAVEN.  A must to try. Seriously a must!"}
{"text":"We went with another couple on Valentine's Day and with the renovations completed plus a new chef, we anticipated a great evening.   We found the service underwhelming: no up selling, no enthusiasm, surprising lack of knowledge regarding rail liquor. No panache.  Our appetizer was delicious: we had the pretzel bread which was served nice and warm with whipped butter. I would come back and just have that with a glass of wine!   The ladies ordered the tenderloin topped with Boursin cheese. Both were to be medium rare. One arrived looking perfect with the cheese just starting to melt on top, but cooked to a medium. The other arrived bone cold and had to be sent back.  The gentlemen ordered the green curry chicken and the short rib pasta. The pasta dish was described as being more like a polenta, and somewhat mushy.   We did have one meal taken off the bill and all received a complimentary dessert.  Will we go back? Maybe in the summer to enjoy a drink and a snack on the patio. However, for fine dining, there are many other places that do it so much better.  One other note, regarding the renovations, the decor lacked sparkle and it seemed like they had just crammed the tables in there! I don't have a reference point from past experience, but it seemed extremely crowded with tables."}
{"text":"There we go! Nice redemption, Cachet.   I came by to indulge in some Christmas cheer with my girlfriends one night in December. The place was busy around 10 but we found seating. Our server was efficient and thorough, not seeming to mind my substitutions/alterations.   Our drinks were delicious. Cachet knows how to do martinis and beverages right.  For the mains, we ordered calamari, green curry chicken, gnocchi and the lobster ravioli. My raviolis were delicious - house made by their chef. I could tell they were pre made and thawed but honestly, what chef is going to make it from scratch the moment you order it? I knew this because one ravioli was slightly colder in the middle than the others. None the less, I loved it. Absolutely loved it! The pasta dish came with 6-8 raviolis. When I first laid eyes on my dish, I was disappointed with the size; I thought I wouldn't fill up. To my surprise, I was full! I was offering bites every which way. The sauce and stuffing was very rich and flavourful. I'd 100% order this again. The girls all enjoyed their meals too, aside from my one girlfriend who felt the sauce to rice ratio was off. Flavour still good though!   Desserts were had - blueberry maple syrup crumble (I think) and lemon cheesecake. The cheesecake was divine. It was silky and whipped and melt in your mouth.   Would I come back? You betcha."}
{"text":"We've heard that the restaurant was under new management so we gave it another try after about 8 years. My seafood linguine was perfect and also stayed perfectly hot throughout my meal. They overcharged us for a $5 happy hour martini ($8.50) and I didn't catch it until I got home (lesson to everyone - check your receipts! ... not just at restaurants). Waitresses were efficient, happy, smiling and made it a worthwhile experience. The menu was kind of sparse, but it was fine. Not five star (although service was 5 star this time). I still see that people either have very good experiences or very bad ones (as per their review on Yelp. The only way you will know is if you see for yourself. At least it was different than our other options on Main Street"}
{"text":"Located in the heart of Newmarket next to Fairy Lake. Large patio that wraps half way around the restaurant. Live Music was both inside and out. A good selection of food to choose from.We were seated inside unfortunately and as the band played it made it difficult for conversations. We all ordered the Saturday special Fillet Mignon which came with mashed potatoes grilled vegetable and your voice of salads, French onion soup or fries/ sweet potato fries. Meat was perfectly cooked, I felt the wait from when the food was ordered to when we received it was rather long. Hence the potatoes and vegetables were less then room temperature.  That been said, our waiter was nice.  Will go back again and sit on the patio next time."}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday evening.  We were seated immediately.  The food was very good.  The prices were reasonable.  Service was good.  The place was fairly busy, and our orders were still taken quickly.  Appetizer and main courses came out quickly.    Sweet potato fries were good.  It would be difficult to get those wrong.  Lobster ravioli was very good.  The brisket burger was excellent.  The brisket on the burger was the best part.  I wasn't expecting the brisket to be any good since this isn't a deli, BBQ restaurant, or a sandwich place.  However, this place did an exceptional job with it.  This is a nice place.  Not overly casual, and not formal.  We would definitely come back."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my mothers favorite restaurants in town. Now the only thing it has going for it is the atmosphere on fairy lake.  The food used to be great, now it's well below average. Myself and another guest had both ordered their steak sandwich, medium-rare. It's to be served open-face on a toasted panini with sautéed onions and a demi sauce.   What was served to both of us was a rock solid over toasted panini that almost caused you to lose your plate from trying to cut through it. Both steaks were medium-well (no pink what so ever). Four slivers of onions (FOUR!) and a watery gravy.   Not at all the quality of food this place used to be.   Again it's redeeming factors are a great location near fairy lake and decent staff. Although our server was less then receptive to our complaint about the cooking temperature of both our steaks.  If your looking for good drinks and cheap martinis on happy hour, this would be it, otherwise avoid."}
{"text":"I loved the patio and my wine . We had sweet potato fries , calamari , coconut shrimps and mussels in garlic and white wine sauce and have to admit didn't enjoyed. Sauce was lack of flavor , everything else was over fried and you can see the oil used for a long time by the way fries look.  There is a Room for improvement for sure."}
{"text":"Waited over 45 minutes for a sandwich. Yes I realize it was Friday but it was after the 12 noon rush. More than enough servers on hand but still no food. If you are going to charge high prices at least provide good service.  Won't be back"}
{"text":"As the temperature gets warmer, we came here for the patio. Terrible decision to come here.  The food took a long time to come and when it finally came, it was horrible.   I had the margarita pizza. It tasted like a frozen, microwave pizza. Imagine a McCain frozen pizza but slightly bigger and with tomato slices on it. The pizza also wasn't very hot when it was served. Maybe it needed a few more minutes in the microwave.   The boyfriend had the pork chop. The pork chop itself was dry. The chips on the side was burnt and the veggies were overcooked.   All in all... I would recommend coming here for the beer and the patio. But do not under any circumstances order food. You will regret the food...  Edit: the manager came by to talk to us as we pay the bill (because I could only stomach one slice of the pizza). I told him we didn't like the pizza and that to me it tasted just like a frozen pizza. He got very defensive and said repeatedly that the food is made fresh in house and the chef made them fresh.  I would have had a better impression of the restaurant if the manager asked for feedback and how to improve and not get defensive. I get that he needs to stand by his chef. But everyone's taste is different and I just happened to really really dislike the way this pizza was.  BTW, I like my pizza with a thin crispy crust."}
{"text":"The only thing this restaurant has going for itself is its martini menu and the patio overlooking Fairy Lake. The food is very pricey,  the staff hardly give of a welcoming vibe and the food is barIely adequate. I ordered a Turkey sandwich; the bread was soggy and dripping with grease. The side salad was ok but I ended up \"refunding\" my meal in their bathroom toilet after only eating a few bites.  If you're looking for a nice patio than I recommend this place but only if you plan on having a drink or two and no food."}
{"text":"I've visited Cachet regularly and recently it went through an ownership change.  Still great service, amazing bar and wait staff. The food is not quite the way it used to be however they may be still working out the kinks.  It's a great location and ambience so will definitely give it another try."}
{"text":"Nestled in the heart of old Newmarket, this restaurant has a beautiful patio overlooking Fairy Lake park.  We stopped here for some drinks after taking a long walk in the park.  We had a couple beers on the patio... it was very relaxing, and that is exactly what we were looking for.  They had old soothing music playing, a nice selection of drinks, and we munched on some Cajun Shrimp appetizers.  The staff told us they would turn on the heaters if we got cold.  Looking at the menu, the price of the food does seem a little high for the restaurant.  It seems a little out of place, almost that it should be a little more casual of a place.  Either way, I'll head back to sit on the wonderful patio and enjoy the scenery."}
