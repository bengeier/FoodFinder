{"text":"Great fresh fruits and great choices of typical breakfast stuff. Awesome service especially the waiter Jean. He's our favourite but their waiters are nice in general. Everything tastes fresh in general"}
{"text":"\"Eat glitter for breakfast and shine all day\" or set more realistic meal goals and come to this fantastic spot.. not only is the food amazing but the feel of the restaurant with the friendly staff and spacious ambiance makes this place a great way to start your day. Always a short wait time, the owner even came outside to get us when our table was ready, rather than being money hungry and rushed to flip tables and give it to someone else-which is probably what your below average breakfast place would do considering the inexpensivness of the meals. The food was fresh and spectacular as always, the portions are large and generous. This place is a true 5 star, and no.. thats not the buzz from the classic yet tasteful mimosa speaking!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite breakfast /brunch place! Galleria offers a big variety in their meals and a great selection in their combos. This is a must visit if you're in Laval."}
{"text":"A few coworkers and I opted to have brunch at Galleria. I haven't been to Galleria in years so I didn't know what to expect. The last time I came was about 10 years ago with a very mediocre breakfast experience being the last thing I remembered. I've driven past the place for years now and I always wondered if I should give it another chance.... and I finally did!

Firstly, the place is very nice and modern. Seating is excellent and they have a big terrace. It's no dump. The service we got was friendly and efficient. When one coworker ordered something (in this case, a specific burger), they were informed it would take longer... and it did. They estimated 5 minutes longer than the rest... and it was. When he served us, he reminded her and made sure it wasn't a big deal. This was appreciated.

I went with their Combo 5 and strawberry Italian soda. I'm always a fan of Italian styled sodas but for some reason, this particular brand fell flat to me... it simply didn't taste like much. The Combo 5 plate consists of a full breakfast.... such as eggs, potatoes, banana chocolate crepe, toast, fruits and sausages. There's some variety that can be chosen if someone I mentioned doesn't suit you. The plate was very good with everything meeting and exceeding expectations. It was a very nice breakfast accompanied with solid service.

My only gripes beyond the mediocre Italian soda is that the price tag is higher than the average you'll find elsewhere. I think this can play a part since the breakfast competition in Laval was boomed in the last 10 years with new players in the game. If your price is higher than the others.... you better made sure the quality is there.

Another issue for me is that parking here is non-existent. Very small parking lot with nothing available nearby on the street. You'll find yourself parking up a block to come here an eat.... that's an issue."}
{"text":"Very nice big restaurant. The brunch was really delicious and the service was quite fast. The people was nice, and was a perfect place to eat outside on a sunny day! The parking was full but luckily we got the last empty spot. Highly recommended! Is not expensive at all and the brunch is big enough to don't eat more the rest of the day!"}
