{"text":"I had a gin martini that was made very well.  I also ordered a Bulgogi Burger which was super tasty.   Very friendly and knowledgeable staff.  The atmosphere was warm and welcoming.  I will be stopping back soon to try a blood and sand and other menu items."}
{"text":"Drink Bar and Grill  is this little treasure  hidden in Old Brooklyn.  It is a very classy place with a really laid back atmosphere.  A nice place to stop in after a hard day at work  or just want to meet up with friends 
Their menu is small  but what they have is excellent 
I've had several things but my favorite was build your own burger. This had to be the best burger I've ever had just great. The onion rings are to die for 
 They do a really good job  on their nachos as well,not your typical nachos .  They have a good selection of beers as well.  Drink is not your typical roudy kind of bar, you will never have to shout so someone can hear you, I'm sure it's not for everyone but for those looking for a laid back and classy place to relax and enjoy your evening then give Drink a try."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about this place! Great drinks, great food, great prices and great service! Come support this outstanding business!!"}
{"text":"Yesterday my husband and I were looking for a place for a good drink and some creative bar food on a night when downtown was busy because of an Indians game.  I went searching and found this bar with decent reviews of drinks and food.  When we entered we were the only ones in the place - the location may not result in consistent crowds - which is a bummer!  The drinks were great - we had Manhattans - not sweet with lots of flavor.  The bar tender was great to talk to!  We ordered chicken fingers with Thai chili sauce - so yummy as the chicken fingers were coated with a tempura batter and the dip had a nice kick!  We also tried the pork belly lettuce wrap - crispy lettuce with tasty pork and sticky rice with a nice bean sauce!  Yum!  We would like to go back to try the bulgogi burger - which sounded good too!  Hopefully this place will get a good set of regulars!  We will return!  Nice decor inside!"}
{"text":"Good food good people ,very polite and clean. Burgers are the best in town"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times now, and it has been consistently good.  Nicely curated craft taps and top notch cocktails.  Great small plates, and their entrees are super if you're looking for something more substantial.  Best in Old Brooklyn."}
{"text":"This is the type of place Old Brooklyn needs more of. It brings the ambiance of Tremont, the drinks of Velvet Tango Room, and the food of...I don't know, some good food place. 

A really wonderful spot that's easy to miss if you're not looking for it. And you SHOULD be looking for it."}
{"text":"Completely in love with this place. Stopped by on  a whim after being irritated with the over-crowded usual suspects in Tremont & Ohio City. Beautiful historic space with excellent drinks and friendly, knowledgeable staff. Stop by and have Ben make you a custom cocktail. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"We kept driving by this place, So we finally decided to stop in and eat and I'm glad we did, when you first walk in you notice how nice and laid back the place is, the colors are soothing and the music playing is a jazz / blues setting a calming mood, our beautiful hot waitress (i didnt catch her name) was very nice and full of smiles, I recommend trying the pork belly lettuce wraps for an appetizer and the Bulgogi Burger it was awesome, Overall I had a great meal at a great place!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I live pretty close to the old Theo's location (now Drink bar and grill)  on the corner of Memphis and Pearl.  We couldn't have been happier when we walked in this past saturday for drinks and a bite to eat.  We walked in and actually felt right at home, jazz playing in the background, couches to lounge on while sipping your drink, bookcases containing books that you actually would want to pick up and flip through while waiting for someone to meet you (instead of sitting at the bar clearing out your inbox) ... genius.  The staff couldn't have been nicer!
As for the food...  we had chicken tenders that were battered in tempura, followed by the chicken club quesadilla.  The sauces paired with the tenders blew my mind (specifically the sweet and sassy)...  The quesadllia was crazy good!
I am so happy that there is a nice place to go and have a drink in the neighborhood, we will definitely become regulars!..."}
{"text":"This place is like Velvet Tango Room only about 2/3 the price & they serve some real food.  Also - they have couches without rules.  It's a speak-easy, just post prohibition era inspired decor.  The drink menu has all the old fashioned drinks, made w/ high quality liquor. But if you don't like that - just ask Ben to make something special. He's always up for the task.  The beer selection is spot on too."}
{"text":"The Old Brooklyn neighborhood is lucky to have such a quality establishment. 

While not a full sit down dinner restaurant/bar, drink does manage to have an excellent food menu great for anything from a quick bite to eat to a more filling dinner. The nachos, chicken tenders, and quesadillas are arguably the best in town. The entire menu is fresh and innovatively constructed and would not be out of place at a top restaurant in tremont or east fourth street. 

The tap beer selection isn't massive, but every beer they carry is a GOOD beer. You won't find flavorless lite beers on tap, just high quality local beers with a few imports from Europe. The bottle beer list is of similar quality, plenty of good beers to explore over a few evenings. 

The cocktail menu is possibly the best part of the whole experience. Want a mixed beverage that is better quality than the Velvet Tango Room, without the pretentiousness, and a third of the price? You've found it in Drink. There is no plastic bottle vodka here just high quality spirits. If you don't see the drink you're looking for on the menu just ask because the bartender knows what he's doing. 

The ambiance is an intimate, relaxed room. A dark wood bar with warm low lighting creates a great place to hang out with friends for beverages and good conversation. The lounge areas are perfect for couples on a date, and there is pretty much no bad seat in the place. 

To sum it up if you've outgrown noisy, trashy, get wasted bars and nightclubs... Then you really need to give Drink a try. I almost forgot to add, there is tons of parking."}
{"text":"Came to this new place after reading an article about it on Scene's website.  Love the decor of the place as it does reflect something you would see in ohio city or Tremont.  We did originally sit at a table in the front of the bar and didn't get attention from anyone for about 15 mins so we moved to the bar where they were very attentive.  They may have just missed us come in.  The girl that took care of us was nice.

The food is more of tapas than entree's but they were delicious!  We shared the hummus, pork loin lettuce wraps (sauce is amazing), and onion rings.  We actually got to talk to the owner and the chef (his mother), which was great to hear how he decided to open the new place.  It's a great alternative to restaurants outside of downtown, tremont, and oh city.  

I'll be back for sure and spread the word about the place."}
{"text":"As a person who's not really into the bar/club scene, I can honestly say that Drink Bar & Grill has become a favorite establishment of mine.

When I first walked into Drink, I was utterly impressed by the atmosphere. It's not a rundown, trashy bar like most places I've been to, but rather, a classy place that invokes a feeling of nostalgia. Set up like a 1950s style jazz bar, there is something for everyone: a full bar, a seating area for those who like to eat food at a table, and sitting areas that are perfect for an intimate date with a special someone.

But one doesn't go to bars strictly for the atmosphere, but for, obviously, the drinks (and occasional food).

First, the food is simply amazing compared to typical bar food. They have your typical burgers and fries along with some special items. My favorite is the Bulgogi burger, which is Korean barbecue burger. It simply tastes excellent without feeling like you just ate a gigantic tub of grease. Other favorites of mine include the Chicken Club Quesadilla and the Casa Nachos, which are delightful takes on the usual suspects. And they do carry-out!

And then there's the actual bar selection. There's a wide assortment of cocktails, bottles, draughts, and wines for anyone's tastes, and they are not low quality drinks, even if the price suggests otherwise (Seriously, the drink prices here are a godsend compared to other bars). Now, being a man who's picky with what he drinks, I'm very skeptical about trying new drinks out, but the bartender, Ben, has a keen eye for being able to ask what you like and be able to figure out a drink you've never tried but will absolutely love. And if you still don't want to change from your usual drink, and it's not on the menu, don't worry, it will be made for you with expert skills. There's even some new drinks that the bartender has created that will blow you away.

Speaking of the staff, they are among the nicest people I've ever met in a bar. Within five minutes of talking to them, you will feel like you've known them since first grade. It will honestly feel like you've known them for years. I can't say enough good things about them.

All in all, I'm very happy to have stumbled upon this wonderful, little place and can't wait to see it grow in popularity. It may be in a part of the town you wouldn't normally frequent, but I can guarantee you will be wanting to more once you come here. Excellent food, excellent drinks, excellent atmosphere, and excellent service makes Drink a place everyone should try out at least once. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a few drinks and appetizer after going to the theater downtown. Perfect way to end date night with the husband!  Ben the bartender was courteous and efficient, and he did a great job making my drink-a real pro! This high level of dining/drinking quality and atmosphere is generally a rare occurrence in old Brooklyn and on pearl road.   This place is a wonderful find, will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Fantastic cocktails, a carefully cureated draft list of fine craft beer and awesome food! Be sure to try the bibimbap special or the lettuce wraps and bulgogie burger! Ben , Jackie the bar tender specialist are the best in town. Brian the owner is the most down to earth person I have ever known. Be sure to check it out. It is a hidden gem in NEO!"}
{"text":"I will start with I love the concept I just wish the menu was more expansive. I also like the idea of modern twist on classic cocktails. But  they seemed to be very short staffed an we went without being served for sometime. I will give it another chance and review accordingly!"}
{"text":"This is a quirky little business... try googling \"drink\" and finding this establishment after someone tells you to check it out (although we did tell management and now it seems to be first on the list for \"drink cleveland\" - thanks for listening)!  As a side note - there is tons of parking behind the business

The atmosphere is great.  It sort of reminds you of a place you would hang out for hours... like a coffee shop with alcohol and darker decor.  There are couches along one edge of the bar that are primed late night chats with good friends.  Lots of space around the central bar to sit and chat up the bartender.  Tons of other tables are scattered throughout the space.

Bartender Ben is the highlight of the bar.  He really believes in his craft and his drinks, he takes great pride in giving the customer exactly what they want.  He is incredibly inviting, and willing to sit down with you when the bar is on the quiet side.  

This cozy little establishment is great for a date night, or for catching up with friends.  The beverages are solid and well priced, $9-15 for a cocktail, $4-8 for a beer, $7-10 for a glass of wine.  Happy hours takes $1 off beer, $2 off wine, and $3 off cocktails with a few $5 appetizers.  We tried both the $10 calamari and $6 cheesecake, neither were particularly memorable."}
{"text":"Beautiful atmosphere, wonderful food, & even better drinks! Drink is a hidden gem that should be experienced by all, their experienced mixologists and craft beers will keep you coming back time & time again. Thank you Drink!!"}
{"text":"This place has a nice relaxed vibe. I love that it's a place you can walk into and have a conversation with anyone at the bar. I went for the Bulgobi burger and will keep coming back. It's amazing. The patty on this thing is so well seasoned you can taste the love. I seriously almost re-upped and ordered a second because I inhaled the first one. It was moist, and flavorful. Not like most burgers you'll find around. You just have to try it. No words to describe it. Should have sent a poet."}
{"text":"Our bartender was GREAT! He read all of our drink styles and made great suggestions. Very cool place. Definitely a gem. Didn't try the food. That's the only reason it didn't get a 5."}
{"text":"Tonight was my second visit to Drink, and I was looking forward to trying the Bulgogi Burger again to see if maybe I was just imagining how good it was. I was not disappointed. It is the best burger I have ever eaten.  The menu is very limited, but  the flavors are very good."}
{"text":"You have to try this place. I rode past many times over the past few months with the intent to stop by. I'm so glad I finally went. When I went to park I almost left because it looked closed. But luckily they were not. This place is so perfect for a date. The ambiance is absolutely perfect. The food was delicious and the drinks were great! The bartender was awesome! I am definitely going back!"}
{"text":"One of the best lounge type bars I've had the pleasure to frequent. Feel lucky it is here in old Brooklyn. The bartenders are friendly and haven't had a bad service experience. Tried some of the food, the bulgogi burger is amazing. Cooked perfectly and incredibly flavorful. Can't wait to try more of the menu. Started coming here last year and always find myself here when I'm thirsty. Great music, not a lot of televisions,  just enough to watch a game, not having cable. Love this place."}
{"text":"We finally tried Drink last night for dinner.  Living in Old Brooklyn, we are thrilled it's down the street.  The tempura chicken finger appetizer was great- crisp, flavorful and no \"funny chicken\" moments during any bite.  The bruschetta was also very good.  The chef came out to tell us they are experimenting in their garden with purple basil which topped the tomato salad.  I'm a big bruschetta fan and the purple basil was more fragrant and earthly than your regular basil which was a nice touch.  It was also cool that the chef took the time to share.  For dinner, I had the steak quesadillas.  These aren't your sports bar giant size mediocre quesadillas.  The portion size was just right, the presentation was nice, and there was bacon involved.  Enough said.  : )  For dessert, we tried the cheesecake which was a solid ending.  We tried a few of their cocktails, which were good.  I think they'd be more appealing at $7 rather than $9, however, during happy hour they are $6, so that's easily doable.  The ambiance at Drink is relaxing- dark hard wood, red walls and accents along with couches to sip your cocktails on.  It was relatively empty on a Wednesday night, service was good.  We will definitely be back, want to see what the weekend looks like at Drink and we also want to try out their happy hour.  In any case, if you want a nice alternative to W.25th, not wall to wall people, good food and good drinks, definitely check it out."}
{"text":"Ben, Brian, Momma Kim and Nicole are awesome! I was there tonight and joked with Ben that he had to make me a drink he thought I would like and that the kitchen should surprise me with a snack. Well, Ben made me a Ward 13 which was great and Brian made me Spicy Bacon Pasta a not on the menu special that he had not made in months. It was fantastic! I would have been happy if I had gotten some nuts or chips and dip, but Brian went out of his way to make me a great dish! Everyone is friendly and willing to sit and talk to customers and they make you feel very comfortable. Also Ben has been trying to get a particular beer I requested on tap. This place is great and you must come in and meet Ben, Brian, Kim and Nicole. You will have a fun time and recommend Drink to all your friends. Thanks folks. Cheers!"}
{"text":"There's no reason to fight for a parking space or wait for a table at some new place in Ohio City or Tremont. Just cruise on into the parking lot behind the CVS, walk into Drink and you'll just be able to enjoy the food, drinks and smooth, upscale lounge feel the owner (Brian) has built. He said he wanted to create a place he'd enjoy spending 18 hours a day in -- he certainly succeeded! 

The decor would fit into any top of the line club: dark wood, lounging nooks, high top tables and the central bar with bottle display- lit from below with color changing lights.

Everyone in our group enjoyed their food. I had the West Coast Wrap with a side salad. This was not the hard on the edges, spongy in the middle, chicken-from-a-bag you get at some bars that serve food. The chicken was pan-seared, tender and really delicious. The rest of the wrap included fresh hummus, basil, lemon, blue cheese and some tomato & onion. The salad was fresh, with a stunningly red roma tomato sectioned on top, a house blueberry vinagrette - and came with the perfect extra dusting of blue cheese I requested.

I'm looking forward to coming back to explore Brian's take on hand crafting traditional cocktails. The beer selections run the gamut from bottles including Pabst and Ommegang Philospher's to $3 Yeungling drafts. So there's something for everyone at the bar.

They've only been open since late March - so their clientele is still finding their way to Drink. But their customers are out there - wishing for just this kind of place in Old Brooklyn. Stop wishing ... Brian built Drink just for you (and himself)."}
{"text":"Wings and fries took a half hour to come out and it was the only kitchen order. When I asked why it took a long time the bartender responded that everything is made fresh. Seriously?"}
{"text":"This review marks our second visit to Drink in about 7 months. Our first visit was within two weeks of their opening and, if you read my initial review, you know that my wife and I were pleasantly surprised. We really liked the grown-up feel, the darkly lit, loungy atmosphere complete with cozy couched niches, and Rat Pack-esque soundtrack. We delighted in the concise yet interesting menu of tasty bar bites and small plates peppered with tastes of the owners' Asian roots. Our latest visit, around 6pm on a Saturday, was nearly a repeat of our first experience - friendly, attentive bar service, tasty food and inviting ambiance. Alas, I remain torn. Why the inner conflict, you may ask? Unfortunately, I'm left grasping lazily at cliché. Drink, it's not you, it's me. 

At its core, Drink is a bar. Sure, they've got some tasty items upon which to nosh while enjoying your Moscow Mule (if that's your thing) but their soul screams \"relax in my nooks and crannies and drink another $12 cocktail\". Therein lies the rub for me. I'm a restaurant guy. I no longer have the desire to over-indulge in potent potables and I'm not drawn to mixology and cleverly concocted libations, not that there's anything wrong with them. It's just that when my wife and I go out we go out to eat. For us, it's all about the food. We revel in the total dining experience with its seasonal menus, unique ingredients and let-us-spoil-you staff. So for us, Drink will probably remain an infrequent diversion between restaurant visits, a back-up when our plans fall through or a close-to-home fallback.

Like I said, I do like you Drink, I really do. We can still be friends. Not the kind of friends that connect deeply at some nearly uncomfortable, spiritual level, but the kind of friends that just happen to bump into each other occasionally. But that's not to say that Drink might not be your soulmate. If you're looking for a neighborhood place that's comfortable without being lazy and classy without being pretentious, Drink is your spot. If your idea of a great night out is sipping Manhattans or lingering over expensive scotch, you'll be in heaven. It's just not my thing, well, at least not my regular thing.

Before I go, I do want to update you on the goodies we sampled during this most recent visit. The menu may be short but there are some hidden gems:

Onion rings - If you've got an o-ring craving these should scratch your itch. Battered and not breaded and some nearly six inches in diameter, these are some serious rings. Fried a golden brown, the batter was well-seasoned and crispy and the onions addictively sweet.

House salad - Nothing to get your loins giddy with this one. A mixture of sweet butter lettuce and Romaine, a few slices of cuke and some tomato wedges. It was fresh enough but the vinaigrette served on the side was unmixed and separated. 

Pork belly lettuce wraps - I wish I could eat these every day. Crispy Romaine lettuce canoes filled with a thin slice of salty pork belly topped with sticky white rice, fermented red bean paste and scallions. Textural balance and a perfect combination of salty, sweet and heat. I highly recommend this dish.

Chicken tenders - These have changed since our last visit and not for the better. Gone is the light, tempura coating that gently enrobed the white meat breast strips. The current batter is much thicker, very similar to the onion ring coating and, for whatever reason, the meat had a texture reminiscent of a certain McNugget. I was also a bit turned off by the strange, tubular shapes. They looked like battered worms. Just not as good as they used to be. The sweet and sassy sauce (sriracha and mayo?) is still tasty and I could eat it on everything.

Bulgogi burger - This burger was a revelation. The soft brioche bun was happy to play a role in the supporting cast while the meat, tender and drip-on-the-plate juicy, played the lead. Kudos to the kitchen for nailing the perfect medium. The toppings were also delicious. I loved the flavor combination of the hoisin mayo and the pickled daikon radish slices. It's a melee of flavors and they all work. The fries that accompanied the burger were much improved since our last visit. Crispy, perfectly seasoned and skin-on."}
{"text":"First off, the ambiance is amazing! You're surrounded by books and serenaded by Buble, Sinatra and more. The TVs all play classic black and white shows and the bar offers delicious drinks. I absolutely loved the quesadilla, filled with chicken and cheese and topped with sour cream and scallions. It really hit the spot and I ended up finishing the entire plate. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This
Place
Is 
AWESOME!!!!!!

Date night before the Motocycle show and I do not really know where to start, you walk in from the ample parking lot and the sound of swing rock you around the bar so be sure to get a good look at where you want to sit because there are options!!!  If you want a bit of privacy there are quaint little nooks for dinner and quiet conversation as well as a wraparound bar if you pop in on your own feeling a bit peckish! 
There are nooks with couches to just enjoy a cocktail with conversation or tables more in the open so as to generate conversation with the bar or other patrons because I can garantee you there is a buzz in the air here...
I can go on but more importantly YOU need to pop in some evening and see what I saw...
A classy little gem in my stomping grounds in Old Brooklyn!!!

Oh...Btw...Parking in rear of building that is WAY close to back entrance is SUCH a bonus..."}
{"text":"3.5 and a close 4.0. I had a good time. They make good drinks, and the staff were friendly. Unfortunately I went on Easter Saturday, and there just wasn't anyone there. 

I love the atmosphere (or should I say the \"would be\" atmosphere). Kinda cool bar, with 1940s crooners playing through the system. A couple of lounge areas with couches (not my thing, but...), a few high tops, black-and-white movies playing on the tvs. 

I'll definitely go back. I like the cocktail bar idea, and the classy vibe they're trying to promote. I'm sure it will be a better experience with a larger crowd. I'll update my review once I've had the full experience."}
{"text":"I was seriously blown away with the interior and decor when I first walked in. The pics people took are great but you need to see it firsthand. I will say I didn't eat but I did drink.....heavily. Had a perfectly made Moscow Mule. No copper cup but who cares? Had a spicy martini and that was equally good.  The bartender was great and talked when he could. The menu looked great but will try it soon and update. Places like this are why we all should dress up and head out for a night on the town. A first class establishment"}
{"text":"I happened to pass by this place on my way to school. Once I got to school, I googled it, saw the first review, and decided to stop in that night. I was not sorry at all. 
When I walked in, I was afraid I might have been a bit under dressed, but it didn't end up being an issue. The very awesome bartender with the Betsy Johnson scarf kept me in pleasant conversation as she made me a Sidecar. Ice cold, sugar rim- it was fantabulous. The atmosphere was wonderful- dim but not too dark, candles everywhere, the smooshy couches and the shelves of books- plus the jazz playing in the background. It was good jazz, not crap jazz, so good in fact that I never even touched the jukebox on the wall. This is very strange behavior on my part. I always love playing jukebox DJ, but it never even occurred to me that night. 
As for food, I tried the chicken tenders. They were fried in tempura, and the sauce choices were wonderful. The couple a few stools over (the woman from the first review and her boyfriend) and I ended up sharing appetizers. They got the quesadillas and the nachos, which were both delicious. They all looked amazing, too. You can tell presentation is important to the owner and the staff. 
I love this place, I will go back. Often."}
{"text":"I live half a mile away from Drink, and I think its the nicest bar/restaurant in the area. Its clean, decorated nicely, plays jazz, is dimly lit, has a nice waitstaff, and the food has been consistently good and reasonably priced every time I visit. Whenever someone wants to have a casual dinner or go to a bar some place by me, I pick Drink or else I end up in Tremont.

I especially like their hummus (its better than most hummus I've had in my life, and that's A LOT of hummus), and their Bulgogi burger. 

Also, Theresa is a really nice server who is careful to remember your name and take good care of you."}
{"text":"Don't tell anyone about this place.  It has a great atmosphere, like a speak easy.  Black and white movie playing on the TVs.  Big bar and private booths.  Large beer selection and craft drinks.  I had the burger (korean bbq burger) and it was fantastic.  On a Wednesday at 5pm the bartender was the only server, so sitting at the bar gets you faster attention. When people discover this place, it will be packed.  Don't tell anyone."}
{"text":"Coming from Scottsdale, AZ, known for its upscale, snooty bar scene, my expectations of bars in Cleveland weren't that high. However, Drink. Bar & Grill totally put me in my place.  The inside of the bar was classier than most places I've been and the cocktail selection was pretty great as well.  

After a weekend of binge drinking with old college friends down at Ohio State, I was looking for something more refreshing and less sweet, and that's pretty much what I told the bartender on duty, Ben. I also threw out there that I wanted something with cucumber and vodka. A few minutes later, he brings to me a delicious cucumber inspired cocktail. I totally approve of this.

The menu has several items on there that I would've loved to try, but I was running late on time. I heard amazing things about the Korean-inspired bulgogi burger, but I went for something a little quicker to eat - a chicken quesadilla. The sriracha sauce on the quesadilla totally made it stand out from those served elsewhere.

I'll definitely be returning to Drink. the next time I'm in town. Thanks a lot, Ben & Brian for the awesome experience!"}
{"text":"The bartender was phenomenal, and he really took the time to get to know his customers. He put so much heart and work into his drinks which you really don't see anymore. First impression was definitely a great one."}
{"text":"Toto, we're not in Old Brooklyn anymore. 

Who would have known such an awesome, classy yet casual little joint could exist in Old Brooklyn. You get the typical warm, friendly people you expect from a typical OB dive bar, but a quaint and upscale atmosphere that is reminiscent of a hipster bar in Tremont (but 86 the pretentious hipsters). How perfect!!!

They have a GREAT craft beer selection and oh my god the food. I got the Bugogi Burger, and I'm not sure I've ever had a better burger in my life. 

Our bartender, Ben, was great too! Friendly and accommodating but not in a \"I'm being nice because I want you to tip me\" way at all, but in a genuine way. 

Considering this place is not only amazing, but also maybe a little less than a 1/2 mile  from our house, we will be back. Lots and lots and lots."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere beautiful setting. Great intimate place to spend a quiet evening or have a relaxing time with friends!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing great drinks and couches. And Megan the bartender just told me she is awesome. I agree"}
{"text":"So exciting to see a beautifully designed new bar and grill in Old Brooklyn! They did an amazing job transforming the place into a relaxing yet sophisticated spot to hang out with friends. I have been for lunch and after work plus attended their grand opening where they had a live jazz  band. My understanding is that they will continue with live music at times. The food was excellent. I had a pasta special for lunch a simple but very tasty garlic and oil with fresh vegtables. I have also had their spring salad with chicken with their home made cranberry vinegrete. The dressing is hand made from fresh cranberries! Their is a good selection of wines by the glass and beer but their cool bar has great speciality selections too. Their is an Asian flare to some of the food selections with a Korean style burger. Located on Pearl Road right next to the CVS and their is FREE parking in the back with an easy back door entrance. Look forward to seeing this place be succesful!"}
{"text":"My sister-in-law is a big fan of Drink, and I had been wanting to try it when I was in Cleveland next. My husband and I snuck away from the family for a date night over the holidays, and our first stop was cocktails at Drink. The bartender was extremely personable and friendly. The cocktail list is a decent size, and there were plenty of unique cocktails to choose from. My husband had an Aviation, and and I had Ward 13. His cocktail was definitely the more complex of the two. We enjoyed our cocktails cozied up on one of the couches by candlelight. The interior is definitely not expected from the outside, which was a pleasant surprise. Overall, we enjoyed our excellently crafted cocktails and would be back sooner if we lived in town."}
{"text":"Place was definitely nice and clean.  The kind of lounge I would bring my friends to chill and drink on the couch.  Loved the jazz music being played.  Bulgogi burger was absolutely juicy and bursting with flavor in every bite.  Also ordered the Pork Belly for appetizer which was delicious too but a bit on the salty side for me.  But since I ordered the Fat Head Blueberry beer it was just an amazing combination.  Will definitely recommend this place to friends."}
{"text":"After a dozen visits and converting my siblings, many friends and acquaintances, I'm still a believer of Drink. 

The service has continued to be excellent and the food has been a pleasant surprise. The onion rings were quite large, homemade, and had a nice spicy tempura batter. These were not typical bar onion rings. 

They still get the little things right: bringing a water to you as soon as you sit down and refilling water or your non alcoholic beverage without asking - I really appreciate this. 'Classier' places in Tremont and West 25th in the OC, aren't doing this as much as they used to - forgetting why they're classier in the first place - because they did the little things like this (along with the nicer beers, atmospheres, clientele, etc). 

Jazz, ragtime, or old blues (pre-60s) in the backgrounds, TV's will occasionally have sports [no sound] played in the background and aren't the focus here. 

Their beer selections have not disappointed me as Brian keeps a nice rotation of very so often and bringing things that I can't drink anywhere else in Old Brooklyn, like dogfish pumpkin ale and nosferatu at expected prices (5-5.50 for the micro drafts). 

The only thing I could ask is a few others to join me and friends some times."}
{"text":"Need to mull over a job offer with a stiff drink?
Fancy a chat with the world's most interesting bartender?

Or just want a taste of how drinks should actually be crafted?

Its no question that the answer is Drinks bar and grill."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in Old Brooklyn. Really lovely decor and layout, not loud, great bartender, very good drinks list and a great menu. I had two glasses of Apothic Red (very smooth) and a mixed drink that tasted like sweet tarts. Personally,  I wouldn't order the drink again, but that it nothing against the drink itself. I just enjoyed the wine a bit more. I had the hummus appetizer. It was perfect - better than Aladdins.  I also had the Korean BBQ burger. OMG! A combination of flavors that totally works. No wonder it is their feature item. Go. You will love it. Happy Hour is from 4-6pm and they have $5 appetizers and wine, beer, and mixed drink specials. Seriously - go now!"}
{"text":"What a great find.

Tucked away in the Old Brooklyn/Parma area sits a cozy classy restaurant called Drink.

I had heard lots about this place- I had heard that there are Korean influences that are infused in the menu, plus I tried their food recently at an event. When asked where to go to dinner tonight, I told him \"Drink!\"

Walking into the restaurant surprised me. It's a classy cozy restaurant. The bar is I. The center, with cubbies of couches with tables, in which you can eat at. I was afraid that even the couches would be dirty.. Nope, super clean. I felt at ease when we sunk down on the couch, ready to eat.

We ordered first, a plate of pork belly lettuce wraps. Delicious-with just the right mix of flavors and the pork belly was SO good. I ordered the bulgogi burger-marinated well, and it had such great flavor. He ordered the casa nachos- also a great dish!

The chill atmosphere , the great waitstaff (kind and patient) and the food made a great night. I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick drink after work with co workers. I have been driving by this place for awhile and have been wanting to check it out as the outside looks really cute and is settled into an interesting part of Old Brooklyn. What a charming establishment! The drinks were made really well and the bartender was very well versed in the cocktails. A bit pricey but it was very good. My friend ordered the hummus which was also delicious. I would recommend coming in even for just one."}
{"text":"Drink is your corner bar, with a twist!! The staff are incredibly friendly and know their cocktails!! If you sit at the bar, prepare to make friends because this is a neighborhood joint. I've only eaten at Drink a few times and it's fine (just a bit overpriced bar food trying to be fancy), but that's not why I go to Drink. I go for the happy hour, the negroni, and the company. Try it out, there's never a crowd...but there should be!"}
{"text":"Just like the other reviews, almost want to keep it for ourselves.  Drink bar & grill old brooklyn 4250 pearl rd 44109, Amazing place.  Nice parking in rear connected to the CVS.  Really great decor, comfy bar, couches niches, dining tables.  Adult music, and the food!  We enjoyed the meat and cheese tray, fried risotto balls with pesto, chicken club quesadilla, and OMG  spicey pork belly lettuce wraps to dream about, and chicken wings. Creative and tasty dishes, along with fun and talented bartender.  Highly recommend this bar and grill to any one who loves good food, drink, music, relaxation, and  a super staff who will go out of their way to make you smile !!   Thanks to all at Drink, we will return with a crowd !!!"}
{"text":"Came by myself as a treat. Nobody was there so it was quick and private. Really funny bar tender. Good drinks. Nice and dark in the bar. Sexy and intimate... lots of couches and private spots. Food was fast and quite good. Main complaint was the happy hour wasn't cheap. Would probably come back for a date."}
{"text":"Sometimes life hits you hard, leaving you in chaos for weeks upon weeks, making you feel like maybe your friends no longer care about you, making you feel like nothing will get better, making you feel completely isolated from the world around you. 

When this happened, and oh how it did, I had to reach out to a friend who has known me for decades. This preamble may seem excessive, but I found myself at Drink out of necessity, and Drink delivered exactly what I needed. 

As I drove to Drink for the first time, I was worried that it would be like all of the other Brooklyn townie bars that I passed on my way: flashing neon in the windows illuminating the haze from smokers, Bud Light on tap and PBR in cans, a slight stickiness to the bar. I'm not saying there's anything wrong with townie bars, but I didn't need a townie bar. Drink was what I needed: quiet and classy with a high-shine 360 bar gleaming in the middle of the room, nooks and crannies for private conversations, and local brews on tap. The light was dim, and the music was mellow enough that I don't even remember it (was there music?). 

I spent at least two hours sipping on a deep, dark, rich, chocolately Mexican porters and sharing conversation. The bartender was friendly and chatty, explaining what they had one tap and offering suggestions, but let us have our privacy when we needed it, and we clearly did: we stayed near to closing time. 

I look forward to coming back to Drink, though ideally in higher spirits, to try more of their beers, sample the food (didn't get to try it my first time), and soak up the relaxing ambiance. This place is truly a diamond in the rough."}
{"text":"We stopped in last night for cocktails for the first time.  We were immediately amazed at how cool and welcoming the interior actually was.  The owners did an incredible job at decorating the bar.  The colors are rich, actual candles burning, book shelves and books, intimate seating areas, etc.  The staff were very attentive to detail provided excellent service.  We decided to order a cheese and meat plate.  The quality was just as good as what we've come to expect from a establishment in Ohio City....but this is Old Brooklyn!  The skills of the bar staff were top notch, resulting in superior quality cocktails.  I know this establishment is referred to as a \"bar and grill\", but once you experience the visual ambiance together with the Jazz music playing in the background, you will see it is definitely more like a classy cocktail lounge.  This place is one of those amazing \"undiscovered\" secret spots.  I'm sure once more people experience how great it is, the crowds will begin to form.  There is plenty of parking behind the building.  There is a back door to enter through, if you parked behind the building.  You've got to experience this gem for yourself, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is an absolute GEM. As per usual, would have never discovered this place had it not been for Yelp. That being said, the SO and I were in the mood for a low key date night, and decided choosing this place since it's close to home. You could easily drive past this place without noticing it, but I will note that there is ample parking behind the building! 

When we got inside, I was surprised to find that the space was more... intimate than I imagined it would be? I usually prefer sitting up at the bar, and I was happy to find that there were plenty of spots available even at Friday night dinner hour. There were also a lot of little \"nooks\" where you could grab a table if you had a somewhat larger group... definitely a casual yet sophisticated lounge feel. My only complaint here was that it was a little bit \"too\" quiet for a Friday night, but I think that's just because of the lounge atmosphere they wanted to convey, it didn't dampen the overall casual feel of the place, and of course, it makes it easier to have a conversation not having to shout over bar noise. 

The bartender greeted us right away, and another gentleman took the opportunity to talk beer geekery with us (perhaps the owner?). They had a small, yet impressive craft beer selection, as well as a nice array of cocktails to choose from. We ordered our drinks (double IPA and a Moscow Mule) as well as dinner (bulgogi burger with fries and a cheeseburger with onion rings) Having spent a semester abroad in S.Korea, I was really pleased to find that they had bulgogi burgers listed on the menu and we were not disappointed...both of the burgers were fantastic; served on a brioche style bun, bursting with flavor, juicy, and well-sized. The onion rings were also deliciously crispy and delightful. All in all we were really impressed with the total package here- ambiance, service, drinks, food. Will most definitely be back...Soon!"}
