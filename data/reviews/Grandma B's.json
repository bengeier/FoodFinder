{"text":"Truly, the best breakfast in Pittsburgh and has everything a great diner needs: great food and good people. Remember to bring cash"}
{"text":"Great food. Everything I had in a two day visit has been great! Love the French toast, pancakes, shrimp and grits, beef bacon, beef sausage....EVERYTHING is good. Dependable good cookin'!"}
{"text":"Took the family after reading a write-up in the NY Times (https://nyti.ms/2vz6aOw) for lunch yesterday.  GB's in seven years appears to have become a neighborhood institution.  Dorian, the owner, seems to know everyone who comes in the door and those who are hanging around outside.  I feel like he will remember us when we return and ask about how school is going for my son.   The place is narrow, with a counter extending to the back and a few two tops (so seating for a dozen or so).  We went for a late lunch on a Wednesday and didn't have to wait to sit at the the counter (although another patron nicely moved to make room for the four of us).  We sat in front of the grill and talked with Dorian through most of our meal.  His younger brother and one other helper make the place run smoothly.  We ordered at Dorian's suggestion: Al's Special (eggs, french toast, potatoes and bacon), Steak and Eggs (the sauce on the steak was delicious), fish sandwich with fries, and a sort of poutine (shredded chicken, cheese, Dorian's sauce).  We finished everything.  The steak and eggs was our favorite.    Dorian is the star here, knowing his customers and making them his friends.  He told my son, who is attending graduate school at CMU, to come with any problems he has and Dorian will help sort them out.  Really nice experience."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Pittsburgh! French toast and grits were delicious. Great, friendly, and quick service."}
{"text":"Amazing. I sat at the bar, so I ended up leaving the place smelling of food, but I didn't even care. Everything was well made and prepared right in front of us. The staff is also very friendly, and it is clear that this restaurant has been an important part of the community for a long time. It's cash only so be prepared for that. I would recommend 100%"}
{"text":"Flat out point blank bottom line period the food is bomb quit playing & go grab you a plate of something"}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast place! The area feels safe. Family like atmosphere. The Owner/Chef works so hard to make sure the service and food is always of quality! Check them out! I get Dirty Grits and Steak or a chicken loaded A++"}
{"text":"This place is RIDICULOUSLY GOOD. I got eggs, pancakes and French toast. YUM!  And the owner is super nice."}
{"text":"Truly tasted like I was in someone's home. The home of someone who knows how to burn! The food was really good! No ambiance necessary when the meal is done right."}
{"text":"What's not to say. Great food. Great service. Worlds best tea!!! Don't pass up the chance to go if you are in the Hill District or anywhere near PPG Paints arena!"}
{"text":"I just moved to Pittsburgh a day or two ago and didn't have any food in my fridge. I was looking at Yelp for some brunch places and this one was one I  came across that happened to be open the day after Xmas!! I AM SO GLAD I SAW THIS! Honestly, I've never been to a place where the people and the food were amazing but this place just blew my mind. Not only are the employees and the owner awesome as hell, but the customers were chill too! Now the food.....One word: HEAVEN. Ughhh if only I lived a little closer to this place! Thankfully I'll be around the area a lot, so I'll definitely bring some cash with me and stop by as frequently as I can! 5/5 stars all day, errday for Grandma B's"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a no frills place w/ good food., this is the spot. I'm talking zero frills. If you sit at the bar, you're watching them make your food on the spot. The cook is cool and he'll talk to you while he makes your stuff. Good people and good food is all I can say. Any meal of the day."}
{"text":"After breakfast, I was already planning when I would return for lunch because the food is just so good. Between us we had the French toast, the fish sandwich, the veggie omelette, home fries and grits and no one in our party of six left disappointed. This is definitely not going to be your classic restaurant experience. It's a very tight space with a couple larger tables in the back and a good amount of bar stools. Beverages are bottle service only so if you sit for a while just plan to make a purchase. It's not a big deal though because the price is absolutely right! There is little on the menu that will cost you over $10 and that is even after tax. It's definitely a good hidden gem if you are just outside of downtown or looking to sneak away from the hustle and bustle as a group of one or two."}
{"text":"This neighborhood breakfast/lunch spot is perfect in every way. The food is delicious, but the charm comes from the cook and his banter with the regulars and his co-workers. I had the Philly cheese steak and it was the best I've had. Chopped up steak, onions and cheese on a roll with lettuce, tomato, and mayo. Delicious! Go here if you want great eats in a truly welcoming atomosphere."}
{"text":"GRANDMA B's on The Hill  What a friendly place.  The four of us had finished our August Wilson Tour of his Hill District haunts, hangouts and mentions in his Pittsburgh Cycle of 10 plays.  We wanted something light to eat and had heard of Grandma B's from a web search. We were not disappointed.  We had arrived at a busy time for this bustling halal eatery at 2537 Wylie Ave. but a friendly greeting and a quickly assembled table for four put us at ease.  We were in the back, overlooking the small counter and food prep area. Service was quick, pleasant and welcoming.  We ordered from the simple menu: I had a turkey club with fries, my wife  had a fish salad [not on menu but our waiter suggested it would be OK], our two friends opted to share the \"monster fish sandwich\" [which is enough for 2].  Folks, this is simple food inexpensively priced and served simply.  We all cleaned our plates 'cause the platters were tasty!"}
{"text":"Stopped in the place with some friends from town, they have really good food, great atmosphere, &friendly service. The cook made small talk with my husband & I and made us feel comfortable while we waited. We will defiantly be back to try the steak & cheese fries."}
{"text":"Bar none the best breakfast in Pittsburgh. I know of no other place where you can get the quantity and quality of food available from Grandma B's.  Get the monster fish sandwich!"}
{"text":"Every time I stop in it's \"Hey Aliquippa!!!\" with warm smiles! I love this place, for a quick bite to eat and good conversations. Food made right in front of you.  I'm a fan of the fish and grits that come with eggs. Made just how I like them."}
{"text":"Fire. Fyre .  FUEGOOOO. So good  CASH ONLY  I got the French toast, cheesy eggs and bacon combo. I'm usually really picky about French toast.. this was really good.   The place is very tiny, but well worth it! The employees there were welcoming and nice to talk to.  Looking forward to Visiting again!!"}
{"text":"I'm from California and was in Pittsburgh for less than 24 hours to meet some people.  If I can't go to Philly might as well settle for something in Pittsburgh!  Please see my attached photos.  I bought 2 Philly Cheese steaks and they were AMAZING!    I don't know what kind of fries he uses but they were fantastic.  I ate half of one and took the remainder back on the plane with me....IN MY CARRY ON!!!  The staff was friendly as well.  Bad neighborhood?  I don't think so, come to they Bay Area and I can show you bad neighborhoods.  It was safe enough for me, a Central Asian, to go in, have my order freshly prepared and leave my uninsured rental car outside.  FYI:  The place is closed Friday 1-2:30pm (or was it 2:15, I can't remember)."}
{"text":"It was nice to find a black owned establishment providing great food and customer service in the Hill District!"}
{"text":"I've frequented this place on several occasions. The food is consistently amazing. The staff is always nice and respectful. I'd recommend this place to anyone!! Keep up the good work fellas."}
{"text":"Breakfast is cooked to order. The food is delicious. The place is very small, so if there is not a seat at the counter, they will pack it to go. I was visiting the area, and frequented it almost every day. Will not disappoint."}
{"text":"Absolutely, a four and a half star restaurant.  Grandma B's is the best diner in Pittsburgh. I ordered French toast with beef sausage which was good. Though the highlight of the meal was certainly the Philly cheesesteak my friend ordered. It was the best cheesesteak that I've ever tried. I highly recommend ordering the cheesesteak for your first meal here. I take full responsibility if you don't find the cheesesteak to be outstanding."}
{"text":"If you're looking for the classic eggs, toast and bacon breakfast, this is your place. Grandma Bs is a small family owned restaurant that had delicious food at reasonable prices. I will definitely return again for breakfast, as it is the closest place to Oakland that has a great classic breakfast without the crowds of the other locations."}
{"text":"Mom and pop stop - cheap, good and affordable, but they do not take credit card as stated on their Yelp page."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for breakfast and I didn't eat pork so this is ideal the food is good keep up the good work try the fish and grits"}
{"text":"Grandma B's is a pretty small restaurant, but a lot of people either come alone or with a friend/significant other. They also have a couple larger tables toward the back of the restaurant that seat around 4 people each.  My boyfriend and I shared a Philly cheesesteak with fries and a breakfast plate with pancakes, sausage, potatoes, and an egg. Their Philly cheesesteak by default came with a few toppings that aren't normally on a Philly cheesesteak (lettuce, tomatoes, mayo). I personally thought this made the cheesesteak better, but my boyfriend didn't agree and took them off. Fries were delicious. The sausage on the breakfast plate seemed overcooked and the egg was definitely overfried. The pancakes and potatoes were fine.   Although I wish our food came out faster (took about 25 minutes total), the kindness of the owners made up for it.   Taste | 3.5-4 Atmosphere | 3 Presentation | 3 Service | 3.5 OVERALL | 3.5-4"}
{"text":"Super nice people and the breakfast was really great! The guy was so cool he made me one French toast, and one pancake so I could try both!! You could go to another place but I doubt you'll find a better breakfast in the burgh even from a five star hotel. If the Crawford Grill was still there I'd move to the hill district and try to find a house in walking distance to both places!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped at Grandma B's to grab a quick breakfast on my way to an appointment.  Ordered a bacon, egg & cheese breakfast sandwich on wheat.   The food was cooked fresh while I waited.  I chatted with other customers and the cooks.  The atmosphere was pleasant and friendly.  The sandwich was good, even though they don't cook pork products.  I'd never had beef bacon before, but was pleasantly surprised.  I will most definitely be going back there again!  It pays to give the little guy a chance.  I was happy!!"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful breakfast. Especially liked the dirty grits. Staff very friendly. Will go back again."}
{"text":"I love their chicken clubs with their secret sauce. I could eat that everyday swear. It's nothing I've ever tasted before. Keep up the good work"}
