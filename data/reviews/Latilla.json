{"text":"The management thanked me profusely for my input on Yelp and graciously invited me to return as a guest to show me the true Latilla Experience. I was told changes have been made because of reading my YELP review.The changes are that dinner portions are more ample than before, the appetizer plate share charge is gone now and I noticed the web site has been updated. This visit showed little resemblance to the service I had last time. A full staff was on with staff working in sync as a team with all the tables not just mine.  I was even more blown away with the food than the last time due to perhaps I picked foods that were more suiting to me some highs were-  Beet salad- it was similar to others I had in other places but this one also had HOUSE GROWN BEETS ,Riesling soaked pears and the toasted hazelnuts made the salad  pop with flavor.   Foraged mushroom rissotto-correctally made with a depth of flavor, it was good on it's own but this had an added embellishment of a SIXTY TWO DEGREE duck egg.   Nicely seasoned and prepared fresh branzino sat on top of ribbon cut caponata, an unusual surprise was the vinaigrette and the ribbon cut string less celery that was very good.   We also enjoyed the Kobe Flap steak with wine reduction and tiny marble size multi color potatoes and tasty spinach.  Since we skipped the interesting desserts last time we had to try one this time and tried the chocolate hazelnut cake with jam-figs and mascarpone gelato this dessert was garnished with a chocolate sort of lavender crisp and roasted hazelnuts. This dessert was something Iron chef worthy for sure with all the flavors working well together.  The service we had was phenomenal.  The food at Latilla is masterfully done, the surroundings are majestic and breathtaking. The meal we had wasn't ordinary it was extraordinary!"}
{"text":"This is the main dining room at the Boulders resort.  I was seated in the front seating area where the walls are cream colored, with tall picture windows that give you a dramatic view of the boulders.    I was surprised at the relative short, simple menu.  But looking around at the mostly 45+ out-of-town diners, and knowing that most Phoenix restaurants aspire to \"haute cuisine\" but don't execute it very well, the menu of mostly grilled protein and easily identifiable sides (potatoes, leeks, green peas etc) was spot on.  As an appetizer I had the soft shell crab and it was surprisingly good!  Not greasy.  Not salty.  Just crispy goodness.  The salad was tossed with just a hint of basil dressing.  Not your standard salad drowning in dressing.  I fully expected everything to be a la carte, but if you order the filet mignon, the sauce, and 2 sides are included in the price!  The 5 oz filet mignon was surprisingly affordable for a resort restaurant.  The dessert was very impressive.  Once again, if you like super sweet desserts, this is NOT for you.  If you're the kind of diner who thinks most Phoenix restaurants are flavored just right, then you'll find the meal at Latilla lacking in flavor.  But if you're a diner who's looking for subtle flavors, and \"smaller\" portions, then Latilla is a restaurant worth driving out to Carefree to try."}
{"text":"The Boulders is the premiere resort in the Scottsdale area.  The Latilla Room offers wonderful food with human sized portions - a rarity in Cowboy land.  Also the wine list is extraordinary & offers good value."}
{"text":"Latilla SHOULD be a destination.  Its remote location at the Boulders resort means most diners are retired tourists, but Phoenicians would be wise to make the trek.  With its impeccable service, stunning surroundings and creative menu, Latilla deserves a spot on the \"must-try\" list for anyone in the area.    Each plate is a work of art for the eyes as well as the palate.  A modern Mediterranean menu is diverse enough to keep picky foodies happy while still satisfying less-adventurous diners.  A thorough wine list with plenty of reasonably priced Arizona options sets Latilla apart from other resort restaurants.    There are lots of surprises here; including a truly interesting bread basket featuring terrific flat bread, a sumptuous duck appetizer and a to-die-for hazelnut chocolate cake laced with lavender.    Footnote: The restrooms are impeccably clean and smell AMAZING.  I can't remember the last time a visit to a resort washroom was this memorable!"}
{"text":"We had dinner at Latilla last night and it was fabulous. This is definitely the best food we've had while in Scottsdale/Phoenix. The service was impeccable and the food was delicious -- words I rarely dish out for a restaurant.  For those unfamiliar with the restaurant, note that it's an older crowd. We're in our late 30s whereas most people there were 60+. This isn't reflective of their food, it's reflective of their location (I should also point out that we noticed these were some of the hippest and trendiest looking 60+ year olds we've ever seen, no joke -- lol). The restaurant itself has an adobe decor and is reasonably intimate. I'd call it dressy casual (don't wear shorts here but you can feel ok wearing nice jeans and a collared shirt if you're a gentleman).  We had a truffled, duck confit risotto with a perfectly cooked 62 degree egg on top to start. OMG. Hats off to the chef. To follow, my husband had a chicken dish and I had a scallop and sun dried tomato parpadelle pasta dish. We equally loved ours and both remarked how surprised we were of the level of quality of food. We just weren't expecting it (not the restaurant's fault, we just haven't found the food outside of Mexican in Phoenix to be that amazing).  Our server, Greg, was wonderful. Latilla would be smart to make sure to hold on to him... he's a hidden gem in the fine dining world who could easily make his mark in a high end NYC restaurant.  Anyhow, moral to the story -- if you find yourself in the Phoenix area, I'd call this restaurant a must. I only don't give it 5 stars because I've traveled around the world and eaten at so many really amazing restaurants. This sincerely stacks up as a 4 star against them all, which I think is a huge compliment to the Latilla. If I was rating just for the Phoenix area, it would be a 5 star hands down. So go eat there. It's yummy. :)"}
{"text":"Excellent creative food pretty much sums it up.  The food and wine were excellent and food was wonderfully prepared with a perfect balance of herbs & spices.  Flavors were great and staff exceptionally attentive.  This is a must on the to-do eating spots in the valley."}
