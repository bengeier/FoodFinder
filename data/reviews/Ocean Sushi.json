{"text":"Decent, reasonably priced sushi. Pretty presentation, fresh. The place is clean and the service is good. They need to seriously work on their miso soup, however."}
{"text":"Such good sushiii!!! The owners are really nice people that will make some of the best sushi in Montreal. Great if you want a quick healthy and good meal!  Enjoy :)"}
{"text":"really good, fresh, affordable sushi in a quiet, clean environment. We lived down the street from this place for a couple years and never went in... and now its our sushi place and we go twice a week. They have good ready-made takeout boxes if you're looking for something quick."}
{"text":"Delivery from here is always a pleasant experience. They put something small (like cucumber maki) as a bonus for ordering (might be a $$ threshold for this reward :-)). Quality here is acceptable for a sushi addict like me. Ordering online is simple, and if an issue ever comes up, staff is nice and quick. Definitely would recommend for a foolproof sushi delivery experience."}
{"text":"Ordered from JustEat.ca as usual, trying out all the sushi places in my area.   I SPENT $50 on this meal, thinking that if I splurged a bit I'd come out with a better than usual sushi meal in Montreal.  I did not.   The teriyaki chicken was literally 1/3 of a chicken breast, breaded in panko, deep fried, and drizzled with some teriyaki sauce. With a tiny cup of rice and some saut√©ed cabbage.  I can't even consider how this could ever be worth $12.  Mind Blown. I regret not taking a photo.  The sushi was OK, filling enough and did it's job. Although the yam roll, while purple (cool!), was undercooked. Nothing like hard potato in the center of mushy rice, right?  911 roll is very tiny as are the fried wontons. 1/2 tbsp of filling in each. Itty bitty things I tell ya.  Avocado roll was great though! Surprising for Montreal sushi. Good chunk in there.   All in all, mediocre. Will probably not order again."}
{"text":"Totally fine! Friendly, clean, prompt, rolls made fresh, affordable. Simple similar options to other small sushi shops and chains, but independently owned and generally nicer. Lunch hour it was cool and quiet in here and I was happy with what I ate. I wasn't blown away, but I was totally satisfied and wouldn't hesitate to grab a bite here again."}
{"text":"Hello sushi lovers; Well, I miss you all ...... psssssssssssssst I have stumbled on a great place by luck so great , well let you decide!   I was have sushi carving on Saturday midday, well no one was open, while we going to check a pace we stumbled at one sushi on Pine Ave. and Clark ...being so hungery and adventurous we parked easily.  Looked inside the lion cave was neat, ok looks good we enter . Nice place, probably family run. The waiter handed the menu very politely and very friendly. We order the usual 2 salmon Meguro, 1 order avocado role and vegetarian soup for me. Same, for my friend except,  he ordered smoke salmon. We put an emphasis on the soup to come fast since we were in state of starvation.  4 minutes later the soup came hot, clear with nice smile, we relaxed at this point cautiously examined the soup. It was great , not like what we ever expected real Japanese at this point we got excited not to mention relieved. After, we had the soup , timely 5 minutes, Each had his plate , the look and the presentation were fantastic .  Time to see will meet the exceptions, I prepared the sauce with the wasabi and dipped the salmon in and ate it. at this point I  wanted to sing the Opera, so good the rice not too warm the salmon the right thinness beautiful.   Still, i was in doubt about the Avocado roll, well we do you expect. Same very where except this one was bigger roll. Fine, took one dipped it in the sauce and ate this time i was really amazed. It should be a crime not to have the Avocado at that place seriously, above exception.  The waiter came politely chatted with us as first time customer. The bill was ok , but there is no credit card they do not take including Discover. If there is something higher than five i would have given it to them, quit place, child friendly above excellent tremendous food. I let check that your self, on Saturday not to many sushi places open but this one is .... Please let me know was it a dream or i was awake ........"}
{"text":"Trust-- this place has the best sushi rolls in Montreal.     The \"decor\" is very unassuming, just a few simple tables and chairs with some dollar-store decorations, but don't let that discourage you! The real star of this place is the food. They've got a huge selection with lots of variety and everything we've tried was really fresh and well made. I hate it when you bite into a futomaki and, because the seaweed is going stale, all the goods come toppling out all over the place. That doesn't happen here. They're also really generous with the caviar and sesame seeds, as well as the pickled ginger garnish. The spider roll (softshell crab, caviar, crabstick, cucumber, lettuce) is to die for, so are the dragon eye (salmon, white tuna, shallot, carrot, all lightly deep-fried, caviar, lettuce, sesame-- and is also beautiful, by the way) and tentation (tuna, tempura, shallot, shrimp, and caviar wrapped in a paper-thin slice of avocado). We also really like the rolls wrapped in yellow soya paper for something different. But they've also got the standards: spicy tuna, spicy salmon, 911, philadelphia, rainbow, unagi, etc., etc. All the rolls run around $7. The only roll I've tried that I didn't like was the spicy crab. I also can't comment on the nigiri and sashimi as I've haven't tried any of either.     Never go to those horrible chains. They're so. so. bad. Go here. It's worth it."}
{"text":"dear fellow sushi lovers, I'm here to tell you how awesome this place was. The restaurant ambience was very nice and they even had some nice music playing. Ordering was a bit weird because we had to use a pencil and paper, but it was actually very efficient! This way, nobody could mess up our order, it was great. Anyways, this sushi was very good and I even ordered seconds after ordering two rolls! The veggie roll was amazing and the service was great! Soy sauce was a little sweet but I believe that that's easy to improve on. All in all, loved this place! You should definitely go!"}
{"text":"It doesn't look like much from the outside, and you may want to get it to go, but the sushi is excellent.  This is very welcome, because there's basically nowhere else in the area even worth trying for sushi."}
