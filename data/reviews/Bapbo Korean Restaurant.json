{"text":"I ordered the chicken wing from this place, and it was still bloody on the inside. The manager insisted that it is normal. I just want it to be cooked a bit more or even just microwaved, but that option never came up. Thanks for ruining the night."}
{"text":"Service is absolutely horrendous. Waitress literally threw our utensils and plates with marked scorn on the table after we mentioned we wanted to switch tables because of all the bugs close to the plant they had near the front."}
{"text":"I can't really say this is a fair review because I'm only reviewing their dukkbokki, but when I used to come here last year their dukkbokki was amazing. They totally changed it now and it doesn't taste anything like it used to. Not to mention that it had more items in it like fishballs, etc. And they bumped up the price too  other than that, they have good sushi, the waitresses are very nice and their service is relatively good. Might take awhile for your food to come if you're coming during lunch so be prepared for the wait."}
{"text":"Good food, great service, straightforward but nice decor. The bulgogi beef japchae had the right amount of beef for me and the dokbokki (under the special dishes menu) was a monster with tons of fishcakes. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch on Saturday. Very quiet. Cute and clean interior. Pleasant service. Ordered the spicy chicken stone pot bibimpap. Included kimchi side, miso soup, salad. The sides are ok, nothing special. Miso soup was nice. The bibimpap came out sizzling hot, great! Crusty rice yum. But a bit too much oil on the bottom of the bowl. The flavours themselves were just ok. Sauce was ok, I think you can buy better ones in the supermarket. Chicken was a bit dry and didn't have much marinade, the vegetables themselves were just ok- some of the veggies were pickled which is the first time I have encountered in a bibimpap. $15 for lunch including tax and tips. Overall not very memorable, probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Just having a meal here. There was a piece of rubber band in my bibbab.  Called the waitress, she picked up the rubber band and left. Came back after 5 mins to take my food away. This place absolutely does not meet health standards"}
{"text":"Glad that I tried this place after a Korean friend of mine recommended it to me. As other reviewers have noted - it's not the BEST Korean food you will ever have nor is it the best in the GTA. However, I would gladly choose this as my go-to from now on in downtown Toronto for a quick, tasty meal at a reasonable price and convenient location. The last part is key as I find that there are very few restaurants in the Bloor Koreatown that are truly noteworthy so I'm happy to have found another spot in downtown (vs. trekking up to North York) to satisfy a craving.  We tried the kimchi jigae and the kimchi gamjatang; both were tasty! The kimchi jigae could use a bit more pieces of pork but I think this also helped to keep the flavour of the broth lighter/ cleaner. The banchan were good and I appreciated that the servers were all very polite and quick to refill banchan when we asked.  There was a short line-up during dinner when we went on the holiday Monday but it seemed to be moving fairly quickly."}
{"text":"I went in here because it was closest Korean restaurant near Dundas & Yonge. First time visiting. The atmosphere was nice. Pretty great decoration & nice setting. Server were pleasant.  But I was disappointed by the food. Half of the side dishes were pretty dried looking, like the bean sprouts and zucchinis.. the picked radish was delicious though!   I ordered hot stone bibimbab with bulgogi & hot sauce ingredients in the bibimbab were basically the side dish plates mixed.. the bulgogi seemed little over cooked too.. I also thought the rice was not cooked well either. It tasted sort of soggy. I definitely had better hot stone bibimbab in other restaurants for cheaper! I think the food in general were over-priced. I'm sure it's probably because of its location though.."}
{"text":"We ordered a few things and they just tasted wrong (I cook Korean food and grew up eating Korean food)... wrong as in boil eggs shouldn't taste like orange   Seafood pancake, it looks like they didn't put eggs in it.... also there was very little seafood!  Japchae (glass noodle salad) didn't have bean sprouts in it, Japchae had always been made with bean sprouts.... it's like making pizza without cheese!! Can you imagine pizza without cheese ever?!   If i didn't know better, it seems like they are trying to be cheap and skipping on expensive ingredients...!  Also, the portion looked significantly smaller compare to the ones shown on the menu! So that's like the Woody Allen's quote \"life is like a bad restaurant, the food tastes bad, and the portion is small!\" Lol you'd get this if you're a Woody Allen fan ;)  But wait, this gets better!!... we asked the server if the cook forgot to put eggs in the seafood pancake, guess what the server said?! She said usually there is no eggs in seafood pancake!! She is Korean, so she would know seafood pancake is always made with eggs!!   I showed her a picture of the seafood pancake in the menu, and it looks yellow, which shows there is eggs in it. Guess what she said?! She said the seafood pancake picture in the menu was a little burnt and that's why it looks yellow!!  I don't know which planet she was referring to, but on earth when food is burnt, it turns black, not yellow!! (Lol it's like \"oh hey your skin turned blue, how come?!\", \"oh I was in the sun and the sun probably turned me blue\"!! Homo sapiens generally turn red when they get burnt...!)  I do have one regret... I should have followed up with this question \"So when you guys put together the menu, you prefer to put pictures of burnt food on it?! )  With that being said, i have to give it to this server lady, that she defended her employer with a straight face and lied straight through her teeth..."}
{"text":"i am no way an expert on korean food, but the dishes were very well prepared. tried the fried tofu, simple flavour but very good. and had the beef bowl, also very good, it was the daily special.  a little bit of a wait, so maybe not the best place if you are in a rush. and the seats are a little intimate so it can get a little loud and you can pretty much hear what every one is saying. but over all, good spot."}
{"text":"surprised at the rating: i came here yesterday and had a great experience.  the restaurant is clean, brightly lit, and nicely decorated: i think it gives off a homely feel without being outdated. the menu includes most of the standard korean dishes you'd find: jiggae, bibimbap, etc. note that the lunch specials are for weekdays only: it doesn't say that on the menu, but when my friend tried to order it (on a saturday) the waitress regretfully informed us of that. not a huge deal, but it would be nice if that was made clear on the menu.   after we gave our orders to the waitress, she brought over the banchan: six different types in small bowls. the portions were small, but you can ask for (free) refills. i'm actually glad the portions were small because that means less food waste: we finished the portions given to us, and then ordered refills of the ones we especially liked.   i ordered the kalbi bibimbap, which in my opinion was generously portioned for the price: i've been to other places and ordered kalbi for around the same price, only to get maybe three pieces of meat and a lot of rice. the bibimbap had a good amount of meat, lots of veggies, and the purple rice was fluffy and delicious. you can choose between sweet soy or spicy sauce for your bibimbap, which i thought was a nice touch: i think the spicy sauce is more traditional and the standard at most korean restaurants, but i'm not a fan of spicy food so i usually don't get any sauce at all. the sweet soya sauce was a great balance of savoury and sweet. i haven't tried anything else yet: most of the other customers around us also got bibimbap, so that seems to be one of their popular items.   we found the service to be good: maybe not as attentive as in some other places, but polite and friendly. we were seated quickly, and our food came out quickly considering how fresh it tasted. i actually prefer they don't constantly come over and ask how we're doing: when i raised my hand to ask for more water or banchan, the waitress came over as soon as she saw me, and came back within minutes with whatever i asked for. so yes, if you want refills on water or banchan, you have to ask for them. not sure why that's a complaint in some reviews.   overall i think it's a good korean restaurant in an area of mostly japanese restaurants. we saw lots of korean people come in, so you know it's authentic. i just wish the lunch special extended to weekends (i'm rarely in the area at mid-day on weekdays :( ). i paid about ~20$ including tax and tip, which i think was a fair price for the portion and freshness, not to mention free refills on the banchan. i plan to come back with other friends!"}
{"text":"The food at Bapbo was SO HORRIBLE that I joined  Yelp just to write this review and to save others from going to this place. I ordered the beef bulgolgi lunch special (\"bbq seasoned beef\" that tasted like boiled bland meat. The gyoza was cold with a sandy consistency. My sister ordered the spicy chicken lunch special which was absolutely tasteless (not spicy at all!) and had the texture chalk-covered strings. The lunch special came with 2 pieces of maki which was hard rice with a pollock (fake crab) centre. Not even cucumber or avocado or salmon. Just one piece of pollock. For the  ten bucks I spent, I would have preferred to buy 3 hotdogs from a hotdog stand."}
{"text":"Thought this was a pure korean restaurant but turns out it is a korean-japanese restaurant!  Still the bibimbap is quite good and the sushi was surprisingly fresh as well.  Hopefully they can keep up the quality as the 2 times I went, it was not busy there at all.  Not a bad alternative if you get sick of waiting in line for Sansotei or even Kenzo"}
{"text":"I ate a lot here when I lived around the area, but since I moved from there, I no longer have the opportunity to visit this awesome place.  The food is fresh, and delicious! The service is prompt and very friendly. And the tempura and jiggae is to die for!  I love the interiors as well, its really well light and spacious"}
{"text":"It's good. Food was delicious. It's lit yo. It's real yo. I had the fried chicken and it was not worth the price. However, the jap chie was scrumptious. Illest service around. Close to ry high!!! Baby represent!!! Last time I went, there was a screaming homeless lady. She scared me and my partner, who by the way is down to fuck. @vngxla Everything else was aight..."}
{"text":"I'm Korean and I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. The restaurant looked clean and the server was nice but the taste of the korean food was not good at all. We had three main dishes and an appetizer, and none of them were tasty. I couldn't actually finish my meal.....  Perhaps the Japanese food selection is better (I did not try any)."}
{"text":"The food is not all that great for the price they charge. The chef keeps changing and hence I've had 4 different versions of teriyaki chicken at the same location. Their is no consistency.   Do not go here in the winter as they dont have proper heating."}
{"text":"The Rabboki (rice cakes + ramen) is extremely overpriced. Approx 16 dollars for it, whereas if I was to make it myself, it would cost less than 5 for the same portion. The rice cakes were also undercooked.  Overall, would not return"}
{"text":"I went there with my friend few months ago. Not many people were there at that time. We had nice greeting and the waiter was very nice. We ordered Chicken wings and Tofu soup. The chicken wings sauce were really nice, but it was uncooked. We clearly saw the pink meat (little bit of blood as well) We asked the waiter about it and he said he will ask his manager. His manager said \"oh it is fine\". The waiter came back to us and said his manager said it is fine. We didn't want to make any more complaint because it was just appetizer and it is not the fancy place. But, we didn't dare to eat it anymore.   But then, more funny thing was the manager called the waiter and explained to him why it is cooked. He was so loud, so I can hear him.  We brought the wings back to home and microwaved it. It was cooked finally. I won't go back there anymore even though the food is decent. Because Korea restaurant with better service and the same quality of food is right near there."}
{"text":"Good Afternoon, Thank you for taking the time to read my post.  Today was my second time to this establishment.  I returned because it was very good.  What a disappointment today.  The establishment has changed both their menu and crockery.   One of the enjoyment's of this cuisine is the hot stone bowls that provide one the luxury of having hot food and incredible crispy rice on the bottom of the bowl.  This did not deliver today.  The crockery has been changed to inferior crockery which was horrible.  I asked my server about this and I was told that they have new crockery and if I wish the proper crockery I could ask for it.  At no point was it the server's fault, she had to deliver the reason. If you have are looking for a true Korean BIBIMBAP I highly suggest traveling to Bloor Street.  See you there!"}
{"text":"It's really hard to find a place to eat with no wait around Dundas Square. Everywhere is packed with lines so we walked over to this Korean place to eat. No wait but was pretty busy. We ordered a sweet potato with cheese pancake as appetizer to share. It was like eating a pizza.  As it was freezing outside, all of us wanted a hot bowl of rice ... beef bibimbap. It was a normal bowl of bibimbap, nothing out of the ordinary. It was served with a cooked egg instead of a raw one to stir inot the rice. Really filled my stomach, I couldn't finish it but as I was a lot warmer when I went back outside."}
{"text":"Short ribs was very very tasty. It was not your regular bossam. They \"modernized\" it....with side of \"steamed\" cabbage, kimchi and pickled cabbage. My only disappointment: it didn't come with rice. It's like ordering curry without rice or naan. It is ridiculous or just damn cheap. Just doesn't make sense. I would rather they charged a few dollar more than cheap out.   Service was ok."}
{"text":"Came here with a coworker for lunch. There were quite a few Korean customers so we took that as a good sign. The side dishes were average and not memorable. I ordered the kimchi stew. It had a lot of kimchi, a few pieces of pork and a few slices of firm tofu. It's comparable to the other Korean places I've been to in koreantown. My coworker got the teriyaki salmon lunch combo and it came with I guess 3 oz or so of salmon on a bed of vegetables. It looked quite good. I won't hesitate to come here again to satisfy my Korean food cravings."}
{"text":"Udon and hot stone are good!! Portion is hugh (soup+salad+sides+large main dish) I have been there three times. Waitress is courteous as well. Will come back and try other food for sure!"}
{"text":"bapbo oh bapbo  their oven-baked sushi is sooo scrumptious!  try the disco shrimp. goodness.  they used to have probably the best ddukbokki i've ever tasted since it's pan fried.. crispy on the outside yet soft and chewy on the inside with perfectly sticky red spicy sauce.. but the last time i went there, it doesn't taste like it's pan-fried anymore. i hope they would go back to the pan-fried version.  the spicy salmon roll is huge but doesn't taste that special  i like the simple and woody decor of the place and how it's not overly crowded."}
{"text":"service is horrible would not recommend,  food is very salty, rice is uncooked, plenty of similar restaurants in the area, would not walk back into this one."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Don't go!   The chopsticks splinter and can stab into your fingers which is a sign of their cheapness.   When we went to pay, they charged me and my girlfriend for drinks even though she didn't order a drink. They charged me more for a drink than they should have. Then they wanted us to stay back because they messed up the order and had charged me for the wrong meal. It was a complete headache, all the time the staff was extremely unprofessional and again accused my girlfriend of getting a drink when she only had water. They were shouting in public trying to embarrass us by telling me how much I left for tip. Yeah, no shit I leave bad tip for bad service. They should have just let us go instead of shouting that I'd underpaid them by $1.  Never coming back."}
{"text":"The pork bone soup was super delicious. The broth was just perfect,  not too spicy not salty. The meat was very tender and falls off the bone easily. Side dishes were okay. I would definitely come back again for the pork bone soup and lunch special on weekdays"}
{"text":"My friend and I were craving something hot, soupy and Korean after walking around eatons and we stumbled upon this place. The place is very spacious so patrons can dine comfortably. I ordered the gamjatang and she ordered the soon tofu. Our meal came with side dishes as well. I'll comment on what I had... the pork bone soup broth was just spicy and didn't have much flavour... the bones had very little meat and wasn't tender enough to just use a spoon to tear off the pork. The soon tofu also came without a cracked egg..It was disappointing actually.. what I liked about this place was that they served purple rice and service was also not too shabby. Servers checked up on you every now and then but for some reason they didn't really refill our teas :/"}
{"text":"I really liked the hot stone Bibimbap at this newly opened Korean restaurant.  They did not skimp on the meat or other toppings, and they had a variety of meats to choose from and even different sauces.  The stone bowl was properly burning hot, so my rice was toasty all the way through the meal (seriously, I was sweating as I ate it) and it left that nice crusty layer on the bottom at the end.  Great wintertime meal! For $10 (for lunch - not sure about dinner price) it seemed like a pretty good deal as I think it's usually a bit more expensive for bibimbap in a stone bowl.  For those who do not like the stone bowl, it's a dollar less for non-stone bowl bibimbap. Also on the menu are tofu stew or pork bone soup ($8), although I can't comment on how those taste.  The inside of the restaurant is super clean, comfy and a decent size. Tables and chairs are natural unstained wood, for a casual Korean atmosphere. Something about the way the food was plated and served make this restaurant seem less traditional, perhaps the absence of bunchan, those little side dishes they usually bring.  All we got was some kimchi with our meal.  Service was decent, attentive but not super fast (the restaurant was about 90-95% full). I'd have to say it's probably one of the better lunch choices around the area, and definitely the best bibimbap without going all the way to Korea town."}
{"text":"I ordered bibimbap and spicy rice cake. Bibimbap was overall pretty good. I didn't expect that they'd serve half of a hard boiled egg, as opposed to one pan-fried egg. The spicy rice cake did not have an egg in it, and I'd say it wasn't as great. The server was prompt and responsive, and also I liked the decor, so I am bumping up to 4-star. I might come back if I'm in the area and in need of some Korean food."}
{"text":"Bright clean restaurant. Varied menu and effective staff. I had the Kimchi stew which was perfect for lunch on this cold March day. It was excellent. Lots of green tea. Will come again."}
{"text":"- A very lovely restaurant; comfortable and clean. Good ambience. - Excellent service. I felt really welcomed here.  - The food was average. I have tried the tofu stew, the bibimbap, and the sushi, all of them were decent (but not overwhelmingly great).  - The price was labelled a little high (for the quality of the food), but I think it's acceptable. (note: I'm a poor college student so everything over $12 is pricey to me lol)    The verdict: 7/10, would recommend to families."}
{"text":"Their service was good but Korean appetizers were lacking in proportion and they were only below decent compared to more authentic places. I ordered the hot plate Bibimbap which looks and sounds cool but actually it was way to hot to eat and took a long time to cool down. Our table of four ordered three of them so it got pretty hot in there for us."}
{"text":"Convenient Korean place if you're in the area. Sushi items were fresh but mediocre in quality, cut, and quantity; seafood udon was insipid but inoffensive. They served decent banchan but service was generally inattentive."}
{"text":"Pretty good! I think my stars could go to 4 once I get the chance to try more items. This first time we got the pork soontofu stew and the spicy squid bowl. Both were spicy, prepare yourself, but as I worked my way into it the spice got more enjoyable. The stew was very good. The spicy bowl, was also good, but we were both a little surprised at how little squid there was to vegetable ratio, given the price. This spicy squid is also not QUITE as good as that from Home of Hot Taste. For the restaurant itself, it was a nice place, well kept and a cozy atmosphere. The service was also very good, friendly, attentive, everything you need. Overall, I want to go back and try more!"}
{"text":"If you're nearby and craving bibimbap, this is a safe choice. Starting at around $13, you can get a somewhat customized bibimbap - your choice of meat topping, your choice of sauce, comes in the regular and \"emperor\" variety...I was happy to see chicken as an option for my bibimbap as sometimes, I'm not feeling for beef.  Dropping in on a Thursday night, we were seated immediately and told more seating was available near the back of the restaurant. Tables were full and people came in later on, probably because they were in the vicinity. The décor and ambiance are average, nothing fancy really, but I did appreciate that it was well lit (in the front of the store at least) unlike Kimchi House across the street.  Food took a bit of time to arrive, my friends got bibimbaps while I got a soon tofu soup. The bibimbaps were sizeable and filling, and came with miso soup. The soon tofu soup was satisfying, a simple dish with nothing special to talk about. I appreciated that ordering \"no spice\" meant exactly that - my soon tofu was completely plain Jane with no spicy oil, chili pepper flakes, or the like.  A trusty place for bibimbap and great if you need some variety - I'll be back for the vicinity to Eaton Centre, and potentially trying other menu items."}
{"text":"Decent Korean food & defnly good for the immediate area. However, doesn't compare in terms of quality & value to K-town eats such as Ka Chi & Korea House."}
{"text":"Came for lunch. Ordered the Kalbi Bibimbap. Very tasty, but could use more meat and less of the typical little dishes of appetizers (just not my thing, that's all. Nothing wrong with them). Great food overall.  Quality: 8/10. Value: 6.5/10. Service: 8/10. Overall 7/10 (not an average)."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. The staff all very attentive and friendly. Weekday crowd is a mix of business people and Ryerson Students. I wifi be coming back again for the short ribs. They looked delicious."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Waitress plopped the POS system down and put my credit card on the table instead of handing it back to me"}
{"text":"This review is only on the food I ate (too hungry to pay attention to other details).  For someone who eats Korean food quite often, I've never tried bibimbap. Well, it was mainly because I didn't see it as anything spectacular. It has a variety of veggies, a bit of meat on a bed of rice and topped with an egg. All my Korean food loving friends love bibimbap so I thought \"today's the day! I'll find out what's so special about this bibimbap.\"  Okay so, it was exactly how I thought it would be--rice and veggies and meat. The presentation looks so nice because everything is so organized. It comes with sauce (soy sauce or spicy gochujang sauce) that you put on. I really like spicy so I put some on and since it was thick, I tried not to put too much. Mix up all the contents and then you eat. Turns out that you basically have to slather on so much sauce to really get any spice and I'd say its more on the sweet side! Most of the veggies were unseasoned so that didn't help the lack of flavour. The bulgogi was quite sweet sweet and not salty enough. I love savoury salty foods so I did not enjoy it that much at all... :(  In my honest opinion, even though the portion is good, I wouldn't eat bibimbap at a restaurant again. It's nothing special, you could probably make it at home and enjoy it that way. I'd much rather go for the soups (my friend got soon tofu that he said was great) than the rice dishes here if I come again."}
{"text":"Umbrella Guy @ Bapbo.  Hosted a lunch meetup here. It wasn't too busy around 12 PM but later on more customers started coming in and by 12:30 it was pretty full.  There's a lot of korean paintings and decorations along the walls, which gives it a unique feel while you're dining. Bead curtains are used to separate tables, and there's a lot of cans and bottles of alcoholic drinks on display throughout the restaurant.  The restaurant is advertised as Korean-Japanese, so looking through the menu you can see items from both cuisines. I think it's still mostly korean though given that most of the dishes are what you'd find in a korean restaurant.  Menu comes with a number of share-ables such as korean pancakes or korean fried chicken. There's a page full of lunch specials as well, but I don't think it's much different from the regular menu. I did get miso soup, so maybe that's the \"special\" part.  In terms of side-dishes, a lot of pictures are showing 8 different items. We got 6, but maybe lunch time has less side-dishes? I don't know.  I ordered the dak galbi bibimbap lunch special. It was served pretty quickly, maybe 3-5 minute wait. Two bottles of sauces were provided, which seems different from other reviews.  Portion size was pretty good, but not a lot of chicken. I enjoyed the flavours, and the rice stuck at the bottom of the stone bowl was really crispy as well.  Tea is free, but it was diluted and we weren't offered refills for tea or water. So if you want stuff you'll have to take initiative!"}
{"text":"Location: 142 Dundas Street W (Toronto, ON M5G 1C3) Service: Decent Price: $$  It was okay... I wasn't a big fan of the food but it wasn't terrible. I remember that my miso soup- actually most of the food that I ordered were salty. Therefore, I didn't enjoy the food too much. BUT, one of my favourite Korean food was on the menu (tteokbokki) and it was delicious. The cool thing about it was that they had snack size and a larger portion for tteokbokki and I found that the snack size was more than enough- it was plentiful. To be honest, it wouldn't be my first choice to go back here but I wouldn't mind. Maybe next time I shall try their pork bone soup...  Verdict: ehhh"}
{"text":"We had dinner here on a whim and it was a nice evening.  Snagged a table for 3 on a Friday evening after only a few minutes of waiting.  We had the kalbi beef appetizer, hot stone chicken bibimbap, seafood udon and bulbogi beef stew.  Food was a bit delayed as a computer glitch resulted in most of our order not going through...but we just killed time by requesting a second round of complimentary six Korean mini appetizers.  Very warm and cozy ambiance.  Glad our random drop-in filled our tummies with rich and aromatic goodness."}
{"text":"No idea why it's only 3 star. A perfect place when ur in hurry. Great service great food"}
{"text":"Coming from Socal and having lots of Korean food there, my expectations are pretty high. The service is fairly fast and the quality of food is OK, if you haven't had Korean food before or if you need your Korea food fix this place will do fine.   Like most Korean places, they serve a small selection of banchan; all of which are just OK. I ordered the spicy rice cakes, which were more fried than the soft and chewy style that I'm used to seeing in LA. I got the beef bibimbap with spicy sauce as my main. It wasn't bad (but nothing special) and they give you a lot of food.    From my experience with Korean food, I prefer a spicier selection of food. I thought the kimchi, rice cakes and bibimbap sauce were all mild."}
{"text":"There are better and more authentic Korean places for sure, but if you're in the area and are craving some Korean food, this place is not bad.   I consistently get their tempura bibimbap, which I really enjoy. They give you a significant portion of sauce to pour over the bibimbap and mix in, which I think really makes or breaks the dish sometimes.   The place is decently big so you can get a seat pretty quick. The service is pretty quick so you can be in and out pretty fast, but don't expect top quality service.   I think the food is pretty good for what you pay, and it's convenience gives it brownie points."}
{"text":"Ordered the appetizer-sized Korean fried chicken along with a Gam Ja Tang with less spice. Both were delicious.  The boneless chicken chunks were rather small but still yummy nonetheless. It reminded me more of karaage than what the menu picture suggested as thighs and drumsticks. The batter was crunchy and well seasoned but could have been more crisp, and the chicken was tender and juicy but a little more fatty than my health-conscious-self would prefer.  As a non-spicy eater, the flavor of the Gam Ja Tang was really great. It was just the right amount of spice and the meat was tender enough to easily fall off the bone. I also very much so enjoyed the variety of complimentary side dishes.   The overall service and atmosphere of the restaurant was also great - cozy with wooden furniture, well-lit, sizable TV, and friendly and attentive staff."}
{"text":"I stopped here for a quick work lunch and was pleasantly greeted then seated.  I ordered the Bulgolgi Bibimbap which comes with three choices of sauces.  Either the Soy, Gochujang (spicy Korean hot pepper paste) or Miso.  Obviously, I had to go traditional and had the spicy chili paste.  The bulgogi was slightly thicker cut and had the familiar sweet marinade.  So every spoonful was a meaty bite. I love how they use purple rice instead of white rice, but it's probably just a few sprinkling of black rice that change the colour.    Each meal comes with 7 side dishes, a miso soup and a small creamy cabbage salad (tasted almost like a coleslaw, but less tart).  Bapbo gets bonus points because the side dishes are refillable.  I ended up getting 3 Kimchi refills. One was finished off before the main dish arrived, the second was mixed into the bibimbap and the third was there as an after meal snack.  Just to continue the spicy sensation in my mouth.    Bapbo has a daily bibimbap special for $9.95, also if you place a take-out order it is slightly discounted. However, if you opt to dine-in the prices are a little more than what you would normally pay which I believe should be around the $8-$9 mark.  Perhaps, it's attributed to the high rent in the area.  I walked out of the restaurant leaving a total of $17 including taxes and tip."}
{"text":"This is our go to Korean spot in TO  The blogogi is delish, the bimbop is spot on and the service is great!   It's a no msg spot which is a must in my book.   Try it you might like it too!"}
{"text":"Bapbo! This restaurant I have walked by many many times. My sister and I arrived here around 12-12:10 and the restaurant was already quite full of some people. The aesthetics here are on point, the washroom is clean (watch your step), and the interior and exterior is clean and instagram-worthy. I was planning on ordering one of the stews/soups but upon looking at a neighbouring table, the portions were a bit small so I ordered avocado bibimbap. The bibimbap came with an egg, avocado, lettuce, carrots, zucchini, radish, and beansprouts. The rice was filled with beans as well and the meal came with a choice of gochujang or soya sauce. I picked the spicy sauce. The food was bland compared to other restaurants' bibimbap and I found myself constantly putting some of the spicy sauce. However, since it was $9.95 before tax for the avocado bibimbap, I couldn't really complain because it was cheaper. But it unfortunately did not fill me.  The side dishes were all delicious. We had 6 dishes: potato, bean sprouts, seaweed, macaroni, kimchi, and radish.  The service was also great; fast, kind, and nice.  But in terms of the food, if I do return, I'd try another dish and not the bibimbap. But the store is clean and the servers are all kind."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch yesterday and the food was decent. The portion was good as well and had to pack half of my pork bone soup to go. But then this morning, I was puking while having diarrhea...that is the only thing I ate the whole day that is different than my friends and family and they are all fine. So I probably would not come back here for a while..."}
{"text":"I love how they have shared meals for two! This is the place in Dundas W that has korean noodle hot pot soup.  It's a little pricey than other korean restaurants that I've been to. And i have tried plenty. $29 something plus tax so around $20 something tax and tip if you split it. And oh, the place is nice."}
{"text":"almost the most delicious sweet potato tempura i ever had!  Make sure you ask about stone pot when you get the bibimbap"}
{"text":"I've gotten food poisoning twice from this place, once from sushi and another time from pork bone soup.  After the first time, I thought it was just because of one bad piece of sushi. Now it seems this restaurant doesn't have good food safety practices. I wouldn't go here."}
{"text":"I've been here twice with coworkers and I enjoyed my stay here.   Due to note that if you are coming in for lunch, arrive before 12pm as the place gets really busy. If your order is in before 12pm, you'll get your food by 1230ish.  Every time I go there, I get Chicken Yaki Udon. I'm a noodle guy so I enjoyed this meal.   The overall experience is good. The place is clean and neat. It's a bit on the pricey side, but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"The ramen had instant noodles instead of real noodles. Would not recommend because they use cheap ingredients"}
{"text":"This has been my go-to Korean restaurant in the area for years.  The food is typical Korean fare but solidly executed ... I like their bibimbaps, seafood pancake, bento boxes, etc.  Good variety of banchan and they are happy to refill them.  Reasonable prices.  The service is hit or miss -- I've learned from experience to avoid busy times like Saturday night, when the waitstaff get totally overwhelmed and everything is slow.  But most of the time I've had no issues with the service.  Check it out if you're in the area and craving Korean (I much prefer Bapbo to their competition across the street.)"}
{"text":"My friends and I went to Bapbo for lunch- they take reservation for lunch time which is a plus. The restaurant is very clean and service was excellent. Complement corn tea is delicious. I had soon-tofu with seafood and my friends had Korean spicy chicken lunch special with tempura and budae-chi-gae (stew with ham, kimchi and tofu). Everyone enjoyed their food. My soon-tofu was cooked perfectly with fresh seafood. The bento box was enormous.  Compared to other Korean restaurants nearby side dishes here are nothing special- just 3 types of kimchi (radish and 2 different kinds of cabbage kimchi).  We were all content after lunch, would def. come back."}
{"text":"Really cute and relaxing decor. Service is good too (although there's a tiny bit of a language barrier). Food is standard but reasonably priced. Tried two items from the lunch menu (bulgogi and bibimbap hot pot) and two orders of the pork bone soup. One of the soups was piping hot while the other one was just warm. The portions were very filling."}
{"text":"Had the porkbone soup tonight. Came with 3 pieces of pork bone and a bowl of purple rice. Rice was really good and had nice texture. The soup was flavourful and a bit spicy. The pork bones were also delicious but one piece was a bit cold.  The side dishes were mediocre...nothing too special. Service was really fast and the place is nice and cozy.  Prices are higher than other places, maybe due to location. (12.99 for pork bone soup).  My company for the night had tofu soup which was yummy and spicy."}
{"text":"This place looked so good on the outside. It was busy and the menu seemed to have a bit of everything.   We opted for one of those hot pot stews. The spicy chicken one.   Before that came out, the side dishes arrived. There were 6, but the portions were quite small and no refills were offered throughout our meal.   The chicken stew itself was quite spicy and served with two bowls of rice. The stew itself was mostly instant ramen and tofu, which I wasn't a huge fan of. It got really thick within 5 minutes of being on the burner and we turned it off.   The food itself was just okay. But what was awful was the service. We waited a while to get our order taken and our waters were never refilled. Twice a server walked by us with a jug of water and didn't look to see that our glasses were empty. When we asked for the bill, it took a while to get it. Just didn't seem that friendly. What made me laugh was the debit machine's tipping options were 15%, 20%, and 25%. Haha. No thank you. And this is coming from a fellow waitress that typically tips 20%."}
{"text":"I went with my Korean friends. They said it's pretty authentic. I tried many pork bones soups before but this one is so far one of my favourite. I love the way that they have spice in it but not so spicy! I can seriously enjoy the taste of the soup.   I will definitely come back. And highly recommend the pork bone soup!"}
{"text":"Koreans normally order just a kimchee soup and rich that comes with. But it was like 'are you not ordering more?' I hated the servings."}
{"text":"Ok, I know that giving 1/5 stars is pretty harsh, but the food and to some extent the service were so underwhelming tonight that I really can't rate Bapbo any higher than this.   Pros- Pretty good value for the quantity, especially compared to neighboring Korean restaurants downtown. Prices are pretty similar to Koreatown Korean restaurants and slightly cheaper than one of its nearest competitors, Kimchi Korea House. $11 ish including tax on stews that come with rice, but the bibimbaps are a bit more pricey at $16 ish versus $10 at Kimchi Korea House. But note, the bibimbaps are huge here while the stews are pretty small.  Clean and traditional style venue.  Cons- Banchans (complimentary side dishes): Really tiny portions and despite having 4 people in my group they only gave us 6 dishes (usually only enough for 1-2 people).   Food: I ordered the spicy soon tofu stew with seafood and it was super underwhelming tonight. It was probably 75% fluid vs 25% content with the tofu being all mashed up and literally 1 clam at the bottom and a few tiny shrimp and loose pieces of squid. Disappointing. My friend's ramen was also very basic with little toppings and the noodles resembling Mr. Noodles rather than real Japanese-style egg-y ramen. I definitely like the food at Kimchi Korea House more for the quality.  Service: Friendly, but slow and not very observant. Our waters were never refilled during the 2 hours that we were there and with all that MSG and sodium in our food... So thirsty. Our empty banchan trays were also ignored until I raised my hand for refills.  Probably won't be back again when there are so many other Korean restaurants downtown to choose from."}
{"text":"one of the best korean plc in town. clean. nice service. there is one pretty waitress. shes hot. i came to see her again bit shes not here...... but food is what actually got me to come back. wud recommended 1000 times.  good kalbi. ok kimchi pancake."}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time and they have changed their menu and possible different chef. The seafood pancake was really greasy n lack of seafood . We ordered the emperors hot stone rice with beef  and  the portion is big enough to feed 2 ppl. They give u a choice of sweet soy or chili sauce on the side.  We would recommend the fried chicken. It was so tender n juicy inside n chrispy outside. And it was do good with the special mayo that comes with it. In general this busy restaurant quality had went down plus the different menu and the taste of food different than before. In terms of services it was slow. We have asked for water the moment we sat down. When the food arrives, the water still haven't been serve and we have to ask for it. They don't fill up our water glass even when they sees it. We have to ask for it. We ask for our bill and we waited for awhile and still didn't come. Basically you'll have to ask twice for everything before it comes."}
{"text":"Food was decent for a Korea restaurant for a also decent price. The service was okay too."}
{"text":"realllly great avocado rolls! I went there one time and the server was attentive and quick. When I went back a second time there were multiple servers who were slow and inattentive. So I'm torn on this, but the food is really good so it is deserving of 4 stars."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times and it's alright. Their servers are quite friendly and nice so that's a plus. Their interior and decor is not too shabby BUT their seats man. I really don't understand why they used a bench-like seating design?!? Like I'm constantly scared my things are gonna fall off because there's a hole at the back. No bueno amigos. Also, it ain't comfortable either.   Food wise, they do have a variety of things to choose from (although I do wish they have more soup or stew options) BUT they are a bit more pricey than other Korean restaurants. Why? I don't know. If it tasted amazing I would understand why, but their food is just okay. Nothing in particular that brings out the food maniac in me. So yeah.   p.s. one of their banchans is pretty adorable to eat (the soy sauced soy bean? ITS SOME KINDA BEAN OKAY AND IT TASTES PRETTY DAMN GOOD. GOOD TO EAT WITH ZEE RICE)"}
{"text":"An alright Korean restaurant Liked the atmosphere and decor. The food was pretty good, and the service was alright. Food wasn't the most authentic, and didn't have the largest portions either. But worth a try if you're looking for Korean food."}
{"text":"Was alright. Korean food was OK, but nothing really blew me out of the water and it was still quite pricey considering the amount. I would not really go out of my way to eat here, only if I'm hungry and it's convenient. Service was quite slow and it's pretty cramped in some areas.  Service: 3/5 Food: 3/5 Price: 2/5  Overall: 2.75/5"}
{"text":"I am sorry to see that some diners have not had as positive an experience at Bapbo as me. I had the bibimbap and it was quite delicious. Very big and the spicy sauce, should you choose to get it, can be intense. Things seemed clean and fresh and I especially like when there is burnt rice on the bottom of the bowl, nice and crispy!"}
{"text":"Was seated quickly, ordered the tteobokki and kimchi soon tofu. The rice cakes were nice and crisp,just as yummy as I remember. One thing I forgot to mention last time was that the rice cakes are bite sized pieces c: The soon tofu was fine, but I was disappointing when it didnt come with egg."}
{"text":"This place was A-OK.. The food was good.  I was disappointed that they used a hardboiled egg on my bi bim bop.  The best part of having an egg over rice is having the yolk spill over it. I found this place a bit pricy considering similar restaurants with better tasting plates. The service was very friendly and the decor was well done and clean.  Aesthetically this place was outstanding.  Taste and Price was fair."}
{"text":"Cozy Korean restaurant along Dundas street.  Came in around 6:30pm and it wasn't too busy.  Got the Gamjatang and it was as expected: nothing amazing but your typical gamjatang fare.  Portions for the gamjatang were good, but the side dishes were a bit small.  It started getting busy while I was eating and noticed a few people waiting for tables.  I'd come back here if I ran out of food options along Dundas or Yonge, but this place satisfied my gamjatang craving for $10.95+tax."}
{"text":"This is one of the korean restaurants near me that I have not tried until recently. It's located on a busy strip of Dundas (close to Bay) and I figure gets enough walk in traffic to stay afloat. While not as cheap as k-town on bloor, I had hoped it could be a decent place to go to.  We ordered the tofu stew (w/ pork) and the bulgogi stew. The photo of the tofu stew had a egg in it, but the server said it actually didn't come with egg and was another $1. I thought that was pretty misleading (as this dish usually comes with an egg at other korean places).  There were 6 ban chans that arrived first. Small portions, but the quality was okay. The bulgogi stew was not bad, pretty sweet. The tofu stew came with a mild spice but as I was eating, I bit into something hard and realized it was part of the egg shell. That was a pretty big turn off especially as I paid extra for it!  In conclusion, expensive compared to other korean restaurants and the service/quality did not give me confidence to try it again."}
{"text":"Really average Korean fare. Came on a Saturday night and ordered their special: Pork Bone Soup for 7.95. The restaurant was only half-filled at 8:30.   The service was sub-par. The waitresses didn't bother asking us if we wanted water or tea, and left us to browse the menu. We had to ask for water and after taking our orders, we were not given any side dishes for another 10 minutes. There were 6 very small side dishes provided. The food took a while to arrive and was definitely not hot enough. For a soup that is supposed to arrive in a hot stone bowl, you would expect it to still be boiling when it is brought out. It was barely steaming. At least it tasted okay...  Not sure if we came on a bad day, but for something so standard, I would expect better at a Korean restaurant. Not too sure I would return unless I'm the area seriously craving Korean."}
{"text":"They keep changing their menu here. Like.. quite often. However, I can definitely tell you that the hot stone bibimbap is delicious here. I got the kimchi bacon one with the spicy sauce (the miso sauce is also good), and it was absolutely delicious.  It would really fill you up too! (And if you get it for take-out, I think they actually put it in a stone bowl and then take the rice out for you, making it nice and crispy!)  However, my friend got the cabbage wraps once, and it was quite underwhelming, so I don't recommend that."}
{"text":"Fried chicken is so tender and delicious! Pork bone soup is great! Side dishes are good too!"}
{"text":"Good korean food, everything we ordered looked exactly like the pictures from the menu. The bulgogi in particular was quite good."}
{"text":"Bapbo continues my search for the best mid-priced Korean restaurant in Toronto. We arrived with a group of 3 at this restaurant for dinner on a Friday night. We were quickly seated quickly, despite the fact that the restaurant is packed.  We ended up ordering a selection of appetizers, and a main for each. The rice cake appetizer was delicious, and can easily rival the same dish at Momofuku. The fried tofu appetizer also was clean in flavours, although it lacked complexity.  Our mains consisted of bibimbap and squid stir fry. The bibimbap was seasoned conservatively, while the squid stir fry was aggressively seasoned. Neither stood out as anything special, but did taste ok. However, for the price of the meal, I would think that more flavour could've been imparted into the food. Side dishes were also provided, albeit small portions than usual. In terms of service, the waitresses were extremely courteous and helpful, they were easily able to help us with extra utensils and water refill even among such a busy service.  In the end, Bapbo satisfies as a ordinary Korean restaurant with great service, beautiful interior, and delicious appetizers. Unfortunately, it does not stand out from the crowd."}
{"text":"Bapbo Korean Restaurant is located on the Dundas Street, downtown Toronto. Dundas Street is one of the busiest street downtown Toronto. There are so many restaurants on this street.  Those restaurants are all different types of cuisines, such as Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Greek, and etc. I had a lunch at Bapbo Korean restaurant on my 1st day of traveling.  Basically, Bapbo Korean Restaurant serves both Korean and Japanese food. It picks serving classic dishes at intimate wood tables in a contemporary setting. I've been there right at the lunchtime. The restaurant was very busy. Because I was only one person, I got a table very easy. After I sat down, the server brought the menu to my table and began to serve me the drinks.  The menu looks fancy with images, which helps me to order the food easier. A few minutes later, I decided what I would like to eat for lunch. I've ordered $10.95 KimchiJJigae. It's spicy kimchi stew served with pork and tofu. Also, it came with a bowl rice and couple free cold dishes.  My food came out very fast. The soup was boiling and hot. The soup was super tasty and delicious. The rice was in the purple color, which was different from other Korean restaurants I've eaten before. The small cold dishes tasted great too. I very enjoyed having a lunch at Bapbo Korean Restaurant. Cheap and Tasty! Highly Recommend to people!"}
{"text":"Pretty average Korean restaurant. Taking into consideration of all the excellent korean places in the downtown area, Bapbo doesn't land more than a 3 star on both food quality and price.  I ordered the shrimp tempura bibimbap which was $13.95, and my husband got the bulgoi beef bibimbap for $11.95, so right off the bat the prices are considerably high compared to places like Ka Chi's bibimbap for only $10-11. The taste was pretty decent, didn't have a WOW factor, but the appetizers were super duper small and lack the variety of a typical korean place. Weirdly, they also only give you a little tiny dish of gochujang for a big ol' bowl of bibmbap which for me was not a good sauce-to-rice ratio.    However, the decor is very beautiful and clean with a great ambiance and friendly service."}
{"text":"Not many Korean restaurants around Yonge/Dundas area so gave this restaurant a try but was disappointed in their food. The overall service was good, very friendly and attentive even when it got more busy during the evening. But the food is another story.   Ordered the following:  * Seafood Soon Tofu * Bulgogi with rice cakes   As usual, got ban chan (7 different side dishes- Kimchi, Bean Sprouts, Beans, Cucumbers, Potatoes, Radish, Macaroni). It tasted OK nothing out of the ordinary. The Seafood Soon Tofu is served with a bowl of rice. It was bland and watered down, the broth was just ugh disappointing. I had to ask for chili flakes to \"liven up\" the dish but it still lacked a lot. It was overpriced due to location and still wasn't as enjoyable as it could have been.   Bulgogi with rice cakes was served in a large plate, it was fresh and tasted ok but it was too sweet especially at the end. I think the cook put too much sauce or something, it was an overwhelming sweet flavour which left a not so pleasant taste in your mouth.   I have tried the Bibimbap here before and it's much better than the other dishes in comparison but if you want authentic Korean food go venture to Yonge/Finch or Christie area. It's just not worth it."}
{"text":"+.5 for service  Considering all the hype surrounding Japanese restaurants along the Dundas strip, this one is often overlooked. In fact, I myself admit to not noticing this place until my colleagues took me here for lunch on a weekday. At first I was like \"There's a 'Bapbo' nearby? I walk by here everyday and I never see it\". Turns out there is!  The decoration looks like a traditional Japanese/Korean restaurant. Nothing too spectacular, but for what it is it'll do. I considered getting the sashimi lunch, but I wasn't too fond of the price and figured this isn't the best place to get sushi/sashimi. Therefore, I decided to go with the seafood udon.  The food took a little while to come, but the lunch crowd was quite busy so I'll let that slide. I will say, for $13.95 I...kinda expected a little bit more. The udon was of the sanuki style (aka the good kind) and the toppings were overall decent, but I somewhat expected a bit of uniqueness to my food. It was probably comparable to Manpuku, but Manpuku's prices are half of this place.  Service was excellent, and I give full credit to that. I might give this place another try for the bibimbap (since it seems to be a popular item), but nothing else really attracted me from coming back."}
{"text":"First time customer :) the restaurant is so cute! The decor is very unique and has cultural characteristics. The food was good and slightly altered compared to the regular typical Korean restaurants you'd be expecting. The prices are average compared to other restaurants as well. Service was a bit slow but very friendly people. Definitely a good place for a bite with friends and family :)"}
{"text":"To be incredibly upfront, the food was quite delicious! We had the appetizer rice cakes, and they were crispy, chewy and a little sweet. All of the side dishes had a bit of a sweet taste to them, and you can refill them however much as you want. The bibimbap comes in a hot stone pot, and you can choose between three sauces. The food bumped up the rating, but otherwise I would not come back.   The service was really quite horrible. We came on a rather busy Friday night, and we were second in line- however, the staff said the wait would be around 15 minutes long, even though there was already an empty (not cleaned) table in the corner. In fact, they avoided cleaning that table for a rather long time.   When we asked for anything- water, side dishes- it would take ages before the waiters would come and listen to our request. When it was around 8 pm, the restaurant was mostly empty, and the staff downgraded to only one waiter who worked slowly in the restaurant. If you want to eat at Bapbo, it's probably better to order takeout instead."}
{"text":"I've tried beef bulgogi it was ok.  Another time coming there, I tried for the first time a hot pot stew dish with tofu and pieces of pork (soon tofu ?). It came with purple rice. The dish was an explosion of flavours. I enjoyed especially that it was smoking hot the entire time I was eating it (because it's in a hot pot). I think the quality of the food exceeds the price ($8 w/o tax). I will definitely have it again. Very much recommended."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant and I can't figure out why the star rating on this site isn't higher than it is. We are great fans of Korean food and we eat here a lot.  My wife more often than not has the pork bone soup and I like the Bibimbap bowl and have never been disappointed.  Generous servings, very tasty and reasonably quick service.  Atmosphere is typically Korean with lots of hard seating and small tables but hey that what it's about right!"}
{"text":"This is a solid option for Korean in this neighbourhood. The space is bigger than it looks from the street (there is a back area) and the decor is simple and home-y. Service is unremarkable. They could be a bit more attentive with things like re-filling water (especially with all the spicy food!!), but no major issues otherwise. I went on a Friday night and it was pretty busy -- had to wait about 10 mins. for a table.   The food is good, and I would say slightly better than Kimchi across the street. The bibimbap was great -- you can choose between the usual red spicy sauce, or sweet soy, or miso. They have a daily bibimbap special for $9.95, which is probably the best value thing you can order. I had the chicken one, and it was chicken breast, which was good (not the fatty scraps that you sometimes get). Some of the mains are a bit more expensive, in the $20-25 range. Looking around, the hot pot seems really popular and can be shared by 2. I also tried to ddukbokki appetizer, which was really tasty, and had a nice crispness and amount of spice.   I would come back if I had a craving for Korean, as the location is really central and the menu has lots of things that sounded yummy (like the bo ssam...). Note that they also have Japanese dishes like sushi, tempura, etc. but really, you should come here for Korean as there are better sushi restaurants in the area (Japango, Yutaka) if that is what you want."}
{"text":"The service is really bad never filled our water, the food has no flavor, we had to ask for the side dishes and they're extremely small portion. Rice is hard, we had to go to the counter and pay, it's so overpriced for the food and service. Bad experience do not recommend."}
{"text":"I came in here today (Saturday) because the two Japanese places I wanted to eat at were closed for lunch. I've been here before but it wasn't as great as it was today. I ordered Agedashi tofu and Bibim Nengmyun. Most people would think the agendashi tofu is average here, but the one I ate today totally hit the spot. They used silky soft tofu and fried it in a light batter. I asked for a less spicy Bibim Nengmyun because I can't eat very spicy things. But the kitchen was accompanying of my sensitive tastebuds :)   I had to get seconds on the side dishes because they were sooooo good!"}
{"text":"We had an amazing experience as first Korean meal for us, we ordered eel bibimbap and kimchi ramen, the price wasn't very cheap though, but the quality, the freshness and the service was very good. I enjoyed the kimchi ramen and find it a very exquisite experience, and it believe they need to improve the taste of the bibimbap, i felt it might be better with adding sesame oil, and the rice was not as crisp as expected."}
{"text":"I had a hot stone bibimbap twice. The first time I got one it was pretty good, and I was impressed by the decor/cleanliness/service.  However, the second one I had was overly burnt (it was burnt when it got to my table, I started mixing it and a lot of the rice was already black). I was one of the few in the restaurant so it's not as though they messed up due to stress/business or anything. Two other people in the restaurant also ordered bibimbaps while I was walking out, and I could smell the burnt rice on those as well.  Probably not coming back."}
{"text":"I have only gone to this place for lunch during the week. I actually discovered this place on my way to another sushi place during my lunch break & decided to go in because it was a lot closer. That time I just did take out.  I have sat in there three times already for lunch & each time it's been packed! If you work downtown this location is pretty convenient.   The three times I sat in for lunch I was rushed to make an order & then neglected the entire time afterwards.   The food is really good & the bento boxes are always filling. Their rolls are really good too. I always order the lunch bento box with the teriyaki chicken & tempura combo (L6) & I haven't been disappointed. Their maki rolls are also delicious.   The last time I went the girl accidentally gave us the wrong order & was very apologetic. I found this interesting because some of the girls that work there have very smug looks on their faces & will often give dirty looks to customers when asked for something.   I would definitely eat here again. I would recommend the spicy salmon maki, green & golden maki & the lunch bento boxes. I just wouldn't expect superb service."}
{"text":"Horrible service, accused me to pay twice for a drink I never had, I only had water. They stopped my boyfriend and me from leaving after we paid the bill because they made a mistake although they only kept accusing us of the wrong orders.   Food is expensive for the quality and quantity provided. Never coming back."}
{"text":"Bapbo is a Korean restaurant, only throwing distance from Toronto landmark Dundas Square. Essentially prime location, perfect whether you're on work break or when too much shopping has made you hungry. Also particularly good if you're planning to head somewhere else for dessert after your meal as there are multiple neighboring bubble tea and sweet shops.  Sat in for a warm and filling hot bowl of pork soontofu, a spicy pork tofu stew. Comes with a bowl of japgokbap (purple rice) and standard appetizers.  No surprises here, tastes as it should but could've had the identical dish at the Korean resto across the street.  Would come back but wouldn't go outside my way to recommend to others."}
{"text":"One of the few Korean food places at the heart of yonge dundas my group went for dinner. They also served Japanese food here as well but I've never tried.  I order the seafood soon tofu. But instant regret cause when my friends ordered bibimbaps, they looked sooo good! It came in a hot bowl and everything was still sizzling. Protip: mix very well and scrap the rice on the bottom if you don't want your rice crunchy. It was my first time here, but my friends who eat here often say they jacked up the price. It's already pretty expensive though....  Need to come for their lunch specials though! Different bibimbaps each day for like $10. Still trying to find the perfect place that serves bibimbap though!"}
{"text":"Food is great, service is good!  Found on Dundas, this place is great for a quick meal around the area. However, there's about three other Korean alternatives, this one is great for quick food, and decent on the wallet compared to Korean restaurants around here.  I would recommended the rolls, Korean dishes, but avoid the ramen.  What I found here better than the rest is the dessert drinks. I don't think many had mentioned it but I would also recommend the:  Korean Cinnamon Punch;  One is the best desert drinks I had and this is the only place I know that serves it."}
{"text":"nice and clean. but the food doesnt taste like korean food at all. wasted so much money.. recommend not to go if you want to try the real korean food. Also, i wasnt satisfied with the service"}
{"text":"Their ddukbokki sauce is the worst and the rice cakes are undercooked. Bibimbap is also just average."}
{"text":"I was in a rush and needed something large and that would hold me over for a number of hours. Bapbo didn't disappoint. I came for lunch and was seated immediately. I quickly ordered the bibimbap special and did not have to wait long for the food to start arriving. I must say, it was quite a lot and quite tasty. By the time I was done I was definitely full. The service was very friendly and attentive. I would come here again."}
{"text":"I went here at around 12pm with someone, so during lunchtime. I ordered the bulgogi with rice and salad. For the price, I did not think that it was really worth it as they only gave me alittle of each. Also the waiting time for the food was a bit long but I wasnt complaining about it. The food itself was good but it didn't fill me up. On the other hand, the atmosphere was really nice and I'm glad I got to try it as I walled last this restaurant numerous times."}
{"text":"3.5 stars! My cousin and I came here on a chilly day and we decided to try this place out because I wanted Korean food and she wanted Japanese. The decor is reallllly cute! I loved the bamboo ceilings, the large picture of the cherry blossom tree and the bright wooden tables/chairs/booths. The restaurant is clean and service is attentive. We shared the KFC (Korean Fried Chicken) and it was okay, it wasnt like Boka/Bonchon and reminded me of Taiwanese popcorn chicken. We both liked the light and crunchy texture to the chicken though. My cousin ordered the snowman roll (Maki roll w/salmon, cucumber, avocado, crab meat topped with cream cheese) and it was huge! I ordered the budae chigae- large serving of piping hot stew with generous portions of sausage and spam! :) however, I found the soup to be a little bit too sweet, not spicy enough and lacked in kimchi. Overall it was a good experience, enjoyed the generous portions and would come back :)"}
{"text":"5 OF 5 Star!  Really terrific daily bibimbap specials and terrific rice cake!   To top it all off great service! And yummy unique side dishes.   We love it here. Been here since 2013.  On site manager is great, always treats us well!"}
{"text":"A perfectly average Korean place close to Dundas Square. I was in for lunch recently and had the chicken bibimbap. Everything was well-cooked and the rice had a nice crust on the bottom. But it was so bland, not something I generally associate with Korean food! Meat and rice cried out for seasoning. I ended up just putting a lot of hot sauce on. Friendly service and good banchan too."}
{"text":"I came here with two of my friends and it was so delicious!!!! Quick friendly service and great atmosphere. If i lived in this city I'd def come again!"}
{"text":"Decent restaurant. Bring, clean, relatively clean food. Side dishes are nothing out of the ordinary.   My shrimp tempura bibimbap ($9.95) was fresh and tasty. However, it was slightly misleading to cut two shrimp tempuras in half and serve it as if there were four shrimp tempuras.   Bapbo serves a different lunch special everyday of the week.  Overall, it is a decent option for lunch."}
{"text":"I went here the other day with my friend. It's a small little Korean restaurant. The staff there were very friendly and attentive. Their menu has most of the usual Korean food and Sushi. They did have baked sushi, which seemed really cool. We ended up getting fried japchae, tteokboki with ramen and baked sushi (grand canyon).  the fried japchae was very interesting. I really liked it. It's an appetizer. Basically the japchae are wrapped with seaweed, and then fried like tempura. Something different with japchae.   The tteokboki with ramen was really good. It was more sweet than spicy, which is good since I can't really take spicy. There were fish balls and fish cakes with the food.  It's a good dish to share. The tteokboki were cooked to perfection, nice and chewy.   The thing that got me hooked was the baked sushi. It was amazing. Nice fresh cooked salmon and eel in the middle with avocado and melted cheese on top. It was nice and warm when we got it, so I know it was freshly baked.   It's not a cheap place, and somewhat pricey, but given that it's pretty center downtown, I think the price is reasonable. I'm definitely going back for more sushi and maybe another round of Tteokboki."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times and it's always satisfied my Korean food craving. Probably not the most authentic place but the food is still okay.  The appetizers are small for the price you pay. My friend literally paid $7 for a single piece of grilled eel. She was not happy with that. Appetizer rice cakes are also a tiny portion.  I do enjoy their bibimbap though. They serve it with purple rice and actually have a sweet soy sauce instead of the usual spicy sauce. It's great for people like me who don't eat a lot of spicy things.  I rly like their tofu one, it's always deep fried nicely but it'll burn your mouth if you eat it too fast. Their banchan is a nice variety of things. The potatoes are bomb.   Seating is a little squished especially during rush hours"}
{"text":"I had quite a good experience here so I don't understand the negative reviews and would be happy to return! In fact, I kind of prefer them over their direct competitor across the street, even though they have slightly better reviews.  The decor is very charming. The seats aren't the comfiest but they get the job done and are not UNcomfortable. I found the servers to be very nice and more attentive than across the street - but I also came in quite late that day.  I really like the menu and the selection of food. I LOVE that there are single-person servings of budae jjigae, and I'm looking forward to trying both the gamjatang ramen (never seen that on a menu before!) as well as the kimchi fried rice (one of my fave comfort foods).  The budae jjigae was quite spicy for me - I had to keep sipping water - but it was tasty. I really appreciate that they use multigrain rice instead of white rice here - I mean, I usually prefer white but multigrain is better for you.  Looking forward to my next meal here!"}
{"text":"We ordered the Bulgogi Sizzling and Kalbi JJim for dinner (Sun 8pm).  Good: (1) Food was delicious. (2) Seating around was nice and clean.  Bad: (1) Service was terrible. We got 1 salad and when we asked if we were supposed to get 2 salads, the male server said yes but never brought it. Then we asked the female server and she gave it to us. Later we asked the female server for a second round of appetizers, she said yes. After 15 mins, when we asked her again, she didn't remember that we asked her. She finally brought it.  The restaurant was only 30% full but the two servers were running around (I would be worried if it was 100% full). (2) Their free WiFi was not very strong. Only managed to use it for 5 mins and then it wasn't strong enough. (3) Their credit card portable machine didn't work twice in a row. They had to try a second machine (which worked). Wonder if it uses their weak WiFi."}
