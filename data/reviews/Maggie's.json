{"text":"I'm sad to say that Maggie's is GONE.. it's now the College street Diner, and the decor is to say the least depressing, GREY, makes the space seem small and closed in..They did keep most of the menu but the food now is Sub-par. and gone is the small details like fresh edible fruit on the side of the plate, the orange juice isn't as fresh, the bacon was cooked to death, toast wasn't even toasted.  we waited around 45 min's for our food and when it came it was STONE COLD..at least when it was Maggie's it took a long time but the food always arrived hot. then comes the very Gross and disturbing part of the ordeal, I sat and watch the Prep cook, stick his fingers in his mouth 3 times and I mean a full on Molar scratch.. and then touch toast, fruit, and other items on people's plates, and I also saw the waitress bring someone a cup of tea holding the cup from the top with her fingers..to be honest I WON'T ever be going back to this place.. that finger in the mouth thing just super grossed me out and I just hope no one comes out of that place with HEP C or worse.."}
{"text":"I had been here 5 years ago ish and I dont think they've cleaned the place since. Its sad and embarrasing for the owners, whom Im sure are nice people. (But since we were barely spoken too, I cant even say the service was good) I didnt want to touch the salt shaker or the menu and used my napkin. The menus look like dogs got to them. Everything was dirty and gross. I couldnt even eat my food  because I was so grossed out by the surroundings. If they dont take care of the front of the house, whats going on in the back?? Shocked that this placed passed a health inspection.  I almost wanted to write the waitress (who was wearing jogging pants btw) a note to politely tell them to buy a sponge and soap.  If you like the garlic fries- go to Karine's on MccCaul St (food court) and you wont be disapointed.   The coffee was gross too so I promptly went to Manic and rejoiced in a real brew. Location is the best part abou tthis place. But I have better suggestions to consume food at and they are just steps away:  Aunties & Uncles, Mars Diner, KOS (Kensignton), Kalandar, Free TImes, Nirvana...."}
{"text":"Was looking for a place to have a decent breakfast.  Found this on Yelp! and decided to give it a try.  It's definitely a greasy-spoon, with décor and tiny wooden tables to match.  Service was nice; an older gentleman dutifully attended to our 3-person order.  The food was good - my fried egg was fried hard like I like it, and tasted fine.  The portion sizes are large - be careful what you ask for!  I had the classic French Toast which was pretty good, as well as a side of bacon and orange juice, which was definitely fresh-squeezed.  One major complaint I had was that everything wasn't very hot when it came out.  Also, the butter was quite cold and hard which made buttering toast very difficult!  Overall it seemed like pretty decent fare.  Nothing was overly sweet, nothing needed a lot of sugar, however, I felt like overall it could have been just a little bit better.  And warmer."}
{"text":"Went here the other morning for brunch, and it was delicious! I had to read some papers and was looking to get out of my apartment for a while, and this was a great place to do it. The restaurant had a great atmosphere; there was everyone from couples to friends chatting to families having a meal together. I had the #4, which is a garden omelette. Came with tea (you can get it with coffee, as well), an assortment of fruit (banana, watermelon, pineapple, and orange slices), the omelette which was pretty big, two slices of toast, and GARLIC FRIES. Which were GREAT. Actual clumps of garlic = delicious. The spare garlic got thrown into my omelette :)  All this for $12 including tip? Not bad at all. Definitely will be back :)"}
{"text":"In the hood & ducked in for tea. Place is quaint, cozy and ambiance with background jazz encourages lingering.  Sun-kissed establishment with two mini tables@ front... Perfect for people watching.  Will definitely come back for brunch.. Aromas are delish, patrons seem pleased and service is friendly."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Maggie's in a very long time. It's more of a university crowd (I think still). It still has the same decor (a little rickety). I remembered the great fries and big breakfast and we went in...others were full close by.   So first, no one came to sit us down, so we just grabbed a table that didn't have dishes on them (3-4 tables were not cleared of dirty dishes) - not a big deal.   It took a long time for us to order (the server rarely come out of the kitchen) - and there were only 2 tables eating in the resto at the time.   The omlette was ok, the salad was wilted - didn't really try to finish it and the garlic fries were very tasty, but definitely were not fresh.   Pros:   Big breakfast if you're super hungry.  Garlic fries Coffee  Cons:   The service was terrible (not that they were rude, just rarely came out and the dirty dishes on the other tables were never cleaned up).  Not so sure about the freshness/quality of the food.    Probably would never go back...but I'm quality over quantity, and to be fair, could have been an off day?"}
{"text":"I really like Maggie's, and always have, except now I'm a little bit scared since someone found a maggot in thier fitatta! Yikes!! I'VE personally never had any trouble with them. I really enjoy thier simple breakfast. The best part--GARLIC FRIES. So delicious!! Other that that, I think it's just a simple breakfast, nothing too special. The prices are a bit high (in my opinion) for just a simple breakfast, seeing as you can go across the street to Sneaky's and get a big breaky for about $3.25 on weekday mornings. BUT Sneaks doesn't have garlic fries!!!! mmmm...  I've found the service nice but just not too present, Maybe they need a bit more staff for those occaisional busy times (just in case your coffee cup or water become empty). But whenever I go in it's always pretty chill, not too busy, and warm and friendly service, a good meal!   I've taken a friend to Maggie's before, so I'd definitely suggest it for a quaint little breakfast place that people usually pass by!"}
{"text":"So I've walked past this place about a million times and never gave it a second thought until a friend said it's breakfast was just as good as Aunties and Uncles without the ridiculous line-up. I went today to see if the rumor was true and indeed it was. The breakfast menu has everything from the standard eggs and bacon to the imaginative eggs benedict with gypsy sauce. The place isn't very big but there are four little patio tables on the front sidewalk and great window seats. The prices are great and so is the food. I highly recommend this College Street gem if you're looking for a new, tasty breakfast spot.  FYI- There is NO SIGN, but rather a giant mosaic cup of coffee above the entrance so keep your eyes peeled."}
{"text":"I used Yelp as a guideline to find a brunch place on a short visit to Toronto and I found Maggie's. I really liked it. They serve fruits instead of a salad for your side. The service is slow though but when the food comes, you forget all about it."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good and well priced and there is definitely something for everyone on the menu. My complaint is the ladies room - it's gross. This place is busy, I'm sure they could manage to sink a few hundred dollars into some upgrades."}
{"text":"I walked out of Maggie's.  Two things can cause me to walk out of a restaurant: No vegetarian options, or maggots* in my food. Maggie's has plenty of vegetarian options.  *I'll append my comments to note that I only saw one maggot on my potato frittata, alive and writhing. One leads me to the presumption of more."}
{"text":"Des frites à l'ail au petit déjeuner avec des ufs Bénédicte pour un prix très modique ? Pourquoi pas ! Ce petit bijou qu'il faut fréquenter par un dimanche matin, vous retapera vos excès de la vieille."}
{"text":"one fav t.o brunch places. the wait times can be long. the garlic fries always deliver and I adore the hospitable south american owners. The food is generously large proportion. The stuffed french toast is amazing but can be bit like dessert for breakfast."}
{"text":"Maggie's is a a great restaurant with lacklustre decor and the problem of being to popular for its own good. The space is just too small and brunch at Maggie's requires a dedicated two hours because the service can be quite slow... I mean really, really slow.  The food is however stellar, the eggs benny is amazing and comes with generous sides including fresh fruit and fries deep-fried with so much garlic you can taste it infused into the oil.   This is a great restaurant that could really just use a restaurant makeover and perhaps some more serving staff."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast yesterday. wasn't really feeling anties and uncles. Decent breakfast and the garlic fries are good. I'm not sure if it really holds a handle to Sneaky Dee's across the way, but its okay."}
{"text":"Maggie's has a good location and no brunch lines so it's a great place to meet people for a weekend breakfast. Having said that it's nothing fancy or special in terms of the decor or even food (which is why there's no line I guess). It's simple, straight forward food at average prices. They have lots of choice on the menu, even for vegetarians or vegans which can be great. One nice thing is that they give you a choice between traditional hollandaise sauce or their tomato based house sauce which is actually very yummy (despite the fact that I find it slightly offensive that it's called gypsy sauce). Coffee was good and strong! Service was standard, but it's a tiny kitchen and in groups its common for the food to come out at different times leaving that awkward time where half the table has their food and the other half are desperately waiting."}
{"text":"Heard of this place through Pure Pwnage. Turns out they weren't just giving out publicity, this place is actually very good. They have the Maggie's ultimate breakfast which is delicious. It comes with so much food its wonderful!  The one thing I look forward to most when I go there though is the garlic fries. I don't know how they make them but this place has some of the tastiest fries in the GTA. Hit it up if you have a chance.  It's a bit hard to find since there is no big sign. They're sign consists of a standard white 8.5 x 11 printer sheet of paper taped to the window. So keep your eyes peeled!  It's not too clean, but clean enough that you don't worry about it. Service is friendly just a little slow when it gets busy. And as stated previously the food is delicious."}
{"text":"Some pros + some cons = 3.5 stars!  Came here for brunch today - was not disappointed.  For 3 people? $35 including tax and tip.  So reasonable.  The portions were pretty huge - well, at least mine was.  I had the peanut butter and banana stuffed french toast that comes with fruit and tea or coffee.  It was so good - it made me sad that I couldn't finish because there was so much of it.  I haven't had yummy french toast like that in long time!  The service is a bit slow - it is hard to find someone to refill coffee or hot water for tea.  Then it was hard to get the bill.  And it was hard to find a working bathroom, since there are 2 and one was broken.  This aside, my order was excellent.  I'm actually craving that french toast right now and sadly remembering the 1/4 of my meal I left behind."}
{"text":"Maggie's was a surprise find this weekend in Toronto as we wandered around looking for a quick brunch before a wedding ceremony. Maggie's dosen't look like much on the outside, and it's nothing fancy on the inside either. But, the service was good, the food was suprisingly plentiful and tasty and I'll come again next time I'm in the area looking for breakfast.   The main breakfast plate is under 9 dollars, comes with a side of fresh fruit and home fries (really really good) along with the standard eggs, meat and toast."}
{"text":"Wonderfully standard brunch with a beautiful twist to everything.  Every plate that came out of the kitchen was bursting with colour and I got a few awkward glances as people realized I was staring at them eating their food.    I got the 3 eggs and bacon breakfast, and everything was exactly what I wanted from a Sunday brunch.  In fact, I ate the entire plate, fruit, potatoes and all.  The bananas, oranges pineapple and cantaloupe were a nice touch and really completed the meal for me.  My only complaint was the side of sausages I ordered to share.  They tasted like they were frozen Costco sausages and lacked the squirting juiciness I expected.    There was a girl sitting at the next table that got a roasted chicken for breakfast (wtf really?) but it looked PERFECT.  I rarely order chicken out cuz more often than not it's dry, but this thing looked like it came straight from a magazine.  Definitely going to have to give that a try some time.  Simply a beautiful place to stop in and grab some brunch on a warm weekend morning.  Sitting outside right on College watching people bustle by, walking their dogs, or getting tattoos next door was heavenly."}
{"text":"Must have been one of those 'off, off' days.  It's boxing day. I've given up on shopping at 10:00am and I'm looking for a refuel on energy. We decide to trek over too College St for Aunties & Uncles: closed. Wanda's Pie in the Sky: closed. Kaplansky's; no longer serving twisters and turkey wasn't being served until 11:00am. Freezing, hungry and just wanting to make things easy we opt for Maggie's. I've never been a big fan, but Iess indecisiveness and more eating was an attractive option.   I ordered the vegetable omelette (mushrooms, peppers, onions and mozz cheese). MEH....It was edible and did the job of killing my hunger pang...but I don't like to eat to just get full. I'm looking for a full mind, body and mouth experience.   He ordered some Mexican specialty (3rd last on the menu) that looked very fancy. It was three eggs (however you like), beans, chicken and a slice of cheese. My boyfriend had to give it back because the chicken was over cooked, cheese crusty and the beans had an unusual taste. The waitress was very quick to respond and immediately brought him a different order.  I really believe they were having one of those 'off, off' days. Its the day after Christmas, so I'm thinking they didn't get a re stock on their dailies'. Maybe this is why Aunties and Uncles was closed. I've never been wowed by the meals at Maggies but always expect an okay meal. Service is friendly and they have a large menu of options for a fair price.  During the summer they open up their front windows and their two front seats are great for people watching.  The owners seem very lovely and I don't want to hurt their business but I won't be returning any time soon since I'm very picky when it comes to brunch. What can I say, I'm a brunch whore !"}
{"text":"Maggie's is my favorite breakfast spot in Toronto after a year since moving here. I try a new dish every time I go and haven't been disappointed yet.  Atmosphere is warm and inviting, and the wait staff are friendly.  This would be an automatic 5 star, but service is very scarce after you've received your meal and you'd be lucky to get a coffee refill without asking for one."}
{"text":"Maggie's in no longer my number one vacation breakfast spot in Toronto.  I had originally planned to eat breakfast at Maggie's every day of my vacation, but after just my second breakfast there those plans had to be changed.  I was disheartened by the fact that the espresso machine was broken, even though that is a forgivable offense. What I cannot get over is the fact that my steak was rough, rubbery and over cooked on both occasions when I ordered the steak and eggs.  The steak was still seasoned the same with fresh garlic and peppercorns and served with a side of fruit 3 eggs and style garlic fries and buttered toast.   I reasons that Maggie's is using a less expensive cut of meat... in order to cut down on food cost. However I could tell almost immediately.  I felt as if I were chewing the bottom of a leather boot.  Also I should mention that I ate my steak in eggs after 12:00pm, perhaps the save the really terrible steaks for diners who eat later in the day??? The jury is still out on that one.   My unhappiness was heighten because of a year worth of longing for steak and eggs, Maggie's to be exact, when the time finally came my steaks was barely edible.   This place has lost some of it's charm and appeal,  but I'll never forget the good times we've had in the past."}
{"text":"3.5, really.  Maggie's has a certain charm in its unpretentious nature. It's extremely casual, warm and inviting. The menu is welcoming but not typical, with creative twists in unexpected ways which just goes to show a lot of thought was put into it; always a good thing. For example, I had an Omlette Florentine (just under $10 tax in with a free cup of coffee, a nice touch), which is such a simple thing, but I'd never thought of making Eggs Florentine as an omlette. Portions are reasonably large, the food is well-prepared, and won't leave you stuffed-to-the-brim full. What Maggie's does right, I feel, is that it gets everything just right. Prices are decent, service is friendly, and the place itself is an interesting space.  What I had issue with was the overly casual pace. It's a good thing I went in with a lot of time to kill, because I needed all of it. I spent more than twice as long waiting for my food as I did eating it; fine if it's busy, but there were only four other people in the restaurant. I know it's not the place to go if you're in a hurry, but one of the keys of good service is to serve at your diner's pace, rather than the guest having to hunt down the server after twenty minutes of waiting for the bill because it's finally time to go. As well, the fruit portion was plentiful but clearly not the freshest.  However, Maggie's isn't trying to be a fine-dining or business-lunch locale, so for a laid back and satisfying meal that's just a bit different than the ordinary bacon and eggs, it absolutely hits the mark."}
{"text":"With kitschy, cobbled together decor that appears somewhat rickety and worn, one could be forgiven for thinking Maggie's is on the cusp of closure.  It's not, and thank your stars for that because this wee little cafe serves up an honest-to-goodness brekkie that's about too-good by half when compared to the price you'll pay.  This place is the very definition of good value!  Its simple menu is home cooking done well, with the little things that elevate it beyond most greasy spoons:  generous sides of fruit, fresh herbs for seasonings, presentation beyond just plunking stuff down on a plate.  Their sausages are fantastic, and I really should find out where they source them (or if they make them in-house).  Coffee is good, maaaaaybe a bit on the insipid side but I like my java STRONG, so I'm a bad judge.  It has good flavour, though, so I doubt most drinkers will be disappointed.  They served real cream -- or at least I'm pretty certain it was real -- not the cheapie half 'n' half or that crap that's got thickeners in it to trick you into thinking it's 100% dairy cream.  It sounds small, but it's one of the corners that's usually cut when it comes to a \"cheap breakfast\".  Finally, gotta mention its location -- steps from Kensington, which is always a plus.  Have a great breakfast in a quaint cafe, then hit up the hippies for some wicked shopping and people watching.    Maggie's serves as a great start to a beautiful Toronto day!"}
{"text":"Food:  Delicious.  I've been here many times and always tend to get the same thing.  I should probably switch it up but I'm in love with the #1.  The bacon is cooked to crispy, and it comes with a healthy dose of fruit. Prices are decent.  Service: Slow. Maggie's is usually busy, expect to sit and wait for a while."}
{"text":"So one saturday morning we decided to go for brunch. we initially wanted to go to aunties and uncles. but the waitress there told us our name wasnt on the list after 30 minutes of waiting (pretty sure I spelt my own name correctly when we came in). So we went round the corner to maggies. I had the felafel platter. It was very delicious. the hummus was particularly good considering that most places treat this as an afterthought. The service was quite good as well. I think there was only one or 2 people waiting on the restaurant but they were moving quite quickly and we never had to wait much for coffee refills or water."}
{"text":"The wait for our food took FOREVER! and it wasn't even packed! Food was mediocre and service was decent. My boyfriend and I wanted to try Aunties and Uncles but the lineup was way too long and I was getting cranky with hunger so we tried out this place. Would I go back? No. It was just not worth the wait for our food and it wasn't the most comfortable restaurant to sit in for brunch. I think there are many better options around this area."}
{"text":"Greatest garlic fries!!! Leaves you with awesome tasting burps all day                                              Love this spot"}
{"text":"I love Saturday night drinking binges because I know a Maggie's breakfast will be waiting for me on Sunday afternoon. Breakfast is my favourite meal of the day and I romanticize the act of eating breakfast as much as I romanticize picking cherries from my grandma's cherry tree or licking Ryan Gosling's face.   Maggie's is everything that breakfast should be and although the steep prices sometimes frighten me, they never deter me.   Firstly, Maggie's is adorable. It's decorated simply and modestly but its deco is as bright as its food, which makes me so, so happy!!!! The place is usually packed tight on Sunday mornings/afternoons but I've never had issues finding a spot to eat. They have a small patio and in the summers, they open up the space and let the not-so-fresh College Street air pass through.  Yes, as many have complained, the service is slow. It's always slow and probably the slowest service I've ever received in Toronto. AND SO WHAT!? It makes it that much more charming. If you're in a rush, go to Mars Food. Maggie's has a slow-paced, lazy-Sunday vibe. And if you don't like lazy Sundays then you should stay home, eat cereal and cry.   If you like orange juice, then please, please, please order a glass here. The orange juice is fresh and full of delicious pulp and I grew up thinking it was great for hangovers! The coffee's good too and since it's busy, the server needs to be reminded to refill your coffee. The servers are nice. Not too nice. They don't smile big or make small talk. They serve you, tend to your needs and they looks happy doing so. Don't expect to be coddled. These people are real.  I love smoked salmon so my favourite meal is the Oceanic Benedict. OMG, it's so divine, I can't even control myself as I write this. I am drooling on my keyboard as I type. HOLY GOD IT IS SO GOOD. It comes with garlic fries, which I love, and some fruit. This breakfast looks so beautiful on your plate (just like all their other meals) and when you bite into it, you feel like you're riding a unicorn on a rainbow and about to slide into a deep pot of gold, while an Irish leprechaun dances for you. Ahhhh, I'm dyinnnnggg!!!  HANDS DOWN, THE BEST BREAKFAST IN THE HISTORY OF ALL BREAKFASTS."}
{"text":"A rainy day and a hangover hung over my head and I diagnosed that a trip to Maggie's would do the trick. The thought of a plate of garlic fries and fruit, plus whatever else came on the plate, sounded like the ultimate cure to my achy Sunday.  The food was good but there was no heaping portion of garlic fries and the fruit included three thinly sliced pieces of banana. I plunked down $17 for an omelette and orange juice and Maggie's couldn't afford even an additional sliver of a banana? Disappointing.  Quick service, good omlette, but let's just say neither one of us is going bananas."}
{"text":"This place is cheap, cute and friendly.  It is a totally typical family-owned-and-operated style campus eatery, but I like the way they prepare their meals. Smart and with a good deal of fantasy.  Just don't expect some chef' marvels or a huge menu there - it is not a restaurant. It is a place where owners share something they like and know how to cook with the rest of us - with student-targeted prices.  Oh yes, the place itself is obviously not a palace - though it's clean, so I can not call it a \"rathole\". If you have a friend in UoT and would like to meet and chat - Maggie's will be a good choice for that."}
