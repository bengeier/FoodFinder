{"text":"Not even on a drunken night does this pizza taste good. We stopped in here after hanging out at the downtown bars because my girlfriend was craving pizza. Walked in and it was hotter inside than outside. Also, very muggy, like the swamp cooler stopped working. Anyhow, she ordered a slice and the guy behind the counter reached into the fridge and put her slice in the oven... Honestly, it had tasted worse than a burned Totinos pizza from the frozen section. Very bland, hardly any sauce or cheese, and I'm not sure if that was actually pepperoni. Do yourself a favor and save your money."}
{"text":"Not that good.

Deep dish pizza didn't have sauce on it!?! What's up with that? Crust was spungy and not that good. tasted  frozen..."}
{"text":"But only because EAT24 SUCKS and after an HOUR I called the restaurant who hung up on me. NIce way to treat customers so I suppose we will never know if they suck or not. YELP - way to go. 2nd time this failed."}
{"text":"Head's up!

Since it just opened they are selling 18\" one topping pizzas (or pie's as the owner called them) for $10, tax included.

My buddy and I came in looking for something quick and simple to fill the gut and hit the bars later. We werent counting on some serious pizza action. We got that special, it was served piping hot with just pepperoni. It was one of the best pizzas ive had in this side of town. The owner told us about the preparation and was very friendly and seemed very proud of his business. They'll start serving salads soon so I'll update on that then. 

They have a challenge for who can eat a very large pizza. If you can eat a 28\" pizza \"loaded with 3 pounds of cheese\" you get the pizza for free, get your picture on the wall and you get a \"I ate the whole 28\" t-shirt. I don't plan on trying this anytime soon, but it seemed interesting. 

We hit the bars later, and it was really nice to have that half a 18\" pizza there to help me along. 

They also have lunch specials, subs, salads, calzones and some other sides."}
{"text":"Bisquick crust perhaps? Not sure but it's god awful. Not to mention the middle eastern fella that owns the place could NOT have been less friendly. Now we know why we were the only ones in the restaurant!"}
{"text":"Ordered from grubhub using the online descriptions for menu items. Order was late, driver was lost. 

Order was completely wrong, antipasto salad had pepperoni and mushrooms, and they provided the wrong dressing. Onion rings, fries, and pasta were completely soggy, gross, and you could tell the food had just been sitting out for awhile. 

I called the store back, and a man with a heavy accent insisted that I had read the order wrong, and that there was no other staff or manager present. Began yelling at me, and insisting that he never has had a complaint and was refusing to return back the money in exchange for the untouched food.  Than put the phone receiver down and did not respond to anything I was saying.

Called the driver back, and he gave some bullcrap story about having to do another delievery, and than stated he already gave the money to manager.

Called back the store, and read the description of the salad, and explained to the major that the order was completely wrong. Again the manager argued and still refused to return back the money.

Just awful horrible service. This is how they treat their customers? How is this place even still alive."}
{"text":"We love Pizza Pizza. Good pizza and wings. The 20.99 deal with XL 1 topping pizza and 24 wings is great. Being from ny I'm pretty picky, so its nice to have this place nearby."}
{"text":"Decent food for delivery!
SPINACH RAVIOLI, VEGGIE PIZZA AND EGGPLANT SANDWICH. Ordered the Spanakopita but they called a few mi b utes later letting me know they didn't have it."}
{"text":"We received a flyer on our door for this place and thought we'd try it out. My boyfriend and I love our pizza and wings and are always willing to try new places. Too bad, we didn't look this place up on Yelp first. I called the Scottsdale location to place my order and the employee who answered was just generally rude and rushing me on the phone. When our food came 45 min later we were baffled by how disgusting and flavorless it was. It even smelled funny! We got an X-Large cheese pizza and 20 Wings. The wings were dry on the inside, soggy on the outside, barely had any sauce on them and smelled gross! Our pizza had too much sauce, the cheese refused to stay on the pizza, ridiculously greasy, and even though they tried to redeem the flavor by putting a huge amount of oregano and pepper on it, still tasteless! The only descent thing about this place was the prices but we discovered, in this case, you can't even get what you pay for. I really hope this place doesn't survive to kill anyone else's appetite."}
{"text":"I randomly walked passed a pizza place and told my wife that we should try it out. Coming from Chicago, we are always looking for a great pizza place in the valley. We took the pizza home and were shocked how good it was. We tried it again and I actually watched the nice man take his time on each pizza, as we ordered 2. He is a perfectionist and it comes through from the quality of the food. My family of 4 now goes there every week and it's truly our favorite place in the valley..Piza Pizza!!"}
{"text":"The Meat Lasagna was by far the worst I think I've ever eaten!! The layer at the bottom was so chewy you could barely cut thru it let alone chew or swallow it and the sauce was also very tangy almost sour tasting, they also forgot my breadsticks and the delivery guy was rude. Best part about it was my LITTLE piece of chocolate cake and the decent tasting cheese sticks. So much for trying somewhere new...NEVER AGAIN!!!"}
{"text":"Always utilized Yelp before (except in this instance), and never actually Yelped! myself. So the fact that this place was so atrocious motivated me to join and write a review should indicate where this is going. I ordered a pizza and wings from here a couple of nights ago at 5:45 in the evening, at seven I decided to call. The rude little teenager who answers the phone informed me that the driver was on the way and he should be here shortly, keep in mind he is already 45 minutes past when he said he would be here. But I consider myself a patient woman, however when my child is crying for food and the \"dude\" on the other end insists that the driver is coming from their joint a half mile from my house, patience wears thin. So fifteen minutes later I call back, and he tells me the driver is lost and is trying to find my house. When the pizza and wings finally got here. The pizza was cold and the crust was chewy and tore like taffy. The wings were OK, but cold. I tried to call the owner inform him of his shitty employee and my experience, and shockingly he is never there! I half way think the little Italian man I spoke with might have been the owner but avoids admitting so unless utterly necessary. I hate that I waste 20 bucks but at least it was only 20 bucks! I learned my lack of yelping lesson!"}
{"text":"This place has really awesome Strombolis.  I found this out a few months ago, when I was missing the East Coast.  Now whenever I need greasy goodness it's my go to spot.

Unfortunately it's never really busy.  So I'm writing this review so that people will check it out.  I don't want the only pizza place in walking distance to shut down."}
{"text":"Tried it once and will never go there again. The sandwich was almost empty and taste nothing but bread. Ordered fires was really small and they charged me $3!!"}
{"text":"4.5 stars!

Pizza was very good!  It seems to be a mix between NY and Philly pizza  (one owner is from NY the other is from PA).  Sausage was excellent...Very high quality."}
{"text":"The pizza and service are equally bad. The owner is about as friendly as you'd expect for someone that's been eating his own pizza all day."}
{"text":"Just received a delivery order from a super friendly guy from Piza Pizza.  Great hot wings and mozzarella sticks!  Prices were great and I'm impressed!"}
{"text":"Look,i don't know what the people who gave this place more than one star are smoking, but I could have used it today. Had to drop someone off. Lets give it a try i say to myself. Hmmm looks closed, lights off in the back. Wait a few minutes. Mysterious head pops up, comes out, takes my order. Must buy combo to get slice. Fine. Hmmm where do i sit. Lets try outside since every single table is dirty. Ok after 5 min a slice of cheese pizza is set before me. One taste and i couldn't tell if he gave me pizza or the box it came in. Look I love pizza. I'll even eat totinos, but two bites and i was gone. This place had to be a front for something. Maybe they have a hidden casino in the back. Maybe i didn't give the code word. Smuggling ring perhaps, cause it can't be a pizza place, that's for sure. Please close and make room for something eatable."}
{"text":"Most disgusting thing I've ever put in my mouth.  Seriously.

Walked into the place; walls are covered in graffiti.  It's hot outside and there is NO air conditioning.  The lady behind the counter was Asian; I was hoping for an Italian person (possibly with a family recipe), given the name of the restaurant.  All of those things should have been enough to tip me off, but it wasn't.

I decided to give it a shot.  I'm glad I did, just so I can advise people to never go there.  My wife and I got two slices and a drink.  The soda was canned and was so old the flavor was gone.  The pizza itself... was store-bought frozen pizza that was heated up.

The pizza looked ok and had an OK texture, but tasted like NOTHING.  No flavor what-so-ever.  I didn't know it was possible to take the flavor out of cheese and tomatoes, but I guess if you freeze it for long enough, it's possible.

Do yourself a favor and go to anyplace other than here.  Go to the jack in the box across the street and you'll be more happy."}
{"text":"I was walking around downtown, yesterday. I decided to try their pizza. I had a slice and a soda. Absolutely, the worst pizza, I have ever had! Crispy and tasteless. I will never go there again!  And would recommend that no one eats here!

The only reason, I gave it one star, is that Yelp would not let me give it none."}
{"text":"I am from the NY area so I have very high standards for pizza and majority of the pizza in AZ is below my standards but this was absolutely awful.  The pizza wasnt even made fresh today, or maybe even yesterday.  For all I know the way it tasted and looked it could have a been a week old, but who knows.  All I know is he pulled the slices straight out of the freezer and then threw them in his quick conveyor oven thing.  Flavorless cardboard is more what it tasted like.  Would not suggest to anyone...  He also put garlic salt, pepper, parm cheese and oil over the pizza after it cooked, not a problem since I like most of that stuff but that decision should be left to the person eating the food.

Not to mention it was so hot inside I could barely even stand being in there, the walls are covered in filth and writing and all sorts of obscenities."}
{"text":"Everything is halal per owner.  We order Gourmet Chicken Pizza and it wasn't bad. The turn off point for us was when the owner charge $17.99 instead of $16.99 as advertised on his menu. Upon inquiry he acted that nothing was wrong and kind of argued with us on how his system had the right price. Here is the funny part though; $16.99 was not only listed on his paper menu but on his board menu and on his website too! So why he is charging $17.99 and then acting up that he didn't know about it at all is beyond my understanding. Good thing we noticed but imagine how many people have just paid whatever was told?"}
{"text":"Ate here today as my kids wanted pizza for lunch and they sold it by the slice. Ordered 2 slices of pep, 1 sausage, a house salad, 3 drinks. $20. Out of Italian dressing so I req. oil and vinegar. 

we sat outside and they brought the pizza out. They brought two slices on 1 paper plate and only 1 or 2 forks even though there were 3 of us. So i sent the lady back inside for more utensils, another plate, and napkins. The pizza was dry and tasted like it had been nuked. The salad was plain and almost ALL oil...where was the vinegar? Salad nothing but iceberg lettuce, olives, onions, and tomatoes and only oil for dressing. 

VERY disappointed at crappy service and crappy pizza. Lots of great bars and stuff to do in that area so skip this place."}
{"text":"Worse pizza I have had in a while. We ordered 3 slices and they tasted like they had been sitting out for a while and nuked. Crappy service too. Salad was plain and all oil no vinegar for dressing. . Service half ass. I am surprised they have remained in business fo several years. Also they apparantly have no AC it was VERY warm inside even on a slightly chilly day in Nov so we sat outside the inside was so hot and stuffy. this place totally sucks."}
{"text":"Im from the east coast and the pizza and strombolis did it for me. Im going back.
Owner was cool and the place though small was kinda like back home"}
{"text":"Looking for a place to have pizza with three adults and six kids...we order a large and medium which was exactly enough for all to walk away full.  I thought the price was pretty inexpensive and the pizza was really good.  The service was great and the folks working there were very kind to the kids, warning them to be careful with the fresh-from-the-oven pie.  Would go back in a heartbeat (and having just come from visiting Italy, I do know the real thing from the fakes....!)"}
{"text":"Horrible food. Arizona cheese steak horrible microwave food black rotten onions . Oil the wings are fried in taste old. The guy running the place is a unsanitary jerk. Place is full of flies, found hair in the sandwich. The owner overcharged me. Stay away Zero Stars! Place should be shut down."}
{"text":"It's a small space, brightly lit and somewhat barren.  A couple of wobbly ceiling fans waved to me as I entered, and a short, friendly man popped out from behind a tall counter.  He was a nice guy, super eager to please.

I waited a little while for my pizza, and it appeared that the short man was the only one on duty, and most likely always is.  Turns out they deliver, and the menu shows an offering that expands beyond the restaurants misleading name of Pizza to the second power.

The pizza is actually quite good.  It's blatantly apparent that the cheese and sauces are higher than average quality.  The prices are decent for a pizza shop, and they have a few specialty pizzas that help strech your dollar.  It's a fun and simple atmosphere, but don't let the rundown appearance distract you from a tasty meal."}
{"text":"I took Melissa's car to the dealer for service today.  After a few hours sitting in the waiting room and listening to light hits ranging from Kelly Clarkson to Enrique Iglesias my stomach began to grumble.  I perused the vending machines and initially considered going with the BigAZ Bubba Twins Chili Dogs until I came to my senses and decided to venture out into the world in search of sustenance.  Across the street I spied what looked like ancient adobe dwellings.  As I got closer a sign indicated that it was the dilapidated ruins of Pappago Plaza.  Through my explorations of the prehistoric temple to the gods of home furnishings and strip mall bars, I was drawn to both the British Open Pub and the Hometown Buffet next door, but neither was right for a meal before noon.  Just as I was about to give up on my quest I spied a single word that drew me in...PIZZA.  

As I walked closer I noticed the magic words...\"2 slices for 3.99\" and I was sold.  I entered the tiny hut and it appeared to be empty.  After a few seconds the phone rang and a tiny Italian man stepped out from behind a door.  He answered the phone and spoke something I didn't understand in a thick Italian accent.  After hanging up he asked me what I wanted, at which point I ordered one slice of cheese and one slice of pepperoni and a Pepsi.  After giving him my $5.27 he retreated behind the door from which he came and I took a seat at one of the 2 tables in the cramped and poorly maintained hut.  After a few minutes he returned with my slices.  

The slices were good size, but smaller than typical New York pizza with a thicker and softer crust.  I went in search of spices (a must for any good Pizza joint) and found only red pepper and parmesan.  Disappointed, I started with the cheese slice.  It was a bit on the chewy side, sort of like a poor man's Hungry Howie's, but was very bland and without the flavored crust.   As for the pepperoni, they were limp and soggy and tasted like some dog treats smell.   By that I mean it's intriguing to the point where you almost want to eat it, but you know it's not a good idea.  Luckily they were easily removed to convert it back into another bland cheese slice.  The best part was probably the crust, which was soft and tasty and could have been great with the right dipping sauce.  

I returned from my quest having not discovered any hidden treasure, but at least alive and with a full stomach...which is more than I can probably say if I had gone with the chili dogs!"}
{"text":"Last week I stopped by here for a quick lunch with an associate.  We saw the advertisements on the window for 2 slices of pizza and a soda for $3.99.   It seemed like a good idea to stop in for a quick lunch.  The place was quiet on a Monday at around lunch time.  The atmosphere of Piza is \"divey\" with writing and personal pictures on the wall.  I have to say I did like the atmosphere otherwise my rating would be a mere one star.

The pizza slices were pulled out from a refrigerator and reheated.  Each slice had that slightly burnt toaster oven look and feel to it.  I want to say that the cheese pizza tasted like reheated Costco pizza, but that would be a kind exaggeration.  It tasted more like warmed over supermarket chain pizza.

I was relieved that the price of the lunch was merely $3.99.  In all fairness, this lunch by far was the most affordable lunch I have had since my company moved to downtown Chandler.

Overall, I found humor in my experience.  The pizza was so awful that I had to laugh.
This one I am not recommending!"}
{"text":"Not your typical greasy, fat-laden pizza. I've tried the White, Works and Veggie. All were made with very fresh ingredients. If all you've had is Papa Johns (it's been sucking lately) and other delivery-style pies, and are interested in trying pizza with a \"cleaner\" taste, give them a try."}
{"text":"If you're tired of the same old Pizza Hut, Papa John's, Dominos pizza all the time, give this place a try! Owned and operated by one person so its clear he doesn't advertise well or have a website, and the place has a bit of a dull look. To be honest I've never dined in here. I always take my order to go. The place is empty most of the time and it's sad to see he's losing all the business solely because of lack of proper advertising. That's the only reason I can think of because the food is excellent. I go here at least once a week! The cheese they use is spectacular and the gyro specialty pizza is a must try! TRY IT AND YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT. I hope this place thrives because honestly, I'd hate to see it go. Btw, for those concerned, their meat is Halal!"}
{"text":"I just ordered from this place. The pizza took forever and both pizzas were terrible. The toppings and cheese all slid to one side, with a third of it completely off the pizza and the pizza was cold when it arrived. Also, I ordered spinach on one of my pies. What they call spinach is not fresh, but rather frozen spinach that they threw on top of it. It is awful.  I will NEVER order from here again nor do I recommend that anyone else does."}
{"text":"Seedy. Same guy that takes your money, walks back to prep your food. Salad lettuce tasted unwashed. Pizza toppings were ok, but dough and crust unacceptable."}
{"text":"I'm hungry and surrounded by some of the best spots in Chandler to eat. But I'm short on time and see this kinda funky Pizza Joint. How bad can it be...? Clue one - place is empty, clue two - the guy pulls everything out of the fridge to make 2 pizza slices?? Hmmm not selling enough to keep under a warmer. Getting nervous...It was about 3:15PM so.. maybe I'm just being silly..I ordered one cheese and one pepperoni, 6 minutes later, I was provided 2 pepperoni slices. Ummmm..\"I ordered.....\" pretty much got a shrug...okay then. Being short on time, I'll just slam these suckers down and be on my way. Yeah, I'm a food snob, but I also have a \"just eat to eat rule\" but that did not even work. I could not finish these things, I only ate as much as I did out of curiosity, trying to see if I ever had pizza this bad..frozen, kid place or mall.... Nope, this is by far the worst pizza ever. All it would have taking was 20 seconds to check the YELP Rating. I have no clue where these 3 and 4 star ratings are coming from..."}
{"text":"Just awful. Way undercooked crust. It was supposed to be a thin crust but might have been an attempt at a \"double dough\". The crust was barely even dry, not a spot of browning anywhere.

The \"Sicilian Deep Dish\"  was the same crust as the thin BUT they turned up the edges. Woo Hoo! NOT a deep dish. The mushrooms smelled like used socks. The 

The medium buffalo wings were tasty, but PLAIN wings. A little grease and hot sauce at the bottom. 

The delivery was over an hour when promised in 30 minutes. 

At over $50 for this meal I can only be grateful I don't have to order from them again. I'd rather have had a slice of white bread with a bottle of ragu and swiss. Yeah, that bad.

What a shame. If you were a fan of the Zza's - the pizza place that used to be here - AVOID the new place at all costs!!"}
{"text":"Being an avid wing fan lover I am one to go exploring in search of the best wings in town. And boy, this place was not it! Upon ordering, an Italian man which I believe was the owner was rude and seemed like was not satisfied with his job. I asked for 20 wings for $16 which I thought was a bit high. After retrieving my wings I payed the guy and seemed like he wanted me to leave a tip. Well excuse me, I only leave a tip if the service was great and I actually got served. No the wings were \" to go\" so no tip left. Now to the wings, man they weren't good at all. They were dry, overcooked, and sauce was not good at all. Seemed like store bought franks red hot as I got the medium wings and BBQ sauce was bland as well. Overall service and food needs to be improved and I \"may go back.\" Disappointed yelper! :("}
{"text":"What a strange experience.  I went in to buy a single slice of pizza at 7pm.  The place looked closed, but the \"OPEN\" sign was lit and I wanted to support the local downtown Chandler shop.  (I had been here two years ago and had a total disaster of an experience.  I knew the place had to have new owners by now.)

I stopped in, ordered my slice with pineapple for $2.49 and got a can of Diet Coke.

\"$4.24.\" says the nice lady behind the counter.  So, I gave her my credit card.  The bill I signed said $4.94.  I thought I might have heard her wrong at the beginning, so as she heated my pizza in the microwave, I asked a man, presumably her husband, what the story was.

As I suspected, they charged me extra for charging such a small purchase.  No problem, but I would have preferred to have been made aware before I used the card.

So, while I wait, I pop open my Diet Coke and it had no flavor. (We have this same problem at the office.  You buy a bunch of diet soda from Sam's Club and by the time you drink it, it is like bad club soda.)  So, at first I thought to myself, I don't want to bother this guy, but then I thought to myself, \"These people work damn hard, they are trying to start a business.  They would want to know that there soda is bad.\"

So, I said to the man, \"I think the soda has expired.  It has no taste.\"  I didn't ask for a refund and I was going to let it slide.  I just needed something to wash down the pizza.

Well, this really pissed the guy off, so he turns to the woman warming my pizza and says, \"Put a hold on that order!\"  He pulls out five bucks out of the register, hands it to me, and non-verbally indicated that I should get out of his restaurant.

Now, I was willing to put up with:

- expired, flavorless soda
- microwave pizza
- a 20% surcharge on my bill without my knowledge.

and this guy kicks me out of his restaurant!

I try so hard to be pro-small-business, pro-local-guy, but this was like a Twilight Zone episode.

Ironically, when I went here two years ago, I had an equally strange encounter.  

Now, it is possible that the immigrant owners did not understand that I was just trying to clarify the credit card issue for future reference and my complaint about the soda was just to warn him and help any future customers.  But, I was in a bit of a hurry already and I didn't want to dig any deeper.  

Honestly, I feel bad for the couple.  I'm sure they are working hard, but maybe they aren't made for the pizza business.  I hope it works out because frankly I'd like to see them succeed and having a pizza place in Downtown Chandler makes a ton of sense."}
{"text":"Worst pizza I've had in the state of Arizona... no, wait... ever. I work in a hospital and I'd rather eat the dried out cafeteria pizza any day over this crap. 

I dont know who decided it was a good idea to change the name of the business on Yelp (it used to be Zzzzas Pizza) instead of closing Zzzzas and opening a new business as Piza, but it was a terrible idea. Now it looks like Piza Pizza has much better reviews than it does... don't be fooled. 

I walked in and the owner was short with me and rude when I asked him what kind of pizzas he had fresh for me to buy a slice. He told me he had every kind of pizza ready. Huh?? So, I ordered a piece of sausage pizza and watched as they threw some sausage on an old piece of pizza and sent it into the warmer/oven. It came out hard as a rock. Nasty. 

Also, It's the month of June in Arizona and 110 degrees outside... it's about 120 degrees inside this place. He had the doors propped open and the ovens on. Looks like someone's a cheap ass trying to save on AC costs. Who the heck would want to dine at your restaurant?"}
{"text":"Dude. BARF TIME. 
FIRST of all, I ordered for delivery. The delivery driver got lost and I ended up having to walk down to the corner to meet up with her. (I still tipped her because I'm not a total dick, by the way). 
I ordered two pies, one with pepperoni/pineapple and one sausage and green pepper. At first glance, I thought they messed up my order and put pepperoni on both, and forgot the green peppers. When I looked closer I discovered that their sausage is small and sliced thin, like pepperoni. I also discovered teeny tiny slivers of green peppers, about an inch long. Each topping, and we're talking by the piece of topping here, had about  a 3/4 inch of cheese between it and the next topping piece. So the place goes stinge-o on you in regards to dressing a pizza. Also, the crust was soft and flavorless. Tasted like a cross between a wheat tortilla and the cardboard box it was sitting in. (Please note, this was NOT a whole-wheat crust.) And the next day? The leftovers were so bad they went into the trash. Not a fan."}
{"text":"I was so excited to see the gyro sign. I don't know what they served me exactly but it wasn't a gyro. I took pictures because I have never seen thick cut jerky in a pita covered with mayo and lettuce. I felt worse for my husband, he ordered their eggplant sub. The parts that weren't burnt were soggy with grease. The burnt onion rings were the best things we were served. The service was less than friendly, we felt like ordering food was a bother even though we were the only customers in the 40 minutes we were there. It is so close to home but not worth it. $22 for lunch for 2, half of it was thrown away."}
{"text":"I wanted something quick, hot, tasty, and cheap. While you chew on that sentence, let me just say, the pizza is good. It is, in fact, quick, hot and tasty and cheap. I went with the works - to go. You are not going to be eating here unless you want to crash with the drivers inside the restaurant or sit out on the common walkway at a patio table - probably not. Mingling with the window shoppers in downtown Chandler while you eat is overrated. The works topping were fresh, as in fresh tomatoes, fresh mushrooms, great canadian bacon and excellent sausage. I will be back."}
{"text":"Arrived at 6:30pm and not a soul in sight, but Ive had pizza from this place about 2 yrs ago and it was good. So, I was concerned but still decided to give it a try. 

I tried the Philly Steak and cheese sandwich.  It is advertised on a large sign for $6.99 outside the restaurant listing, steak, mushrooms, onions, green peppers and pepperchinis. The drink fountain was broken and thus only can sodas for $.89 or water bottles were available.  Waited about 10 minutes for the sandwich. The bread was soft but unimpressed with the sandwich taste  overall. Missing the mushrooms and pepperchinis as advertised. The meat tasted like it suffered from freezer burn and all the grilled onions on the planet couldn't mask the taste.  Not having this again... 

Cleanliness : The floors were dirty, which is weird since the place was empty. So the least you can do is clean up the place since theres nothing else to do. I sat next to the front restaurant window and noticed dead mosquito bugs all along the window sill.  Again, cleanliness is next to Godliness....not at this place. 

Cost: Philly steak and cheese with a can root beer total: $9.68.  ($6.99 + .89 +tax $1.80) =$9.68
   This is weird since Scottsdale's sales tax is 7.95%.
     Thus $6.99 + .89 = $7.88 @7.95 tax = .$63
       So my total price should have been: $7.88+.63=    $8.50... (Or rounded up to $8.51) So I was overcharged for my meal. Not good when you are trying to get customers. 

Service: only one person in the restaurant working the grill, cashier and as a server. But seemed like a friendly guy. 

However, not enough to overcome cleanliness, food flavor, and restaurant integrity.   Cant give this place more than one star.  Will not eat here again and recommend you do the same."}
{"text":"If i could give zero stars i would.    calling what i ate a pizza would be an insult to pizza.    hands down worst pizza i've ever had."}
{"text":"One star is an insult.   Worst pizza I've ever had - I would rather have 5 day old pizza left in my car than this.   How this place is still in business is beyond me."}
{"text":"Why and how is this place still in business??? This has to be the worst pizza in town. Seriously this place has got to be a cover for a drug operation or something. When we went in the guy seemed like he would prefer if we weren't there!

The pizza slices we got had apparently been sitting out for awhile.

Bad BAD BAD"}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY LOUSY!! When I was there the owner was fiddling with his tablet and came off as rude. All I wanted was a slice of pizza and a drink. He rudely told me, \"we don't serve pizza by the slice.\" You are a pizza shop. What pizza shop does don't sell pizza by the slice? Not seeing anything else I was dying to have (and they were expensive, and did not have drink prices listed), I ordered a side salad and an Extra Large Diet Coke. The cup he gave me was a 20 oz cup. I would hate to see what a small is. My total was under $5, and they could not accept my debit card for payment. Once again, there wasn't even a sign telling customers that. I told this foreign man who was obviously inconvenienced by someone coming into the place, to take his food and his lousy service and shove it up his ass. I left and will NEVER return. I suggest you don't, either."}
{"text":"Alright, the guys who work here were all very friendly; however the food was terrible. We got meatball subs. The meatballs were crusted over from either frying or sitting out... Not sure. The fries were too salty. I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"The Best Pizza is now at Teatro Pizzeria in North Scottsdale. It is not to be missed. The Pizza maker has been brought over from Rome, where he has been making Pizza for Oder 30 years. It is located in the Summit Mall on North Scottsdale Road.They make calzones which are to die for. You must go!!! open for lunch too."}
{"text":"Really close to the best western Papago, which is great. Bout a two minute walk from our room. They have a big selection (pizza, pasta, salad, wings, sandwiches, cheesesteaks). Not too expensive. The food is what you would expect from a place like this--not bad, but not the greatest. Not for someone looking for a fancy meal, but for this who want fast, convenient food, it's a good option."}
{"text":"I know, I know...after all the bad reviews, why? Because I like to form my own opinion AND...there hasn't been a review in a long time. So, I ordered the white pizza and it was just a ton of cheese. I could not taste the ricotta at all. The cheese sticks were cold which made them hard and the breading super crumbly. Not good quality. The 2 stars are for being here in a timely manner."}
{"text":"The pizza is pretty good but seemed a bit over priced  for the product. A large (14\") 2 topping cost almost $16 with tax and was average size with an average amount of toppings and cheese. 

I did enjoy the pizza but if you're expecting a true new york style the crust seemed a little thicker than it should; and the taste is about average. The sauce is far from bland with a little bit of a kick to it that I rather enjoyed. 

If I could find coupons and get this pizza for about $5 less I would definitely return since they are open until 3am on the weekends but otherwise there are better choices for the price."}
{"text":"I doubt this place will be in business by 2016. Gyro lacked meat, pita bread stale, sauce was okay. Same guy who rings you up and handles your money, will go straight to preparing your food. No gloves, no washing. I usually go to Mikas Greek that is literally .2 miles away but I figured I would try this place out and I deeply regret it."}
{"text":"Walk the other way, just walk right the hell the other way...

Here was how this played out.  Oktoberfest a few days ago.  Starting the night off.  I walk past this place and see a place that sells a slice of pizza for $1.99.  Good, right?  No.  

me: \"Hi, one slice of pizza please\"
guy: \"you buy drink with it, 4 dollars.\"
me: \"no, just one slice of pizza\"
guy: \"we do not sell one slice, you have to buy a drink.  4 dollars\"

I should have pulled a flag on this play at this point, but knowing I was going to be drinking I move forward wanting food in me. Not a wise move.

me: \"so, I can't buy one slice?\"
guy: \"no, you buy a drink with slice, 4 dollars.\"
me: \"It doesn't say that anywhere on the menu or walls\"
guy: \"No, do not sell one slice.
me: \"what the... O.K., give me 2 slices of pizza\"
guy: \"you buy two slices then.\"
me: \"yes, Jesus Christ, yes\"
guy: \"toppings?\"
me: \"no, no toppings.  cheese.\"
guy: \"we have toppings.\"

what is this guy, fucking deaf? 

me: \"no thanks\"

I give him the money.

guy: \"it take 10 minutes, you wait.\"

I don't think they run the air conditioner in this place, so I wait outside.

Pizza comes out.  Tastes like absolute crap.  I eat it outside because in September in Chandler Arizona it is cooler outside then inside this place.  I think they had the thermostat set to \"HELL\" Guy working or running the place comes outside and stares me down as I am eating.  I'm sure if you want to eat here you can check the dumpster for plenty of slices to try beforehand to avoid having to pay for one.  Excuse me, avoid having to pay for two.  However after what I had served to me I'm pretty sure they will beat you to the garbage cans and sell it back to some other unsuspecting soul.  I was the only one dumb enough to finish all the food.  Wouldn't eat here if there was a natural disaster and this place was the last to be ransacked for provisions.  I'd keep walking.

FAIL."}
