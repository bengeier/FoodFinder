{"text":"Im a Mississippi girl living in a Las Vegas world and i have to say this restaurant keeps me on top of my southern seafood cravings especially with the spicy seasonings. Absolutely love this place. If i  dont eat here at least once a week i get anxiety lol... Must Visit"}
{"text":"This is my absolute go-to spot when in Tempe. Love the food and service! Our serving crew, led by Nicole was A+. Great food, excellent service, and conveniently located close to ASU. THIS IS A MUST STOP RESTAURANT!"}
{"text":"Disappointing.  The hot and juicy blend was very diluted. Had no flavors what's so ever."}
{"text":"Like seafood? Do yourself a favor and head in - order the hot n juicy crawfish and some Cajun fries (you need about 1.5lb per adult) Just be prepared to get personal with you food... It's a delicious mess :-)"}
{"text":"The food here was great!... once we finally got it. We had a party of 9 and they brought out all the food seperatly. By the time i got mine 6 people were done eating already. Out of 10 i give the food a 9 but the service gets a 5."}
{"text":"4 stars instead of 5 because they were out of fresh crawfish and the frozen ones were nasty AND we waited for about an hour on a Tuesday night!  However, the crabs and shrimps were very very very yummy! I have yet to try Boiling Crab....will need to try this soon to see how it compares."}
{"text":"This is the worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant in my life. I brought my best friend here to celebrate his birthday hoping for a great night, but left greatly disappointed. When we entered the restaurant, there were 4 servers at the hostess station and not a single one of them looked up and acknowledged us. A couple even walked past us without looking in our direction. I had to ask who the hostess was! The food was okay, but the service did not make up for the lack of an enjoyable experience. I will not be returning to this restaurant."}
{"text":"The food was okay. Not the best crawfish I've ever had but it was pretty decent. The customer service was great though. Prices were also okay."}
{"text":"Geeezzzz....just order a pound of everything, it's all great AND a Corona back. Service is extraordinary, all rookies who visit get a demonstration on how the peel n eat works. \"Tip well.\""}
{"text":"If I could just rate the food, it'd be 5 stars but in this case the two stars go for the terrible customer service.  I've given this location 2 try's and both experiences were shitty.  The guy with the beard who works the front attended us both times. He never greeted us when we got in or when we left. The first time we went, we ordered king crab and he forgot to give us the crackers for it so we had to ask for that. He didn't give us gloves so we had to ask for that. I ordered water and when it came, there was no ice (which wasn't a big deal) but when I asked for ice he never came back. The second visit, we ordered a pound of crawfish but there was only about 4 or 5 full bodies and the rest of the \"pound\" was just claws."}
{"text":"If you asked Hot Juicy was one of my favorite restaurants. We started off at the Tempe location and once Glendale opened started coming to this location closer to home. The service has not always been that great long wait time and some bad waiters but the food has been so amazing we continue to come back. Well that has changed this location has decided to delude there sauce anyone reading this beware! The raise there prices and are giving you watered down sauce. Tonight prior to ordering I asked the waitress to please ensure my sauce is thicker as last time we visited we were told the cooks were still learning and we had to wait for a new batch. I was assured today the senior cook was there and I would get my order correct. Well that is not what happen the sent someone to my table to tell me it is what is and if you want my manager she will advise the same. I was appalled and asked to speak to the manager anyway. I told Maggie listen we have been a long time customer and you can't tell me this sauce is good. Maggie informed me not only has store been making it wrong but so has Tempe that the sauce in front of me is what it should be like runny and no flavor just some red watered down sauce. That was it no I apologize let me make this right. It even gets better. I ask for her mangers card as I want to make a complaint and I get a blue sticky note with a number. Well I did call no answer but what do you expect it was a blue sticky note. It's unfortunate I truly was one of there biggest fans but now will be one of there biggest complainers. I have already made a complaint with corporate and will hope this is not what they stand for as a corporate restaurant."}
{"text":"Hot N Juicy is a super fun place- you definitely need to go here once, especially if you've never had crawfish.  That being said, next time I will be skipping the crawfish and opting for shrimp instead.  Crawfish are a TON of work for pretty much zero meat.  Yes you can suck the head, but it tastes like the murkiest part of the ocean and it's an unappealing, brown mushy substance (perhaps their tiny brain?).  Gross.  You order by the pound, and your meal comes with a boiled potato & corn on the cob.  They have calamari and other apps, as well as dinner rolls and rice.  The seasoning is where I give this place 4 stars.  You have your choice of seasonings (garlic butter, cajun, lemon pepper, etc)- the \"hot n juicy\" being a combination of them all.  You then choose from mild, med, spicy, and extra spicy (be forewarned that nothing is truly mild here).  You can choose from crawfish, shrimp, crab, etc. and all require work- but the shrimp yielded much more meat.  The sauce (I ordered medium) was heavenly- next time I will be opting for the shrimp and getting a side of rice to act as a vessel for this delicious fire sauce.  Definitely a simple concept, but lots of fun- especially w/ a group.  Oh- and be ready to wear a bib & get MESSY!"}
{"text":"I LOVED the food from Hot N Juicy Crawfish.  I loved the spice of the sauce, the fun of eating with my hands (gloves on of course), wearing a plastic bib....oh yeah and the food.  The crawfish was spot on and delish, the corn and potatoes were amazing drenched in the sauce...angels played harps in my head as I ate each bite.  The fried catfish was dirty tasting just the way a good fried catfish should be, and the Cajun fries were incredible.    With all that said, the whole \"good for kids\" part of yelp that says yes should have a discriminating clause that says not for 20 month old toddlers in a booster seat.  3 spilled drinks, dirty hands in plastic gloves, and an untied down toddler made for an interesting experience to say the least.  I will be back with my appetite sans offspring for another few pounds of boiled shellfish heaven."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat in Vegas! Went here twice during our trip. Great customer service. Food is to die for!! Love everything about this place!"}
{"text":"its all about the experience. you gotta mix it up. this place puts your grub in a bag. no plates or utensils just your hands and a bib. we went sat. night. did not wait long. great music, the staff was happy and energetic. we had 2 lbs shirmp and 1 pound of crawfish, cajun fries, rice, 3 sodas for under 50. all was great."}
{"text":"Love this place! Way better than Boiling crab  Service is ok.   Food is always great!   I recommend the Cajun fries and a pound of whatever with the hot n juicy special mild. I can definitely take some heat, but be careful when you order because they definitely take it up a notch!"}
{"text":"I have been to this place twice and ordered 2lbs of crawfish each time. I usually get the hot n juicy special which is a mixture of all the other flavors. I like spicy foods so of course I had to get it spicy. Overall not bad, I've had better for a cheaper price but in Vegas you can't go wrong with Hot N Juicy for your crawfish fix. Did not try anything else other than the cajon fries which were pretty good also...  I believe the price is about $10/lb of crawfish, you have to order at least two lbs in order to get the corn and potato which I found odd because I have been to places that gives you corn and sausages with your order. Anyhow you have to give this place a try, just don't go here for dinner if you have plans on going out because you will smell like HOT n Juicy Crawfish when you leave haha.  Enjoy"}
{"text":"I love spicy shrimp. You can choose spicy one and when you eat two or more, you cannot feel you tongue. Although it is expensive restaurant, you can reconmmend your friends to come with you, and your freinds and you will enjoy a spicy and delicious meal. I strongly recommend spicy shrimp and crab leg."}
{"text":"Came here twice in two days. Came here all the way from uk and you didn't disappoint me at all. I wasn't keen on the hot n juicy special But my husband loved it. I loved the lemon pepper. We tried crawfish shrimps clams lobster crab legs oysters soft she'll crab... highly recommended the lobster and shrimps. Also I left a $15 cash tip, which I wanted to give to our waitress polina..  But she said she couldn't accept. However if I mentioned it on here the company may give her the tip direct... Just wanted to thank her for her amazing service Waited 18 months since watching man v food to come here, and feel like squeezing in another trip before I head back to uk on Sunday"}
{"text":"I have been to this place a few times , I thought they had the best crawfish in Vegas...As my bf and I kept going we noticed that the crawfish is not fresh at all. 4 Out of the 7 times we've been there some of the crawfish were black, now you know when it's not good at all when you open the crawfish and find black juice not just one crawfish but a few. Don't get me wrong their flavors are all there! You have to try the hot and juicy seasoning which is a mixture of everything.   When they mean spicy they really mean it! The have other items on the menu for those who do not eat seafood like chicken wings and chicken nuggets.   Service is okay, a few times they forgot my order and never checked up on us to see why we haven't all received our food. Not only that they never even apologized. Make sure the printer in the back is working!  Oh yeah, Parking is a pain in the butt when it's busy!"}
{"text":"My friends and I always come here for some great tasting seafood! It never fails to satisfy our craving! We always get the hot n' juicy special for all of your seafood and its just so darn tasty I have to lick all my fingers!  They offer seafood sold at market price and by the pound: Shrimp Green mussels blk mussels clams snow crab king crab craw fish  and two other crab species that are seasonal.   Bibs and gloves are given to protect the digits and your clothing from splatter when you are eating.   We always try to go early. This place will always have some wait time so if you are in a large group plan ahead. We go to the one on Valley View and Spring mountain because it is the larger one on our side of town and the parking lot is a larger compared to the decatur location. Parking can be a hassle during peak business hours but there are lots behind the restaurant you can park at with a short walk.   Cajun fries are delicious and always served fresh and crunchy!   A MUST TRY!"}
{"text":"We went in to try this place and no one cares it is very clear."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! Everything is perfect. Food is awesome, staff and service is great. I prefer HnJ over BC. Only down part about it is the parking! A +++ for Hot N Juicy!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable host/server bad reputation to the restaurant i cant believe they judge people on how do they do seating.  its just because im wearing a shirt short and flipflops i have to wait 45mins and because this guy is wearing a suit he just walk in and got a table already nice! right oh well i understand server has to make there money!!!! and then the host/server ask us if we want to seat in the bar cause i think she noticed that we been waiting for a long time! and i decided to walk out.   that was a bad example of a host/server she will bring these place down , the food was good but with that judgement im not coming back to this place again and i will let all my family friends and co workers know about that incident ,  i hope it will reach through the management or owner and i hope they make things right , you might lose customer by that!!!!!! bad bad bad reputation!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"O-VER-RA-TED! Un-freakin-believable. Went last week for an early dinner to beat the crowd. Took forever to even place the order, but okay at least we're seated. The waitress comes over (Asian chic) asking what we wanna order, speaking so fast (like an auctioneer). Clearly she's in a hurry. we order our food and it comes out fairly quickly. Shrimp... then crab.... some fried catfish.... then a sudden halt. Where's the crawfish? Asked a waitress to check on it after waiting at least 15 minutes. She said \"they're working on it, it should be right out.\" 10 minutes later, still nothing. Ask another server - \"it's on the ticket so it should be on the way.\" ANOTHER 15 minutes and at this point we don't even want it anymore. I mean seriously, it took us less time to wait to order and eat everything, and still no crawfish. We ask if we can cancel the order since it's taken WAY too long. Great no problem... then the bill comes and they still charge for the crawfish! Ayuh! Wave one down again and they take it off - no apology... nothing.  As far as the taste - it's not all that. If ya'll are from So. Cal, don't waste your time here. Go to Boiling Crab in L.A.  Save your time and money for the craps table - at least you'll have a fighting chance. This was a lose/lose situation.  Hot n Juicy Crawfish? I wouldn't know... it never came!"}
{"text":"This place is ridiculous in the best way possible. Huge servings of shellfish dropped in a bag on your table, steaming with spices. Yes, please. Definitely order a side of rolls with your order to get the most out of that extra sauce. I got a pound of shrimp with sausage, a side of rolls and a sapporo and it was the best decision i've ever made. Can't wait to go back when I'm not with all of my vegetarian friends ; )"}
{"text":"I've been to the Hot N Juicy locations in vegas and loved the food and service, but sadly the Westgate location is a joke. Definitely hurting the brand. I've given this location a few tries, each time hoping they've improved, but enough is enough.   The service is horrible, even after they supposedly flew in all-star staff from other locations to train the staff after their horrible launch during the super bowl. They always have empty tables and a ton of staff wandering around like they dont know what to do, yet their service is so slow and unorganized.  Not sure if they franchised this location, regardless, they need to fire the franchisee or the manager. Food comes out luke warm at best, wrong order or at random times so everyone at the table feels awkward that only one person has food.   Seriously, who gives you your rice 20 min before your seafood??? So that when you actually eat the rice with the entree it's already cold and nasty.   Plus their revolving door of newbie servers suck as if they hire anyone. Their crappy servers just provide justification for their screw ups and defend their \"backed up\" kitchen. My wife ordered a pound of shrimp and what came out was definitely not a pound, instead only 9 pieces of luke warm shrimp. All the server did was say \"oh, the kitchen double checks the weight, that's one pound.\" What a complete idiot. We had to grab the assistant manager ourselves who fixed the situation fast. He's probably the only bright person working there. He's a skinny asian dude that has served us before. If you actually still want to try this location, you'll be lucky if you get him. The rest of the staff have no idea what customer service is.   My advice: go to a different Westgate restaurant or if you want similar food, go to Angry Crab instead. They know how to treat their customers."}
{"text":"What fun! and what a mess!!!  We got crawfish with the hot n juicy sauce and then the shrimp with the lemon garlic. At one point, I was peeling shrimp and and a little leg flung out of my slippery fingers and nearly landed in my eye! lots of laughs. And thank goodness we ordered medium cuz that was pretty spicy! yes i'm a wimp, but i couldn't eat the whole thing if we had gotten hot.  Our waiter was super nice and helpful when we couldn't decide what to get.  Another great thing: it didn't hurt too much when I took out my contacts later that night- only a slight stinging. I guess next time I should wear my glasses (to also protect from flying sea bugs!)  One problem: obviously your clothes stink for the rest of the night, but my purse still smells like hot n juicy 5 days later... oh well."}
{"text":"I've been craving a good crawfish place in Vegas for years!  My husband and I wanted to check this place out because we saw it on \"Man v Food.\"  Don't let the location fool you.  We were immediately greeted by a friendly hostess, though the place was obviously really busy.  For five of us we ordered 4 pounds of crawfish and 2 pounds of king crab legs.  Looking back, we should have ordered more pounds of crab because 4 pounds of crawfish is an insane amount.  Both the crab and crawfish were so fresh and perfectly cooked.  They were brought out in plastic bags soaking in sauce, which I understood was to help the food really absorb the flavor.  We ordered it all with garlic butter flavor at the \"spicy\" level.  When they say spicy, they mean spicy.  We all have a high tolerance for spicy foods, and the restaurant's level of spicy maxed out our taste buds.  I recommend ordering rice or rolls to help tone down the spicy.  On a sidenote, don't wear anything that you'd mind getting dirty.  It is highly likely that you'll get crawfish juice on yourself or someone will get you from across the table.  Also, come mentally prepared to eat with your hands & no plates--it's part of the fun!  We also tried the seasoned fries, which were wonderfully prepared: crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, perfect hot seasoning.  Halfway through our meal, the co-owner/wife of the chef came by our table to check on how we were doing.  She's kind and genuine--really wanting to know how our experience was so far.  Our waitress, Binh, was one of the most attentive servers I've ever met.  I cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"For the last 6 months ive been hitting up HOT n JUICY atleast 3 times a month. Im still not burned out from there food haha. Every time we hit it up we would alwayse order something different from the menu and each time we are never disapointed. The sauce here is soooooo yummy, that I sometime order the sauce to go so I could eat it with rice the next day. I love this location alot better than the first one cause its not as busy, you don't have to wait 40 mins to be seated:) I personally can not stand waiting more than 20 mins nomatter how good the food is. This location got my stamp of approval :)"}
{"text":"I've became a regular here. I just moved from Houston, and was thrilled to try out Hot N Juicy crawfish; needless to say I am sold on living here because Vegas knows their stuff. I tried the frozen crawfish but am not a big fan, but I do come in regularly to get my shrimp craving fix! I like the hot n juicy flavored shrimp! It's so good with white rice!! The flavor is unique I can't really describe it, but it's not as greasy as Boiling Crab's sauce."}
{"text":"I went tonight and ordered a pound of shrimp hot and juicy mild with sausage added and two pounds of mussels one was black garlic mild and the other green garlic mild with a side of rice and Cajun fries.Now, shrimp was good quality however not as big on the flavor of the sauce. Sausage pretty good and the mussels were nice and plump. The two stars stem from the service it was lacking. Servers when they were around were friendly, it's just they never came around to ask how we were doing or refill drinks. Now I may be a little bias because my first seafood in a bag experience was at the angry crab shack in Mesa and they had absolutely wonderful service and such badass flavor seasoning. I will say I won't be coming back not because the food isn't good, but because angry crab is better. And I don't mean to put down any business, it's just my personal preference and experience."}
{"text":"The wait wasn't too bad for a table of 6. We came close to closing but the servers were taking their time and we didn't feel rushed at all. They were also really friendly and it was just a great experience."}
{"text":"Saw this place on TV,  It's not bad if you haven't been to the best.  I personally like the dry rub type, this was more liquid cajun spices.  But very good and well worth a try. --RibChamp"}
{"text":"I think I may have shed a tear on the flight home! This place was unbelievably good. I had seen HNJ profiled on Man vs. Food. So when my friend and I were in Vegas last week, we just had to try it. I didn't realize that there were 2 locations. We asked the taxi driver to take us to the original location but he didn't.  I was a bit disappointed. As soon as we were seated, that disappointment disappeared.. The table is covered in a big piece of plastic, roll of paper towels, and menus. Makes for easy cleanup. Trust me on that...Catlin was our server and she was the sweetest, nicest person ever! I had never had Crawfish before, she explained the menu, the process, and how to eat them to us. They serve most of the seafood by the pound with the exception of the shrimp, you can get them in half pound. You pick the seasoning (Louisiana Style , Juicy Cajun , Garlic Butter, Lemon Pepper , Hot N Juicy Special(which is a combo of all of the seasonings)), then you order a spice level (I am a total spice whore, the hotter the better). They offered mild, medium, spicy and extra spicy. They serve it in a steaming bag that is opened on the table for you to enjoy. Catlin suggested that we go with the medium as it was hot and it builds as you eat. She said to try it and if we wanted it hotter we could order something else. We started out by ordering a pound of Crawfish cooked in the HNJ special seasoning with medium spice. OMG I cannot begin to tell you how good this was. The flavor makes my mouth water as I am typing this. The medium spice was perfect and was hotter than most mediums you have probably eaten. It was so good we ordered rolls to dip into the leftover sauce. And then the debauchery began.. Once we were about half way thru we decided to order the snow crab legs in the same flavor and spice level. Chunks of garlic on the crablegs....it was heaven. Oh no, I am not finished...we then ordered 10 fried shrimp. These shrimp were butterflied, cooked in a catfish type batter. We also ordered the Cajun fries (which we couldn't even finish) but all of it was the best seafood I think I have ever had. Needless to say our table was strewn with shells, bags and lots of paper towels (yes us girls got our chow on, somethin fierce!) the whole bill came to under 60 dollars (including beers with dinner). If you are in Las Vegas GO, RUN!! to Hot and Juicy. You will not regret it! Had we had a little more time we would have went again before our flight on Friday. Next time were driving so we can take a cooler to bring back to Phoenix with us. Basically you can reheat the bags in boiling water and they will be just as good as if you were sitting at the table in Vegas."}
{"text":"in a word...awesome!!  wasn't expecting this to be as good as it was.  exceeded all expectations.  highly recommended for those that love spicy, cajun-style seafood!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat! You have to work a bit for the food but that is half of the fun! It's a little pricy which sucks! But I love going here and taking people from out of town here to try something a little bit different."}
{"text":"This is the second location of Hot'n'Juicy I've been too (the other one being in Chinatown off Spring Mountain Rd) and it remains off-the-chain. This time we had a wonderful server who's name escapes me (Brooke?) but she was very helpful. My wife had never been before and opted for a pound of Crawfish. I went with the shrimp (more meat), we shared a dozen pieces of sausage tossed in the hot'n'juicy sauce in her bag, and we also had an order of the corn fritters (a MUST have with your meal). The biggest thing for me was the recommendation from our server to toss my shrimp in the lemon-pepper sauce. It. Was. Awesome.   My wife's only complaint was that the crawfish was a lot of work for little reward, but that's not the restaurant's fault. If you want more meat, get the shrimp. If you want to try new things, get the crawfish or lobster or any of the other delicious things they have. You can either have your fish tossed in a bag with the sauce of your choice, or order the sauce on the side. You also eat with your hands but they do have a washing station near the restrooms if you decide to go gloveless.   All in all another great experience at Hot'n'Juicy. DEFINITELY go here."}
{"text":"Just went back to vegas again a few weekends ago and of course just HAD to stop in here again, this place opens at 12 noon so we got there exactly when it opened and beat the rush because i kid you not by 12:05 it was already packed. I can't stress enough just how DELICIOUS the food is here, i saw a few of the same servers from my visit last year and they were all just as friendly as they were during my first experience, the food was just as good as it was the first time, and i'm just so excited to go back to vegas JUST FOR THIS RESTAURANT. LOVE THIS PLACE, it is heaven on earth. Great service, great food, clean environment, food is made fresh and fast, love it."}
{"text":"This place used to be good. The food quality has gone down big, no taste at all. We ordered crawfish and shrimp, both had a very bland taste and it was supposed to be the hot n juicy special medium. The staff that night acted like they didn't like their jobs. That visit may have been my last as the Boiling Crab is the other option.  Hot n Juicy needs to step up their game."}
{"text":"STAY away from the Dungeness crab.  They claim its fresh but they are actually recooking cooked crabs.  The meat was mushy upon opening so we complained and received another new crab. It was however the same mushy and spoiled crab.  Other than that everything else was fine."}
{"text":"was told wait for 20 mins for to go , but finally it took 50mins to be ready....tastes fine."}
{"text":"First time at this place. It took half hour to get order of calamari. Then they where cold ordered crab and catfish. Another 20 min wait. Then we saw our waitress leaving going down the steet never saw her again a lot of excusses about being busy this nite it was 5:40 when we arrived left at about 7  and not because we were having a good time  wont be back that's for sure"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in las vegas! The sauce they use is amazing, i usually get the shrimp and king crab legs, both are always on point! The shrimps are always a great size, and the crab is awesome! Also the Cajun fries are a nice side as well!"}
{"text":"Best crawfish in Vegas and possibly the whole of US! The hot and juicy sauce med spicy was amazing! Will definitely come back for more big and juicy shrimps! Wished u guys had more outlets in other states though"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place 6 stars!! This place was so amazing. The food was out of this world and the customer service was also great!   I ordered 2 lbs of the shimp hot n juicy style with medium heat - I finished it in about 2.2 seconds. I literally divoured it, it was so amazing.   If you're looking for some BOMB ASS seafood, I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I meant to write this review last week  but I just wanted to commend the outstanding service we received from Serena. She was awesome!"}
{"text":"Friends and myself were looking for some good reasonably priced seafood on our recent trip to Las Vegas. Someone recommended we try this place. We are so happy we did. The food was great, tasted wonderful and was really \"Hot and juicy\". We had shrimp, clams and lobster with a few sides. All superb. The best part about he experience was the staff. They were funny, bright and right on it whenever we needed anything. Parking was easy and there is plenty of seating. Definitely recommend this location when visiting Las Vegas. This will be a regular stop for us every time we are in town."}
{"text":"we ordered garlic butter flavor king crab legs and hot n juicy crawfish. They were spicy and delicious. If they could clean the crawfish better, just like cutting gills off, taking intestine out...that would be better"}
{"text":"Small place but packs a hit, get the shrimp, hot and spicy you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Ughhhh!!!! Ok so it waS a spicy tasty MESS! I made my own 15 layer napkin plate other wise I'd be eating off of a trash bag feel one time use table cloth! N as you can c in my pics the food comes out in these clear plastic bags plus theyre just tied up n labeled w post-it notes. Presentation was not appetizing. It felt awkward tryna grub without the normal plate setting... Damn, i was majorly Turned off thinking this restaurant's cheap n not only that, they did not have crawfish(majorly disappointing) Food was flavorful spicy good but nothing I'd get messy again for."}
{"text":"Staff is friendly and good is amazing. Bartender have a great personality she was amazing"}
{"text":"Food was delicious .... Michelle was an awesome server.... Very friendly and very informative... She gave us samples because it was our first time and it caused us to order way more than we planned to.... It was a great experience and I look forward to going back! Thank u Michelle for your awesome customer service"}
{"text":"First time here (Eastern Ave location). Probably last time!  I got a Lb of shrimp and a Lb of crawfish with the mild Hot&Juicy sauce, and some fries and corn fritters to go.  Everything BUT the seafood itself was great.  Love the tangy sauce, and the corn fritters were Really Good.  But both the crawfish and the shrimp were \"mealy\", almost \"powdery\" in their consistency... usually a sign that they have been frozen/thawed (and possibly multiple times).  We ate a couple of each and were disgusted. Threw the rest away.  Ate cheese and crackers for dinner...yum!   Save your $$$.  Go to Vons, buy $25 worth of decent shrimp, make your own sauce and be 1000% happier."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Hot N Juicy, but my friends have told me about it and I was really excited to try it out. I sat outside on the patio and our server Leila was super fast even though they were obviously very busy, and she was really knowledgeable and helpful with the menu! The girl who dropped our food off (cute little red head) was bubbly and very friendly! The food was even better than I expected (I would recommend the garlic butter seasoning). I also loved the fried shrimp with sweet potato fries. All around around great experience!"}
{"text":"I was there last week with my friends. Everything was great, good food, good taste, good service from our server Lemonade. We order like 6-7 menu I just love everything except the oysters just little small but aver all is ok. We will come back for sure."}
{"text":"So delicious! Everything that I've had here is amazing.  Favorites are the Alaskan crab legs, shrimp, potatoes, sausage and corn. The sweet potato fries are also delicious.  Seasoning can be spicy so I normally get mild or less than mild.  The lemon butter sauce is in my opinion the best for the crab and the hot n juicy special sauce is better for the shrimp and crawfish.   Keep in mind crawfish don't have a large amount of meat on them so these are best for an appetizer.   Service has always been good."}
{"text":"ottimo cibo, gamberi eccezionali, da lodare l originalità con cui vengono serviti! ! Quelli all aglio sono fenomenali, assolutamente da provare! !!"}
{"text":"Last Night I Went With Some Friends My First Time Going Their And It Was Good. The Service Was Great The Shrimps Were Awesome, Definitely Going Back."}
{"text":"I only come to Vegas for this place and this location.  I have not ever been to the other one but don't want to risk my Shrimp Basket being prepared different...  Love this place and our server was Fantastic...I can't remember her name, but she was a sweety...wrote huge Happy Birthday and Thank You on our bill and circled the gratuity that was charged to us.  We had NO PROBLEM!!! SHE WAS GREAT!!!"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place by accident. We had a soft shell crab po boy, catfish po boy, and a pound of shrimp. The garlic herb sauce on the shrimp was excellent! Po boys were also great. Service was fast and friendly. The only complaint we have is the ranch dressing was definitely out of a bottle and it was terrible."}
{"text":"My wife and I visited for the 1st time on Friday, July 21, 2017. The food was great! The service was even better! \"Our waitress was a young lady named (Valentina)\" She was very knowledgeable concerning the food and extremely polite, courteous and helpful.  We will definitely visit this restaurant again and if she is working, will ask for \"Valentina\" as our waitress again! From 2 \"Very\" satisfied customers!"}
{"text":"We come here every time we're in Vegas.  This was the first time I ordered the chicken wings, since I wasn't too hungry-It was really good!   The crab was cooked perfectly.  Oysters were good too.  There are 2 locations on Spring Mountain, this one is the we go to because it is a but bigger than the other."}
{"text":"Hot n Juicy Crawfish r always pack with customers during dinner hrs. I guess the reason probably cause the sauce they mixed in with the ingredients r just too addictive like crack. I try so many times at home to imitate the sauce they use without any success. Hope my constant patronage there will persuade some of the crew to give away the company secret recipe!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed....My wife and I went on a date night and was looking forward to trying this place.  We waited 25 minutes for a table which wasn't that bad of a wait....the wait came with the food....We ordered 2 lbs of crawfish and after an hour of watching others get their food we were told that the kitchen was behind and it would be 5 more minutes.  A table that sat just a few minutes before us were almost done with their meal.  Well, after another 10 minutes we still had no food and we went to manager and said we had to get food to go as we had to get home for the babysitter.  After 5 more minutes still had no food and it didn't really seem to bother anybody there, so we ended up with no food and and they end up with customers that will not return....  Next time I want crawfish, i will go to the lake, set a trap and catch my own as it will be faster than getting crawfish at Hot n Juicy!!!"}
{"text":"Finally (after the 6th mention of \"I'd really like to try Hot & Juicy\"), we made it there last night.  We ordered the catfish basket, king crab legs (juicy cajun- mild) and the pound of shrimp (hot & juicy- medium) and corn on the cob.   First off, if you don't want to do a little work for your food, don't come here. You have to crack the crabs, peel the shrimp, etc. Second, it is messy, but that is part of the fun. We wore the plastic bibs, we went through a roll of napkins and we still had sauce everywhere and we put all the shells right on the garbage bag wrapped table.    We both personally enjoyed the juicy cajun sauce on the crab just a little more then the hot & juicy we had on the shrimp. I think it would have been better for us to order mild, because the medium was still really spicy. We liked the catfish, but we took the breading off and dipped it in our cajun sauce. It was really good that way! The fries that came with the catfish were so-so, nothing to write home about. The king crab was a little over $20 for two legs. I would have liked a little more of that, it didn't seem like a whole pound to me but man was it good. I had to have my boyfriend crack it for me though cause king crab legs will stab you repeatedly in the hands if you suck at cracking them.   I have never eaten anything with the head still attached (well at least not that I can recall). I thought it would bother me, but when the shrimp came, I just tore that sucker apart and dug in. Well worth the work, I must say.  The corn was delicious as well. Yum. Overall, a great place and lots of fun. I would really recommend it!!"}
{"text":"If you haven't tried crawfish or have but didn't like it this place will be sure to change your mind.  This place is terrific.  It's a great spot to sit, chat and have a long dinner as eating crawfish is a process.  I can't wait to go back as I haven't been in a few months."}
{"text":"Spectacular.  The restaurant is beautiful, service was great aside from the one hour wait on Saturday night but the food made it well wort the wait.  Spectacular...  If you haven't tried this place you must stop what your doing and head over there right now!"}
{"text":"Reading reviews of this place honestly makes no sense .  been a server so I understand that service isn't always the best sometimes and that food timing is also blamed on the servers but common people . When they do a good job make sure you yelp about it not just when they have a off day !!!  Anyways about my experience here last night . It was pretty slow but no doubt it did have a decent amount of people in the restaurant . Our main server was Selena but it seems like they are all one big team because everyone was checking on everyone . That's GREAT . Selena though was really personable though and enjoyed talking to her  . Never had to ask for a refill because everyone was on it . And they also where doing penny beers if you voted for them which I did lol . Also great recommendations on the which sauces paired well with each of the seafood . Food came out hot and so tasty . The shrimp was definitely my favorite Will definitely be in again soon"}
{"text":"I've been waiting to try this place because my man loves Crawfish... and I love crab.. SO my brother came to town it was 6 adults and 2 kids. It was the busy part of the evening 6:30 but it makes no excuse for the horrible experience I had. 1.. when you have toddlers or babies at the table please offer lids so we don't have to spill the drinks over every where since the table covers move around a lot. 2..we ordered  2 orders of Crawfish 2 shrimp orders and 1 crab. GUESS WHO'S CRAB NEVER CAME... that's right the guy totally looked at us like we were lying and then asked after everyone was done can I bring you some out now... No you fing idiot my whole party is now done and I don't want everyone waiting on me. NEVER GO AGAIN!!!!! FYI if your servers are hurt with a bad shoulder I'm sure he's on pain killers and sucked as a waiter... I was a manager of a fast sit down food place and I would fire you in a sec if you were my employee......"}
{"text":"Damn good!!!  Just moved to town.  My coworkers recommended the place.  We will be back.  I ordered 2lbs of Crawfish, the wife ordered 2 pounds of Shrimp.  Next time we will order 1lb each of Shrimp, Crawfish, and a Crableg.  Hot N Juicy Seasoning of course!!"}
{"text":"Crawfish poor boy, garlic snow crab, spicy shrimp, spicy crawfish, sweet potato fries, and Michelle the waitress!!!!!  The food was so good we asked to speak to the chef to Thank him ourselves. I cannot get over the flavor burst! My tastebuds are still having a party!!! Great environment, great food, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I love crawfish, so we decided to yelp a crawfish place in Vegas. This place isn't too far from the strip when you take a cab, just make sure you get the cab's phone number so you can call them when you're done. I would not recommend walking here. When we first walked in, I kind of got a bad vibe from the guy who greeted us first. Actually it wasn't a greeting, he just said to where ever. It wasn't what he said, because they say that to everyone, but it was how he said it,. So I was like oh no, will I enjoy what we are about to eat. The waitress that took our order was friendly and smiled a lot, so I felt a little better. We ordered the Hot n' Spicy,extra spicy, which is basically all the sauces combined and the Garlic Butter, medium, for our crawfish. It was actually pretty tasty. The flavor was good and not overpowering. The group that ate the spicy didn't think it was spicy enough and the group that ate the medium thought that it was a little too spicy. Go figure. At first we thought they switched our order, but we ordered some more extra spicy and they still thought that it was not spicy enough. We order the Garlic butter medium crab and the crab was cooked well, not overcooked at all. We also ordered Cajun fires, which were ok. Nothing to brag about. I would for sure come back to this place when come back to Vegas."}
{"text":"Delicious and flavorful!  Copious amount of food for an awesome price.  My husband and I were visiting Las Vegas for a small weekend getaway, and we had this place on our list.  We finally made it, as it took a while to find it..but, BOY was it worth it! We ordered the fried catfish. It was fresh and made-to-order.  The french fries (my favorite addiction) were cajun flavored and fresh out of the grease!  We ordered the etoufee (not so great, just spicy) and the get your feet wet shrimp, crawfish, sausage, potatoes and corn boil.  It was delicious!  The sausage was spicy, and my husband couldn't stop eating them.  My favorite was the huge shrimp and the corn (flavorful and simple).  We would definitely come again.  They have other locations (some on the west and east coast), but they have yet to make it to the Midwest...i am hoping that this would change in the near future!  BUT, while we are out traveling, if we happened to see a Hot N Juicy sign, we are stopping and eating!"}
{"text":"Hit this place up for a quick bite after a day of snowboarding. 1lb Shrimp with Spicy Hot n Juicy sauce. Awesome!!!"}
{"text":"My little brother and I was excited to try Hot N Juicy today and it was also our first time here. We ordered 2 lbs of Louisiana style shrimp,1lb of lemon pepper clams, and 1lb of Louisiana style crawfish. Our 2lb Louisiana style shrimp came out first. I expected Louisiana style to be flavorful but instead it was flavorLESS. I asked for butter to dip my shrimp since its so flavorless and again, the butter tasted watered down. Absolutely NO FLAVOR in the butter either. The clams and crawfish came out and we set the other half of shrimp aside. The lemon pepper clams was most flavorful and delicious out of everything. As for the crawfish, no flavor as expected. Instead of the butter, we ended up dipping our shrimp and crawfish in the lemon pepper sauce since it was more tasty. The lemon pepper sauce is what gave them one star. Never coming back here again. Waste of money."}
{"text":"Be ready to get messy, juicy juice on your face, goodness under your finger nails, the list goes on.  In the end, it's worth it.  Just be sure you do not have paper cuts on your hands, you'll definitely get a sting, but it's so good that you ignore it and keep eating.  I read a handful of reviews and aside from the crawfish, many recommended the fried shrimp. Of course it was ordered and they were definitely right.  The cornmeal batter was not piled on the butterflied shrimp so that it's lost.  Another thing too is the batter stuck to the shrimp. It came out piping hot, enjoyed every bit of it.  Showtime.  I decided to go with 2 pounds of the crawfish, hot and juicy special sauce and I went with medium spice level.  I asked the server for spicy, but she highly recommended medium because it's rather spicy.  I was hesitant at first since, but fine, I went with it, what do I know. I chose or well, she did, correctly.  The hot and juicy special sauce was full of fresh garlic, delicious!  I ordered a side of rice, piled on the sauce into the rice bowl, highly recommended.  The crawfish was hit or miss.  I say this because some were larger than others, some where cooked right, some were so overcooked, the tail had zippy in it.  Regardless, it was still an experience and worth it.  Twist, suck, pull, chomp.  Service was good as busy as this place was.  Beers are cheap, can't complain.  Highly recommended to visit your local Hot N Juicy.  Expect your fingers to smell like sea when you leave, it's definitely worth it.  My paper cuts on my fingers healed the next day, thank you very much."}
{"text":"I recently moved to Vegas from Denver, CO and we don't have restaurant options like this there so I was of course excited to check it out (I've also seen the place on Man vs. Food).  I must say I was far from disappointed.  The service was great and they were on top of things.  I tend to consume a lot of liquids when i eat so it's nice to have prompt service and refills without having to ask.  Our waitress was super nice and knowledgeable about the menu and its options.  I love the variety of food and flavors.  We had the crawfish (hot n juicy style) and clams (garlic butter).  The flavors were amazing! But do be aware I was burping and tasting garlic for several hours later.  My only negative comment on the place would be their heat scale.  I got the clams less than mild and they were more like hot.  They did inform us that the heat scale was hotter than average and at times I do love something scorching.  But this time I was looking more for abundance of flavor instead of just hot.  Made it more difficult to discern flavors.  other than that we had a great experience and will come back again."}
{"text":"Pretty good seafood and is very comparable to the boiling crab in California.  I didn't like the hot n juicy sauce but the garlic and butter was rich, flavorful.  Will definitely come back because it is by far the best crawfish place in az."}
{"text":"Dare I say better than BC? Sorry, yep it is.  I wish we had Hot N Juicy back here in Cali but I guess it will remain a treat when we go to LV. We ordered the crawfish (I'm used to the red ones but they only have the brown ones here), shrimp (3 pounds cause it was THAT delicious), crab, sausage (skip this, trust me), and clams.  I like how they provide bibs and gloves. It's a bit akward using gloves but you will be thankful that you don't have that shrimpy smell on your fingers once you're done."}
{"text":"Always a highlight of my Vegas trips.  I stopped going to seafood buffets once I found this place.  Their sauce is hands down better than the Boiling Crab and they serve the biggest king crab legs I've come across."}
{"text":"Some friends recommended this place to us while in Vegas. I LOVE Crawfish, Crawdaddies, Mud Bugs or whatever you call them. The cab driver told us that there is always a wait but totally worth it. We waited for at least one hour in the hot Vegas heat and it WAS worth it. They felt bad for us waiting and sat us at the counter.   Everything is plastic because this place gets messy! We ordered the crawdaddies and they were served in a plastic bag. When we finished, we ordered another order!   After spending what seemed like hours in the place, we ended up getting the same cab driver back and he rolled down the windows. He wasn't surprised when we told him that he was right.   **this place is off the beaten path but totally worth it**"}
{"text":"The sauce is delicious!!! We went there twice twice in two days during our recent visit.  Highly recommend his place to those interested in some good eating."}
{"text":"I have been to Hot n Juicy a couple times now. Each time being a wonderful experience!  First time, got 1lb crawfish, 1lb shrimp and 1lb snow crab to share amongst my boyfriend and I. Ended up taking 1/2 the bag of shrimp home.   I love the seasoning! Its so tasty and spicy! Very thick and messy! I love that they provide a bib (very much needed!)  Surprisingly, I didn't care too much for crawfish. I feel like it was so much work just for a little piece of tail. The shrimp on the other hand, much more meatier and I guess I like the taste of the heads on shrimp than I did with the crawfish. The crab was da bomb as well!   Second time around, only ended up getting shrimp and snow crab again! We got the seasoning where you mix everything together! sooooo good!   You pay extra for corn, red potatoes and sausage. I usually add a couple corns and potatoes to the bag.  IF it is busy, you will have to wait awhile. You can occupy youself by looking at the wall of poloroid pictures. Trust me, even though its torture waiting to be seated and seeing all this delicious smelling food coming out, ITS WELL WORTH IT!"}
{"text":"Our favorite crawfish place. I've tried many other imitators but none can match to this one. The flavor is spot on every time and the crawfish is fresh (sometimes they only have frozen ones available)."}
{"text":"Jessica was the bomb server! ! She did a great job of explaining the menu items and gave great recommendations on the seasonings. She even helped us deshell the crawfish. We will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love a pound of spicy fish, a ridiculous bib, and some spicy Andouille  sausage. HnJ is always jumping and fairly packed with people so be prepared.   The shrimp aren't the pretty cooked ones you purchase from the grocery store so be prepared for eyeballs looking at you. I love this place and when they say spicy realize they mean it."}
{"text":"I've had hot n juicy from California and the difference with this location was that it was... flavorless! Very disappointing. And some of the shrimps were fresh on top, but the ones on the bottom were rotten! (Had a few black ones and mushy ones) Couldn't even find any garlic at the bottom.. which usually gives it that extra flavor!   I did enjoy the Cajun fries though. Very well flavored, perfectly crispy and fresh!! We took it to go and it was STILL GOOD cold.   Customer service was good. I would probably try the other hot n juicy location next time I'm in town though"}
{"text":"We always come here at least once a month and of course it's always packed! We don't mind waiting at all... and our server tonight, Jared-friendly, attentive, takes his time, and checked on us several times if we needed anything else. We love Hot N Juicy and they're the BEST!!"}
{"text":"This place is tons of fun!  Strap on a bib, don some gloves and dive into the crab legs.   Carol is the best - ask for her!"}
{"text":"I highly anticipated my trip to Hot N Juicy during my visit to Vegas last week.  Not even an hour after we checked into our hotel and set down our bags, we were already on our way to hot n juicy crawfish.  We arrived around 6pm on Saturday.  The wait was only a few minutes.  We ordered 1lb of crawfish and 2lbs of dungeness crab. I love traveling west to get my dungeness fix!  We ordered both in the mild hot n juicy sauce.  Our waitress, Robin, told us the mild level wasn't spicy and only had a little kick.  For my newbie taste buds, it was quite the slap! The crawfish soaked up a lot more flavor and spices.  I'm not complaining, but for anyone REALLY averse to spiciness, you're in for a surprise! The dungeness on the other hand was perfection. I was licking the shell and all - that's how amazing it was.   In terms of service, the wait staff is nice, but forgetful.  I get it, they're busy! They won't lie to you if they forget to put in an order.  We found it to be a little charming.  I don't mind being vocal about what I want, so it wasn't a real problem for me.  But I can see how some can be frustrated if an order is forgotten.  I still had a great experience!"}
{"text":"OMG...this place was soooo good.  The seasonings of the hot and juicy flavor is great.... the crab and shrimp cooked in this seasoning is sooooo DELICIOUS, corn and potatoes are so yummy.  If you order the shrimp you get soooo much for the price $10.   I love the idea of all the plastic bags, gloves, tableclothes....no utensils, no plates...its so fun!!!   Oh and the spicy is definitely spicy!!!   Its a couple miles off the strip but even being a tourist having to take a cab, its well worth the extra $10 cab ride."}
{"text":"Heard of this place on man vs food and coming from a Cajun family who often have crawfish boils at home we had to check it out.  Ok to start we tried the catfish basket with Cajun fries. It was \"okay\" the catfish was not spicy so we ordered a side of hot and juicy medium sauce to dip it in. Fries were also just okay nothing special just some fries sprinkled with creole seasoning.  Then we ordered 2 pounds of crawfish with corn, potatoes and sausage with medium hot and juicy sauce. The crawfish was great!!! Just spicy enough.. Perfect actually. The sauce is a mixture of all of their sauces and it has a ton of garlic in it!! I love garlic!!  The potatoes and sausage were yummy, not a fan of the corn. At home we throw in mushrooms and I think they should too because I was missing it..  Last but not least we ordered corn fritters. These deep fried wonderful tasty treats were my favorite of the meal and to think I wasn't going to order it!!! It came with ranch sauce to dip but you need to ask for a side of sorracho sauce (chili sauce) just a little dip of it and it's soooo good!!   We will definitely return, but I think I will try the one in Orange County."}
{"text":"The garlic  butter seasoning here is off the hook! The staffs are friendly and the location is prime. Highly Recommend the shrimps  over the crawfish because it's off season for crawfish so they are extremely  small."}
{"text":"I love seafood and this is a repeat visit for me. On previous visits the service at this restaurant has been less than acceptable--even when it wasn't busy. Today our visit was terrific. Great food AND service compliments of KJ and Jonzy. I will definately be back. It's messy but amazing shrimp and crawfish. Just wish the soft shell crab could be ordered as a side."}
{"text":"I love this place. It offers quite the experience and their sweet potato fries is always great with anything. Anything you order is awesome. It can be quite pricey depending on what you order, but it is money well spent."}
{"text":"Great attentive staff! Great food! We ordered shrimp & snow crab (crab was the best!)  Watch those cajun fries though they are VERY spicy :-) Had no problems with seating on a Saturday night, but the parking I can see as being an issue if you go earlier when other stores are open."}
{"text":"I am a regular at hot n juicy and let me tell you, i bring EVERY ONE i know here. The  crawfish, shrimp, and clams are  TO DIE FOR. Lemon pepper, and hot n juicy sauce are the top two flavors on my list. Sometimes the service is a lil slow but what do you expect when you have a 45 minute wait every night? Alexis is awesome. Anytime you come to eat, ask for her. She explains the menu to anyone that is new. And she not only has me and my party cracking up, but other tables are in love with her as well. This restaurant is a weekly event for me and my friends. I am dedicated to my Hot N Juicy Crawfish."}
{"text":"Service was really slow and it wasn't even that busy...We ordered our food and literally waited 30 minutes just waiting while evryone around us was getting their food anf eating...finally we asked for the manager and she wasnt nice at all and wouldn't even offer a discount...Never going here again."}
{"text":"This place is Absolutely amazing!!!! Service is great I just wish the had alcohol and more locations in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I always go to hot and juicy to get some fresh or even frozen crawfish. Today my boyfriend and I decided to go have lunch here. I ordered 1lb of crawfish as usual. My crawfish were overcooked, it was all smoochy in other words they were nasty.  My boyfriend ordered shrimp with the hot and juicy seasoning with the spice level being spicy. He also ordered extra sauce as usual. When his food was given to him his shrimp were not spicy at all . The extra sauce looked like grease with garlic bits at the bottom and it was just warm not even hot . We stirred it to see if it would turn out like the sauce that we usually get but it didn't. I went to the bar and I told the girl that was there that the sauce that they had gave me didn't look like sauce. She then said you have to stir it , I told her I had stirred it before but it didn't work. She took it to the back supposedly to ask why the sauce looked like that . She came back and said that the sauce was made out of butter and that's how it should look . Not Very Satisfied I went back to my table and told my boyfriend wat they had said . The girl that was helping us passed by our table and I asked her about the sauce I told her that that didn't look like  the sauce that we usually get and she said we must of ordered something different Before, I  said no then I asked if they had changed the recipes she said no , so I said this sauce looks different from the other times that I had came to eat here she then said \"they made it different today , they have changed the recipe\" REALLY?  she just had said they had NOT changed it  , but Whatever . today will be my last day eating here . Doesn't come close to the hot and juicy in Hollywood !"}
{"text":"I love crawfish, and seeing as how i go to Boiling Crab in southern CA all the time, I wanted to give this place a try.  Needless to say my whole family was very disappointed. The sauce was very bland, it was not as good as home.  There was nothing significant about the sauce. It was just essentially a bag of spicy water.  We ordered 4 pounds of crawfish and 2 pounds of shrimp, 12 sausages, 6 corns, and 2 cajun fries. What made me upset the most was the fact that they weighed in the corn with our shrimp (Note to Hot N Juicy Crawfish: When customers order 2 pounds of shrimp, they expect two pounds of SHRIMP, NOT .03 pounds of shrimp and the rest were corn and sausages. Those items are considered side orders, even if you do put them together in the same bag, YOU DON'T WEIGH THEM).  Highly disappointed in this place! I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"After seeing this on Man vs. Food I had to try this place out. I got the crawfish in the mild hot and juicy seasoning and shrimp in Cajun seasoning. If I could do it again I would just get the crawfish with the hot and juicy sauce. It was so good!!! Don't forget to suck the head and wear a bib."}
{"text":"A lot of options and great flavor!!! I got the shrimp and king crab with garlic butter and both were great"}
{"text":"WARNING!!!   The servers will try to steal your money!!! SERIOUSLY  I went here on 8/9 and only ordered 2lbs of shrimp and a bowl of rice. I tried to use my gift card which I had for $50 and I have the receipt to show I purchased it.  The server Dani advised me she had to go down to the other location because the gift card machine wasn't working.  She took my name and number and said she would call me back to give me my gift card with the remaining balance.  I called 8/11 was told I would get a call back,  called 8/13, same thing.  Then 8/14 I called asked to speak with a manager,  I was placed on hold for 15 min because Dani wasn't available.  A young lady by the name of Emily came on the line and told me there was nothing she could do, refused to give me the name of a manager and told me to stop harassing the store by calling to get my remaining balance.  I took the liberty of recording the call. She was extremely rude and hung up in my face.  I used to frequent HNJ weekly. Even when they were on DIRTY DINING!  I just want my money back and I can give my business to Boiling Crab or somewhere else other than here!!!!  BEWARE!!!!! #SHOCKEDCUSTOMER!!!!"}
{"text":"\"You should write, 'Valerie cracked my lobster!'\"  -- Valerie, Hot N Juicy Crawfish Staff Member  Done and done.  I brought a friend who was in town for CES here for dinner on 1/9/2013. We had one lobster and a pound of shrimp accompanied by rice, sausages, corn, and rolls. We made quick work of the shrimp but had trouble opening the lobster, which was where Valerie came in. She happily broke the lobster, displaying a steady hand laced with aggression.  The service at Hot N Juicy Crawfish was excellent. I like it when any server can help you out. One server took our order, another one brought out glasses of water, another one cracked our lobster, and another one brought out our beers. They're very accommodating and understanding of the messy premise of eating crustaceans swimming in bags of spicy sauce. I saw one server rolling up the sleeves of a customer at a neighboring table.  Excellent food and excellent service make Hot N Juicy a prime destination to satisfy your seafood cravings."}
{"text":"The food at Hot & Juicy is always good but when your service is great it makes it all that much better.  Thank you Judi for taking such good care of us on February 21, 2013.  Great food, great service!  Thank you - Terri, Frank, Sheryl & David."}
{"text":"Came on Monday at 12:00.  Ordered a pound of shrimp in hot n spicy sauce and 2 lbs of snow crab legs in the same sauce.And the sweetest, yummiest corn ever. So tasty and delicious. We were full all day and yes, you will stink of garlic for the next couple days, but it is totally worth it. The place was full with 2 waiters but they accomidated to all of our needs quickly and brought out the food fast. It was totally yummy. There are 2 locations on the same street, so if one is too busy, try the other one. Totally worth it."}
{"text":"had a TOOOOOTALLY fun time with the hubs a few nights ago.   Opted for the crawfish, since it's in the name.  While tasty (and ZOMG spicy for real) they were an awful lot of work so we ordered a lb. of shrimp too.  Head on, just how i like 'em - suck those juicy brains out!!!    They have oysters too, which I normally love but am a little nervous about in a place with bibs and food served in plastic bags so we passed.    Service was a tad surly and super um 'efficient' which I frankly quite enjoy (I'm from New York originally).  Bill after 4 beers and 3 lbs. of awesome seafood?  something in the realm of 40 bucks .    Absolutely sweat garlic for 24 hours and was totally worth it.   Will be back and keep poking around with other sauces and seafood combinations.    winner."}
{"text":"my rating is low bec. I compared \"Hot N Juicy\" with \"Boiling Crab\"  #1 the waitresses in boiling crab is hands down way cuter and friendlier. there was a server that we asked \"how long is the wait, we have been waiting 15min already\", he replied \"well good for you\" then left. I was ready to punch that idiot there and then....  i calmed down and we were seated in a booth  #2 the booth made my back hurt. It was sinking too much in the butt area and was not giving way in the legs area. if you were there to lounge and have some drinks, this would have been nice but you need to eat on the table and it was a task to lean forward for us to eat.  we ordered 2 lbs. of crawfish with the special sauce in mild level(mild level was for my  Girlfriend)....  #3 their mild level sauce is like a hot level sauce. I am not a big fan of spicy hot stuff but i could take some heat. I like wasabe, kimchi, the rooster sauce, tabasco i even eat a pickled jalopeno on its own with out trouble. but the mild sauce that this place offers made the surrounding of our lips look like it had wind burn. either the waitress or food server made a mistake or their mild level is way too hot to be mild.  so bottom line: WILL I GO BACK.....NO!, \"Boiling Crab\" is just a few minutes away"}
{"text":"Had a pound of crawfish and crab legs, my husband wanted to try it out for his birthday. Let me tell you..IT WAS HONESTLY THE WORSE SERVICE EVER!! When we first got there we were greeted right away and seated quickly but after that it was not a good experience.  1st off we ordered regular crawfish and not frozen but they brought frozen and it is put directly on bag what was ordered. We would have advised them of the mistake but once they were brought to us no one checked on us for about 20 minutes and then Ashley came to our table to let us know she would be taking over for the guy that was 1st waiting on us.  we also had some beers because they had penny specials since there was a Cards game going on but they never came to check on us or ask if we needed anything...I actually wanted to order something else but by the time someone came around I just wanted to leave already.  Right behind the booth we sat at was the POS system and although there was several people at that little station, know one would ask how it was or if we needed anything.  Definitely don't waste your time, it was our 1st time there and definitely out last!"}
{"text":"The place wasn't as busy but it took 20 minutes for the food to come out. The waitress went by our table five times without acknowledging our table. We literally had to wave her down each time and she did not apologize for the wait nor checked in with us.   There was another waiter who was servicing other tables who ended up helping us. Eric was very polite and friendly and made up for the lack of service. Kudos to him! They definitely need more waiters like him around."}
{"text":"Okay. So this is quite possibly one of the best places to eat in Vegas.  The food is about as filling as crawfish can be expected to be - but who cares? No one goes there for the filling. They go for the KICKASS flavor!  There are 5 or so levels of flavoring, ranging from basic to complex. There are about as many levels of heat.   I've eaten here many times and have NEVER been disappointed!"}
{"text":"I had a wonderful time eating here , my experience was wonderful , My server Enrique was Great  he was the Main one and he did a wonderful job ! Upon walking out I was informed by Michael that he's barley Training! For training he did awesome , if he did that good for training than I know he will be such a good server . Next time I go I'm asking for him to be my server."}
{"text":"OMGoodness!!!  I never thought I'd find a place better than Boiling Crab but here it is!!  First off we were seated immediately, no one hour wait!  Granted we went at about 9pm.  The service is what knocked off the last star.  The staff was very friendly but we had to track someone down everytime we needed anything... more food, water, etc.  The Shrimp is Amazing!!!  Nice BIG fresh shrimp smothered in a sauce that is RIDICULOUSLY DELICIOUS!!  We had the Hot and Juicy Medium.  I wish I had ordered more than one pound but couldn't fit it in my belly.  The Cajun Fries were okay.  BC has that one hand down.  Can't wait for my next Vegas visit to eat here again!!"}
{"text":"Service was average, had to ask for refills which took a long time. If you are looking for the experience and a \"snack\" by all means visit this restaurant. We ordered the \"get your feet wet\" for my husband and I with the \"hot and juicy\" seasoning, which was horrible ( big pieces of garlic) left the place hungrier than we came in. The pound of shrimp translated into about 6-7 large shrimp and  a few crawfish. The edible portion of the meal was only about 15% with most of it being the potato and corn. Wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Come here to release all the stress from work and enjoy their HOT N JUICY SHRIMP!!! Must go if your in town!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst seafood experience I have had in a long time, the wait staff did not know which table ordered the food. I watched my shrimp basket go to other table first. Luck they didn't try it, it was so hot it burned my mouth. The étouffée was pepper hot and void of taste. It seem liked they showed the crawfish the pot and they jumped out. The beer was the only redeeming value."}
{"text":"First time having crawfish, got the medium, perfect  hint of spice !! looove the sauce, and our main server was nice, a few other in our groups who are season spice eaters got the spicey sauce and it was to hot and burned their lips. Lols. anyways I enjoyed it, the sauce is thick n finger lickin good !!would go back. but the craw fish did seem very, very very small ......."}
{"text":"i was there 11/27/12 and it was my first time there....and definitely wont be the last either!  this place was hands down the best crawfish i ever had in my life.  i ordered a pound of crawfish, shrimp, 3 corn, 3 potato's and some rice.  the hot n juicy sauce and garlic butter was amazing!  this place is def a mandatory spot to eat at for me everytime i come to vegas... and thats at least 4 times a year!"}
{"text":"The by the pound seafood is always exceptional tasting! The service is always just okay. I haven't been hot juicy crawfish for approximately a year and one thing that surprised me is the price of the seafood has gone up considerably in the last year. Honestly I would give this restaurant five stars if it wasn't for the exceptionally high price increases the last year. During the same time I purchase similar seafood at the supermarket and prices have just not gone up that fast. What used to be a very reasonably priced restaurant a few years ago I would consider on the high side now. As an example the peel and eat shrimp is now $14.99 lb!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and service! Food was tasty especially the hot and juicy sauce.  Servers were very attentive and kept our drinks coming."}
{"text":"Delish! Just put on a bib, get your coronas and get your grub on. This is a must stop when in Vegas and tired of casino food.  Whole shebang medium will have your Latino friends (who have some practice with some spicy food) crying, hot only for the super pros."}
{"text":"Went here on a Thursday night. I was craving fried catfish. The place was packed, so I figured that's usually a good sign of good food. I can't say I was completely wrong, but I wasn't satisfied. See, down in the Bayou, we don't \"bread\" our catfish. It's more like a cornmeal batter.. This place's catfish was heavily breaded and wasn't what I expected after hearing so many good things about Hot N Juicy. Not enough flavor, but at least the Sapporo was good! I'm sure that the specialty here is the crawfish (which I'll have another time), but that's a different review. Service was great and the girls working were full of spunk, polite and respectful."}
{"text":"Must try for sure!  I didn't even know about this place til after I moved from LV!   It is definitely good food.  The wait staff was communicative with how small the crawfish were since it's 'off season' but it was still good!!"}
{"text":"Nice place but...Came in for the hot n juicy crawfish...have never been so disappointed! Ordered 1 lb. Big fat crawfish but with teeny tiny tails. Left hungry. Great taste but why should anyone have to spend $100 in crawfish to get your fill? Other items are probably good but my first experience was a big let gown. Order the crawfish as an appetizer."}
{"text":"Hot and juicy rocked again my girlfriend and I were served quickly and the crab and shrimp was off the chart good. Hostess aubree was quick and kind very cool."}
{"text":"Hey Yelpers, this place is awesome. So awesome I signed up for yelp just to give a damn review. My group had the Hot n Juicy spicy crawfish. Don't be scared of the spicy, not like you're drinking the juice. Also had the snow crabs and shrimp. All of it was delicious. A BIG thank you to our awesome server Brooke. Ask for her, she did a great job showing us how things worked here. Great. Valeria also stopped by the table to see how things were going. She gave us all the scoop on what to do in Vegas. Big ups to her. As a matter of fact, bigs ups to everyone here. Even me."}
{"text":"I tried this place over the weekend when my cousin noticed it on Man vs. Food.  I tried 2lbs of crawfish drenched in thier medium hot and juicy sauce which still had my nose dripping like crazy.  Wear the bib cuz it gets real messy so you will need to use alot of napkins for sure.  It was my first time trying crawfish which wasn't that bad, but they have other items on the menu as well like shrimp, king crab legs, blue crab, and lobster to name of few.  If you dare to try the hot hot sauce man I feel real bad for you.. I would definitley come back here again."}
{"text":"Waited to be seated 40 minutes on a Sunday night. Then another 55 minutes for my food. The restaurant closed before I got my food. Expensive, spicy (even the mild) condiments. Staff is friendly but have no clue as to when the food will be delivered to our table. Not going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Just delicious food in good price.  Cheerful waitress with good services.  My friends and I enjoy very much!"}
{"text":"Delicious and well priced!  Ordered shrimp, crawfish, king crab legs, corn, sweet potato fries and sausage. All was great. A few tips: 1- hot & juicy sauce is definitely spicy. Ordered mild and it's what most people would consider medium hot.   2- crab legs were delicious in the lemon pepper sauce. Not the best bang for your buck because of the shell weight. That said, most gratifying in terms of how much meat comes out of each leg. Worth a try for sure!  3- rolls. This was a last minute addition and one I'd highly suggest. Order some rolls (they came out nice and warm) to dip in the sauce- perfect way to round out the meal  4- gloves. They don't offer them unless you ask and its worth it. They have thin plastic disposable gloves which come in VERY handy especially with all the spicy sauces you're dipping into.  This place is worth going to again and again. Came in on a weekday around 8PM and the wait was approximately 20 minutes. Moved along quickly and most definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"We live in Henderson so we wre so excited when this location opened up. We tried it a few months ago when it first opened. The food (sauce) was not the same and neither was the service. We chalked it up to just opening.   Tried it again last night. Service is BAD. Several people did come to check on us. however after asking for my husband's rice THREE times we finally got it at almost the end of the meal. The sauce for some reason is absolutely not the same. We both ordered snow crab, one with garlic butter mild, one with hot-n-juicy mild. Very little sauce in the bag and the taste is just different. The crab was not as fresh it seemed either. We both became sick last night.   It was so different that when we left I called the location on Spring Mtn to see if it was the same owner. The girl on the phone was very nice and said yes. She advised me to place a YELP review and then someone would contact me. We will only be going to this location from now on, but I do hope they fix this one. If this is the first location someone tries I doubt they will be back!"}
{"text":"The service was very slow. I was there alone and waited 20 minutes to be seated. The restaurant was half empty. There was another 15 minute wait before anyone came to my table. I received my food about 20 minuets later and I received the wrong order. My bill also had drinks on it that I never ordered. On top all this the food was nothing to brag about. Don't think I'll be going there on my next trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"As always Hot N Juicy delivers. I have been here only multiple occasions and have always enjoyed the atmosphere of the restaurant. Of course the food is what stands out. Delicious fresh seafood in absolutely amazing sauces varying from mild to spicy for the more adventurous types.   While I usually go in a group we typically start with two pounds of food and add on as we go. I have had the shrimp extra spicy hot n juicy, lemon pepper. The snow crab legs hot n juicy extra spicy. The lobster (mind you it is served whole) hot n juicy extra spicy. A few sides such as sweet potato fries, the sausage and corn on the cob.   Yes it is a bit of work while eating to de-shell the food, but to me that's part of experience and I don't mind getting my hands dirty (also ask for gloves if you want). I highly recommend this place to seafood lovers or people who just want to have a fun time with dinner. 5/5  -Arnold."}
{"text":"Food was great and usually the service at any of their locations are wonderful but our server Lemon was less than pleasant. Very abrupt and rude making the eating experience uncomfortable. She kind of halfheartedly did her job by yelling if things are ok at same time walking away before an answer and we weren't able to get refills on our drinks while we ate spicy seasonings. Probably won't return to this location."}
{"text":"Service was terrible. We ordered pound each of shrimp, and crab two pound of crawfish and a pound and a half lobster and oysters. The food comes out at different times  based on cook time I assume. They forgot the free sides when you order two pound of crawfish. We had three waitresses and one waiter before we were finished, over two hours later. The food was good hot and juicy mild And medium.  After waiting over 45 minutes for shrimp that came out wrong I gave up."}
{"text":"The food was the bomb! I was really impressed. I chose this for my birthday b/c I was looking for some really good seafood and a good time! Obviously eating with your hands and getting messy is fun! I thought it was Kool to choose my seasoning and level of spice.. At 1st I wasn't impressed with my services but another server jumped right in and took care of us so I completely forgot about the other girl, it was a great birthday dinner"}
{"text":"Being from Louisiana, my crawfish expectations are high.  The reason why I give this review a 2.5 (rounded off) is simply because of their hot/spicy sauce that they sautéed the crawfish in. If not for the sauce, I would have given this a 1. The crawfish itself was over cooked to the point where it broke apart when you try to peel it, similar to eating dead crawfish. The tails of the crawfish was bland due to the fact that they boil the crawfish with little seasonings to none at all, then they sautéed it with their signature sauce. The sauce was very flavorful and I think that's what made it for me. The amount of crawfish oil they added was insane though! It was spicy, but the spiciness was due to the oil, not from the seasonings. Nonetheless, it was very unique and memorable."}
{"text":"The food was delicious, I can not complain about that... but please explain to me how can you guys deliver my shrimp and make me wait 15 minutes for a side of rice. And when I explained to the tall redhead that we were still waiting for half our order, she had to nerve to give the worst attitude and say \"we bring everything out fresh so you have to wait for the item to be ready\" WOW I have never been spoken to like that by a server. I will have to find a new place to get my Cajun shrimp fix."}
{"text":"Went to this location on New Years Eve, love!!!! The fried catfish basket is a blessing to my life, LOL. Cajun fries are equally as delicious. Repeat customer for sure."}
{"text":"Whats more fun than eating some hot n juicy crawfish?!  For those messy eaters this is your heaven.  Add some juicy crawfish into their Hot n Juicy seasoning in spicy level and Cajun medium level and BAM you have a party in your mouth, and hands, and mouth and all over.  Yum.  I'd come back here next time I'm in Vegas and maybe I'll try to the other seafood goodness..    Service is so-so but who cares if the food comes fast!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I come here often and usually  togo .     + fresh food, juicy and very good taste .( I had crawfish)  + fast togo.  +  friendly service.   - pretty hard to find parking on saturday and sunday.   ......worth your money and make you happy.:). ....."}
{"text":"SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD :D  tip: go early and bring gloves lol"}
{"text":"Very juicy, nice flavor! Reasonable price. I prefer the hot n juicy shrimp to crawfish with baby spice level. The sausage is delicious too. The snow leg crab and dungeness crab are both nice. I visited 2 times in 1 week."}
{"text":"not too crazy about the parking i guess you would need to be there early aside from that wife loved it good sauce and spice she liked the hot'n spicy flavor not too overwhelming just right she said better than broiling crab i myself is not a seafood connoisseur but i eat what my wife wants since it's her birthday i'll dab in the shrimp and sausage wasn't too bad she was right the hot'n spicy flavor wasn't too overwhelming just right. we ordered the get your feet wet and additional extra pound of shrimp and our party of 6 which is 3 girls, mother in law and wife finished it. bill came just under a hundred so not bad for a seafood of 6. i guess if my wife is on a seafood craze we'll come back"}
{"text":"I tried this place because I was in the area and saw it on Man vs Food.  I really wanted to taste their famous crawfish but the waitress said they're not in season and that the shrimp would be a good choice.  I went with the Hot n Juicy mild shrimp but it was too mild for my taste.  There was no kick in it.   The waitress wasn't much help even after telling her it was my first time there.  All I got a was a bag of shrimp, that's it.  I wasn't asked if I wanted any kind of sides or anything."}
{"text":"I order the crawfish w Louisiana seasoning wasn't anything like the way southern seasonings taste (being raised from there I know) it was spicy, other than the false impression of \"Cajun\" service was good."}
{"text":"Everything was good. Both the muscles and the service (our server was Stephanie) we're GREAT!   This place may be off the strip, but if you want some good sea food you should drive."}
{"text":"Walked in and told the hostess booth I was waiting on a party of 5. They said no problem. My party showed up and I told the hostess at the stand again. They said they'll have us seated in a couple minutes. 10 minutes later I told them again and it was clear that they were too busy or just didn't care, as they forgot the people standing in front of them(us) were waiting. We figured it happens - no big deal. Waited another 10. Still nothing. Left and went to another spot down the street."}
{"text":"The three times I've been here the customer service has been pretty bad. Servers kept forgetting orders, and they had bad attitudes as well."}
{"text":"I love this place! Best Crawfish and crab legs in town. Cajun style cooking is so delicious, we visit as often as we can."}
{"text":"This place is fun, the service is awesome and the food is good. Not that much pricey if you choose wisely the shrimps and crawfish. The sweet potato fries are addictive, the Cajun crawfish a must. I would never miss it when in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I did not get the point to this place. Overpriced and not so much bang for your buck. Very messy too. Next time I want crawfish I shall go to a seafood buffet instead. For the ridiculous amount of money I payed, I could of left full at a buffet!  First and last time I visit this place."}
{"text":"Love the food at this place ...Shrimp is just delicious !!!"}
{"text":"Good food! good price. Can be crowded which means yep the food is tasty."}
{"text":"This place is addicting!  The crawfish is amazing as is just about every other piece of seafood you can imagine!  The crawfish is obviously the star of the show, but the clams, mussels, and even the shrimp are just as good!  Be warned that this place is about as messy as it gets when it comes to dining, and you will make a mess regardless of how careful you are or even if you use gloves.  Everything is good about this place except for the insane wait times that you can get if you come during peak dinner hours.  Regardless of the wait time, just wait... It'll be worth your while."}
{"text":"Two of us shared one pound each of shrimp, crawfish, and king crab legs prepared \"hot N juicy style\" medium spice. Also two Heinekens, a bowl of white rice and a side of sweet potato fries.  If you order at least 2 lbs of one kind of shellfish you'll get a corn cob and potato included with your order. The total bill came out to about $60 -- not cheap.  The food was OK, not great.  I prefer my shelfish seasonings to have a bit of citrus tang to it, which was lacking here.  I believe lemon wedges are available if you ask for them, but otherwise your server won't offer them to you.  The restaurant decor seemed a bit out of sync for this style of eating which was very casual.  Very small parking lot out front -- we had to circle around the block a few times to find parking.  If there is a next time we'll park across the street at the Chinatown strip mall and walk over."}
{"text":"I kinda went into this place expecting to be dissapointed only because every crawfish place I come across I compare it to the boiling crab (a restraunt very similar to hotnjuicy) and im always let down...but this time I was strangely happy with the flavor...i ordered shrimp and they sell it to you by the pound...and 1lbs is plenty for one person! They serve it to you in a huge plastic bag and expect your hands to get dirty because there are no forks or spoons here!! The staff is very helpful and friendly! So overall I am a very happy camper :)"}
{"text":"Heard about this place on one of the TV Food shows so I gave it a try.    I ordered 2 pound of Crawfish in Mild and various flavors.  All tasted the same. Its just cooked in very basic Buffalo Wing sauce you can buy anywhere.  The 2 pounds of crawfish looks big but since I can only eat the meat in the tail, the edible part was tiny and would fit in the center of one palm of my hand.    Very disappointed.   Overpriced."}
{"text":"Ordered the crawfish Cajun and garlic as well as crab and shrimp and left there stuffed and satisfied. Busy place but we didn't have to wait long and the waiters were quick and offered us plenty of paper towels and whatever else we needed before having to ask. Food is delicious and fresh. Crawfish was amazing and I reeked of garlic the entire day. I will be back."}
{"text":"i love hot n juicy! i always get the shrimp medium w. the hot and juicy special flavor. its so good!! also, the snow crab hot (the shell is thicker so it doesnt soak in as much as the shrimp) also w. the hot and juicy special flavor.   there is no place that can compare to this.. so great! if you are ever in vegas you need to make a trip here if you like seafood and spice. sometime there is a long wait so be prepared for that."}
{"text":"Always a big fan of this place.  I've been at their location in DC as well.   Good food, good service, reasonable prices....  except the crabs...   to expensive for what you get, you are better off ordering an extra pound of shrimp or clams."}
{"text":"i love it here, its messy and fun...prices can be a little steep depending what you get, but its an experience you are paying for as well.  dont make it a 2-3x/week food spot like i am and its just as affordable as any other spot you go to once a while.  the shrimp for $10/bag i think is best bang for your buck, you get plenty of them and can get a few bags with different mixes of sauces and what not, order some bread its delicious to dip in.  the calamari sucks plain and simple, dont get it. go to the boiling crab for some real good calamari.  the dungeness crab is cool to watch someone eat, but im not touching it after ive seen the girls come to the table and break the thing in half and guts go everywhere, no thanks!  service is awesome and atmosphere is very fun, seafood is very good too! heart it here."}
{"text":"this place is by far the best seafood place.. food and customer services and the price is great! 1 lbs of season shrimp for $10, you cant beat that! This is a must go to place if you are in las vegas."}
{"text":"I love spicy boiled crawfish and came here while I'm in town visiting family. I'm a Boiling Crab (San Jose, CA) veteran and my favorite is the Ragin' Cajun sauce level Medium, which is salty and spicy -- no sugar.  I ordered two pounds of crawfish with the Juicy Cajun sauce at spice level Medium. The majority of the crawfish were cooked the right amount and it was easy to peel them. But the sauce was just too sugary for me, compared to what I'm accustomed to at BC or the traditional Zatarain's crab boil seasoning. I also ordered one pound of snow crab with Juicy Cajun Medium and the crab was cooked perfectly, just too sugary sauce for me to want to do a return visit.   The staff were friendly, fun, and helpful -- we really enjoyed our visit even though the sauce flavor wasn't what we were looking for. If you don't mind some sweetness in the sauce, I think you'll really like the boiled seafood here."}
{"text":"There was this nice woman named Molly, that made sure we had every thing we needed before we can even ask! Plus she had a smooth Pimp limp!! I think it's because she injured her leg!"}
{"text":"This place may be the Asian version of boiling crab, but in Vegas and not as crowded and loud as boiling crab. the crawfish were delicious and i looovve everything here. however you have to be a fan of wanting to eat like a three year old and use your hands for everything as well as the table being your plate. this restaurant is very casual and laid back. the staff and was really nice and enthusiastic but they were a little inattentive to my table, well i can't complain too much they did have a birthday table right behind us but still.   the food was good but not too filling. this plalce is worth to try."}
{"text":"It's definitely more about the experience than the food. You pick your fresh seafood, which includes: clams,mussels, crab-3 different kinds, shrimp and crawdads. Shrimp being the cheapest ($12.00/lb) and king crap being the most expensive ($27.00/lb). You have to get at least one pound and can mix whatever you want and add corn on the cob, red potatoes and sausage for an extra few dollars. You then pick the seasoning you want and the heat/spice. They steam it all together in a plastic bag and bring it to your table. I felt that the seafood was good quality (we tried everything except the mussels) but with the seasoning and spice it all ends up tasting the same. For that reason, I didn't enjoy the meal itself as much as I normally enjoy eating seafood. The experience was different and sort of fun because you are eating out of a bag with your hands and it's really messy. The service was alright and we did end up ordering a side of their corn fritters which were delish.  For good seafood at a high price I would rather have it at a traditional restaurant or even a buffet. It was a one time experience for me."}
{"text":"There are two of these on the same road, so I'm not sure which we went to. I'm not a huge crawfish fan, but my girlfriend is a fanatic. She ate three pounds of the little bugs! The service was fast and friendly, the place smells amazing, and the food was great. I recommend the Hot and Juicy special seasoning, it was all buttery and garlicky, two of the best things on the planet if you ask me. The girlfriend was a little sad that crawfish was out of season, but she said the frozen ones were almost as good as the fresh, and they were a lot cheaper too!"}
{"text":"I went here last night on a date. The food was good but the service was super slow. It took at least 2o minutes for just our drinks to come out. Then we ordered the drool and got no corn, and only 1 potato. We were supposed to have a 1/2 pound of snow crab with our order but that only equaled 1 snow crab claw with 2 and 1/2 legs on it. Any time we needed something, we had to ask 3 times for it before the server would remember to bring it out including the bill. It's not worth the money you will spend here. I'll continue to go to Angry Crab over this place."}
{"text":"I've eaten all over Las Vegas, and this is the best place. Worth the schlep off the strip. Shanna (rhymes with Donna) was awesome.   TIP: Ask for gloves."}
{"text":"I have eaten at HNJ in Los Angeles and in their various Virginia locations and this location was the worst. I literally got half the amount of mussels in the pound that I ordered. Based on my previous experience in any other locations and I eat and order the same thing at HNJ in LA every week. So beware.... I literally had to walk two storefronts down to Buffalo Wild Wings and order wings since I was still hungry when normally After I eat a couple pounds of mussels I am full and no I was not extremely hungry or drunk.....just saying! Avoid this location and go somewhere else on the strip."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! Great atmosphere. Cat was awesome, she helped us out a lot. Will definitely come back soon."}
{"text":"We couldn't wait to try this place. Airport to hotel to drop bags and caught a cab straight there. It started off great. We had crawfish, étouffée, corn and potatoes. We were planning to order more  and kept waiting for the server to return. She never came back.  Finally after 30 minutes we walked up to the counter and asked for our check.  I let the person at the counter know we were forgotten about, no response. Our server was at the counter texting and didn't even look up.... Disappointed to say the least. Great tasting food but the crawfish were very small and the service was terrible.  Tip of the day, carry out is the way to go here."}
{"text":"I love this place I'm so addicted to the catfish!! Wow it's really an addiction lol...nice place to eat."}
{"text":"If you want to grub out on a ton of delicious, juicy seafood this is your spot. The concept is simple: choose what type of seafood you want and how many pounds of it you want. You can also choose the type of spice you'd like. They have more than just cajun if you aren't looking for spicy (Lemon Pepper, etc). I had a pound of the shrimp, Cajun style. I got the medium spicy level because I wasn't sure, but it was nothing. I wish I got the most spicy. I also had the oysters on the half shell. The prices are reasonable and nothing beats well cooked seafood and lots of it!"}
{"text":"They open at noon, we came around 12:30 and it was already packed with only 2 tables open.  Our group of 4 was greeted and seated quickly, but getting us menus and our orders took a while.  We saw another group who was seated after us get their menus, orders in, and drinks before we even got our menus.  We finally waved someone down after 15 min of servers walking past us, and he didn't seem very enthusiastic to help us.  He first said \"So is it your first time here?\" and I say yes, he says with (ugh)\"it seems like its everyone's first time here today...\" and goes on about how to order and everything.  We've been to other similar seafood places like this back home so we are not totally new to this type of place, but it was our first time.. still, whatever.  The Hot n Juicy sauce here is awesome!  We ordered regular spicy, but I think we could handle extra spicy!  Its a nice garlic-buttery-spicy sauce.  My friend ordered the Garlic Butter sauce but it was not good at all.    The king crab legs are huge, and one order came with only 4 legs.  I was a little disappointed because the seafood places back home (very similar to this) serve more legs.  The food also took forever to get to us.  We got our orders really far apart from each other, and they seemed to forget our rice.  The servers were prompt with filling our drinks though."}
{"text":"Got here right when they opened. Had a pound of shrimp hot and juicy spicy style with fries it was delicious. Shrimp were big AF! Also had the crawfish which was previously frozen. I didn't like it.    **order the pound of shrimp for more bang for your buck!  Thanks yall remember to #eatlikethegods"}
{"text":"The hubby and I had a Monday off together and chose to visit this place among a list of others.  We arrived around 12:15 shortly after they opened and got a seat right away.  We both ordered the shrimp.  Mine medium and juicy cajun.  His Spicy and Louisiana style.  We loved them both!  The juicy Cajun was a lot better and more favorable.  Each bag of 1lb shrimp was $10 and included about 15-20 giant shrimp.  We added a few potatoes and corn and it was all worth it.  This place is what they say they are.  They serve hot and juicy seafood.  Enough said.  You will get messy eating here, so don't wear your Sunday best!  You can't find anything like this on the strip.  Hands down worth every penny and a great food experience.  We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"We never leave Vegas without hitting \"Hot N Juicy\" at least once.  We can't get enough of the huge shrimp, crawfish and the HNJ Special Sauce.  The place can get crowded, but definitely worth the wait.  Don't be afraid to get messy.  Order plenty of rolls to soak up the yummy sauce."}
{"text":"So good!  I had the crawfish with medium hot & juicy sauce.  And the fried brownies were amazing!  I can't believe I lived here 7 years and never ate here until yesterday."}
{"text":"I love this place. If you're craving seafood, this is the place to go. I love their shrimp and snow crab legs. I'm not a fan of the craw fish, its too much work to clean it up and the reward is not much. Their food is for everyone if you're a seafood lover whether you like it mild or extremely spicy. A  2 lb back of shrimp, a potato and a corn on cob full me up, that's for less than $10. The place is always crowded especially on weekends, because the food is good and affordable."}
{"text":"Tasty down south treat!  The sweet potato fries are \"the business\"! lol  For those in California, this spot is equivalent to \"Boiling Crab\" it's a must in Vegas too.  The only real downfalls I find with this spot are the average wait time of 30 mins and that you leave with your hands smelling fishy (but whats to expect after you have to peel your way through pounds of shrimp, crawfish, crab and the all!)  I'm craving this spot right now! Lol"}
{"text":"So I never leave reviews as you can tell by my account! BUT I felt this was important to write. The food was AMAZING! I will definitely go back for that fact alone. I give three stars because the service was that bad. 1)Our waitress had the nerve to snap at my nephew because he was playing with the menus 2) She repeatedly forgot things we ordered 3) The second reason might be because when we were giving her our order she wasn't paying attention to us. They had a shift change later on and the new waitress was ten times better we wished we would've had her from the beginning. I will return but, for damn sure won't sit at a table she is servicing."}
{"text":"Hot N' Juicy Crawfish is so delish! It's just regular sea food but when you add the sauces it just gives it the kick it needs. The only thing that sucks here is some of the waitresses suck. There were like 2 really nice ones that weren't my servers that helped me out and the one that was supposed to be mine was rude and hardly showed up to my table. So the service isn't the best but the food is amazing! It's a bit expensive but good to have occasionally! :)"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! The food was delicious and I thought the service was great.  Yes the servers rotate through but they are on top of everything.  They initially screwed up our order of crab but they felt so badly they discounted our bill.  I would go back in a heart beat.  I thought the crawfish and crab was delicious.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I've wanted to check this place out after watching the Las Vegas episode of Man vs. Food. Not to mention my cousin constantly raves abou this place, so that definitely sparked my interest even more. I didn't wait long because my cousin already had a table before I got there. Ordered a pound and a half of shrimp and a side of french fries. Mmmm good! The only weird thing is they provide clear plastic gloves to wear when you eat the food, I mean for obvious reasons of course! However the gloves are optional. I prefer to use my bare hands! Would I come back? That would be a definite yes!"}
{"text":"There is nothing fancy about this spot at all, but it doesn't need to be. The food speaks for itself. Definitely try the hot and juicy sauce, crawfish, king crab and mussels. The shrimp didn't have as much flavor as the others. So put on your bib and gloves and go to work!"}
{"text":"Very tasty food! King crab, shrimp, and crawfish were all great. Hot n Juicy on all. The shrimp was the plumpest with the most meat to $$, but King crab tasted amazing. I would get the shrimp a little hotter next time, they soaked up very little spice.  Cool music. Cheap beers. Loved getting messy with the bib and bags of deliciousness. Was a little busy, but worth the wait"}
{"text":"We got there and there was a few busy tables and a large party. It took a while for us to place our orders and then it took about 40 minutes to come out. Seriously??!! To order some catfish and fried shrimp?? There was a large party but it wasn't a party of 20-that I can understand. No follow up as far as beverage refills and when it did come around, we got water added to whatever we were drinking. Regardless of what it started out as. This place is cool if your food is To Go-otherwise? I'd frankly go elsewhere....... Will SO not be back-especially at those prices and level of service."}
{"text":"Overall the food is tasty but the crawfish are very very small. Recommend the shrimp if you want some actual substance. Had the oysters which were medium size and surprisingly good although the wait staff had no idea where they were from. This location saw the service as very slow and we waited about 25 minutes for appetizers and we were the first ones in when the doors opened. If you like a little spice the. The extra spicy is probably what you want as it's not that spicy at all. Improvements needed but it has potential. I'd take Flavors of Louisiana in Goodyear for more authentic Cajun."}
{"text":"This place is super duper succulent!!!  Their homemade Hot N Juicy sauce is the star of the menu. I love their shrimp/ crawfish dipped in the sauce. All the orders come per pound.  It is just mouth watering when you suck out the juice from your seafood. Great simple concept, decor is plain, table cloth, bib all made of plastic. You eat, you dirty up the place and they just need to throw out the entire set. Brilliant idea, no BS...  I also recommend ordering their soft shell crab and add an extra side of sauce to dip that in.  Be prepared for huge lines, especially on weekends.  And #1 tip: Don't wear a white shirt!  Overall, must eat place when you visit Las Vegas."}
{"text":"We love coming here when we crave for crab legs and shrimp. We take everyone that visit Vegas here and they all love it. I love the etoufe and gotta have my lemon pepper shrimp!"}
{"text":"I love the other two hot n juicy locations near china town but this location has the worst service I have ever experienced. We walked in and had to wait about 5 min and there was a couple in front of us and there were about 7 free booths. No one even greeted us. We got sat and waited about 10 min, no server to ask for our drink order yet. Many servers walked passed us and did not even acknowledge us. A man walked in and got seated immediately and was asked what he would like to drink. We still haven't gotten acknowledged by any server yet. So we decided to leave because that is just not acceptable. No one even paid attention or saw us leave. Ridiculous!!!!! I was really surprised how bad the service was because the other two locations are awesome. Sad because I won't be coming here again!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Really really delicious food! The hot n juicy seasoning is something you have to get, and if you don't like spice much, I would recommend getting baby spice as you still get a tiny bit of sting! The staff was really nice and helpful and all round a great experience."}
{"text":"We loved it. The crawfish were a bit of a hassle and you feel like a canibal ripping into your food but....it was tasty. I suggest the large shrimp and crab."}
{"text":"The green mussels with butter garlic (medium) were fabulous!  The etouffee was tasty,  although the ratio of rice was pretty high in my serving, and I really wanted more of the etouffee.  My brother raved about his soft-shell crab po' boy!"}
{"text":"Shrimp is the best deal, but crawfish tastes very good too.Too salty and spicy for me even I've ordered the baby spicy level, but that's because I usually don't eat any spicy food.   All seafood is super fresh.  Worth visiting."}
{"text":"Hang Over? The cure is some Hot and Juicy CrawFISH!   Delicious, Hot and Ready! The cute staff girls are awesome and often bring water for refills because they KNOW you would need water at a place called Hot and Juicy Crawfish! Amazing, must frequent hot spot off the strip when you are in town!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our meal here!  We had the clams, shrimp, fried catfish and a few other items.  Every thing from the boils is served in a plastic bag.  In my opinion, the spicier the better.  Don't wear white if you're coming to eat here.  You're gonna get messy."}
{"text":"To set the record straight, I am not a fan of crawfish.. they have a weird scent to them that I can't get over :S I've tried them once before (not from here) and I wasn't a fan. Maybe this place will change my opinion?   We arrived on a Thursday night and this place was packed! Apparently, there are two locations. I don't know if the service/food differs, but we decided to wait for a seat. Within 15 minutes, we were seated, which isn't too bad. We ordered three different flavors of crawfish - two pounds of cajun, one pound of hot n juicy, and one pound of the lemon and pepper. The first two flavors were not bad, the third we could've done without. The crawfish were juicy, fresh, and flavorful.. not bad, not bad! Each one pound order of crawfish comes with a side of corn on the cob, yum. If you order two pounds, you get corn on the cob and potatoes!   Aside from crawfish, we also had an order of garlic butter clams. They were ok, could've done without as well. The weird garlic that was used had a strong kick to it which reminded me of straight up horse radish.  All in all, the food was not bad for someone who isn't a fan of crawfish. Top it off with some blue moon, and you'll be set!   I do have to admit one thing, though... I felt like I was in a club when I was dining in there. They had some club trance music going on, which made me feel as if I had to peel the crawfish to the beat lol. It was interesting...."}
{"text":"Saw this restaurant on Man vs. Food so wanna give it a try. It's very similar as Boiling Crab. Too bad it's not crawfish season so we didn't order it but the clam and snow crab legs are sooooooo good....We ordered hot n juicy special souse combination with medium spicy. However, the cajun fries is a soso dish....Service...OK. It's a fun place to have barbarian craving fun."}
{"text":"Despite having had many bad experiences with our orders being forgotten and repetitively told it would be out \"in 15 minutes\" only to not get it after said time, I still continued to be a loyal customer because I enjoyed the flavors here. I can no longer continue to support this business after my last visit. I ordered food to-go (as I do often) and was given the total, which I thought was exceptionally high, but maybe it's always been that way...I wasn't sure. When I got there, I realized that the prices of every single menu item were increased by $1 or more, even the fries. They're not going by market price. This place is too expensive and not worth it anymore. They need to work on their customer service also."}
{"text":"First time coming here on a Sunday night. The wait for two people was about 30 minutes but I was ready to grub here so I didn't mind the wait. If you plan on coming with a large group make sure everyone is present or they will give your table away... Seems fair. Fast forward to the food I ordered a 1 pound of snow crab legs and my friend ordered 1 pound of shrimp and we both shared the Cajun fries.  The fries were great with a nice kick to it. We ordered or seafood with the hot n juicy sauce (all 3 flavors) it was awesome! Tried a few other places and this probably would be up there with the top 3, EXCEPT the service! It was awful.  I honestly don't even know who our waiter was. I asked for something to crack open the legs, I didn't receive it until I had two legs left and no energy to attempt the remaining ones. We had to repeat ourselves several times to multiple waiters just to get something. It was very frustrating. If the service were better I would probably go back but I may try a different location.   Just be aware great food, crap service."}
{"text":"Favorite go to crawfish place in Vegas! Got their crawfish & shrimp in their med hot n juicy seasoning with sausage, corn, & potatoes! And don't forget the Cajun fries!! Super yummy!"}
{"text":"Went here right after they opened for the day on a Saturday so the place was relatively empty. We must have been there for close to an hour and a half, and by the time we left the place had filled up. The service was top notch throughout our entire meal. Multiple servers asking if we needed anything, constantly offering assistance, and refilling our drinks. Our waitress was as friendly as they come and really helped us through the ordering process.   Now the food. We ordered all our seafood with the hot n juicy seasoning: 1 lb. crawfish (medium heat), 1 lb. shrimp (medium heat) and 1 lb. snow crab legs (spicy).  I could handle the medium level fine, but the spicy level got the nose running and the pores sweating. It added to the experience.   They will demonstrate how to properly eat a crawfish, and after an attempt or two, you will have it down no problem. Make sure to suck the juice out of the head, that is where the flavor really accumulates. What is great about this meal is the seafood comes out very fast and it's nice and hot, but it will take you a while to make your way through it all with all the peeling and cracking and talking about how great everything tastes.   The snow crab legs were amazing and we immediately ordered  pound of king crab legs when we had finished those off. The shrimp was tasty.  I even decided to bite off a few heads and they were nice a crunchy.   Although the place is named after the crawfish, and those do have an unique flavor, I would almost stick exclusively to the crabs next time. So tasty. Unfortunately due to the oil spill they were only offering the snow and king crab legs. Normally whole crabs from the gulf region are available too.  It's a great dining experience. Fun and very tasty. Your knuckles will burn with spices and smell of garlic  for a few hours after, but that will serve as a reminder of money well spent in Vegas."}
{"text":"Wow, what a flavorful sauce!  We got the mix over everything sauce in a mild (and a medium side of sauce to compare).  Everyone was right on the money in that mild isn't the normal mild.  For those that can't take heat at all, there is a level under mild with no spicyiness they informed us.  It was packed on the Sat evening so we got a pound of blue crab and pound of crawfish to go and boy did we ever stink up the hotel room.  The blue crabs were good and fresh and I think they don't always have them available.  Crawfish were good and it was nice sucking out the head sauce.  Definitely a place to go if you want to be casual and be a pig.  Next time we will wait and sit in the restaurant for the full experience."}
{"text":"Everyone's right!  The food is EXCCELLENT!  I actually told everyone at work about this \"hole in the wall\" and let me tell you - I am a very hard to please person so when I say something is good - I do mean it!  The only down side to this i guess is the wait time... got there 830PM was told that the wait time is 45 minutes but ended up waiting an hour or so.  My husband and I walked to the gas station to get a beer - placed it in a styro and drank it outside while waiting to enjoy our wait time ... I am sure if you are planning on going with friends you like - as long as you keep each other company, the wait time will not really matter (just make sure you are not SUPER hungry though).  After we ordered our food, it came quickly and we were ready to eat - be ready to eat barbaric style - we used our hands to eat here and it was so much fun!  what can I say - I am a cheap date and I hate formal dining anyway so this worked for me! Will kids love it? Well, if you are ready to peel the shells off the shrimps for them I'm sure they will eat a lot! Spicy is spicy - hubby got the hot n juicy spicy shrimp and he was sweating all right.... a pound of that for him n 2 bowls of rice, a pound of garlic n butter for me no spice and a rice n we were so full!  Try it - I am sure you will love it!"}
{"text":"AMAZING FOOD with EXCELLENT Customer Service... if you're sensitive to spices I do not recommend as we ordered the Garlic Butter flavor with mild spice and it had a kick. Best fried calamari I've ever had however the Snow Crab was a huge disappointment.  Drinks are overpriced but you're on The Strip so it's expected lol  Will be returning!!!"}
{"text":"i love hot and juicy.  everytime i visit for dinner i always get genuine quality service.  the food is amazing and the servers always remember a familiar face."}
{"text":"We got the Get Your Feet Wet combo with a side of 1lb of snow crab. Perfect amount of everything.  If you like a little kick at the end, get the Hot n' Spicy seasoning and mild. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Dear husband and I just got back from our oh, I dunno, sixth visit to this place?  We reek of garlic and our lips are burning but our bellies are very, very happy.  Sometimes we order takeout and drive roundtrip from Henderson to get it.  We had the cajun-style crawfish this time, two pounds each - as well as the catfish.  We wanted the etoufee, but they were out.  Hubby said the next time we discuss going to Hush Puppies for catfish, remind him to go to Hot n' Juicy instead.  I got the medium spiciness and hubby got the spicy and we were both wincing at the heat.  The Blue Moon beer helped with that.  I have to say that I prefer the shrimp to the crawfish - for the \"more meat\" argument that previous reviewers have noted.  I also like ordering sausage to add to the mix.  I have yet to try the dungeness or blue crab, I guess I never go during the right season.  I'd give this place a five if I hadn't had crawfish in Louisiana.  No place beats Dwights in Lafayette."}
{"text":"Go. Put on a shirt you don't like and go. Bags of steaming shellfish, buttered with a thick layer of garlic. You will be licking your fingers for hours"}
{"text":"get the king crab legs. their sauce is a crazy combination of cajun and jerk. super spicy and delicious."}
{"text":"Bigger than the Chinatown location. Every time we go, they tell us to pick an open table. They write your drink order on the cup so they can just walk by an refill it. My mom was not a fan of the shrimp having heads and faces. She would have preferred if they had just the meat in the bag."}
{"text":"Shrimp, more shrimp, and still more shrimp.  Bundle them up in a plastic bag with a boatload of spicy buttery cajun sauce and behold food nirvana!  Only can comment on the take-away part of the business, as I have never eaten in the restaurant itself, but the only difference is the seats, they serve you in a bag no matter what. The servers are attentive and friendly, even if you are just chilling and waiting to pick up your order.  Market price on the seafood, seems in line with everywhere else, ~$11.99 for shrimp, ~$9.99 for clams.   The best sauce is the 'Hot N Juicy' style, and they aren't kidding about the spicy level- so be warned!     Full on the weekends, and for good reason, you need more shrimp!!!!"}
{"text":"over rated crap wanted to go bad to this place after i saw man vs food.  Of course they see that it will go on TV and give Adam the biggest and juiciest crawfish but for us we get crappy tiny crawfish that were not even fresh.  Most likely they gave us frozen.  Ordered 2 lbs and probably got few ounces of meat only.  The weight of the head and left over skin came out to be 2 lbs. I know they got popular cuz of man vs food.  but they should come out on man vs crap  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE,  JUST HEAD TO WYNN AND HIT THE BUFFET"}
{"text":"Best authentic Cajun food west of New Orleans! Every visit is a real pleasure and Alexis does an amazing job to ensure that happens consistently! Thank you for taking such great care of me! My drinks are always full and my food is hot and delicious, but her bright, beautiful smile and her genuine joyful attitude is what keeps me coming back time and time again! Alexis is a real gem. I can't recommend her or this restaurant enough!"}
{"text":"Love!  Just discovered them this year.  I always get a lb. of shrimp, less than mild, because i'm a spice wuss.  Actually, too much spice makes me sick, so I avoid it.  But, even \"less than mild\" has a little kick to it and doesn't affect me so, perfect!  I usually order corn and sausage, with the shrimp, then a side of rice or sweet potato fries.  Every time I'm in Vegas I try to drop by.  I look forward to it every time now.  Great place.  Not a long wait at all, and the waitresses are super friendly."}
{"text":"Eat and have fun eating! This is THE place if you like it hot....and very juicy!"}
{"text":"Food is Ok, but if u live in CA, there is no need to come here, it's definitely not better if not worse. I give this place one star because they check ur Id if u use a credit card to pay, though i am not sure it's their store policy or a policy imposed by a specific waitress on a specific person like me. However, either is plainly cheap and well deserves one star."}
{"text":"Love this place, always amazing! I get the hot and juicy special shrimp spicy it's so good. The Cajun fries are good too. Can't go wrong here unless you you don't like sea food."}
{"text":"We've been to other locations so we knew the food would be excellent.  The thing that made this one even better was the service. Not that we had issues at other locations but this one is exceptional.  Joanne and Megan we wonderful! I don't think there was one server that didn't stop at each table to have a friendly conversation with each guest. The owner of this one hit the jackpot with employees."}
{"text":"We went here hoping to get some amazing seafood but the experience was terrible from start to finish. There was a 35 minute wait on a Monday night and only after we were seated and started to order did the waitress inform us that they didn't have over half the menu in stock. That meant no lobster or king crab at all. We ended up ordering some mussels and blue crab and asked for garlic butter and hot & juicy sauce on the side.  The sauces tasted identical to each other and neither was any good. The mussels were way overcooked and flavorless and the crab came pre-seasoned with a pepper mix that did not go well with the sauce at all. On top of that, they told us that they were \"running low\" on the crab crackers and couldn't give us one. I literally had to smash the crab open using the edge of the table. What's worse is that the bags they gave us clearly contained less food than advertised.   I asked the waitress if she could do anything to help us out with the bill. She flat out said no and didn't care that we had a terrible night here. I get the feeling that this place knows their primary customers are tourists that will never be repeat customers anyways, so why care about making anyone happy as long as people keeping coming?  Well, your restaurant was so bad I decided to post my first Yelp review in years just to make sure no one else has their dinner ruined. Luckily, one of your competitors was still open and we went there after our first round of seafood and had a much better experience."}
{"text":"If I lived in Vegas, I would be a fan. It just doesn't compare to boiling crab. I ordered crawfish, Cajun fries, and oysters. Crawfish was a little tiny. The hot n juicy special seasoning wasn't bad. It had potatoes at least. We added sausages to it. It tasted weird. Like turkey sausage or something. The Cajun fries and oysters were great!"}
{"text":"Can't believe people gave this place \"5 stars\". Food came out after 35 minutes of sitting down and it was crappy crawfish that tastes like a week old. The staff was rude with a \"I don't care because we have a line out there\" attitude. Don't go, waste of your time. We are never coming back."}
{"text":"Delicious! Worth the wait that's for sure! It's a little out of the way from The Strip but worth making your way there!   Went with a group of 16 so let's just say we pretty much had everything on the menu and tried all the seafood in every different type of sauce. Obviously hot and juicy is the way to go!   Crawfish is probably the reason why you're hear but trust me try the shrimps!!!! Mussels are great! Crawfish good! Snow and blue crabs were okay. Not the best and very salty! Oh and try their corn fritters!! It's soooo goood!  The best service of life! The girl who waited on us was juggling a large group like a pro! Friendly and attentive. We didn't have to ask for anything she was there to refill and refill! All with a smile!"}
{"text":"The food is good, the service is not. Not that the service was incompetent or anything, they simply don't have nearly enough staff on hand for the number of tables they cover. I probably won't return for that reason.  As for the food itself? It was certainly good, don't get me wrong. Not good enough to overcome the issues with the (lack of) service, however... Quite simply, there are too many places in town that have the food *and* the service to fret over this one..."}
{"text":"Went here with some friends cuz of love for seafood. I was surprise it was small for such a popular place. Food was awesome. I had had 2 lbs of crawfish and 2lbs of snow crabs. I was a bit disappointed because they ran out of Dungeness my original order... on a Tuesday! But overall good experience. The staff was wonderful. The food was great. Definitely recommend you drop by when in Vegas"}
{"text":"==================================================  Updated again:    They were actually closed, this time, due to health violations in 2010...info from the Las Vegas Review Journal \"Restaurant Report\": http://www.lvrj.com/taste/restaurant-report-105329198.html  Personally I could care less if a restaurant get's downgraded due to violations because they often are just a bunch of minor things but I am strict, personally, about seafood restaurants. I've eaten at B and C retaurants before...not often..but I have and it was no big deal. But yeah...actually being shut down? Nah. Not for me, because it's seafood. It's up to YOU to make that decision. Most of you may not care, but people like me would want to know if they're going to chow down on shrimp and crawdads.  You would be surprised how many seafood places get downgraded but I don't often read about closures. Anyways...if you want to still eat here I have an idea that may solve things. Watch the restaurant reports and go after the reinspections because they would have fixed all of the problems. I think that's the best one can do with these cases, if you want to eat there but you're still worried.  ==================================================  Original update:  I loved the food when I ate there but it's kinda ruined it for ME, because of an old news alert put on Channel 13 action news back in 2009. I just discovered this today as I was researching the art festival First Friday.  I was conflicted about  updating my rating, because it's such old news, but I knew I would have wanted to know anyways, if I were perusing Yelp, so that others could make an informed decision of their own.  I downgraded my rating to A-OK, which is 3 stars. It's not bad, it's not good. I'm more interested in being neutral about this place and letting you decide for yourself.  I had my bad experience in July. The owner addressed the problems in August, to my satisfaction. Then in November they got a C rating with the Health Department.  If you google the Vegas channel 13 news website for their segment called \"Dirty Dining\", you will find they had run an article on Hot N Juicy  Crawfish about many health district violations from about the time I wrote my reviews.    The News channel aquired the records of the health inspection which were archived as PUBLIC records. They publish them as a community service.   -----------  I think it's commendable he fixed the problems listed on the report. Just like he fixed the problems I experienced when I had a bad time there. I admit I'm a little freaked out these problems were there when I was eating there but oh well. I never got sick!  So the final verdict is this:  1) The food tasted great!  2) They've kept their A rating since the 1 time downgrade to C in Nov 2009 by the health department. That's GOOD! They're most likely safe to eat at and you'll have a wonderful time! It's never happened again, and I believe people and habits can change.  3) After reading their reviews, service still seems to be inconsistent, as the norm.  It's just my PERSONAL decision to not eat there any more because I can't get their past violations out of my head after reading the report, but that's just ME.  I'm on the lookout for a new place to try when I have cravings for messy seafood. Any suggestions?"}
{"text":"Ordered the crayfish, shrimp, sausage, and rice. The crayfish were small and I mean small, there were barely anything left on it to eat. The shrimp was good. The sauces weren't to over powering as well."}
{"text":"First timers..We really enjoyed our meal of calamari, fried catfish and snow crab legs mild seasoning of garlic butter. Food was served super hot. Come prepared to get messy if you order the crab, served in a plastic bag and comes with a nut cracker,  pick and paper towels. Towelettes served after. :)"}
{"text":"I'm from MOBILE, ALABAMA....nothing like spicing up the fresh crawfishes...I love Crawfish!!!! Cant wait for the season to start!  Pricing is kinda highin Vegas though....Downsouth you can get a pound already boiled and seasoned for $2.99...but it ok...its worth paying more when you are craving for 'em...=)"}
{"text":"Incredible. Sauce was legit, and for those who like spicy, WOW. Crab was overpriced vs. other local places and service was mediocre. But the food, yummy."}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW! Friendly service and even better food. This is my first time here and I love Cajun food. everything has exceeded my expectations. Plenty of food, everything by the pound. I will be going back again and I suggest you check it out when ever you're in the Tempe, AZ area."}
{"text":"Two years in a row, and the food was equally fantastic both times!  I recommend the crawfish or shrimp in their special mixed sauce.  Also, be careful, don't go any higher than the medium spice level or you will sweat to death.  This place is so good that it falls into one of my top three reasons to visit Vegas!"}
{"text":"My friends and I were so excited about eating here.  We were so disappointed with the service.  It took forever for someone to take our order and so hard to flag down someone when we needed to get a server.  We order half a dozen oysters.  When it was brought out, the oysters looked like someone ate off it and not fresh. We tried to get a server over to point out the problem and that took 15 minutes and she told us to hold on and sent over a manager that took another 10 minutes. We asked nicely if we could get a different batch and she said their all the same. So we politely asked to send the oysters back.  The manager said sorry can't do that. My friends and I said fine, we'll pay for it but we still like them to take the oysters away.  Later, I guess the manager realize we weren't happy and it could effect their tips so she walked over and said she will give us half off the oysters. Ridiculous!!! Such bad customer service.  When you go eat at restaurants and the food is not to your satisfaction you have the right to send it back right away and the managers should take the charge off your bill and ask if you would like to order something else. Not this place.  They were more concern with making money then the well being of their customers eating old oysters and could possibly get sick from it.  We will not return here again.  This place is just a mimic of Boiling Crab, the only difference is Boiling Crab has better flavoring and better service."}
{"text":"Who likes to go out and eat alone?? I do!! I go to eat out alone more than others because of my work schedule and manage to enjoy it because it's a treat to not have to cook, to have someone wait on you  making sure you're happy and last but not least you leave without having to clean any dishes. Well if you're expecting to leave here satisfied and happy think again!!!! By the time I was walking to my car I felt like I shouldn't try any new places for a few months, then I realized I wouldn't like anyone else to leave with a stomachache and headache like I did so I had to come online and review with details.   Exactly what happened: After I ordered I was left to be ignored like if I was paying with Monopoly money. Apparently  my \"waitress\" seems to have had a limited energy source and giving me good customer service would've drained her too much. So when I needed limes, more salt&pepper etc.. I had to ask the waitress closest to my table. If that wasn't bad enough my fried fish tasted like it was fried with old oil and the fries were tasteless because I was hungry I just tried to eat it and not complain. Then came the crab legs and although I specifically told the waitress I didn't want them to be spicy, she said I had to choose one strength of spicy and that baby spice was very light. Well light it was not, it was spicy, my lips were burning and my stomach felt punched with just one little piece of crab leg. If it had not been for another young lady that stepped up and asked what was wrong and how could she make it better I would've left feeling worse. They took the crab legs off the table and tab so I paid immediately. Left a cash tip to the girl that was nice and made sure to leave a handwritten note on the credit card auth to the other. Hopefully the manager sees it and provides better service training.   That's as much as my queasy stomach allows me to write. Good luck!!"}

I LOVE THE BIB AND THE FACT THAT YOU CAN MAKE A MESS WHEN U EAT...  GREAT STAFF GREAT PLACE!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The crawfish boil was amazing!!! The only bad part was the wait. But definitely delicious :)"}
{"text":"Awesome food we are from Texas and like it hot!! They completely satisfied our desire for crawfish"}
{"text":"Very nice and friendly service , very professional girls from front door to end I would definitely will go back there. P.S. The crawfish was little too small"}
{"text":"Smells yummy and serves a variety of seafood! The crawfish is best on this side of the country outside of the south. The service is friendly and I had an excellent time here!"}
{"text":"Great food, fair prices and great customer service, this place is perfect. It's also right next to Twin Peaks which has the coldest beer in town and an abundance of tv's to watch whatever sporting event you want to see."}
{"text":"La marinade des Crawfish est délicieuse ! Très vite servie, j'ai savouré et apprécié mon repas."}
{"text":"Let me tell you... This is my favorite ALL TIME restaurant EVER. I meant to write this weeks ago but I just got home and had time to sit down and relax... It was so nice to have a Hot N Juicy so close to our hotel, my boyfriend and I were in Vegas for about 10 days and went here half the time for our dinners! (And other locations) Our servers, Micha and Miranda, were so attentive to our needs and made sure everything was perfect. The food is hot, delicious, and juicy! And the manager Dan was so pleasant and answered all of our questions the best he could... My boyfriend and I even have places in mind that NEED a Hot N Juicy, and would love to be apart of the franchise. If only they were everywhere!!! Their sauces are phenomenal and can't be replicated... I've never had anything like it anywhere else... It is to DIE FOR. And even if you aren't the biggest fan of hot foods, there is always baby spice! Hands down the best seafood place in the world, and I'm from Alaska (where there's fresh seafood galore.) Love this place!  EDIT: I never do yelp reviews, but this place is SO good I just had to tell everyone about it."}
{"text":"Great service and great food. Very friendly even after the volume of people they deal with on a daily basis. Pro's"}
{"text":"I have been here 4 times always get the shrimp lemon pepper w/ Cajun fries which comes out great! Service is a hit and miss so don't be surprise on a busy night things are missing. Can't beat the Vegas location"}
{"text":"We've been at this place at least 7-8 times and it never disappoints.  The shrimp is so good, especially the hot n juicy seasoning.  My husband loves the crawfish, the dungeness crabs, even the oysters.  Their beer selection is small but enough.  I've brought friends here from out of town and they all wish there were a place like this in their home town.  The wait is long, and there's no parking.  You have to go early like 5 pm for dinner to avoid wait lines."}
{"text":"After all the reviews, decided why not give it a try?  WOW, packed on a sunday nite with a 20 minute wait.  Know all about eating the spicy mudbugs after living in houston 7 yrs.  The crawfish were really good, not soggy and mildly spiced for my tastes choosing the hot n juicy spice.  They were out of stone & blue crab, leaving only king legs and snow crab to choose from.  I got the tiny sized snow crabs, my friend got the shrimp platter.  both were mostly fries.  this place would die a quick death in south texas or the bayou country.  pros: food came out really fast, miller lite by the bottle served really cold. cons: limited items available that night, say they serve beer & wine but wine was only sold by the bottle last night.  atmosphere gets a zero, we were packed in like sardines, forgive the pun. waitress seemed frazzled, maybe it was her first night.  had to ask for lemons, WTF?"}
{"text":"Went here with my cousins and aunt since I was only visiting for a day.  It was pretty busy for 3pm on a Tuesday afternoon.  We got seated right away, but waited a good 10 minutes before our server even acknowledged us - at least we were ready to order.  We ordered 1/2 dozen oysters, sweet potato fries, 2 lbs of snow crab legs, 2 lbs of shrimp, 1 lb of crawfish, and bowl of rice for everyone.  The fries came out along with the oysters....but no water.  It was hard to flag someone down because we were sitting in the back of the restaurant and the servers were constantly going to the front.  We were practically done with our appetizers when the shrimp comes out.  OK, no water and no rice(hey, we're Filipino and we need our rice!)  Finally they bring us water along with everything else and we start munching down.  During the course of our meal we run out of water and we see our waitress asking the tables next to us if they wanted refills on their waters.  She had enough water to fill their cups and we thought \"great, she's gonna go refill her pitcher and come back to our table.\"  NOT!!  We constantly had to get up and ask them for stuff....not cool at all!!!  I don't care how busy you are - if you are a really good server you know how to take care of ALL your tables!!  The last time my cousin had to stand at the counter to ask for refills on our water another waitress came by to apologize for ignoring us.  At least they know they were ignoring us, but how convenient to apologize AT THE END when we have to pay.  Great food but lousy service!"}
{"text":"Hot N Juicy !  This place is really nice, with great employees.  Their crawfish is definitely spicier than Boiling Crab.    Their crawfish is DELICIOUS.  You can't get enough of their cajun fries.    Its a little more expensive than other places, considering its $10.99 for a pound of crawfish, but so worth it.    This place is absolutely how the guy on the travel channel described it !  YUMYUMYUM.   GOOD PLACE TO GO FOR CRAWFISH LOVERS to stop while in VEGAS (;"}
{"text":"Recommended by my father from a previous trip to Vegas. I thought it was a good fit for my boyfriend who was having a major seafood craving; he's also a seafood fanatic. He mentioned our meal of lobster, king crab legs and crawfish satisfied his seafood cravings and it was the best seafood he's had. We had our seafood seasoned with Hot and Juicy, Juicy Cajun and Louisiana Style, all spicy. Louisiana and Hot and Spicy were our favorites. Service was fast and food was delicious. Highly satisfied"}
{"text":"I'm not usually a fan of seafood places (boiling crab, hot and juicy type places) because I ended up getting sick at one of them, but I really love the way this place prepares the food/seafood and I haven't gotten sick yet! Plus, Jared was very attentive and nice!"}
{"text":"This place has gotten so popular as of late, that when I went on a Wednesday night there was a 45 min wait for my table! Great food -- the shrimp was the best, and the crawfish were great too (if you're a fan of crawfish that is -- they're so much work to peel and open!!) The food was definitely messy, but that's part of the whole experience of coming here. It's definitely something fun and different. My only gripe is that the butter and garlic sauce on the seafood gets all over your hands and the smell of it is IMPOSSIBLE to get off! It took almost a day for the smell to disappear!"}
{"text":"This place is so good!  The seasoning, garlic, and butter with the crab legs and shrimp is mouth watering delicious.  Just be prepared to feel the butter  running through your veins and the garlic emitting from your pores for a couple of days. Service was good and the food came out quickly."}
{"text":"Was okay. Didn't taste that fresh. Very nice staff and service. The Crawfish was so small and not even worth trying to eat because it was so skinny and dried up. I however liked their sweet potato fries. My brother and boyfriend got really sick eating their mussels and shrimp. They stayed in our hotel room the whole night and was having food poison symptoms. 3 days later they are still feeling the wrath and haven't fully recovered. I feel guilty rating this place so low but if your family members can barely walk due to overwiping and nausea, you would feel inclined to do so too."}
{"text":"Whenever we're in Vegas, Hot & Juicy Crawfish is always on our to do list.  In fact, yesterday when I flew in to Vegas, it was my first stop after getting my rental car.  Besides, what's not to love about food served in a plastic bag with rolls of paper towels on the table right?  My friend ordered a pound of Garlic Butter shrimp, a pound of Garlic Butter crawfish, an I ordered my usual Hot & Juicy special shrimp, medium.  That would be the only thing I would warn you about is the spice level.  I like spicy food and even the medium makes me think twice sometimes.  The flavor is a perfect balance of heat, spices, garlic, butter and just awesomeness.  I hope to go one more time before I leave."}
{"text":"We came to Vegas for some fun! It was Saturday afternoon - so we were hungry. We had 2 pounds of crawfish, 2 of shrimps and 1 pounds of mussel. There was something different with the sauce.   Crawfish seems like overcooked - really rubby taste! U I guess that kind of spoil the taste a bit. Shrimp could not go wrong. Mussel was good. Or maybe we got the end of the pot - sauces. I don't know. 65 bucks unsatisfied!"}
{"text":"Great place for juicy seafood. .. came for a friend's birthday.   Great service, good quality seafood, very spicy even the medium is a challenge.   Recommended place to come by all 6 of us"}
{"text":"I love this place and crave it ALL the time!!! Shrimp in the Hot N Juicy special sauce mild is my all time favorite with a dozen of cajun sausage, but everything else on the menu is very good. Get there early if you are interested in Crab or Lobster because they sell out quickly. One of my favorite restaurants in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Be warned, you must love garlic and spicy food, otherwise, why bother coming here.  I'm a bigger fan of the peel and eat shrimp than I am of the crawfish, but both are really good.  I'm a huge fan of the house sauce, which is pretty much a mix of all the other sauces.  There can be quite a wait at dinner time, so plan accordingly.  They also have a really good sausage side/appetizer, and their soft-shell crab when they have it is mighty good too.  I've been here several times and always leave full, happy, and reeking of garlic."}
{"text":"Came in town & found this place in Chinatown. Love the seafood there! Messy but worth it! & decent price also.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"i have actually experienced better, like crawdaddy in san jose. I was definitely disappointed because their crawdad did not have a lot of juice in it, plus i had to ask them to give me the lime and salt/pepper. There spicy wasnt really that spicy. it was okay i guess but crawdaddy, theirs was juicy and really spicy, this place theirs was dry and the sausages was very small, and i got kind of ticked cuz im a sausage person. its okay for vegas, i guess."}
{"text":"By far the best place I have had seafood in Vegas. Hard to find good seafood in the middle of a desert."}
{"text":"Absolute goodness. My husband and I got shrimp with the hot n juicy seasoning and garlic butter. Both were delicious. Staff was ok but we just wanted to eat a big meal in the middle of the afternoon.  We will come back again for the juicy seasonings!"}
{"text":"We went in for dinner! It was our first time and the food was delicious! We ordered shrimp, crawfish, king crab, sausage with corn and potatoes. We got the hot and juicy mild and it was hot!! Make sure to have water lol but it was yummy! I took a star off because of  the waiter. He took so long for just water  and basically forgot about our table. Overall I will highly recommend for the food!!"}
{"text":"Took a friend from Maine who was blown away by H&J. I had 1lb snow crab in lemon pepper and 1lb shrimp in H&J sauce. Friendly staff and casual atmosphere. Perfect place to smash some crab legs."}
{"text":"I've been to Hot N Juicy in LA and the 2 in Vegas and I've had an alrite experience at all of them. I had a bad experience at this location and was by far the worst. My friend and I came in around 7:30 and this was the first time there was absolutely no line or queue for a table. In fact there were only 2 other tables at the time.   The place was cold so it was obvious they were cheap on turning up the heat to a reasonable temperature. My friend and I ordered 1 pound of shrimp each, that's it. Considering that were only 2 other tables, I wasn't expecting to wait over 10 minutes but we did. Surprisingly, the shrimp came out cold for some reason and the amount of sauce was lacking that 1/4 of the shrimp wasn't even touched by the sauce. This tells me this restaurant is cheap and cutting back on the amount of butter they use. I wouldn't be surprised if this shrimp was sitting around and wasn't cooked to order.   Cheap on heating, cheap on butter and cheap on fresh shrimp. Will never come to this location ever again!!!!  Now I knew why there was no line and the place was really empty."}
{"text":"It's too busy!!!  That's their downfall.  They need a bigger location.  Togo is always an option!!"}
{"text":"THE WORST SEAFOOD!!! AND HERE'S WHY....  1. We ordered King Crab and shrimp  with MILD Cajun seasoning. 2. Second visit first visit same spice and  seafood choices approximately 7 months   ago. The meal first time was OK. Better than a Red Lobster, less than a non chain seafood place. 3.  This time the shrimp was ALL Grey mush.  When shrimp is mushy it is usually because it is water/frozen and overcooked. 4. The King crab was mushy as well.  5. We ordered corn and it was disgusting. 6. The sausage was rubber and not chewable.  Called the restaurant and we were going to return it,  but we gave it to our neighbors cat to eat... Guess what the cat spit it OUT!!!   Now I know what you're thinking it was spicy that's why the cat wouldn't eat it right??? NOT EVEN!!! This cat eats jalapenos. It was so terrible a cat won't eat it!!!! So you know something's wrong with the food. So we spent $88.00 for seafood that is worse than Catfood. Stay away this holiday and after."}
{"text":"Crawfish is good. Mainly because they are larger here than most other places ive seen. This place, the little guys were big enuf that you could pull the meat out with minimal effort. Ive been to places where you sit there peeling back the shell and when you're done, the meat is almost gone because it got squished between your fingers and gets lost in a boatload of shells.  The seasoning is good, although a bit oily from the butter. The spices left me out of commission the next morning but  was worth it at the time.  We also ordered the King Crab which tasted OK but it definietly wasnt fresh. You can tell it was frozen stored because the shell was soft and stale when it came to our table.  When you peeled the shell off, a lot of water came gushing out.  For $20 something a pound, we expected fresh.    All in all, it was a fun experience we thank Adam Richman for telling us about.  BTW, they need to move that dumpster full of rotting crawfish leftovers away from the part of the building thats visible. The sweltering vegas desert heat doesnt help much either. The smell after leaving the restaurant was mortifying."}
{"text":"My favorite seafood restaurant! The hot and juicy sauce is addicting!!!!"}
{"text":"I love love loved the garlic butter crab legs!!!!!! The oyster shooters were to die for. Our server, Angela, was such a sweetheart. She was consistent in making sure that we were enjoying our first time at hot n juicy. Great restaurant experience overall. We'll be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"If you are in the mood for some seafood on the west side of town, this is a great place to go. The food is really good and tasty. The wait staff was really friendly and quick to fill your needs.   The only downside is all the plastic they use on the table. I am not the most environmental person, but damn it's a lot of plastic.   Over all food is great, will come back for more."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying this place popped my crawfish cherry.  I had never experienced crawfish before, but had heard great things so went with a group of people.  This place was featured on Man V. Food and that has probably contributed to its popularity and thus is packed pretty much all the time, combined with limited seating and almost no parking makes for a rough start to the meal.  However, the seafood is great... fittingly named, everything was hot n juicy.  King crab legs were my favorite, they were huge and deliciously seasoned in their own cajun spices.  The crawfish were an interesting experience.  They were tasty, but i'm one of those people who doesn't like to work for his food that hard.  Whole shrimp were also great, everything, like the crab, came cooked with their cajun spices.  Had some fries on the side and couple of beers, and a messy bib and many napkins later it proved to be a pretty good meal.  All in all a great experience, but unless you're a huge cajun seafood fan there's not a lot of replay value here.  If you're in town and want a fun and interesting meal, check it out."}
{"text":"I went here to grab dinner one evening. My friend and I were seated quickly. The service, however, was slow after that. We had to track down a few waiters to ask for drinks and then order food. It didn't seem like a busy night. The food was alright, nothing that spectacular. I am glad I tried it once. If someone wanted to eat here again, I would. I am not sure I would go here from craving crawfish."}
{"text":"Went here for my first time about 3 weeks ago w/ a friend.  Ordered 1-lb shrimp and 2-lbs crawfish, both w/ hot n juicy seasoning spice level medium.  I totally thought I'd be able to hang w/ the medium, in fact, I wanted to go w/ spicy but the waitress warned me so I trusted her.  OMG!  The medium made my nose run and scalp itch!!!!  SPICE-EHHHH!! But between the two of us, we finished all of our food. LOL!    I am now officially a fan of this place!  I loved it so much that I came in to order a pound of shrimp to go all for myself!  (This time I was smart enough to go easy and just go w/ the mild!)  I do suggest going there right when they open at 12pm because right after that, the wait can get pretty long!"}
{"text":"Just three days ago, my heart was broken. It was love at first bite. I would marry this crab, but I realized that  I can't have my crab and eat it too. I am seriously having withdrawals, which is why I am returning again. And again later this week. And next week."}
{"text":"If you like spiciness, this is the place for you. It is not like those chemical spicy, it is truly homemade spices with real taste.   The servers and hostesses are prompt with your ordered, food come out fresh, and tasted great every time. Can't go wrong here, well except if you have a stomach issue, if you know what I mean!  Love it!"}
{"text":"I gave it three stars because the flavor was good!! Crawfish was not fresh I can tell it was frozen and some of the meat was mushy!"}
{"text":"Ohh man that was awsome... The hot n juicy mild shrimp was good!!"}
{"text":"Half our group waited for over an hour for food after the others were done because of a mess up by the waitress. The waitress and manager had a huge attitude about it while arguing instead of caring to rectify the situation. This was my first time and I would never come back!"}
{"text":"Food was okay but next day me and my friend both got food poisoning. Now when I think about crawfish I feel sick. We're definitely never coming back to this place again."}
{"text":"I love this place. So tasty. They fly in craw fish from Louisiana daily. You get your craw fish in a plastic bag that has been boiled. It's filled with the spice that you chose, corn on the cob and a potato. What makes these craw fish so good is the seasonings used. There's a few different flavor choices. I always get the special. It's all of the flavors together. Then there is the Spice level. Beware! Spicy is Spicy! I have yet to try the Extra Spicy. There are no utensils or plates. You eat off the plastic table cloth and you even get a bib. I was never a fan of craw fish until now. One of my favorite places in Vegas."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful experience. Great food and drink and an above and beyond waitress named Grace. she was helpful from the start and got us our order quick and the service was impeccable."}
{"text":"Wowwowowowoowow all I can say . It was our first time coming here because a friend recommend it to us . We came around 7:30 when it wasn't too busy . Our server Selena was AMAZING . She explained the menu very detailed to us which made ordering super easy . She also mentioned the beer specials and the bogo for blue crab. We ended up order blue crab with hot n juicy medium and shrimp with the same . It was so good I was licking the sauce off my fingers . Can't wait to come back again !"}
{"text":"Looking for food with a lot of flavor?! You will not find anything like it! The crawfish and shrimp is delicious and not to mention Juicy! You can pick a few different flavors or combine them all together. Then choose to have it mild to extra spicy. I like spicy food so I chose extra spicy. It's delicious! It's a small little restaurant but the atmosphere inside is lively and inviting. the staff is not the best, the waitress never came back to fill my water or ask me if everything is alright even when I told her this was my first visit. I also mentioned I heard about the restaurant from Man Vs. food to her and she wasn't impressed or cared at all. Even though they had people waiting outside, doesn't mean she should not give me great service. It wasn't just me, the tables around me did not get any attention either. I will go back to this place because of their Awesome Crawfish and Sauce! Wish we had one here in Minnesota!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. The best shrimp and crawfish I have ever had. Watch out for the extra spicy."}
{"text":"Spicy and delicious, this place delivers! Next time I'm in Vegas Ill be back. Don't get too excited about the Man vs. Food thing though this place has it's own character."}
{"text":"I have been in the service industries for twenty five years, I've worked at the best bars in las vegas and I know the difference between good service and someone making me feel like I'm part of there family.not only do I love the food there ,but on my last stop the waitress emeli made me feel like I was part of there family.it was refreshing to get that kind of service it really made me and my girlfriends night.great food and always great service.thank you hot and juicy...."}
{"text":"The sauces were kind of gross and boiling crab is much better food wise. This is only getting more than one star because the employees were really nice. But they didn't allow us to bring in our Bobas saying there's no outside food allowed but there was a table that had Starbucks with them. Also potatoes weren't cooked all the way."}
{"text":"The food was really good but I prefer the other Hot n Juicy because the service there is A LOT better. The waitress we had tonight seemed like she didn't want to be there at all and had an attitude. Only checked on us once right after we got our food and that was it. The other hot n juicy's staff is super attentive and very nice even when I came there during a dinner rush."}
{"text":"Really good seafood, decent pricing. Wear the gloves!"}
{"text":"Must stop when in Vegas.  We run up $150 tabs on just crawfish."}
{"text":"I will just start by saying I do not enjoy giving bad reviews.  My boyfriend and I went for a late lunch/early dinner. The restaurant was basically empty. We were seated right away. The server brought us out drinks and explained how to order and advised that whatever spice we would normally order to go a step below when ordering. My boyfriend hates spicy food so ordered a pound of crawfish in garlic butter seasoning and \"baby spice\" (lowest) spice level. I ordered a pound of crawfish with the hot and juicy seasoning and spicy (instead of my normal extra spicy due to the earlier recommendation).  The order was dropped off. I had to look up a YouTube video on how to eat crawfish since the waitress did not ask if we knew how and didn't explain how.  The food was decent which is the only reason I gave 2 stars. Before the meal was brought out our waitress was always visible. Once the food hit the table she disappeared. I tried my boyfriends food which was incredibly spicy while mine was not even a little hot.  So between the service, lack of info, and the music (10+ usher songs in a row) we had to get out ASAP and unfortunately will not be returning"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner last night with a party of 9. I got the étouffée and a pound of Hot N Juicy medium shrimp with sausage and corn and ended up eating off of other people's food. i could not get enough!!!! the food and service was excellent and it was extremely busy! Our server Kayla was super attentive and catered to our every need (and we can be really needy LOL) we will be coming back and i definitely recommend our server to anyone going in to eat."}
{"text":"We have eaten at both restaurants on Spring Mountain. We liked the larger restaurant better, but both are great. The shrimp was of high quality, and tasted great.  The off the strip restaurants are worth the trip. More economical and better food!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Soo I'm pretty picky (no pun intended) about my crawfish and shrimp and seafood in general... However I came here and my food was awesome my server Ali was great also. Food was a 10. Price is good and I can't wait to come back. Even though last time I was here and it was also amazing... This time I didn't get my super hot server Alex but that's ok. We can't always get everything we want. A + hot n juicy. A+   Sincerely super full happy customer"}
{"text":"It's 2pm, and it's time for the only meal of the day. If you've had your fair share of buffets, I think Hot N Juicey is a great alternative. Awesome selection of seafood, sauce with a great spicy kick, and you get to attack your food with all the barbarity you can muster.  Since the four of us were starving, we ordered a portion of cajun fries, a portion of sweet potato fries, a dozen oysters and 4lbs of shrimp. Yeah, that's way too much food. The fries had good flavour but to me, they just took up unnecessary tummy space. The oysters were small and scrawny but still had a nice, fresh taste. The shrimp on the other hand, was impressive. They were big and filled us up fast. We went with the spicy Hot N Juicy sauce, and we were all feeling a little burning around our lips. Very satisfying."}
{"text":"I usually hang in Chinatown, but the sinks outside! the bathroom! Brilliant! Be sure to ask for Robin, she's one of the friendliest servers in the world, and was very gentle with the first timers I brought along. Also had the fried catfish for the first time, and was amazed how good it was."}
{"text":"This pace is soo good,me an my wife found the original in Vegas 5 years ago,and I love it"}
{"text":"The Portions on shrimp appeared a little skimped this time around, or it may be cc and be are giving bigger portions. Overall, it's as expected."}
{"text":"Wow!!!! Better then expected we ordered 2lbs of shrimp,1lb of crawfish 2 corn ,6 slices sausage and Cajun fries ,$48 we had the hot and juicy sauce-spicy which had the right amount of heat,the boil had a pleasant orange taste to it. Service was very good,kept the drinks full . Food came out fast always a plus. Dessert at baskin Robbins to put out the fire, perfect meal"}
{"text":"Disappointing, chicken nuggets taste & look EXACTLY like McDonalds!  The crawfish were small and not impressive, but the snow crabs were good."}
{"text":"Today's visit wasn't too shabby... usually when I come I get piss poor service. This time I was prepared had a timer & pen/paper to track how long we were gonna wait because usually the fryer is \"always backed up\" even though it's 1/2 vacant or you get stuck with a ghost for a waiter.... I think our waitress saw our timer dammit but even so it was quite a wait here's the break down  2min - had drinks (usually this alone is 6-10min) 14 min - had fried calamari appetizer 16 min-checked on us for the 1st time since drinks 19 1/2 min - shrimp basket finally came 21 min - crab legs came finally So overall compared to prior visits waiting 30/40min+ for food wasn't too bad.  P.S. (per my sis) the \"mild\" spice level is stupid hot her lips are burning... stick with the baby spice she says. I liked it but I love extra spicy"}
{"text":"The food was awesome and we received very attentive service from the entire staff, especially Jessica!  Coming back everytime we're in town."}
{"text":"The worst food ever the batter for fried foods is over salty you can't taste the fish or shrimp etc the crab legs, were ok . They need to reinvent and rethink a lot of they're recipe. I will never go there again."}
{"text":"Ever since we saw this place on Man v Food, we've been stopping in when we're in town. The crawfish are too much work for the meat you get but we love the shrimp, crab & sausage. The corn & potatoes are great soaked in the spicy sauce! Get here in the early afternoon to avoid the lines..."}
{"text":"\"Hands down\"!!! This place was so good we had to have it again before leaving Vegas... First time there we ordered the crawfish which I am not to fond of... Calamari was pretty good...  we also ordered shrimps.... the shrimps were so juicy and delicious so much flavor!!! We had the butter garlic, and also lemon pepper I would highly recommend these 2 flavors. We also tried the Cajun seasoning and I am not a spicy person so didn't care much for it.... Anyhow when in Vegas this is one spot to definitely check out :D"}
{"text":"This is one of those places you have to try ONCE for the experience.  We had two pounds of the Garlic Butter crawfish, and one pound of Lemon Pepper Shrimp.  We got the shrimp first and it was really, really good! We chose medium spicy and it was perfect. Only $7.99!  Not too shabby.  Then we got the crawfish. Tiny, overly spicy (medium too), and NO MEAT!  I didn't expect it to be that meaty, but I'm talking TINY. We asked the server and she did admit we came off season and the meat is pretty much non-existent, but we wish someone told us first and we would have gotten more shrimp instead.  Wasn't busy on a Thursday afternoon. This is the newer location and it was clean and plenty of parking. Not too far from the strip if you drive."}
{"text":"5 STARS for GREAT SERVICE**** Go Go Go for Noemy (server)"}
{"text":"This restaurant lives up to it's name.  Wow it was good.  A friend took us to this restaurant and my wife really enjoyed it.  So on our last trip to Vegas, she had to go back.  It was just as good as the first time.  Restaurant offers no plates that I know of, so it can get messy.  Recommend any of the boiled items - we had the shrimp and crawfish and to steer away from the fried stuff (the fried shrimp was nothing special)."}
{"text":"Sweet potato fries and medium H n' J shrimp.  The two main reasons I come here.  The wife loves the snow crab legs too.  A good, cheapish seafood place to meet the Cajun cravings.  The garlic in the food stays with you for a few days (fingers, breath, skin), but if you can hang, it's pretty dang tasty.  Be prepared for waits up to an hour though.  We have never just walked in and gotten seating, at all hours of the day."}
{"text":"Extremely small dinning area making it uncomfortable because everybody keeps running into you and the food is also extremely salty. My personal favorite is Angry Carb and BBQ Shack!"}
{"text":"I ordered the fried shrimp & Cajun fries (half/half) and I was very disappointed in the breading of the fried shrimp. It was over cooked & too much breading. The Cajun fries okay. The hot N juicy shrimp medium was good!"}
{"text":"This is why we love Yelp. Helps us find places like Hot n Juicy Crawfish. Do yourself a favor, get off the strip and check this place out. This place is awesome!!! Food is great and a offers different dining experience. Our server Robin was very helpful assisting us to select what we wanted and how we wanted it prepared."}
{"text":"Flavor on point!! Went on a Saturday afternoon. Ordered the get your feet wet and the drool with hot n juicy seasoning. Spice level medium. If you can't take spicy well I suggest getting mild. Service was really good. If you're in the mood for some spicy seafood this is the place to go. Next time I'm in town definily coming back here."}
{"text":"First of all, our server Lazar made an amazing experience even better! Great service excellent food!! Snow crab & shrimp was the best"}
{"text":"The newer location has less of a wait and fewer tourists."}
{"text":"Well. This was an impulse better left ignored.  There are only two people staffing the floor, and food takes a long time. Considering that nothing is peeled or cleaned,  I have no idea why this is so.   We ordered a half pound of shrimp and a pound of snow crab. They were eventually delivered in plastic bags. After wrestling the meat from the shells we are messy, grumpy, and still hungry.   The side sweet potato fries for $6 was flavorless.   I don't believe I will come again. After removing the heads and legs from my shrimp I was left with little to eat. And it was gross. I feel like I need a Silkwood shower.  Eta: the waitress had see thru leggings. You could see her too small panties. I am not sure she intended to look like that, she seemed sweet, but where was management?"}
{"text":"Normally people rave about Hot N Juicy. It's just okay for me. I've been at different times of the day. I have gone at 10:30 and stayed until midnight. The last time I went was in the middle of the afternoon at around 1:30. The service was really good. Granted, there were only 3 or 4 tables, but they were still really attentive. I arrived first and waited for my friend. They seated me immediately me and brought me water and my bib. I did have to wait for my friend for a bit as she ran on Filipino time. The servers kept checking on me to ask me if I was ready to order.    We both ordered a half pound of shrimp. It is very nice that with shrimp, we can order half a pound. My friend ordered the lemon pepper medium spicy. I ordered hot n juicy medium spicy as well. I love the taste of mine. Whenever I order shrimp, I always get lemons, limes, salt and pepper and dip my shrimp in it.   This is very very messy, so I would never order shrimp to go because it's a mess.   I think part of the reason is that I get so grossed out because the shrimp isn't peeled and deveinned, so you still that gross line that you can see while you eat. Next time, I might just devein all my shrimp after peeling it.  Something else that bothers me about the shrimp is that the flavor is all encased on the outside. The actual shrimp has no flavor. After I peel the shrimp, I still have to drench it in sauce.   The service is very superior here, though!"}
{"text":"they were busy, which is to be expected since it was a long weekend and their food is good. i've been here multiple times and have brought friends and family. we ordered some appetizers. our entire meal came before the appetizers. when asked about it our waiter sarcastically snapped that 'all food is prepared fresh, therefore it takes some time to cook'. rude!  shortly thereafter a second waitress came by to let us know the fryer was running behind because they were busy and thanked us for our patience. :)  all waiter #1 had to do was let us know nicely. we came for the food, not for the attitude. shrimp and crab were tasty. calamari appetizer was really good."}
{"text":"Totally disappointed. Went to this place per a friend's recommendation... There's not enough parking space and the clientele is a little ghetto. If you had Boiling Crab, the \"whole shebang\" is definitely better than the \"hot n juicy\" seasoning. The service sucks! Our server didn't even stop by to check on us if we needed anything so we had to get some random server's attention to get us something we needed. I asked for a sheller and was told that they don't have enough utensils so I'm going to have to wait until the other customer's done with it. Three other tables next to is were told the same thing. How about investing in some cheap plastic ones, especially that you're on a seafood business. Oh yeah... The crawfish tasted old. As far as pricing is concerned, it's cheaper than Boiling Crab, but you get what you paid for. I'd say... Boiling Crab is waaaaayyyy better--- hands down!"}
{"text":"I have been to this location twice now. My first experience was great but this time wasn't.  I was seated right away and a waitress got our drinks out pretty quickly.  We ordered two lbs of spicy hot n' juicy shrimp.  The waitress asked if we would like it in two bags I said \"yes please, and some corn in both bags.\" We also ordered some rice.  Our rice came out first and it was SERIOUSLY over cooked.  To the point where it had a weird taste.  A different waitress then came to our table and dropped one bag of 2 lbs of shrimp on the table with no corn.  I then got the attention of a different waitress and asked if we had the right food. I explained to her that the waitress we ordered from said we could have 2 bags of shrimp with 1 lb each and that we ordered corn.  She then took the bag back and came back with 2 bags of shrimp and no corn.  A different lady then brought out two things of corn soaked in sauce. Which was nice even though it wasn't in the bag.  Service was pretty terrible especially when I made it known exactly what I wanted from my initial food order to ensure the waitress would not have to run back and forth with different requests.  The shrimp tasted okay but was kind of mushy.  The rice was gross and super over cooked like I said before.  I will most likely try this location again only because my boyfriend enjoys the atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is a great seafood place. If you're in the mood for something special try this place out. I love the sauces here,  but bit much of butter in some of the sauces so be warned."}
{"text":"The homies always drag me here when in Vegas. They love it. I'm not a fan of crawfish. But must say this place is pretty good. Must try!"}
{"text":"I really don't know what the big deal is... Not impressed at all. It seem to me there is a lot of spice not a lot of flavor. Seemed super overpriced"}
{"text":"We went in early February and had a fantastic time. The shrimp was delicious and just what we wanted. Our server, AJ, was attentive and friendly without being pushy. We had the lemon-pepper shrimp and garlic butter crab. We were very glad that we took AJ's suggestion of mild for the spice level! It had great heat, but didn't ruin the flavor. Any hotter would have been too much for me. It was great food complimented by great service. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Have been there several times,disappointed never have the Blue Crab! We will call on our way and see if Blue Crab is in they always seem to say, we had it the day before but sells out quickly.  Was told by Manager they get their shipment in on Fridays, went there today and low and behold no blue crab!  I ordered  my usual shrimp hot and juicy extra spicy.  Love the spice its hot but enjoyable, the only disappointing thing is the shrimp are sometimes mushy and hard to peel from their shell.   On on our last visit,told the manager about this and she stated that next time tell them not to cook too much.  Today we did tell our server who mentioned to the cooks and still had shrimp hard to peel.  That is disappointing for the price that you pay per pound, however again the sauce was hot and enjoyable.  Cajun fries are very yummy wish they were served with something other than ketsup.  A nice remoulade sauce or ranch would be awesome.  Our server Philip was excellent!  He was very attentive and provided excellent service. Would give him 5 star review."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  We had 2 lbs of snow crab and a pound of Alaskan King.  Some rice and a Diet Coke later our tab was only $70 including  Service was very friendly.  I'm a big fan"}
{"text":"Pretty good food.  Alot of work though.  I would pay extra for someone to open the Crawfish for me.  That doesn't make me a bad person."}
{"text":"Came here a week ago, the food is phenomenal.  I've been dreaming about the shrimp ever since. Stopped by today and picked up takeout. The food is fantastic. We had fantastic service, different servers kept coming by but we constantly had drinks, beer, anything we needed. I hope this place sticks around for a long time!"}
{"text":"This place is very good. I always get the same thing when I come. 1lb of shrimp hot n juicy flavor. My husband gets a 1lb of shrimp garlic butter. We split a Cajun fry. So good. The spicy level is always on point.   This place is really similar to a place called crab hut in San Diego that We go to frequently. Both are good. Love the fresh garlic that they use and the Asian spices."}
{"text":"Saw this place on Man vs. Food and had to go since I am a big fan of crawfish. So the next time I hit Vegas I went beofre I hit the road home, when I arrived they weren't open yet but already had customers waiting including myself. Crawfish were awsome nice size and  spicy enough to enjoy and not annoy."}
{"text":"Love this place, Im new to the area and have been to two locations. Food is great, service is as well. We had the same server Steven at both locations, he's awesome. Will be going back often!"}
{"text":"Wear a short sleeve shirt and leave the jewelry at home. This is a messy, low key, awesomely fun dining experience. I get 3 lbs. of crawfish with hot n juicy medium sauce, once a WEEK. That's how much I love this place. Every time I have friends in town, I bring them here, and I have yet to get a bad review. The staff is friendly, but busy. I always tip well; my drink is always full and they remember me :)  EAT HERE! I don't know what else to say beyond that. Yum!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in Vegas! I get the hot n juicy medium for a sauce, and I crave it days after eating. The staff is friendly, the food amazing and interactive. I always take visitors here for a great time! But you smell like garlic all day, so make sure you don't have any important meetings later on. Or even if you do, totally worth it!"}
{"text":"We came in on Sunday. It was pretty busy as to be expected. However the service was horrible. Not only was my sons food extremely late but a lot of other peoples good was not out quickly. 20 minutes into my drive home I started throwing up and that didn't stop until a few hours later. My husband also got extremely sick. I'd heard great things about this place but after my experience I will not be coming back. So disappointed..."}
{"text":"Okay I would give them 5 stars but they never have blue crab or fritters!  Hot n juicy is so legit! Omg. The flavor is so amazing. ..flavorful. .savory..spicy..tangy...its insane! I love seafood.. tho if u aren't a fan of seafood ...I wouldn't recommend it. My bf and I always share the \"get your feet wet \" combo. Its comes with a pound of crawfish ...pound of shrimp...12 mini sausages. .corn..and potatoes.  Its so yummy! Hot n juicy is one of my favorite spots in Vegas. Get some !!"}
{"text":"Yup, I'm a fan. I wasn't super thrilled to try this place out but me and my boyfriend shared a bag of shrimp with 2 sides of rice (big portions) with fish and chips. We are big eaters and rarely take food home... We took home 1 side of rice with still half a bag left of shrimp. Mouth watering!"}
{"text":"Came here on a late weekday night and there was no wait at all unlike all the Boiling Crab locations I've been to. Waiters were attentive and the place was clean and open.   I like the whole shabang sauce at boiling crab much more than the equivalent at this place. Corn tasted like it had been frozen and refrozen multiple times.  They don't charge you for water unlike BC but their cups are tall, flimsy and lid less. I spilled my cup within the first five minutes and before I left, a woman at the other table did the same."}
{"text":"The best shrimp by pound that I had and it's only $12 something. It was so juicy and my garlic butter sauce complements the taste. Best of all I was in a hurry because I had to go to work and I told the hostess and within 3 minutes I got my order so fresh, hot and juicy. This is my favorite for seafood and will be back next month."}
{"text":"Husband and I come here six months ago! We enjoyed our food  delicious. The only thing he dislike eating with hands and the bib."}
{"text":"Great service, very friendly wait staff. They were out of fresh crawfish so we went for the boiled fresh shrimp with the signature Hot n Juicy seasoning. Shrimp were very good and OMG, this sauce is freaking amazing!!!  We ended up dipping our fries in the sauce and licked every bit off of our plastic gloves."}
{"text":"We were a party of 6 and we put away at least 4 lbs of snow crab, 4 lbs of shrimp, 8 lbs of crawfish, 2 orders of fried catfish, plus corn for everyone. The food was excellent. After eating on the strip, we wanted something different. This was well worth it. We should have gone there earlier in the trip. Martha our waitress was extremely helpful and patient. This is a must stop for lunch when in Vegas."}
{"text":"I can actually say I HATE this place! The food is way overpriced, the staff is always rude, my boyfriend and I have been there twice both times we sat most of the meal with empty drinks. Last time we went with his family and his father literally did not get his iced tea until I asked to speak with a manager and we were almost done with the meal. When I spoke with the manager he did not seem to care at all until I told him I would be writing a review online and that I would like the owners card.  I had dropped my fries at one point (again this is the second visit) and the server picked them up off the ground asked me if I wanted them still. I said no I wanted fresh fries. It took about 20 minutes for me to get new fries. I was paranoid after that the staff might spit in my food, but really what else could I do. Overall it was a waste of my money and patience I will save my patronage for a place that won't offer me fries off the floor...and I think I should add that any time I asked for something the staff made me feel like I was bothering them."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  Fantastic deep fried catfish.  Excellent cajon fries that I need ranch dressing  to cool them down.  I can't wait to come back and try the specialty seafood!  Good number to TVs for sports too."}
{"text":"Really really good food but the wait takes forever at times. Came here a few times and I only had one good experience and that was with marina. Really good server! If you go I would only recommend having her."}
{"text":"Here is best place to me and my boyfriend!!! We like to enjoy with spicy food . That's why we always order shrimp with extra spicy!!!!! And we often order potato with shrimp......  This combo is so fantastic !"}
{"text":"When I saw this place we were expecting NOLA cajun crawfish. It was far from it.  The food  good for the most part, the spices and sauce were overwhelming. It was not spicy since i got mild. It was just so much in the bag. New Orleans crawfish boil is simpler but with big flavor. But i can see why people might like it here. Just not my cup of tea. However, the service was excellent. I am curious of how much plastic, styrofoam  and paper they throw out!"}
{"text":"Sooo good! Service was slightly delayed and awkward but the two girls serving all the tables tried the best they could. Food= phenomenal. Hot n Juicy sauce and lemon pepper were amazing. Corn fritters were also delish. Although, the ranch as a dipping sauce was not. Dip the fritters into the Hot n Juicy sauce instead for a more savory option.. Will definitely return when the crawfish is fresh and not frozen!"}
{"text":"OH MY GOODNESS. So good. The whole dining experience is special. The food is amazing. The only warning is that parking sucks, but so worth it."}
{"text":"Saw this place on Man Vs Food and definitely wanted to try this place out. I've gone to Boiling Crab in San Jose, CA and this place blows them out of the water, HANDS DOWN!!! I came out on a WED night and it wasn't packed. I wonder how it is on the weekends. The Staff is nice and the place is great for a group of friends. I recommend sharing food as most items on the list is served in pounds. *WATCH OUT* the sauce is *HOT* I love spicy food so I order the MEDUIM and even that was a little to HOT for me!!! The sauce is one of the best and most flavorful I've had. If you've gone to other places, you gotta try this place out!!!  Cajun Fries: A Sausage: A HotNJuicy Special Sauce: A  Medium Spice Level: (HOT!!!) King Crab Legs: A Snow Crab: B Crawfish: C (NOT IN SEASON) Shrimp: B"}
{"text":"I am giving 5 stars to our server. Being a Saturday afternoon we did have to wait but Camille was the best. With all of the chaos she was the sweetest. The food runner messed up on our order but she made sure we got the correct items sent.  The food was good too. We got the king crab legs with the garlic seasoning and the shrimp with the hot n juicy. Both flavors were great.  I would go back for Camille and the food."}
{"text":"I really love this place.. The better crawfish cajun in town.. Awesome customer service"}
{"text":"Loved this place, after seeing it on man v food i had to try it and it didnt disappoint the spicy scauce with the crawfish and corn together with the cajun fries was lovley."}
{"text":"Came here for a second time and I have to say I'm disappointed, especially since this visit was worse than the first time I visited. The only thing that went well was the flavoring on the seafood. Now to list all the things that went wrong: the food, and the service was one of the worst I've had. The food was great until one of the clams I opened had pure dirt inside and was definitely not fresh. The shrimp was burnt and the rice wasn't fresh. Now to elaborate on the service. When we asked for utensils, gloves, and bibs, our waitress brought only one of the three and needed to be reminded 3 times. Not only that, she forgot our drinks and after we asked about it multiple times, she still forgot about it so we gave up and just canceled the drinks. Lastly, when she handed us the check, there were open mints inside the check book.. That's just nasty.. I don't know how service could be this bad when it was before peak dinner hours. This location definitely needs change and better management."}
{"text":"Always try and stop in to this location for hot n juicy when I'm in Vegas. It's a nice local vibe, with incredibly friendly servers and great food. They even let you sample some food to be sure you will be happy with your order. Love it during crawfish season but their frozen stock when the fresh ones run out are still great too. Fun place to watch a football game too. Buy one get one free beers during the season!"}
{"text":"Hot N Juicy sauce is the best!  Not too salty and was warned the mild was spicy, but I didn't think it was.  Didn't take long to get seated on a Monday evening at 5 pm. Staff was great and very attentive.  Can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great music and even better food! Try the lemon pepper shrimp and the hot and juicy crab legs!!! Amazing!"}
{"text":"Delicious!!! Get the snow crab with garlic butter and the shrimp with spicy Cajun sauce...soooo good..don't wear long sleeves..or fancy clothes..because your gonna get messy!!! But great atmosphere, good food, ok service."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  Came here on Saturday before they opened so we could nab a parking space and were one of the first customers there.  It was our first time there so we got 2 lbs crawfish, a pound king crab legs, a pound of Dungeness crab and some Cajun fries.  We got the hot n juicy seasoning in medium and it was perfect!  Perhaps a bit salty for my taste but the flavors were explosive in a good way.  My tongue was dancing.  They use lots of garlic so you will smell like garlic afterwards.  Tip, if you use your bare hands, ask for some lemon wedges to wipe your fingers down to help tame the seafood and garlic smells before doing a final wash with soap and water.  Because soap and water alone isn't enough to combat the garlic!  I can eat spicy and the medium was spicy but not anything you can't handle.  My party doesn't eat too spicy so that's why we opted for the medium level.  But anywho, the crawfish that day was frozen but still they were so delicious!  The Dungeness crab was super juicy and soft.  Everything tasted so amazing that we put in another order of crawfish and crabs!  And we devoured about 11 lbs of shellfish altogether.  On top of that, we had fries and some baskets to wash it all down :).   Wish there was a hot n juicy where I live.  Come here to satisfy your Cajun shellfish hunger and come early for parking, totally worth camping out for this joint in the hot desert heat!"}
{"text":"Althought the food deserves 5 stars, I gave this place 2 stars on my first visit due to poor service. Decided to give them a second chance. Albeit, they were a lot slower, tonight was much better. We were greeted at the door and our server was a doll. And as always, the food was excellent!"}
{"text":"First time here and it was amazing! The staff was incredibly friendly and energetic, our servers name was Dan and he was great! The food was hot& fresh and I loved the flavors! Def coming back for the butterfly shrimp"}
{"text":"I went to Hot n Juicy in Vegas  for the first time this past week and was somewhat disappointed! Overall, the food was good, not the best, but still good. The only thing I must say is that you do have to be willing to get over the giant shrimp heads, eyes, & whiskers! (I had no idea) What disappointed me though, was the service, the server didn't seemed interested in being there, and unconcerned when we asked questions. Also, the portions are very big when it comes to the shrimp! I asked the server if she thought I should get a half a pound or whole, and she answered that the half only came with a few shrimp and gave a face like not a good choice, so I got the full pound and my hubby not that big on shrimp, got the half. I wished I had a picture, but the half was more than a few shrimp, and perfect to suffice any shrimp lover, so I did feel misled, as far as that goes. Needless to say, I ended up giving my grandmother the rest of my shrimp from my pound! It also took a good 15 minutes to get someone to come by with our check, even after my husband told our server. I'm not sure if we will be returning to this location or even the restaurant for that matter due to the service, which I'm all about, lol. There are plenty of other places like this around, that probably make you feel  more welcome and have excellent service!"}
{"text":"food took forever to come out and servers didnt even check on us. my rice was cold by the time the food came out. overall the food was good."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at Hot and Juicy. My waitress was very helpful and explained everything to me, I even was given a crawfish sample as it was my first time trying them. I ordered the hot and juicy mild crawfish and garlic shrimp. Boy was it tasty. You definitely are going to need gloves to tear these guys apart, as they are saturated with the sauces. DONT BE AFRAID to get down and dirty. Personally, I enjoyed the shrimp more because there is a lot more meat, they are healthy shrimp. The crawfish have tiny tails but are equally as tasty. If you are going solely to eat the crawfish and have a big appetite, you're going to need a few pounds of those bad boys. Overall, great experience and will be back soon, hopefully visiting the California location."}
{"text":"I love this location, love the food, however they have a VERY snobby, uncaring, unprofessional manager.  I'm not sure if I got her name correctly but it's Gem, Gen or close to it.  When I had questions about the quantity of crab legs in the bag, she snatched it up from the table, rolled her eyes and said \"do you want me to take these back?\"  No explanation or not even trying to satisfy me with an answer or solution. This is the second time I've encountered unprofessionalism from her. Once when I was there, she was outwardly scolding one of the waiters and in eyeshot of customers fussed at him then called him \"white boy.\"  She will not be the one that stops me from going to Hot & Juicy however higher management needs to send her to customer service school or fire her."}
{"text":"The food does not come out all at once. my boyfriend and i waited 20min to be seated, 45min for our food. My food came 15min before his and i knew he was starving so i waited to eat mine to be polite. It took them 45min to make some french fries so i cancelled that order. On top of them taking forever, my crawfish were small and disgusting. It is the middle of march the crawfish should be larger and IN SEASON. On top of their \"C\" grade from the health department, im pretty sure the crawfish come from China"}
{"text":"I give it 4 stars because I still like Boiling Crab (whole shebang) after trying HNJ out. Service was subpar. Waitress kept forgetting to bring us what we asked for so we told her not to bring it after we were done with our order."}
{"text":"I like this place and agree with everyone else...  The crawfish was yum.  The seasoning was perfect with the perfect amount of spice.  Thank you for the gradual scale of spicyness.  Can I get some wet wipes or something though?  Service is kind of slow.  It was busy but you would think they would compensate with more than one or two servers on a Friday night."}
{"text":"Located off the Strip but definitely worth the trip! Hot N Juicy lives up to its name. Get the Canjun spicey sauce with crawfish, shrimp, crab or other crustaceans. I personally found Hot N Juicy's crawfish a bit on the small side. However the sauce is unbelievable! Service can be a bit slow. Price is extremely fair. Parking can be a pain as the lot is small and you may have to park outside on the streets."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of having Yasmine ( believe that her name) wait on our table, friendly and sociable. Loved her attentiveness to what was needed. Came back to check up on us as well. we love this restaurant and having good customer service make the lunch/dinner more better. thank you!!"}
{"text":"We come here once or twice a month. Food is always great. Aubree served us last night and was absolutely wonderful in spite of situation out of her control. This isn't the first time Aubree has served us and she's always been great! We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Boiling Crab is nothing compared to Hot N' Juicy!  It's just something about their finger lickin' good seasonings.  I highly recommend the hot n' juicy special sauce on the side. Also, the shrimp / crab boil is better than the crawfish when it is out of season."}
{"text":"This Place....A must go. We had almost everything they have to offer. We had 1lb. Of crawfish, 1.5 lbs. of the shrimp, and we got an entire 1.8 lb lobster and also fries and corn. It was so so so so so good. Our lobster was so good, the staff even asked to take a pic of it before we ate. The staff was very friendly as well. We would go here every time we go to Vegas. We got the normal hot n juicy baby spice which was perfect. Not super spicy but not mild. We destroyed that meal!!!!"}
{"text":"SHOUT OUT TO KAROL. It was packed she was polite and kept out water cups full. Food came out in a timely manner! Hadn't visited in a while glad they still have it!"}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would! We were seated quickly, then sat for at least 10 minutes before a waiter made contact with us. Ordered 2 beers and one pound crawfish. Took awhile for beers to arrive. We then waited 30+ minutes before our server came to our table but only because we signalled to him. He apologized for our wait. Another 15+ minutes passed with no further contact. My son chased after the server and said we'd just like our check and we were no longer interested in crawfish. Paid bill - no tip - and went to front of house where my son asked for the managet. He told her our story to which she replied \"Oh I only manage the front of the house, not the kitchen.\" WHAT??? She then asked if we'd stay if she gave us 2 pounds of crawfish for free. Um.....no, we've been here over an hour and have not been served what we ordered right off the bat. We went to In'n'Out Burger and had a delicious meal that was ready in 5 minutes even though it was very crowded!"}
{"text":"Food: 4.5 stars Service: 4.5 stars Price: 4. 5 stars  This restaurant is located in a small not-so-good looking plaza off the strip near the Chinatown area. Based on the reviews from Yelp, we ordered one pound of shrimp $9.99, not the crawfish as people said they don't taste as good as the shrimp. We also ordered 1/2 dozen of the sausage $2.50 and a bowl of Etouffee soup $6.79. The Etouffee soup is like a gumbo soup, but with seafood in it. Taste super good and MUST TRY! The shrimps and the sausage came in one plastic bag. The shrimps were yummy and juicy, but not spicy at all because we ordered it in mild. Next time we would try medium. The sausage wasn't very special, so we will skip it next time.   The service was great. The waiters were very polite and attentive. They refilled our soda three times. I like the plastic bib that they passed out because you will need it if you don't want to get stains on your shirt. It's a great experience. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here tonight. (we tried a few weeks ago but they were out of crawfish) The service was promo friendly, and the atmosphere was fun. The food was good. We ordered the hot n juicy sauce mild. Boy did it still have a kick. So if you like it spicy you don't have to look any further than mild. We almost ordered medium, but for the first time mild was the way to go and we love spicy food.  We ordered two lbs of crawfish and one lb. of shrimp. Overall I would just get the shrimp for $10 a lb. the crawfish was a bit of a disappointment mainly because most of them were super tiny and it was not worth all that work to get a tiny bit from the tail.  The hostess did recommend that next time to try the lemon pepper dungeonus crab."}
{"text":"Amazing. Didn't even get the chance to take a pic. Hot n juicy spices and mild were PERFECT. I want to come back every day I'm here."}
{"text":"It was my 2nd time in this store and I brought my hubby and in-laws who never been here before, the greeter lady gave us 25-30 mins.waiting time but only 11mins after, got a message that our table is ready, that is too early and we love it.My mom-in-law is a picky eater and loves to criticize but this time, I've never heard any complaint or bad criticism and all I can hear is the seafood is awesome and yummy!!we ordered Snow crab legs,shrimp and soft shell crab basket with delicious cajun potato fries and my family really love it all and wanted to go back soon!! This store have the best sauce ever and kudos to their kind and nice server \"Emily\" & to the rest of the crews keep up the good work!!But please make sure no longer waiting time and no delays on food serving and every server should have designated assigned tables to be serve/assist for easy follow up with the orders and needs of customers."}
{"text":"OMG!   This place is awsome.  Decently priced and fun!  The the servers don't seem to have as much fun as everyone else, but who could blame them.  Food is served quickly and drinks are always filled!  Great array of flavors and hotness, easy and simple seating.  Messy as hell, but they even give you bibs, paper towels and wipeys!  Plus the clean up is the best!  Great for everyone ......as long as you know how to have fun with your food!"}
{"text":"I love a place where you can get down n dirty while ya eat! That's how you really get to enjoy food and not try to be so proper all the time. This place is a ok size establishment, the service could be a bit quicker. I had 2lbs of crawfish with their Hot N Juicy special spicy seasoning which was off the hook, so flavorful!! Came with corn, potatoes and a side of sausage all packed up into one bag to mix in with all the other flavors (genius). I have to say though, especially since I had the spicy seasoning, my hands and somehow my car smelled like seafood for a couple days LOL but I didn't mind! Hot N Juicy does stick to their name and it's nice to have such seafood spot out here in the desert!"}
{"text":"So I am writing this review on behalf of a misfortune.  My family, friends and I always eat at this location, though I don't really leave a bad review, tonight really pushed it. And here's to why I left this review.   I ordered a to-go pound of shrimp \"BABY SPICE\" as also listed on receipt. Upon coming home and started eating, the sauce suddenly starts to become really spicy. I say this because by now I already know how they used to serve \"BABY SPICE\" being a regular here. I was so disappointed because I was really looking forward to it and excited to come home and eat. Turns out it wasn't quite as expected.  This was the 2nd time it happened to me. The 1st time was when we were eating in and I just let it go and let them redeem theirselves. However it happened again today and what's worst was it happen when I was really looking forward to it! PLEASE HAVE SOME CONSISTENCY!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Where else can you go and have little eyes looking at you as you tear there heads off and eat them..  Everything tastes great and the beer is cheap."}
{"text":"Expect to wait to be seated but usually is faster than promised. Food comes out as its ready vs all at once. Good food. I do perfer boiling crab when it comes to the sausage"}
{"text":"Hot n Juicy is my all time favorite restaurant, i always go to their original restaurant by spring mountain. But this one in henderson didn't do them justice! Their crawfish are so tiny compared to the other 2 restaurants by spring mountain and they have a really bad service here too! They forgot to serve our rice, so we waited for almost 30 mins to order a new one, and the taste of their sauces was just not very good comparable to the other 2 Hot n Juicy restaurants in Vegas..."}
{"text":"After my friends seeing it on man vs. food and my friends convincing me to try it, I went to Hot N Juicy Crawfish. It is a really cool place with amazing food! The concept is really neat and different. They bring you a bag with a pound of whatever you choose (crawfish, shrimp, crab, etc) in whatever sauce you choose. I had the \"Hot N Juicy\" sauce with medium heat. It was delicious and the shrimp were cooked perfectly. The crab was also delicious and we tried it all in different sauces and they were all good. The crawfish was good but not very filling and take a lot of time to eat. The fried shrimp were actually one of the best things with a cornmeal batter. Overall i really enjoyedmy experience and I will definately be back and have been twice already. The only knock is the very long wait every time and the prices are a little expensive if you get anything exotic."}
{"text":"I'm a regular of Hot & Juicy and get it whenever I pass by. This is by far the best tasting location I have been to in Vegas! I will be coming back and location is very easy to find. Shrimp was very tasty coming out. Not heavy  on the garlic either. Keep being juicy!"}
{"text":"The good-shrimp/corn was good.  The bad-service, calamari was just horrible it was over cooked, we order appetizers  and they came with the dinner. They don't have a kids basket All and all, I would definitely choose angry crab.."}
{"text":"The overall experience was well-received. The waitress, Jessica, answered my questions and responded quickly to my requests. It was delightful to have such an amazing customer experience with her. The menu comes with the usual assorts of seafood creatures. I ended up with 2 lbs. of crawfish seasoned with Hot n' Juicy and extra spicy. It was good but I expected more of a kick. The Cajun spice was there but I didn't get the effect of volcano eruption from my mouth. I don't think the extra spicy even register on my Richter scale. If you're accustomed to Boiling Crab and comparing it to here, I would say Boiling Crab is spicier. The decor is quite different as well where Hot n' Juicy resembles an America bar and Boiling Crab looks like you got into a shipwreck. I will revisit this place and recommend it to anyone who has an appetite for Cajun seafood.  TL,DR: Good customer service, flavorful but not spicy, ambiance is more modern, recommended for seafood lovers."}
{"text":"Great if you're craving Hot n Juicy, but not feeling up for the trek to the Chinatown area or dealing with long wait times. This place is much more open and spacious than the other two Vegas locations.  However, I find the service here to be 'meh'. Adequate, but not very attentive or anticipating of customers' needs. Had to ask for gloves, cracking utensils, lemons, etc. Prefer the location on Spring Mountain, closest to Decatur. Service is more prompt, upbeat, and friendly at that location."}
{"text":"First thing first, the customer service is awesome (my favorite waitress is Arine [not sure if I spell it right]). However, the toilet here when I visited it is dirty and has poop sticking on the bowl, pee over the place. But generally, the food is great."}
{"text":"This place is one of my all time favorites. I eat so much the food gives me heartburn, ulcers, smelly hands and dirty clothes but I still come back for more like an addict. The étouffée is what sets this place apart from The Boiling Crab. The place is to legit to quit!!!"}
{"text":"The service was fast and the shrimp was great. I've been to both locations and this one is the best. Not in the greatest location but so worth it. I've called and picked up to go also and it's quick and easy"}
{"text":"And now sadly down to 2 stars. I'll likely not come back either.   We came in this evening to get my king crab leg fix, and for $26 we were given two whole legs. TWO!!!! $13 a leg, basically. Such crap. The shrimp we ordered was a better value for the money, however half the shrimp was mushy and there were a lot of heads without bodies in the bag.   Our server offered to let us talk to the manager, but the manager should have been brought over as soon as I complained the first time."}
{"text":"Very great customer service from Wanda L. And Eve hahaha my friend (b. spice) enjoyed his pre bday celebration haha recommend this place!!! :)"}
{"text":"Ate Here Awhile Back I Absolutely Loved It!!! Can't Wait To Go Back!! The Food Is Like No Other. So Happy My Sister Introduced Me To This Place. Definitely Recommend You Try It Out If You Are In The Area."}
{"text":"Amazing flavors just off the strip! We had to go back for more. Everything we ordered was delish both times. Wear the gloves because it can get messy.  Don't leave without trying the corn fritters. Shrimp and crawfish are amazingly fresh.  We loved the clams in garlic sauce too.  There are 2 locations just blocks from each other. I would recommend this location. Staff was super nice."}
{"text":"love this place! So flavorful and good prices, I recommend the shrimp and king crab legs whole shabang spices... medium you tell them how spicy you like it with a cold beer! ask for extra lemon and be sure to bring some plastic gloves because you will be eating only with your hands.. also recommend the seasoned fries! great for games and fights because they have plasma tv screens around the entire restaurant only down side is you get dirty."}
{"text":"ooooommmmggggg this place is a gift from god...food totally amazing. ..i didn't know what to put in my mouth everything taste so good and spicy"}
{"text":"Seafood boiled in a bag with spices and butter. Plastic bibs. Beer.  It is the ultimate finger food: barbaric level.  For those a bit on the 'daintier'side, they have plastic gloves for those with fresh manicures.  After having lightly feasting prior to this, my stomach found its second wind.  Upon entering, you're hit with the aroma of spices and seafood wafting from the dining room.  Make sure you get there with plenty of time to avoid waiting.  Greeted with a smile, we were seated quickly and handed menus.  After ordering some beers we quickly ordered.  Crabs, shrimp, crawfish, dungeness crab, mussels, corn, potatoes, rice.  I don't remember much during the meal as I was entranced with devouring all of the delicious goodie bags that decorated our table.  With the pile of napkins growing by the minute, we sat back and surveyed the land.  A truly fierce battle with everyone the winner.  *if you order dungeness crab, the trick is to pour rice into the shell to soak all of the crab fat for a decadent treat."}
{"text":"FOOD is GREAT!!! THAT'S IT....STAFF at this place needs to be more attentive and friendly...I'm glad they have take out..."}
{"text":"I love hot n juicy. But I'm going to stick to the locations on spring mountain because the service at this location SUCKS.   Our server was a Filipino guy and he was friendly and upbeat, but he seemed more interested in having conversations with his co workers behind the registers. He forgot our refills so after 15 mins we had to get another server's attention. And she forgot too!  Food was good, but the service at this location isn't the same like the other locations. The girls and guys at the spring mountain locations are always moving fast and friendly. Won't be coming here again."}
{"text":"New to Vegas, and I must say that it is a good substitute for Boiling Crab back home in CA.  Placed an order for pickup, service was fast and friendly.    Not as greasy as Boiling Crab, but just as good!  Maybe next time I'll eat in to get the whole experience."}
{"text":"Honestly, if I have never been to the Boiling Crab in San Jose this would have easily been a 5 star rating for me.  I just love the atmosphere of the whole place..from the garlic smell (that follows you through your clothing for the rest of your day by the way) to the get-down-and-dirty style.  Some things just taste better eating with your hands and this is one of those occasions.  Seating did not take very long and our server was very friendly and helpful.  He explained the system to us and forewarned us that even mild has a kick to it since it is a Cajun restaurant.  My lips were burning by the end of my meal with mild, so if you don't like spicy food, do not come here!  We ordered snow crab legs since the blue crab and the dungeness crab were out (that was upsetting).  We got it with the Hot n Juicy seasoning, which the server explained did not mean it was spicy, but was a combination of all the other sauces.  It comes in a plastic bag, so we put on our plastic bibs and dug in!  It was delicious...the crab was meaty and the seasoning was just right.  Just thinking about the taste right now makes my mouth water.  We also ordered the sweet potato fries.  Maybe you would have better luck, but if you want my honest advice, do not order those!  They were soggy and gross.  This is a must try if you have never experienced anything like this.  I would definitely come here again.  Do not wear nice clothes here if you plan to go clubbing afterwards, keep an open mind, and enjoy!"}
{"text":"BAGS AND BAGS OF CRUSTACEANS YES PLEASE!!!   We drove by this place and I'm like, \"Hey!  I think I read about this place on Yelp!\".  We waited for about 10 minutes on a Saturday night and then got a booth.    Our waitress was super helpful guiding us through the different flavors and the types of seafood.  We eventually settled on 2 pounds of crawfish and 0.5 pound of shrimp.  i think next time, 1 pound of shrimp, 1 pound crawfish and 1 pound of crab/lobster.  Crawfish heads had tons of flavor BUT paying per pound is working against you with crawfish because it's all shell....at least shrimps have thin shells!    Order with beer, order some bread to dip into the sauce.  Wear clothes that you don't like because you WILL STINK like garlic for days to come.  I saw one table with plastic gloves on which may be a good idea....but then I think you lose a bit of the experience if you use gloves.    Do GO!  This is a MUST DO OFF STRIP experience!!!!"}
{"text":"The seafood was very good, correctly cooked, and seasoned nicely.  We had the combo with crawfish, shrimp and sausage with corn and potato in the bag.  The seasoning was hot and juicy spicy.  We also ordered the fried catfish with cajun fries.  The crawfish was very good, but as usual with crawfish, you don't get much meat.  The shrimp was very meaty, however, and cooked just right.  I wouldn't order the crawfish again but would do the shrimp.  The sausage was a good addition, but nothing special.  The potatoes were perfect, but the corn was overdone and mushy.  The fried catfish was again cooked perfectly, but we are not fans of the cornmeal coating (although it was again well done).  The cajun fries were prepared nicely with a good crunch.  I probably wouldn't buy the hot and juicy the next time as a little drier would probably work just as well.  But then again, I was licking my fingers so it couldn't have been that bad as it tasted great.  1 lb. of shrimp is a lot of food and you should plan on sharing unless you are a really big eater.  We took the rest of the shrimp home and had it for lunch cold the next day.  It was still much better than you would find at any grocery store and the seasoning was still good.  The service was also very good.  If you are a seafood person, this is one place to go."}
{"text":"I came in on mother's day and there was a super long wait for food but our server, Caira was attentive, helpful, sweet, entertaining and when the food finally arrived it was all worth it!! delicious crawfish but what earned this 5-star review was the service!!!!"}
{"text":"One of the worst dining experiences I've had in Las Vegas.  Upon entering, the first thing you notice are the used paper towels littering the floors and coming out of the trash receptacles that haven't been emptied. My date, who'd been their before, said wait til you taste the food. Ooh la la. We sat down and ordered. I had mudbugs(crawfish) because I'd never had them before. They came with new potatoes and corn on the cob. The place just wasn't working it's magic(maybe mojo took the day off) and asked that the food be bagged so we could get out of their as soon as possible. I think I hurt my dates feelings, because she took a cab home. If I'd known how bad crawfish tasted I would have given her mine as well. So, on the way home I tried me a mudbug. It was awful. All they are are the brains(don't eat the green stuff) and a smidgen of meat in the tail. Not enough nutrition in a dozen to keep a bird alive. So, for almost $40 fazoles, I got a bagful off new taters and corn on the cobs.(And my dates bagfuls as well). When I got home I put the bugs in Ralph's dish(my bloodhound), and he came to the same conclusion I did. The End I wouldn't go back to this place even if they fed me for free. It deserves negative stars, but they're not available."}
{"text":"So, there was a bit of a wait and it was kind of expensive...overall I would have to say that it was still worth it!!!  The food was really good, the service was fast and friendly and you even get a bib! :)  I really enjoyed it and would recommend it to all my friends and family.  This place is simple, but awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Not sure why the low reviews...but, we have always had a great experience when dining here.  Food is on point.  Fresh, hot, and the waitresses are always helpful."}
{"text":"My first time here was last Saturday. The food was great, and the atmosphere was amazing. Our server greeted us right away. Unfortunately, our server was hard to track down for refills. There was another server who took our payment because we couldn't locate our server. Other than that, I would recommend this location."}
{"text":"I am excited that they opened a location in Henderson. It's not only closer to me, but parking is much easier than the ones on Spring Mtn.   The quality of food and sauces are still the same as the other locations. It's a little smaller than the second location but the wait wasn't too bad.   My husband and I shared a laugh that they installed two sinks outside the bathrooms just for hand washing, so you don't have to go inside the bathrooms unless you need to. :)  Overall, this new location is just as good as the others!"}
{"text":"Thanks to some recommendation from native LV Yelpers, We decided to visit Hot & Juicy for dinner on a recent trip to Las Vegas. Not the best idea to come straight from the convention centre, as the Hot & Juicy smell permeated our blazers and followed us around all week, but the experience itself was well worth it.   Anything that made it onto Man Vs Food is likely the opposite of what I am looking to eat, but we decided to give it a try, for the spectacle alone. As soon as we arrived, finger licking smacking, bib wearing ladies were queuing for the washroom  in need of a quick hand wash. Waitresses with big smiles and heavy eyeliner ran around with buckets and plastic gloves on their hands. I was intrigued.  The two of us sat at our plastic covered tables and ordered beer ($3 for import) 1lb of Crawfish medium Hot & Juicy special, 1 lb of shrimp medium Hot & Juicy special and 3lbs Crab Spicy lemon pepper. We also had 2 ear of corn, and an order of calamari whose accompanying fries never arrived.  It was a ridiculously too much amount fo food but we were starving after a long day on our feet.  Everything arrives in a plastic bag, with sauce puddling along the bottom. The waitress dumps the bag onto your table from her bucket, and will give you a brief demo if necessary. You are instructed to dig in and leave the carcasses in the middle of your table as you plow through.   Regarding the spice, I found medium wasn't enough and I regretted my decision. Also, I regretted ordering so much all at once, as we ate some got cold, which was less appetizing.  For the novelty (we barely ever see crawfish in Toronto) it was fun. Anything that dirty is always a good time of course. The flavor of the lemon pepper was really outstanding. It was great.  The service was actually among the best we got in Vegas, they were attentive and friendly.  $96 for a mammoth amount of food that could have fed 4 with about 3 beer each.  The crab was good, but I find the crawfish just doesn't give you enough meat.   Minus a star for the impact on the environment from all that waste. I would have been happy with bucket, no bags."}
{"text":"I came here with a large group of people, including one person who is a self professed Hot n Juicy addict. First off the service: our waitress Isabelle was AWESOME! In the face of crappy food from the kitchen she did a great job. On to the food: it was embarrassing how bad it was. I had the clams and they were way over steamed. I had also ordered corn and potatoes and the bag didn't have them. Other members of my group got ice cold potatoes. When we got the substitute potatoes those were cold too. My friend's shrimp was not just overcooked, it should have never been cooked at all! It was bad, like was probably spoiled. Just an over all bad food experience.  Like I said at the start, thank god for Isabelle."}
{"text":"OMG... This Place Is To Die For!!! Seriously. I learned about it on Man vs. Food & Adam you were soooo right!! The food here is AWESOME!! If you love seafood, this place is a must. Not only were the Crawfish tasty, but the crab was sinful too!! I waddled out of this place just because I could not stop myself. Now the place is a hole in the wall... nothing fancy here, but that's ok by me cause it's hard to be cute when your sucking the head off them there crawfish & crackin crab!! Really!! It's off the strip... about 1.5 miles from the Palms, but so worth the visit!!"}
{"text":"Always a hit-or-miss experience here. My boyfriend and I love seafood and coming here(most times), for the updated music, convenience, and cleanliness...but The staff act like they don't know what is going on when you bring up an error in the order, or check on the wait time after it has passed the previously quoted wait time they give you. Some servers are nice to check up on you frequently for refills, but others just bring the food and disappear, leaving us to flag down a server who wasn't ours to begin with. I always order the Cajun fries, and every time they have either too much seasoning or none at all, and when you ask for seasoning to be added the response I always get is  \"We are not allowed to give out our Cajun recipe.\" ??? I wasn't asking for your recipe I just want it on my fries.. *sigh"}
{"text":"I really enjoy eating here. It is just delicious. Our server Alexis B. was attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"We came here a couple days ago and it was great eats, great service and Juan was awesome. He welcomed us once we walked in. Gave us the option to sit at a table or booth. We chose the booth which was about a 5 min wait (he did tell us it would be a small wait). It was my first time there so he took me through the menu and explained all my questions. Thank you we will be back again."}
{"text":"I enjoy spicy foods, and this place meet my needs for spiciness. Eating Crawfish is messy but damn it's so good."}
{"text":"Ate Hot nJuicy last night for the first time. Went with the whole fam-bam. Nine deep and a high chair.  None of us were familiar with the differences in crab. The wait staff was very helpful guiding us through our menu selections.  The food is delicious and the options for seasoning and spice are right on. The only bummer was paying 44$ for one Dungeness crab. It was tasty, though.  Overall a great experience and will be back. Hopefully soon!"}
{"text":"THis place is awesome, a little pricey but its more than fair for what you are eating.  The sauces run a little spicey so I get the mild or baby spice, but thats just me!   Service is friendly and food comes out fast and perfect."}
{"text":"Almost as good as the vegas location, but I was a bit annoyed by the service and location. Other than that the food was great!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat seafood loved it, but beware their spicy Is spicy! My friends had a hard time with mild"}
{"text":"Just taking my own personal time writing this review about Hot N Juicy makes me want to drive over there right now and get a pound of shrimp. This place is king in terms of asian/creole style crawfish/shrimp/prawns. I think the shrimp is the better than the crawfish. The hot n juicy special sauce- spicy-  is the best tasting style imo. Id recommend requesting the potatoes and putting them inside the bag. The only negative things id say about this place is that dinner can be very messy and that your hands will smell, sometimes days after you eat. Crab legs are above average, corn is sweet, and prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh!! This place was hands down amazing!!!! We came here for the first time tonight and this will be a stop for us from now on every time we visit vegas! Our server Andrea and Selina were great! They suggested the snow crap legs which were to die for!! We liked it so much we ordered a second pound! We got the hot and juicy mix medium.  Our server Andrea suggested medium because it gets spicy as you keep eating. Her suggestion was spot on! Thank you Andrea! We ended up ordering 2 pounds of snow crab and 1 pound of shrimp!  So good! Both servers were very nice and attentive! Great place to visit! You will be hooked!!"}
{"text":"I most like to eat small crawfish, and feel good, and just think is not very enjoyable well, it is not strong,, but not bad, can eat here to such a crawfish is also very lucky,,,,,,,!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I always order the same thing hnj mild, but yesterday I had this awesome server , Katya , she recommended that I try lemon pepper with my shrimp nd oh my god! I loved it. It was soo delicious and the server was soo sweet and friendly , it made my day! Definitely gonna go back for more :)"}
{"text":"four days after the visit and i'm still sweating garlic!!  not just great crawfish, but also king crab legs, snow crab, and oysters.  yum yum yum!  i'd go back to vegas just to go here.....and to take a hit at the blackjack table :)"}
{"text":"The hot juicy in Tempe have plenty of great reviews but when we went our waiter Billy ignored us and myra the manager came to assist us she was very helpful and noticed that we weren't being properly served, its weird how they charge you by the pound for lobster  but half of its unedible, so you pretty much spent $33 for a lobster tail and also the shrimp is not deveined!, that is probably why they are so popular in Vegas and other places where alcohol is prevalent because people do not notice what they are eating!"}
{"text":"I love this place. My favorite go to for shrimp and crab legs. I love the different seasonings. I'm always pleased and full when I leave."}
{"text":"Service was horrendous!  First off, kids were running around and playing hide and seek behind our chairs, but kids are kids...chalked it up to parents not paying attention...  Our food was thrown at us... Ranch dressing fell all over the table and floor. No one cleaned it up. We planned on continuing to order but our server was an eye roller and totally rude. The gal cleaning the restroom was huffy too! It seems as though everyone at this location must hate their job. We finished what we ordered, paid and were shorted on our change.   The OTHER location is much better. I'll never come to this one again."}
{"text":"All I can say is that this place is sooooo bomb! My bf and I always eat here. We usually get the shrimp or crawfish with the Hot & juicy sauce, which is so garlicky. lol Then we overload it with lemon. OMG pretty bomb. It does get a little messy so I usually don't recommend getting all dolled up to eat here. Can't really say anything bad about this place. Well just the fact that it gets crowded but it's understandable 'cause it's hella good here! Also, it's kinna hard to find parking sometimes.  In my opinion, this place is better than Boiling Crab."}
{"text":"Really poor service and then treated exceptionally poor on top of it.  Shame.  Two people finished 30 mins before everyone else.  Three others were still waiting for food one hour after the first person was served.  First told it was \"the way we serve food' then was told it was the rush then was told it was harder to serve this many people, lastly it was \"the fryer is backed up\"."}
{"text":"Highly Recommend This Place  Ask 4 Shea She Was Great  Best Services Ever! Definitely Returning Soon"}
{"text":"Love hot and juicy! If you're into seafood and spicy, you'll love this place too. You don't have to order spicy, as their spice level has different ranges. You get bibs and eat with your hands. Service is great. Best Cajun fries I ever had :-)  prices are great too. The server Gem is sweet!"}
{"text":"OK its 3 days since I ate here and I can still smell garlic on my fingers! This place was one of the best parts of my Vegas trip. The complainers about this place can only complain about waiting. I would wait an hour or more no problem! The service was outstanding. When they dumped those bags of seafood on the table without utensils or plates, I knew it would be good. We ordered the crawfish hot n juicy style but mild and the garlic shrimp. Both were great but the crawfish are alot of work for a little meat so my favorite was peeling the shrimp and dipping it in the hot n juicy sauce from the crawfish. MMMMMMM! I can still taste em. I will go here every trip to Vegas from here on out! We went on a weekday and had no wait at all but it was busy."}
{"text":"On 5/3/2015, Food was good but not great. Be prepared for a mess. Service was not very good. Had 8 people, got there early bit they would not seat us until half our group was there. Then we waited while they moved tables around to accommodate us. Went across the way from HNJ,and ordered a beer while we waited for our group to show. I guess they don't need the revenue. One couple ordered corn which hadn't arrived 45 minutes later. Requested corn from multiple people with no luck. After husband got testy, the corn was finally delivered......at end of meal. Want this type of seafood, try Joe's Crab Shack."}
{"text":"I looked forward to eating at this place for two years, after seeing it on TV. It was good, but doesn't hold a candle to my regular spots in Texas. To be fair I didn't try every spice and flavor level.  I was really disappointed that they didn't have blue crabs when we were there.  Shrimp were good and the crawfish were overpriced, but that may just be Vegas.  All in all, I'm glad I can say I finally went, but probably will not return."}
{"text":"I recently went for a weekend trip to Vegas and this is one of the places we stopped at for lunch. One of the best meals I have had in a long time!  My friend and I shared an order of fried calamari and of chicken wings (with their Cajun fries!) as an appetizer and both were delicious! The fried calamari is by far the best I have ever had and just going back for that would be completely worth it. The meal didn't stop there though!   I ordered a pound of shrimp with the hot n juicy seasoning and it was out of this world good. I love shrimp and here they were big and juicy and perfectly seasoned! I also got to try some of my friend's crawfish (also with the hot n juicy seasoning) and that was marvelous.   I liked this place because the food was delicious, the staff was friendly, and the restaurant itself was clean. I am absolutely coming back here during my next Vegas trip!"}
{"text":"Fast service, yummy flavored crawfish and king crab legs. Our waiter was very nice. Will come back."}
{"text":"My friend and I went to Hot and Juicy for lunch yesterday and shared a bag of shrimp, an order of sweet potato fries, and an order of corn fritters. Plenty of delicious food to share! The only thing I felt that could have helped the meal was a great sauce for the sweet potato fries- they were served with ketchup, which was ok, but could have been better. The corn fritters were delicious, the shrimp- \"over the top\" and the service was perfect!!!! Aubree was our server and she was so attentive and friendly! We can't wait to come back and hope to get served by Aubree again!"}
{"text":"3-stars for food, 2 for service. I am a sucker for crawfish and was overall pleased with the taste quality, especially for a chain (and seafood in AZ). I don't recall the price but it was pretty reasonable.   The service itself was very slow. Our waitress seemed more concerned with flirting with the group of men than checking on us every now and again. Also, the fountain soda was super flat and when my guest told her she wanted a different drink, it took her a good 15 minutes to return with it.   I am going to knock on the hostess, who I told upon entry I am meeting people and I know where they're seated. She decided it would be important to add she thought they were \"in the corner booth.\" It was a group of Asian women I don't know and that certainly was not the party I was meeting. Honey, it's 2015- don't assume two Asians in a room MUST know each other."}
{"text":"Food was good. Very good. Service was friendly and helpful. Only reason it not a 5 in the music was real loud. i ask to have it turned down and its was but right after that a really loud and annoying trap/dub step song came on. The song was very distracting and it felt like I was at a rave. Over all Good."}
{"text":"Love this place. Come here at least once a week. The waiters and waitresses always have a smile on the faces and accommodate guests professionally."}
{"text":"Great crawfish, best in Phoenix! Great service too, felt welcome as soon as we entered. Ashley (waitress) was amazing! Will definitely be going back!!"}
{"text":"Waited for almost 2 hours after they said 45 mins. Then when we sat down we waited for like 20 mins ..... Waited and nothing so we just left! Waste of out night !!!"}
{"text":"Came here twice and both experiences were not so good.   First time trying it out, our order we continuously being messed up.  Second time, our rice was not throughly cooked.    Customer service is not the best, there ate a few workers who actually know how to be genuinely kind.  They are also quite forgetful, so get there attention if what you asked for has not been brought out in 10 minutes!!    I gave three stars due to the shrimp I had that was \"okay,\" and the bathrooms are nice."}
{"text":"We really wanted to try this place because my friend works here and we love boiling crab type crawfish joints!:D   This is actually my first time getting my hands down and dirty with the seafood because usually I'm too  ::ughhh I don't wanna smell::  ::ewww its gonna get under my nails and all over my hands:: Yeah... I'm a shame... but I finally decided that I'll get over my prissy self to enjoy some damn good crustaceans hahha  I love shrimp! Get the Hot n juicy special!! It's a mix of all their seasonings (juicy cajun, lemon pepper and garlic butter) and its soooo yummy!! I am a wimp and cannot for the life of me take spicy, so the server suggested I try it without spice and yummm it was sooo good!!! My bf is the total opposite and loves spice, so when he got the hot n juicy crawfish at spicy, he said it wasn't spicy enough -.-;;;; he is a fatass and got 4lbs of crawfish and was totally enjoying every last bit of it. a little too excited.... We all shared a dozen oysters... mmmm it was a relief and cool break from the spiciness of the crawfishes for my  friends.  My friends got the crawfish too but in medium  hot n juicy. They are big boiling crab fans and said that there was a certain zing to their seasoning that BC doesn't but didn't want to love it more because of how far it is from us (we live in orange county). They also got the fried catfish basket. The catfish was breaded a little too much, and didn't taste as fresh as the rest of our meal.   I got the soft shell crab basket on top of my shrimp and that was really good. The cajun fries that came with it weren't as impressive but were made better by the leftover Hot n Juicy sauce that I had. Hehehe  All in all, we had a good experience, our waitress was really cool (katherine, kaitlyn?? I don't remember....) pretty attentive, but we had to nudge her for water sometimes.   We'll probably be back, considering the long list of places we need to try in vegas in our short weekend stays."}
{"text":"The meal was ok. The service left a lot to be desired. I had to wait almost 40 minutes for my meal after it was ordered. We had a party of 9 and instead of bringing all the food together it came in stages. If you were the last one to get your plate everyone else was watching you eat because they had got their food already and we're done eating by the time you when the last person finally got their food. The service is definitely not worth the money you spend for the food."}
{"text":"This place is an experience.  The shrimp and crawfish (order by the pound) come in these plastic bags that are filled with sauce.  Sometimes your sides will come in the bags as well (sausage, or corn on the cob).  You can experiment with different sauce combos.  You get to wear a bib and gloves so you don't get dirty, but you will somehow manage to get sauce on your pants or something.  It's a pretty novel concept.  Service here is excellent!  They'll teach you how to eat crawfish and are very happy in general"}
{"text":"Hot N Juicy!  And it's exactly that - HOT & JUICY!   My party ordered almost about everything on their simple menu, and I made sure to mooch off everyone.  Everything was fresh and...well...HOT & JUICY!  The crawfish, the shrimpies, snow crab...etc - everything was delicious. You can even order a styrofoam bowl of rice on the side if you wish.   I compared it to Crab Hut back in SD, and I hate to admit it - the hot n juicy seasoning beats crab hut buy an extra thumbs up.  I'll definitely be back for this one.  Bib up and enjoy your finger lickin meal!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that Hot and Juicy is one of my local fav's...  I recently stopped in for a quick 1lbs. bag 'o shrimp, which I get with the \"hot and juicy, \"medium\" sauce'. For some reason it tasted different than it usually does, with a faint, bitter aftertaste and not the usual, \"smack you in the face\" garlic punch.   It took a little while to realize that they had substituted the fresh garlic for the cheap bottled chopped garlic stuff that barely resembles garlic!!!! It was totally depressing that a restaurant that seems to be busy from the moment they open to the moment they close would need the sacrifice that distinct garlicky goodness for a bitter sulfur flavored imitation.....  I hope they wise up and switch back soon!"}
{"text":"First timer at this place after hearing so much. My husband loved and I was impressed but not blown away. The hot and juicy seasoning was very delicious but I think next time I will try the lemon pepper. The shrimp didn't really absorb the flavoring as well as the crawfish did. I will definitely return. Service was excellent, especially Jessica! She was attentive, personable and more than made up for the slacking of some of the others. Its too bad they pool tips because obviously others are riding on the backs of others (Angela)."}
{"text":"The corn is the bomb.....I always get the crab legs.....hot and juicy flavor ....oh my!!!!!!! If u have not went you need to go."}
{"text":"You can feast or go light with a Shrimp,  Soft Shell Crab or Catfish Basket.  Very friendly staff of lovelies working the Joint!!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place but it did not live up to my expectations. The concept is intriguing but the deliver sucked. The food was expensive and I felt like my bag of seafood was skimpy. The roll of paper towels was already dirty when we sat down and we had to wait 20 minutes to get our check. I won't be back. There are better seafood places around town. Crawfish just isn't for the faint of heart (yuck)."}
{"text":"We had a big group so we got to try the clams, snow crab, crawfish, shrimp, sausage, corn and potatoes.  We did the Hot and Juicy sauce in medium on the crawfish, shrimp, sausage, corn and potatoes. We did the garlic on the clams and butter on the snow crab.  Everyone's favorite was the crawfish and sausage but we still ate everything so you can't go wrong with anything we ordered.  Service was great and the beer was cold."}
{"text":"I am not a huge fan of seafood (aside from fish), but I decided to try this place out. There was a wait time, but shorter then the estimated wait time given for a party of two. They take your phone number (cell), and that's how they inform you that your table is ready; which is a great ideal, so you can walk around the area while you wait.  Once seated, a menu with short selections are given to you. If you have never eaten here before, the waitress/waiter will explain how the menu works (selections) I.e. what comes with what.  We decided on two pounds of crawfish, and a pound of shrimp. The seasoning we opted for was the hot n juicy special which is a combination of all of their seasonings. The spice level, we opted for was spicy. Never eaten crawfish before, we had to YouTube on how to eat it, lets just say it was an experience! The shrimp, I didn't realize it was going to be the whole shrimp Lol, but I had better luck figuring out how to eat it!. I recommend dipping the \"meat\" in the juices the seafood is cooked in.  They offer a bib, I would advise putting it on, as things could get messy really quick. The Margarita I ordered was really salty, meaning salt was at the bottom of my cup as well as the rim, which really was a thumbs down considering I never requested salt at all.  Will I be back to eat here again, probably not, as the food was okay. The service we received from our waiter & waitress was great!!   #ilovegoodfood"}
{"text":"The food here is really great but BEWARE someone from hot n juicy is stealing credit card information. They took my credit card informationand I tried to reach the manager 3 times and it's been about 1 month. USE CASH ONLY!!!!"}
{"text":"We had been to the Hot'n'juicy in Orlando and decided to give it a try in Las Vegas. We got there and there were about 20 people outside waiting for tables. The hostess took out named down and told us we might have a 25 minute wait. We hung out by the old school barber shop next door. In about 15 mind the hostess called our names and we were ushered to our table. We had the corn fritters, pound of lemon garlic shrimp, pound of hot'n'juicy crawfish, a pound of Louisiana mussels and a pound of snow crab legs. The corn fritters were fresh, juicy and just melted in your mouth. The shrimp was succulent and simply out of the world. The crawfish had a good flavor but they were not the best I've had. The waitress told us that they were out if fresh crawfish and only had them frozen and we got half price. The snow crab was meaty and was slightly on the saltier side.  For the portions and the price, this place is well worth it. There is a gelato bar 2 doors down and if you feel the burn, have the watermelon gelato."}
{"text":"Went here in late October with my mother and grandmother.  Parking was a bit scarce, and the place crowded, but we were seated quite quickly.  Tables were simple and covered with wax paper, which is expected since eating crawfish tends to get messy (they do give you bibs, but you shouldn't go in wearing your best and most expensive clothes).  We ordered two pounds of crawfish and an order of fried catfish.  Prices of the shellfish are market value, so you have to ask the wait staff (when we went, the price of crawfish was approximately $10 per pound.)  You then choose the type of seasoning you want for your crawfish and how spicy you want it.  We went with the Hot N Juicy special seasoning and Hot heat level, which was very delicious.  The Catfish was decent, but nothing special.  When you come here, stick with the shellfish.    I recommend this place.  Be sure to get here early, as it isn't a big place and fills fast, and expect it to be messy and fun!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time on a Friday night.  We went to the location further west but there is also one closer to the freeway. I assume they are the same.  It was packed but worth the wait. We ordered shrimp, lobster, snow crab, sweet potato fries, corn and rounds of beer. We ordered everything medium and hot n juicy. The food was great and really messy. It was a fun experience and will go here again. Just be prepared for the food to stare back at you since they leave the heads on!  Also don't plan on leaving without food all over and juice squirting you in the face."}
{"text":"It's always a fun food experience at Hot N Juicy Crawfish! The flavors and seasonings have all been too spicy for most of my friends and family (even the mild one, unfortunately), so the 'hot' in \"Hot N Juicy\" shouldn't be taken lightly. And although I'm a huge crawfish fan, I do recommend the shrimps more than the crawfish because the shrimps are meatier, easier-to-peel and are an overall better bang for the buck. Make sure to order sausage slices too because those are amazing in the bag with the seafood!  Don't wear anything too nice and don't plan on going anywhere where people will judge you on your guaranteed garlic scent! (Also, one of the waiters spill the bag of crawfish on my husband, so keep your distance when they bring the food to your table...)  In terms of locations, the one that's closer to the strip is newer and less busy, so I recommend that over the original location!"}
{"text":"I would've given it zero stars but that wasn't a choice. I've dined at this location many times but I have never received this kind of horrible service. Danielle our server which her name tag mentioned she was a lead server which I can not believe she gave us the worst service. First off she sat us with no menus I had to get up and get them from the next table, second we waited 5-10mins after getting our food for a servers attention to tell them our order was incorrect and all Danielle did was nod and rolled her eyes so we assumed our new order was going to come out yet it never did and yet we ended up being charged for it. Their was 2 servers on the floor Danielle and Reme no server ever came by to check on us but yet they went to every other table. We work in the restaurant industry and I would never treat a paying guest this way. Next time a friend of mine mentions on dining at Hot & Juicy I will let them know that their hard earned money should be spent somewhere else!!"}
{"text":"Came here during our Vegas trip, saw good reviews on yelp so we decided that we have to try it. The crawfish and the shrimp were fresh but the sauces were just ok.   Both the garlic butter sauce and the house special sauce had way too much garlic on them (my breath smell like garlic for more than 2 days).  The fried cat fish and the soft shell crab weren't that good either, we had better one before.  I think the crawdaddy in San Jose and boiling crab in Orange county have much better food than here."}
{"text":"We love this place every time we come here food it's always amazing. I strongly recommend this place , you won't regret it"}
{"text":"Yum!!!! This place is awesome! I do prefer boiling crab, but this place is still tasty! Be warned: Their medium level of spice is very, very hot!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I fell in love with this place the moment I sat down and realized I had to peel my own shrimp (head and all) and throw my trash right onto the plastic tablecloth. After several trips, I've come to learn my favorite flavors and spice ratings. I love the hot n juicy special at a mild or medium level. These levels have a good amount of spice that doesn't hurt my face.  Now, I'm not a very good spicy food eater. But I have been here with different groups of friends and have had the opportunity to sample the different spice levels. I can say the extra spicy is very very hot, and it builds with every bite you take. Your lips continue to burn, but you can't resist the tastiness and continue to eat, despite the pain. But what I really like and appreciate about the extra spicy flavors is the fact that you can still taste the flavor despite the heat. Your mouth isn't reduced to just a ball of fire.  And on that note, I would recommend any seafood lover to visit this fine establishment."}
{"text":"Seafood cooked in a bag of the juicy goodness of your choice. I've been here so many times, I don't know why I haven't written a review. It may be because everyone knows this place and it's already popular...  But here is basically what you need to know: -you, and everything else you bring into the restaurant (purse, clothes, shoes, etc), will REEK of garlic for several days following. But it's all worth it. -you can/will get dirty. There's a reason why they cover the tables with plastic and paper. You deconstruct your food and throw the remains right on the table. They do provide bibs and plastic gloves upon request. -seafood remains intact, heads and all. So if you're squeamish about seeing the head still attached to your shrimp friend, then you probably shouldn't eat here. -there are 2 locations: both on Spring Mountain, one near Decatur and the other near Valley View.  And one more thing: I will go out on a limb and say it. I prefer Hot N Juicy Crawfish over Boiling Crab. The Hot N Juicy special vs Boiling Crab's version...I just like the flavors better."}
{"text":"Just the best! Yum scrum. Ask for Gem she's a doll! Love this place so glad there is one in Henderson."}
{"text":"What can I say! I LOVE THIS PLACE BEST Service, waitresses and  seafood. It's delicious!!"}
{"text":"Usually perfect but this one time is the reason for the 1 start, food poisoning. I have been sh****** water for the past day and sweating impulsively. Sorry but it's not worth it!"}
{"text":"Just like the name, it's hot and it's juicy. expect a wait during dinner hour. Staffs are friendly. Place is fun in a way."}
{"text":"Visited here for the first time this weekend.  it was my first time eating crawfish, was definitely a good time.  It is sort of gimmicky, but fun.  I wouldn't do it every week but every once in a while is fun.  Like others have said, be prepared to get down and dirty.  I"}
{"text":"I was SOOOO DISAPPOINTED in this place, I'd thought I write a review. Was there last week and almost walked out on Hot n Juicy. Worst service ever, nothing compared to the first time we've been there. Honestly, the first time we were there late last year food was awesome (almost as good as BC)  Was there for a late late lunch and we were all starving. I recommended this spot to my fellow travelers and said it's worth the wait and just as good as BC. Waited for about 1 hour and this is a late late lunch around 2-3pm. Got seated and waiter took our order. He confirmed the order and everything was correct. Food came 15 min later. Sauce taste so watered-down, no flavor what so ever. Nothing like the first time we were there. Not only that our friend had ordered 2 lbs of king crab legs. 1 with their special sauce and 1 just steamed (plain.) Everybody got their food except for the steam crab legs. We kept reminding them that we still have not received it and it's been about 20 mins. 5 min later, still nothing. Told another waitress/waiter to check on it. Again, 5 mins later, still nothing. It's been 45 mins and still nothing. Everybody is done eating and one of us still have not gotten plain crab legs. WTH!!! So again, we ask if they have forgotten our order and they said No, it's on order. Told us crab legs takes an average of 25 mins to steam, but yet we got the first lb with sauce and everything in 15 min. Why does it take longer for plain crab legs? Everybody is completely done now and we still did not get the crab legs. We ask what was going on and they said, again we are doing everything we can to fulfill orders and it's very busy and for us to just hang in there. Nobody else was waiting to get seated. There were empty tables and people who came in after us was already finishing up their food. WTH!!! So we ask for the manager and the jerk in charge said with a smile \"there's no manager available right now\" and walked away. We saw the waiter ask him what was going on with their order and he threw his hands in the air, said \"i dunno\" and walked away. Obviously somebody was in charge at the time. WTH!!! And their apology to us was that they will not charge us gratuity since we were not happy. OMG!!! I can't believe this place even made it on the Travel Channel now. We paid for our food even after the way they treated us. Not only that, as I was walking to the restroom to wash my hands, the girl in charge was on the phone with the owner and was explaining to him how it happened and if he hears anything about it... that's what really happened. WTH!!! That did it!!! That was the last call!!! Never ever going there again and never going to recommend it to anybody else. Horrible!!!"}
{"text":"Super yummy and messy! Not a place for a first date or important meeting. You will get messy. I ordered 1 pound of mild crawfish, king crab, shrimp all with the hot n juicy sauce. It was perfect for 2 adults. But if you dont like spicy let me warn you..mild is pretty spicy. Overall if your craving cajun spices and seafood this is the place to go."}
{"text":"This was a cute little crawfish place to eat at the prices seem reasonable and the po' boys  we ordered were very tasty. The only reason they get three stars is because they were out of everything except frozen crawfish, not cool."}
{"text":"My friends really like this place. I guess I just don't like crawfish. Or the sound of people eating and spitting them. The whole scene totally grossed me out. But like I said everyone I was with ate and enjoyed. I think they should expand the menu a bit and offer non-fried selections to friends of people who like crawfish slurping. :)"}
{"text":"Very good!!! Loved their seasoning and the waiters were awesome and attentive.  Would definitely come back when I'm in Vegas"}
{"text":"I can't believe we ate so much. First time here and will definitely come back!  You order by the pound and everything comes in their own bag of juices. Plastic utensils and no plates and paper towel rolls.  Can't be ashamed of leaving carcasses on the table.  Reasonable prices.   Don't bring your friends that can't handle seeing the heads of seafood. Although my favorite part someone at another table couldn't handle it and their whole party left cause of him. Such a shame.   They do have chicken fingers for the non-seafood eaters.  We ordered Calamari Raw oysters Shrimp mild with hot and juicy sauce Shrimp mild with garlic butter Lobster with garlic butter Crawfish medium hot and spicy Fried Catfish Sweet potatoe fries  Everything was incredible. Oysters were good but nothing special. Wish I didn't order rice as that's what put me over the top but couldn't help it I'm Chinese and the sauce over rice is oh so good!  Import beers for $3 - Domestic $2. Just Beer - no wine or alcohol.  Wish they had at least wine as not so filling as beer.  Restaurant closer to Valley View is much larger and not as busy.  Parking can be difficult as there's a bunch of other popular restaurants sharing the same parking lot."}
{"text":"This taste so much better than Boiling Crab. This place has lots of tables and lots of space. Good enough to get down and dirty with your shrimp and crawfish!"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating here. It did live up to its name. It was delicious! Hotter then a mofo mind you. If you aren't a lover of the spice I would recommend staying away from spicy Hot&Juicy sauce. It's awesome just lava hot. Lol.  It was a great experience all around. Service was kick ass! Helpful, polite, friendly, very knowledgeable about all the food. Me & mine will be back again.   Lava Hot.... You've been warned. Lol....."}
{"text":"Great seafood! 1st time I came here it was great, great service great atmosphere. 2nd time the waitress seemed to have forgot about us. We asked for ketchup and never got it, drinks weren't refilled once and finally we had to flag down another waitress to get our bill. That's the only reason I deducted a star.  Oh and parking is HORRIBLE! I recommend parking on the street and walking a little, the parking lot is small, packed and cars going in and out. Seems like your car would get hit."}
{"text":"I am updating my review from the last time, added another star because customers service improved. On a weekday the place was pretty steady, the server were working as a team as well as the manager all of them went to our table to ask how we were. Water is constantly being filled. Food is pretty good, piping hot as a matter of fact that means it just came out fresh from the cooking pot.  Ordered shrimps, clams and crabs legs, beer. For two people that's a lot of food. We did not left any shrimp unpeeled. That's how good it was. Over all food and customer service -two thumbs up and so glad we gave it another try. Equals = we will be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"This place is just average! One thing I really hate is when the shrimp isn't fresh and or you overcook it! Crawfish was nothing special. Service     Was non existent. I will not be returning!"}
{"text":"Shorter wait.. Good food but Very Poor Costumer Service! Literally! If you guys wants to eat at HnJ Crawfish, i suggest to just go to the other location less than a mile from here! Food is the same but Customer Service is wayyyyyy different! Longer wait but worth it! This HnJ location has shorter wait but after they get your order, it will take 1 1/2 hours for it to come! Asked 3 staff but they just keep saying \"ok\"... Really?  and oh! Where's the butter? Isn't that a very simple request? Where's my water? How come we only have 3 pcs of gloves? We actually have 4 hands in total?  Goodness! We're done eating already.. Nvm!  Our vegas trip was kinda ruin because of this!"}
{"text":"OYSTERS,  SHRIMP,  and DUNGENESS CRAB!  Oh my!  Lol!  Another must stop while in Vegas.  There's either this place (that has other locations) or Boiling Crab...but we like it here better.  You order your seafood, pick your sauce, spice level, sides (if you want)...then get MESSY!  Soooo good!  I always get the shrimp with the spicy hot & juicy sauce.  Mmmm!  I also get an order of oysters.  I gotta have that cold clean oyster feel while eating spicy stuff.  And also because I just LOVE oysters.  =)  Rice is a must for me, oh and a side of extra sauce with lotttts of lemon.  I'm so hungry now.  Lol!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. I'm from Louisiana, and honestly this is the closest thing to southern seafood in Las Vegas. The service is always a bit slow, but nothing unbearable. We ordered 3lbs shrimp, one had to be sent back because they were cooked too long and wouldn't peel & we ordered a 2lb lobster. Shrimp were very good, seasoning excellent, but the lobster severely lacked in flavor. Also had to wait 5 minutes after the lobster was delivered to receive the cracker tool to eat the lobster. Cajun calamari is good, small portion though. Overall, I would go back, just not waste money on the lobster & also expect a wait to be greeted and place order."}
{"text":"I've had Louisiana Crawfish, so I knew what I was looking for.   Love the flavor, but the cajun mud bugs were on the small side.  Crab legs were nice."}
{"text":"Great experience. Our waitress, Alexis, was extremely helpful and nice. Even though we were missing a pound of snow crab (which are absolutely delicious!), Alexis was super nice and fixed the mistake . The sauce are just top-notch! Eating here is a great experience and will be again!"}
{"text":"FINALLY! I popped my Hot N Juicy cherry!   Found this place on Yelp, and ready many many a review. I decided this was the perfect place to take my southern husband for a surprise birthday dinner, and it turned out to be a BIG HIT!   I took Yelper advice and we arrived early on Friday night at about 6:15 pm and we were seated right away. This place is pretty no-frills with the table settings, decor and furnishings, but after eating our meal I now see why!   We took MORE Yelper advice started with 1 lb of shrimp and 1 lb of Crawfish with only the Hot N Juicy seasoning, nothing extra, a side order of sweet potato fries and a couple of frosty adult beverages. The food came out fairly quickly in plastic bags (Like I said, no frills!). Bib in place, we dug in and were very impressed with the flavor, freshness, and the fact that the seafood was cooked to perfection. Not overdone! After round one, we decided on more frosty beverages and another pound of shrimp and 1 lb of snow crab. The snow crab was awesome (except my small injury due to my own stupidity and the fact I was talking instead of paying attention to my crab cracking. BTW Hot N Juicy sauce in an open wound is no bueno)!   Our total bill came to about $70 before tip which I felt was fair for the amount of food we ate and the quality of the seafood. It was about the same price we would have paid for beers and AYCE Sushi at our fave place, and I was equally happy and full and buzzed :)-   Advice: *Arrive early to avoid a wait (we were there at around 6 and were seated immediately, when we left the wait was about 45 minutes), *Wear the bib, don't come dressed to the nine's *Come hungry *Leave your small kids at home because your hands and forearms will be covered with \"juice\" and I can't imagine trying to eat and care for an antsy little one  Will we be back? You bet! And next time with a crowd of friends who we know will LOVE this place!"}
{"text":"The food was great. We had the raw oysters and they were juicy. We ordered King crab legs, potatoes and corn on the cob. The seasoning was on point and not too spicy. We are here for a week and will be going back. The price was decent. I'm a believer that you get what you pay for. I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"This place is the real deal. Im from New Orleans currently living in Colorado so I complain about seafood whenever I get the chance. Saw Hot n Juicy on Man Vs. Food and wanted to try it. The crawfish are cooked perfectly and did in fact taste as though they were flown in from Louisiana every morning. I asked the server which part but he didn't know.       The spices I tried were the traditional Louisiana and the Hot n Juicy special, both with medium spice. They were both excellent. The traditional is very similar to the crawfish boils I use to have in the backyard with my family. I initially got two pounds but then got another two pounds after that. At 10 bucks a pound, be prepared to spend about $60.00 for two people.      We also tried the sausage and sweet potatoe fries, again both were great. The fries were made to order and the sausage was very flavorful. My only complaint is that the potato that the comes with the crawfish (if you order two pounds) is very plain. It tasted like they boiled it by itself and then just threw it in with the crawfish. But anyone from New Orleans knows that the potatoes must be boiled with the crawfish and have the potential to be the most flavorful piece of food in the boil. My wife was also disappointed with the corn on the cob that was included, she stated that it tasted like it was just a cheap frozen corn. Im definitely going to revisit when I goto Las Vegas again."}
{"text":"We had a great dinner at the new Eastern location! We had an amazing server Aubree who had a spunky and upbeat personality! We ordered the peel shrimp and she assisted us by personally showing us the best way to do so. Fun and delicious experience. Definitely recommend and ask for Aubree!!!!!"}
{"text":"Food was yummy but the service was so so. Our appetizer arrived after our entree and having asked about it twice."}
{"text":"Excellent!!! Fast service, hot food! Lemonade is the best waitress! Heidi is also awesome! Worth every dime!"}
{"text":"best seafood restaurant i have ever been to in my life! best service i have been treated with in my life! took my girlfriend who doesn't care for seafood and even she said she has to come back to Vegas even if it was just to eat here!  whoever is the waiter with the tattoos and piercing on his face and stretchers in his ears, despite his appearance, should be promoted asap because i have never met a person so well mannered and fun to talk to while at a sit down restaurant!  thanks to him I'm coming here every time in Vegas! i even tipped him 25% of the check he did so well!"}
{"text":"If you like seafood and know how to peel and crack it this place is great! The food can get very spicy, great environment and smells. The service was a little slow but it was very busy when I attended there. Make sure to wear your bib and gloves!"}
{"text":"I ordered to-go and the service on the phone and upon pick up was amazing! I got corn and shrimp with Hot N Juicy special. I found the sauce to be a bit sweet unlike previous times I had gone. I still ate all the food but I've liked there sauce better on previous visits."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate lunch here this past weekend while visiting Las Vegas for her birthday. I remember seeing this restaurant years ago while watching an episode of Man vs Food. This place is just awesome!! My wife and I ordered the crawfish and shrimp both with the hot and juicy seasoning with the extra hot spice. Some of the best seafood we have had. We got one pound of the crawfish and two and a half pounds of shrimp with two drinks and our bill was only $42.00. If you are ever in Vegas grab a taxi or Uber and visit this joint you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I'll start my first ever yelp review with this location not due to food the food was great. The cause of this review was due to the horrible service from the front of the house. The customer service rendered was terrible and sadly I recommend our party to eat here due to the West Hollywood location in Santa Monica being my favorite place to eat.   Our party of 6 arrived and were greeted by Jasmine the team leader/ hostess who kept up with ETAs until being seated her customer service and the great food is what saved this from becoming a 1 star review.  The wait was approximately 15 minutes.  After being seated our server arrived who never introduced herself to take our drinks orders. Within a minute another server arrived to take our drink orders again for some unsure reason and insisted on taking it again until our first server arrived and delivered drinks.  We ordered our food all 1 pound of shrimp hot and juicy with sides fries and rice. And this is where our dinner spirals into mediocrity. Everyones fries and rice arrived and all but one of our bags of shrimp arrived. We informed our server 3rd or 4th of the night who brought the food who we later found out was the manager Eve Rodriguez that we have a bag of shrimp missing and requested refills. I assumed he acknowledged our complaint with direct eye contact and a nod. When our 2nd server passed we then informed her of our bag of shrimp was missing and requested a refill. Our party began eating so all our food was not cold. Throughout the meal our waiter? waitress? Waitresses? never arrived once to check up on our table. After 30 minutes our group physically went up to our server to remind them of our missing bag of shrimp and for water if they couldnt refill drinks. Our water eventually arrived after 5 minutes. And 15 minutes a total of 45 minutes after our last bag of shrimp arrived after our group was finished eating. Once again a refill was requested heard then ignored. After our last member finished after 30 minutes. We spoke to the last apologetic employee Jasmine who aplogized for the experience but not much could be done.   My friend then spoke to Eve Rodriguez the manager tall hispanic man with a pony tail and informed him our terrible experience. Maybe since it was Vegas or maybe they get complaints constantly he stated he will take 15% off our 3rd parties check as soon as we mentioned one of our party members received his food 45 minutes late and attempted to walk away.  My friend was upset about the unapologetic attitude and disintrested attitude by Eve and threatened to not pay. That seemed to upset Eve which is understandable and he then threatened the whole group threatening to call Security and press charges when 2 groups of our 3 groups already paid which was not ok. After that he finally listened to our complaints compes our 3rd party meal 25%. While exiting another group informed us they have been waiting 2 hours for part of their parties food.   Its odd this occured there were consistently 3 tables open and there was a large party that took 3 tables 20 minutes after us.   Front of the house definitely needs work."}
{"text":"This is my first time coming here and now I wonder why I've never been here.   I came with a friend and she and I had a pound of shrimp and crawfish both mild and original hot n juicy seasoning. It was soo good and a like spicy but that was pretty spicy for a mild. I definitely will be coming back to try the Dungeness crab and king crab legs.   The only reason I gave them a 3 star was bc our server wasn't the best. I'm used to having great service, which also makes the experience great and invites you to come back again. When taking our drink order she didn't even let my friend finish before taking off. When she came back to take our order, she seemed more interested looking somewhere else than paying attention. All in all she seemed rushed to take off and it wasn't even busy at all. Slow down and take your time lady."}
{"text":"We finally tried Hot N Juicy last week. We went to the newer location, which is also closer to the strip (Spring Mtn/Valley View vs. Decatur), and slightly less crowded. We were treating my husband's cousin to her birthday dinner. It was her pick, she's been before and enjoys it. She ordered a pound of snow crab (hot & spicy, mild) Dungeness crab is seasonal, supposedly it was in season, but they were out, so we got a pound of snow crab + corn (garlic butter, extra spicy) and crawfish (hot & juicy special, extra spicy).   It was my first time eating crawfish whole, I love the tails, but it's so not worth the work or price. $9.99/lb and not even 1/4lb was edible. The snow crab wasn't meaty at all. It made us long for San Francisco or NOLA for that matter. We also had cajun and sweet potato fries. I usually love sweet potato fries but these were limp and bland. We did like the cajun fries they were the spiciest thing we ate. Service was bad. It was a bad beat. $70 later, we were still hungry. Worse yet, our clothes stunk to high heavens afterwards, and the following day we could not get enough to drink. Holy sodium, Batman."}
{"text":"Only eat crawfish and oysters with a month with an \"R\" in it and when you get your \"R\" go here!  Went here completely on a yelp review and glad I did.  Grab the crawfish and don't wear your best white shirt cuz you'll be rubbing your hair in the Hot n Juicy sauce b4 you're done.  They got it down and are expanding watch this one explode!!!!"}
{"text":"Food was soooo average. Me & my sister decided to share the drooler and ordered an extra 1/2 lbs of snow crab legs. Uhmmmm first time experiencing crawfish and I would never order them again. Meatless. Our first server was OK, seemed like she was forced to smile....her friend or whatever she was that decided to help her was a total b****. Unfortunately we saw more of the friend than our actual server. Friend had a horrible attitude. Like other reviewers said everything came out at different times. When she delivered us our plastic bag she didn't bring a bucket or utensils for the crab or the gloves or anything else. When we asked her for them she gave us a dirty look and acted like we had just asked for her to strip her clothes off. I see in other reviews that the manager is just as bad as he/she's servers...hopefully corporate does something about that ASAP. Place has some potential hopefully you fire your whole crew and start fresh. I've been in the food industry for basically my whole life being my parents have owned numerous restaurants and I haven't ever in my life experienced such s*** service before. I've served for most of my life and I love love love to make peoples experiences unforgettable IN A GOOD WAY. Don't understand why you'd keep such a horrible staff around when you are getting this many bad reviews on them. Oh & btw food makes you feel like a** after a couple hours. So all around a s**** show."}
{"text":"The freshest seafood in the desert. Plenty of bang for your buck. The staff was super."}
{"text":"Am a big fan of a shrimp boil, but this place brought it to a new level.  We ordered shrimp and crawfish--loved them both. As far as flavoring we like Hot and Juicy which is a mix of all the flavors. Wouldalso  recommend adding the sausage to either for a few dollars extra. Also the sweet potato fries are great.  Went for lunch and got right in, but we were there when they opened."}
{"text":"As always, you can't go wrong with the food. It's delicious!   The staff though? Really bad customer service. I give them an F. Waitresses are not friendly and courteous AT ALL. Took a while before acknowledging us. No one even said \"thank you\" and goodbye when we left. Mind you, they didn't even know we were upset so we can't say we were rude customers. I was super hungry when we came after 2pm. When we finally got our food, they served the wrong one! No apologies whatsoever. I ordered extra Hot n Juicy sauce and as courtesy, they should have at least known to comp $1.75 for the wrong order, as a simple courtesy.   To the  manager, please train your staff to be friendlier and more pleasant. They give your resto a bad name. Thank you."}
{"text":"Yelp is almost always spot on, especially if there are a lot of ratings.  This place is another example.  The crawfish and shrimp were spicy and delicious.  I had about 12 diet cokes in the process of finishing the pound of crawfish and shrimp.  Get the rolls to dip the sauce.  No better way to enjoy the spicy juices other than to use the rolls as sponges."}
{"text":"These places are always fun to eat at. And the food is always good. Tonight was no exception when it came to quality of food and fun. But the service in this place is horrible!!!  How long does it take to boil shrimp!  Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"Crawfish and catfish po'boy were both pretty bland.  Not sure what the theme of this place is.  Tables setup like a dive joint in New Orleans which is cool but then stuff on the wall is tourist crap and dance music playing. Not a good mix.    Service also not good.  My server was poor never refilling my water and takin forever to bring me my check, observed another server who had no idea how to make a martini that someone else ordered, and other servers siting and talking in back while people in front waited to be seated."}
{"text":"Rebecca and Karol where excellent in introducing us to the experience! Fun, messy, and exciting! Great sauces!"}
{"text":"**Confession: The seafood @ this spot is absolutely amazing!!!!!**  Of course a pescetarian like myself is always in the mood for yummy seafood. A few weeks ago, my sis recommended that me & a friend check this place out for din din. OMG, I fell head over heels in love!   It's always a good sign when you walk up to a place & there are people lined up outside the door, waiting to be seated. There was also a large number of people who placed to-go orders, so this place was jumping with business! We decided to grab a bottle of wine (Fetzer Riesling) while waiting for our table and all of the staff there were really friendly & funny. I was joking with the guy who gave us the wine before we even had a chance to sit down. LOL  It was Friday night, so like us, most of the folks dining there were already pretty tipsy (as they rightfully should be). Wheee! :-D I remember joking around with a female waitress who was serving a table full of guys about them having another round of drinks! I also interacted with our adorable server before we were seated & decided I wanted to sit in his section. I let the hostess know & she was completely cool with it. All of the fun, goofy interaction with the staff was the 2nd indicator that we were in a good location.  Finally, the food. You select your seasoning, pick a spice level, & select your items. We opted for the Hot N Juicy Special (combo of Louisiana style, cajun, garlic butter, & lemon pepper), Extra Spicy (Hot Hot Hot!!!), & ordered crawfish, shrimp, lobster, & crab (hooray 4 seafood!). The crawfish comes with 1 head of corn on the cob & a red potato, so you can add additional corn & potatoes to your order as needed. All of the food comes marinated in clear plastic bags, so you literally open up the bags and dig in! Everything was seasoned & marinated to perfection! It was hot, spicy, juicy, & delicious as advertised. The service was also impeccable from the moment we stepped into the place! It was one of the server's last night there so we ended up taking silly pics in her memory since she was working instead of enjoying a moving away party. I think I ended up taking pictures with the entire staff by the time the night was done. Silly me! LMAO   We ordered shrimp, crawfish, corn, & potatoes to go for my sis since she wasn't able to make it down there with us that evening. Those leftovers were still delicious the following day. :-) I was back in Vegas this past weekend (the place was packed again on Sunday night) & ordered takeout for dinner one evening because the food is absolutely fantastic! Looking forward to eating my leftovers tonight & making plans to visit some of the other locations soon.  Be sure to check this place out next time you're in town. You're sure to love it as much as I do! :-D"}
{"text":"This place was really good, but I personally like The Boiling Crab better. BTW- you might burp up what you ate within a few hours... Yuk!"}
{"text":"I have to say food-5 stars service-stars ambience-5stars This place was packed tonight and we got seated within 10 mins. We sat at the bar and one of the managers came and asked if we want a drink. We chatted with her and asked her name, Kat. She told us we can't eat at the bar but she promised us a table in 2 mins. And she kept that promise! The bar was full, she got all our drinks asap. We had 3 Bahama Mamas and t was sooooo delicious! We got seated right away after drinks were made! Jace was our server he was awesome very attentive and was pretty energetic! Our last experience was horrible with the service being slow and food coming out slow. But tonight, you guys gained regulars! Thanks for the great service Jace and great drinks to Kat!!"}
{"text":"Me and my wife drove here from Grand Canyon so you can only imagine how hungry we were, I mean... it is a 4 hr drive!  We got in and the nice waitress sat us to our seat immediately. So far so good. She took us our drink orders and after a few minutes we decided what crazy combination of seafood porn do we wanna shove into our empty bellies.  We settled on:  1lb of shrimp 1lb of black mussels 1lb of crawfish(frozen) 1lb of snow crab legs 2 pieces of corn 2 pieces of potato  ... all of this smothered on a medium level hot n juicy sauce, with a side of cajun fries.  Food came out fast, seafood first then came the fries. Cajun fries were fresh to order, crispy on the outside and just the right salted seasoning you would expect. Pro-tip: Skip the ketchup and use your seafood seasoning for the fries, you won't regret it.  Onto the main show. Medium level spicy is definitely spicy! I love habaneros and jalapeños and I though after a few pieces of shrimp, I was starting to feel the fire. The only problem is that it's good you eat through the pain until the only pain you feel is how full your stomach will be.  If you ever had boiling crab, I would say the hot n juicy sauce is very similar to the shabang sauce but it's a little sweeter. I really prefer it to the shabang sauce at boiling crab... it's a shame san jose doesn't have a hot n juicy location...  Overall, great food, great service...oh and the price was great too!   If you're ever in Vegas or in LA, I highly recommend coming here for a meal if you love seafood, cajun boil, and both of them together. You will not regret it."}
{"text":"We saw an episode of Man vs Food for this place just before our Vegas trip, so we brought the hubby here for Father's day.  This location had the Man vs. Food banner  so we knew we were in the right place.  We had to circle to get a parking spot.  It was 90 degrees outside, but comfy inside.  We were able to snag one of the last tables. The other tables had families with kids, couples, and friends. The wait staff was all young and friendly.  We ordered a pound of shrimp in garlic sauce and a pound in the hot n juicy special sauce, mild for both.  They were nice size shrimp.  The flavor of the sauce was great and the shrimp tasted fresh.  The tables were covered with plastic and they had plastic gloves for us.   A big roll of papertowels was on the table.  It was messy.  The shrimp comes tied up in a plastic bag.  The kids got chicken nuggets and fried shrimp with fries, which came in a little basket and they were okay.  We didn't like the etoufee with rice that we ordered.  The flavor wasn't what we were use to, but the texture and rice seemed normal.   My family doesn't like the shrimp heads, so lucky me, I got them all.  I didn't eat them all, but I ate quite a few.  I didn't feel well afterwards, maybe it was the shrimp heads.  Hubby and kids were fine.  I normally have a pretty iron stomach, so I would try it again."}
{"text":"I was motivated to go here because I saw it featured on the Food Network, and I was hoping it could hold a candle to the Boiling Crab.  While to seafood was pretty good, it wasn't as spicy & flavorful as I had hoped for.  Go early as it tends to get crowded.  We went at 11am on a weekend and by the time we finished our meal, there was a line for tables."}
{"text":"I love seafood and this place definitely has fresh seasonal seafood from blue crab, crawfish, clams, lobster, oyster, and shrimp. Since this place is usually packed, it's recommended that you call ahead for reservations.   The staff and service is very helpful in recommendations and attentiveness. They will refill your glasses of water when they get a chance, get more napkins whenever they come to your table with more orders, and make sure you order enough before the kitchen is closed.   The set up is simple: order seafood by the pound. You can choose the seasoning for your seafood (like Louisiana Style, Juicy Cajun, Garlic Butter, Lemon Pepper, Hot N Juicy Special) as well as the spice level. Then, the food is served in clear plastic bags and all you need to do is rip it open and dig in. You can make a mess on the table and not worry about the clean up. It's messy, it's fun, and it's delicious.   Besides seafood, you could order sides like their Cajun fries or rolls to soak up the flavorful broth or sauce that is used to cook the seafood.   Fast, fun, and filling, Hot N Juicy Crawfish is the best place for people who want a feast of fresh seafood without the worry of cooking or cleaning up."}
{"text":"OK... so I watched the Man VS Food show and saw this place... And I wanted to eat here.. AND I DID!!! Went during 4th of July weekend... We had to wait 45mins!!! BUT was well worth it!!! Crawfish was yummy and shrimp was  yummy!! Next time I go there I will try the Crabs!!! MMM"}
{"text":"Hot N Juicy is pretty good. I had a pound of shrimp with the Hot N Juicy special sauce (which I guess is a combo of all the sauce flavors). The shrimp was slightly overcooked which made them hard to peel, but the flavor of the sauce was excellent!  I'm from Cali and I am a big fan of The Boiling Crab so the sauce is up there with Boiling Crab's whole shabang. My one complaint about the sauce would be that it was too watery/thin and it didn't stick to the shrimp very well.  I also had the cajun fries and it wasn't my favorite as I've had better elsewhere.  I hear they are opening a Boiling Crab out here in Vegas but until then, I'll probably be back if I ever have a craving."}
{"text":"If anyone knows a thing or two about Louisiana style crawfish, they know that Hot n' Juicy is the best crawfish restaurant in Vegas. The main thing that makes crawfish worth eating is the crawfish itself; hot n juicy is known for having the freshest crawfish being that we are away from the shore. Why is it important to be fresh? Because the meat is extra tender! Even when crawfish is out of season, they serve crawfish that is fresh frozen and it taste pretty decent. The next important thing about good crawfish is the sauce!!!!!! Hot N' Juicy is known for their over usage of garlic, but that's what makes it so tasty! Just make sure you don't wear anything or bring anything unless you want it to smell like garlic because the smell with stay on you for days!"}
{"text":"Glad they opened up a spot closer to where we live but taste-wise it's still is in second place to the original Chinatown location which is why I can only give it 4 stars. The service and ambiance are all pretty similar to their other locations. Also, they rarely have blue crab now, which I get is seasonal, but even in season they never have seem to have it on a regular basis. Too bad too because blue crab and the extra-spicy hot and juicy sauce is the best thing on the menu."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!!!!   Oysters are so delicious and sweet.   The best and cheapest in the las vegas valley.    crawfish were delicious, but don't order it too hot as the spice overwhelms the delicate crawfish meat.  Mild still gives a good kick.    The shrimp are cooked with the heads which makes the plump shrimp meat so delicious and moist.    A helpful tip is to get there before 5:30pm on friday and saturday, otherwise you will be waiting for a while to get seated."}
{"text":"After eating at both locations, the location near Decatur is much tastier, more flavorful, but it is smaller so the wait may be a little longer. However, this location is larger, it seems louder, but the food is not done as well as the original location."}
{"text":"When I ate there,  I went by myself so I wouldn't be distracted but the waitresses were so darn cute,  THAT totally went up in smoke after a few beers! I believe to really enjoy it,  you have to order at least 1 beer.  I ordered a Heineken myself.  I decided on raw clams to start.  It came on a plate of ice w some lemons. Nice presentation, I thought. It was surprisingly, fresh, good and FULFILLING. Strongly recommend it."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! The food was delicious and the service was great. Hats off to our server Brooke. We will be back tomorrow."}
{"text":"Yum!  The food was awesome and messy.    We had crawfish,  boiled shrimp with 2 different seasonings, snow crab,  soft shell crab, fried shrimp, corn fritters, cajun fries and mozzarella sticks.  Everything was really good.  It was my first time trying crawfish and I was shocked at how good they were.  The shrimp was so good and really big.    We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed so much last year, so we went back there last week. What happened? The sauce was so watery & blend and not delicious at all. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. The waitress was amazing and warned me abiut the way the shrimp is prepared ahead if time. Im glad she did. Im not huge on seafood looking alive on my plate.  But once I got use to it I actually enjoyed it. I dined with co workers which made my first experience even better.  Juicy is a understatment. Should call this place wet n wild. Food and sauces were perfectly matched. Definitely coming back with a bigger bibb"}
{"text":"This place is way better than Boiling Crab. Their sauces are much better and their seafood is very fresh! We got excellent service and were constantly paid attention to! The manager was also very nice and attentive by asking how everything was and did we like the food! I would only change two things which is why I rated this place 4 stars instead of 5:   First, we had to listen to music that wasn't really that bad for adults (I guess) but if we had our children there, it would have been bad. Other people had small children dining with them and songs like \"Bubble Butt\" and \"Pass that *ss\" just isn't appropriate for children. Secondly, please brew your own iced tea instead of using the raspberry tea from the soda fountain. Places like Wendy's, Panda Express and Rubio's all brew fresh iced tea and they are considered quick serve restaurants not full casual dining like you guys. But other than that, we loved our meal and were very happy. We will be back again!"}
{"text":"this place is delish! decent price. good service"}
{"text":"Thats my fav place to go and kill my stomach :) pound of shrimps in a lemon/pepper  medium spicy, ask for corn inside the bag, sweet potato fries and blue moon....thats all you need for amazing day! its 4 of 5 stars, cause restrooms (which you def need before and after meal) most of the times are dirty, they could keep it more clean, keep eye on toilet paper and towels... its always messy."}
{"text":"Went to HnJ near Decataur for lunch on May29, 2014.  Coming from Hawaii, we don't get to visit as often as we would like, plus there are so many other eateries in LV that we like to try.  We last ate at this location maybe two years ago - they didn't have fresh dunganess crab or crawfish at that time, so we hadn't gone back since, but after trying the fare at other 'crab' restaurants and not being 'thrilled', we decided it was time to go back to HnJ (we've only been to this location on two previous visits and have never tried the other location down the road in central C-Town). I guess you can say that my wife and I are crab people - we love to eat good shellfish and don't mind getting 'up to our elbows' while digging-in, shelling, peeling and devouring good/fresh crab or lobster and now fresh crawfish.  We lucked out on this visit - they had fresh live dunganess crab and crawfish.  So in our excitement with this good news, we ordered one dunganess crab (approx. 1.5#); one pound of snow crab (legs cluster); one pound of crawfish; and one pound of clams - all this prepared in their own 'Hot n Juicy' sauce, medium hot.  Add to that two potatoes and two corn and one bowl of rice.  Talk about plenty of food for two people!?  Our server was Joie - all the servers carry some type of 'walkie-talkie' equipment and can call the kitchen to weigh the individual dunganess crab and let you know right there how heavy your crab is, because everything is sold by the pound.  Joie was super helpful; not only in answering our questions and taking our order, but throughout the entire meal - she would continuously come by our table to see how we were doing and if we needed any more drinks or whatever. Wife ordered a coke and I ordered a beer - they were at our table in a jiff which was great since the outside temp was in the high nineties.  In good time, they brought each order out in double plastic bags - steaming and super hot.  This was my first experience at eating fresh crawfish and after this, I don't think that I can go back to any of that frozen stuff - totally different in texture and taste.  I would definitely order that again.  My wife kept on commenting how everything was so fresh, meaty and tasty, even the snow crab was solid and sweet.  As you probably have read in earlier reviews, there are no dishes or eating utensils, other than those plier-type crab-crackers and plastic shuckers.  Also, they provide plastic bibs and gloves, but if you don't like eating with your hands and getting crab juice on your arms and face, this may not be for you.  Definitely not a 'prom date' restaurant, but they provide plenty of paper towels and handi-wipes to address this messy, barbaric and fun experience. For us on this visit the food was definitely five stars. But I must add, what made the experience here even more super was the positive atmosphere and overall vibe in this restaurant.  There was another female server and one male server - and I can't help but observe people when I'm out dining.  They both were like our server Joie - super polite (not condescending), always cheery, helping out each other and trying their best to make your HnJ meal a great experience - great food and great service.  We've been to too many restaurants where you have one and not the other; and for us on this day HnJ was tops."}
{"text":"First time I had H&J was in Vegas and it was really good. I actually prefer it than Boiling Crab but then when they opened one up in Arizona one in tempe later in Glendale. I had horrible experience in both restaurants. Tempe is just hard to find parking, very long wait and food was salty. In Glendale about the same, even though west gate is a big place it can get quite pack and hard to find parking. Usually the wait is 20-30 min but sometimes can take up to an hour. My first exp at H&J in Glendale,AZ was pretty good, shrimp was on point and so was the crab but then my 2nd visit they were missing 2 orders, I ended up cancelling it. On my third visit, the waiters always forget to refill my water and my orders came in extremely late when they were about to close again I ended up cancelling it. 3rd visit same experience and on my last visit again kitchen was supposedly backed up and they didn't bring out my snow crabs. The worst part of it all  the my garlic butter shrimp was extremely dry, the meat inside felt so hard, the shells were crispy and overcooked. I had to speak to a manager and all they said was were backed up. Do yourself a favor go to Angry Crab, nice people, no to a little wait and better food. If you don't mind traveling a bit far."}
{"text":"Food is great, service needs improvement. Seems as though we switched waiters twice. I had to ask twice to get a water refill after my cup was empty for awhile. A friend asked for unsweetened tea and got sweet. Waitress poured water into a friends alcoholic drink by mistake. She also spilt some of a beer. Each thing individually isn't significant but when you put it all together with no exceptional stand outs it adds up. It took a long time to get our checks and then another 15 minutes to split it them up appropriately (understandable party of 10) but even after a long wait we had 4 wrong items on our tab (we only had 3 things and no drinks). Then we additionally had to wait much longer to pay our check. Overall the food here is great but it really needs some tightening up."}
{"text":"Our Fav Lobster place - but please check your receipt, prices stated per pound was not what was on receipt to the tune of 0 overcharge - manager corrected."}
{"text":"This is the best seafood restaurant. The extra spicy hot n juicy special sauce is bomb, add a blue moon with that, to balance the heat. I love it."}
{"text":"Every time we can to Vegas it's a must. The sauce is  unique and delicious. The crab and corn is sweet and scrumptious. Warning mild is truly HOT!!!"}
{"text":"Finger licking good. 2 beers, 1lb of Crawfish, 1lb of Mussels, 1lb sausage, and etouffe. $41. Excellent service and \"we should consider coming back before we leave at the end of the week\" style food. Everything is served in plastic bags, you get bibs and gloves, so don't wear your Sunday best. A very good casual hit-the-spot dinner. Will go back."}
{"text":"LOVE this place.  we always come here for the crawfish fix... good thing they have \"to go\" orders, we dont have to wait for a long time to be seated. hard to find parking though. and yes, you smell of garlic for 24 hours. to go orders are ready in 10 minutes so that's a plus"}
{"text":"I've tried the boiling crab in San Jose ca, but this place is much better (Man vs. Food discovery) the favors are balanced and the staff is very friendly but keep reminding them if your missing an order. It gets busy on their hands. I like to order a corn on the side with melted butter, that way I could dip my shrimp or crawfish into it (satisfying my craves)"}
{"text":"Hot N Juicy Crawfish is the BEST!!! Love it, Crave it often! I get 2 pounds of Crawfish ( house way-mild lots of lemons and s/p), rice, and a cold beer. I go every time I'm in Vegas. Gloves are a must if I'm planning on playing Pai Gaw."}
{"text":"One of our favorite Vegas traditions is to get lunch at hot n juicy.  Its so good and the atmosphere is fun. Crab legs, 1lb of shrimp and an ice cold beer is the perfect meal. One bad thing is you do smell like your seasoning for a few hours after even if you do use gloves."}
{"text":"I dont if it's because I'm tired of boiling crab or something but this place and their hot n juicy flavoring kick boiling crab's whole shabang's ass!!! It wasn't too oily or salty and their spice definitely has more kick. I was sniffling on a mild haha... I tried the shrimp, king crab legs, and lobster  tail and all were pretty bomb! MMMMmmmMMMM"}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday yesterday, i was not impressed AT ALL.The staff at the Spring Mtn locations are more personable and perky than these ppl, i just didnt get the awesome vibe that i usually get at the othr locations"}
{"text":"Always awesome but the benefit of this location is it is far enough from the strip to keep the weekenders away."}
{"text":"David took over our first waiter that took our order in beginning it was close to closing time and saw him multi tasking covering other people's needs including our table best service ever better experience than boiling crab will be back to this location"}
{"text":"Food was great but the service really wasn't all that great. Food came out before waiter brought us our drinks, didn't give us any gloves, just wasn't very attentive."}
{"text":"My sister and I lived in Louisiana for a good portion of our teen years. Crawfish was a must and every Easter, our huge family would get together to feast on crawfish, potatoes and corn! When this came to AZ, I was very hesitant but my sister decided to try it. She LOVED it! Finally, after a couple months, my AZ family got together to celebrate Father's Day and it brought back so many memories. A simple thank you!"}
{"text":"Excellent spicy crawfish! Served in a bag with a Cajun sauce! Had to eat it with my hands, and enjoyed it thoroughly!"}
{"text":"Amazing seafood. Very flavorful. Service was good. Expect to get messy. Food is served in plastic bags."}
{"text":"Very great experience if you like the seafood with good seasoning go for this. You could ask for sampler if you are not sure!  I tried shrimp , clams fresh crawfish and green Mussels. Also I tried Cajun, garlic butter and paper and lemon seasoning.  Between all shrimp was great as always with medium spicy level comes with garlic butter. I always ask for a side of sauce just bc at first it hard to dip the meat in sauce in the bag. They charge for it but it all worthed . Also, don't forget to try the corn in the sauce . It is very well butters and seasoned. If you are so hungry go for bowl of rice. It is perfect match with any seafood and sauce. There is a waiting time on weekends and might be a little crowded.  Enjoy"}
{"text":"Came to Vegas for hot n juicy.. No more crawfish really..? WTF.."}
{"text":"This place is good, servers are always friendly,  and food is always served fast, I come here at least once a week and will continue to come"}
{"text":"Went here again and food was great!!! Also the waiting time to get food has much improved!!! Thanks again"}
{"text":"Today I can  from Denver! I had a server I think his name was randy! He was fast and very attentive. The food food tastes so fresh! I recommend the hot n juicy medium it was the perfect seasoning and spice! Did I not mention the chicken wings? It was small but amazing taste! I recommend coming to this location!"}
{"text":"I have tried twice now to go here for lunch.  The 2nd time in particular was bad customer  service. Very rude when I showed up at 11:55am.  Will not be trying a 3rd time."}
{"text":"We ordered 2 lbs of the crawfish & 1 lb of the snow crab legs all in the medium cajun sauce.  This came with 1 corn on the cob and 1 potato so we ordered 1 more cob and potato.  The food was sooooooooooooooo good.  That cajun sauce was excellent!  Especially when biting into the corn on the cob.  My mouth got all tingly from the spices and the flavor was amazing.  We got medium and my lips still burned!  I think I want to go back and try the spicy!  =D  Definitely wear the bib!  We got the food everywhere.  Especially since we were noobs at this, we got crawfish on our faces and on each other in the beginning.  Excellent place to eat!  I will definitely come back for some next time in Vegas.  Thanks yelpers!  =)"}
{"text":"OMG!! this place is a MUST MUST MUST. Featured on Man v. Food. I was never a big seafood person till I ate here.  crawfish, shrimp, oyster, crab in lemon pepper medium heat"}
{"text":"One of our \"go to\" restaurants in Vegas .. snow crab with lemon pepper medium with sausage is our fav .."}
{"text":"I love this place! A few people have mentioned they saw this place on Man vs Food, that's what happened to us too. Saw it, then decided to check it out while we were in town. A no-frill place outside & inside, plastic sheets on the table with a roll of paper towel. They serve mainly seafood (shrimp, crawfish, crab legs, fried fish, etc). Your seafood comes with your choice of seasoning, which also comes with your choice of spiciness levels. I picked the Hot & Juicy Special seasoning in mild, which it still had a bit of a bite to it, with a robust garlic flavor. I loved it.  Your seafood is delivered to your table in a plastic bag, and if you order any potato or corn on the side, they come in the same bag too, along with the seafood & seasonings. My husband ordered the fried catfish basket and he said they were good. No utensils, just you, your plastic bibs and your hands. So it does get quite messy. I ordered  pound each of crawfish, shrimp & crab legs. Just get down to cracking with my food & a few bottles of beer made for a nice, relaxed lunch while on vacation.   The staff were nice & friendly. Since we were first-timers the girl who seated us explained the different seasonings & spice levels. She was very responsive, replenishing our drinks & clearing up items as we finish.   Not cheap, but seafood usually isn't. I thought the market prices were fair. This will definitely become my Vegas spot to re-visit next time I come in town."}
{"text":"This is the best place ever. I love this place!!!! The food is amazing, the service is incredible!! I would come back here anytime!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent. The different sauces had good flavor, but beware of how spicy it can be. I love hot food, but the mild was too hot for me, I was sweating and nose dripping from the heat. I would suggest moving 1 hot level down to be safe. Be prepared to use your hands or plastic gloves over you hands to eat. There are no plates or silverware. Most of the food comes in plastic bags and you eat out of it on top of a clean plastic covered table. At $28 per pound of king crab legs and $184 for 3 people to eat, kind of cavemanish! But if your into the food and don't care how it's served or how to eat it then definitely try this place. King crab & soft shell crabs were excellent, shrimp & sausage was great, etouffee & crawfish was OK.  The food must be good because there is always a line to get in, but not sure if it was because their other restaurant down the street was closed due to some remodeling going on. The only cons for this place is I got mostly the top or body parts of the crab instead of the legs. Everyone else got legs. I mentioned this to the waiter and he didn't give a crap. Went there June 23, 2016."}
{"text":"Delicious food, messy but sooo worth it. They give you a bib and gloves that are totally necessary lol. Even the baby spice has a little kick to it so be careful about picking your level of spiciness. This time I had the garlic butter seasoning on the shrimp and it was great. This is one of those restaurants that you have to experience in Vegas."}
{"text":"This is my first time in this place. I've seen it a couple times. It's always packed and heard great thing on it. I went there Monday with my girlfriend and had an amazing time. Great fresh fish. A bottle of wine. Can't go wrong. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"They Bleed Garlic  We all have our flavor obsessions.  Some of us need lots of salt in a dish, while others tend to follow their sweet tooth.  For those of you who crave garlic, Hot N' Juicy Crawfish is your mecca, you should make your pilgrimage.    This place is all about one thing, and that is the food.  Generally speaking, you will not use plates or silverware here, just your hands.  The small paper menu features a few items, which can be ordered in a variety of styles.  Tables are topped with a roll of paper towels, and a garbage bag as a table cloth.  Normally I balk at the idea of wearing a gimmicky bib at a restaurant, but when your server brings you a bib, PUT IT ON.  This meal is a hot n' juicy mess.    Last night we had a pound of the king crab legs cooked \"Hot N' Juicy special\" style (think chinatown meets the bayou, or Mulan meets The Frog Princess if you're a Disney fanatic)  We also had a pound of crawfish the same way.    The King Crab Legs ($20 a lb. right now) were huge, meaty, and succulent.  The meat eagerly came out of the shell, as if it was waiting all day for me to eat it.   We also ordered a pound of the crawfish.  The only issue I had with these tiny dancers was that they're typically out of season this time of year.  The ones brought to the table were small, like the size of a medium shrimp.  They were tasty, but it is a lot of work for what amounts to a mento-sized morsel of meat.   Be ready to emanate garlic from your pores for a few hours after the meal, but its totally worth the aroma.  This is a great alternative date spot, since it is messy, casual, and reasonably priced.    Messy + Casual + Reasonably priced = Delicious Fun!"}
{"text":"If you like shellfish, and like to get your fingers messy, this is a fun place to eat. Shrimp, Crab, Lobster, Crawfish, Catfish, Oysters, and Cajun Sausage.  you order by the pound, and it's all served in plastic bag. you also receive a bib and plastic gloves are optional."}
{"text":"Food was decent. Service was terrible. This was my 2nd visit. Defienetely not the same experince. They got our food order wrong and didn't want to take it back. There goes 40 dollars down the drain. If you've been there, u know the routine. Crab decorated bibs and the option of gloves. Didn't get any of that. No refills on drinks until we asked for it. Theywerent even busy. No wait to get in so no excuse for bad service."}
{"text":"My first experience at Hot & Juicy Crawfish is one that does not make me want to come back on my next visit to Vegas.  It is not because of the mediocre food, it is because of the absolutely terrible service.  Your options are a couple of different types of sauce with your seafood or crawfish cook/boiled in plastic bags, then served on your plastic covered table and peeling your selections.  Half of the mussels and clams did not open but trying to get a server to discuss it, was next to impossible.  Maybe they were understaffed on that night but two of my colleagues ordered the lobster that took almost forty minutes at a cost of $50 each.  The highlight to me was the side of rice I ordered with some Hot and Juicy sauce on the side.  I don't want to sound cheap but after dropping a fair amount of money, being charges $2.00 for a side of sauce seems insulting."}
{"text":"This store call it crawfish. It's almost empty in the shell. The taste is like them has been frozen for over 1 year. Indeed what I got in the bag is almost craw, no fish. Totally disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"This is a must go!  If you have been to Vegas or live in Vegas you must go to Hot N Juicy Crawfish... go in the evening and anticipate a wait and slow service.  It is worth the wait and mediocre service to taste their crawfish, shrimp, lobster, or seasonal crab.  We also recommend the catfish basket, it is amazing !     My wife, family, friends, and anyone who comes to Vegas for a visit, we always take them here.  Everyone has had great things to say and recently I have noticed some new employees.  The service has been some what better but still has room to improve.  Either I have adjusted to their spice levels or they have reduced them, I don't think it is as spicy as it used to be.  Enjoy and let me know what you think."}
{"text":"I was in the area for a hockey game (Rangers vs. The Coyotes) Go Rangers!! My friend and I walked by Hot n Juicy Crawfish, and as I stared at the people eating on the outdoor patio, I begged my friend to eat there. She agreed!!  My friend ordered the shrimp in the hot n juicy sauce (which includes all of the seasoning - Louisiana style, garlic butter! Lemon pepper and juicy Cajun), she also ordered the crawfish in the Louisiana style seasoning . . . She enjoyed it. I ordered the snow crab legs and the shrimp, two corns in garlic butter . . . It was delicious and there were chunks of garlic in the bag of delicious sauce / goodness.  I gave this restaurant three stars because the service was a little slow and the server was fine just not very personable.  I would recommend this place if you are in the mood to eat some messy but delicious seafood in a very casual environment."}
{"text":"This is the best place for garlic saucy shrimp that i had taste since i been in vegas . In CA they have a place like this and i was so afraid i wouldn't find  a place like that here in vegas but i was wrong.   We order a pound of shrimp with all sauces mix , corn and a side of rice  It was so delicious and flavorful then with the sauce left we mixed it with our rice   Yes you will end up smelling like garlic and your hands too but for some one who loves garlic that is just a heavenly smell i am lucky my fiancé loves garlic too lol  I really recommend this place and i cant wait until i come back - we came here around 1pm and it wasn't crowd it at all.   They do have a thing on yelp where it says you call and dine on us -it isnt really specific but call and give it a try !   Dont come here wearing white because you will sure end up with some stains or just use your bib"}
{"text":"Okay... its already known that this place has sky rocketed through the roofs after Man vs. Food came here AND with friends constantly talking about Hot N Juicy! What's the next step?? Of course I had to bring my hungry ass to check this place out myself :)  Went along with my friends/RETURN customers yesterday (monday) haha and luckily there was no wait because apparently I've heard that they would have a 2 hr wait time...woah. Got seated to our table and I scanned the whole place out... it's actually nice inside. Not a fancy nice, but nice as in a chill laid back vibe. Being that it was my first time, I told the server what is \"normal\" for myself to \"CONSUME\" lol (food served in pounds). And she mentioned 1lb is normal for 1 person. She suggested the HOT N' JUICY SPECIAL, shrimp or crawfish. I picked shrimp. then there's a choice of how spicy you want it - Medium, Spicy, or Extra Spicy. Personally I love spicy food! I was thinking extra spicy! but then the server was saying that sometimes going extra spicy takes away the flavor of the food... and of course I didn't want THAT to happen haha.   Food arrives! got the napkins in place, my cup of water, and the infamous crawfish bib on.....now my game face starts! lol. Overall, the shrimp was definitely JUICY being soaked in with all the spice n' garlic! Spice level was perfect for me, although I should of tried the extra spicy too see how dangerous they seem to sound. Always next time.   BTW, I was not able to finish the lb. of shrimp I ordered since I had to peel the skin off one by one! I got full quicker because I ate slow!! FML! haha. This place is one spot you would want to come to if you need some livin la vida loca in your life!! haha"}
{"text":"Reminds me of my college years in New Orleans. Good food and friendly staff. Since my family don't like it super spicy I order side corn in the hot and juicy spice and use it as sauce over my rice. The package meals offer a good value as well."}
{"text":"Good food but terrible service! Most of the seats were empty on the day we ate here and yet the service was really slow. Asked 3 servers for butter and it took them forever to get it."}
{"text":"MY SO loves spicy food ( she's chinese ) and she is always taking me to chinatown to try various places serving spicy fare...after hearing about hot n juicy i decided this might interest her.  In a nutshell...she loved this place !!!  DO NOT wEAR YOUR SUNDAY BEST TO THIS PLACE !!  Yes, they give you a big roll of paper towels on the table....yes they give you that tacky lobster bib ( USE IT...YOU'RE NOT TO COOL )  she ordered a pound of the crawfish w/ house special sauce ( basically all the other sauces combined ) extra spicy.....i ordered the shrimp and sausage with medium sauce ( yeah,...i admit...i'm a wimp ! )  before getting the food my SO kept yakking about some city in china ( it may have been shanghai ...can't remember ) that there is a street of restaurants that only serve spicy crawfish ...she loves the stuff....she can be picky  about the food and how it's served - i was pleased she did not have attitude when her food came out in a plastic bag - no plates, forks, etc...just a bag of food...she put down a paper towel and she went to town...every now and then she would say...\"so good\"  or \"yummy-yummy\"  but for the most part just  kept working on those lil buggers...her cheeks getting redder and redder due to the heat...she was in heaven...we ordered another poiund...she ate that...she was still hungry....she is not a big eater....we ordered 2 pounds to go  Overall, it is a fun place...next time we will try the crab...btw...the shrimp were very good, lots of butter and garlic...i asked the server if they served bread ( they don't ) i wanted a roll to slop up the sauce at the bottom of the bag !!  a little pricey - total bill was $66...and we were still hungry ( but we did have an extra 2 pound bag ...SO ate that the next day for lunch )  we need places like this in the vegas valley !!!  Variety is the spice of life  UPDATE - 2ND VISIT -  tried the blue crab....SO loved it...too much work for me... after one crab, i went back to the shrimp - i was pleased to see they listen to their customers - they added the option of buying rice and also rolls....they also had a special - $2.50 coronas and heinekens....again, maybe a little pricey but this place is all good !  UPDATE 3RD VISIT ----  they've added king crab legs to the menu ...$20.95 / pound ....i guess i'm an elitist ...my only complaint about the KCL ...they don't cut them in 1/2 ....very tasty ! SO did her usual - 2 lbs of crawfish at the restaurant, 2 pounds to go - she thought this was the freshest batch of crawfish she's had in our 5 visits to H&J !"}
{"text":"This place is helllllllaaaa good. But on my last day in Vegas I got food poisoning from eating a bad crawfish from this place! Booooo but it was delicous before I got sick so minus one star"}
{"text":"Food is always super good! Our server Loren is super sweet and friendly. She did a great job taking care of us! Very good service, 11/10"}
{"text":"Never in my life had I ever had crawfish; so when my friends recommended to go here one night, I was down! Also, what is better than putting a bib while eating.  I am happy they have something like this in town. This place is new so definitely check it out. There might be some bad reviews in here, but my experience was pretty good. Anyway, the 6 of us got a table relatively fast since 2 of us got the table first. :P I wasn't sure if it was happy hour when we went or if that is the standard price but the shocktop was like $5 and we were like \"Yes, please!\"  Anyway, we did know how much we would eat so I let my friends who were experts at eating crawfish and shrimps picked it out. We first ordered one lb crawfish and 2 lbs shrimps. We heard that crawfish does not have much meat and shrimps would be more satisfying. I really did not know how little meat the crawfish had. It was basically like paying for the outside shell. You can totally tell we were noobs because we had gloves on when they offered it. I wouldn't use it next time, I rather dirty my hands with yumminess. We also ordered cajun fries and calamari. I didn't think for the price, it was worth it. It was gone before we started! Well from that, we ordered more because that was definitely not enough to feed 6 hungry people! Anyway, they have really spicy flavors; I wouldn't recommend it unless your taste buds can handle it.  We ended up ordering 3 more lbs of shrimps and one more basket of calamari.  At the end when our bill came, it was about $103; which was not too bad especially with the 6 of us. We all split and came to about $20 a person which includes tip. I would totally come back, but stay away from the crawfish and just stick with shrimp."}
{"text":"Call me crazy, but I can't help but be a little disappointed. Ordered a pound of shrimp, mild with the special seasoning, and some sweet potato fries to take back to the hotel. Mild my a**! I had to have a drink after every few pieces of shrimp. Eventually the garlic from the seasoning started to get too intense. Took a slight break (Oh you know, head over to Aria to grab a Four Loko and back.) before finally finishing up the bag. The fries were a tad soggy, even though they had poked holes through the container to let the steam escape. My room could have been mistaken for another Hot N Juicy location because it sure smelled like it once I was finished. I'll give myself some redemption and actually eat inside the restaurant next time."}
{"text":"SOOOOOOO GOOD!!! Its my favorite Crab restaurant here in Vegas. Nothing compares. The service is amazing, especially this last time we went AJ was great. The crab legs are delicious and the environment is perfect. Recommend this place to anyone who likes seafood.!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite places. Only bad part is the heavy garlic after taste for a day but amazing flavor when you're eating it. All the sauces are good but juicy Cajun is our favorite followed by garlic butter, hot n juicy, and lemon pepper.   We are oyster lovers and their oysters on the half shell are some of the best we've had!   Shrimp, lobster, green mussels, and snow crab legs are our go to"}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible. It's all about that hot n juicy sauce. One of my favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"Very poor service. I try to order a pick up by the phone. And the they told me to wait for a second for the answer. Then there is no voice or respond from the other side for 4 minutes. I tried to hang up and recall. It always busy signal from the other side. !!!!"}
{"text":"I was a newbie to this place and shocked to discover fresh crawfish are available.   I ordered Crawfish $10 per LB, Louisana Style and Mild. Mild was pretty spicy for me. Also, I ordered whole pieces of corn and it turn out being mixed with the Crawfish and I couldn't eat it.   Service: No bibs were given or offered until asked. Waiter was informed about us being newbie but did not mention about the sides being mixed with the crawfish. Waiter gave us a check with additional items on it and the total bill was double the price. We asked the waiter to correct it but then the bill was still wrong."}
{"text":"Always love coming here when I have a craving for seafood. Prices are not bad & the seafood is deliciously fresh & succulent."}
{"text":"I love seafood and I'm very happy the boiler open up close to my house .. My daughter took me there for the first time and I love it .. Food is good seasonings is awesome.. Staff very very friendly over all I will keep going back that for sure.."}
{"text":"I don't care what anybody else says, I HAVE TO SAY DELICIOUS!! FLAVOR IS EXPLOSIVE, PERFECT. This is the place to get your hands dirty....my favorite one is the shrimp garlic butter baby spice."}
{"text":"Really disappointed in our experience last night. The crawfish were VERY tiny. Great flavor, but had to struggle so much to get the meat out of the tiny shell that it mashed it all up. Talked to our server and she confirmed they were smaller than in the past. This was our 3rd time at this location and unfortunately, the last."}
{"text":"Amazing service and experience, Alexis our server was very nice and helpful. It was my first time going and the food was beyond my expectation. Must try this place out."}

{"text":"I usually have nothing but great things to say about Hot N Juicy .. I have been a regular of Hot N Juicy since I moved to Vegas in 2008 and you only had one location.. I usually go to the Spring Mountain Location and have zero Complaints.. Yesterday however two dumb down.. First when I walked in the hostess up front did not greet me at all instead asked if I had cover up... I immediately looked at her as if she was crazy.. First let me start off by saying I was wearing a Romper my boobs were not out or was my stomach showing.. It was a Romper I got from BEBE.. still no greeting instead saying I will have to ask you to leave if you don't have one talk about embarrassing right in front of my friend.. I'm again like what.. I figured I will just go to my car and grab my jacket but I was blown away.. Secondly my friend had to track down a waitress to refill his drink 3 times.. No one came over to our table once the food was delivered.. Just terrible.. Needless to say my normal 5 star review gets a  one star and that is only because I cannot give a zero star review.. I will not be returning to Hot N Juicy I will switch to Boiling Crab from now on.. Hot N Juicy no no from here on out .. You just lost a long time loyal customer.. No more Hot N Juicy Special Sauce I will now be a Whole Shabang Lover !!!!"}
{"text":"So, I'm the girl who saw this on Food Network Man vs Food and thought, that looks kinda strange! I'm the girl who when my sister and my boyfriend wanted to try it out thought, well, maybe I'll get some salmon or something. NO! Right when you walk in you are hit with this aroma, I can't even describe it, its garlicy, its cajun, it's deliciousnes! I tried a couple of the crawfish, and they were coo, I couldn't really get past the ripping of the heads and what not. BUT, I had their king crab legs, in the cajun seasoning and a side potato and corn and it was probably the best crab legs I have ever had! I craved it the rest of the trip and I have been back every time that I go to Vegas. My last trip was Hot N Juicy trip number 3! The only con? Not enough crab legs per bag!"}
{"text":"Shitty experience Ok there busy that's ok, ordered food very specifically and it came out wrong, crawfish was good and blue claws were good. Wanted to order more food and was given the check instead. Went to the counter to pay Manager gave me a thumbs up like everything ok said no wanted to order more food and was given a check. Still hungry... Left beyond dissatisfied, and hungry."}
{"text":"\"Pinch the head and suck the tail!\". This is what my friend told me while I was trying to eat one of  this restaurant's specialties! I laughed and told him that he sounded like he was describing a porno!!  But honestly, this place is great! I ordered a pound of the crawfish and a pound of the shrimp and chose the hot and juicy sauce and man it was fantasstic!  I honestly liked the shrimp better than the crawdads (that's we call them in Cali) because there was more meat on them and they were succulent and sweet.  But the crawdads and shrimp wash down with a cold beer after a night of debauchery in Vegas... nothing like it!!!!"}
{"text":"Everything was exceptional customer service. The food was amazing. Our server Draya was amazing. Always checked up on us and always got everything we needed very quickly. Always come back here. If you have Draya you'll be in luck!."}
{"text":"Crawfish cooked perfectly.  Its crazy that you have to ask for a bucket for the remnants. Trays would be better to contain the juice.  11.99/lb is pretty expensive when other places in town are 9.99/lb. Overall not bad."}
{"text":"Awesome place for seafood. Had the king crab and oysters. Oysters were fresh and delicious. Wait staff was great and would definitely go back to any Hot N Juicy Crawfish restaurant."}
{"text":"Ate there on our last night in Vegas. Food and service was great. Wait staff always helpful and smiling even though they were jamming."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful place to eat and a different dine-in experience.  Love this place... There shrimp with hot & juicy flavor extra spicy is mouth watering, lip burning & loads of taste bursting in your mouth.    Have been to this place way to many times and have taken all my family and friends who are in town visiting ... And 100% satisfied & thrilled with food, ambience, dining experience & service."}
{"text":"Came here with my bf once a month. Food was great, and clean. The staff was polite. Quickly but not rushed. I would recommend to anyone looking for the best crawfish around tempe or mesa area."}
{"text":"OMG! Why haven't I tried this place before? The clams are fresh and sooo tasty. The staff warn us not to take the hottest spice level. We listened and are grateful. We took the 2nd level down, be-careful when you eat the crawfish, the spicy juice may splatter into your eyes."}
{"text":"We miss this place!! When we lived in Las Vegas we took all our visitors who love seafood to this spot! They all loved it. The people are friendly and the food is good!! You will not be disappointed!! If you don't like spicy this is not the place for you...because it is really spicy, even if you order medium spice! I believe there are different flavors ie garlic butter...but you have to go there for their house special sauce."}
{"text":"Hot N Juicy is the originator of the infamous shrimp in a bag. I have been to Boiling crab and this Hot N Juicy is better in my opinion. The size of the shrimp and the quality and pricing was better. The oysters are massive. I truly enjoyed our experience. Our server was quite good. My wife did order a po'boy shrimp sandwich which wasn't that good. And my mom did order the battered butterflied shrimp. I found that to be overbattered. The sweet potato fries that came with it were quite good. We got some rice and we poured some of the shrimp sauce on it and it was sooo good. We wimped out and ordered baby spice on the shrimp. So delicious. We loved the concept of just eating with our hands. The flavor of the garlic butter came through very well. Suck the shrimp heads and then peel the body. Soooo good. We also ordered a pound of the crawfish which wasn't our fave. We preferred the shrimp for sure. We'll be back."}
{"text":"It was sooo BOMB that my family decided to eat there again, the day after we had first tried it. My parents are crazy about seafood and their palettes were made for identifying fresh/frozen. & lets just say they had NOTHING bad to say about this place. Our server, Robin, was sooo cuuute. She never stopped smiling and she seemed pretty down to earth. The place is small but it sure does get crackin.   Even though the bib may look ridiculous, i suggest you do wear it. :) unless of course, you wanna walk out with little orange spots on your top."}
{"text":"Yummy- huge shrimp for about $10 a pound. Huge crawfish for same price. My hubby and I ordered 2 pounds of crawfish and 2 pounds of shrimp. Yummy. Also ordered an extra potato and corn which they brought out in a styrofoam cup with the awesome hit n juicy special sauce with loads of garlic. Yummy. I loved it. We ordered medium and mild hit n juicy special seasoning. It is hot but good. And please ask for gloves because not only will your hand smell like garlic for days but if u have small cuts from peeling crawfish in your hands, all that spiciness will burn your hands. I would go back next time we come back.  U have to come by and try it out. Very casual atmosphere and awesome music. Wear casual clothing and tie up your hair.0, because u will get dirty from all that sauce on your hands."}
{"text":"Food is okay, nothing special. Market price is in line with other food in a bag restaurants. Bathrooms are worn and dirty. Restaurant is understaffed."}
{"text":"I was honestly expecting a long wait before getting seated but it was actually a slow Sunday night. My party was seated right away. We got Cajun fries for appetizers and they're probably the spiciest fries I've ever fasted. They were really good nevertheless. We also got 12 pieces of oysters. The oysters were really delicious because they were still juicy and still has the consistency of fresh oysters. They were also big oysters. The platter came with lemon and Tabasco Hot Sauce. For my main entrees, I got 1 lb of crawfish and shrimp. Both with the Hot N Juicy flavoring and mild level of spiciness. The shrimp were big and easy to peel and so were the crawfish. Beware though that \"mild\" is pretty spicy and should have enough kick to get your sinuses to open up. I would definitely come back to this location again because of their awesome customer service and great food. I highly recommend this place over other similar restaurants. Just remember to wash your hands really good or you will smell like crawfish all day!"}
{"text":"The service was terrible.  I think our server was having a bad day so we were afraid to ask her for things that we need to enjoy our meal.  Definetely the location on decatur and spring mountain its the best, service is always great and the staff are always happy...valleyview/spring mtn staff should learn from the staff in decatur branch...terrible lunch we had but still love the food in hot and juicy!!!"}
{"text":"Parking is tough, but it is worth it.  While my party was there, we had the crawfish (hot and juicy mild), shrip (hot an juicy mild), soft shell crab basket, sweet potato fries, and king crab legs.  Everything was excellent.  The shrimp were very large.  It would be great if they had more corn and potatoes in the crawfish, but I was there for the crawfish, not corn and potatoes, so I won't complain too much.  ;)  The soft shell crabs were so good, we got a second order.  the king crab legs were meaty and sweat.  good quality food.  the wait staff was excellent.  Being that it was our first time there, he took the time to explain it all and gave us time to \"digest\" the menu.  I will definitely go back when I'm in town again."}
{"text":"Bro. Don't come here. Horrible service, walked out hungrier than I was when I walked in and I got a free lip Botox injection. 0/5 stars."}
{"text":"Very messy but VERY good.  We had the shrimp and king crab legs and I highly recommend both!"}
{"text":"I used to look forward to Boiling Crab before I tried this. Now it's 1 of go to spots whenever I'm in Vegas. The sauce just seems way better."}
{"text":"The wait time was 20 minuets but it didn't even feel like we waited 10 minuets. The food looked like it tasted fantastic. The servers were on top of it coming and asking to top off our drinks ect. Theres a lot of space so you don't feel like your bumping into people like most hot& juicy. Come check it out."}
{"text":"Im so pissed off? Ive been this place for many times in dinning and take to go?and it's all good except slow.  today?I place an order on the phone?some guy took my order . After 20 mins like he says? I have my bf go pick up the food. And when his there?he was told the order is canceled? The food was NEVER made? and the kitchen just closed? They says they called me back but I told them the wrong number????  WTF?? Seriously? The guy work there repeated my number wrong and I correct him?apprently and he still wrote it wrong?Is that my fault that the guy was so stpuid to write a correct phone number and so irresponsible about the order?and Why would you call back to confirm the order all of sudden why you guys never done that before??And not telling the customers you would have a confrim call at the first place??   I order the food?wait the time?take a taxi get there?didnt get anything and was fucking staving. The ppl work there all they say is \"NOTHING we can do\" RUDELY?I understand this place is busy. The customer service and some employees are just unfriendly and not responsiable?VERY DISAPPOINTING?"}
{"text":"First stop to vegas was this place. I'm so glad they open late because I was so hungry after my flight. Me and my friend ordered fried calamari (which tasted like any calamari you can get anywhere else), the green mussels (best mussels I've ever had! The juice they mixed with the mussels was amazing, I dipped all my other food in it), and \"the drool\" which is plenty enough to share with someone else. It had shrimp, crab legs, Crawfish, corn and sausages. We got the \"hot n juicy\" flavor which they're known for. I love the fact that they give you bibs and gloves\" so you don't get too messy. Will definitely eat here again!!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place. Evetything was great and the hot and juicy seasoning was wonderful."}
{"text":"Finally, I got to try the creme de la creme a la cajun-styled seafood: HNJ! I love that crack-a-lackin seafood joints are becoming an upcoming trend.   As a seafood lover, you really can't be afraid to crack-attack, and dig in for your meat. For great seafood, it is oh-so-worth it!  This style is new to the Chicago area, and I have a girlfriend who can't stop raving over how much better this one is than our Chicago options.  Back on to food.  Oysters: we ordered a half dozen. Fresh, yum, cleaned well, good sized meat.  Sausage: a little spicy for my liking, but still good. I don't have too high a tolerance for too much salt.  Snow crab legs: Fat and juicy. Good amount of meat. Good crack to the shell, indicating good freshness. The meat's own sweet flavor still shone through, despite the HNJ sauce we smothered it with love in.  Shrimp: also fat and juicy. fresh and plump, but i couldn't conquer for the life of me. Between 3 girls, we ordered 1lb of crab each, and split a half pound of shrimp.  Even then, too much for us, despite all of its hot and juicy glory.  it made me SOOOO appreciate that this spot supports a half pound of shrimp. Save that cash for the pricier proteins.  extra bonuses: I love that they offered gloves, to keep that seafood smell away from under your nails. The gloves aren't great, and they really mess with your dexterity, but hey. If you've got a hot date, or an outing with friends, you don't want that seafood-smelly-give-away to follow you aruond all day.  Definitely becomin my gold standard. When in Vegas, I'll always have to find my way off the Strip to make it to this joint. It is definitely a go-to-gem that no foodie in Vegas should miss out on!"}
{"text":"Again, yelp pointed me towards this gem.  The waitress was kind enough to warn us that the crawfish was out of season before we ordered it so it would all be frozen.  She also walked us through the menu.  The only complaint I have was when we asked us about mild spice vs. no spice for my daughter's crawdads order.  She said mild wasn't too spicy so we ordered it and it ended up not being very \"mild\" at all.  We ordered a new batch with no spice and she \"reminded\" us that the mild was kind of spicy, which was not what she actually said but who cares!  The food was pretty awesome and I didn't go there to argue so I pressed!  I also ordered the fried soft shell crab with cajun fries and it was very tasty.  The fries were pretty good!  Get ready to put your plastic bib on and dig in!  Overall, very good food and I would definitely check it out again."}
{"text":"I used to live in Nawlins and my friend took me here to try it out and see if it was the real deal.  It definitely was.    We went in there with big hangovers and appetites.  The waitress was engaging and attentive.  My friend and I had fun goofing around with her while asking questions and trying to make decisions.    We ordered a bunch of dungie and crawdads along with some baskets of fried stuff.  Over the course of the next hour we did our best to eat it all--we ordered too much--while having fun with the people at the tables around us.    All in all it was a great crowd and we had a good time."}
{"text":"Can someone tell me why there is two Hot n Juicys on the same road?  Anyway. This place is like my regular Friday joint with friends. Great place. Come early, like 5pm for dinner, or else the wait and parking is AWFUL. We arrived at 5:30 and parking was already terrible, we left at 6ish and the line outside was insanity. Parking was impossible. This place is not as big as it looks.  The food is great! I always get the shrimp in the original flavor, but one word of caution, IT IS SPICY! Yeah yeah I know, you like spicy but seriously. This is SPICY. My friend who is a spice lover even remarked that he thought it was a little too much at level 5. I got level 1 (yeah I know I'm a wimp) and my nose was running.  It gets messy as you have to peel the shrimp/crawfish/crabs yourself by hand. Everything is served in plastic bags and they do provide bibs and plastic gloves, but most just use their bare hands. Don't wear your best clothes.  This place is great, as long as you come early, or don't mind waiting. It's okay though, there are plenty of little shops nearby to shop in while you wait."}
{"text":"I never thought I'd find a better cajun seafood place than Boiling Crab until I came here. Sorry BC but Hot N Juicy just has their sauce spot on. Something about that Hot N Juicy Special sauce, it has a similar taste to the \"whole shebang\" but it has a creamy/butter factor that knocks it out of the park.   Got a pound of shrimp and a pound of crawfish with a side of cajun fries. It was awesome!"}
{"text":"October 12, 2015   I gave this popular spot another chance hoping that the service has improved since our last visit. We arrived at 6:20pm and was seated in a timely manner. We placed our order with Sara shortly after. My order came out first at 6:30pm and I wanted to wait for my fiancé's order to come out so we can eat together. 7:00pm came along and my foods getting cold. We didn't see our waiter around so we followed up on her order with a different lady. She went to go check on the status and did not get back to us. 7:15pm other people that came after us were receiving their orders. And it continued until we asked for our check to pay for only what was served. They thought it was a kind gesture on their part to leave with free food..it only added insult to injury. Definitely or last time going there."}
{"text":"Finally, I found a place that is comparable to my favorite Boiling Crab (BC). I'm talking about crawfish and the fries since that is all I've tried here.   With great reviews and how it was on Man vs. Food. It was a must try on my list when I went to Vegas. I got the hot and juicy special crawfish because the waiter said it's similar to BC's \"whole shabang.\" It is indeed 90% similar, and the 10% is that it was overload with garlic. Yup!! I was safe from vampires the whole weekend. Thank you hot n juicy, but no thanks. My garlic scent caused Jeremiah (the dude who sang birthday sex) to not show up at Chateau Paris Night Club that night. It was a sad day.  Ok, I exaggerate a little, but yeah I was a little overwhelmed with how much garlic is in it (and I love garlic). Nonetheless, the crawfish was succulent and fingers licking. The cajun fries were also so good, a tab better than BC's fries.   The staff was friendly so that is a plus.   Crawfish was $8.99/lb...expensive! But I guess the price came with fame.  I'd recommend this place if you like BC or/and garlic of course."}
{"text":"I saw a friend of mine mention Hot N Juicy on her Facebook wall while I was in Vegas and quickly Googled it.  It looked EXACTLY like The Boiling Crab in California and right then and there I knew I would be heading down to Hot N Juicy for a meal while I was in Vegas.  It's a seafood place were you order seafood by the pound.  You then choose what type of sauce you want your seafood brought to you in.  They have lemon pepper, cajun, garlic butter etc and you can choose a level of spiciness.  You can also get items added to your seafood like sausage, corn and potatoes.    They have the regular sides like rice, fries etc.  Once you place your order they bring you a bib and a few minutes later you're brought a bag of delicious juiciness with the seafood that you ordered.  This time I ordered a pound of snow crabs in lemon pepper sauce and a pound of shrimp in cajun sauce.  I got my order a little spicy.  They were both fantastic and at a pretty reasonable price.  The shrimp was $10 and the snow crabs were $17 per pound each.  You're guaranteed to be a mess after this meal so you might as well get down and dirty!"}
{"text":"Went there tonight for dinner, I will not be back. We ordered 2lbs of shrimp, 3 potatoes, 3 corn, rice, bread and chicken tenders. We got our shrimp after 15 minutes. We asked for the other items and the server, Amanda assured everything else would be out after. 30 minutes later we still did not get anything besides the shrimp. The server constantly said everything else comes out in increments, which is not true since every other table got there food before us. She continued arguing until I asked for a manager, who was unhelpful as well. Our food was not sent to the kitchen because they said the kitchen just received our order. We finally received the chicken and bread after the shrimp was finished. When we received the bill, not a single item was comped. Not even the bread!  Amanda, word of advise, do not argue with the customer when you forget to put an order in. It is very unwise, especially when you work for tips. Please do us all a favor and say sorry."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday i usually go to the one in Tempe. I ordered lb of shrimp and a lb of crab legs cajun fries a beer and a sweet tea also ordered 2 pieces of corn. To start off the service was lousy the sauce on the seafood was oily and gross. It took the server like 20 minutes to bring the corn and it was hard and cold. The waitress should probably go work somewhere else serving is not for her. Lousy food lousy service i'll never go back $55.00 you can buy a lot of fresh shrimp and cook it yourself with that money."}
{"text":"well. I was able to visit this Quasi-famous eatery (man vs. food) tonight and I'm 90% pleased. the location is ideal (edge of Chinatown), the wait staff was helpful and easy on the eyes, and the food was magnificent. my friend and I ordered 2 lbs of crawfish, 1 lb of shrimp, 1 lb of crab legs, cajun fries, 3 bud lights and a soda.  our total was $64. not depressing but our \"fullness\" level could have been higher for the money spent.   all in all the experience was great and I will definitely be back for seconds."}
{"text":"Hot and juicy medium with some rice on the side! Oh yeah I love coming here after a hard day at work and working to get my food. I like to think I have great patience! It is well worth it though.. Mixed with rice ask occasionally a corn or potato! I'll be back again and again"}
{"text":"I am a humble local food critic, and I have to give one star to Hot and Juicy. We have been to this location on NUMEROUS occasions. Every time we went, we ate inside, and loved the food!! The last two times, we got takeout. Boy, was that a horrible idea!! Mind you, we have to drive 30 minutes to get there, and 30 minutes to get home. The first time we got takeout, the pound of snow crab and the 4, that's right, 4 pounds of crawfish were cooked in the wrong sauce and WAY too spicy. My friend was visiting from out of town, and is a breastfeeding mother. Her snow crab was so hot, it was practically on fire. Brutal. I called and talked to the manager Olena. She said she would comp the pound of snow crab and the 4 pounds of crawfish. I was pissed, but I was satisfied because we really liked the food normally. A week later, on 9/20/2014, I decided to order takeout again. Bad freaking idea AGAIN!! I didn't call it in this time, because I wanted to make sure we would get what Olena promised me. I order. Of course. Olena only comped us 2 pounds of crawfish. I was upset, but there was no manager there for me to talk to, so I just paid for the extra two pounds. We also ordered rice, shrimp, and an order of catfish and fries to go. Our order comes out, the guy that brought it out quickly goes through it. He says it's all there. I say thanks and walk out. As we are driving away, I think about the catfish and fries. I didn't remember seeing it. So, I look in the bag. ITS NOT IN THE BAG. UGH!! And of course it's 5:00 traffic. 5 mins later I walk back in to get the catfish. I look at the same lady that helped us and she grabs the bag sitting on the counter. Wtf? I guess she already knew that they forgot, and they were WAITING for me to come back. So frustrating. Here is the worst part: As I'm walking out, I glance back and all the staff behind the counter are laughing about it. Seriously? Is this how you train your staff? I realize they are all 15, but come on. We will be going to the Boiling Crab from now on. Too many broken promises and horrible customer service...."}
{"text":"Interesting way to feast on seafood in a plastic bag, on plastic table cloth, wearing plastic bib and plastic gloves. Intro starter combo has 1 lb crawfish, 1 lb shrimps, sausages, corn and potatoes. Crawfish has little meat, depends whether you like sucking on head with bile. Shrimps are fresh and yummy in hot n juicy seasoning, mild is pretty spicy enough. Recommend to skip the crawfish and go for shrimps!"}
{"text":"The worst service! This management team doesn't have a F*****ing clue! I will never eat, recommend this place again!"}
{"text":"This bag full of flavor and heat is sooo worth it. My man and I have a pretty big appetite and we've only managed to finish half way... We got a lot left for midnight snack haha!!!"}
{"text":"Seafood in a bag.... no one does it better than Hot N Juicy. One of the gems in Vegas off the strip. Whats makes this place special is the sauce they cook the seafood in. Every time I'm in Vegas I come here at least once. Hand down better than Boiling Crab and other places I've been to. I don't know how they do it in the South but this is definitely the Best in the West."}
{"text":"This location is much nicer and newer than the one down the street from it.  I've never had to wait very long to be seated at this one.  As far as the food goes, if you love messy finger food that comes equipped with a bib, you'll love Hot and Juicy. Their spice is not for the faint of heart! Even their mild spice has a good amount of kick. So far I've tried their shrimp, crawfish, corn fritters, and fries. You have to peel the shrimp and crawfish yourself.  It's a bit of a hassle, but it's part of the experience.   Don't waste your time or money on the crawfish.  Big creature, small amount of meat.  1 lb of shrimp in Hot N Juicy seasoning is the way to go.   Keep in mind that when you order by the pound, that includes the weight of the entire shrimp body, antennas, legs, and the juice. Their seasoned fries are burn-your-face-off spicy, and with all the spice in the shrimp, I found it overwhelming. Their corn fritters are crispy, creamy, sweet balls of corny goodness.  They pair perfectly with the spicy shrimp.  For those who have children or unenthusiastic seafood eaters in your group, they also offer things like chicken strips and popcorn shrimp on their menu.  Oh and unless you want your fingers to burn for hours after the meal and garlic scented fingertips for the next week, WEAR THE GLOVES!"}
{"text":"This location is not as nice as the one down the street. There's less seating, less parking, and it's just more rundown.

{"text":"I was served by Rashad earlier for lunch and he was phenomenal, definitely coming back!!"}
{"text":"This is a great place if you are in the need for seafood. Service was amazing and great prices. If you love garlic go with the garlic butter spicy."}
{"text":"The great food but the service was bad. First we didn't get our drinks until I was done with my appetizer and we had to ask for them. Second the second appetizer (sweet potato fries) didn't even come out until we were done with the main food and we had to ask about them too.   The one stars is for the service  I would give 5 stars for the food"}
{"text":"Mmm Hot & Juicy!  Indeed!  I came here for a bachelorette party in the summer.  I took the bachelorette to Hot & Juicy as we waited for the other bridesmaids to arrive.  There was a long line of people waiting outside.  It was a Thursday night.  The staff told it was a 45 minutes wait, so we decided to go cross the street and go grocery shopping.  I wanted to buy some fruits and snacks for the hotel.  By the time we got back, we were directed to our table.  I've heard such good things about this place from my girlfriends who were locals, skinny, extremely glamorous, and they can eat!   The bachelorette ordered 1 lb of shrimp with the Hot & Juicy special sauce, garlic fries, and I ordered 1 lb of crawfish as well as buttered corn on the cob.   They all come out piping hot in a plastic bag.  We received a bib however,  we did not get any gloves as did some of my fellow yelpers.  I guess we didn't order enough food?  My buttered corn was completely soaked in butter and spices, it was so salty and soft.  I couldn't eat it.  I just wanted boiled corn and they said I had to be more specific.  You had to say boil corn or something.  My waiter was horrible.  He wasn't that attentive.  He gave me attitude because he had to take that corn back and gave me a different corn.  My 2nd corn was still super soft and with tons of butter.  I was super disappointed.  I love corn too!   Ah, did I forget to mention that I had to ask where my corn was?  He had forgotten to place an order of the corn.  He didn't even apologize for forgetting.  He just brought out that soggy salty corn.  Anyway, on to the review of the rest of the meal, it was yummy!  The crawfish was fresh.  All the shells were hard and not soft.  So that's how you would know if the crawfish is fresh or not.  The flavors of the garlic and spices were so good.  It was definitely a finger licking experience.  For the two of us, 1 lb each on shrimps and crawfish was enough.  I don't normally eat that much shrimp, but crawfish I can eat a lot of.  I'd recommend coming to this place for the experience, maybe not so much for the corn.  It was actually kind of neat to see them serving white rice as a side dish.  Next time I visit Vegas, I'm definitely coming back.  We have a Crawfish King in Seattle and I do not like that place at all.  I'll do a review on that place later."}
{"text":"Went here with my boyfriend for the first time last week. I was impressed with the food &service, my waitress Stephanie never kept us waiting and kept our glasses full, checked on us few times through out our meal and tended to our every request. The food was amazing!  Food comes fully shelled so you have to peel it yourself, a little work but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Service was great as was the good. Waitress missed a request for water but it was a busy night. Our shrimp order was late but they made up for it. Dress down, and go spicy or go home."}
{"text":"Horrible Service from MAX!!!!! He is the WORST!! POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE and NO COMPASSION TOWARDS CHILDREN AT ALL!!!!!He kicked us out of the restaurant because we brought outside food for our toddler. He told us my son had to eat outside or hurry up and eat. Five minutes later he comes back and says sorry he's taking too long he's gonna have to eat outside.  MAX is an Idiot to think I'm going to rush my son to eat and cause him to choke!!  We've been bringing my son outside food to all or most of their locations all over the valley for 5 years and NO ONE has ever said anything to us about it EVER!! MAX had to be the cold hearted jerk to complain and KICK US OUT! And we didn't want to bring outside food we HAD TO bring Nuggets and Fries from somewhere else because MY CHILD had ADVERSE REACTIONS from the Nuggets and Fries basket that they sell. When we were at their Henderson location the manager there saw my son eating Panda Express and didn't say anything or kick us out. We told them the reason and that we had to bring it and they understood because they didn't want to be held accountable or be liable if something awful were to happen to any of their customers, especially children. They also disclosed that ALL the food they sell has traces of seafood! Because EVERYTHING they cook in their restaurant is fried in the same seafood oil, same cookware, etc.....So, as a parent we weren't going to take that risk. And it's not like we're just taking my son to eat there and we're not ordering from their menu. We eat there once a month averaging $100 each time MAX even had the audacity to say it was his manager complaining and rushing him when that was a damn lie!! Because as we were leaving she said \"Oh you guys don't have to leave\". I told her well MAX told us we have to leave right now and make my son eat outside. So, I don't know what his problem was but he should be suspended or fired for being unprofessional and heartless and doing that to my son. I will never ever eat there again! Nor will I recommend them to our friends and family. What a bad example to such a great establishment. It's employees like MAX that shuts businesses down. Because people will stop going to their establishment therefore the company loses money.  Word of mouth is a powerful thing!  Most especially Reviews like this. It can and will spread like wildfire!! THANK YOU YELP for giving customers a place to  share their experiences and feedback!  Whether positive or negative."}
{"text":"Super yummy! Friendly service and delicious food!!!! If you are not a fan of spice go for the lowest level (not so spicy)! Be warned the mild version is still a bit spicy.   The hot N juicy special is so tasty you won't regret it (unless you loath spice).  An order of rice is so necessary because the sauce is too good to waste!    The service at the eastern location is on point! I went in for lunch at 12pm and it was not busy (WARNING this place is usually jammed pack) I would recommend coming when the doors open to skip the long wait.  Don't get me wrong eating here is totally worth the wait!   The shrimp was cooked perfectly. The crab is succulent and sweet!  The crawfish is cleaned well and sweet to the taste.  The staff makes eye contact and constantly runs checks throughout the restaurant. Very cohesive team working here.    The atmosphere is nice too. The eastern location has an open feel to it compared to the original location. I Highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a fun and delicious dining experience."}
{"text":"An awesome seafood restaurant I love their food especially the shrimp cooked in medium or hot sauce with garlicky sauce!! It's delicious I can come here and eat their shrimps for daily basis!!"}
{"text":"This place makes that best hot & juicy flavored shrimps!!! Everything else is on the average side. I always order the hot and juicy shrimp here they have is out of this world!!! They have a scale of spicy level you want from hot medium mild. Price is somewhat a little higher than it's competitors. The dining inside seems to be always packed and somewhat noisy. All the servers went female and somewhat reminds me of hooters.."}
{"text":"Tried going to Boiling Crab, got stuck with a 30-45 minute wait. Went to Hot & Juicy instead, got super lucky and was seated in 10 minutes.   Pick your seafood of choice (dungeness crab, blue crab, king crab, snow crab legs, lobster, clams, shrimp or crawfish), how many pounds, sauce (Louisiana style, garlic butter, lemon pepper, juicy cajun, or hot & juicy -- which is all combined), choose your spice level (baby spice, mild, medium, spicy, extra spicy), pick additives (corn on the cob, potatoes, sausage, etc)... AND WATCH THE MAGIC UNFOLD! Everything gets mixed up in a plastic bag, served hot. Tables are covered with plastic & you are given plastic bibs. They provide plastic gloves, but what's the fun in that? Tie up your hair, roll up your sleeves and get in there!    We order the same thing: - A POUND OF SHRIMP, HOT & JUICY WITH TWO CORNS. Not a fan of spicy foods, I opt for \"baby spice\" and he goes for mild. We both also get a side of rice!   TIP: They also give you little cups of salt & pepper and lemon wedges. Squeeze those babies in there and they make a zesty dipping sauce!   CON: Do not go here hoping to do much afterwards. Your hair, nails, clothes, purse, life in general will leave with an intense garlic/shrimp aroma that will not leave until you shower and wash your clothes! :D"}
{"text":"This is an updated review from my 2011 original review; the location is the newly open restaurant that is up the street from the original Hot N Juicy location.  Parking is still a bit tricky but definitely more space.  Crawfish are still a bugger to eat, it is fun sucking and slurping up the juice that marinades the crawfish.  Once you have accomplish all the sucking and slurping, you are rewarded with the tiniest meat but it is all so worth it!  My suggestion is go in a group so you are able to order in bulk and try everything! Ordering steps are pretty easy; it takes 3 steps to order you scrumptious crustacean.  Step one, order your seasoning, step 2, order the hotness of your seasoning and step three, order your crustacean!  Now it's not just a crawfish place, they offer lobster, crabs, shrimps and clams.  So don't get put off because of the crawfish, there's other crustacean for you to choose from.   The wait is still the same, first come first serve!  No reservation and be patient.  But the wait is so worth it!  P.S. Be prepare to get a little dirty, so don't wear your church whites or \"date\" clothes; come prepare to get stained a bit! ;)"}
{"text":"Such a different style of meal! I always look forward to this when in Vegas! Get the garlic blend! So delicious! Sometimes there is a long wait.. But what do you expect for good food :)"}
{"text":"Spicy really means spicy, and medium means medium! Finally a place that got the heat system right!"}
{"text":"This place is so good that I have deemed it a mandatory stop on my Vegas trips.  I like to get the crawfish and a bowl of rice; just drizzle your rice with the juices from the crawfish bag (and from the crawfish heads) and go to town on that sucker.  Mmm mmm mmm.  I see that many people like the king crab...I'll have to try that next time.  As others have mentioned, the only downsides are the small parking lot, the wait times and the bill - but it is all worth it.  Just step inside and breathe in and you'll know what I, and countless others, are talking about."}
{"text":"The greatest food in Las Vegas! Daniell and Katherine make my day better!"}
{"text":"I come here quite a bit and love it but I ordered the dungeon crab that was $21, for the check & it was $40. If it is going to be a price difference I would appreciate if someone let me know . Other than that it was amazing."}
{"text":"Amazing the shrimp are delicious juicy and sweet try it with the hot and juicy sauce medium. My mouth was on fire but loved every moment of it ... So satisfying the crawfish were yummy too you just have to get the pinch and suck down... Will be back as always wish they had one in atx (insert sad face here."}
{"text":"My favorite place in earth!!! Lemon pepper spicy shrimp, corn, and rice is what I always get. This deserves 300 stars!! It's so different from any other restaurants. Bringing a date here is highly recommended cuz you will find out ASAP if your date is down for anything."}
{"text":"Went here on a busy Friday night. Was told the wait for 2 people would be about 40 mins, but was seated by 30mins. BF & I shared a pound of shrimp & asked for it to be mild since I don't like spicy at all. Waited for another 30 mins to get our order only to find that our server accidentally put our order wrong on the level of spiciness. She immediately apologized and so again we waited for another 15mins. When we finally got our shrimp, we realized we also never got the side of rice we ordered. Apparently the server also forgot to put that order down. The only thing I can say she got right that night was the sweet potato fries lol. Food was ok.. seasoning was pretty good on the shrimp and sweet potato fries were great, but I don't think I'll be coming back here anytime soon."}
{"text":"For the longest time I grappled with  leaving a review or to not.  After hearing so many great things about Hot N Juicy from friends, family and chef's I was really looking forward to this place!!  I knew what it was all about before I got there.  Rolling up yer sleeves and gettin down n' dirty with pound bags of some critters of the sea......  We heeded the warnings of early yelpers and went at an off time so we didn't have to wait an hour.  We ordered crawdads, crab and shrimp.  I had never had crawfish to eat before but I had caught these lil buckaroos as a kid when my ADD would leave me catching critters in the lakes I was fishing in INSTEAD of watching my fishing pole. I was not a fan of my first crawfish experience but I don't hold that against Hot N Juicy , probably just wasn't for me.  The shrimp were average and the king crab legs were good.  The hardest thing for me reviewing Hot N Juicy was it might just not be for me.  The concept is cool but after my experience I don't want my seafood to be masked with a flavor of garlic and chile for lbs on end.  I want to taste the natural sweetness, or flavor of freshly squeezed lemon juice and allow the protein to be in the spotlight it deserves.  My two star rating isn't for the cuisine here though.  I realize it just wasn't for me.  I was more disappointed and left unsure of the cleanliness of the dining room.  I am not a neat-freak.... I knew going into this that it was dirty.  I was not expecting the table fun to extend to the walls of the restaurant though.  We were seated in a booth in the back of the restaurant that during the time of our dining had direct sunlight on the wall.  That entire wall was the spotlight of 100 different greasy, juicy paw prints that made it look like kids finger painting with crisco.  It actually pains me to leave a negative review of a restaurant that gets so many rave reviews from fellow yelpers.  Cleanliness needs to be improved dramatically.  Hot N Juicy needs to get Hot and Soapy......"}
{"text":"The manager Eve Rodriguez is rude, disrespectful, and unprofessional! We ordered 6 pounds of shrimp and only 5 came out. We waived down several waiters and told them we haven't gotten our last pound. About an hour after waiting, we had to get up and stand at the kitchen until we got our last pound of shrimp... after our party was already done eating, the last  person was left to eat alone once their food finally came out over an hour and a half after the other orders. That individual was also charged for an extra drink that wasn't ordered nor received when our bill finally came out after 10 minutes of waiting for the check. We asked them to remove the extra drink charge and comp the meal, but instead the manager decides to tell us there's nothing he can do for us. After talking, he agreed to 25% off. This is HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE ON THE PART OF THE MANAGER!!! Hope the owner & management talk to their workers and learn that the customer is always right, especially if they have them wait an hour and a half for food when the restaurant is only at half capacity. (On a side note, there was also another party that had to wait 2 hours for a missing item from their order) But at least the food was good?"}
{"text":"This is my first time trying Hot N Juicy Crawfish and I have to agree with the other Yelpers when they say that the crawfish yield is not worth it.  My homegirls from NYC came to visit and I suggested that we try this place since none of us have ever tried crawfish.  So here we are 1 guy and 3 girls and we ordered 1 lb of crawfish - hot and juicy spicy sauce, 1 dungenuss crab - hot and juicy spicy sauce, 1 lb of shrimp - garlic butter sauce, cajun fries and 3 corn on the cob.  The shrimp yields more meat than the crawfish, however the hot and juicy spicy sauce is the way to go if you can take the heat!!  It'll get your lips burning at the end of the meal.    The dungenuss crab was the star of the night for us.  It was 1.8 lbs and about $28.  We had it made with the hot and juicy spicy sauce and it came whole, which means you had to do the dirty work yourself.  Getting down and dirty with crab is my thing!  I go to any buffet and ill sit there and eat crab legs all night long!  Anyways, the sauce and the crab was fantastic!  It was sooo good we ended up going to the supermarket the next day and bought 4 two pound dungeness crabs, one for each of us, so we could make some more crab. LoL   Anyways, 4 pounds of seafood and 5 beers later, we were stuffed.  We enjoyed our food.  We would suggest the crawfish if you've never had them before, but the shrimp is better.  Must get the dungeness crab if you are willing to spend the money.  Total charge was $80 including tip, not bad for 4 people.  I will definitely go back there with more out of town friends."}
{"text":"This is the first Hot n Juicy I visited. I loved the food. It was a busy night and fast paced night. But the service was on top of things. But the layout of the tables is not my favorite; I prefer the Hot N Juicy in the Chinatown plaza area."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Hot N Juicy location. But I can't pick a favorite between this place and the Boiling Crab. I love both of them. This place had good service, plentiful napkins and gloves :) No gloves offered at the Boiling Crab."}
{"text":"I love love love Hot n Juicy Crawfish food. I am so addicted to their signature sauce in \"spicy\". I am really put off by the club music though.  This prompts me to take my order to go. Ideally some blues would compliment the fare or old R&B. I would rather listen to death metal than trendy club music.  For food that has so much soul the ambiance should compliment it."}
{"text":"Ever since watching the Man v. Food episode featuring Hot N Juicy, I've wanted to try it out. I'm a big fan of Boiling Crab in LA, but I wanted to try HNJ as well. I wasn't sure which was the original location, but I went to the Valley View location because it was on the way to my next destination. I don't think it matters too much. You get the same recipe and it's a matter of cooking or steaming the food correctly.   We ordered 2 lbs of snow crabs, 1 lb of jumbo shrimp (both Hot N Juicy seasoning-medium), and 1 lb of clams (garlic butter-baby spice). A little pricey at a hair under $75, but well worth it. Sauce was robust in flavor and very spicy! The medium left my mouth burning and the baby spice even had a kick. My guess is that the HNJ seasoning is a mix of cajun and garlic.The shrimp and clams were very large and meaty.   We did take out (and a good thing because I was sweating so much). The added bonus is that we had a pot of cooked rice on standby. With it being so spicy, I needed to cool off by eating some bland rice. However, there's so much extra sauce (it's MESSY) and I got to enjoy the flavors with my bowl of rice. It's a great compliment to the rice."}
{"text":"We ordered 1 lb of hot and juicy shrimp. Spice of level: baby spice. Food is delicious! Can't complain and comparable w/ boiling crabs."}
{"text":"I'm not sure about this place. I really like the boiling crab in K Town, so I thought I would give this a try. I came here with my cousin around 4:30. We were seated right away and avoided the dinner rush. We were given our bibs and proceeded to order.   I ordered 1 lb of shrimp and my cousin ordered a lot more.  The food was good. The corn, the shrimp, it was all good. I really think it needed more sauce. Maybe my bag didn't have as much sauce as the other reviewers or maybe that's how it is here.   Maybe I'll try it again. There's one on Eastern, so I'll try that one. It is better than average, I just wasn't wowed.  Sorry folks"}
{"text":"Flavorful shrimp, crab, corn, and sausage swimming in Hot n Juicy, garlic, spicy sauce. Coke and rice balanced it all out and we had the sweetest waitress. Nautical/ Cajun theme and lots of tvs made it a fun place to eat too. Great find on the strip! (well three doors around the corner, technically)"}
{"text":"This review is dedicated to Thomas O. (1 of 5- high five!): I grew up in New Orleans, so crawfish is something I have grown up eating. Since moving away in 1998, I have been searching for some decent Cajun food, and an authentic crawfish boil is no exception. So on my most recent trip to Vegas, I knew I had to stop by Hot N Juicy Crawfish. The name alone warrants a visit to the place! Right when we landed, we headed to HNJC, we didn't even check into our hotel! The wait was a brief 20 minutes. I ordered 2 pounds of crawfish in the special sauce-- medium spicy (I think it was a level 8 of 10). I thought I could handle it. After all, I am Asian and from New Orleans- a lethal combo, duh! In 10 minutes, my crawfish arrived hot and steaming in my own personal bag. I burned my fingers trying to peel the first couple of crawfish, but I could not wait. The garlic juices were running down my fingers-- thank goodness for my bib. The size was smaller than what I am used to seeing, but the Cajun flavor I was craving was present and the spice was just perfect. ok, I couldn't take it. It was sooooo hot! But honey badger don't care. I kept burning my fingers, burning my mouth, and eventually, burning my stomach. Will I go again? Hell yeah."}
{"text":"It was the most weirdest thing ever rip off the heads  of those shrimp but I must say it was the most Juiciest piece of shrimp I ever had in my life!! FYI I had to go back the following day!!!"}
{"text":"The seafood was very high quality. We had shrimp, crawfish and crab legs. Never eaten here before so \"Dixie\" our server was helpful in explaining the menu to us and even showing us how to open the crawfish. The crab legs were my favorite. Very large and flavorful. The service is what stood out to me. Dixie was always stopping by to see if we needed drink refills, more gloves, items cleared. She really did a great job! I'm not a huge fan of cajun spices so I can't say I will go here a lot, but it was a fun and new experience and the seafood was cooked perfectly!"}
{"text":"The best blue crab I've ever had in life. I can't even. Can't wait to try it again on my next trip."}
{"text":"We heard about this place Spring of 2010 and finally went January 2011 when I was in the mood for some mud-bugs!  We moved to Las Vegas from Louisiana. We only lived in Louisiana for 2 1/2 years but that's long enough to know about some good southern food!  My husband and I got the same thing; 2 pounds of Crawfish with Spicy Cajun (Louisiana Style, Garlic Butter and Lemon Pepper) flavoring with medium spice level. I myself noticed the spice level in the corn since we had the corn and potato added to the bag's of Crawfish. Medium was even spicier than what we ever had in Louisiana, but the waiter did inform us to go down a level of what we were used to.  The Crawfish was pretty good all in all. My husband and I both only had about 5 good sized Crawfish in each of our bags, maybe since it's off season. So that was a disappointment. I wish that they would clean the the Crawfish before they cook them. It's not fun looking at a Crawfish that looks like it still has dirt and sand on it.....ya ya ya I know their called mud-bugs but still. I know that would take some time for them to do but it just looks better. Your going to a Crawfish joint not a Chinese Buffet with Crawfish.  It was kinda pricey since we're used to paying a couple bucks a sack in Louisiana, granted here they are the ones taking the time to boil them. During off season with live Crawfish (the waiter said some night's they're frozen) it worked out to be about $10-$11per pound. (On the menu for Crawfish it does say market price, the waiter said during season it might be about $8 per pound) They don't have a kids menu so we had to pay $7.50 for our 3 year old daughter to get a chicken nugget's and fries basket. For all 3 of us we got a total of 4lbs. Crawfish, 2 extra corn's, chicken and fries basket, 1 soda and 2 water's and our bill was $65.00 before tip. We will try to get back before we move out of state this summer but we are also planning on having some shipped in from Louisiana and doing our own Crawfish boil so we'll see. If we were staying here in Vegas I'm sure we would go back.   I"}
{"text":"One of the better crawfish places I've been to. Cajun Fries are more kicking than most places, which is good!  Not too much garlic in the juices which is nice that it doesn't overpower everything like boiling crab can do at times.  Less tourists and families, so that's a plus too."}
{"text":"THE BEST casual restaurant in Vegas! Outstanding food, excellent service, I have nothing bad to say about the joint. I am a local & this is my new favourite place to chow down in the 702!  Warning to girlie men and the faint of heart... The food here IS spicy, ask for a sample before you order a couple pounds of seafood and wimp out because you can't handle the heat.  I LOVE THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"Sooo good. First time eating at a Hot N Juicy and must say I will def be coming back. Service is a bit slow, but the food makes it worth it. We ordered the hot n juicy mild seasoning on the crawfish, shrimp, and crab legs and it was delicious. Mild was a bit spicy so I wouldn't go spicier than that."}
{"text":"Ordered the mixture of shrimp and crawfish, this is definitely better than boiling crab. I liked the food a lot but not so much the service. I'll just pick up next time and eat at home"}
{"text":"The food was good.  Had the garlic butter shrimp the first day.  Great taste... but heavy on the garlic.   Unfortunately, the waitress forgot all about me after I ate.  Waited 20 minutes- waived and tried to get their attention.  Finally had to go to the front and ask.  I liked the food through and decided to go back.  Second day they brought me a delicious looking bag of shrimp.  Said they would be right back with the setup... bucket, gloves, bib, lemons, etc.  Never came back.  Stared at my shrimp for 15 minutes.  When to the front and asked for a bucket.  Waited 10 more minutes.  As I walked out the door, the waitress yelled after me that she was just getting my bucket.  Food is a 4, Service is a 1.  Will never return."}
{"text":"Yummy! Prefacing remarks : we did take out, and we're not sure if we got what we ordered? Or if we didn't know what we ordered!   It's a lazy, rainy Sunday in Henderson and we've been meaning to try this place out. We weren't really in the mood to go out, but alas! Hot n Juicy does takeout!   We ordered a pound of crawfish hot n juicy sauce spicy, a pound of crawfish Cajun style spicy, a pound of snow crab legs in butter garlic mild, and a pound of king crab legs in butter garlic mild.  We're pretty sure the crab legs butter garlic mild turned into hot n juicy spicy somehow...So there's that for miscommunication.   But the food we got was super flavorful & tasty! The sauces are finger lick inducing, & don't forget to rub your meat in the sauce!  The boyfriend ate the crawfish and said it was possibly boiled/steamed to long because the meat was somewhat mushy (but this could be because we had takeout).  That's pretty much the only complaint we had.   Pleased with what we got, & we will go back :)  Also! Takeout tip! They provide you with a plastic table top cover - so thankful. They also offer you gloves. & they have crab crackers (the metal tool, not like a cracker you eat) for sale!"}
{"text":"Everything was hot and tasted fresh! You get a bib and gloves because it definitely gets messy but completely worth it! 10/10 would recommend!"}
{"text":"The fresh crawfish in the Cajun sauce were wonderful. The etouffe was pretty good.  There was no beer on tap as they were cleaning the taps.  The servers were marginal at best.  Probably won't be back.  F"}
{"text":"The food is excellent and the service is always awesome!! Ask for server Jessica...she will take good care of you!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious, the motto \"pinch and suck\" are very practical here. I've ordered the craw fish and shrimp with lemon pepper medium hotness very yummy, and also the hot and juicy special sauce spicy! Wow very spicy but delicious. The levels of hotness are greater than at other places so try medium first or be brave and go for the spicy or extra spicy.  Tried the dungenous crab legs, not bad, unfortunately the sauce doesn't get soked in to the the legs like it does to the shrimp and the crawfish. But over all its all yummy!"}
{"text":"The hot and juicy sauce mild with any of the shrimp or craw fish, mild is spicy enough! The spice index here is much higher than other Cajun places. You will be eating with your hands so wash'em before and after!  The only thing that bothers me is the amount of trash this place generates per table . And also they use styrophome."}
{"text":"My aunt and cousin are FANS of this spot and said we HAD to check it out!  We ordered the Shrimp, Crawfish, Crab legs, Raw Oysters, Sweet Potato Fries and Chicken wings.  Needless to say it was all devoured.  We are fans and will definitely hit this spot again when we are in town.  Service was hit and miss.  Greeted, Check. Drinks, Check.  Ordered food.  Check.  But, when our meal was complete it took a bit too long to get our check.  Then I had to walk to the register to pay my bill."}
{"text":"Love. Love. Love this place. I honestly think it's better than Boiling Crab, you don't have to deal with the ridiculously long wait time, and it's cheaper here. I didn't try their crawfish, which they are known for, as I think it's too much of a hassle for such a small portion of meat. We did get the snow crabs (so tender), the shrimp (big chunk of meat), clams (juicy), and the corn. The corn is really good, being soaked up in all the goodness of juice/sauce. Then combine all that salty food, and down it with Corona and lime, that's a damn good meal!"}
{"text":"Hoy n Juicy is sooooo yummy! The service is always great as well. Marc was awesome! Very talkative and attentive with my family :) !!!"}
{"text":"WOW this place. Easily one of the most delicious places on earth. If you don't like it here I feel so sorry for you.  We get the hot shrimp and crab. Wow wow. I don't even want to write this review because I'm thinking about it and it's making me so hungry.  It's seriously heavenly. There's no other way to describe it. So so so so sooooo good. Pretty much the best shrimp \"dish\" on earth.  It's expensive that's why I don't go often, sadly.  This place deserves more than 5 starts. I'd give it 10/5  I adore the sauce on the white rice.  My mouth is watering just thinking of the food.  This is the place to eat."}
{"text":"I really didn't think this place was that bad. From my experience there, I don't think the over all yelp ratings accurately refects the restaurant. The service was excellent. We were constantly asked how our food was, did anyone get our drinks, has anyone gotten our orders. We went on a Friday night and there wasn't a wait at all, we were seated right away and served immediately. I ordered 1lb of shrimp along with sweet potato fries and a cup of rice. The rice was a little hard and cold, but the sweet potato fries and hotnjuicy sauce on the shrimps were delicious. I would suggest they should add some more garlic to their hotnjuicy sauce though."}
{"text":"First the problems with this place.  It gets to hot in the building.  They need to turn the AC on or lower the temp.  Second when it is busy, and this place gets busy the service can be slow.  Now the good stuff, everything else.  Every waiter I have had has been very friendly.  I don't order the crawfish.  I think they are too much work.  I actually prefer the shrimp.  You get more meat, I feel the flavor of the sauce is better on the shrimp, and I feel they are easier to peel.  I also like pretty much everything else they have. I will say that not all Hot N Juicy's are created equal.  The one in Fountain Valley California sucks."}
{"text":"Probably the simplest yelp review I will ever do.  The atmosphere is fun and come with friends you're bound to enjoy yourself in it's generally loud chow area when it's packed.  Most often than not I just come here for shrimp.  Generally their sauces are good, but I'm a Cali kid and so my heart has a soft spot for BC.  3 of 5"}
{"text":"Been here, it's ok! It's no Boiling Crab & the taste will stay in your system for a whole week so beware!"}
{"text":"This place was just like boiling crab...and we must have gone at a good time because we didn't have to wait for a table.    I had raw oysters for the first time and they were really good!  Other than that, I had the usual pound of shrimp and sweet potato fries.  MMMM, so good but we smelled like GARLIC for 24 hours!!!"}
{"text":"My friends and I are big fans of Boiling Crab and Boat House, so we were excited to find a Cajun seafood restaurant when we were in Vegas. I'm totally over eating at buffets when in Vegas because I can no longer justify paying $40+ for AYCE when I can't even eat a lot anymore. I did notice that some Yelpers have mentioned seeing this place on Man Vs. Food. I guess I must have missed that episode, but I did see Adam's picture framed on the wall there!  I ended up eating the shrimp, dungeness crab, and crawfish with mild garlic butter sauce. I usually order mild whenever I eat at Boat House or Boiling Crab, which is the perfect amount of spicy for me, but here at Hot N Juicy Crawfish, mild was a little too hot for me to handle. Our server did warn us that their food was a little bit spicier than other places, so I should have better prepared myself. It took a while for our party to finish the food because everyone's mouths were on fire, but we won the battle against the food, even if it was only mild!"}
{"text":"Fun! Mom, Dad with a 12 year old loved it! We ordered a pound of crawfish to share and the staff was more than happy to give us a tutorial on how to properly eat a crawfish. We each ordered a Po'Boy and it was MORE than enough food!  Super friendly staff!"}
{"text":"I think I have tried all the boil places in town.   Hot N' Juicy is by far my favorite.  The Hot N' Juicy sauce medium is my go to.   I usually get shrimp and snow crab with a piece of corn on the cob and a potato in the bag.  Obviously they have crawfish too and king crab and blue crab.  They also have chicken strips and fries for the kiddos. Plus a few other fried options.  They are always busy but still have good service for the most part.   They all work together and help each other  out.  If I could change one thing it would be to put lids on the drink cups because outr hands get slippery with all that sauce and having the lid will help prevent a big mess.  Although we  didn't spill I was worried the whole time my 5 year old was going to spill his drink all over himself and me.  But the food is so good and in my opinion worth the $100+ we spend every time we go we eat there."}
{"text":"Good food, and great service. There's no complaints here. So I'll add this to the list of \"will do again\"."}
{"text":"I liked the casual atmosphere and the staff was super friendly! I also like all things Cajun! I sampled the Cajun Calamari (Good) and the Shrimp PoBoy (Good) with Cajun fries. And for dessert the Battered Brownie bites (Good) Everything was ok, nothing elevated. I need to come back and give them another chance and try the Etouffee and their Crawfish boil - that might be the sweet spot."}
{"text":"if you are ever in the Las Vegas area, i would recommend you trying this place out if you are craving some crawfish or crabs. This is the place that the man vs food guy visited when he was in vegas for a food challenge. this place is sooo much better than boiling crab. the crawfish is awesome here. it can get a little spicy. the good thing is, your hands won't smell like garlic for a week."}
{"text":"We had lunch here at hot n juicy before we left vegas and its was delicious. I recommend it if u want great service ,good food and good price. The restaurant was very clean n the staff are very friendly."}
{"text":"I have been to the other location and although this location is more hip, I still prefer the one row the street.  Food is good, service is good but still not the same feel."}
{"text":"Based on the food, I'm giving Hot n Juicy a 3. Service was fine and prices are reasonable. But overall I'm not a huge fan of the food. We ordered a pound of crawfish, shrimp, extra corn. Not bad not good. Beware that you and all your belongings that enter Hot n Juicy will continue to smell like Hot n Juicy for quite a while!"}
{"text":"ive been going to this place since the week it opened, and of course since i am \"asian\" i needed to eat rice with my food so i would actually bring in my own rice until i finally was able to convince the owner to put rice on the menu and she DID.   I watch this place grow so busy over the last several years now and im so happy for the owners that this place became a huge success.   I want to make a very true  and clear point here because its just very dissappointing to find out to hear what people will do for vengeance to make a fabulous place like this shut down.  To the person who loves to spread false information and to put it on this on the news is completely outright wrong! and secondly karma is a bitch cause you messed up in the first place...hate it to say it to the folks but this place is NOT going to shut down.  There will ALWAYS be dissatisfied customers no matter what! no matter what! Honestly,  this place is not gonna make everyone happy, i mean, what business out there does???? this IS america people! we love to complain, and all the better, we loooove to sue each others ass off!!   All I can tell you is that since ive been coming here along with all the waaaaay tooooo many people i referred this place to and i rarely ever got a bad response, and only a few times i did get one its because they were either 1) don't eat seafood 2) extremely fickle picky eaters.  but this place is outstanding, and consistent, its always freaking busy! so the customer service is not always gonna be 110% on top of things, your not coming here for superb service, your coming here for seafood cajun style and  of course, if you like it \"SPICY\". if your a customer and you demand perfect food along with perfect service go take yourself to a 5 star rated michelin awarded restaurant cause theres a few here in vegas, and spend your $500  + worth of experiencing excellent dining.   Other than that,  ive said what i needed to say. Nonetheless, hot and juicy, when it comes to great seafood and spice and BLUECRABS, you never fail me, you just make me and all the rest of your fans from vegas, l.a., the bay, and everyone else from all over,coming back for MORE!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"On my Man vs Food tour in Vegas I visited this place I must say don't let the plastic bags that they bring the steamables in fool you. The food is good. I ordered the snow crab legs and the crawfish. I had the spicy level on my crablegs and let me tell you it's hot, and I like spicy. The Crablegs were good the crawfish was good too I just liked the crablegs better. When I go back to Vegas I'll be going back. The atmosphere is fine I didn't pay much attention to it because I was thee for the crawfish and Crablegs."}
{"text":"It was my first time eating crawfish, and I thought the unique Hot n Juicy seasoning was so good. I simply ordered 1lb of crawfish, mild and I wish I had ordered the medium. Our waiter said the medium can be pretty spicy but as someone with a decent spice tolerance, I felt like the mild did not have enough of a kick. The add-ins, like potatoes and corn, are fantastic to have to help fill you up. I also ordered mozzarella sticks but they were nothing special. The service was fantastic as we came in with a party of ten, were seated within 15 minutes, and were able to go Dutch in the bill. Our server was very patient with splitting the bill even when we saw his face fall a little hearing that we wanted to pay separate lol."}
{"text":"Dear miss manners:   I was invited to this place to eat crawfish. I had never tried crawfish before so I was not aware of the intense labor that is required to eat these little creatures. But it's ok because at the end you are rewarded with lots of flavor.  It was so messy I had to wear a bib, and the only way to eat them was using nothing but your fingers! I had to put aside everything my mother had taught me on table etiquette.   I have to admit that I had a wonderful time. This place is awesome. The food the service and the ambiance were exceptionally good. Everyone seems to be having a wonderful time! Can't wait to come back and try other things. Like the shrimp the crab legs or the oysters!   My question is.... Is it bad when you like something so much to the point of licking the juices of the fingers? Even if the fingers are those of your friends?"}
{"text":"The food was good. The service was even better ,  the servers Aubry and Gianna were really nice and cheerful young ladies . We left a big mess on the table but the experience was enjoyable! I will return and I do recommend!!!"}

{"text":"Great food, great service. Thanks Jared for an amazing experience...and happy birthday, dad!"}
{"text":"Awesome! Ordered a pound of garlic butter shrimp with mild spice, and a pound of Creole crawfish with hot spice. To my surprise I found it very flavorful but not spicy next time I will go hot. Also ordered sweet tater fries, fried shrimp and calamari. All pretty good. The shrimp by far my favorite. The staff is friendly and attentive. They offered us bibs....I regretfully said \" no thank you \". Don't be me....take the bib! Especially if your an immature woman child like myself and have way to much fun playing with the deceased ( yet delicious ) crayfish claws whilst doing my best Zoidberg impression \" everywhere it went \". Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"So I guess my review my fall short as this was my first seafood place I have been to in Vegas and the first time I ever tried oysters so I can't compare to other places.  But I am now obsessed with oysters and I love love love their seasoning choices. We got the hot n spicy everything but I loved it and can't wait to try more! The king crab legs were huge and full of meat! The shrimp and oysters were our fav! Didn't do the crawfish as I find them pointless cause there's little to no meat. The others I was with got some fried fish basket things, I'm not big on fried seafood so I didn't try it but they loved that as well. Service seemed friendly and prompt. Can't wait to go back! Yum yum and yummm!"}
{"text":"Went tonight for the first time. I got the lemon pepper and baby spice snow crab legs, and my boyfriend got the crawfish in mild louisiana style. Every thing was amazing, but the mild was pretty spicy!!!! Like runny nose spicy! The only reason I give 3 stars is because we both got sick when we got home.....maybe it was the all the spiciness? But the food and service was excellent!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Didn't take long for us to be seated and have our order taken. Our waitress explained the menu to us and the food was great!"}
{"text":"Went to this location in Tempe after trying locations in SOCAL & this is definitely better prepared & flavor than the imposters in the valley for sure.  I came to this one for a bday & had a fun. A bonus was the beer special on Sun/Mon during the NFL season. Buy one beer get the next for a penny. Yup I said a penny. So good.  Can't wait to go back for more. :)"}
{"text":"I have had this kind of yummy seafood prep before in Cali & loved the concept. We tried to come in 2x on weekends & they had a 2 hour wait both times (not a game night). I know CRAZY but it's new & this gave me hope that its beyond yummy. So we cruised in for a week day lunch & we both tried shrimp with diff sauces & both liked it. The shrimp were not deveined so be warned. The fries were good, crispy & seasoned well. They had local beers from Four Peaks on tap & I love me some Peach so that great. The staff work in a group so that's kind of nice because you can ask anyone for a refill of H2O etc. The prices are on par but we won't be back again until the shiny newness wear off. A 2 hour wait for shrimp that don't knock your socks off is just way too long.  FYI... I tried to post a tip about the wait both times it was removed by HnJ. Shame on you HnJ. It wasn't negative just a fact. So you lose a star for being douches."}
{"text":"It's a mixed feeling here.  I have tried this place at least 5 times so here is what I conclude:  Shrimps - I will start off with the good stuff.  This restaurant offers high quality (not live, but still high quality) shrimps that stays consistent!  Strongly recommend.  Clams - They don't always have it but if they do, they are typically live.  Hot N Juicy beats AngryCrab on this one.  Lets hope this continues.  Oysters - If you have read other reviews then you probably already get the idea.  There are some issues with Hot N Juicy's oyster.  It's not because they are not fresh, it's just that their oysters are not stored or/and prepared properly.  I am an oyster lover and for the last 10 years, this is the only restaurant that I will get a diarrhea after having oysters.  STAY AWAY from their oysters if you are on a date or going to a movie later!  Veggie - No veggie here...not sure why.  End up going to AC several times for this reason.  Sausage - Not the best but oh well, it's at least close to average.  Beers - Very little selections.  Service - Great service here, never had any issue."}
{"text":"Great place to eat some delicious crab legs and shrimp with all the fixings. This place has never disappointed me. I can easily spend over $100 on a few pounds of crab legs it is worth every penny. Just don't be afraid to get your hands dirty."}
{"text":"umm...you call this a crawfish spot?! I came here on Halloween with some friends. We wanted to take a break from the hotel/casino food. Arrived around 5pm and was seated immediattely. Yeah..it was empty hahaha..  We were about to order and the waitress tells us they are out of CRAWFISH! WTF.....okay..So we asked for Clams...out of CLAMS..asked what they had. They had Shrimp. Ordered 4 lbs of shrimp. The marinate/sauce sucks..no flavor at all.. Had way better. Guess this place didnt live up to the hype"}
{"text":"Would definitely have to say that while it is not the biggest place it is definitely a pleasant place to dine in. The food was great and came in a timely manner. The food was good and reasonably priced, would have to say that overall I was pleased with my visit."}
{"text":"My boyfriend saw this place on Man Vs. Food and it is only about a 5 minute drive from the strip.   Not bad. We arrived at 12:30PM ready for seafood. Yet, we were seated, given menus, then as we attempted to order we were informed that they are not currently serving crawfish. The item they are known for! UNACCEPTABLE! We came here for the crawfish, thats what we wanted, so why would we order something else. The waitress expanded that they just received a shipment so their crawfish are frozen. First off, hearing frozen was a huge turn off. I live in the San Francisco Bay Area so our seafood here is FRESH. Yet I had to remind myself that Vegas is in the desert so fresh seafood here is unlikely.   We rolled our eyes and blew the joint. I swear I would be back but for the rest of the day I was getting puppy eyes from the honey so I agreed to give them a second try and attempt dinner.  We arrived again at 5:30 and we were seated after 10 minutes. We ordered a pound of Hot & Juicy Special in Medium and one pound of shrimp in Garlic Butter medium and a side of sweet potato fries. First off there is not one positive thing that I can recall about the fries so I would recommend ordering a bowl of rice instead. Yes, order rice over fries. I never thought I would recommend that to anyone. Ever.  My favorite flavor was the Hot & Juicy! It was packed with flavor and mighty tasty! The Garlic Butter was good too! I would both order them again. The heat levels here though are a little off, if you want hot, order medium, etc. I would beware the extra spicy!   The place got pretty crowed around 6:20 and I was happy we arrived fairly early. The service here is lagging. You have to notify your waiter(ess) if you want more water. They don't really pay attention the details.   I would go back if I lived there and needed a crawfish fix, but on my next Vegas trip or any after I will not be visiting Hot and Juicy. It was good, but it wasn't THAT good.   (I took off a star for not having crawfish when I went initially FYI)  OH and yes, my paws smelled 2 days after. The amount of soap didn't matter. The order sinks in! Kinda yucky.  Happy ripping off the heads of crawfish!   (="}
{"text":"This was one of the best seafood places I've been to for crawfish! It was absolutely good! I ordered 2 lbs of crawfish and also got a potato and corn that was in mild hot&juicy sauce. The flavor was very satisfying and just made me want more. Waitresses there were quite friendly and quick with the food. I liked how it was easy to eat as in the tables had plastic on them for quick clean up and they gave me a plastic bib and there was lots of napkins if I needed any. I would come back anytime again!"}
{"text":"My favorite place I love this establishment every time I go here the food is perfect. I love the fact that the seafood is always fresh I'm never disappointed when I go here. Although the serving staff could be a little more attentive with the customers."}
{"text":"Great place for seafood, the mild original sauce is a bit spicy, we had the shrimp, it comes in a plastic bag with the heads on. we ordered a corn and it's in the sauce which makes it awesome.They will give you a sample of the crayfish if you ask,  I'm not positive but I think you get more than a pound when you place your order, [it's sold by the pound.] We also tried the butter garlic sauce, good taste. Our waitress talked us out of the medium spice, if it's your first time order mild.  It was pretty spicy... the ca-gin fries are a bit spicy too.   The second time we went wasn't as spicy but still good  They'll give you a bib and gloves if you want.  They also have a small dish you can ask for on the side that has salt and pepper, which you squeeze lemon juice that makes another winner dipping sauce."}
{"text":"OK, been to LV a few years and always had friends tell me to try this place.... Who want to fight and eat crayfish, after you work the shell off you get a tiny piece..... They should have named this place HOT & JUICY SEAFOOD!  We checked it out, they also serve Shrimp with the head on, mussels, green and black, crab, snow, dungeness, and king. they also have Maine Lobster.  We ordered the shrimp $11.99/#  with the original sauce medium.... Thanks to our waitress she talked us first timers into the mild, it was plenty spicy, we added the cagin fries, and a corn.  we also tried the butter garlic with the cagin spice, hard to tell the difference but you could taste the additional butter and garlic.  Staff was awesome, you'll get a bib and gloves if you want.  the first time they also gave us salt and pepper which she said to squeeze lemon wedges to give us an additional sauce to dip our shrimp into. It's a hands on meal, you need to peel the heads and shells off the shrimp but it's fun and worth the effort.   We went back a second time, the mild wasn't as spicy as our first experience, but we'll be back for more..."}
{"text":"Went to dinner last night and got seated fairly quick but our whole dining experience was a disaster. Our server came by and asked us what we wanted for drinks and we wanted root beer but she said no we don't have it ...fine, we wanted water. We also told her that we are ready to order too but her face looks irritated like she  doesn't want to take our order, but did it anyway with an attitude. We got our food but wrong order one of our dishes, annoyed. Went ahead and ate our food but she only checked up on us just once and can't locate her to get our gloves and extra lemon peppers, so we went and serve ourselves. Food , I think the chef is on vacation...it lacks flavors. I left a bitter flavor in my mouth with the whole experience. I really couldn't sit there any longer left and let my husband took care of the bill. Sorry,  I will not return to this location."}
{"text":"It is what it is. Spicy creole-Asian flavors +crab legs/crawfish. the crab is good, not a fan of crawfish, but friends love it. The food comes in a plastic bag filled with corn, potatoes and juices. This place has received a lot of attention on the Food Network.  It's definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"It was really great when it opened but every time we've come since, the flavor and quality has gone down  The crawfish is very salty and the service is very inconsistent  We came in and more then half the restaurant was empty.  We went in to get a table first and the host refused to seat us until half the party arrived, even though I told him repeatedly I was ordering for everyone and they were just parking.  I understand policy but common sense people!  Update to my review from earlier this evening.  Myra a manager came out after reading our review and asked for feedback. I definitely appreciate a business willing to listen to their customers.  The servers were also super friendly and helpful tonight as well.  I hope they're able to maintain their consistency and service.  We loved it when it opened and we want to love it again  Thanks Myra!"}
{"text":"Didn't know that this place had opened up more locations around Vegas. Pretty much almost identical to the original place except way bigger. Way bigger. Don't think you'll ever have to wait in line at this place. Food is just as good."}
{"text":"I came here two years ago when on leave from Iraq.  Loved it.  And then after I came back from Iraq I was pleasantly surprised to see Man vs. Food come and eat here!  Good for them (both the show and the restaurant!).    Coming for CES I wanted to come back here.  Came on a Friday night and the place was packed.  Had to wait 30 minutes.    When they sat me down, the menu looked identical to what it was 2 years ago.  They told me because of the new opening of a 2nd Hot 'N Juicy in Washington (D.C. or state?) the shrimp was buy one and get one free.  Sure, why not?  So I ordered 1 lb of crawdad, 1 lb of crab legs and 1 lb of shrimp which turned into 2 lbs of shrimp.    Got the Hot 'N Juicy flavor which is a combination of all their flavors together.  You get four different flavors to choose from (check the website's menu) or you can just combine them all.  So I did this and asked for extra garlic.  And I emphasized a lot of garlic.  And I chose medium as to how spicy.  I remember the 1st time I went I ordered either the spicey or extra spicey and after 2 lbs of crawdad my mouth and innards were burning.  So I decided on medium this time.  The tables you sit down at are covered with a plastic sheet.  You get a bib to eat all your food with also.  The food comes out in a plastic bag that holds your food and the juice of whatever flavor you chose.  While eating your food, you crack and open whatever it is you're eating directly on the table.  After you're down, the waiters just come and wrap up the entire thing with that plastic sheet and voila!  A brand new clean table is ready.  I thought this was so cool the 1st time I came here so I made a complete mess of myself and the table.  Food came out and I started to chow down.  There was a ton of garlic in my bags, it was outstanding.  They forgot my bib and half-way through my 1st bag I asked for my bib.  One of the waitresses actually tied it around my neck for me 'cause my hands were already all messy.  I laughed as she tied it for me!  That's service!  Food was even better than I last remembered.  Shrimp was completely on point being moderate to big sized.  Choose snow crab for my legs and they were great.  And of course the crawdad was excellent.  After 4 lbs of food the spices got to me again.  Will have to go with mild sauce next time-sigh, I'm just getting old and can't quite handle my spicy foods like I use to.  So overall Hot 'N Juicy actually improved since I last came here-amazing.  A definite have to visit if you love crawdad."}
{"text":"Me and my girl went here on a Friday night. Not a very long wait and got our food fast, except for the snow crab which was forgotten.  After tracking down the waitress, we finally got out snow crabs and they were comped due to the screw up.  That's the way it should be so we will come back soon and see how things go the second time around  The seafood in a bag of juice is kinda weird, but better than I thought it would be, so I give then a big thumbs up"}
{"text":"Another Hot N Juicy visit, another great experience.  Customer service has always been top notch. Food is DELICIOUS!   Wanted to get crab but market price is getting kinda out of control. but can't hold that against HnJ.   We shall be back ;)"}
{"text":"It's been a while since we ate here. Been craving some shrimp and clams. we normally get the butter garlic shrimp and clams with baby spice. their seafood there is so tasty. next time we gonna add on the corn . have that soak up some of that sauce and boys oh boy, tops it off perfectly."}
{"text":"I had never heard of hot n juicy but the ladies I was with were obsessed so we had to come in.  It was a Saturday night and the place wasn't too crowded. There were people at almost every table but it was only a couple of minutes before we were seated.   They have plastic on all the tables. They give you a bucket, bib, and gloves because it gets pretty messy.   I ordered a pound of shrimp with two small red potatoes. I had hot and juicy seasoning in spicy. My shrimp had eyes, ears, tails, and all that good stuff. As delicious as it was having to peel all the shrimp was time consuming and annoying. Sometimes you just wanna hurry and get to your food. The peeling slowed me down but I still enjoyed the flavor of the shrimp and potatoes.   The prices here are great. They have other choices of seafood as well.   I would return but it's not a number one priority. When in the mood for seafood and I don't mind a little extra work I'd stop in."}
{"text":"this is the place to go when u got a sinus infection or just open up your pores with some good cajun seafood . even though i usually just get the fried shrimp basket with the cajun fries i do seldom put those gloves on and go to work literally"}
{"text":"I love Hot n Juicy, first time I had it this past summer my girlfriend took me to the location on Spring Mountain.  Just recently moved to Las Vegas and found that there was a new opened location close by to where we had moved!   Excited my boyfriend and I decided to order some for take out.   Flavors were great and the crawfish was yummy! Loved everything about it, but knocking off one star because we didn't get any gloves to eat it with!   It might have been my boyfriends fault for not checking the bag and asking If there were gloves, I mean I know anyone wouldn't really want to get that messy with their hands while eating hot n juicy.  I also called and asked if they provide gloves when ordering take out, the girl over the phone said that you have to ask for gloves when you order over the phone, so make sure you ask for gloves!    If you forget some gloves, just drive down to Walgreens and get your own box, that's what we did lol"}
{"text":"Came here with a few girlfriends for lunch, but it wasn't our first time.  We've been to the old location near Decatur.  Everything came out delicious and super spicy! I love the shrimp and sausage and there sauce was perfect blend of spices and savory seasoning.  Must try when in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Just waited 10 minutes and hostess walked past me twice without saying a word. I'm pretty sure this place does not have open seating. Just a terrible hostess. She could have said \"I'll be right with you.\"    Trust the other reviews. Avoid this place until management hires people who want to work."}
{"text":"Love their lemon pepper & hot n juicy shrimp. Good size restaurant only waited 20mins for seating."}
{"text":"Clients took me here and I always heard it was good, I'm glad they suggested it.  They go all the time so they ordered for us.  Pretty simple concept.  I never had crawfish in my life and I tried them.  They are okay, but seem like a lot of work.  I prefer the shrimp myself.  The flavors that they toss the seafood in is just awesome.  Lots of garlic and spice goodness.  Great when they add a potato and corn into the bag so they too soak up the flavors.  A little messy, so you want to go with people you are comfortable with and takes time to eat your food, so don't go when you are in a rush!  Only thing that could see being an issue for some if you are weird like me, the shrimp are in their shell with the heads on, so you have to take the heads off and they are not deviened, so that could be a little gross to think about.  I ate a whole bag to myself and I didn't get sick, nothing to worry about.   Prices are by the pound, so it can add up!    Quite messy, so just be ready and use all the paper towels they give you.  I would also bring lots of gum for the garlic breath after too!"}
{"text":"Ridiculous! Ordered over the phone for pick up today... of 4 lbs of shrimp... calamari and fries. The girl on the phone read my order back to me, asked for my name twice, she gave me a total price of around $80, and said that my order would be ready in about 30 minutes. Got to the place, arrived about 35 minutes after calling. Got to the counter to pay and they said they don't have an order under my name! Then 15 minutes later they miraculously found my order??? For crying out loud... you don't mess with a hungry person"}
{"text":"Loved this place. Have been to vegas numerous times but this was our first visit to this restaurant. Great shrimp, we got 4lb of it with their house sauce and we couldn't get enough.  Crawfish was tiny and not my favorite by far, but shrimp and crab legs I'm still craving a week later.  Waitresses are friendly and it wasn't too crowded on the day we went so we really enjoyed it. Would definitely come back next time in Vegas."}
{"text":"To: Hot and Juicy Crawfish, Emily, Mady,              My wife and I like to frequent the Mill Avenue venue for our Friday night ritual. Our Fridays' typically include bar hopping and walking the strip until we settle down at one of our favorite restaurants. This Friday, however, was not typical. Our evening started with the perusing vendors at the Tempe Arts Festival, trying to fight the hustle and bustle of the crowds and closed streets. We took cover at one of your competitors and imbibed a couple of tasty beverages and consumed some delectable eats. With several destinations in-between we ended up landing at Hot and Juicy Crawfish.  It is rare that you feel a percussion so magnificent you feel your own heart beating in its absence, but this is Hot and Juicy Crawfish.  Your Family, Emily and Mady were the highlights of a spectacular dining experience. They were awesome and personable. It is quite a rare spectacle that you visit a restaurant were the employees are allowed to display their personality. Upmost, I commend Emily and Mady on a level of personable service far above your competition.      Thank,             Melba and David."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating crawfish... and I must say that it's a lot of work to get to a small amount of meat but it is fun and messy. They cover the table with a plastic tablecloth and have complimentary crawfish bibs to wear to protect your clothes. I think it's worthwhile trying the crawfish at least once!   We tried a few other things from the menu including snow crab (this was awesome), blue crab (skip this altogether) king crab, shrimp (definitely order this!), sausage, corn, cajun fries, potato and one of my personal favorites, the étouffée! The sausage comes in sliced pieces and I found it delicious to add to the étouffée which is much like a gumbo.   We came here twice. The place is constantly packed to capacity, the parking lot full and a waiting list to get a table but it's well worth the wait trust me!"}
{"text":"Whoa. Just whoa. I had lunch with a friend here and my stomach was feeling a little funky to begin with. First mistake.   Service was really neglectful. We had to ask to get our beverage refilled 4 times (we actually only got one refill). Also, we didn't get gloves and it was impossible to flag down someone.   The \"hot and juicy\" sauce is disgusting. It's ok (thought kinda overwhelming) going down and horrendous when you're REEKING of it for two days after. That's NOT how Louisianians eat their crawfish.   The only reason this place didn't get a 1 is because of the peel-and-eat shrimp. They were fantastic and reasonably priced.  If I ever go back, I know not to expect much for the service, order two drinks from the beginning, ditch the sauce and get only shrimp."}
{"text":"Our 1st time going to this restaurant we were greeted very friendly into our table right away by staff member. Our waitress was so helpful with our order for our 1st there we were impress. We brought our sister & brother in law & they fell in love with this restaurant & they are local. The seafood is DELICIOUS!! Every time we come to Las Vegas we have to eat here. Keep up the good service & great food."}
{"text":"Great crawboil place. There is NO comparison to the hot n Juicy sauce. It's so addicting. I like the snow crab and crawfish (not frozen). The spice level starts making your nose runs at about a mild. I'm not big on spicy so baby spice is as far as I go. Sausage and corn are delicious. Goes perfectly with a beer. This location and the one in Henderson are less touristy. Good service every time. Overall I had a great experience and I'll definitely be back within the next two weeks."}
{"text":"Omgggg so! I kept hearing about these places,them n bc. In Vegas I stopped by, paid $11 a lb for hot n juicy special. 2lb minimum n it came w corn n potatoe. In total $26 bc I added sausage which was worth it. $26 was super steep bc of the name I suppose. In Texas it's the same quality just not as expensive. The food was HOT N JUICY. for ppl who like spicy,get spicy not mild. I came home from Vegas later that night n my bf made me bathe bc I smelled like it lol. It's true it stays on you but yummy. At least go once. At first I was pissed bc some of the fishtails were small."}
{"text":"When my friend told me a \"Hot N Juicy Crawfish\" opened up on Eastern Avenue, I was thrilled!  I've always wanted to go but the other locations were a bit far for me.  So, me, my boyfriend and a friend of mine decided to have lunch here after church yesterday. I'm very happy we chose this place!  We were greeted and seated right away.  The staff was very friendly and attentive, always making sure we were being taken care of and had everything we needed.  Being that it was our first time, the waitress kindly explained the menu to us and told us all about the sauces and their intensity.  We ordered 2 dozen oysters and each had 2 pounds of crawfish as well.  The oysters were very clean and a good size.  With a little lemon juice and cocktail sauce, they were pretty tasty.  I ordered the crawfish with the Hot n Juicy \"mild\" sauce.  I was told that if I liked spicy that I should \"kick it down a notch\" because their sauces are one step up.  They weren't kidding.  The mild sauce had a nice bite to it.  I suggest if you don't like anything spicy, order \"less than mild\" sauce.  The bag of crawfish also comes with a potato and small corn cobb.  We didn't wait long for our food and began our crawfish adventure.  Before digging into my bag of hot n juicy goodness, I made sure to put on the recommended gloves and my plastic bib.  Once suited up, I opened the bag, pulled out one of the spicy crustaceans and went to town.  The crawfish were just like the name says, hot n juicy!  The mild sauce was a bit spicy, but nothing I couldn't handle. I actually like a little fire to my meals.  The crawfish were easy to peel,but very messy.  Thank goodness for the gloves and paper towels!  I devoured most of the bag, leaving just  a small amount on the bottom.  I liked the Hot N Juicy sauce, which is a mixture of all of the sauces on the menu, but I would like to try some of the other sauces on their own. All in all, I was not disappointed.  My friends and I really enjoyed our lunch at Hot N Juicy Crawfish and will definitely be back again real soon!"}
{"text":"I love how hot n juicy is location on this side of town. I could get my shrimp fix without driving to spring mountain. The hostess made my experience very welcoming. We wanted a booth and the hostess made sure we got a booth, even though there were other customers ahead of us (give or take that it was a giant party waiting for more tables to be available). The food came in a fast pace & the waitress was attentive and very nice."}
{"text":"One of the best places to have crawfish,  shrimp and crab.. this was our first existence and our server Shelby, along with the additional staff, was great and accommodates us throughout our experience.   I can say that this place has customers for life,  we are already planning our next visit.  Recommendation: get feet  (forgot the full name) Just wanted to say thank you to Shelby and the staff for a great experience."}
{"text":"Came here for my mother's birthday, and had an okay time. The server Danielle was great she knew just what we wanted and she did not disappoint us at all. The food however, was disappointing. The Dungeness crab was not good. It was over cooked, and served by the pound, but the body of the crab is so heavy we barely got any meat with the 2lbs we ordered. The crawfish were okay if you like them. The only thing that was maybe worth coming back was the snow crab, mussels and the service."}
{"text":"Stopped by earlier to have a late dinner with my partna in crime, LiLy D.   I called them at almost 10:30pm to ask what time the kitchen closes. The guy said, \"we close at 11\" I said \"so it's ok if I come by in 5 minutes?\" he says, \"I'll let you slide\"  What we ordered: 1 lb shrimp Hot N Juicy Sauce Medium Spicy  1 lb shrimp Garlic Butter Sauce Spicy  1 lb crawfish Hot N Juicy Sauce Medium Spicy  1 order dinner rolls  3 Blue Moons  The food was hella good as usual. The employees were cool about us making them stay past their closing time. They never rushed us and even asked if we wanted more beers.   I noticed on the very bottom of the bill said something like \"WRITE A REVIEW ON YELP\"  I asked my waiter when they started having that on the receipt and he said it just started yesterday. That is effin AWESOME!!!"}
{"text":"We came to the new location last night to avoid the long wait at the original location. It still smells like construction in here. I love the decor.   We get seated and our server asks us what we would like to drink. I order a Blue Moon and she tells me they don't have their alcohol permit yet. WTF?!!  What we ordered:  2 Calamari 1 Fried Catfish Basket 2 lbs Shrimp Hot N Juicy medium 1 lb Shrimp Garlic Butter mild 1 Chicken Nuggets Basket 2 Chicken Wings Basket 1 Fried Shrimp 4 Bowls of Rice  The food was just as good as the original location. This is the first time I tried the Catfish and Calamari and they were both very good.   My only other complaint is that the chicken wings for the kids took a long time and were brought out a few minutes apart. They should have just brought out the orders together, cause one kid had to watch the other kid eat.   I will mos def come back to this location since there is no wait to be seated. Next time I will call first to make sure they have their alcohol permit."}
{"text":"Love!! The service is great, everyone helps out! The shrimps are my favorite thing to order, the sauces are all amazing, the only downside is you'll taste nothing but garlic for days!!! So worth it."}
{"text":"Was there on a busy night with an NHL game in town. Service was very slow. They messed up my drink order. The crawfish etouffee was greasy and overly hot from a temperature standpoint. Also light on actual crawfish. It took forever for them to bring the check. I love crawfish but have had it better every other place I've been."}
{"text":"Been to other 2 locations in town multiple times before first visit of this location. HUGE, BRIGHT sign. really hard to miss =X located next to East Ocean Dim Sum.   Clean and doesn't smell (yet) XD still new.   Service wise. Good and Bad. Their service for seating is bad. Before i had arrived, 2 other parties waited a decent amount of time, to be sitting, instead of standing and waiting. I'm not sure how long they waited but i waited at least 5-10 minutes before they asked, and they didnt ask until a 4th party showed up and stood there before anyone asked. The service in terms of at table, was great. My water cup was never empty (almost usually full, which is surprising for a Hot n Juicy), food came out pretty fast as well.   Food wise, since the last time i had Hot n Juicy (Spring Mtn & Valley View location), had ordered spicy. It was great but a little too much spicy, covering the natural seafood flavor, and my friend's stomach didnt like it too much XD. This time, decided to order medium instead. This locations medium, felt like a mild, if not a little lower. The sauce in the bag, seemed a little watery/diluted as well.   My mistake, i had ordered 3 lb of shrimp, medium, hot n juicy special, in 1 bag. Therefore, we couldnt really reach the sauce. Had asked the waitress for a side of sauce, which she told us they charge extra for sauce, and recommended to get like a potato or something for $0.60 and comes with the same amount of sauce. The sauce that came with the potato, seemed thicker and tastier (to me anyway) so that sauce disappeared quite fast XD.   Overall, good experience. Aside from maybe the spice level difference, it matches the other locations (always worrisome for me, that quality would be different between locations sometimes)   For those who like watching sports, TV's everywhere, doesnt matter which direction you sit. I sat facing the front of the store, and i still had maybe 3 tv's in my view."}
{"text":"Love this place but today the SERVICE  SUCKED! We walked in and a hostess asked how many. She left got our table ready and another server came up to help and sat the wrong people without asking us if we were first.  I complained and they said it will be a couple minutes! Looks like the servers and hostess have a lack of communication!! As for the food Love the lemon pepper seasoning is great. The Seafood came out early but the rest of our order didn't come out til we were just about done eating! Sweet Potato Fries are the best. I usually recommend this place but for this day the service was dissappointing."}
{"text":"Food is seasoned great!  Love the Lemon Pepper Shrimp sooooo flavorful with that kick of spice that keeps you eating more! Great Prices, Great Food.  Much better then Boiling Crab All around! Great to take your first date to see if they dont mind getting dirty! Crabs, and Crawfish Delicous! Initially ate here because was seen on Man Vs Food, and got hooked on the Flavor! Careful when you leave cause you'll definately smell like the YUMMY food you just ate!"}
{"text":"We were able to walk right in with no wait time. When we were first greeted by our  server, she informed us that they were out of over half their menu. No lobster, no mussels, no crab legs, the list goes on. We ended up ordering two different types of shrimp. We waited over 30 min for our food, and the place wasn't overly busy. Luckily, the food was amazing... Otherwise this would be a one star review. The service stunk and the bathrooms were filthy. Hoping it was just an off day, and it will be a different experience if we try it one more time."}
{"text":"The oysters great, the clams excellent, catfish outstanding.  The tartar sauce was one of the best.  Nereida, our server, pleasant  and was a great person.  Need to sit in her area.  Great job and a beautiful evening to sit on the patio for such great food."}
{"text":"Originally gave a 5 star for the amazing food (if you like spicy I recommend the hot n juicy spicy shrimp, it's out of this world!) but changed it to 3 after a few bad visits. However I have to give them a 5 once again because once I finally addressed my visits and how dissatisfied I was I was immediately contacted my management and they were very nice and respectful and made sure to listen to me and made sure to let me know my problems would be addressed. I really appreciate how fast they responded and didn't make excuses but instead understood my issues and said they would bring it up to be worked on. Their food really is so good! I usually stick to the shrimp because it's my favorite but there oysters and soft shell crab is another of my favorites!"}
{"text":"I love their hot and juicy crawfish flavor. Baby spice! Make sure to order some sausages with your crawfish!!! It's so good!"}
{"text":"My son and I decided to try this place for the first time.  The service was great and the food is really fresh and super delicious. My son loves it here. I will recommend it to my friends and family. And I will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"My friends often talk about \"Hot & Juicey\" I finally decided to try it out! I left there with my nose running and tears in my eyes due to the spices! Well worth it!!  My girl loved it and is already planning a second date back. My waitress was quick and extremely attentive and made it a wonderful overall experience! Thank you Angela! We will see you again real soon! We will make sure to ask for you! I will not only recommend the restaurant to all my friends in the industry but I will make sure they ask for you!! They all tip well!!!! Lol"}
{"text":"It's solid shrimp. Good oysters. Service was so-so."}
{"text":"Great service! Food was great! Everyone was awesome will defiantly be back soon, they also have my favorite beer SAPPORO witch is even more awesome everyone there is fast and friendly"}
{"text":"All time fave. Consistently good. I usually take out but I've dined in here twice and the service left a lot to be desired so I'll stick to taking out. The waitresses are inattentive and act like they are busy even when there are barely patrons there. It's almost like they're faking lol. Their hot n juicy special sauce is bangin!!! Crabs are fleshy and claws complete unlike other places. Their juicy hot is really hot so be careful with your spice level. Not a lot of parking in the teeny tight complex so pray to meet them on a slow day. The price matches the quality & quantity so I can't complain about sides like corn and potatoes being an add on. Will always stop by when I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"I came here on recommendation from a co-worker and I gotta say, it did not disappoint. For those of you coming from California as I am, this is basically the Boiling Crab of Vegas (just so you know what to expect).  When I entered, I was immediately and enthusiastically greeted by the staff, even though the restaurant was extremely packed. They sat us down quickly and took our order promptly.  I was starving, so I ordered two pounds of the Shrimp on the Hot n Juicy sauce. I got it spicy, but for those of you who cannot handle spice well, I suggest getting a medium or lower.   The food was absolutely fantastic. the shrimp were all perfectly cooked and coated with the delicious sauce. BE WARNED: this is extremely messy. They give you gloves and a bib and I highly suggest you take it. Don't come wearing anything too fancy because I guarantee the sauce will get somewhere.   Overall, I would highly recommend anyone wants some delicious seafood at a reasonable price to come to this location and enjoy the hell out of yourself. It's fun, it's delicious, and it's an experience. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"The worst crawfish restaurant and the worst service forever.  Im so upset ab the food over here. I should have gone to Boiling Crap instead of here."}
{"text":"I'm from New Orleans and I've been to my fair share of crawfish boils but I have never tasted anything like this! My lips are still a little tingly as I write this and that isn't a bad thing.  I had crawfish and shrimp. The shrimp were huge! I got them both \"hot and juicy\" style and medium heat. I ordered Hot but the server was like \"are you sure? You've never been here before.\" On her recommendation I got the Medium and I am glad I did. I probably could have handled the hot but I wouldn't have enjoyed it. If it wouldn't have been totally inappropriate I would have slurped the juice off the table!  My hubs got the fried shrimp, also HUGE and battered in fish fry which was nice. He isn't much of a seafood eater but he even said he would like to go back. The beer selection isn't bad and the service was overly attentive if anything. Definitely quality. If you are delicate and don't want to get your hands dirty this isn't the place (they give you gloves but don't be that guy/girl) but I do recommend the bib."}
{"text":"Got here right at 11. There was a new girl training, Mary, and we could not even tell she was very helpful as well as the whole staff actually.  Best thing on the menu is the blue crabs. So sweet and fresh. If you can't pick what to try try those! It is a lot of work but so worth it! Definitely try the hot n juicy flavor. Spicy is good too!! Dungeness is OK  Can't wait to be back!!!"}
{"text":"The service was awesome!!! Audrey is first class all the way. From the time we walked in we were treated like we owned the place mad the food was delicious! If you are in Henderson and you want great crab and or crawfish you gotta come here."}
{"text":"After living in the Las Vegas valley for several years and have never gone to Hot and Juicy Crawfish. Now I can say that I went. But I won't be back. The food was good  the atmosphere great, the service is what is lacking. We were seated and then asked if we wanted anything to drink, I said no because I would like to see the menu. Well no one came .  We waited and waited.  I said we would wait 2 more mintues and then we would leave.  Finally were served.  Food took forever even though tables that were seated after us received their dinner before us. I never knew who my server was. They all asked or stopped by the table. But never when I needed them. It's too bad."}
{"text":"Fabulous meal!  The food was delicious and the experience better. Left the strip behind us and experienced the common Las Vegas !  Take the time to explore the real Las Vegas"}
{"text":"This place is better than the other location off the same street. It's a bit bigger and seems to have faster service. The pound of shrimp with corn, potatoes and sausages is what we usually order. The hot and juicy sauce is awesome!be aware that even the mild has a good amount of spicy! Fun place to get your hands dirty and have some good, fresh seafood"}
{"text":"Worse experience. Having to wait 45 min for you food to come. If you know an item is a hot seller you should plan for it, especially on a weekend"}
{"text":"It's taken me a bit of time to update this review but here it is. The management of this establishment immediately apologized for the poor service I received and assured me that the waitress I had commented about was no longer employed there (because of other complications as well, thank goodness because I thought I was going to have a bad karma chip follow me). I'm impressed by the management for the quick reply, however I will only allot one additional star to the  review. The food once again was decent, hopefully the service is up to par now."}
{"text":"My favorite place for as the name states.... hot n juicy... but not crawfish, mainly shrimp ! XD Even having other places open with similar type and style, i still eventually come back to be completely satisfied.   I remember going to the original location, up the street, closer to Decatur a few times before this location opened. Due to the years that one's been running, and the small \"enclosed\" location, i was happy when this one opened. I believe it was called a different name before this one opened but it was similar in style. After that one closed, Hot n Juicy took over !  My best friend and I were happy. More open location. Brighter. Newer ! ! AND LESS SMELLY !   Parking can be a pain sometimes due to it being in a plaza with other popular restaurants like DJK and Pho Kim Long but still worth it. AND its still technically down the street from my house xD just a little farther down spring mountain than the original location....   Most TVs are easily viewable from almost any seat in the restaurant for those who love to watch sports or just to watch something while eating.   Prices for shrimp and crawfish is at $11.99/lb (As of 01/31/16).   My usual is Hot n Juicy Special (medium or spicy or maybe extra spicy - depending on the day) + a corn (MMMM SOAKS UP ALL THAT FLAVOR) and shared cajun fries (ketchup does cut the spice sometimes XD)  TIP: If you are like me and my friends, who refuse to use those oversized gloves... clean your hands BEFORE going to the restroom with some wedges of lemon. Lemon juice cuts smell and cleans well before you go to scrub up some more and finish off in the restroom :)"}
{"text":"Food was delicious!  We had the shrimp with corn and potatoes.  Was served fast and the service was great!"}
{"text":"What's not to love about this place? They have seafood, you wear a bib, and are expected to eat with your hands (gloves provided). The customer service was great (Rachael and Lemonade). It was our first time ever eating at Hot N Juicy Crawfish and our server (Rachael) provided samples and recommendations. She's was very pleasant. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This will definitely be my go-to alternative for Cajun seafood until time permits me to make a trip out to Cali for Boiling Crab. There IS a distinct difference between BC's and HJ's sauce - BC's is more buttery and garlicky which I like (but I just love butter and garlic in general).  HJ is definitely less greasy and I can tell there are some big differences in the spice/seasonings they use.    The overall flavor was pretty good, as I killed a whole lb of shrimp in the 'Hot N Juicy' Medium sauce by myself and wanted more, still. The shrimp were big and succulent.  The clams were not so hot... I felt like we paid for all shell and no meat, and what meat there was at the bottom of the bag were very small and unappetizing.  Of the two lbs of clams I ordered, the second which was supposed to be a garlic butter seasoning finally came out after 3 different servers asked if I had gotten my order yet and if it's correct. And when it finally came, it looked and tasted exactly the same as the traditional 'Hot n Juicy' seasoning, not garlic-butter.  The service was not so hot either, but I understand they are still going through their soft opening and their servers probably didn't expect all of Arizona's Asian population to show up at the door, and some.  With that being said, I was pretty annoyed at the 9 different servers we had.  Though most were nice and polite, we only really needed 1 server.  They should work on re-organizing table assignments.....  Overall, I would definitely come back, in hopes that they are better organized and that they have non-anorexic clams."}
{"text":"I am always craving this spot. I always leave full and happy! The crawfish, shrimp, and clams are my favorites. I mostly order the hot n juicy special extra spicy. Lemon pepper and garlic butter is also yum. Always with a bowl of rice or two. Fried stuff is great too as well as the sausages. I've tried the crab and it's real good but too much work for tiny pieces so I usually pass on that. Totally recommend this spot. I came to this place when it first opened and it's crazy to see how it's grown into expanding to so many locations. A must stop! Yum!"}
{"text":"After seeing this on Man Vs. Food, I knew I had to try this place during my recent visit to Las Vegas.  Located not far from the strip, in China town area, this place serves great crawfish spiced to your preference (i.e. w/ corn, sausages, extra spicy, etc.)! A well shelf'd bar fits well given the amount of crawfish that was devoured!  Service was great/friendly, but beware, this joint can get packed during dinner. We got lucky and stopped by during lunch time (twice) during our stay."}
{"text":"Well, this weekend we went to Hot N Juicy. The wait was about 25 min. on a Saturday, not bad for Vegas I guess. The staff was great. They explained everything well and were very helpful. The food was fantastic. We tried the shrimp and crawfish in HNJ and garlic butter, both were great! The different sauces had good flavor, but beware of how spicy they can be. I love hot food, but the mild was too hot for me, I was sweating and nose dripping from the heat. I would suggest moving one hot level down to be safe. Be prepared to use your hands to eat or plastic gloves over your hands to eat. There are no plates or silverware. Most of the food comes in plastic bags and you eat on top of a clean plastic covered table. The only negative was the parking situation. The lot in front of the business is very small. We initially parked down the street but during the wait for a table a spot opened up so we moved. All the adjacent business parking have signs saying they will tow if you are not a customer of their business."}
{"text":"To be honest with you this place is 5 stars for a lot of people.  The hot n juicy sauce over crawfish seemed to have everyone at the table addicted.  I did really like the clams with hot n juicy sauce.  I can see why everyone LOVES this place.  The prices are also pretty great.  The food however was a little too heavy for me.  I was looking for something more on the lighter side.  That being said, this off strip place, is really popular, and I'm sure you'd like it."}
{"text":"I really have no business being in places like these since I don't eat anything from the sea or any body of water (except tuna & tilapia) but my family really loves the stuff.   We showed up at their other location and the wait was too long for us (30min) because we had grumpy toddlers. We called this location and as luck would have it all we had to do was show up in the next 15min and we could be seated right away.   I've never been to this one, but I like the ambiance a lot more in here than the other one...so much brighter. Honestly I can't be a reliable opinion on the crawfish or shrimp because I've never once tried even a lick. BUT I can tell ya what I thought about their chicken...?...if you're even interested to hear it haha...it's not at all the reason for people to visit here. The wings were good I guess, nothing special, no fancy sauces or spices. The fries mediocre. And the chicken nuggets...I'm almost 100% sure they were the ones you get in the freezer section at the grocery store, Tyson's. Also...I'm a ketchup snob, it is my own preference that the ketchup be Heinz and their's was definitely something generic. Everyone at the table who ate the crawfish and shrimp really enjoyed it, and their Cajun fries...I know that much.   It was pretty loud in there, and the other location is the same way. I really don't like having to yell my order at the server but it is what it is. My daughter didn't appreciate the noise level, so we ate quickly and I took her outside where we played while our family finished. But otherwise, very high energy...it's a fun place to go with a really great group of people."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best seafood place I've beenin Vegas. I am from California and we have almost similar seafood restaurant here. I give it a 4 stars because after eating the shrimp my stomach and all of my friends who ate the shrimp started to have stomach problems throughout the night. But other than that, food was not over cooked which I hate because if you over cook shrimp their skin tends to stick onto the meat so it's frustrating to peel. I would go here again but probably order something else other than shrimp. Would love to try the other seafood. Hoping my stomach would be okay."}
{"text":"Don't be alarmed when you drive up, it might not look like much from the outside (or the inside to be honest) but GO IN!  It was awesome. Better etouffe than we had in MS. The crawfish were delicious and the beer was cold and cheap. If you don't like heat, go somewhere else, the mild is hot and the spicy is outrageous.  We had 1 pound of crawfish, oysters, etouffe (x2), cajun fries, and rolls (save the $1.50 and skip these) and we were so full we took some etouffe to go.   If you are visiting Vegas, it is so worth the trip off the strip, by far our favorite meal in Vegas so far."}
{"text":"Number one go to crawfish boil outside of Louisiana. Would have to say that their food is above standard and the service is great! This place has great prices!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing but our waiter was a jerk. He rolled his eyes at us, got annoyed, threw our check down and avoided our table. So not impressed with customer service"}
{"text":"Always a great place to chow down. King crab legs, shrimp, hot n juicy medium. Might have to try the spicy next time. Mah lips are burning but SO good!"}
{"text":"saw this place on food network man vs foods, so my friends and i went and eat there...when we got there the place is pack but we got seated pretty quick....we order some crawfish and shrimp, both of the favor was great!!!!"}
{"text":"The food is ok, the items are served by the pound. It killed me that the restrooms were dirty- especially in a place where everything is being touched by hands. The little corn appetizers were good. Our waitress was bogged down by a huge party- which is fine- but we had 4 different people bringing us doubles of drinks but our order took forever because it hadn't made it's way into the kitchen."}
{"text":"I am incredibly glad that we came here during my first trip to Vegas and didn't even have to wait.  It is a very busy place and we had at least two people serving us.  My sister and I shared 4 lbs of the Hot N Juicy flavour medium, as well as a bowl of white rice.    Amazing.  Seriously.  The crawfish were fresh and delicious.  The sauce was addictive and I poured some on the rice.  We could have gone hotter and probably will next time.  And $3 beers?  Yay!  I tried a shrimp, which was cooked perfectly.  The Cajun fries unfortunately was lost on me since my mouth was so full of the crawfish seasoning.  Everything was pronounced very tasty and it was fun getting dirty.  The price was reasonable and we made plans to come back for lunch in two days.  Unfortunately, we didn't make it and I will just have to drive down to DC instead.    Go here and you will not be disappointed.  Definitely worth the trip off the strip."}
{"text":"Food is always amazing, we at least come by twice a month. Jared always takes care of us and gives great customer service."}
{"text":"Visited this location earlier tonight with a group of friends and was not impressed at all by the \"by the book\" staff.  As part of our order, we ordered a dozen oysters.  The waiter came and said, \"we only have 4 left for the night.\"  We said, \"ok no problem, bring the four.\"  The waiter said, \"Let me check with the manager and see if I can sell them to you.\"  We said, \"ok\".  Mean while we were talking amoungest our selfs discussing how weird it was that he wouldn't just have offered us the oysters for free beings they only had four left.  He came back said stated he could not sell us the oysters as it would screw up there inventory.  WTF????  Are they planing on saving them till they get their next shipment to be able to complete a order of 6 or 12?  It's situations like this where customer service is completely ignored because someone be it the waiter or manager didn't have the balls to make a judgment desicion.  I only give this place two stars because the craw daddy's we did order were very good."}
{"text":"The food is phenomenal and the flavor is beyond excellent.. Hot n juicy all the way bay bay"}
{"text":"I like that they offer gloves. The shrimp was fresh but small. There seasoning was on point. Their mussels were great too."}
{"text":"When our friend posted a pic on instagram, we thought he was in Vegas.  Read the comments and was excited to see that the location was in Phoenix!  After reading that, my wife and I looked at each other and said \"LET'S GO!!\"  We went a couple of days after they did their soft opening.  It was nice to see that there was no lines to wait in since we know it won't be like that for long.  The staff had high energy and very welcoming.  The service was on point with regular check ups and water refills.   The food was delicious like always.  We (party of 3) ordered  2 lbs of shrimp, garlic butter, mild (spicier that usual) with bowls of rice.  My wife and I usually share 1 lbs of shrimp and we leave full.  I'm looking forward to trying new item on the menu now that we have a location here."}
{"text":"Alexis was our server, and she was both attentive and friendly. The food was just alright. The seasoning was good, and the chicken nugget meals that our kids had were good. The crab legs were where it went wrong. We had 2lbs of snow crab legs, but when we cracked the first few open there was so little meat that we didn't actually have anything to remove from the shell.  I actually took photos of the lack of crab meat in the crab legs because I have never seen anything like it. Alexis made the experience better by being great, we just wish the food had been on point. We will stick with The Angry Crab from now on."}
{"text":"I've gone here every New Year's Day in the last four years. But this time, there no longer serving fresh crawfish.  Frozen only. Not cool."}
{"text":"What else can I say but mmmmmmmm. We had the address on the GPS but just happened to see this one before we reached our destination. Come to find out, there's two locations super close to each other. We went straight for the seafood. We got a pound of crawfish in garlic butter, mild and a pound of snow crab legs, in garlic butter mild. Everything was awesome! I would have liked it more spicy, but wifey couldn't have handled it. next time we'll prob both get our own stuff. The seafood was super fresh and cooked to perfection. Messy, but super worth it. Def go if you want a cool no frills seafood experience. and make it spicy!!!"}
{"text":"Overpriced not great Seafood one time experience. One of those places that you go to for the first time and experience and accept it for what it is . I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I really like this place but lately it hasn't been as good as before. We went to dinner last night and the food was over cooked. The shrimp were tough and the rice was soggy. Sadly I might be looking for a new joint."}
{"text":"Been here before about a year ago. While on a weekend vaca stop by twice. We ordered the same thing. 2lbs Alaskan King Crab with Hot n Juicy Mild. Both times the sauces came out really salty. I recommended this place to family and Friends in the past but after the experience we had I would not recommend anymore. Dissapointed that it doesn't taste the same as before."}
{"text":"A little better than Boiling Crab in SoCal. I had the Hot N Juicy special Crawfish, medium heat. I pretty much inhaled it. The sweet potato fries were made perfect. I cant wait to come back for more!"}
{"text":"Our server Max did a great job and accommodated for all our needs. He answered all our questions and we felt very welcomed. The food was perfect and exactly how we wanted it. Great experience and very happy with our dinner. Definitely going back soon."}
{"text":"So this was my first time eating here and the food was amazing, our server Loren did a great job of showing me how to order the shrimp with the different spice levels, flavors, and amounts being served. She was very helpful and made the entire experience great. I ordered the hot and juicy baby spice thanks to her recommendation and I was very satisfied. Thank you again!"}
{"text":"Love how much flavours are packed in those bags!  I held off trying hot n juicy for the longest, mostly because of the location but after hearing how good it is from friends and family, I had to try this place out for myself. And boy, it did not disappoint!   Went with a group of 6 friends so we decided to order a bunch of seafood to share. We went with 3 orders of the get your feet wet combo and a few extra pounds of shrimps. I can not get over how much flavour its packed with. I usually don't order rice with this kind of food but since the Hot n Juicy sauce was so good, I did actually get an order of rice. My only complaint is their cajun fries were way too spicy.   I like to think I can eat pretty spicy and mild hot n juicy was good enough for me. It gives a little kick without being too spicy for you to enjoy your food. I tried the baby spice too and it was not enough kick for me.   I would definitely go here more if they would open up another location."}
{"text":"One of my absolute favorite spots in LV. The sauce is so much better than their competitors and they are always consistent. I crave hot and juicy snow crab legs with corn at least once a month. It's life changing!!! Great service too!"}
{"text":"This is the best seafood place in Vegas.  Period.  End of discussion.  End of review."}
{"text":"We came in for the weekend and stayed at the Rio which a 5 minute cab ride and all I can say is wow...this place is really great. Anyone that eats at a buffet in on the casinos instead if getting out and trying a great local place like this is crazy. We tried just about everything they had but favorite was the head on shrimp and the mussels. The crawfish were kind of undersized so I will stay away from that next time. We had the extra hot and it was perfect--not unbearably hot but it had a great flavor. The only warning I have about this place is that someone doesn't like seafood or the smell of seafood don't bring them with you. This is a must try place in Vegas at a very reasonable price. Oh and the wait staff was very helpful for us first timers"}
{"text":"If I could give them no stars I would give them negative stars. Literally the worst service i have ever received or should I say no service. Apparently our waitress was the manager which makes things worse. Danielle did not check on us once. We had to flag down waitresses to order more food, had to remind them about refills, and when she same came with the coke glass she said oh you have sprite and never returned. Had to ask for the check. Had to ask for someone to take the check. He even held the check in the air! Lol We asked who our server was and we were stuck between two tables who were getting serviced lol good food for what? Never returning 100$ for nothing. Every other server was so happy to help other people but not us!!! It's sucks they don't have a complaint line because we just wasted our money.     Steer clear boiling crab is just around the corner!  with real service real tables real managers."}
{"text":"The food here was great, our server niki was even better! Def stop here and I recommend bringing some gloves so your hands don't stink!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. All the locations of hot N Juicy are great but this one is bigger and less bust than the ones on spring mountain road. I reccomend the hot n juicy sauce on everything. When they ask you whate spice level you want you probably dont want to go above a medium. I love my food spicy but i sometimes regret going past medium at hot n juicy."}
{"text":"What a perfect name for this place. Hot N Juicy, exactly how everything is. We got the crawfish, whole shrimp and sausage all in the HNJ Special (combination of all the different flavor) seasoning, Fired Catfish basket and Etoufee. All were seasoned and cooked perfectly. There was nothing left when we were done. Great wait staff, they explained the menu well learning we were first time customer. Oh yeah, don't forget to put on your bibs."}
{"text":"I haven't tried any of the crawfish places around here because I was born & raised in Louisiana & didn't think anyone could do crawfish like we do. I can say that I'm really glad that we gave it a shot because HOLY MOLY that was some good crawfish. My girlfriend said her shrimp po'boy was good, too. Can't wait to see what it's like right in the middle of crawfish season!"}
{"text":"I would give this restaurant a three stars. Don't take me wrong I like Hot N' juicy Crawfish.However,if compare it with The Boiling Crab I prefer the boiling crab to the hot n' juicy crawfish.Why? It is because the boiling crab sauce is a bit more delicious and suit my taste better than the hot n' juicy crawfish.A bowl of rice here served in a small bowl so if you are a big eater it won't be enough. The hot n' juicy and the boiling crab has a similar menu except the boiling crab have gumbo and the hot n' juicy doesn't.   However,if you are an alcohol drinker Hot N' Juicy Crawfish has an alcohol license while The Boiling Crab doesn't serve alcohol.   I would give this restaurant 3 or 3 1/2 stars."}
{"text":"If you love seafood, you definitely need to come here. Fairly messy so prolly no first dates =p. It is kind of spicy even with the garlic and butter mild. I don't usually like anything spicy, but thus was definitely worth burning my mouth"}
{"text":"One word! MESSY!!!!! Seemed expensive to me but my wife and our friends we went with loved it.  Had to wait about 20 to 30 mins which for me is a huge stretch.....I get less than excited to wait long to eat, but its quite an experience.  Food was pretty good though I must say.  Next time I'm gonna bring my own gloves, lol!!"}
{"text":"Still hands down one of the best seafood places in town. It's a small place, but has big taste. I try to go here every couple of months. Oh yes!!!!!! I will return"}
{"text":"Finally HnJ in AZ, the food was good like always, the shrimp is bigger as well as the crawfish! But what really sets this place apart from the rest is the SAUCE (hot n juicy special); its really good.  The place is cozy and clean...forget about the horrible parking (you'll need to walk a lil bit after dining here anyway  )"}
{"text":"I've had this place bookmarked forever and I finally got to go.  I don't regret it.  I've found a yummy crawfish place in Vegas.  I ordered a pound of the crawfish, with the Hot N Juicy special sauce, mild.  Threw in a potato and some corn on the cob.  Even the mild had a good kick to it.  My lips tingled for an hour after I was done eating.  Sweet potato fries were good too.  Their crawfish were humungous when I was there.  About 3 inches in length, compared to the 1.5 inch ones I get at the Boiling Crab in So Cal.  The only thing I wish is that the sauce had chunks of garlic in it.  That's what I love.  On a bad note, my husband said their wings totally sucked.  I didn't try them but they did look really small.  HNJ is a couple bucks more expensive than Boiling Crab in Ca.  Parking sucks.  There was a 20 minute wait for four people on a Monday night.  Service was friendly and attentive.  Restaurant is clean and comfortable.  Overall, I'm a fan and would go back."}
{"text":"This will be my first stop for my seafood fix when I return to Vegas. Good flavor, great music and friendly staff.  There are limited parking and can get busy so be sure to come right when they open. The fresh raw oysters was the best I've had.  I ordered \"get your feet wet.\"  The shrimps were huge and it was extremely spicy, but that is within my taste buds. Our waiter Mason was very professional and attentive. Definitely would recommend this place to all the seafood lovers!"}
{"text":"Love this place! No plates, not utensils, no problem....use your hands - just don't touch your eyes while eating the spicy seafood!   Known for it's crawfish, I more enjoyed the spicy crab legs & shrimp. Order by the weight of the food in a plastic bag & use your hands to eat. They give you a plastic bib and rolls upon rolls of paper towels on your table. It's really messy (NOT DIRTY, there is a difference) but my opinion quite worth it. I was full when I arrived here with friends and I still ended up being the last one to finish eating.   Would definitely go here again when I visit Las Vegas. This is the newer location, only slightly closer to the strip. I have not been to the older location, but probably will visit it when I'm there next. Highly recommend if you don't mind using your hands to eat.   The only bad thing I can think of is my hands smelled like garlic for a week.....but is that really a bad thing? Keeps the vampires away. :D  My rating 1-10 (10 being the best) Atmosphere: 9+ Food: 9+ Cleanliness: 7 Noise: 7 Service: 7 Overall: 9"}
{"text":"Sooo fucking good but I always have the worst gas afterwards.. zoo now i just get the non butter and garlic seasonings... still good tho.. but yeah.. no gas for my ass. peace ho!"}
{"text":"On par with boiling crab but has its own unique flavor. This was the first place I had boiled seafood outside New Orleans. It is great and delicious. If you prefer crawfish, call ahead to make sure it is fresh not frozen that day. They will gladly tell you. When it is fresh get there early before they sell out!"}
{"text":"The original and the best seafood in Vegas. Bring gloves, because you're going to get sauce on your hands and all over the place."}
{"text":"Just as good as the original, but larger.  No two-hour wait this time.  Best seafood in Vegas."}
{"text":"Hot n juicy is 100% hot n juicy ! freshest fish in Las Vegas, crawfish are moist with tons of flavor, the shrimp are delicious! the have many sauces from mild to super hot, take your pick , this is a great restaurant to go with a group of friends like i did New Years Day, we had so much fun and it is fun to share all the shrimp and crawfish... and they do have chicken dishes for those who dont like fish,,, but if you dont like fish you have to try theirs and i am sure you will LOVE HOT N JUICY as much as I do and my friends... pour the sauce in the rice ...............Mmmmmmmmm.... Mmmmm.. good !"}
{"text":"This place is lit, the shrimp is BOMB, customer service BOMB, everything about this place is firrreeee. Shout out to Aimee & Marina for being the best! Love love love Hot N' Juicy."}
{"text":"Maybe we went on an off day or maybe we have been spoiled by The Boil in NYC but this place did not meet our expectations.   The service was lacking. We had to ask for utensils for our crab legs, gloves and for the bucket to put our shells in.   Additionally, we ordered one pound of crab legs each and received what appeared to be less than one pound based on our previous experiences at other establishments. When we inquired about this, we were informed that they don't actually measure the crab legs by the pound but they count the number of crab legs per order. This can be a bit misleading.   Despite its shortcomings, it is a cute restaurant. If I wasn't so spoiled by The Boil, I might have enjoyed my meal here today."}
{"text":"Ate here for the second time . Our server was very nice and prompt and always checked up on us . The place was starting to get busy and we ordered beers and the fried shrimp basket to start .   I had the Étouffée and Blue Crab !! étouffée was incredible .... Highly recommend and you won't be disappointed! Right amount of heat and consistency!! Blue crabs were a bad choice on my part probably cause it was to much work and very messy !!  My wife had the King Crab legs ! They were very good and she shared !! Next time I will have the King Crab legs and étouffée !!   The corn and sausage with potatoes were very yummy but feel they should throw that in with the pound you order !! Only reason for the four stars is they forgot my corn , sausage and potatoes till the very end !!"}
{"text":"Delicious!!! I was skeptical about trying it because I've been so spoiled in California with all of our options with crawfish restaurants but I'm glad I decided to try it out! We had the sweet potato fries for the appetizer and it was good. We ordered the crawfish but they were out of the red (wasn't too fond of the crawfish they substituted it with) don't order it if they're out of red crawfish. The sauce was good but it could save the taste of the crawfish. We also had the shrimp in the house spice I believe. I loved it! The shrimp was huge, not soggy and flavorful! The lobster was great also! Huge lobster and a lot of sauce! The service was okay, but the food made up for everything!"}
{"text":"Food is good infused with Asian flavors sells sea food by the pound. Taste is spicy and buttery it is what we call a heart attack on a plate. :)"}
{"text":"Just ate there today and I think their sausage gave me some food borne illness.  I say this because the group we ate with didn't seem to be affected except those who ate more of the sausages.  Usually me and my fiance have iron stomaches, but this is not the case.  It's ruining my Vegas trip.  Me angry.  So is my stomach.  Never visiting any of their establishments again."}
{"text":"Imagine Burger King running out of burgers. That's what happened when we went to this highly touted but somewhat hole-in-the-wall joint just outside of the Vegas strip. They didn't have any crawfish, which is what we came for (apparently due to seasonal unavailability...I jokingly told them to rename their restaurant).   We didn't travel all this way to leave, so we ordered a pound of shrimp, cajun fries, corn fries, and fried calamari. Don't be surprised if the food is no-frills. Cajun fries were regular fries sprinkled with \"cajun\" spices. Umm, ok. Nothing to brag about, really. Decently priced, and portions were better than average. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here again, and neither should you."}
{"text":"I'm surprised with all the negative reviews. I've always had good experiences here. Or maybe I've been lucky and got the good servers. Only complaint is the occasional long wait to be seated...but then again they are busy so that's not really their fault.  Good food, worth the wait."}
{"text":"I was so excited when I heard they were opening a Phoenix location. I absolutely love crawfish & would intentionally make a trip just to visit boiling crab. Hated the long trip there but food made up for it lol then I tried Angry crab shack in Mesa thinking it would be a replacement for BC but was utterly disappointed. Then came this place :)  First off, the crawfish at Hot & Juicy was delicious! Very comparable to BC, maybe even better. I had 2lbs of crawfish (hot& juicy flavor, spicy hot level), it was perfect. The menu is very easy to read. It pretty much comes in steps where you picked your seafood, pick which flavor, and how hot you want it. Couldn't have been easier right? Two thumbs up for food!   Service.....was FABULOUS. We had Jasmine, who was very friendly, attentive, and there soon as something was needed. All the staff regularly dropped by to ask if we were ok or needed anything. Service was wonderful.   The place itself is spacious so there's plenty of room. Atmosphere was relaxing. Overall, I loved the food & service. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"I love hot and juicy, but this location gets a 1 star because one day i went and it was  right when they had opened. The waiter took us to our table it was 6 of us. And i asked the waiter if she could move us to another table because becuase the sunlight was hitting our table. She said no. I let that slide. So the whole time she wouldn't check up on us. I never got the refills i asked for in 2 of our drinks. Our waiters name was Rizzan. I'm not going to this location again."}
{"text":"Great Cajun food in Las Vegas.  I had crawfish and shrimp, extra hot.  Very delicious.  The shrimp was better than the crawfish, but both were great.  The andouille sausage was mediocre at best and I wouldn't order it again.  The potatoes and corn were delicious, as well.  The food is served in bags in a wet sauce.  It's not the typical way I've had crawfish and shrimp.  It was different, but quite delicious.  I would definitely go back.  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"I almost threw up the minute I walked in this dive.  What a pit.  the smell of \"fish gone wrong\" was too overwhelming for me.  And the place was DIRTY.  Seafood and dirt DO NOT mix.  The service was awful if you are not Asia....seriously....all the Asian folks were taken care of immediately.  We ordered, then I made the mistake of going to the bathroom to wash my hands before I ate.  OMG.  I'm sure I picked up masses of germs just walking in that hole.  Food came, and I swear we didn't eat it.  The shrimp were so tough it was impossible to really eat.  The crawfish?  It's like someone said below...it was like fish bait!  SO dirty and what really pissed me off was that I asked for medium and instead got the spiciest hottest juice ever.  When I asked if it was correct, she just shrugged her shoulders.  Wow.  Disgusting, will never eat here again and will never suggest it to anyone who doesn't want to get sick."}
{"text":"I love eating here. One of my favorites and price is reasonable. Customer service is always great. Whenever I crave for shrimp and seafood, I just go here."}
{"text":"I know a lot of people love this place so i'm trying to review based on what i've heard from others.  As i'm not a huge crawfish/shrimp eater. So removing my bias towards the food, i think the place is great.  You wanna go here if you wanna get down and DIRTY with your crawdaddy's!  You order the suckers by the pound, cooked to perfection with your prefered flavor and spice, crackem open and suck their soul juicy flavored soul out.  If your a shellfish eater this place is a blast to be get grub on cause the tables are just lined with plastic and all you really do is just get your food slapped on your table, open your bag and dig right in baby.  Theres no holdin back.  You'll have a pile of ravaged food 30 mins later and everones gonna think your pregnant with a little food baby in it's 3rd trimester.  Waitiers were always super friendly and it's just a fun rowdy environment.   Parking kinda sucks goin into the place but hey, you cant winem all right?  I give 4/5 cause while teh food is good i'd like to see better seating.  I'm a tall guy so i'm kinda picky with where i sit and everytime i've come here i just feel crammed.  OH well i can get over it though.  as yelp says \"Yay! I'm a fan.\""}
{"text":"My husband and I have been Hot N Juicy Crawfish fans since moving to Las Vegas eight years ago. This new opening was a wonderful surprise! The food is amazing and the service is impeccable, as always. We ordered the Hot N Juicy (medium spicy) seasoned crawfish, which were small and frozen to start with, but had an amazing flavor and texture. The perfect crawfish season is Fat Tuesday (2014 = March 4) thru July 4th - so we are eating these delictable critters at an unseasonable time of year. BUT still quite yummy!  We love restaurants where all of the staff helps all of the patrons, and you don't have to wait for \"your server\" to be notified of your request. This is the perfect example of this customer service philosophy. Not only are you not waiting for anything, the entire staff stops by your table frequently to ask if you need anything. The assistant manager, Katie (totally adorable girl), even stopped by our table to make sure we had everything we needed - PERFECT!   This wonderful addition to the Hot N Juicy chain will not disappoint. If you love Cajun food, you must give your taste buds a treat, and check out this new addition to the Hot N Juicy chain, just south of the 215 on Eastern. Yummy!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! Prices are acceptable for seafood in Tempe. The hot & juicy sauce is fantastic and reminds me of Baton Rouge, LA!!"}
{"text":"Fresh fish at a decent price, very messy and alot of work but very good tasting."}
{"text":"I was contacted by management and my complaint was taking very serious. I appreciate the fact that they read and cared about my experience. I will give them another chance when I am in Vegas. As usual I will still be chowing down at the West Hollywood location. BOMB!!"}
{"text":"Adam Richman, I fucking owe you one.  While staying at the Palms, we realized how close we were to Chinatown (who freakin knew there was a Chinatown in Vegas??) and remembered that episode of Man VS Food. We always talked about wanting to try one of the places he went to. We were there...fuck it; why not?  Oh. My. Fucking. God.  Any restaurant that gives you a bib, has a garbage bag table cloth, and a huge roll of paper towels on the table ready for you definitely has a lot to live up to. We order 6 lbs of crawfish. Served literally hot and juicy looking in a bucket. You can see tons of garlic and sauces and even a potato and corn cob piece inside. We didn't even hesitate; we ripped opened the bags and started tearing some fucking heads off.   That was probably the most amazing thing I have ever tasted.   It was so flavorful and juicy and the spices kicked your ass a little, but you kept on eating anyway. Downing Sapporo's and water like there was no tomorrow. Not giving a flying fuck about heartburn or any other internal problems you'd potentially endure later.   It turned into one of our fondest Vegas memories.  That was 4 months ago and it's a FREQUENT topic amongst my friend and I to this day. We often turn to one another and say we'd give ANYTHING just to have that. We would drive that 11 hour drive all over again just to eat that. We didn't exaclty LOVE Vegas. At times, we absolutely hated it.  I hope I don't talk this up too much, but you must try it. You have to really dig in there and eat with your hands. Crawfish. Not shrimp or something you eat with a fork (although I bet it's delicious!). Pick that shit up with your hands and fucking enjoy going against any table manners your parents taught you.   Fuck you if you don't stop by before you leave Vegas."}
{"text":"If I lived in Vegas, I would probably hit this place weekly.  I had a pound of the spicy hot n juicy  and yeah it was hot and I couldn't get enough of it.  My wife had the medium hot n juicy and for her, it was just right, not hot enough for me though.  We also shared a pound of the lemon pepper shrimp and OMG it was amazing.    I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!  Keep up the good work YELPERS and keep up the great ratings."}
{"text":"This is one of the most fun dining experience I've every had! We arrived right before the place opened, and it was literally PACKED about 15 minutes after it opened for business.   The is the place where table manner and dress code is optional. By the time you are done, it will be messy with sauce all over your face your hand and piles of seafood on the table. So don't dress to impress, just bring something to cover yourself. :D Their ordering process is simple: Just order the choice of seafood, seasoning, level of spicy and add-ons. The Hot N Juicy special seasoning is absolutely fabulous. It's like a combination of  Cajun, black pepper and lots of garlic, so you got lots of flavor in one bag. The spice level is more like those you will find in a Thai restaurants, so when you pick spicy, it is really spicy. Make sure you order POTATOES as add-ons, it well pick up all the sauces and juices in the bag and you will be in potato heaven.  We ordered 2lbs crawfish, 0.5lbs shrimp, extra corn and potato in Hot N Juicy special seasoning and spicy. With two drinks it only cost us about 26 dollars. So it not only the best taste you will find in Vegas it will also be the best value in Vegas."}
{"text":"I've been searching for a good crawfish place for a year now. I'm from California and I absolutely LOVE the BOILING CRAB!!!! It's even difficult to find a place here in az as good as that one. Based on the reviews I saw I tried this place. It took forever for my grandmother fried catfish to get to the table about 20 mins after my crawfish did. The seasoning was watery( I like my seasoning thick) lol. It was ok. Idk if I'd recommend it for those who enjoy the boiling crab."}
{"text":"Been here twice. Both times they only had frozen crawfish. First time was on a busy holiday weekend which I could understand running out. The second time it was a Tuesday afternoon during crawfish season (today). Why can't you control your inventory and keep live crawfish during the season? If I wanted frozen crawfish I could literally go anywhere. I mean Crawfish is in your restaurants name right? Ridiculous."}
{"text":"I love hot n juicy. It beats boiling crab here in Vegas.  Would go 5 stars because I love it so much but there were a few bumps today with service and food  wait time Was a bit long today for food. My belly was rumbling watching food go out to guests that came in 20 minutes after us.   I'm not a fan of the system where one person takes your order, another runs the food and a random fills your drink. Our server never came back and I felt bad asking just anyone who passed for lemons and my bill. I'm assuming they split tips because it's the only reason I left one after being ditched by our server. They were all polite however.  Today we got   2lbs crawfish . Hot n juicy medium with a dozen sausages. I would say a 1/2 lb was just random claws with no body. Which is no good since they have no meat. I can't wait til spring when they get big! Otherwise they were fresh n tasty.  1 lb of shrimp hot n juicy spicy. Way too mushy. Yuck. This is a problem I have run into at the other location too on spring mtn. You can't even peel them, they just mush up. I actually found myself researching that texture, I thought over cooking makes shrimp tough, I would take hard over mushy any day. It's the reason I switched to crawfish, but when I bring new people shrimp is always a go to. Fix this please!   Plus a side of sauce for dipping... Yum  1 lb of snow crab hot n juicy spicy. Good enough. Fresh. But next time I will spring for the king crab  Chicken nugget plate for the kid. Cajun fries were too spicy for him though. Oops my bad.   Looking forward to bringing my sister in law in a few weeks."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today. We were the only people in the restaurant at first. We got the snow crab, potatoes and corn. Everything was amazing. There are a lot of places that are similar but the sauce here really is so much better than any of those places. Service was great, we were going through water pretty fast and she came by like every couple minutes thank goodness. We come here a lot and the food and service is always great. Would definetly recommend"}
{"text":"Loved this location much more room! Very nice staff and of course food is always amazing here when we visit from Hawaii!! Hot n juicy NEVER disappoints us ever! Every time we're in vegas we always stop here no matter what can't wait come back at the end of the year! Only down fall is the garlicky smell may stay on your fingers for a day or two but it's no big deal it's totally worth the garlicky smelly fingers hahahaha! I wanted to give thanks to our servers I forgot the names but you folks are amazing aloha!!!!:)"}
{"text":"Hot n juicy is just as good as boiling crab in San Jose, minus the 3+ hour wait, which is why it gets 5 stars. We had 1lb of crawfish (spicy) and shrimp (medium) 10.99 each. The hot n juicy special sauce is thick, garlicy & very flavorful. I looove spicy food, so if u can take spiciness go for the Spicy/ medium."}
{"text":"I love it, i love it, i love it.... did i mention i love it? So good. Spicey crawfish messy but so yummy. Service was nice and quick, so good surprised it was quiet inside. Next time in vegas i am here for more."}
{"text":"My husband and I had heard about this place from our friends and decided to check it out. We were a little put off by the lack of plates but what upset me most was that the shrimp was  mushy and hard to peel. We did NOT like the clams at all! Most of the shells all empty:( The good thing about this place is that the waiters are all great! Angela kept us laughing all night, and our drinks were never empty. We'd be willing to come back if they fix the clams."}
{"text":"Popular for the novelty of the concept and its feature on Man v Food, but the food just didn't grab me. The crawfish was tasty, but far too much work for the small amount of meat inside. The shrimp was heartier, but it didn't blow me away. The sauce and spice level were very good.  In hindsight, we spent more time making a mess and fighting with our food than we did actually eating or enjoying each other's company. It was fun once, but I won't be returning."}
{"text":"debating whether to do 3 or 4 stars. i decided 4 because i thought the food was great and even the crawfish was good (even though it was frozen--- and i never like frozen crawfish).   party of four people we shared a \"the drool\" meal (1/2lb snowcrab, 1lb shrimp, 1lb crawfish, 12 pcs sausage, 2 corn, 2 potatoes, and a cajun calamari), added 1lb king crab, 1lb shrimp, and cajun fries. also ordered 2 soft drinks. total was about $120 before tip.   sauce for everything was the one that combines all. its like the best way to go really!   only thing was our service was slow to check up on us and we had to keep asking for everything (refills, bibs, gloves, napkins, orders that havent arrived yet, basically every little thing). they were busy so i get it, but still kinda of annoying to have to keep asking for things.   located ln streetside of planet hollywood. so if your on the strip already, no need to drive to spring mountain one."}
{"text":"Oh em gee. I come here on average at least once a month. I wanna say it's their seasoning that gets me to come back everytime but I can't tell. When I went, crawfish was around $10 a pound and shrimp was a little less. I typically get shrimp because they have more meat and it is easier to get full. Crawfish meat is quite tiny once you peel the gigantic shell. If you buy 2lbs of crawfish, you automatically get a free corn and potato. Awesome!!! Get the hot n juicy special seasonsing which is basically a combination of all the other seasonings. I'm usually content with mild and medium spicyness level but my mother in law  get extra extra spicy and lemme tell ya... that kills you.   If you're lucky, you can catch them when they have etouffee (kind of like gumbo). Delish! Has pieces of crawfish, red bell pepper, celery.. etc. The flavor tastes similar to the hot n juicy special but I'm not sure.   Surprisingly, they have one of the bessstttt chicken wings anywhere. It comes out hot and fresh. The skin is super crispy and the inside is hot and juicy. Comes with ranch and ketchup and fries if you wish. A must have if you come!!!   Pros: CHICKEN WINGS & FRIES!!! Hot n Juicy Special seasoning  Cons: none really. Could be cheaper but business is business. =P"}
{"text":"MmMm! Hot and Juicy Crawfish is so delicious! Just recently I tried their lemon pepper seasoning for the crab, their garlic and butter for the shrimp and of course their Cajun seasoning for the crawfish and will do exactly that the next time! Everything had so much flavor, the corn on the cob and potatoes work perfectly and are great for soaking up all the juices!  Just be warned... You wont smell that great for awhile! We learned the first time and now take it to go :)"}
{"text":"This review is long overdue. Hot N Juicy is a staple among myself and my girlfriends! It is the ultimate, messy, satisfying meal.  We usually order:  -Crab legs (spicy medium) -Shrimp (spicy medium) -Add sausage and corn -Seasoned fries -Bud Light  I generally don't drink beer (the occasional Amstel Light when boating) but for whatever reason when eating at Hot N Juicy I just have to have a Bud Light to wash down all the flavorful, salty goodness.  Three tips:  1. YES wear the plastic gloves, if they don't give them to you, ask for them. Otherwise you will wreck your manicure with all the juice and sauce.  2. Bring a hair clip (if you have long hair)  3. Wear clothes that you don't mind absorbing garlic and HNJ sauce aromas. You will smell like a HNJ shellfish when you leave this restaurant.  Mmm just writing about this makes me crave HNJ now!"}
{"text":"Straight up seafood shack. I love seafood and I love spicy food and Hot n Juicy has both! And yes, you WILL get messy. Fair warning that if you don't like any of those things, this place is not for you and you can stop reading...  For those of you still with us, here's the word: Went in with family (3 kids plus grandma and me) on a Tuesday around 6, there were 4 or 5 other tables seated and the place isn't very big.   THE BAD (Why this is 4 stars instead of 5) Crawfish, unfortunately since it is the namesake, were disappointing. As noted by others, they border on microscopic and it was clear once I cracked the first one that they had NOT been purged prior to cooking. The \"butter\", which costs extra a la carte (50 cents a serving) is not real butter but some kind of almost butterish flavored oil, similar to what one might get on their popcorn at a movie theatre. Ick. Don't bother with it. Shrimp were slightly overcooked.  Now, on to THE GOOD - Everything else!!! We ordered all our seafood with the HnJ special seasoning, medium level which was perfect to add just enough heat but not overpower the crab and shrimp. Snow crab legs: big and meaty, far more so than what I have gotten at other places (Joe's Crab Shack for example), perfectly cooked and delivered piping hot! Oysters: I did not have the issues that other reviewers have. Ours were fresh, tasty, and BIG! Shrimp: again, big and tasty. Cocktail sauce: seems to be made with their special seasoning. It's unusual, but very good and has nice kick. Went well with both the oysters and shrimp. Calamari, Cajun fries, and andouille sausage were all excellent. THE SERVICE: Beyond a doubt, the best I've been taken care of, anywhere. Our server, Irene, was top notch. Checked on us continually, explained all the menu options with aplomb, brought everything we asked for quickly, drinks never empty. Couldn't ask for more. When I told her I wasn't happy with the crawfish, the manager, Heather, promptly addressed my concerns, apologized, removed them from our bill, and comped us a second basket of those oh so yummy fries.   Bottom line: a great place overall to get your seafood fix!! I get that service can get confused on Friday or Saturday night, but that's any casual restaurant during a rush. Lighten up Francis....."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. Receptionist in front was not affable and never smiled. Informed us it was a 25 minute wait but was more than an hour wait. No one came outside to check on us. Very disappointed indeed."}
{"text":"I checked out this place in April 2010 to see what the hype was about.  A group of my friends and I came to this place hungry because we saved our appetite for this spot.  I wasn't down for the hour wait that's why they get the minus star but I do not blame them because its such a popular place as it was showed on Man vs. Food.   As we were seated we ordered 1 pound shrimp, 1 pound snow crab and oysters.  It was definitely worth the wait!  You definitely get messy but of course they provide bibs and gloves for you.  If I was in the place again, I would come and eat here again with a group of friends.  Come prepared with the waiting period and a ready appetite! Worth the money and the trip! If you haven't tried it yet, your missing out!!"}
{"text":"Okay, first of the service was sloooow and it wasn't even busy. The two of the workers were standing up at the computer staring like they were trying to do a Chinese algebra equation. The One guy that was serving was helpful in handling our check and he wasn't even our server. Maybe our server just started our something.  The bonus about this joint vs any other crab/shrimp place is they have disposable gloves. They also have the little towlettes but never bring them to you until they bring your check. A little too late by then, just sayin'. They're sauces are nice though and their fritters are bomb ($5.95)"}
{"text":"Great management team! They actually listen to their customers and offer solutions and try to improve. My FAVORITE Cajun place ever, tbh I like them more than Boiling Crab in SoCal which is a big deal over there."}
{"text":"Came back last night with friends. The service has improved, servers were more attentive than the previous experience. I was recommended the clams with lemon pepper seasoning. It was really salty, I wouldn't try it again. Before that I had the Louisiana style and that sure tasted better. This time around, I gave the hot and juicy seasoning a try, and it was pretty good. I recommend everything in the hot and juicy seasoning bc it wasn't salty."}
{"text":"Okay, I can see why this place gets a bunch fo 4 stars.    This was my first time eating crawfish as was it for my wife.  So first off, we get there and the place is full, no waiting, just full of people enjoying their dinner.  We had stopped at another \"crawfish\" place nearby and there was litterally no one in the place.  That was the first clue that we didn't want to stay.  Then we did a quick Yelp and the average rating was 2.5 stars.  While Yelping the first restaurant we saw this place with an average of 4 stars.  Much better, so we headed on over.  Like I said, the first time we've had crawfish.   The first big plus, we were greeted and sat quickly.  The server asked if we had ever had crawfish before, and when we said \"no\", he brougt out two crawfish and showed us the process.  We ordered crawfish and crab legs.  Both were great, but beware, the \"mild\" sauce has quite a kick to it.  We also ordered calamari and sweet potato fries.  Everything was good.  Now, this is NOT A FIRST DATE PLACE.  But if you can find someone that will go here and  get dirty with you on the first date...marry them. :-)  Half of the fun is you eat your shell fish and just toss the shells on the table.  In fact, it's so messy, they give you a bib and plastic gloves(upon request).  This place is fun, good food, decent prices and just worth the visit if you haven't had crawfish before, or just want to eat some good ol' Southern crawfish, crab(blue, snow, dungenous) and catfish."}
{"text":"The food is great! But the reason i'm giving 2 stars is because of the customer service. Especially our server... She doesn't smile at all.... We just called her to request for water and she was frowning like we've been calling her 10 times.. Good customer service is very important in business to keep and increase number of your customer. So, If you don't make them feel welcome in your business. You'll definitely lose them. Not good in business... She's Terrible. This company must educate their staff about good customer service and how important it is."}
{"text":"Very clean place , great customer service .. Food is delicious one of my favs in Vegas"}
{"text":"Brought our parents here all craving some yummy crab and catfish. They delivered! We had 6 kiddos with us too. They placed us at a big table, explained the menu & gave us great service. Its not a fancy place, casual dining, and thats one of the things we enjoyed about it. Eating crab in this setting was perfect!   They also gave us a brief tutorial on how to eat crawfish (cool experiance for the kiddos too) and brought us samples of it for us all to try (kids included)  Food: Dungeness crab (served whole, which means legs and body) with the lemon pepper sauce. Was over a pound, so cost more but worth it because it tasted so good. The sauce was the  bomb! level of spice we ordered was called \"baby\" (lowest on the scale) It was just spicy enough for us weaklings. Snow crab (crab legs) were sweet and large. Our 9 year old ordered this with just butter sauce since she doesnt like hot spice. It was delicious just like that. There are 4 different sauces, one of which is all 4 mixed together. My mother in law ordered that with her crab and it was  pretty tasty.  kids got chicken baskets with fries, they were big so the little ones shared. And the father in law ordered basket of fried shrimp and fried catfish. He is a harsh critic, who loved the catfish! I didnt even have a chance to taste it! The only food we didnt like much was the corn fritters. too sweet and batter was not authentic.   Service: Great. All the waitresses there seemed on the ball and helped us out.    Pretty busy place, not impressive from the outside, but who cares? The crab is tasty and not too expensive. Its served in a bag with all the sauce, you wear a plastic bib, even plastic gloves if you want them. The only thing that would make me happier is good beer on tap. They only serve bottles. Give it a try. Its yummy!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time..crawfish charged by the pound and the crawfish missing heads. Smh!!"}
{"text":"I never thought I would say this, but I actually like Hot N' Juicy Crawfish a lot better than Boiling Crab. Don't get me wrong...I still really like Boiling Crab, but Hot N' Juicy was just excellent.   How could that possibly be you ask?   1) The equivalent to the \"Whole Sha-Bang\" was a lot less garlicky and overwhelming. I didn't leave the restaurant feeling like crap...and I wasn't still tasting the garlic the day after.   2) The food tasted a bit healthier (if that is even possible). Hot N' Juicy uses a little less butter, but it didn't seem to take away from the flavors - still leaving me craving for more.   3) The catfish was delicious. I haven't had the catfish at Boiling Crab so I can't really compare, but the catfish was perfectly juicy, crispy on the outside, and the tarter sauce was delicious.   4) There was a soup/stew-like dish (soup with Crawfish served with rice) was delicious. You can only eat so much shrimp and Crawfish, so this was a nice balance to the high-cholesterol meal.   5) The wait wasn't as bad. I came here with a friend and her family (party of 4) on a Saturday night and waited only about 20-25 minutes (the restaurant is off the strip).   6) You get a bit of a discount if you pay with cash (It's not like I can take advantage of this offer since I never have cash - but I thought I would throw that in there anyways).   Overall - great meal! I always love the ambiance!"}
{"text":"Oh ...I haven't written a review  on this place? Well, well, I love this place. I have been here twice and had a great time both times and cannot wait to come back.   I am gonna write the review for a little bit of both of my experience. My first time was fun and but the spice that we got was soooo spicy (mild hot n juicy) haha I know..we are babies. But for us, it was so spicy...I love the flavors tho and I kept eating anyways....  Second time around I went with my man...and man they took care of us. We just felt happy after we left since the servers were super nice and helpful. We asked them to change the channel to the football game and they were more than accommodating. We said it was Mando's first time and they definitely made an effort to make us feel well served. This time around for 2 people we ordered one pound of frozen crawfish $7.99 and one pound of shrimp $11.99 I think? We asked the server what flavor can we do since we don't want it to be super spicy even if it is mild...she suggested doing baby spice for whatever flavor we are getting and maybe the other pound more like a garlic butter baby spice...So we decided to get the crawfish baby spice hot n juicy and shrimp baby spice garlic butter and it was PERFECT!!!  We ordered rice for each and a drink for each...also added a potato and corn for each (extra $)  M doesn't like seafood that much and he definitely enjoyed himself and the flavors.   I cannot wait to come back!!! I'm craving it right now....that butter tho eeks.  P.S. It's better to eat with your bare hands...but be warned...wash your hands well or you will smell like garlic butter hot n juicy baby spice for a couple of days :)"}
{"text":"Bomb.com ! It was good and fresh. Awesome serves and good pricing. Order a level 9 spicy and it was great I should of gone for a 10. The best sauce to go with the Hot & spicy. Everything else is not all that."}
{"text":"I know everywhere busy on Sat but I got the worst service ever here! We got drink without a straw. They did not even bring us any gloves. After placing the food on the table, none of them came by and asked how we doing. We got the mild spicy garlic butter shrimp which was not too great either."}
{"text":"This place is off the hook! My other favorite seafood place to get some good cajun food!"}
{"text":"5 stars for the food for sure. I've tried their shrimp, lobster, calamari, and fried shrimp with fries. However, very pricy. I realize it's seafood, but still overpriced. That's my only complaint. Still, I will return. That's how much I like it!:)"}
{"text":"The experience of this place is a lot of fun! I wanted to find somewhere to spend a fun afternoon with my family for my dad's birthday. Well we found it! After reading some reviews about the place, I warned them all not to wear their fancy church clothes. And I'm glad I didn't let them because it is MESSY!   The food itself was ok. I read other reviews about too much salt, I have to disagree, not enough in my opinion. The food was a little bland and also kinda pricey for the amount of food you get. We were  all still hungry after almost spending over $200.  Another reason I knocked some stars off is because of the service. We didn't get just one waitress, we got 3 different ones. So we kept having to repeat ourselves. We clearly told them we were all gonna share everything, yet they forgot to bring everyone the utensils for the crab legs. Only half of us got them. There were 8 drinks, but we only got 6 straws, etc. it just wasn't good service. We still left a big tip because they did have to clean our mess afterwards."}
{"text":"Their food is finger licking good! Their shrimp is plump and juicy, the fries seasoning is to die for and their staff is friendly. The reason for 4 stars is that they tend to get super busy which means that you have to wait a long time for your food, especially their fries...but in the end it is worth it."}
{"text":"I am speechless.  My only regret is not meeting you a year ago.  Food and customer service is the best.  Shrimp,  crawfish,  crab, potatoes,  corn and calamari oh my !!!! Left my taste buds popping."}
{"text":"Just improve on beverage selection.  Great team and great food"}
{"text":"I came across the postings for Hot n Juicy crawfish and I just had to go try. Yummy! I had a pound of crawfish Hot n Juicy. It was very tasty and the price was very reasonable ($9.99 for a lb).  I only gave 4 stars since they didn't have gumbo and the service was pretty slow even though it was Sunday afternoon, and only 4 groups in the store."}
{"text":"Dropped in to the new shop... much more roomier than the original store. But the service was slow...more than 5 min after we were seated before someone came by with water and asked if we'd been helped. I used to be able to finish off a pound of shrimp before... not this time... my wife and I ordered 2 lbs, one garlic butter, and the other Hot N Juicy special mild. Between the two of us, we finished just a little over a pound. It's a little messy to eat, but yummy."}
{"text":"WOW! Seafood in a bag never tasted so good!!!   Although I have always thought that eating crawfish involves too much work for the amount of meat, you have to try all their variations on the menu - crab, shrimp, oysters, and of course crawfish.  You can try their different seasonings but their best by far is the \"hot n juicy\" special.   TIPS:  Wear the bib - You may look a bit funny but trust me, you don't want to spill hot n juicy goodness all over your shirt. Be prepared to smell - yes, hot n juicy goodness will follow you around for about a week, specially the smell of garlic in your hands.  :)"}
{"text":"Messy as hell but worth it.  Food comes out fast for a packed house full of people.  Mild spice is still spicy.  Friendly staff and food was outstanding."}
{"text":"My wife has always loved this place, and she loves the 1 pound of hot n juicy shrimp, but she was disappointed because the sauce was thinner and less flavorful.   I always get the calamari basket and it's always crispy and tasty, only this time the portion was tiny. (And it wasn't as crispy and it had very little flavor on top of that.) I asked about it and was told it's the same as always (it wasn't), but the guy was nice and gave me a discount. I didn't want a discount, I wanted the same portion size they used to serve. I like it with cocktail sauce and it used to be I used the whole cup of sauce and then some, but this time I barely used up half the cup. It seems to me the serving size now is appetizer sized whereas it was meal sized before, at the same price.   When I paid, this same guy asked how it was. I'm not going to say \"great\" just to say that. Now he became feisty, even though I wasn't being rude or obnoxious. He told me the servings are prepackaged and it's the same as always, and he didn't want to hear that it was smaller. \"I'm just telling you how it is,\" he said. \"So I'm lying?\" \"No, I'm just telling you how it is.\" Really, this is how to talk to a customer? You don't say \"I'm just telling you how it is.\" I might have given them a second chance down the road, but not now. I'm never going back. I've ordered the same thing probably the last eight times I've been there going back the last two years, and I know what the portion used to be and what it is now. I can't remember the last time I was this angry leaving a restaurant. There's something like three or more identical restaurants in the city, and this place has lowered their standards way too much to ever return."}
{"text":"I have a hard time leaving this review, but this was not the best experience.   Service was slower than slow.  The staff were super nice and friendly, but we waited a long time for everything...even drinks.  Placed our order for the drool sampler and 10 min later we were told they were out of crawfish.  How does a crawfish place run out of crawfish?  Ok, so we changed our order.  Once we got our food and started eating the server informed us that they now magically had crawfish.   Crawfish was the sole purpose of going to this restaurant so we asked for some.  We originally ordered the sampler, but because of the crawfish debacle our bill was now much larger than it would have been otherwise.   Overall the food was good, but the rest of the experience was not."}
{"text":"Great fast, friendly service, great seafood, fun environment enough said!"}
{"text":"It's been a long time that I used my hands to peel off the skin and eat seafood in a restaurant. And please don't use the gloves because you will waste the sauce on your fingers !!!!  Went there during lunch time and the restaurant was almost full. Luckily there's no wait throu !! Since this was the first time My bf and I went there; the server explained to us how to order and stuff like that.  We ordered 1lb of shrimp, 1lb of crawfish and a dungeness(forgot how to spell lol) crab. The two sauces that we ordered are garlic (medium) and hot n juicy special (medium). There are 4 kinds of spicy level from mild, medium, spicy and extra spicy. We had the medium and even my bf and I really like spicy food; medium is quite spicy. Would like to try \"spicy\" but never \"extra spicy\". People who can't eat spicy should just order mild.  We dunno if the seafood was fresh or frozen but it's ok since the sauce is REALLY GOOD !!!! Addicted to the Hot n Juicy special !!!! so good so good so good !!!!!  For people who never had crawfish before, crawfish is like a small version of the lobster and the meat is more soft than lobster. I think the meat is soft and good but i hate taking off the \"skin\".  My bf and I kinda regret ordering the \"dungeness\" crab because it was so expensive !!!! And we had a hard time eating the crab's meat and this crab costed us like $40 bucks !!!! We will not order this one next time; instead we will order more shrimp !!  heard that the corn and potatoes are good too!!! Will definitely come back!!  And for ladies please dun wear your fancy clothes or dress !!!"}
{"text":"Crawfish hot and juicy and spicy the best so much fun to eat and  sweet potato fries. I recommend wearing the gloves. Man versus food highly recommended love this place got to try it one in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"The crawfish was big and meat was great but I really think the sauce is way too salty. I ordered the hot and juicy flavor mild. Lots of sauce but it's so salty. Sauce at other places are definitely better. Prices here are a bit cheaper though. Wish they had bread instead of rolls. Rolls were way to soft and sweet. Corn was not good either, too mushy and not sweet."}
{"text":"Even though I was excited to try this place, I didn't have very high expectations and I'm happy to say that this place exceeded my expectations  This is located in Las Vegas' Chinatown.   The place was pretty crowded when we went. But I'm sure it's always like this. Our group ordered a spicy and medium spicy batch of crawfish, catfish, chicken wings. I'm sure there was more food, but I can't recall some of them.   Everything we had was delicious. They aren't lying about their spicy level! Even the medium spicy was very spicy. My bf had sweat dripping down his face. But everything had a good amount of spice and flavor. I will definately make a trip back here on my next Vegas vacation."}
{"text":"Wish I had read the review about avoiding \"small and soft crawfish\" before I went. Otherwise it was great. We had the crawfish, shrimp, oysters, corn and potatoes. Everything was great. The shrimp was the highlight. We had hot and juicy flavor with some mild and some medium. The medium was described as \"Tabasco\" level heat. The description was accurate. Some heat but not overpowering. Staff was helpful and knowledgeable. I will be back to try the crab."}
{"text":"It's pretty good. Ordered Étouffé and 1LB of Louisiana style spicy crawfish, the Étouffé was spicy but the crawfish wasn't but it was still good."}
{"text":"First we spent over a hour waiting which on a Friday is normal, we were seated and our server was Sisavanh who she walked by and said she be with us, 5, 10, 15 minutes pass nothing finally we grabbed another server Lexy who was amazing!!!!.  The food situation came out stanggard, while it tasted amazing we didn't get our dinner roles till about 30 minutes or longer in our service. We saw Sisavanh once to order sausages and 10 or so minutes after we ordered she came back to confirm the order. ..really?  All I can say is my experience at the Tempe location..Amaxing..Westgate not so.. but thank you Lexy for making our experience better..."}
{"text":"Super amazing Creole shellfish! We got the lobster, shrimp and King crab legs with corn on the cob and sausage. Bibs, tools and plastic bibs provided. Beer on tap. Creative cocktails. Po-boys.   4 of us ate and had beer/cocktails for under $200...and we ordered the high end items.   Service was incredible. Informative and educated about the food and drinks. Helped us tailor make our meal and create a fabulous experience. Will be back every time we are in Vegas!"}
{"text":"When crawfish is in season it is the best.  Otherwise, shrimp is awesome!! I also like to order the sausage and corn with it.. And I don't wanna forget about the yummy corn fritters!!!"}
{"text":"OK so I was REALLY REALLY looking forward to getting my Lousiana style crawfish / seafood. I've been missing my Boiling Crab in Cali. This was probably the closest I would get, since they don't have it in Chicago. I was a little disappointed by the crawfish, because the shell was super thick and hard, and there was just something a little different about the sauce. I still ate like a beast, don't get me wrong. I mean how can you not be a little messy when you eat with your hands and there's sauce everywhere...but I think I really would have enjoyed it a lot more if the crawfish was like what they give you at Boiling Crab. Maybe they're from a different region? It really makes a difference if their shells are so hard, makes it difficult to peel. And the taste of the crawfish meat was even different! Almost like it was a \"lower grade\" of seafood meat.  Anyway, we also ordered clams, crab legs, and shrimp. I really enjoyed the crab legs and clams, and the shrimp was pretty good too. We got fries to share, which was a welcomed distraction for our tongues after too much spicy/garlic-y goodness. I loved the corn on the cob, as usual."}
{"text":"Awful!!  We were so excited to try this place after it first opened.  I've traveled the entire Country, Canada, Mexico, and Spain.  I'm pretty easy since being a server in my younger day and I always tip.  We celebrated a surprise birthday party for a close friend (20 of us) land our experience was a total let down. Expensive, which we knew ahead of time - you can't get any seasoning for the chicken, not even a side of it.  Chicken is served as plain only. You can only have up to 3 checks no matter how big your party is and the service is poor..   I'd rate it a 0 if I could."}
{"text":"Food quality is there.. Service / waitresses could be a little bit more happier about their job.. The garlicky, buttery, Hot n Juicy smell in your breath and fingers need to go.."}
{"text":"Came in here with my rediculous family of around 20 people. We were loud and obnoxious but the staff was so proffesional and amazing! Our waiters were funny and went above and beyond to make sure we were happy.  The food was also just amazing. I am usually not a fan of crab but all the seasonings they had to choose from tasted delicious. Would definitely recommend the crab but I honestly loved everything I ate!  Pro tip: they give free samples crawfish and È what ever the soup was."}
{"text":"Inexperienced service, slow, unorganized. The food comes out in odd orders and it may be a spread of 45 minutes before all of your food gets to you. They always say they are working on getting parking compped for the garage but that has been the case ever since they've opened.  There's no team work in their service and our servers hardly ever comes around.   If you're like me and fell in love with this restaurant in Vegas, you'll be disappointed by your experience here in Tempe."}
{"text":"Game on! My lady is a NOLA native. While beautiful and refined she loves the dirty south. And loves crawfish. She turned me on to them and now I am addicted too. Everytime we went down to NOLA - 5 pounds. Every time the LSU alumni association would have a boil we were there. So I surprised her with a visit to HJCrawfish and it did not disappoint... Was it as good as NOLA? No f-in way. But really close and good enough.   The service IS stellar. They are all family. It's all their brother's business and they treat customers right. Right now they are getting crawfish from Texas and we think that may be why they aren't as good as they could be. Our hopes are then when they are back in season the crawfish will once again be coming in from Louisianna and they'll be even better.   Get the spicy - Good luck."}
{"text":"Theses people giving this place less than 4 stars are crazy! The hot n juicy sauce is amazing. !!!!! The biggest difference between hot n juicy and boiling crab is that boiling crab sauce is all grease and hot n juicy has very little grease but tons of flavor.  Service is always great too! I'm going there tomorrow! 2 pounds of shrimp please."}
{"text":"The best cajun seafood place here! I've been to couple other similar places in Vegas, but this place has the best hot&juicy sauce. Servers are very kind as well!"}
{"text":"Came in a few weeks ago during our weekly date night. Hot N Juicy is located in Glendale's \"premiere\" entertainment district, of which me and my friend Jack N like to refer to as restaurant cemetery. Since I live close by I continue to give these places a chance and more likely than not I'm leaving disappointed. Hot N Juicy was definitely the latter. Upon entering we waited, and waited, and waited to be seated. Mind you it was a Wednesday and the place was maybe 10% full or 90% empty, which ever way you wanna see it. We finally were seated and began small talk with our waitress. We made it clear we were new and have never been. Our server Maria, was friendly to start, made some suggestions and we ordered. My lady ordered some catfish, with a sprite, and me I went for the crawfish with corn and potatoes and a craft brew. Now I've never had crawfish before, but I like trying new things, and figured since it's the name of the restaurant it must be something they do really good. My lady's catfish came out pretty fast, before my brew actually. And was tasty. But they didn't bring the sauce she wanted and kept forgetting it everytime. Finally my bag was tossed on the table. I was baffled at how I would go in for the attack, since I had so bucket, utensils, or anything. I looked around and seen the few others in there eating crawfish with a bucket and some plastic type gloves. I asked and the waitress rolled her eyes like I was some sort of outcast. Finally this bucket came out and I started to go after them. This was all after my lady's plate has been sitting in front of her for about 20 mins. When I opened my bag in noticed the corn was missing. I asked and Maria said I'm she'll bring it out. Well, after 15 mins and two other broken promises my corn was never delivered. When I went to pay the manage Ilse Bernal asked if everything was ok, and I told her, it was ok besides the poor service and not bringing out stuff we ordered. The lady replies with a smart ass remark of, yeah well I'll take off 1$ for the corn. I know I sure as hell ain't gonna pay for something I never received. I also told her I was gonna write a review of how poor they are ran, and she replied with \"good luck with that\". Between that and the snarky remarked they made all night, I was waiting for Ashton Kutcher to come running out saying we were on the show Punked. It was the worst dining experience I've had in a long time. And the sad part is, they were damn near empty. I'd hate to see how this place is ran on a busy night. I wanted to like this place, I really did. It's close and I love fish. But I can't give this place another chance. I will say, the corporate office wrote me back offering a gift card. I might give another location a chance, but not the westgate. Not until that manager is gone or retrained on what customer service is. One positive is with the place being ran like it is, it will be gone soon. Hopefully the next tenant does better."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. It's a must visit whenever I'm in Las Vegas. There are several locations and they all kick ass!! My favorite is the hot and juicy fresh crawfish or shrimp. The frozen crawfish isn't worth it to me. So just get more shrimp if they are out of the fresh crawfish."}
{"text":"Omg I freaking love hot n juicy!! I had 2 pounds of snow crab one garlic butter with baby spice and the hot n juicy flavor with mild spice to freaking die for!!! Ate here twice while in Vegas!! Definitely will be back again!!!! Staff was pretty cool too!"}
{"text":"Here's a tip: While perusing the menu, order a side-sized sausage or 1/2 lb. shrimp with the sauce and heat you think you'll like to try it out. That's what we did, getting the medium-hot Hot 'n Juicy. The sausage was very good and the sauce spot-on what we wanted. Then we ordered crawfish, shrimp, a soft-shell crab basket, a catfish basket, and a side of corn fritters. The crawfish and shrimp were fun--you dump them sauce-and-all on the table and have at it--but what I'll order again for sure are the baskets and corn fritters, which were all lightly battered and cooked to perfection, and the sausage. There's a nice selection of beers at $3 (happy hour, I presume), service was really good and friendly, music was loud but complemented the ambiance, and there's a parking garage within a short walk. (I forgot to ask if they validate parking, but I should have: parking was $8.)"}
{"text":"This actually appeared to be a good place to eat. Walked in at 11:54 (per IPhone) was told that we could not be seated until 12:00 noon, as that was the posted business hours. Sounds reasonable. Walked outside to pull up menu on phone. While waiting, three individuals walked in three minutes later and were seated. Hmmm. Wasn't about the wait but hey, what the heck. Plenty of other restaurants in the area. Now seating party of two!"}
{"text":"The best server I ever had, Lemonade , she was very nice and taking a good care of us. First we sat down we didnt have to wait for that long after we got seated. She just came to us and asked if she could get anything beside water. Here she just made our day already"}
{"text":"Recommend it!  Warning, it gets messy when eating here! But worth it!  Also try dessert! Deep Fried Brownies!  Clean and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was great. Love the fact that you can get messy and not everyone will look at you weird. The waitresses we're ok. I had the fried shrimp basket and it was yummy. The cajun fries we're so yummy but they fried my mouth but I couldn't stop eating them.  My husband had the craw fish and then the shrimp. I wasnt a fan of the craw fish (too much work for to little food) but the shrimp was soo good. Also the corn fritters are to die for. It's definitely a place to try and not everyone is going to love."}
{"text":"My family and I love seafood, and this location of Hot N Juicy has become one of our favorite spots for great cajun style seafood. Not only is the food always delicious, the staff never disappoints. Everyone is always catering to your needs and extremely attentive. Because we like this place so much it ends up being one of the spots we go to on holidays like Mother's Day. Fair warning, this place is so good that on days like that it will be packed and with a bit of a wait. However, the manager Andraya and her well ran crew  make you feel important which makes the entire experience that much better. I highly recommend this restaurant, it never disappoints. If it's not already, this will become one of your favorite spots also! Try the brownies!"}
{"text":"This is one of my go-to best dining experiences. What I mean by that is that this place is so awesome, when I am having a bad dining experience, my mind sends me visions of this place to soften the blow and make me feel better. This place is one of my food nirvanas."}
{"text":"Love Hot n Juicy. Love it even more than Boiling Crab. The last time we ate here, which was last month, there were like 4 rocks in our bag of clams. They gave us a discount for the weight of the rocks, otherwise everything was bomb. Great service too."}

{"text":"This was my first time coming to this one being in the Las Vegas area and it was pretty good.   I liked their seasoning and their Cajun fries were pretty good. I got pound of shrimp with hot and juicy seasoning mild and it was good. My friend got their fried shrimp and I got to try it and that was pretty good. The breading was the best.  If I'm ever in the area again I will probably go with the calamari seeing as it looked good. The Cajun fries were also good.   Also had pretty good service which I liked. All in all I would go back next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"there needs to be a spicy level between med n spicy.. picked it up twice togo back to back days.. first day was so good but it was super spicy.. their frozen cf was not bad at all.. 2nd day they had live ones but from calif.. got the med hot n juicy flavor.. not spicy enough and the calif cf just wasnt as good.. alot of guts though that was good =) too bad the one back home is so far"}
{"text":"yummmmmmmmmm always a hit never a miss.. well so far.. they def are the best ive ever had.. the hollywood spot just isnt the same.. this place..fresh or frozen.. the sauce is just amazing.. i need to remember that i should get the hot instead of medium.. the hot is already super spicy but the medium is not .. they need something inbetween.. the fries were amazing.. so were the oysters.. we were seated right away.. so glad that there's no wait.."}
{"text":"Ok it was our first time here when we entered we were greeted by our waiter and he was friendly. So we ordered 2 pounds of crawfish hot and spicy medium spice and one pound of garlic butter shrimp oh and a chicken wing basket. The chicken wings were great esp the cajun frys :D. Than came our order. The crawfish were great but i felt like the crawfish werent fresh but the sauce saved it. The shrimp were good and garlicky :D i will plan to come back here Im still thinking about the hot n juicy sauce be warned it will stay on ur fingers for a while"}
{"text":"This place is VERY good. I went there for the very first time today and overall I had a great experience. The staff was super friendly, the food was actually very good, when I was on the website to see what they had it did not seem appealing; but the food said it all. It was interesting the fact that the food comes in a bag but there is a reason why that is; the food is super messy ! But VERY GOOD!    The only complaint I have about this is the fact that they open up at 12:00pm which I wish they open up earlier for lunch.  Overall, if you have not been here, you must go !"}
{"text":"I love the food in this place I've been here 3 times. But all 3 times servers was terrible. Food was great the only reason I gave it 3 stars is because of my servers. Last time I went we ordered rice and it took 45 minutes for the rice to finally be served on our table and everyone else got theirs, we spoke to 3 servers to get a rice. A simple rice. And when we order our servers never seem to pay Attention."}
{"text":"Definitely worth the cab ride from the strip!  Two of us shared. 2 lbs of crawfish 2 baskets of sweet potato fries Ordered a second piece of corn on the cob because the first one was so yummy.  Ordered the mild special seasoning and it was pretty spicy still.  Warning: Your hands will smell like garlic for days if you're not careful! But it is worth it."}
{"text":"The food is amazing! Tastes just like authentic food from New Orleans! I love that you get to pick what type of food you want, how much you want, the type of flavoring you get and how spicy you want it. I love getting all four seasonings at the hottest level you can get. The mussels, crawfish and sausage are so delicious and the sides that are available are a great balance to your meal. The prices are so reasonable and the staff is nice. It's neat how you eat the food, the table is covered in plastic for easy clean up and they bring your food out in bags and you get a bib and gloves because it will get messy (In a fun way!). Everyone should go try this place once at least just for the experience!"}
{"text":"its ok... i had about 1 pound of crab, a pound of shrimp, a pound of crawfish, and a pound of lobster. For the price of having to peel and crush and squish food out... its just was not worth the money. oh and the bloody mary was spicy as hell. enjoy"}
{"text":"I first came to this place after watching Adam Richmond get his grub on during an episode of Man Vs. Food. Now, I come here every time I visit Vegas.  The food is great. Salty, garlic-y, spicy. I know that this place is known for their crawfish, but I usually get two pounds of shrimp when I get here. Mostly because I feel like shrimp has more meat on it. Two pounds usually fills up about two people.  I get it to-go because I feel like I can eat a lot cleaner at home. That's just a personal preference though. Also, I have a McDonalds right next to my house, so I usually pick up large fries from there too. Dipping the fries in the sauce is bomb.  If you're a seafood lover like me, then next time you're in Vegas, you need to drop by here. You'll be thanking me when you walk through those doors."}
{"text":"Crawfish  Mild and spicy  8/10  Sources was yummy and juicy  Corn I like the most  Included prawns, crawfish and sausage crawfish not a lot of meat  ???????????????? ???? #foodie#lasvegasfood#foodinspiration#foodexplorer#foodjournal#foodblogger#seattlefoodie#foodtraveler#fooddiary#foodporn#???#foodforthought#foodlover#foodvideo#foodshare#foodinstragram"}
{"text":"If you like southern style seafood then this is the place. The food does not disappoint, it's fresh fast and absolutely awesome!!"}
{"text":"This place was just OK.   After eating at SO CAL CRAWFISH in California, it's hard to compete.  I just love the flavoring at SO CAL CRAWFISH!  Hot N Juicy Crawfish was.....eh???"}
{"text":"I saw this place on Food network and was surprised we have this famous Cajun restaurant here in Las Vegas. I decided to take my fiancee for a never-before crawfish experience.   We were there on Tuesday night about 8:00PM and there was plenty of open seating. After we were seated, we were given the first-timer instruction on how to order.   We ordered 2lbs of crawfish(hot & juicy mild) included 1 potato & 1 corn, 1 lb of shrimp (galic butter mild), 1 soft shell crab basket include Cajun fries, and 2 cokes. We really wanted to order oysters but they ran out, that's why we ordered the shrimp.   The taste of the spices was very good, and garlic butter was wonderful. We both loved the seasoning very much. But there was one problem for us, we realized that we don't like crawfish. We never had crawfish before this night, at least not a properly prepared crawfish meal. We manage to finish all 2 lbs of it because the spices was just that good. On the other hand, the shrimp was so good, the large amount of garlic in that buttery sauce made the shrimp so sweet and tasty. We just can not stop eating the shrimp!!! And the soft shell? nothing worth mentioning, except for the Cajun fries we dipped and ate with the sauce in the crawfish/shrimp bags.  The whole experience was pretty good, the whole meal cost us $57 which I thought was a little high. We decided if we go back, we would order shrimp only and call to make sure they have oysters before we go again."}
{"text":"Never seems to disappoint me. To save money and time I call in my order and pick it up. It much better to enjoy it home In front of the tv and suck all the juices loud."}
{"text":"Try rolling their chicken wings in their sauce that ends up at the bottom of the shrimp/crawfish/seafood bags!  =D"}
{"text":"I have to say, this is the first place Adam Richman got right. The quality, the value and the atmosphere are well worth the trip off the strip. We had 2 lbs of crawfish, 1/2 lb of shrimp, 1 lb mussels, 1 dozen oysters, Cajun fries, drinks and it was $90 including tip. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I thought the food was flavorful and tasty. But Im not sure if it was very healthy because I had major hershey squarts (diarrhea) after. The waitress was really nice, but we felt a bit decieved by her. She offered sauce on the side, without informing us that we were gonna be charged for it. And, once she delivered our food, she disappeared. So when we wanted to order more food and get our drinks refilled, no one came over to help us. We were disappointed. It was a bit pricey for the product/service we received. Never going again."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Sunday and it was pretty busy. Only reason this place gets 3 stars is because of the absolutely awful service we received. It took 20 minutes to get a drink at the bar while we waited For our table. Once we finally got sat, it took 30 minutes just to get waters and after the waitress took our order, we watched her take the orders of the tables next to us before putting our food in which is TOTALLY fine. I am also a server/bartender so I get it but it took her an actual 30 minutes just to put our food in!!! And then she forgot the oysters. The food itself was good. Doesn't compare to angry crab though. In total it took 2 hours just to get our food. Probably won't be coming back here..."}
{"text":"Food is good, the service could be better but a lot of it has to do with them always being busy being in the middle of Westgate.  My wife loves coming so this is a regular spot for us to come as we live very close to this location. The pricing isn't bad for being good seafood but is on the higher end.  The food doesn't take long to come out and they have plenty of seating inside or in their patio area, try to avoid game days or holidays but that goes for most of Westgate.    I recommend getting their shrimp and crawfish and make sure you get a corn or two!"}
{"text":"Went here while bodyguarding a client. I'm a spoiled man who has all the dirty work done for him before the shrimp comes out but here, I was forced into a corner to eat here and on top of that, they ordered for me. Really wasn't into heads and legs on shrimp before I walked in the door but let me tell you that my opinion had soon changed. The food was amazing, spicy, and hands on. The shrimp bag and sausage was THEE best combo I've had in a while. Had some fried shrimp also and it was good. Wonderful waitresses although I couldn't keep my eyes off of one in perticular, and this waitress made me try crawfish which wasn't bad either. Great experience. Great environment. Great food. Great time. Will always eat here in Vegas especially if I catch this waitress working"}
{"text":"More For Less!!!  If you are a local and have visited the other locations in Las Vegas, you'll know what I mean. If you are a visitor with a car or transportation... it may be best for you to go to either of the other locations to get the TRUE Hot N Juicy experience.   Coming to the new location, we expected the experience to be better than, or at least similar to the other locations.   However, the prices were a little more at this location, but that wasn't the problem. EVERYTHING they brought to the table contained next to NO sauce. We were treating my niece for her birthday and she ordered The Experience which came with a butt load of items... and it too had almost NO SAUCE! So, we had to order extra sauce for each order. Finally, my sister ordered a pound of snow crab and it come with only 5 legs.   We spoke to the host to inquire about the increase in prices and to address the lack of sauce and the missing crab legs. His only justification was, \"Well, this is The Strip.\" We were not satisfied with his explanation. So, he said he'd speak to the lead server. Unfortunately,  he came back to say his lead server said there was NOTHING they could do. So, we asked for the Manager. His response was, \"Well, the Manager is a little too busy right now.\" We told him we'd wait!   Eventually,  the manager come to the table and he agreed that there was no way that those 5 pieces amounted to 1 pound and that each bag should have contained more sauce. So, he offered to compensate by taking the extra sauces off the bill and to prepare the other half of the missing crab legs (it took FOREVER to come out though).   In the end... we paid our $160, and we will NOT be coming back or making recommendations for this location."}
{"text":"Similar to Angry Crab if you've been to Chicago. Only negative I have is that all seafood has heads on. Coming from Midwest I'm not accustomed to going places and not being able to get headless shrimp. Only reason I won't give it 5 stars."}
{"text":"It has been a struggle deciding between three and four stars, but I have settled on four. I feel this place is slightly over-hyped and perhaps part of my let down was attributed to such high expectations due to this hype. I expected to be blown away, and instead I was just barely satisfied.   We ordered 1lb of shrimp in their signature sauce medium spicy, half a dozen oysters, cajun fries and bowl of rice. I also had two beers. The tab was very reasonable for the amount of food we received, hence why I opted for four instead of three star rating. I felt that the price was fair for the quality of the food. The sauce was good as was the shrimp. The fries were nothing special, but the cajun seasoning was very very good. The oysters were tiny and not memorable. The rice was great with the sauce from the shrimp. Overall, the meal was fine but I would not seek this place out again or feel the desire to return unless the circumstance calls for it (friends who want to try it, I am in the area and rest of Chinatown has burned down, etc)."}

{"text":"I love this place so much the food is really good and if you love seafood youll definitly enjoy this place i recommend this to anyboydy!!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here for the first time tonight and our waiter was helpful.  We ordered Calamari, King Crab, Shrimp, Fried Fish, and Cajun Fries and reg. Fries  I had the Calamari - Lousianna - Mild. I was thinking ok mild is not that bad but omg it was a weebit spicy for me and wanted to dip my tounge in that cold dr. pepper soda lol but that louisianna sauce was yummy!  I'd wanna come back but as I got home I had an allergic reaction. My neck started to itch and the top of my left hand was getting swollen. Ugh. Well, I'll wait awhile to go back.  We got free t-shirts though. They were made during the superbowl and had extras so we took 6 (free) t-shirts. That was cool!"}
{"text":"Hot N Juicy and MESSY Good!  They're one week into opening over here at Sansone Park Place right next to East Ocean to be exact.   For virgin HNJ Crawfish diners here's the drill:  1. Pick Your Cravings...Market Prices per pound. Shrimp is the only one you can order 1/2 pound of. Make note of the list of current prices posted as you enter.  2. Pick Your Spice Level. ..Mild-Extra Spicy  3. Pick Your Seasoning. ..Cajun, Lemon Pepper, Garlic Butter, and their house blends from what I remember.   4. Roll up your sleeves, tie the bib, and put on the plastic gloves provided for you. There's no dishes or utensils so just dig in!  Since it was my first time here my server guided me thru the menu. My pick: Steamed Shrimp ..Seasoning: Garlic Butter...Spice Level ..mild ..thats all my palate can take. My server read off the sides and Corn Fritter aka Hush Puppies is what I picked. .I don't remember nor did I really didn't pay attention to what else or how much everything was ..my bad.   My order of shrimp came out in a plastic bag nice and HOT.   The shrimp is pretty meaty and when you sink your teeth into it's JUICY!  The MESSY part of is that you get to eat with your hands and do the work  peeling the skin off the shrimp. It's messy but  buttery garlicky good!  The staff did a good job tag teaming. Host greeted and seated everyone in line pretty quick. The servers did great.  I was constantly checked up on. It was a fairly short wait for the main entrée to come out. Docked star though because side order came out midway through my meal. I had noted that fried items were a problem after reading some of the reviews here. Looks like the back house  still short a fryer.   The dining area is pretty big. Seating wise it's great for groups.  You have your choice of sitting in either booth or table that's covered in sheet of plastic.   Good thing for laid back atmosphere. Cause using no utensils can get messy. NOTE: There's a sink located just outside the restroom so you can clean . Spent just under twenty bucks for lunch. Super  deal for my meal!"}

{"text":"Oh boy, where do I start with this place. I am signing up to Yelp just to complete this review about my experience tonight... The server - Extremely rude. It was clear that he was overwhelmed as it was busy. However, there is no excuse when I attempted to ask a simple question about the menu that he snapped at me, saying that he needed to complete his orders in sequence organize his ticket.There was an awkward silence at our table after that. I explained that I had a question, he allowed me to ask it. He should have listened to what I had to say first,and not made assumptions. I ordered Sprite, and my first cup came half full. Had to ask another server for a refill when I completed it after four sips. I asked for snow crab legs, spicy, and the server asked if I was sure if I wanted it spicy. Why is it on the menu if you are going to question my order? Yes, I can handle it.  The service - Mediocre. It took an hour and twenty minutes to have the food served to the table, and that was done by piece meal. Who wants their sides first, and then their main entree thirty minutes later? Three people in our party came in thirty minutes later, and they received our food before I did. It should seriously take no more than 10-15 minutes to cook crab legs, tops, not almost an hour and a half.  The food - Wish I knew, I never got to experience it. After waiting the hour and twenty minutes, the food runner served what he thought to be the last dish, and he asked if we needed anything else. I said that I have still not received my food. The waiter then shows up and asked me what I ordered again. I stated two pounds of snow crab. He messed up and wrote blue crab. Then miraculously, another runner comes in with two pounds of blue crab while we are discussing his error. When reiterated that my order was wrong, they both just stared back like they expected me to take the food anyway. I was completely disgusted by this point, and cancelled my order. He walked off without so much as an apology.  I haven't seen service this bad in years. You couldn't pay me to come back."}
{"text":"My husband raved about this place the last time he was in Vegas so naturally he wanted to bring me here on our trip this past weekend.  It did not disappoint!  I'm a big fan of Cajun seafood and have heard great things about Hot N Juicy.  For 2 people we had 3 pounds of crawfish, 1 lb of shrimp and 1 lb of snow crab legs and only left with 1 lb of crawfish to go, which we ended up finishing at the hotel.  We didn't bother ordering any sauces other than their signature Hot N Juicy in spicy and ordered the extra spicy on the side as a dipping sauce.  No complaints about the service.  We're from CT and cannot wait until the NYC location opens up."}
{"text":"This review is based on the fact I only order shrimp and fried chicken tenders or chicken wings. For whatever reason, this location has the best shrimp, always fresh, sweet, and never overlooked. I always get 1lb (or more!) of shrimp, with hot n juicy spices and medium heat, and it never disappoints. Perfect blend of spices, lots of garlic, and a ton of butta! Chicken tenders/wings are a perfect way to balance the heat. Definitely a place where you have to okay with getting down and dirty to eat and be okay breathing garlic for the rest of the evening. Food has always been consistent times I've been.   Service is a a different story and never has been consistent. I've had really great service, where my drink never reaches the bottom, or like tonight where we asked 4 times for ranch and twice for drink refills. Fortunately the food is good and the shrimp keeps bringing me back!"}
{"text":"Like the idea of wearing a plastic bib with a pocket at the bottom? You know, like the ones you put on infants to catch everything? How about wearing silly giant plastic gloves? If you like playing with your food, ripping shrimp heads off, peeling the shells, and working for your meal, come here.  This is the place to make a gigantic mess that is simply wrapped up in the plastic table cloth and disposed of.  You have wonderful choices of seafood; lobster, black or green mussels, clams, Dungeness, Blue, Snow or King crab legs, shrimp or crawfish- all by the pound. Choose the seasoning you want it cooked in ( butter, garlic, lemon pepper) and then the level of spice. Sides include but are not limited to rice, Hawaiian rolls, corn on the cob, potatoes, etc.   The moment we stepped in the door we were greeted enthusiastically, led to our choice of tables, ordered, and our food arrived unbelievably quick. The restaurant filled up equally fast. Do come early and bring a big appetite.  I don't understand why we don't have a Hot N Juicy Crawfish in the Coachella Valley, CA desert?  I believe there's one in Hollywood and Orange County.  They're plentiful in the Las Vegas area. But then again, I have noticed that whenever something becomes popular in LV, it eventually makes its way here.  Whoever opens the first one in the greater Palm Springs area is going to make a killing.  I double dog dare you!"}
{"text":"So im sure they hate being compared to boiling crab but since I was originally told it was better, I had high expectations. The one person in the group who hadnt been to BC loved it. The whole shebang at bc is definitely better/more garlicky than the hnj. Crawfish at BC was much much better than here. The shrimp is about the same. Mussels were just ok here, sausage was kinda dry, the crab was pretty good. Their louisana sauce was pretty watery but my friend liked it. The fresh oysters were also pretty good.  service - really inattentive. We had to ask multiple times for things like water, missing sides, and to clean up a huge pile of plates we stacked up to be cleared for our second round of ordering. And this was with the restaurant less than half full!"}
{"text":"So went back and they've improved a lot. Everyone seems to work as a team and someone was always watching over our table. I'm glad cause it's delicious and conveniently located!"}
{"text":"Oh so good!  Fun experience, definitely be prepared to get messy.  It's a consistent craving of mine."}
{"text":"Food is ok.  Looooong wait and when the food came it was all wrong. Two people in our group got their food a third had to wait another 20 minutes. No drink refills without begging multiple times. Female server was terrible. The other server (Anthony) was awesome.  It's rough because they have to split tips.  Avoid this place."}
{"text":"YUM YUM YUM!!!!! Came here with my friend and booooy it was delicious!!! You will be provided with bibs and gloves. The gloves are much needed, otherwise your hands will smell like seafood. They're not very durable, so you'll need to switch them out periodically while eating. Had 1/2 pound of shrimp with a pound of Alaskan King Crab Legs. Both with mild hot and juicy seasoning. Perfect seasoning, I'm in love. I would give them 5 stars if the price was a little lower. For the Alaskan King Crap, it was $28/lb. I didn't really care for the shrimp because it came with the whole body (head and body in the shell). Although it was all tasty, the shrimp head just wasn't appealing to me. Other than that, the place was clean and we didn't wait long for a table. Unfortunately, the night we came, they were pretty understaffed and it was definitely noticeable. I will definitely be returning in the near future (but maybe to the other location instead)!!!!"}
{"text":"Love love love!!! The peel and eat shrimp with their house sauce is the best. Their heat levels are higher than normal--mild has a nice kick and medium is hot hot hot! Scared to try the hot! French fries dipped in the sauce are heavenly. The worst part--you have to go home and shower and do laundry, the garlic and spice is so strong I can smell it in my clothes and hair. Nonetheless it's totally worth it!! I love this restaurant."}
{"text":"I had a great experience..my party and I came a hr before close..the staff was kind friendly attentive and the food was great..hot juciy and fresh..and the drinks..they were fine by me..so 5 stars espcially for the staff..and Ms Gracie..u are the best.."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! If you love seafood and sucking meat out of shells this is the right place! The crawfish is sooooooooo good, their sauces are so tasty and you can decide on the spice level you'd like.  They sell the seafood per pound, in a bag, with the sauce of your choice.  They offer crab, shrimp, lobster, mussels, and crawfish.  I really crave this once a while::: My 2 pounds of crawfish in the lemon pepper or the house sauce, spicy and 2 or 3 Blue Moon beers....Bam! it doesn't get better than this! Be prepare to stink like spices after eating here for the rest of the day! lol"}
{"text":"LOVE HOT N JUICY. But not this location SPECIFICALLY. I work in the restaurant industry, consistency is key. Multiple times I've been to this location due to convenience from where I work on the strip & this place is absolute garbage. The bathrooms are disgusting, the servers attitudes are just as bad. Whenever I grab food from this location I take it to go so I don't have to deal with the unkept service & cleanliness here. Good job Eastern location & Spring Mtn./ Decatur location. Always great service @ those spots. 2 stars for this location because when I do tough it out & order to go, it's still delish."}
{"text":"The food was really good but the service was quite a disaster. The servers looked like they didn't know what they were doing and were constantly conversing amoungst themselves. It took a while for the servers to notice our raised hands. We asked for the check and they told us that they lost the tickets. I'm disappointed at the service but the food was delicious."}
{"text":"Pretty decent price for seafood cuz they make u get down n dirty. I really like the Louisiana style broth bc it doesn't leave you smelling like garlic all night. Service has always been great here n it's a fun stop before the movies.. Great for high  protein low carb diets.. High sodium tho"}
{"text":"This place is fun and the food is delicious, once you get the shell off anyways. You order your food and it comes out in bags filled with the shrimp or crawfish you chose and a medley of corn cob, potatoes, sausages, and some other things. The food can be pretty hot. You almost burn your fingers a bit if you don't let the food cool off for a few minutes."}
{"text":"Super busy but worth the wait. The only downside is the fact that your clothes and hands will smell like old bay seasoning for a few days. Visited while on vacation and I couldnt wear those jeans again for the weekend... BUT the food was GREAT!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This was a pretty cool location.  The entire staff was awesome.  The food was good and the service was better.  Our order was brought piping hot.  The restaurant was clean and I'm not sure about the ladies room as I didn't need to use it.  If you like Hot N Juicy Crawfish I recommend this location."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!  Everything's great but the king crab and snow crab can be a lil too salty sometimes.  If you love  seafood and don't mind getting messy you gotta try this place out!"}
{"text":"Good service and great food. We had the oysters, catfish w/Cajun fries and of course the shrimp (hot & juicy)all were good. A nice addition to the strip will definitely make this one of my go to spot when in Vegas."}
{"text":"It's a fun experience. You get your hands dirty & work for your food in a fun way. Very casual place & when you walk in the aromas hit you in the face.  My first time & it was great! Staff is also very friendly."}
{"text":"This place is a direct copy of The Boiling Crab restaurants in So Cal.  Everything on the menu is almost exactly the same even the different spices.  The one unique thing that we noticed was that this place had a fried soft shell crab platter, which you only get like 1 crab or just barely more.  The shrimp didn't seem as fresh as what you'd get at Boiling Crab as most of the heads were falling off the shrimp in our bags.  The fried fish platter also was on the smaller side, 3 pieces of fish.  The cajun fries were not what you'd expect, it looked like they sprinkled on the spices as they were in the basket so the spices are not really distributed evenly on each fry. The service was a step down from Boiling Crab, it's slower, they aren't really on the ball for drink refills.  Overall the food was still pretty good, if I could give it 3.5 stars I would, but for me 4 stars is a place I'd recommend unconditionally.  I'm not sure if I would recommend Hot N Juicy Crawfish, because I know how much better it could be."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I am a boiling crab fan. I will try to leave out the comparisons... keyword is try.  Here we are in Vegas... We stumble upon hot & juicy. Of course our first thought was whole shabang?!? In Vegas?!? What could be better. Sadly to say it is not.   We beat the rush so we were seated right away. I was curious about lousiana style which now I'm thinkin is plain....? My friend got the hot & juicy special. For both of us it was lacking, we like our food drenched with flavorful sauce. If ur a dry food kinda person you'll probably like it. I thought the shrimps were good... had leftover seafood taste tho. We actually liked our corn it was pretty sweet. I order a side of extra sauce which could have saved the whole situation except it had this weird plastic taste in it.  The service was good. They were attentive.    Overall. It was ok. Quality of the shrimp & corn *thumbs up* The sauce *thumbs down*"}
{"text":"Fiance and I saw this place on the Man Vs. Food ...and we had to try it on our next trip to vegas. We went the day after New Years Day the place was empty. I was kind of scared we were not at the right location into the menu mentioned that they had been on Man vs. Food..Everything you order is by lb and the price is based on the market price. We ordered kind lobster legs $ 26.99/lb, crawfish $ 6.99/lb, and shrimp $12.99/lb along with some cajun fries. We went w/ the waitress recommendation and ordered all our food with the Hot N' Juicy sauce, spicy. Food was delicious except the crawfish they had warned us it was not fresh, which may explained why it tasted a bit salty. Still good but salty... Overall experience was great. Will come on our next trip to Vegas (may skip the crawfish). Beware...eating here you will get messy, they give you plastic table cover, bids and gloves to eat (eventually you dish the gloves & start getting dirty). You will smell after leaving this place..."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Great food, great service! Will be back!  Very different experience, crazy fun."}
{"text":"We are frequent visitors to Las Vegas and have really started to find our way around the place.  When we saw HNJC on Man v. Food we were excited to try a new \"locals\" place.  When you walk in you start drooling right away, the aromas coming out of the kitchen permeate the whole restaurant and it is awesome!  Every time we go to LV now the kids want to go to HNJC and so do I!   You will get messy and you'll smell like HNJC for a while after you leave.    We always order the Hot n Juicy mild crawfish.  We all love spicy food but they aren't kidding when they say the mild is pretty hot.  My husband, 13 year old, and I can stand the medium but our 10 year old can't.  That's ok though because the mild has more than enough spice and we'd probably prefer it anyway.  Sometimes we get the shrimp, it is very tasty and just as messy as the crawfish.  I prefer the HotNJuicy medium for shrimp.  We had the king crab once, it was fabulous.  We've tried most of the flavors but now always go with the HotNJuicy Special."}
{"text":"I craved Boiling Crab but this is a good alternative when in Vegas.   Not as good as boiling crab in LA. Corn is too soft. The pound of shrimp didn't have a lot of sauce, which equates to less drenchness of savory dee-lish.   1 pound gives about 20 shrimps. Dry. Everything is at market price, makes sense since this is the desert.   Fun for big groups and party. I would go here as both a local or someone not wanting to eat buffets on the Strip."}
{"text":"Great seafood!  Service from one server,  not saying any names, was the worst experience ever from h & j! Took allot for me to keep my cool on this one particular server.  If the seafood wasn't so good I'd give this place 3 stars. Took them 40 min to get our food out, and on top of that they kept forgetting orders!  All together or took over 2hrs to dine here. .  Never again,  I will be ordering to go from now on in this location.  Ps, to the server I dislike,  stop acting so fake cause everyone knows it."}
{"text":"Wanna try something different, have lots of fun eating and just have a good night out?  Then grab some friends, your wallet and head on over the Hot N Juicy Crawfish.  This is a place that you have to try ... once .. just for the experience.  Went on a weeknight for the experience.  Order the dungenous crab (they were out), blue crab (they were out too) and settled with: crawfish, shrimp and alaskan king crab, and an order of cajun fries.  The dinner might have been better with dungenous crab, but overall was just OK.  The crawfish -- there isn't anything there.  So little meat.  Brings back memories of  \"Where's the beef\" commercials. The shrimp was good and the king crab was OK.  You can tell that the crab was frozen.  The cajun fries were good and spicy.  Remember to dress comfortably & wash your hands when you get there.  You eat with your hands here and there are lots of paper towels on the table for you to use.  Having tried Crawfish, I probably won't return on the next trip to LV."}
{"text":"Viva Las Vegas!!! This has become my favorite restaurant in Vegas! I go there every time. Fresh crawfish flown in every day...shrimp and crab legs that are to die for, tender clams and the Hot N Juicy sauce (I prefer this sauce in hot but you get a choice of sauces & heat level) just covers everything with love!   All the seafood is served in bags so it keeps absorbing the flavor of the sauce. The crawfish comes with a potato and corn in the bag, but you can get it added to everything else. I recommend adding these as the corn gets the flavor of the sauce and the potato absorbs the sauce. I also like getting a bowl of rice as well and you can pour the sauce on it!   Yes, you are peeling and ripping your food apart with your bare hands, so ladies, if you do not want to mess up your manicure, they do provide gloves. I went brazenly bare last time though and it was a lot easier to eat and when I was done all the sauce washed off easily.  They now have 2 locations... I prefer the one that is furthest from the strip. The one closer is very, very loud because of the building. It's like being in a tin can, so take the extra 5 minutes and head a little further up Spring Mountain.  I cannot wait for my next Hot N Juicy fix!"}
{"text":"Hot-n-Juicy never disappoints us! It is a regular stop for us. We share a pound of shrimp (head on...best flavor and tender) with all flavors mixed and we prefer it spicy. And don't sleep on their po' boys...they are delicious..fresh bread... and if you close your eyes while eating it you may think you are at a New Orleans gas station (yep, the best ones come from the gas station/convenient mart's). Try them when in Vegas (one location on the strip). #stlmetrofoodie"}
{"text":"I went here during my first visit to Vegas and it was my favorite part! I'm returning in January and after I check in to my hotel, this is the first place I'm headed.   My boyfriend and I each ordered two lbs--mine was mild and he ordered medium. I'm a heat sissy, and I found my pretty spicy. There was so much garlic and flavor I couldn't believe it!  The only bad thing was that I never got a refill on my tiny soda, and I really needed one!"}
{"text":"After reading quite a few good reviews I decided to try it out. The atmosphere was comfortable, we were seated right away, and our waitress was very friendly and attentive. We were given some samples, which was fun! Overall the food tasted great! My husband got the king crab legs, I got the fried shrimp basket, and our daughter had the chicken tenders. The Cajun fries definitely have some spice to them, but I enjoyed it. My husband was put off that everything was served in bags (except those listed on the menu as baskets or po'boy sandwhiches), so just be aware that you will get a plastic bib, gloves, and the food might be in a bag. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone, but I would make sure they knew about the bag thing."}
{"text":"Worse service ever called in a order get there my order not right she charge me extra for the item she forgot then goes back to the kitchen and still didn't get my order correct had a attitude about fixing my order just worse service especially for the price you pay for the food I would expect better service"}
{"text":"Been here a few times and normally we have absolutely wonderful service and food. This last visit on the other hand has turned us off from wanting to go back. Our main dish was $50 and was supposed to include 2 clusters of grab legs. We got 1 with 3 small crab legs. The food tasted off and not completely cooked. Plus the seasoning was wrong. Once the waitress came back we asked her about the crab legs and told her the food tasted off. She sits our check down on the table and says next time we needed to say something earlier.  And they would recook it. Well if she had bothered to come back and check on us we would have let her know earlier."}
{"text":"I have been to a couple different locations thru the U.S. and this one was a let down. I talked it up to my friends saying it's going to be the best crab legs they ever had and try and i was wrong.... They were overcooked and dry in the inside. I barely got anything from my meal but shells. The waitress only apologized for 3 meals of crab legs - each one a total let down."}
{"text":"I had a chance to visit this place while in Vegas over Memorial Day weekend. I saw it featured on Man Vs Food... It's tucked away in Chinatown. The ladies greet you all at once... Very nice... They seat you then hand you the very short and straight to the point menu. I ordered the crawfish.. They were a bit pricey compared to Texas at $10.99lb and I also ordered the snow crab legs which were $16.99lb... The sweet potato Cajun fries were amazing as well!. They don't serve wine or champagne by the glass so I had to purchase an entire bottle for $24.99. I ordered the hot and juicy special and the spice level was HOT! They were awesome!"}
{"text":"My friend A'lene took me and my kids to this place similar to Boiling Crab in the OC. We ordered the garlic lemon flavored shrimp (mild) and cups of rice. The shrimp were huge and the sauce is to die for.  A'lene recommended pouring the sauce to the rice, twas perfect. I almost ate the whole bag of shrimp, almost forgot I was sharing it. hahaha  The only complaint I have is the 25 minute wait and the noise level in the restaurant. Other than that, I highly recommend this restaurant. I could eat here everyday."}
{"text":"My husband and I like food somewhat spicy, with a little kick. We ordered the mild crawfish and shrimp thou because we heard it was kinda spicy. Man, it was ridiculously spicy. MILD????? Both of us could not take it. Do u know when the food is so spicy u cant even enjoy or taste anything? Like that. We were so disappointed. The mild was crazy spicy, Im glad we didnt bring family with us cause they dont like spicy food and that \"mild\" would've been very embarrassing. Beware of the very spicy food. If u like very spicy u will enjoy it. Not us, we are not going back."}
{"text":"Good restaurant if you are craving spicy seafood. First, do not wear nice clothes if you  are eating at Hot N Juicy. You are using your hands most of the time and the plastic bib can come of easily, so expect some splashed sauce on you clothing. I always go for their shrimp with Hot n Juicy sauce. The shrimps are fresh and huge. The sauce suites the the shrimp meat very well. I also love their seasoned fries.   The parking and customer service is also very good."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service! First time eating crawfish from the shell & the supervisor took the time to show us how to eat it. A one of a kind experience."}
{"text":"Service Good Flavor of sauce Good... kinda reminds me of Boiling Crab in San Jose, Ca though tastes better  Didn't get to try Fresh Crawfish ... called and was told there was fresh get there 5 minutes later no more left  BLAH  Will rate it higher when i go back and get to try out the FRESH craw until then ... everything else was good... ooo  THE SAUSAGES TASTE GOOD"}
{"text":"Never been to anyplace like this before and we are completely hooked! Now we wish that Las Vegas is only 10 minutes away. The place was cozy, very clean and our server was very gracious and attentive. The food A++++!!! We ordered 1/2 dozen oysters, a lb of blue crabs, shrimps, and  crawfish, a basket of soft shell crab with cajun fries, and three beers - for only $59. Unbelievable!!! (Yes, we were starving, we just came from the boneyard tour). You can never ever find anything affordable like this in the Bay Area! And the seasoning, hot n juicy in medium.. arrrghhh. so good!! i can't help dipping my fries and shrimps on this special sauce. Now hubby and I can't stop kicking ourselves for not going twice, but it's all good, we're going back to Vegas this Labor Day and Hot N Juicy is on top of our list!"}
{"text":"$12/lb of live crawfish, $22/lb of lobster. I had 1 lobster and 2 lbs of crawfish today and they both were a big disappointment. The meats were from dead crawfishes dead lobster. I just ate crawfishes from the boiling crab yesterday, the difference was very obvious. It was $1 more per lb at the boiling crab, not a big deal. I've had hot n juicy in Falls Church, VA. I wasn't impressed there and unfortunately this location is no difference."}
{"text":"we been here a couple times in the last month  the food is good there was only one time when our shrimp didnt come out cooked enough we understood because it was sooo packed in there.. sent it back and we got them to perfection we where really pleased!  sometimes service can be so so but most of the time its great the only thing i dislike is when i come in 10-15 before closing they seem upset even tho theres like 10 other tables in here...and they say let me see if where still seating...um its 15 till u close ? it says open so dont be so rude...I'd understand if its 10 than ok... or at least turn off the open sign.  anyways i still would recommend this places :-) better than bowling crab for sure.!"}
{"text":"Please open up a restaurant in Oregon!  I forgot our servers name but he was super friendly. He gave everyone fist bumps and was very helpful and patient for the newbies at our table. The food then came out very quickly!  The boils here are not exactly NOLA but it comes very close in terms of the flavor. Yesterday I got 1 lb of garlic butter shrimp (medium spice), 1 lb of Hot N Juicy flavor (all of the flavors mixed) snow crab (medium spice), and 1 lb of fresh Cajun flavored crawfish (medium spice). They were all SO good! I can't even say which flavor was better. We also added corn and potatoes, and our server hooked it up with an extra corn (which may have been a mistake but I'll take it). This was also the only Cajun restaurant I've been to that hands out gloves to the customers to peel the boils - super convenient for us.  The 3 pounds was $56 total... pretty spendy compared to the south. But I'm from Oregon and nothing there tastes as good so I'd definitely come back every time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"What can I say, but finger licking good!  The hubby had been here before on a seperate trip and always raved about this place and how \"once you eat here you can never eat at boiling crab or any other place again\".  Now I believe him!  The menu and format is the same, but their sauce is 100% times better. The spicy one is just the perfect level of savory, spicy all together in a bag of yummy goodness.  We wanted clams but they sold out to our dismay, so we got some mussells, shrimp, crayfish, corn, and etoufee. Crayfish didnt have much meat and was a bit small, but its good to suck the heads!   Everything was delicious and came out pipping hot. Service was friendly.  I WISH we had one of these in the bay area.  A must for foodies while in Vegas."}
{"text":"Poor service, small portions and bad management. There are too many other good restaurants to eat at, don't waste your time or hard earned money here. I had a gift card and their machine wasn't working but after trying to convince them, they finally honored it. Two of my crab legs were empty. I told my party that they were my witnesses and sure enough when I brought it to the staff's attention, they told me it was impossible! Finally they brought me some more crab legs. This place has drastically gone down hill in the past six months. I will never go there again nor will I recommend it to anyone again."}
{"text":"I've been to Boiling crab on Friday and was told Hot n Juicy was better.  So here's my review.  Food: Boiling crab's sauce to me seems to have more flavor.  The shrimp here didn't taste as fresh.  Maybe I came on a bad night?  The fried catfish was a disappointment as well.  Price:  Boiling Crab is a tad less expensive.  Not too much to make or break the deal.  Service:  Boiling Crab.  Our server was really friendly and attentive and funny.  Did I mention he was cute.  I may just come back for him. ;)  Hot n Juicy was friendly but our waitress seemed to be in a rush.  This was a Monday night.   Atmosphere:  Boiling crab was a lot bigger so I felt less Claustrophobic.    Alcohol:  This one goes to Hot n juicy.  They have a bigger selection on drinks.    Boiling Crab 4 - Hot N Juicy  1  3 stars.  Not terrible... But probably won't be coming back."}
{"text":"So this time around in Vegas, we decided to try things outside of our normal. So we walked into this place. Friendly greeting the moment you walk in followed by nice service. Our server even showed us how to properly eat crawfish. You get a bib and gloves and your bag of food is served. Fun experience and delicious flavors! We got the shrimp and crawfish with Cajun fries. Super good! I recommend it :)"}
{"text":"Saw this restaurant on the Travel Channel and had to try when we're in Vegas.  It was amazing!  First time trying crawfish so I can't compare but I wasn't impressed, we also had the shrimp, king crab and calamari...all were amazing!  The mild had a kick to it but I loved it.  Definitely would go back!  Only wished they opened a little earlier...11?"}
{"text":"The hubby and I went here last night it was our first time here so we was very excited.... everything was great we was sooo full when we left .... we got (8) wings which were tiny but soooo good only comes plain though with a side of ranch for $11 ... one pound of crabs ($23) ... two pounds of shrimp ... side of rice ($3)  ... Hawaiian rolls u get 3 for ($2) .... we order dozen sausages ($6) .... and it was (0.75) for every corn and potatoe you order !!!   We wanted oysters but they only came raw && we like it steam lol we ordered some to try it out a dozen was ($24) but we just couldn't eat it lol   We had got the hot n juicy flavor with extra spicy &&& I love it it was sooo spicy and good you definitely needed water lol   Ashley was great she really made our experience enjoyable.... we will be coming backkkk"}
{"text":"It was good because the staff is friendly. The prices are ok. The taste was ok. Overall three stars. Nothing extraordinarily special."}
{"text":"I can't wait to see you in Denver! The food was so good and so flavorful. The service was good, the atmosphere was cool. Every one's just as messy digging into their bags as you with a cajun grin. We tried all different bags and all of them were fire! We ordered more to take back to the hotel. Fire!"}
{"text":"it was okay.... nothing like boiling crab or crawdaddy's in SJ, CA though.  sauce was good... just not enough.... so expect to pay extra for more sauce otherwise it's hard to dip your shrimp.  my friend's crawfish had lots of dirt in it... so that was a big no no....   i'd rather go to boiling crab or crawdaddy's even if the wait is longer..."}
{"text":"I love hot n juicy, I prefer it better than other crawlfish places! As soon as I walk in, I smell the amazing seafood served here and it leaves my mouth watering. I don't think the corn is fresh, and most of the time I come here the crawl fishes are frozen.  I always order the one pound shrimp and it leaves me soooo full. Their rice goes great with the shrimp sauce! I love this place."}
{"text":"After reading the excellent yelp reviews, I drove down from LA for the day just to try this place.  I was craving some crawfish and finding good crawfish up here hasn't been easy lately.  So, I got in the new ride, picked up my companion, plugged in the iPod, and just hit the road. What a way to spend a Saturday.    OMG!!  Ultimately, although I wanted to eat more, I refrained from pigging out.  I stopped eating after I ate three pounds of crawfish...and yes I'm consoling myself with the fact that three pounds included the shells...yes, that's it!  And...no I didn't eat the shells.  So I really only ate maybe a pound or so of actual crawfish meat.  Anyway, the first two pounds were in the medium Cajun boil served with a corn cobbette and a potato.  The boil was flavorful with a light heat and the crawfish were of good size.  When I was done, I ordered another pound of crawfish in the spicy hot and juicy boil.  Great flavor, particularly with the garlic touch.  And those mudworms were large!  They looked like mini- lobsters.  I actually ate the claw meat, something I generally don't do given their small size.  After all, there is a limit to just how much work I want to do for a meal. Now, I know to just order the spicy boil flavors since I generally like foods with a high heat.  Before I forget, the sweet potato fries were good too.  I liked that our food server kept the coke cups full and the staff checked in often.   My companion ate the fried shrimp and the chicken wings with potato fries.  While he ate everything because he was hungry, he didn't particularly care for it.  I'm thinking that figures since the house specialty is the crawfish. But unfortunately, because these items are on the menu, they could use a bit more attention; hence, a four star rather than a five star rating.  The restaurant was clean and, importantly, so were the restrooms!  Now, if you're too prissy to eat with your hands and you have a problem with not using a plate, then this isn't the place for you, even though they give out nice bibs and you eat from a plastic table cover.  Keep in mind, you do eat from a plastic bag and you drink from styrofoam cups...okay so that's not environmentally friendly but who cares!?!  I even bought a tank shirt...and that's an unusual move for me.  I'm thinking I'll definitely be back...and next time, I'll try shop No. 1 to see if it's as good as shop No. 2."}
{"text":"Very Disappointed! So we came here for a family lunch, as our server Jacaqueline took our order she noted down what we wanted and when it got to our younger cousins order (he's 10) he got plain boiled shrimp and she pretty much demanded that he pick a spice, we have ordered plain boiled shrimp before we were confused on why she wasn't letting him get the plain shrimp, we orders appetizers and also 3 sides of rice, the food took over 30 mins to get to us, she told us after she brought the drinks that the rice would take about 20 mins to get to us, she didn't check on us ONCE, every time we needed her WE HAD to call her and literally raise our hands to get her attention, the restaurant wasn't even packed. When our food eventually got to us, my cousin was missing her order of sausage that's suppose to be mixed in and I was missing my potato, I called her over and she seemed confused she then came back with a pen and paper and made me repeat my correct order. We still hadn't gotten our rice by the time we were almost finished eating, so after we were pretty much done with our food she brought out the potato and sausage, still no rice so we just cancelled the order 3 orders of rice, we had two separate checks, she asked my bf to \"point\" out what we had ordered and what was going to be on the separate check. Overall we felt like we weren't really welcomed here; which is sad because we come here quite often. Probably won't be the case anymore"}
{"text":"JARED IS A GREAT SERVER. I usually eat at boiling crab but when I got here my server was amazing. He helped us and treated us good. MYKA THE SERVER/HOSTESS was bad. She was so rude. When we came she didn't smile it's like she hates her job. Then she kept seating people before us that also had a large party and we had a party of 6. We let it go for a couple of them but when she kept skipping us we asked her why and she got all offensive and gave us attitude. Such a rude girl. Other then that the food was on point. ?"}
{"text":"I've driven passed this building thousands of times. I never really noticed it, until I went to New Orleans, and fell in love with crawfish! Then I saw it featured by Adam Richmond, on Man VS Food! I've been wanting to try it, ever since.  Tonight, I was able to try it. I must say my favorite dish is Crawfish Étouffée! I was disappointed that they only offer it, as a side dish.  I had a pound of Crawfish, which was fresh, tasty, but very hard to eat! I found myself struggling to get some meat!   They serve it in a bag, with no utensils, so don't wear a long sleeve shirt, because it's messy. With that said, be prepared to freeze before getting your meal... I'm not sure why they run the AC so high, but once you dig in to your meal, it will warm you up.    I would suggest going in there with at least 3 people, and sharing. They offer more than crawfish. They have shrimp, lobster, oysters, and many forms of crab.  They need to clean the bathrooms more! My wife told me the Women's bathroom was a mess, and when I went into the men's room,  I had to stand way back, to not step in pee.  I look forward to going back. Although a few negative aspects of the place, the food is well priced, and delicious. It's the only place in town I've had fresh crawfish... So I have nothing to compare it to. I believe it's the only place in town that has crawfish flown in daily!"}
{"text":"3.5 was in vegas for the weekend, and a friend of mine came here before, and i wanted to try it...then i found out man vs. food was here to have the crawfish as well...so i was super excited! we came here around 6:30 on a sunday night...and the wait was about 30 minutes...ok not bad, well just have a couple beers while we wait.... then the girl come up to us as says...theyre all out of crawfish.  WHAT?!?!? this place says hot and juicy CRAWFISH in the name...hwo can you run out??? -1 ok...so we were debating whether or not to stay, but we did make the trip off the strip to come here (yes..we came a long way..haha) so we decided to stay. we ordered 2lbs of shrimp, and one dungeoness crab, fries, corn, susage....all hot and juicy special, spicy. i also wanted etouffee, but they ran out of that as well! UGH. so we settled for bowl of rice -_-  well when the food came, it was prety good and spicy. well let me tell you, normall yi would have gotten 2lbs of crawfish and 1lb of shrimp, and that would have been enough for 2 people, but since there were no crawfish, we ordered 2lbs of shrimp and one crab... 2lbs of shrimp..is TOO much for 2 people. 1lb would have been sufficient.  anyways, the foods was pretty tasty, but i cant help but compare it to boiling crab in california...which i love..and i think it tastes better...and they dont ever run out of crawfish... -.5   so...yea....thats about it."}
{"text":"Good restaurant if you are craving spicy seafood. First, do not wear nice clothes if you  are eating at Hot N Juicy. You are using your hands most of the time and the plastic bib can come of easily, so expect some splashed sauce on you clothing. I always go for their shrimp with Hot n Juicy sauce. The shrimps are fresh and huge. The sauce suites the the shrimp meat very well. I also love their seasoned fries.   The quality of the food and service is exactly same as the Henderson location, but this place is more busy sometimes. You should check it out."}
{"text":"Never did I think I would love a seafood place so much! My mouth is watering as I'm writing this review. I want more lol. The seafood of your choice, comes at you piping hot in a plastic bag ready to be torn apart and eaten! I make sure to get the white steamed rice and the Cajun fries to go along with my half a pound of shrimp! Them Cajun fries though, there crunchy, spicy, and full of flavor! The corn is super sweet and the potatoes are flavored in the sauce of your choice! Prices are definitely reasonable for all the food that you get!  *Make sure you wear them gloves and bibs!!! Things can get a little cray cray!   Service is always great!"}
{"text":"My cousin took me here when I was in town for a week and I was so excited! Coming from the Bay Area, we of course have Boiling Crab and Kickin' Crab (my fave) so I was excited to see a seafood place with such great reviews!  The server was excellent, very hospitable and accommodating to our group which included 2 toddlers and 1 infant. I so appreciate the fact that they give plastic gloves here so burning your hands is not an issue. I wish they did this in the Bay but I'll live ha.   The adults ordered a lb of the shrimp each with a side of the cajun fries and some regular fries for the kiddies (they had just eaten so it was enough for them lol).   Most of the shrimp were cooked pretty well, some were over-cooked but I still ate them because the seasoning was so good. The cajun fries, while delicious, were wayyy too spicy for me (Note: I'm such a baby when it comes to spices so while this may not be spicy to some, it was for me haha). Probably will stick to the regular fries.   But all in all, it was a great experience. Service was attentive and food was yummy, and the pricing was pretty affordable. Didn't hurt my wallet too much aha. A go to spot in Vegas for sure!"}
{"text":"So good.  In Vegas for 4 nights and ate there twice.  Shrimp, crawfish, crablegs, clams, order them all."}
{"text":"They're not kidding when they say it's spicy. Being Korean, my mom and sister decided to be brave and go for the spiciest crawfish, but my sister quickly regretted it and ordered a regular spiced one. Haha. Everything is full of flavor. I like the potatoes it comes with, too. Not being a fan of crawfish, I just got fish and fries. Obviously, I am not the right person to come here, but my family really enjoyed this place.   Tip: The food is very pungent and will seep into your clothes, and the whole eating process is super messy. I didn't even eat crawfish, but my mom was eating one and accidentally flung a piece to my ear! So, dress appropriately and prepare to get messy."}
{"text":"If your looking to dine carb friendly, Hot N Juicy is a good option. H&J is another Cajun food style restraunt. They are fairly new to the valley. My wife and I both enjoy seafood so we gave H&J a shot. She ordered the Shrimp H&J style with baby spice. As for me I had the Crawfish H&J style medium heat with sausage add-on. We also ordered the chicken wing appetizer. We had asked if the chicked wings were breaded and we're told no. When we recieved them they were breaded. We just pulled the breadding off and ate them. The wings were good and cooked throughout. I didnt like that they had no seasoning on them. My wifes shrimp came out and half were good the other half were mushy. (Sign of old or refrozen shrimp.) The staff was great about it and brought out another half pound that were good. The crawfish was good as well. Well seasoned and tasty. Beware of ordering the crafish though. You are going to put in some worj if you order these mud bugs because you have to peel the armor of a shell off of it. But the taste is worth it. We liked H&J but the price was a little steep for what we got. Not a bad place at all though. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I changed my crawfish order from extra spicy to just spicy. My face almost melted. It was frick'n good!! But a wee bit to hot and I like hot. I was sweating. The soft shell crab and Cajun sweet potato fries were very good too!"}
{"text":"Finally came and checked out the new location in Henderson... much larger then the other one in Vegas.  Friendly staff and food was just as good as i remember!  The Cajun fries are my absolute fav."}
{"text":"The Experience was definitely worth it.  the crawfish was incredible especially for us being first timers.  The lobster was juicy and full of succulent meat. Love the vibe of the restaurant and it was perfect for us to watch and enjoy the Vegas Hockey playoff game. Would definitely recommend it to shellfish lovers!"}
{"text":"I recently went on a date here, and the customer service was horrible, but the seafood was great so maybe it's a hit and miss"}
{"text":"food was great  service the worst i ever had  i had to chase the server for lemons he never comeback to refills our drinks i been a couple of time to this location and service was great maybe he is new with no experience on how to take care of costumers very unfriendly !!....don't tink i coming back!"}
{"text":"**Update 5/23** We went back only 6 days later and you can tell the world has gotten out about this new location. It was a lot of people, and we were quoted a 30 minute wait, but we were seated much sooner than that. All the servers were hustling to get people seated, fed, and tables cleaned. They were all still polite, even though it was clearly packed wall to wall. I forgot our waitresses name, but she was from the Vegas location and she was great. We saw our server Tiffany from last week and see remember us! Good service and good food!"}
{"text":"So I was at my GF's hotel room at TI, and we were laying down there watching TV relaxing and digesting all the junk and drinks we had the night before and during the day at the pool. We both took a nap and I turned on the TV. Then all sudden we realized MAN VS FOOD was being televised in Las Vegas. So it caught our attention. So being from Texas and having access to good NOLA type of food an cajun food. I was intrigued that this guy was at a local joint here off Spring Mountain Road ((KNOWN FOR ASIAN FOOD)) and thought to myself.. I gotta try that place out. So needless to say, we jumped in a taxi and headed over there. The minute you get there, your eyes start to water and you can smell the spice from 20 yard OUT from the front door. I knew at this point I was in love. Sorry sweetie, but there is room for more than one love in my life.. Its called food :) Though, we placed our name on the list and it took a while to sit us down. That was ok, I knew it would be a wait. Though, once we sat down and we ordered 2 pounds of crawfish and an order of king crab! We were in love! Some of the best food! I cant say it was the best Ive ever had, but might tasty and I filled my stomach up with anything I saw on the table. Its completely messy though. So expect to leave with the smell of spice and seafood on your body for the next couple of days. Also expect to be drenched in a goooy saucey spice sauce all over your fingers! The food was served in huge bags with the food in them. You rip them apart and lay it all out on the trash bag covered table. It was a bliss for me. Everyone was really friendly and I really really enjoyed the food adn my experience. It was very affordable and I would come back for sure! Not to mention the blonde new jersey girl told us a story that the guy from MAN VS FOOD, got drunk and passed out in the back of her car. Wonder what else happened :) hehe jk.. regardless, if you are in the Las Vegas area, and you want to get something away from the strip and enjoy a good meal. make your self available to this awesome lil hole in the wall. You will not be let down!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love a good creole broil, so when I saw this featured on Man vs Food I knew I had to come try this place out. I didn't realize that there were several stores in Vegas and even some in So. Cal. We got in just before the dinner rush so we waited about 5 minutes, but it even when we walked out it didn't seem like the wait time was too bad.   We has tried their Hot N Juicy seasoning (which was garlic butter, lemon pepper, cajun, and Louisana all together) and baby spice hotness level in shrimp and mussels because I don't like it too spicy, the baby spice was still a little spicier than I'd like but provided good flavor. With our broil we added corn, sausage, and red potatoes.  The flavors were very bold and strong. We ordered a side of sweet potato fries. To cap off the dinner, I had to try the fried brownies.  When it arrived it was warm and aromatic. The outside was a soft shell that wasn't too hard but provided great texture to the soft moist inside. We weren't able to finish it so we took it to go and after two days when we got home from our trip, we placed it in our air fryer to warm it up and it still tasted like it just came out of the restaurant kitchen. Everything was very tasty especially the fried brownies. We'll definitely be back and will be looking to try the locations closer to home.  Parking can be a bit tricky because it's a small lot for the amount of restaurants for this location, so parking can become very limited in front of the establishment."}
{"text":"Out of the 3 locations in Las Vegas, this is my favorite. I feel as if it is the cleanest with the friendliest staff. I also like that you dont leave the restaurant smelling like youve just eaten HnJ. The other location on Spring Mountain - if i eat there and leave to go meet my friends a couple hours later...they can tell what I had for lunch due to the smell seeping out my pores haha The bathroom is always clean as well with plenty of soap! After eating, I always have to go and wash my hands, and the soap always being there is a plus.  For the food,  The crab is usually on point for me. It is cooked all the way through. There was ONE time where my crab was still cold, but the waitress immediately apologized and made it on the house. I usually get the garlic butter flavor, because you can never go wrong with tons and tons of garlic!!! The hot n juicy flavor is good as well. I also sometimes vary with a pound of shrimp or a dozen oysters. The shrimp is pretty big, so if youre not that hungry, you should get half a pound. The oysters are always yummy and I have yet to get a scrawny puny one. Their cajun fries are also very delicious - crispy and ful of flavor. I have not eaten the crawfish, but I hear its good. I feel like its too much trouble to go through ALL THAT peeling for a tiny piece of meat.   You can always ask for lemons and limes with salt/pepper fo rmore flavoring or to wash your hands with after. I like to grab some lemon sliced and rub them all over my hands to take away the smell and dirtiness. You can also ask for bibs to avoid splatter damage.   All in all, I prefer this place over boiling crab even though some people claim they taste the same. I would definitely come pay this place a visit ."}
{"text":"love love love this place! time to get vegas dirrrty! suck, peel, and swallow some crawfish and shrimp! a must do! get the etouffee heaven :)"}
{"text":"We dropped in here last Saturday with high expectations after the rave reviews of friends. Being both big seafood fans and also believers in food-as-sport, we thought we'd found our restaurant utopia.  Boy, were we wrong.  The shrimp was bland, the sauce was not spicy, and the sides that we ordered never came. Either we came at an off time, or this place is WAAAAAAAAAY over-hyped."}
{"text":"I want to move to Vegas because of this restaurant! I saw this featured on Man VS Food and oh boy, I can sense the goodness emanating from the TV and I made my husband promised to take me there. So one weekend off we went to Vegas, not for the casinos or the shows but for Hot N Juicy and it was worth the 4 hour drive from Temecula! There was a short wait when we went there, we ordered shrimp and crab, sweet potato fried and corn. Me and my husband demolished every bit of the 2 lb shrimp and 1 lb crab. The sauce was delicious and I literally licked my fingers."}
{"text":"I agree with Marilou A. (the reviewer before me). Similar experience. I'm from S. Cali and love crawfish. We went to Hot & Juicy bc one of our friend saw it on Food Network. (*Side note: It was on \"Man vs Food\" and obviously the host has never been to Boiling Crab in S. Cali.)  Anyways, so when we went they told us they only had frozen crawfish. We figured we had frozen crawfish before ... if the sauce is good, everything will be ok. NOTHING WAS GOOD. 1) The crawfish was crumbly. I expected some toughness or flakiness from it being frozen, but this was just nasty. A bunch must have been dead before they were frozen.  2) The sauce was NOT JUICY. It did not make me want to lick my fingers or suck the crawfish head. Too salty and pungent. 3) The corn was either overcooked or it was bad frozen corn. The kernels were tiny and prune-like.   The only think I liked about the place was the fried chicken wings. Those were definitely HOT & JUICY, but I didn't go there for crawfish. I wanted dang good crawfish. We felt so cheated out  of the experience, so when we went home 2 days later, we dropped by Boiling Crab to cleanse our taste bud of not Hot & Juicy.   WILL NEVER COME BACK TO THIS PLACE AGAIN."}
{"text":"Place was crowded, which was a good thing, good for business, when we took our mom there for Mother's Day 2014.  The server was not very friendly but he took the time to explain how the ordering system works. They do not include the corn & Potato on the bag of Seafood unless it's a bag Crawfish. We had to pay extra for the potatoes & corn because we ordered the shrimp, clams and just one order of the Crawfish. We were not very impressed with the service but the food was good. This place will not my first choice of restaurants to re-visit."}
{"text":"Have been here  few times and have always loved it here!  The shrimp and the crab are my fav!  The wait staff has always been very friendly, although the most recent time i was there, they had already run out of a lot of menu items, and it was still very early in the night, which im not going to lie, of course upset me and made me highly consider going and trying out The Boiling crab... that review to come soon!  The space is very small, and you do feel like you are almost sitting ontop of the person besides you, and while eating food that tends to get very messy, thats not always a good feeling.  Over all, I have enjoyed my times here!"}
{"text":"Hey, this is a great place to get reasonably priced seafood.  Got the ettouffee and it was delicious.  Very spicy, lot of clams, and garlicky.  We also tried the snow crab legs, another winner!  This is a casual dining experience, you eat alot with your hands and it can get messy.  They even give you bibs to protect your clothing."}
{"text":"Arguable when comparing to Boiling Crab, but personally, I prefer BC.  HJ is certainly much more juicier and spicier and though I did not give anything else but shrimps a try, I was disappointed.  For one, once I peel off the shell of the shrimps, there is remaining meat that is the size of a fingernail. I like to eat big so that was disappointing. It was a lot spicier for I was struggling with my life to diffuse the spices in my mouth.  On the other hand, the fries were as good as you get anywhere else. Like I always say, if you mess up on fries, something is wrong with you.  In conclusion, I prefer Boiling Crab. It's just preferential that I like my shrimps larger. But I give HJ 3 stars because they do a good job in explaining their styles and overall good service. Nevertheless, I don't see myself coming back here for enjoyment purposes."}
{"text":"I just realized I haven't written a review for this establishment which is about five years late. Lol  Being from Hawaii, this is a stop we always make when in Vegas. We have a couple places similar on Oahu but it doesn't come close to HOT & JUICY CRAWFISH!  Anyway, what can I say about this place...only that it's complete heaven! Lol the best time to go is as soon as they open which is at 12 noon because you'll be waiting any other time of the day.  Your waiter/ waitress will set you up with a bib just so you don't get any of their sauce all over your clothes. Just an FYI...this is where you can get down and dirty...no need to worry about being proper...just use your hands, dig in and go for broke!  We always order the crawfish, shrimp, fresh oysters, and shrimp étouffée!  It's always so full of flavor and so satisfying. It might take a while to get your food but this is one place it's worth the wait!  I have no complaints with customer service....they were always there to check up on us and make sure we were okay!  I can't wait to go back!!! See you soon HOT & JUICY CRAWFISH!!! Maybe we'll go check out their new location near Chinatown!"}
{"text":"Love crawfish and the best part is, it's on the Strip!  So convenient and no need to go to China Town to get our crawfish fix lol"}
{"text":"Vegas's answer to Boiling Crab...only more low key  I love cajun seafood spots because they're so low maintenance.  I don't have to worry about using the right fork with the right dish.  Actually, I don't even need utensils.  Awesome!  This is precisely the reason I went here on a (hot)  Sunday afternoon with the boyfriend, hoping it would be a nice afternoon date spot.  I was right.  The place wasn't too packed, or noisy, and surprisingly, we were seated immediately.    In terms of the food, as many of the California kids on here had mentioned, the menu is a lot like Boiling Crab.  In lieu of the Whole Shabang, you can get the Hot n' Juicy special, which is a combination of different spices.  We got that Hot n' Juicy special seasoning with 2 lbs of crawfish, boiled shrimp, a basket of fried shrimp and fries, and an order of oysters.   If you order  a 2 lb bag, they throw in a whole potato and cob of corn, both of which taste delicious after having been marinating in that cajun seasoning.  We ordered everything as Medium spicy, which the waitress had warned us as being very hot for most people.  I didn't think it was unbearably spicy.  It was just right!  However, If you're sensitive to spicy foods, you might want to go down a notch.  Not to mention,  they also have a good selection of cheap beers to go with that Hot n' Juicy special.  Great local spot away from the craziness of the Las Vegas strip.  I'll be coming back!"}
{"text":"they told me the crawfish are live so i ordered a few lbs, turn out they were soft and soggy like they have been frozen for months! not to mention they put too much sauce in they bag to make it heavier or somethingfor the price that they charge for live crawfish im very disappointed"}
{"text":"My buddy dragged me here but I was not really looking forward to it. Boy was I glad he did! This place is amazing. Went here for lunch, a short cab ride from the strip over to Chinatown. Located in a strip mall it is very casual, but nice and clean. I ordered two pounds of snow crab and a pound of king crab in their Hot N Juicy hot sauce which is a combination of all their sauces mixed together and it was delicious. NOTE: you can order mild hot or extra hot, I am usually an extra hot kind of a guy(don't you agree? KIDDING!)) but the waitress warned me that there sauces  are very hot and customers always say the stuff is hotter that they expected. In fact it was true their medium is hotter than most places hot or even extra hot. it was not too hot for me but I was pleasantly suprised at the heat levels. We also ordered a few side dishes, frys and corn fritters. They also serve bottled beers which are a must in my opinion and I am not a big beer drinker but this food goes well with a beer or three LOL. Another note, it is kinda messy so don't wear white and wear the silly bib they give you.  I am looking forward to my next trip to vegas so I can go back and eat here again."}
{"text":"The wait was beyond ridiculous. When they took us back to be seated, the table was not ready! We were all served our food at different times.  Order was incorrect and when items were missing waitress entered order again, creating incorrect bill! Will never go back again!"}
{"text":"Growing up some of my good friends were Louisiana Creole, and every so often they'd fly in crawfish from Louisiana and cook it right there in their backyard. So I've been wanting to check out Hot N Juicy since I moved to Vegas, but I tend to think of it as a communal eating experience that requires at least a small group. I finally had my chance last weekend when my aunt and cousin came into town with their friends.   For 5 people (four women, one man) we ordered 3 lbs of crawfish, 4 lbs of shrimp, a dozen sausages, and one corn and potato for each person, all cooked in the Hot N Juicy house seasonings (as recommended by the waitress when we couldn't decide). The first time you go to a restaurant like this it is hard to know what spice level to choose. We had a mixed group so we played it safe by getting everything mild and asking for a medium sauce on the side. I can handle spicy pretty well, and I think the mild was perfect if you just want to enjoy the flavor of the food with a small amount of kick for the authentic Cajun taste. Granted, the shrimp hold the spice much better than the crawfish (since you get such a small amount of meat out of crawfish). I think that if I came here with just my husband, we'd probably opt for medium level spice since he puts hot sauce or salsa on everything!!  Know before you go: There are no plates. You are served all your food in plastic bags (to hold in the juices) right on your table which is covered with paper and supplied with plastic gloves and a roll of napkins. You are also given a bib to wear, and you'll need it!!! It is a messy and time consuming meal (for the infrequent crawfish eater) but once you get over getting \"down and dirty\" at dinner, it is well worth it!!"}
{"text":"Food was really good! Piping hot, flavorful. Wish I'd ordered sausage, a few corn and a few potatoes in my bag. The spice is spicy, dial it down a few from your level. Ordered beer, luke warm, waitress battled an attitude when we told her. Service was okay, need to step it up a little. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and I've never had a bad experience.  I love coming here and getting two pounds of shrimp.  I get 1 hot and 1 extra spicy.  This food is so good and you can add sausage and corn too.    If you like peel and eat shrimp then this place is a must.  It's priced well too"}
{"text":"Loved the hot and juicy sauce. Hated the Louisiana sauce, basically had no flavor. Don't get the crawfish when the waitress warns you that they are small and soft shelled.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying this review has nothing to do with the food. It is delicious and I alway enjoy it. This is about the atrocious service that I have gotten there almost every single time I've eaten there whether it is busy or not. It is like the servers are not even remotely trained on how to work in a a restaraunt. Food comes out in stages, side orders are either forgotten or brought out whenever they feel like getting aroud to it or just as you are finishing. Forget getting a drink refilled even once during the meal unless you ask repeatedly. The server who takes your order pretty much vanishes after that. My last visit the bill came to 75.00 dollars and I would have gotten better service at the McDonalds drive thru. I eat out a lot and have never seen service this poor. This place should close and have it's staff properly trained before re-opening."}
{"text":"The Sauce!  must get the hot and juicy sauce!  we had the clams, fried shrimp and crab boil. This place is awesome!  not cheap but the quality is there.  we easily spent $100 for lunch...but soooo delicious!"}
{"text":"Skip this place, went there with a group of 4 before the Madonna concert....Waited an hour, and our food started coming to the table in the most unusual order...one person got a potato, one person got their shrimp without the fries. One person didn't get their dinner at all...the food was so so, not bad, not good."}
{"text":"Need a spicy kick to get over your hangover? well this is the place! outta all of the Cajun southern places, i think this is my fav. Right when I walked into the restaurant, the aroma of homey seafood spices lingers right into my nostrils like music to my ears.  Got seated, ordered the usual craw fish, shrimp, and sweet potato fries but the thing that i really enjoyed was the deep fried catfish with fries, it was mm mmm good salty and crispy with fish meat in the middle. Towards the end of the gruesome shell tearing lies the shrimp and crawfish graveyard on the table. i poured some corona (in my mouth) for the sea critter homies, RIP delicious bunch :)"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. I asked the waitress if I could have a refill on my soda and she just walked away from me . Very expensive for very little food . Had to grab some McDonald's after we left . Smh  no plates , no forks, spoons, etc"}
{"text":"Love this place! People have different taste buds but in my opinion and my husbands, this place is better than boiling crab. Reason being:  Less wait time now that there are 2 locations near each other. yay!  Service: funner happier servers compared to boiling crab.  Cost: a little costly but its seafood, its fresh and so far nowhere else like it. No, not boiling crab either.  Taste: More flavorful spices yet less greasy and heavy compared to boiling crab. That is good enough and convincing to me. I mean come on people, its not featured on Man vs Food on the Food Network for nothing you know."}
{"text":"This place is yummy !! I enjoy seafood a great deal, so this is a great place to get some.  I will say that it can get a lil messy here, so you do not need to be rocking your couture ! lol"}
{"text":"I loooove this place. Their service has been awesome every time I've been in. All the servers seem to help each other out if things get busy so you always get what you need ASAP. And they're all very personable and treat you like family. Management is top notch and super quick to fix any problems. Very professional and not to mention everyone who works there is freakin gorgeous? What is that about. Idk but I am not complaining. But anyways, most importantly: THE FOOD. I am all about seafood so I frick frackin love it. Super messy but you can always ask for gloves and ladies BRING A HAIR TIE. You get to choose the flavor and level of spice. (Lemon pepper baby spice is my personal fav cuz I'm a wimp) the food is delicious and it's a fun experience to eat it Louisiana style out of a bucket. Would recommend to any fellow southerners who are visiting Arizona and to any Arizonans who are looking to try something new."}
{"text":"The best thing about this place is the service,  always fast and friendly.  Oysters were warm and we had to send then back,  ordered a pound of crab legs and got one crab leg.  Yes the manager fixed it but come on you sell food by 20 bucks a pound you'd better be weighing it.  The shrimp were  great in the house sauce and when we finally got a pound of king crab it was good.  Very few choices on hard alcohol,  1 Bourbon, I label of wine."}
{"text":"If negative Stars was an option that would be my choice. Drinks were late, not only once but twice. Server was not focused and didn't explain the menu even though we had asked about a specific item being split. When the bill came there was an issue, when asked about the price the waitress got extremely rude she wasn't very understanding. She insisted that we refer to the menu and the fine print which evidently did not support her claim. A manager was brought in on the situation who as well was very rude. Mind you this is the only table that ordered a lobster that was almost $45 by itself. Instead of Simply fixing the issue she started making remarks and arguing with us which soon turned into her calling security and the police who then forced us to pay the $91 bill. The hole serving crew needs to be completely replaced or we trained by someone who was more fit to be in a manager's position."}
{"text":"Thank you Man Vs. Food for reviewing this place! Fricken amazing! Simple and delicious, busy, but quick, the simplicity is what I love about this place; Seafood + Sauce + Bag + vigorous shaking = HOT N JUICY!  When you go I would suggest a pound of the king crab in pepper lemon sauce not spicy and a pound of crawfish SPICY! You will not be disappointed!  ENJOY!"}
{"text":"Hot and juicy has always been my fave go to spot for crab legs. I absolutely love their hot and juicy seasonings in baby spice. I'm excited about this new location bc it is closer to my home and I will be visiting at least once a week."}
{"text":"We come here every time we go to Vegas. Who wouldn't love donning a bib as an excuse to be as messy as a baby? After securing your bib you put on your plastic gloves and boom you're ready to demolish some sea creatures for an hour or two!  The food comes out happily swimming in one of their five house sauces, and you order by the pound. Plop! See through plastic bags of shrimp, mussels, crawfish, lobster, will be thrown on the table and your mission begins. It's an exported Louisiana style dining experience! I recommend getting the Hot n Juicy sauce, at mild spiciness. It's by far the tastiest and their mild spicy level has a deceivingly strong kick. This is for garlic lovers only, and is not a low sodium meal!  This year the crawfish were smaller and out of season, so they were made from frozen and not as fresh. The shrimp were large and excellent as always, and served with the head on. Mmm, brains. For mussels order the green mussels over the black, they will be larger and more flavorful.   Great for groups and sharing, but also fun for a date with some hands on eating!"}
{"text":"I wish I can say hot and juicy is better than boiling crab but it's always a comparing and contrast with me LOL well boiling crab has better oysters for a FACT. But I have to say the clams and crawfish are way better here! And the sauce here is a little more saucy and tasty. Oh and the fries here are pretty bomb. Customer service is good, somewhat fast. The place is kinda dark tho and not as big and spacious as boiling crab. I'd want to say id come back but boiling crab is too good (except for the whole waiting like 30 mins to be seated every time) or maybe I will come back for their clams when boiling crab is busy who knows :p"}
{"text":"Get ready to get dirty.  Oh yeah, don't be wearing white. Be comfy, cuz u gonna use your hands!  Fun place to try. Wish we had a place like this in Hawaii.   Food Ordered: -2 lbs of the crawfish. The hot n juicy special flavor with the extra spicy level. (of course) -fingerlickin good, tear ducts watering, nose running....yumminess. -Softshell crab (comes with fries) - good -4 corn - same ole, same ole  Environment Fairly clean. Wooden tables, some booths, casual.  Service Decent. Waitress was okay, a little ditzy, but okay.   Tip When u get there, the person taking your name down for the waitlist may say, \"go to the other NEW location down the block, there is no wait.\" WRONG, do not listen. We were smart enough to put our name on the list then check out the \"new\" location....yup, even looongger wait!  Lame. So we went back to the original location and waited just 15 minutes! Not much parking, so CARPOOL or go early!"}
{"text":"Man, what a delicious menu! The entire experience was great. Multiple servers, and the sweet asst manager, checked on us. My drink never went empty. Nice to be spoiled by the staff!  I highly recommend making friends with your server. They recommended the freshest catch, good deals and sauce/spice combos that were to die for. I ate 1 lb of lemon pepper shrimp and 2 lbs of the very reasonably prized crawfish. Delicious!!!!  Fun, messy, delicious. You can't go wrong at Hot N' Juicy. Great service, great prices, epic seafood. Don't second guess yourself, Do It!   ...Now to figure out the special sauce recipe..."}
{"text":"Maybe I never come when it's packed but people in LV are sleeping on this place.  Foreal tho.  Although I always seem to get a weird feeling in my head everytime I eat here, I always come back.  Flavor, flavor, flavor!! It's so strong and tasty!  I always get 1lb of shrimp, corn on the cob, half dozen sausage, and maybe a couple potatoe's all in one flavorful juicy bag. And a side order of rice... Or two.  Service is ALRIGHT, they're not on top of their game as opposed to the Boiling Crab in Alhambra, CA.  Beware!! After eating here, your hands, breath and clothes will smell like hot n juicy garlic for days!!  I suggest you ask for gloves and wear clothes you don't wanna wear out that night as it will begin to be smelling like your aunties house who cooks all the time. As for the breath, there's no escaping that.  Don't wear a white shirt either, guaranteed there's gonna be shrimp and crawfish brains splashing everywhere.  The bib they give you is essential."}
{"text":"F this place.  Worst service ever.  I sat and waited a century to be asked for my drink.  I said I am ready to order.  I put in the order with the horrible waitress and asked for some sauce on the side.  I wait another century...kids graduated, married, and having their own grandkids later and my food comes out.  It's missing what I asked for.  Waitress runs away like a thief in the night before I can tell her.  I wait another ice age and she comes back.  I say you forgot my shit.  She leaves again. Jesus comes back to judge us and she returns.  She forgot it again.  She says \"well you are almost done do you still want it.\"  Yes B, I want it!  She never comes back.  Neither do I.  Come here if you have eons of time to waste and want shitty service.  I'm out."}
{"text":"Shrimp and crawfish are the most fave here! Always very tasty with the cajun flavor. Even with garlic butter seasoning, you cant really go wrong with. Very casual atmosphere, friendly staff. We're regulars."}
{"text":"This was one of my favorite places to eat, but not any longer. I have had okay customer service, bad customer service, and now beyond bad customer service . I tried to not focus so much on the workers attitude since I loved the food, but now I have had it. I order a pick up order, but soon my friends and I decided we rather just eat in. The restaurant was full in doors and would've been a 30min wait. The front cashier girl said we were welcome to sit outside mind you no one was sitting outside on this hot day. We agreed to sit outside . As we began to eat one of the workers comes outside and tells us we can't eat out there . We ask why if the girl inside had said we could and he said it wasn't fair for the other people waiting . The problem was there was 7 tables outside and all were empty. He had a very aggressive attitude and was extremely rude . We asked to speak to someone else. When the next girl came she didn't even bother to listen to the situation she just snapped her fingers and said to leave. She called security on us for no good reason after they had originally told us we could eat outside . Overall, they don't care for their customer whatsoever. I hate this place now."}
{"text":"I visited the Vegas location.  1. Ordered shrimp- large, fresh  and decent flavor profile.  2. Poor service and it was not crowded.  3. Soft shell crab had a weird canned,chicken grease type of flavor. Gross   For me it was a miss! Vegas has too many amazing eats for me to revisit here.   The end"}
{"text":"Such horrible service . I went in with my son that's 1 and a half. I told the waitress to send his fries out first because my baby was fussy and hungry. I ordered pound of shrimp and a corn on the cob with a side of red potato. Well my potato came first with the corn was really cold temperature, I sent it back and asked for a new one. Well my sons fries never came and I had to keep on asking for them. My potato finally came with my corn when I was done peeling and eating my shrimp. My napkins were out had to ask to get them replaced. Also my drink was never refilled till the end. Never got an apology for their lack in service. Never will come to this location. Your employees need training.   The manager contacted me and offered me a free brownie dessert!!!!!! Really!!!!!!! WOW!!! That's not going to solve all the issues I had with the restaurant!!"}
{"text":"The food is soo good!!! And the service is great! Especially when you have Leila as ur waitress! She's so cute and charming! I'll be back soon!(X"}
{"text":"Oh, the very moment I stepped into Hot N Juicy Crawfish I knew I'd love it.  I sat down, looked at my foodie friend and said, \"I know I haven't eaten anything yet, but can we come back soon?\" Lol.  The smell of the garlic fills the small restaurant, and the smiles upon everyone's face makes you want to smile along with them.  I go to lunch every Saturday at 2:00 pm, and most places are dead, but this place was packed, with movement and chatter...it really has an incredible vibe!  The service was great for how busy it was and the wait staff was all friendly, our waitress explained the menu to us and also answered our questions thoroughly ( I was REALLY hoping the pictures on the walls were because of some type of eating contest, but...it was just pictures of customers..drat)  We ordered 1 lb of crawfish, Hot N Juicy Special flavor, medium.  I didn't think it was TOO spicy, but I'm not sure If I'd go up a notch on spiciness, because I'm a wuss.  We also ordered the calamari and Cajun fries.  The crawfish were AMAZING. I've never had crawfish before, so I honestly can't compare it to others, but it was down-right delish in my book.  I got a kick out of my friend squirting himself in the face with crawfish juice, and wish I went with a group of friends, as most of the people there did. I would order the crawfish again in a heart beat! But I would get 1 lb to myself instead of sharing, because it was sooo nummy! Next time I'm probably going to try the King Crab legs, oooh yess.  The Calamari seemed really good at first, but the more I ate it the more salty it seemed to be...I probably wouldn't order them again because there are so many more appetizers to try! Next time I will probably try the fried catfish!  The cajun fries weren't my cup of tea, a little too spicy for poor little me.  My dear friend grubbed on them though, said he really liked em.  It was a lot of fun getting down and dirtay, and working for my food. And honestly, I would TOTALLY recommend eating here as a first date, whats a better way to get to know someone then being knee deep in delicious crawfish?"}
{"text":"I love this place! Whenever I'm craving seafood this is my go-to place. We usually start off with oysters, I forgot to ask what kind of oysters they were but they usually come pretty quick and they were good, fresh, cleaned well, and a good size.  And sometimes we get the Cajun fries but they can be a little too spicy. The sweet potato fries are really good though.  Then the rest of the food.. I like to order one pound snow crabs and a half pound of shrimp in hot n juicy medium sauce for myself. Some people like to do family style but it's easier ordering a bag of food per person and everyone can get their own. I also get a half dozen sausages in hot n juicy medium sauce in a separate cup. And a bowl of rice.  They say the sauce is one level spicier than it says, so medium is hot and hot is really hot. They also offer no spice to people that don't like anything spicy since their mild can sometimes be a little spicy. Since they make their sauce fresh the spice level can vary.   Their sauce is very flavorful and not watered down. I've been to places where their sauce mainly tasted like Old Bay seasoning or it was too watery that it didn't stick to the seafood when you dipped it in the sauce after peeling but HnJ's is on point.  I love that they give you bibs and they also offer gloves too. I'm a girl with nails so wearing gloves helps with not getting all the gunk from the sauce stuck under them lol. Either way you'll smell like garlic after leaving here but the food is so worth it!"}
{"text":"They're still number one in my book after how many long years since I've been flying up to vegas and this has always been a mandatory stop . Their sauce is unbeat! Best in flavor! So garlicky and so full of umami , it's crack !!! Seafood wise most times it's top notch but can be off during non season for crawfish ."}
{"text":"When in vegas we always have to have our hot n juicy , everything was delicious as always ,but like other helper have said, their spice level compared to most places are a bit hotter. So go with no spice if u usually get mild, I got mild and it was more like a medium for me.  Besides that it was a good experience , really wanted to take some of their sauce home back to hawaii but too lazy so I guess I just have to fly up again when I crave it lol excuse to go on a food trip"}
{"text":"Very good steamed seafood. You order buy the pound so yes it may seem expensive for food that comes in a plastic bag. However, it is done well, the food is fresh and they have a good selection. Remember that some seafood is seasonal so they may not have everything on the menu year round. My only complaint is that if you order an appetizer it usually comes out at the end of the meal, we've been twice and this happened both times. Not sure why, as they refill drinks quickly and overall service is good, I think the fried foods take a back seat to the steamed foods. Modest beer selection, but they have sweet tea so that wins them an extra star rating."}
{"text":"OMG! Absolutely the highlite of our short getaway to LV. Thank God for Man v Food for intro'g this place.  Lets see, started with oysters on half shell, 2 lb crawfish, fried calamari, 1 lb shrimp, the the King Crab Legs for dessert! We were pretty full then decided we had to try the crab legs and MAN AM I GLAD WE DID!   You soak those crab leg meat in their spicy sauce and you are as close to orgasm without stimulation as humanly possible! I think my wife had that \"Sleepless in Seattle\" moment ala Meg Ryan! haha priceless!  Not only was the food THE BEST, but the Staff was just outstanding. They helped us decide what to order and were very attentive without being intrusive. Outstanding!  Unless you like it really spicy, just order Mild, cuz that is spicy enough...Trust, we're asians and like our spices, but mild was plenty spicy for us!  Just another \"must visit\" place everytime we hit Vegas."}
{"text":"This was my first time at this location and I was impressed. I tried the shrimp and green mussels. Got them medium spicy. Both were great and I really liked the seasoning. Also tried the calamari appetizer, kinda bland, will try the Cajun calamari next time. Oysters were good too, more expensive than other places though.  The only draw back is that it's really messy. Make sure you wear the bib. The waitstaff is very friendly and helpful describing the menu items. They check on you a few times during the meal  I will definitely come back and try some of the other shellfish."}
{"text":"This is THE BEST & Freshest seafood in Chinatown it's just amazing my husband and I have to stop in every time we are in town! Please go to this one and not the 3863 one this is the true original and customer service is 10X better! SHOUT OUT TO MEGAN!!!! She was our server and was on top of everything! I will return to this location and this location only because of the impeccable customer service ;) THANKS AGAIN MEGAN! Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"I've been to Hot N Juicy for the past 4 years as a regular customer. It's become a tradition for my family and friends. I've always had a great experience there as well as great food. The employees are friendly and fun. They provide exceptional food and are extremely clean. I've never had any issues with their food or cleanliness.  Try the nosebleed sauce if you like spiciness. It's not on the menu.  My favorite is lemon pepper.  Get 2lbs and you get a free potato and corn =]"}
{"text":"Amazingly friendly service! Delicious food for a good price! Definitely coming again soon!"}
{"text":"OH VEGAS!  Hot & Juicy Crawfish is by far the BEST Crawfish joint I've ever been to. I live in San Jose, and there is no place that compares to this.  Crawfish, muscles, crab, and shrimp all blasted with flavor. This is a place I always have to stop by every time I'm in Vegas. Fast, Fantastic service, and a friendly staff.   BOMB.COM  Everyone must try this place, this place will not disappoint you."}
{"text":"Busy for a Wednesday night at 9pm. Tonight we ordered shrimp, crab, clams, and mussels a pound of each. Normally the shrimp is the first to come out but we ended waiting just about 30 minutes for my husbands shrimp, while everything else was brought to our table in a matter of 10 minutes; due to the fact I seen one of the servers bring our order of shrimp to a different table and when she was told it was the wrong order, instead of asking the other servers if another table ordered it she just brought it back to the kitchen.  Asked a server about it and she said she would check on it. She came back to refill our drinks and again said she would check on it, asked another server about it and our order was finally done. My husband and I are too polite to complain, because at the end are bellies are still satisfied ;)"}
{"text":"Food is delish, but BE WARNED! The service is HORRIBLE here. Every time I've come the waiter has been inattentive, I desperately die of thirst. My cup is literally never refilled.   The last time I came here my friend politely asked a waiter to leave a pitcher of water at our table since no one had come by to refill our cups since we sat down, the waiter politely said no, that he'd come back around and refill our cups (knowing our cups were empty) he didn't come back around to our table until 20 minutes later to refill. My friend had to get up and take a pitcher that was set down at a table near us (by a different waiter distracted - talking to a group of customers at another table) & LITERALLY refill her own cup of water. Today, we decided to place a TO-GO order with Hot N Juicy, trying to avoid nonsense with the senseless waiters. We called about 5:45 pm & were advised that our order would take about 30 minutes to make. When we arrived around 6:20 pm our order was still not ready. We did not receive our order until around 6:58 pm. Over an hour to make our food. The manager did give my friend a $30 compensation for next visit,  but they forgot to give us an order of sausage w/ 2 potatoes. & the food was all cold. Not going to go back again!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, but our server was terrible. Checked on us once, and flew our change on the table in a rude fashion. He probably was thinking that he was gonna get change for a tip. I was gonna leave him a good tip, but changed my mind after that. Everyone else that worked there was friendly however. Just our luck to get a bad server."}
{"text":"Excellent manager (Noemi) in your Glendale Az location. My family and I decided to go eat at Hot and Juicy Crawfish for a birthday as this was the 3rd time in one month, but had some issues with food, service and drinks. Noemi the manager in charge that night went above and beyond and really took care of us. She is a great person inside and out and really engaged when needed. Prior to Noemi taking charge, we were ready to get up and leave without ever returning. The actions the manager Noemi took and prompt service, we have now decided that we will continue to come back and enjoy Hot and juicy."}
{"text":"This place was awful.  I almost gave two stars because my husbands lobster was good, being from Maine it was not great, but he said it was good.  The reason I could not bring myself to give two stars is because my chicken was served undercooked, which could kill someone.  I understand this is a seafood establishment and chicken is not their specialty, but serving raw chicken is unforgivable.  Do not go here."}
{"text":"It was my friends birthday and we got horrible service they forgot our food THREE TIMES. Nikki was rude and unhelpful so was the other blonde woman. Not only did our food get forgotten we were treated like shit I recommend a different location or the boiling crab !!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that the food was great, and with a name like HJ's I thought I was in for a good time. Unfortunately this review is going to burn a bit more than the \"extra hot\" n spicy seasoning.  When we first arrived we were given a wait time of 10 minutes. Cool. We stood and waited for 15 minutes...then I was able to check a month's worth of emails, check all social networking sites, and watch 3 other groups that arrived before us still waiting. 35 minutes later the host says \"I'm sorry I worked at the Vegas location and didn't know how their wait times worked here.\" Oh thank you for telling us you had no idea what you're doing sir.  Apparently a party of 30 people decided to stick around doing absolutely nothing but talk and let their kids run around like pint sized tyrants having sword fights with crab crackers. I was in the sandbox corner it was a nightmare. Granted this is not their fault, but it wasn't helping. Our server was quick to greet us and take our order.   Ok, good. Things are getting better. 20 minutes pass and my boyfriend receives his bag of food. Our server quickly scuttled away like the crab legs I still hadn't received. I asked when the rest of the food will be out and he said \"I'm sorry man the kitchen is really backed up right now.\"  *scuttles away* Why the hell would you serve half of a tables food? I now had the pleasure of watching my boyfriend eat his crawfish for 15 minutes until I received my food.... And we were still missing our sides...10 minutes pass and I ask about them. The server acts as if he had no idea what I was talking about and scuttled back to grab our fries.  So for a grand total of 1 1/2 hours we finally BOTH had our food. It was great, but we won't ever be coming back. Every person who works here is just as baked and clueless as the bags of crawfish they're serving.  (Also noticed another girl mentioned this in her review, but they randomly decided to wheel a giant trash bin throughout the floor instead of taking it out back. Nothing better than looking at 30 pounds of half eaten food while eating.)"}
{"text":"Meh, I'm an avid Hot & Juicy lover so I tolerate this location when visiting family. My love for Hot & Juicy started in Las Vegas and then I found gold when they opened a location in Tempe. This location in Glendale has good service but consistently makes the sauces much differently than the one in tempe & vegas if you've tried it. Today I had 2 pounds of lemon pepper snow crab legs ( medium ) and the sauce has twice a much grease as it normally has, to the point you have to vigorously stir to get any hints of lemon pepper. I've tried this location so many times and it continues to be off. We also had fried shrimp that were AMAZING, we tried the pork skins and they were okay. Our server spilled our water while delivering our order but did offer to purchase as a beverage for the inconvenience. I love hot and juicy and I wish this location would get the sauces right!"}
{"text":"We always stop here when we come to Vegas. Staff is always friendly and attentive. Food is always good. My favorite is the shrimp in hot n juicy spicy flavor , add corn and sausage for even more fulfilling tastes. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I could probably eat 3 or 4 pounds of seafood here.  The seasonings are great and the seafood is pretty fresh. Prices are affordable. You won't catch me wearing a bib though."}
{"text":"Cajun seafood at its best.  I recommend the snow crab legs and shrimp ($10/lb).  The crawfish ($11/lb) was tasty, but it's so much work to get to the small pieces of meat. We ordered everything in medium, but even that was pretty spicy!  I can't imagine what extra spicy tastes like.  Your bowels would probably be in butt-clenching agony."}
{"text":"got crawfish with the hot n juicy special seasoning at spice level medium...the crawfish soak up the flavor well but have little meat on them....my brother got shrimp which do not hold the seasoning as well....my buddy got snowcrab and wouldnt let me try it but said it was great....they bring it out in a plastic bag and you peel and eat with your hands...i had a small cut on my hand and couldnt sleep that night cuz it was burning/throbbing from the second lowest spice level"}
{"text":"I have been to Hot n Juicy a few times, even at the first location. I would do 3 1/2 stars if I could.   I was at the pool, met some people visiting, they said they were going here and invited us. Sure, why not. Ubered over here. They said they don't have Hot N Juicy where they live so they make it a point to come here. Hot n Juicy should feel flattered.   We arrived late to the party, bags on the table and gloves already on everyone. We ordered catfish for us. It never came and a server told us it wasn't even ordered. Too bad they don't have a alcohol options, only beer. We were really looking forward to another drink. We were really looking forward to another drink right from the strip.   We also had a vegan at the table. Unfortunately, she had nothing to eat besides corn and fries.   I enjoyed the individual personalities. Water got on a phone and he brought us rice in a bag to get the water out. That was very nice.   I think Hot n Juicy is a very unique experience for visitors and locals and the restaurant should acknowledge the guests feel that way and live up to it."}
{"text":"So I had my birthday dinner here with my friends and I have to say it was a freaking experience that was amazing. I cannot wait to go back. I was a little disappointed that the spiciest sauce was not as spicy as I wanted, Next time I go I'll have to see if  they can kick it up a notch. Also its good to have rice on the side to suck up all the tasty juices."}
{"text":"I really like Hot and Juicy. It's delicious, requires about a million napkins, hands on eating. Great to mow down, drink a couple beers and enjoy potato and corn dipped in the crawfish juice glory."}
{"text":"Where do I start with this place?  I haven't found a single place that even begins to compare to the awesome seasoning this place uses.  It is hot and juicy, as the restaurant name suggests, and damn delicious.   The servers all bear a striking resemblance to Suicide Girls except without the attitude problem. I wish I remembered our girl's name, as she was super friendly and helpful, and even put on some gloves and demonstrated how to most efficiently peel our crawfish for the newbs at the table.  Ordered the crawfish, shrimp, and sausage (which should definitely be combined!) all in the special Hot and Juicy seasoning, medium level, which combines all of their flavors and was amazing. We also went through a basket of crispy cajun fries and added on some crab legs, but I don't remember what kind.  As with most restaurants that serve by the pound, this place can get pricey if you're not careful, but it is so tasty you'll pull out your wallet without a second thought."}
{"text":"If crawfish is what ur looking for in Las Vegas, then this is ur only real option. Sauce is amazing and customizable. Seafood quality ranks well with price. Service is usually pretty good.  Don't plan on going anywhere afterwards  because u won't smell right. A must go in Vegas. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Their food is so good I'm going back to eat once a month I highly recommend . Their food is way better than boiling crab."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a lunch of the Lemon Pepper Mild spice. I would recommend a little more spice but the food was amazing. The service was just as good. Our server was helpful and very knowledgeable. The HotnJuicy corn was good. Nice flavor and good size."}
{"text":"When was my last review of this place? 3/7/2008?!?! uh...wow...  Despite the long...LONG delay in returning there's one thing about hot and juicy i will never forget since the first time my brother took me there. START WITH MILD!!! I still remember the flash genocide of thousands of my taste buds when i took that first bite.  Service was great. Our server started off by informing us that because it's near the end of the mud bug's cycle the average size of the crawfish were smaller then usual. This saved a lot of grief and looks of WTH?! when the bags came. A majority of us where fine with the shrimp.  All and all an excellent night filled with laughter being exchanged between friends, shrimp and crawfish shells all over the table and everyone's garlic breath in the air.  Unless Hot N Juicy finds a way to breed and farm crawfish to provide large mud bugs year long there's no way this place can improve on what it's already got going.  Additional note it's every entertaining seeing female diners wearing stylish 'going out' clothes and that plastic bib with large lobster squeezing a lemon trying to save them a dry cleaning bill. LoL"}
{"text":"I've been here once and haven't been since. It's a fun place to hang out with friends, have a beer, and get your hands messy. The wait to get a table is way too long. The food was ok but not great. I think its more of the atmosphere that I enjoy."}
{"text":"Their MILD is NOT mild. Super spicy, my husband and I were not happy. If u have food that is crazy spicy, u should not call it mild. I think hotter than that our tongues would've melted. Not going back."}
{"text":"I LOVE hot&juicy. I ate there 1 or 2 times a week. I like crawfish,shrimp and snow crab legs in hot&juicy extra spicy sauce  and the servers are really nice and friendly especially her name is Lemonade she very helpful good take care and make sure we doing ok or if we need anything she will be right there. I love this place number one in my mine for my happy meal"}
{"text":"First of all I went to Vegas on a diet... (SO WHAT I CHEATED!) but it was worth the calories. And out of all the expensively ridiculously priced restaurants on The Las Vegas Strip this was the most economical (its worth a car rental/ limo drive). This place came highly recommended from Travel Channel's Man vs Food.  Ordering from menu was easy and simple. You have to definitely try my fave lemon pepper shrimp! But the crawfish, humugous king crab legs, and oysters are just as good too. It's Vegas's cheapest bag of freshest seafood and the best bang for your buck. EXTREMELY the highlight of my Las Vegas trip (off the strip)!  Employees were chill and friendly, don't be afraid to take apart anything with your hands. Great service! Too bad Hot N Juicy Crawfish isn't closer to my home town... tried a few Hot N Juicy knock-offs near home (but didn't even the close)"}
{"text":"Great value! Dinner for 5 with tip, $120. 3 orders of 1 pound shrimp, 1 pound of crawfish, 1 pound of mussels, 1 pounds of king crab legs, calamari, sweet potato fries and all of us got a soda. Food was flavorful, messy and fun! Chicago definitely needs a place like that. When you see market price on the menu, you think it's going to be really expensive, it wasn't at all. What a pleasant surprise. Fast service, yes there was a 20 minute wait to get a table after 9pm, but it was well worth it."}
{"text":"eh ... in my honest opinion boiling crab is wayyyyy better. there's just something not right about their sauce here."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Hot N Juicy from the time I walked in to til the time I left. My server was Cute N Friendly! She knew who she was dealing with because she recommended the Garlic Butter snow crab legs!  Whoooooooo!  The sauce was soooo good and spicy! So hot and tasty! I think I opened up other senses while on that food high! LOL!!! If you're a seafoodie, This is a MUST TRY! Highly recommended, prices are very reasonable. Email me and I will meet you there!"}
{"text":"Ambiance: 3. Don't set the bar too high -- H 'n J is a dive restaurant just off the Las Vegas strip in Chinatown.  That said, the exposed brick, checked table clothes and local feel makes it a treat.  Cost: 5. For once, we can all beat Vegas.  Even with a sub-$10 cab fare from the strip, H 'n J is still very affordable for what you get.  A pound each of crawfish, shrimp, and kind crab with sides and drinks did not top $60 with tip.  Meal would cost at least 2x that at the casinos, I almost don't want to share the secret for fear they jack the prices.  Food Quality: 4. H 'n J serves its seafood in plastic bags they've mixed the seasonings in.  No plates, no rules -- it gets messy.  But it's so good, you don't care.  It was my first shelled crawfish experience -- quite tender, but a lot of work to open up their apparently smaller than average crawfishes.  Shrimp were good, king crab legs were AWESOME.  Lemon pepper and Hot 'n Juicy special seasoning were probably the two best choices to go with -- for heat lovers, go with at least medium spice for flavors.  Service: 5. Waitress great, she walked us through the crawfish de-shelling process on arrival, as well as several menu questions on what to order, how much of it, and seasoning flavors.  When to return: When you need to get off the Strip and the f out of dodge, a cheap but great seafood meal, when you're not looking to get lucky in the following 6 hours."}
{"text":"It was my first time being at  hot and juicy crawfish.  overall experience was probably the best I have ever had at a restaurant in a long time. The customer service was above and beyond. I had three young ladies that were helping me by the name of Ashley, Nikki and Jasmine. I dinned in alone so it was nice having the girls chit chat with me, to keep me company. Especially when I had a gentleman bothering me to try and eat with him. They noticed it was bothering me and kept me company. The food was amazing, and they were so  patient and so polite to show me the proper way to eat crawfish!! I highly recommend this restaurant if possible to have one of the three girls to assist!!!! Loved the food but loved the customer service the girls gave even more!!!! To bad there's not enough people to be like Nikki, jasmine and Ashley!"}
{"text":"Took my husband for MY birthday because he was dying to go.  My entire family loved this place. Great food and service all around. We were all stuffed!  It's always so busy so I'm hoping they move to a larger location.   We'll be back very very soon!"}
{"text":"I've only been to this restaurant twice. Both times the food was delicious and the service was great! Joanne was very attentive and made sure that we were happy and satisfied. Definitely will be going there again in the near future."}
{"text":"Great crawfish but the other food options are rather mediocre as is the service. I've been here numerous times and the service is always painfully slow even on low traffic evenings. I'm inclined to believe staffing isn't the issue since I always see at least 5 employees working front end. We tend to average about a 5min wait to be seated, 5-10 min wait for drinks and a 20-40 min wait for food to show up, again even at off-peak times.   Regardless, the crawfish is truly great and I say this as someone with pretty high crawfish standards. I go for the Louisiana style because I love the spicy flavorful broth. Not a big fan of the other spices. The Hot N Juicy, for example, is a bit too thick for my tastes. Speaking of spice, I'd avoid anything above mild unless you have a really high spice tolerance. My buddy loves spice and his eyes were watering when he tried the Medium.   I'll add that sometimes they use corn and potato to count toward your per pound cost. Or at least it seems that way. My buddy and I did a side by side comparison of our crawfish and his was definitely considerably higher. The only difference is I ordered corn and potato and he did not.  I've also had the catfish, wings, fries, shrimp and crab, all of which were rather bland/one note. The catfish was underseasoned, the shrimp was severely overcooked and the crab was pretty thin. The cajun fries are pretty good (I'd avoid the regular fries at all costs...they lack even salt).  If you like Louisiana style crawfish, I recommend Hot N Juicy Crawfish. Just make sure you dont mind spending $13 a pound (not unreasonable for crawfish in the desert) and have a lot of time to wait. Otherwise, I'd avoid it. Frankly, nothing else on their menu is worth the time."}
{"text":"It is exactly what you expect. Don't expect frills, but they have great service and great food. 5 star worthy for that.  The only thing is that parking can be hard."}
{"text":"wow! messy!!!! the kids had no desire to do anything one Sunday so we decided that we would go on a little lunch date to hot n juicy..  we walked in thinking it'll be busy as hell and we'd have to wait.. but we were seated pretty quickly.  the smell of garlic butter is super intense once u walk in so u get a really good idea of what it taste like before tasting anything!  u sit at a table covered with a plastic bag.. so, that alone says a lot about what your getting into.  the menu is pretty strait forward with a good amount of things to choose from and it isn't overwhelming with options.    most are priced to market prices.. so you don't really know how much it is unless you ask. you choose what you'd like to get drenched as far as which of the four, five, or six? different sauces they offer:  hot n' juicy, lemon garlic.. [i forget the rest] and then choose what heat level you want your spice at.  we're rookies so we ordered what my friend michelle e ordered which was  a lb of shrimp and a lb of crawfish.. [we took head of the spice warning] and had mild spiced crawfish and medium spiced shrimp with a side of medium sauce.  the waitress was super friendly and very helpful.  when i asked her i was cracking the crawfish wrong.. or missing something   we put our bibs on and got to it!   sides:  rice and cajun fries.    the crawfish:  um, i was a little confused.  i realized late in the game that whatever i was looking for beneath the shell wasn't there, and that it was what it was.. which was nothing much.  so if your looking to find lots of meat?  it's not hiding under a crawfish shell.. BUT!  the juice was excellent!  the shrimp was VERY good.. succulent and full of juices.  surprisingly, either sauces were too hot for me... just REALLY garlic-y!    we were prepared to order more... but this was perfect for the both of us.  the garlic... lasts ALLLL day.  gum.. bring lots of gum.   mouthwash even.  and drink something to keep the burps down."}
{"text":"You gotta love a place that gives you a bib and wraps the table in a plastic bag. Here's a tip, don't wear white clothing to this place.  The food was fantastic. You order meat by the pound and pick your sauce. I went with their combo spice and picked 1lb in medium and 1lb in spicy. The crawfish was good but you get less meat for your money. The shrimp was delicious. We also had raw oysters which were also amazing.  I also tried the etoufee. It was pretty good but I've had better. Stick to the pounds of meat and you'll have a great time here getting messy with delicious seafood!"}
{"text":"My friends & I went here for lunch...the food & customer service were AWESOME!  It was not too crowded & our food arrived quicker than we expected.  My only complaint was the size & quantity of meat of the King Crab legs. I suggest attaching the paper towel roll to the side of the table. A table of four gets crowded & the roll took up a lot of table space. Overall rating...4 out of 5 stars! I definitely recommend this location."}
{"text":"I love this place! Is delicious  Its just a little pricy but I think is worth it. If you can't handle spicy don't get extra spicy lol Awesome seasoning and favorite is wet n juicy in a pound of shirmp"}
{"text":"I think crawfish is one of those things that people either love or hate. They have a texture, flavor, and look that you just have to get used to in order to enjoy crawfish. Personally, I have only started to try crawfish when it became popular here on the west coast with all of these new crawfish spots popping up all over. And again for me personally, I don't really like getting all messy while eating either, and I don't do well with spicy foods.   So how did I get here to Hot N Juicy with all those personal caveats I pointed out? Of course someone had to have a bday party here and I had to go. But, I do say I did enjoy the food here.  I got a half pound of their garlic butter shrimp at the baby wimpy spice level and a pound of the crawfish of the same seasoning. Butter really does make everything great and although the baby wimpy spice was kind of spicy for me - I drank a lot of water and took french fry breaks between cracking open crawfish and shrimps. Next time I think I will get a potato \"extra\" to go with the crawfish because it looked tasty in my friend's bag."}
{"text":"If you head out to Vegas and start craving hot and juicy crawfish this place won't disappoint.  Chances are if you've been to Boiling Crab then you will be familiar with the set up, menu, and experience.  I like the sauce here better then BC and the food here is amazingly fresh!  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Just freaking finger licking good I say! My friend and I had a pound each of shrimp with the hot & juicy seasoning. It was really good. How can you not grin when a pound of shrimp in a bag is put before you?   No need for utensils - use your hands!!! It's finger food to the max. We also had an order of garlic fries and can I just say - pure heaven. Definitely good stuff and it'll be one of my next stops when I'm in LV again!"}
{"text":"Keep in mind that there's a newer location opened east of this location. The newer place has a strong smell of paint, but that will easily be musked by the shrimps and crawfishes. Their sauces are pretty spicy and known to numb and swollen lips. If you are sensitive to spicy, start off with the mild. There are several choices of sauces and spicy levels to choose from. Prepare to get messy. They provide plastic bibs, paper towels, and plastic table clothes."}
{"text":"Really has gone down hill from its great start. First experience was in Vegas and was excited when Tempe opened. Service was horrible and the flavor is watered down from what I came to love. I have given them three chances and disappointed every time. DO NOT waste your $. Glendale really needs lessons on how you run a hot n not so juicy."}
{"text":"Um, I'm kinda in love with this place. I've been trying to come here for a few times, and even went once but the wait was too long for a large party.   This time, my lil sister Jenni took me here Saturday night around 7pm for dinner - just the two of us this time. This is Hot N Juicy II, a little further east than I, and the place seems more updated and less crowded than I.   It's such a fun environment. The waitresses are all super nice and laid back, there is Top 40 radio going on in the background, and everyone is eating with their hands! The wait a table for Jenni and I was about 20 minutes.   I love crawfish but the shrimp was recommended to get more bang for your buck and also because they're delicious, of course! We each got a pound of shrimp in the Hot N Juicy Special sauce (which is a combination of all the sauces they offer). The food came out in about 10 minutes, hardly any wait. The mild was a tiny bit spicy for me (I'm a big spice pansy) but perfect for that extra kick. The shrimp that arrived were perfectly seasoned in that amazing sauce, and were each a good size. We also got an order of sweet potato fries that were super tasty, well seasoned, and a generous portion at that. This was definitely the right amount of food for the two of us.   Our bill for 2 lbs of shrimp and an order of sweet potato fries came to be around $26 without tip. Not bad for a seafood dinner.   Tip: Jenni, a seasoned HNJC customer, recommends that you keep your wardrobe in mind when coming here. You tend to leave with your clothes smelling a little like garlic, and the scent definitely sticks on your hands for at least a day. :)"}
{"text":"I've been here several times and have loved it so much more each time. If you enjoy flavorful seafood then you need to come here. Get a pound of shrimp and a pound of clams with a corn and potato in hot n juicy baby spice or mild. Simply the best! That combination will have you running back about every two weeks! The spice runs on the hotter side, my husband who eats siracha or tabasco sauce on everything thinks the medium is too hot for him at times so that's why I recommend baby spice or mild. Oh and don't forget the Cajun fries and fried oysters! ....man I'm going back to-day!"}
{"text":"Great seafood restaurant in Las Vegas area. You'll have great time w/friends while eating most delicious spicy seafoods. Very casual and fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Being from the South I am a HUGE fan of anything Cajun related. Crawfish fall firmly under this heading ergo...  Went in on a Saturday night and the place was half full, but filling up fast. Got a great table with enough room so we could peel some crawfish and drink some beer. The place is clean and nice and has a family feel to it, namely because of the large tables for groups.   Sat down and immediately ordered crawfish, oysters, mussels and dungeness crab. We also ordered some beer. Their selection is small and disappointing, but if you like domestics and Sapporo you should be okay.   Very quickly out come bags of crawfish. They were tiny, but that was sort of okay because I knew that they were out of season. Still you're really paying for a lot of body and very little meat this time of year.  I ordered mine very spicy, you can choose how you want them seasoned. I wanted them to burn, which they did. The friend I was with got his mild and they were okay. I'm a huge fan of hot, so. We also got the mussels which were my very, very favorite. I could have just eaten them. They had this nice, garlic-y sauce and were tender and tasty! The oysters weren't tops shelf, I probably would never get them from here again, but put a little cocktail sauce on them and they're edible. Also ordered the dungeness crab. WASTE. DO NOT BUY. It was probably the worst waste of $30 I've ever spent and just thinking about it upsets me. You get a huge crab with big legs and you crack it open and the meat is mealy. You don't pull it out in big, chunky pieces, it actually can be gotten out with a spoon. If the company I had been with wasn't so awesome I would have pitched a FIT. Gross.  The service here is pretty sporadic. One minute they're fawning over you, next twenty minutes you're asking where the beer is you've asked for five times.   I probably won't ever go back here, but it was nice to see what the (over) hype was about.  Edited to add: If you're expecting Louisiana crawfish you will be disappointed, this tastes nothing like it. It's their own made up something that is decent, but NOT cajun. Also, they give you gloves if you don't want  your hands to smell fishy for three days - that was a nice touch."}
{"text":"Best Cajun seafood I've had since I've lived in Mississippi! Service is okay...but the food makes up for it, I promise."}
{"text":"Tiffany was awesome. Had an amazing dinner. Get the combo flavor spicy with corn and potato in the bag. We got lobster, shrimp, and crawfish."}
{"text":"We recently noticed the one that opened by us on Eastern. We had an ok experience overall taking my family here for lunch.  The waitresses were great but the grub was sub par and over priced.   Im pretty sure they didn't make our order separate as far as spices.  I like as hot as they can make it and my wife is completely white bread and water spicy,  my wifes food was spicy enough she could barely eat it and mine was just mild to me.   It was extra $$$ to get some extra spicy sauce on the side but the extra sauce wasnt as spicy as the food came with.   1 lb clams,  1 lb blue crabs,  2 orders of calamari a corn ,2 beers,  soda and kids chicken,  $75 bucks.  Im a little guy and wasn't close to full.  Ok lunch but I probably wont come back."}
{"text":"We were so so impressed tonight. We were supposed to go to another restaurant but decided last minute we'd try this \"Crawfish place\" out. Our waitress, Rachel, was so great at explaining to us how everything worked and how to order since we've never been there. We got lobster clams and king crab legs and wow wow wow ... The food was absolutely amazing!! We couldn't stop saying how great everything was. The team of waitstaff works so well together and checking on tables while others are busy. Alexis checked on us before leaving and I will say these are some of the most fun people around. I'd prob go back just to hang out with Rachel and Alexis Hahahha. Truly amazing wait staff. (They deserve a raise)  amazing job with this new restaurant and I can honestly say in the 6 years that we have lived in the area this is now our new favorite restaurant. We'll be seeing you again. Thank you, Tyler and Danielle (the It Works girl haha) 315-244-2001"}
{"text":"The crawfish tasted fresh and clean! I loved this place so much. The service was amazing and the servers were all beautiful! Get the hot and juicy medium. I like my food spicy but that day I was not feeling spicy. The medium has perfect spice. The crawfish was so good we had to order 5 more pounds. LOL. The clams were okay because they were a little undercooked. But overall the food was excellent."}
{"text":"This is probably my seafood restaurant in Tempe.  You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Food and service is great!"}
{"text":"Warning #1: be prepared to smell like garlic awesomeness! So maybe leave anything you don't want to smell in your car...  Warning #2: if you get anything else other than shrimp you'll most likely leave hungry since most of the other choices don't have much meat in them and also the sauce doesn't get through the hard shells as well.   I give 5 stars for the shrimp in hot n juicy sauce. I get spicy level medium, but I always have friends start off with mild because you can easily add spice, but you can't take it away. Warning #3: the shrimp have their full bodies...I love it but my friend had her hubby do the dirty work of breaking them a part.    5 stars for the Cajun fries, but warning #4, they are usually on the spicy side. Sweet potatoes fries are thin and crunchy.   GET THE CORN IN YOUR BAG! You'll thank me! The Mr. gets potatoes too, but they aren't anything special to me.   My bro always gets the oysters and even though I'm not big on oysters they're actually really good here."}
{"text":"Um, super disappointing. I am a HUGE Boiling Crab fanatic (as in, their main Twitter account has actually ONCE TWEETED BACK TO ME, that's how legit I am. Gosh, you don't even know. LOL *flips hair*) so I was really excited that Hot and Juicy would be, at the very least, a semi-decent stand-in for BC until I can trek back to California.  No. We ordered the hot and juicy lb of shrimp at the spiciest level. It was just.. not tasty. Barely any garlic. And NOT SPICY AT ALL.  I literally opened up five packets of Taco Bell Diablo sauce to try and kick up the shrimp a notch. Keep in mind, I already asked for the spiciest level. The shrimp was just... tasteless.  The Cajun fries kinda sucked. They were already soggy when we got them. So sad."}
{"text":"The food was excellent!! Crab legs, shrimp, and crawfish were worth a little inconvenience. However, we waited 20 minutes after being seated for our drink orders to be taken. And still waited another 10 to actually receive our drinks. Will definitely give it another try, because the food came out hot and full of flavor!"}
{"text":"After reading all the reviews regarding horrible/ bad customer service, we went into the restaurant expecting the worst customer service. As soon as we walked in we were greeted and had a table ready within 5 minutes. Our server( I can't recall his name) was really cool. The shrimp and the crab legs were AMAZING!!!!! We also ordered the green mussels which where good but not as good as their shrimp. This is a place were we will be going back to. We  were very impressed with everything,"}
{"text":"The food is great. The service is so-so. This location is nice and clean. Not much in terms of decor.  On football game days, it's BOGO beer on all beers, which is pretty awesome. Be sure to ask for the full beer list as they don't automatically bring you that menu.  Unfortunately, when we went, they were out of blue crab. So we went for the Alaskan king crab and shrimp. The shrimp you can order by the 1/2 lb, which is nice. (Everything is minimum 1 lb.)  We went with the garlic butter seasoning with medium spice for the king crab and the hot 'n' juicy seasoning with spicy spice for the shrimp. It is definitely spicy! (And I say that as someone who loves spicy things.) We also ordered the cajun fries (which were loaded with seasoning). (Tip: Ask for a side of ranch for the fries.) The Alaskan king crab legs were gigantic! Some of the biggest I've ever seen (including in Alaska).  All the food was yummy. I liked that they gave you gloves as well as bibs. This really helped IMHO as your hands didn't get covered in sauce and seasoning.  We were never offered another drink or if we wanted any other food. We had to ask for several tools. So like I said, not exactly good service. But the seasoning was on point and the seafood was fresh and yum. So I'd be willing to overlook the service issues and eat here again."}
{"text":"Saw this place on Man vs. Food and HAD to try it out during our vacation. It's noisy and fun, great service and great food. I'd never been to a place like that so it was fun to get messy. The crawfish were very tasty and filled me up just nice. I'd recommend trying it out at least once for the experience if you've never had it before."}
{"text":"If you love seafood and you don't mind getting down a little dirty then this is the place for you.  You will be seated at a spot in the restaurant with a table top covered directly in plastic, provided with plastic bibs and a roll of paper towels.  There are no plates here, your food comes out straight to you in plastic bags full of wonderful spices and aromas.  No frets here it is very clean.     If it is your first time visiting let the waiter or waitress explain to you have everything works (the staff are very helpful and they know their seafood and flavors).  They specialize in Crawfish but you can have any of the following: shrimp, Dungeness crab, blue crab, oysters, king crab, snow crab, lobster or crabs.  Then you pick a seasoning and a spice level.  That night my husband and I enjoyed shrimp hot n juicy spice level medium, crawfish hot n juicy spice level medium and crawfish garlic butter spice level medium.  Hands down the hot n juicy combo was are favorite, it hits all the taste buds just right and shall I sum it up by saying umami.  The Garlic butter is okay but if I try it again I will get it spicy.  ***If you do order two pounds of crawfish you will receive on corn on the cob and potato in your flavor bag and it soaks up the flavor amazingly.***  The crawfish here are not tiny and their shrimp are a great size too.  We also order their calamari and was pleasantly surprised to find it extremely fresh, it taste like it is hand dipped in their own batter and then fried (not the pre-frozen kind).  If you have children that do not know how to pick crab, shrimp or crawfish this is not the place because you will end up doing all the picking for them and they will do all the eating."}
{"text":"I'm not surprised why so many people come here to get their seafood fix! However, I won't be going to this location anymore due to the service I received from Miss Lemonade.  My friend and I arrived around 5 and we were seated right away. Since this was my first time I took a little bit longer to look through the menu. However our server Miss lemonade asked if we were ready to order but we were still deciding so we politely said we aren't ready yet. She left giving us an impatient attitude.   Since we both weren't that hungry we decided on 1lb of pound of shrimp ( Hot N Juicy flavor with mild spice) and sweet potato fries to share.  Our food arrived really fast, but boy was it good. I was slightly disappointed with the fries since it was super bland. I prefer Boiling Crab's fries. However I must say I do like their shrimp better.   As we were still eating the server asked if we wanted more and we said no. Then 10 minutes later she asked again and politely we said no again and stormed off with an attitude again to get our check. If you're using credit card be prepared to show ID.   Anyways great food but service needs to be improved."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with a boil.  I normally order a pound of crawfish or shrimp, Cajun + mild. With a side of Cajun fries. The wait is always long on the weekends but don't let it scare you away- they do move fairly fast.   It's a little weird because they serve the fries in such a huge basket that the presentation looks like the serving was half eaten.   This particular visit, I ordered my crawfish with corn; however, they must have forgotten the corn. I was able to inform the server and she was very helpful- giving me the option to still add it or remove it from my check.   Speaking of check- something I noticed that was different than I'm use to is how the bill is split up. Usually whenever my party splits a bill, the restaurant will leave a suggested gratuity based off of the share that you are paying. However, here, even with the split amount printed on the receipt, the suggested gratuity is still based off of the grand total. If you don't pay attention, you could accidentally end up tipping 40+%.   Due to location you also have to pay for parking since it is on Mill Ave. So quite honestly, the food was not bad but I'll probably find myself at the Angry Crab more often unless I am going for lunch or dinner before or after a movie at the AMC Theater at the end of the complex."}
{"text":"This place changed my life. Haha first cajun boil I ever had.  I've been addicted to these restaurants ever since. Hot n juicy is by far THE BEST!"}
{"text":"Good place to eat if you like crawfish. Not the best but it's hard to compare it when you've had the best. There's only one place in the world to get crawfish better than The Ragin Cajun in Houston, and that is at my house in Mexico where three times a year we have it shipped in live from Louisiana and have a great crawfish feed."}
{"text":"Back again and just as happy!  Trent was awesome again and we were so happy to see him!  So friendly and went out of his way to take our initial order even though he wasn't our waiter.  He is awesome!!!  Rich, our waiter did an amazing job!  Super attentive and kept our drinks refilled and our other requests on time!  The manager (I didn't catch her name). Was very interested in our experience and took her time listening to us.  She was really good too!  Overall, another great experience, we can't wait for the west side location!!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love Hot N Juicy!  Everything was perfect once again.  The corn fritters were awesome as were the medium hot n juicy shrimp!  Laura was awesome..super attentive and personable.  Thanks hot n juicy for another great meal!"}
{"text":"One of my new favorite places to eat in Vegas!  I'm a Southern girl and grew up eating mudbugs (crawfish) piled high on backyard picnic tables.  It's next to impossible to find really good Cajun crawdaddies outside of the deep south so I usually avoid trying because I'm almost always disappointed.  I have found the mudbug holy trail though!!  My guy is a Yankee and my mom and I are on a mission to southernize him as best we can hehe.  So one night crawdaddies were brought up and I realized I had a major hankering for the little red guys I had heard good things about this place so I decided to give it a go so I could quench my craving and take my guy's crawdad virginity, two birds, one stone and all that hullabaloo.   We got there and there was about a twenty minute wait.  We had to wait outside cause the place is pretty packed with tables.  We were seated and our server was very nice and took the time to explain how things worked.  You order your protein (crawdaddies, shrimp, soft-shelled crabs etc) by the pound and choose your seasoning (Cajun, garlic butter etc) and they bring them out in bags.  No plates in this place...the tables are draped in plastic, there are plastic bibs available...you may look sill but they are definitely needed, those suckers might be small but they are seriously messy!  This is not the place to go if you plan to do anything afterwards.    We ordered a couple pounds if crawfish with Cajun seasoning and an order of corn fritters.  I love spicy food, he doesn't.  It was a hit with us both, not too spicy and not too mild.  The fritters were divine and a good sized serving for the two of us.   The big bonus was the price.  The market price of the crawdaddies that day was $7/lb, the next day I was at the grocery store and there were frozen crawfish for $6.75 for a little under a pound and you still had to cook them and do the cleaning up afterwards.  I'd gladly pay a quarter more to not have to do the work!  I haven't stopped raving about this place and keep dropping hints as often as I can that I'm jonsin' to go back.  I see some more head suckin' in my future (the heads are where all the yummy bits are, if you don't suck the heads you are mission out!) See y'all soon lil mudbugs!"}
{"text":"OYSTERS on a half shell! These were fresh, plump and delicious. The crawfish and crawfish etoufee was alright, but the oysters brings me back every time."}
{"text":"Love this place and love the staff, it's convenient great for locals and closer to home. Shoutout to Gen"}
{"text":"Excellent place! The service was amazing and the food was oh soooooo yummy! Great seafood! We had the king crab and shrimp. The shrimp was perfect and actually larger than I expected. The only huge issue with this place is the parking...we all know how mill ave can be but we had to walk so far to his place from where it took us forever to find a parking spot!  But all in all this restaurant was amazing :)"}
{"text":"it's fun for a group... but it's salty as hell and packed with MSG. i had a searing head ache half way through the meal.  we got dungenus crab and shrimp. it's really a hit or miss. you have to drink a lot of beer to get through the meal"}
{"text":"Sorry people but im going to have to be the fly in the ointment here. I got a chance to go to Hot and Juicy last weekend to see what all the hub bub was all about. And yes I saw it on Man V Food and it looked interesting. All the great reviews on here didnt hurt either. Well I walked in and it was kinda plain but thats fine. The girl seated us and gave us menus to look over. I was going to order the shrimp instead of the crawfish until the waitress came over. She made the crawfish sound so good I caved and ordered a pound of them. I also ordered a pound of the king crab and some sausage. My mom ordered the fried shrimp and frys.      The girl brought out our food and it smelled incredible. I ripped into the bag of crawfish in hopes that I was really in for a treat. Well I have come to a conclusion, THERES NOTHING EDIBLE ON CRAWFISH!!! These things fought me every step of the way. I worked my ass off just to get a \"TINNY\" piece of tale meat. The waitress said they were actually bigger than normal. I would hate the see the regular ones. The flavor of the sauce was absolutely fantastic. I went with the hot and juicy special medium. The sausage dipped in the sauce was out of this world but the crawfish was a miserable failure. I ended up ordering a pound of the shrimp as well.     Now the shrimp was another issue. I am not a big fan of whole shrimp. I dont want the head on with all the little hairs all over and the whole thing. If they had been cleaned before cooking it would have been much better. I didnt eat allot of them because of this. The crab legs were pretty good but I should have ordered the same sauce instead of the garlic butter.      Hot and Juicy was kinda fun and the 2 waitresses were really sweet and fun to chat with. I dont think I will be coming but though. I do wish them the best."}
{"text":"Cool place, first time there; reccomended by a friend.  Very busy but got pretty good service. The seafood is good and spices are tasty, I stayed with medium heat as it was my first time and didn't know what to expect.  I plan to go back and go a little hotter!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing customer service and the food is amazing. The only problem is the food is very spicy so go easy on the spice."}
{"text":"Yummy!!!!!!! I loceeeee thier hot n juicy sauce with their boil shrimp it's so good and so spicy!!! I'm not really big on crawfish at all so I never really eat it or order it when I go there."}
{"text":"ONE OF THE BEST SEAFOOD HOT SPOTS IN LAS VEGAS! Whenever we visit, we must dine here! We did not have to wait and were immediately seated! Pricing is decent. The staff and service is very friendly and diligent! As for the food, super flavorful, clean and DELICIOUS!   Glad there's two locations!"}
{"text":"I searched the food network and found man versus food. I searched for this restaurant. The shrimp was fresh and it was actually tasty. In regards to the cajun fries, it was in \"pika.\" I had ordered the clams and they met the taste the I was looking for.   I stayed here back in April and the service was inviting since the store closed and they still allowed me to pickup my to go food."}
{"text":"Food quality : fresh Food quantity: 1 lb green mussel has 7 pieces with small pieces inside shell, Cajun fries is in abundance, 1 lb shrimp smaller in size than buckets of crab. Food arrived within 15 minutes. Servers disappeared after food arrived.  Had to ask for more water.  Waiter forgot a persons food after asking several times. Food was taken off bill. So he didn't eat anything.   Would have been a 5 if order wasn't messed up on and food quantity was more.  Still waiting for check. Not a good service for after eating."}
{"text":"The establishment is pretty small to hold a business such as this and parking is horrendous. Highly compared to Boiling Crab in southern California, Hot N Juicy doesn't delve much from the popular food-in-a-bag chain. I'm not too sure if the food comes out based on when the guests get there or when the food is done but often times, I've noticed it comes out really randomly. Sometimes, the other guests got their food before me when I ordered before them.  If you're looking for a mirror of Boiling Crab, Hot N Juicy is it.  I'd recommend something different to make this restaurant a gem in Las Vegas and not a copy of Boiling Crab.  People COULD start saying, \"Oh Boiling Crab? That's like Hot N Juicy in Vegas!\" Right? :)"}
{"text":"This place is overrated.  It's really pricey for what you get.  But I guess in Las Vegas you can't get that much better.    What we ordered: 4 lbs crawfish (2 lb Hot n juicy special & 2 juicy Cajun) The Juicy Cajun was a lot better in my opinion.  The medium was not spicey.   The spicy was good. You could taste it on the corn but not so much the crawfish.  It seemed like it was not boiled in the sauce and the sauce was tossed on afterwards.  The flavor had not soaked into the crawfish.  I don't usually comment about the cleanliness of bathrooms, but man...these bathrooms were gross.  Trash was everywhere.  Service: Waitress was friendly enough. Looks like the trendy place to be. But I'd rather not get my crawfish in LV.  Probably would not eat here the next time we visit."}
{"text":"Total clueless employees. Hostess stood there looking at me for en extended period of time with a blank look on her face.   First time I went, I ordered their cracklings to start. Asked for extra Cajun seasoning on the side. The waitress informed me they could not give me any because it was a secret recipe and they were afraid someone would steel it and walked off. I asked a second waitress who insisted to take my fresh cracklings back to the kitchen so they could apply their super secret rub. I thought it was kind of odd. None of the waitresses were able to tell me much about their food other than what's written on the menu.   The second time I came in at 1835 on a Tuesday evening. Asked to be seated in the patio. Hostess rudely told me that he patio was closed since they didn't have a server out there. Just a quick observation there were about 3:1 employees vs. customers in the main dining room. They didn't look short staffed. I'm sure they could have had a waitress walk a few extra feet to the patio on a beautiful Arizona evening.   I guess another open establishment would much rather have my 100 bucks that evening. I hope corporate would give their staff of ditsy girls better training since they are the face of the business to the general public."}
{"text":"great food, service was ok. This is not a place you go to eat very often but when you do, you gotta go big!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here serval times before not because I'm a huge crawfish fan but it's because everyone I know is. Every time before have been just good but this time I really did enjoyed everything.  This is the original Hot n Juicy of Las Vegas and has always been legit except for the parking. Parking kinda sucks but that doesn't stop us or anyone else from coming. The atmosphere is great and service has gotten even better through out the years. That is all because they are staffed with fun young servers to hype the joint up which makes it a exciting experience.   The music is hip, there are TVs all around and they have plenty of seating for the amount of space they have. To keep the place cool from the hot Vegas weather they have tons of ceiling fans which really keeps the Resturant comfortable. The day we went was pretty chilly outside so inside it was actually pretty cold, good for the summer days but not that day.   If you are not a big crawfish person like myself not to worry they have other items on the menu like Chicken wings, shrimp, clam, calamari, catfish and nuggets with fries basket. There is also étouffée which is like Jambalaya and it was really really good. The oysters we ordered was so good, fresh and juicy. The potatoes and corn that soak in the Cajun juice is always amazing and my favorite part of the bag. With the right amount of spice and the right amount of Cajun the shrimps was delicious. The craw fish wasn't bad as well I just don't care for them. The fried calamari was battered and seasoned just right and paired with their season fries it really hits the spot.   Don't forget it's always fun to eat at a place where you are required to wear a big plastic bib and gloves to fully enjoy your food. Or maybe get a Polaroid taken to be put up on the walls to remember a bday celebration or just to say you've eaten at a place that was featured on Man vs Food. But no matter what don't forget to try this place it's worth it."}
{"text":"I have been back here twice since I wrote my original review. The manager attempted to contact me after the original posting, but I decided not to reply. I instead chose to give them another chance. I, in fact, visited twice since then and I am happy to report that the service is excellent and the food tasty. The oysters on a half shell were very fresh. I highly recommend the étouffée and if you order some shrimp, try them with the \"whole shabang\"."}
{"text":"The boiling crab has a much better sauce. Service was good tho. But I'd rather go to TBC instead for the money we spent.   *** update ! Manager contacted me and the second time around everything was delicious and perfect ! Thank u !"}
{"text":"Uber driver suggested this place while we were in town for a conference. Great choice! Our server, Tre, was very helpful in helping us determine what we wanted to eat. It was our first time visiting. My bag was pretty simple with shrimp, a couple of potatoes, and corn. I got the hot & juicy flavoring medium spicy. It was excellent. They have one at home in West Hollywood so we'll try that one out too."}
{"text":"This place was awesome!  I wish i had known there was one in Phoenix as well...  Glad I read the reviews, I love spicy, but I was the only one in my group that did so we go the \"baby spice\" option.  Even that had some heat.  I was happy, but a few others were whining."}
{"text":"One word to describe this place: DELICIOUS!!!!! This is by far theee best seafood restaurant I've ever been to....the baby cajun spice crab leg sauce is off the charts!! Don't be intimidated by the food wrapped  in plastic bags...you'll need it to avoid getting that delicious crab leg sauce all over yourself! Also get the rice and corn on cob. You can put some sauce on top of the rice and enjoy!"}
{"text":"We went here on a Saturday afternoon and they weren't too busy. Only 2 waitress on staff so service was kind of slow. My dad ordered the fried catfish and cajan fries. He said the fish was watered down (clearly it had been previously frozen, yes I know we are far from the beach so fresh fish is hard to find) and the fries were way too hot. My fiancé and I ordered the Drool. It was plenty of food! We ordered the flavor Hot N Juicy and spice Mild. So glad I didn't go any hotter because Mild was way to hot and I love spicy food. They need to slow down on the spices. Other then that the fish they used for the baskets were very fresh.  I would return but not waste so much money on a lot of food."}
{"text":"I gave this place two stars  because the food was good the crab is simply delicious and so are the corn fritters. However I order the corn fritters 10 minutes before we even placed our order and they came with the meal even though I  requested we get them first also it took me about an hour and a half to eat the crab because this place had no knives or forks I asked for a knife and a fork and they brought me a plastic knife and a plastic fork give me a break I don't think I should have to bring my own utensils.  So needless to say I won't be going back that did it for me."}
{"text":"I never thought I would come across a restaurant that could knock my favorite steak place off the charts, but this is now my #1 FAVORITE RESTAURANT IN THE WHOLE WORLD - not just for seafood, any food!  I never even liked garlic before Hot N Juicy; the place permeates with a deep garlicky, buttery smell as soon as you drive up (and so will you for 3 days after you eat here).  Get the crawfish, get the shrimp, get the crab, but whatever you do, get it in the special sauce.  There's something in that \"SPECIAL\" sauce that's indescribable but keeps me coming back week after week - could it be crack, could it be heroin?  I don't know, but I'm an addict for life.  If I ever become allergic to shellfish (knock on wood), my family have specific instructions to put me outta my misery.  Or, I'll just die eating at my favorite restaurant Hot N Juicy.  Trust me, you will not be disappointed; the wait is worth it.  Go before 6pm to avoid a looooong wait.  It's busy all days of the week.  Make sure to get the corn, some sausages and add a bowl of rice to catch all the juices as they run off your hands when cracking the crawfish, shrimp, and crab.  Squeeze the head juice into the rice for extra flavor.  Eat the rice last, yum!  Damn you Adam Richman for telling everyone about Las Vegas locals' best hole-in-the-wall seafood place.  I feel sorry for the tourists that do try Hot N Juicy and then go home craving it because it's so amazing - I'm lucky to be living here in LV so I can eat there whenever I want!!!  I'm waiting to hear someone say they moved to LV for Hot N Juicy LOL!  I just checked out the Boiling Crab in San Jose and Hot & Juicy is stll the winner in my book.  Sauce is more buttery and savory and the servers are the greatest here in LV."}
{"text":"Are you willing to get down and dirty for some delicious seafood!? Then this is the place to be! I've been here about 4 times in the last month. First, I was invited then I invited other friends and family to try, and everyone is in love w hot n juicy restaurant! My server Javi was also very attentive, educated, and very personable! Great server! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Damn good craw fish & shrimp."}
{"text":"Love this place. A little pricey but so worth it.. If you are craving crawfish in Las Vegas come here. Their seasoning is well balanced and the spices give you enough kick without overpowering the seafood. I recommend getting there early because there is almost always a wait."}
{"text":"so we went for the first time on a thursday about 12 o clock we went in and it wasnt very busy. the service was good we ordered the 1 pound of shrimp and 1 pound of king crab(not so much in 1lb!) the shrimp were in garlic butter and  spicy level...yeah they were spicy alright!! and the king crab had the hot and juicy special seasoning and medium spice level and that was good! u dont get plates or silverware other than what u need for the crab. it was great but we didnt have much time to enjoy it since our daughter had a doctors appointment! but next time we go it will be enjoyed better!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been craving crawfish since I dined here over Labor Day weekend. We were in Vegas for my sisters birthday and if you know anything about me and my sister is that we love food.  Our trip was planned around where we would be eating the entire time.  That's how we roll.  We came here on a Friday night and luckily got seated right away.  We had heard of long long wait times so we planned on coming earlier than later.    Once seated, we looked at the menu and ordered up our meal.  4lbs of Hot and Juicy crawfish for my sister and me, oysters for me and the hubs and he and my brother in law ordered shrimp.  Although the service was slow, the food was not.  They were brought to us in plastic bags all steaming and full of flavor.  The crawfish were ah-mazing.  They were so hot to the touch that I didn't care if my tongue got burnt. I could not get enough of them.  The seasoning was addicting and wanted to have it on everything.  The boys were done eating before sis and I even really got started.  We can put a lot back.  Come here.  Don't walk. Run.  Or drive since its off the strip.  You will thank me.  But just a warning, your clothes will smell like the food.  It's that potent."}
{"text":"How pathetic can you be?! Sooooo what I'm getting is after getting a 1 star two days ago from someone that made a review about a waiter named max and how horrible he did as a waiter then all of a sudden the next day max becomes a super man and was the waiter to all these people that made a review about how super man max was the best server ever?? How pathetic can you get and more obvious?!! I'm trying to read legit reviews and what I'm getting is you guys are making up your own reviews to make the place look good -.- not cool at all!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to have a whole crab so I rolled into this place. They did deliver a fresh dungeness crab; although, at a price. A price you wouldn't know if you didn't think to ask up front.  Now, apparently according to some folks, if you see a price for crab or lobster on a board you assume it's per pound. Sure, maybe I've been living under a rock but if I see a price next to dungeness crab and there isn't \"/lb\" or \"per pound\" next to it, I'm going to think it's the price of the crab.  If you look at the menu it says \"market price\" but I've never read anything in economics advising that the unit of measure is always by pound.   I've ordered seafood at many places, fish markets, casual and fine dining, from across the country and I have never been uncertain about what I was going to pay at the end. For example, at R & D in Newport Beach, they list fish as \"market price\" but the server will tell you exactly what the whole plate will cost.  Now, I can't say what would've happened if I had known it was per pound and asked the server how much it's going to weigh, but it's a nasty surprise to somebody who didn't know how \"these places\" work. Nobody should have to make this mistake just to find out. Would it be that difficult to add per pound to the board or menu?  I can't recommend you eat here at Hot N Juicy Crawfish because if you aren't certain about how much you're going to get or what you're going to pay for it, it's not fair."}
{"text":"First time writing a review and nothing like this has happened to me so I felt the need to share...  The hostess and waitress were nice at first... Boyfriend and I ordered our food... So we're waiting and waiting, and finally looking at how long it was been, 40 minutes already in.. People that got there AFTER us were already getting their food. I didn't think much of it. Until a waitress came up to us asking if we paid already... I told him no, we're still waiting on our food. He says okay and he comes back 5 minutes later asking \"are you sure? Because there's nothing in the system for your table\" I told him we've been here for almost an hour and still haven't got our food. Our waitress comes over asking what was wrong. He started rambling on to her that she never put the order in for us. She put it in for another table. She gives a half smile and says sorry. So whatever I let it go cause I just want the food at this point.. We got a pound of shrimp out.. My boyfriend's pound of shrimp. I didn't want to pick at his food cause my food is about to come out. 30 minutes after, he's done with his food and I haven't got mine or the rest of his order. The waitress comes to us with our check trying to charge us everything we ordered but we only ever got one bag of shrimp. He's says he's sorry and he'll have a manager talk to us. I see him talking to the manager, some small Asian female with short hair. She never came to our table, 20 min after I gave up. Paid for the food, went up to the manger myself and told her what was going on. All I got was \"oh I'm sorry, we're new but I'll make sure to put it in so we can improve. Hope to see you again.\" WOW poor poor poor service. Our waitress was so embarrassed to come back to our table after mixing up our order.  Never got my food after 2 hours of sitting there. They need better service. *thumbs down*"}
{"text":"I love this place! I always get the snow crab because the crawfish hardly have any meat on them. Be prepared to smell like garlic for the rest of the day, it's worth it though! I always add rolls to my order because I Love sopping up the sauce with the bread. Order conservatively when it comes to the heat of your sauce. Even the baby spice and mild have a little kick. Do yourself a favor and get the original hot n juicy sauce. And whatever you do, wash your hands and nails thoroughly before touching your eyes!"}
{"text":"This place is the best nothing like it around sometimes I am here twice a day when they open and close. Always get the same crawfish hot n' juicy med and shrimp lemon pepper med as it always seems to work. They have a wide variety of seasonings and spice levels that will suit anyone. If you can try and get Billy as he is a terrific server at first I thought he was the manager because he knows everything about this place and can be honest with any questions you have. Just try it you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"Bad bad bad! Won't return. Too expensive for frozen crawfish that taste bad, corn soggy, horrible service, yuck!  Two times and tries and they still stink!"}
{"text":"We ordered 2 lbs if crawfish, mussels, oysters, & king crab legs. The crawfish tasted like lake water crawfish. Trust me, they are not flown in from Louisiana.  I grew up there and know the difference. The potatoes were all so hard you couldn't eat them, the mussels and crab were good. After $85, we had to go eat across the street at Zips!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible Cajun food!  who knew the best Cajun food in Las Vegas are by the Chinese!  It's like the best Chinese food in TX is cooked by the Mexicans... haha..  Try it and you won't regret it.. Guaranteed!"}
{"text":"The next best thing to boiling crab! The last few times I've been to vegas, I have eaten here for lunch. It is delicious! Their hot and juicy special mix is yummy! The last few times I've been here, the service is great! The waitresses are attentive and very friendly! Food comes out pretty quickly, and prices are fair! It surprises me how fresh the crawfish are! I heard they fly them in daily. YUM =)   The oysters are also really good. The cajun fries are ok. I think the boiling crab ones is way better but what matters most, is the sauce for the seafood (which is delicious!)  My boyfriend left his credit card here and we were able to come back and retrieve it. So glad the staff didn't steal the credit card =) When we were getting his card back, we noticed there was like 6 other credit cards that people left. They kept it safe in the cash register! Thanks hot n juicy!!"}
{"text":"Not as busy as boiling crab so the service is a lot better.  The hot n spicy flavoring is the way to go and all for more of a kick.  I almost couldn't handle the medium level of spiciness.   Good change of pace."}
{"text":"I love me some Hot N' Juicy! This particular location is located in the corner of a busy strip mall on Eastern right before Silverado Ranch Blvd. I almost missed it because the sign was out and it was dark. They were not too busy when we arrived, and were seated promptly. The staff were friendly throughout our time here.  So this is a seafood place but with a twist. They have your standard fried seafood items like clams and shrimp, also po-boys and fries. But I come for the seafood by the pound and it's unlike any other place I have been. How it works is you pick your seafood and you can choose from: shrimp, clams, crawfish, various types of crab, lobster and mussels. Everything is market price so it can change daily. Then you pick your sauce which the seafood is tossed in. I always get the Hot N Juicy which is all of the sauces mixed together, but they have lemon pepper and cajun to name a few. Lastly you choose your heat from baby spice all the way to SPICY. Everything is then tossed together in a plastic bag which then is served to you hot at the table. You eat with your hands which can get messy so they provide bibs and gloves.   Although crab is my fav. it's pricey, so this visit I got the shrimp and it was $14.99/lb. I only got half a pound and added sausage and potato to my bag and a side of white rice, with the hnj seasoning, mild. This was the first time I've tried mild and it was a bit too spicy for me. I will probably stick with baby spice from here on out. The sauce is extremely delicious though, chock full of garlic and lemon and butter with cajun spices. This is why I get the rice so I can sop up all that deliciousness. The shrimp come whole which is a minor annoyance having to peel them. Even with gloves, be prepared to smell like a vampires worst nightmare for a couple days. I had garlic coming out of my pores. I really enjoy this place and will come back soon."}
{"text":"I loved this place only for the food. The service could have been better, but it wasn't super terrible. I came here with a bunch of coworkers during dinner time. It was really busy, but didn't take that long to get seated. There was 10 of us. I loved the shrimp, but my boyfriend didn't like the crab too much. Took a while to get refills and they forgot a to go order for our friend, but nothing too bad to keep me away. I'll definitely come again another time. Oh one more thing they don't have a big parking lot so you might have to park in the dark alley way..."}
{"text":"Wow where do I start!?!? Hole in the wall... small tables... long line? Yes!!! This is heading the right direction! The menu is simple to read and prices are more than reasonable. I was a first timer and I am telling you that bib totally saved my pretty lil shirt. I got 1 pound of shrimp in spicy cajun, snow crab in the hot n juicy sauce also spicy AND the yummy lil corn fritters. Lemme tell you this... best food experience Ive had since moving to Vegas. My fingers smelt and tasted like yummyness for hours almost days even after many hand washes lol! I will be back with my streechy pants and don;t even ask me if I wanna wear them weak ass rubber gloves! Ima G! G's do it raaaaw lol"}
{"text":"Hot N Juicy you let me down. I have had this place bookmarked FOR-EV-ER and jumped at the chance to go last night when a friend invited me. I got there at 730 and asked for a table for 3, they said 25 minute wait, no problem. About 8:05 they called my name and sat us in the back in a half booth but it had a square table so it was really akward. A round table would have been much better.  To eat, I ordered 1lb of shrimp with the hot n' juicy seasoning, and then added a piece of corn and potato. My friends both ordered 1lb of king crab with lemon pepper and juicy cajun seasonings. Right after our server took our order, a big party of 15 came in and was seated right next to us. Our server tended to them immediately. After about 25 minutes we have had no refills, and we have no food. I start to notice that people who came in AFTER us are getting their food. I joke and say \"I think they forgot about us.\" We stop a waitress and ask whats going on and she tells us some bullshit lie that our food is coming but that we have the king crab and that can take a little bit longer. Now its been at least 45 minutes and no food. Our server finally comes to our table and tells us she is so sorry and so embarassed but she forgot to put our order in, but she put it in right now and it is being pushed to the front of the line. Now at this point im PISSED off. She was soo worried about serving the table of 15 and just forgot about us. Before we even get our food the table of 15 is already starting to get appetizers. Our food finally came around 9:10 and it was good thats why the 2 stars. The hot n juicy seasoning is delicious but SOO garlicky. I still smell like garlic today. I tried some of my friends lemon pepper crab and that was reallly good. For 2lbs of king crab and 1lb of shrimp our total was like $80 which is not bad. But I will not be back because of the shitty service. I will try the other location a little bit down the street and hope we dont get forgotten about.  FYI the servers  name is ASHLEY, dont get her because she FORGETS everything! Even the people next to us were mad because she forgot to add potatoes and corn to their bag."}
{"text":"Came in yesterday for lunch, always been at their spring mountain location. I was in debate between taco y Taco or hot n juicy. Of course hot n juicy takes the win. We were greeted promptly and our server introduced himself as Max. He was very knowledgeable with the menu. Max constantly checked up on our table consistently filling up our waters and asking if we needed anything else very personable and funny guy too. We ordered the a pound of king crab extra spicy and my were those spicy. We also ordered 2 lbs of crawfish served with corn hot n juicy baby spice lol I love to enjoy my crawfish haha. By far the best experience I had with hot n juicy. Thanks guys will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Had a great Valentine's dinner. Thank you Max for being such an awesome server, really funny guy! I got the \"get your feet wet\" wich included 1 pound shimp, 1 pound crawfish, sausage and potatoes. Everything was on point, servers always checking up on us, and filling up our waters. Thank you Max for making the experience great!"}
{"text":"Food is OK (that's why it has 2 stars)  to this place if you half a day to eat and wait even on a non busy day . Mill avenue location has great service this one ... Not so much .. At all."}
{"text":"Initially the wait time for this place was very intimidating. It seems no matter what time you go you'll be waiting for at least a half hour. With that being said it was well worth the wait. Their house marinade is delicious on every entree item available. Wait staff was very friendly and quick to bring out everything we ordered."}
{"text":"This review is for the location closest to hwy 15.   The reason for 3 stars, their 'mild' was still very spicy that I could not enjoy the food as much as I wanted to.  And the crab (whole dungeness crab) that my friend ordered was not packed with meat.  It was if the middle cavity, which is the best part of the crab, had all the meat taken out.  Weird.   Otherwise, the shirmps were jumbo and sweet.  The service was spot on.  Our server Javier was very attentive given a busy Friday night.   Gloves were given to each table in case you didn't want to get your hands covered in sauce.  Crab crackers were also given at every table who ordered crab.  Free soda refills table side was given at the drop of the hat."}
{"text":"Never had crawfish before so I was excited to eat here because I love sea food. When I got my meal,that I shared with my family, wasn't too excited that their main dish was a tiny little creature that was difficult to get the meat out. I'm not even sure half of what I ate had any meat in it. It was also allot more messy than I wanted. Could have had more sausage and some of the other foods that came with it rather than overflowing the whole dish with barely meaty crawfish. Sausage was also very salty and not very good. I would only come back if I could get a dish without crawfish."}
{"text":"LOVE IT TOO!!  Friendly service, the place was packed to the gills. Wait was about 3o minutes, but it was worth it. We ordered the hot & juicy seasoning, and it was just perfect.  The crawfish were drenched in butter (not oil, like most other places it seems like,) and they sure piled on the garlic! Great stuff, sweet meat. Give it a visit."}
{"text":"Where do I start? Unprofessional/Rude staffs and management, the food takes forever to come, and the employees are not well trained.  Everything is unorganized causing a lot of confusion and issues. Employees look like they don't want to be there. Asking them for extra limes and they act like were asking for too much, you could tell on their face expression. UNREAL. Came in for 2 orders of 2 pounds of crawfish. After 15 minute, the first order came out and I ask where the other order. She said that it's coming. So I am sitting there waiting. 15 Minute goes by, the manager ask if we needed anything, I said were waiting for the other order. She said she was going to check on it. Another 15 minutes goes by, still nothing.  The original waitress came by and asks if we needed anything, and I said the same thing. I am pissed off at this point.  A different waitress came out of nowhere and tried to give us the bill before we even received the other order. LOL. Long story short, I wouldn't go here again or would recommend anyone. I would just drive to Tempe or go to Angry Crab. Heard Angry Crab have better customer service and the employees look happier."}
{"text":"So excited to hear HnJ opened a location in AZ! Of course we had to try it out! We've been to one in Vegas and it was good (sorry we still prefer BC, but we'll take what we can get in AZ). We've been going to Angry Crab in Mesa since it opened a few months ago to get our seafood fix but their crawfish are so tiny that it's just not worth it (however, their shrimp is fantastic though).   Okay, back to the HnJ review. We waited over an hour for a party of 5 on FRIDAY NIGHT. Another party waiting for a table even went and got Jack in the Box to snack during their wait, hilarious! So be prepared for a long wait because the place is not very big, plus they haven't even had their grand opening yet. I'm sure it'll get even busier so just know it's going to be a while to get a table.   Food was AWESOME! At our table we got crawfish, shrimp, clams, snow crab, corn, sausage, and fries. All of them HnJ style and a variety of mild, spicy, and extra spicy. Crawfish were nice and juicy as well as the shrimp. They don't serve headless shrimp so be aware if you aren't accustomed to shrimp with heads on them. Snow crab was decent but the clams were a disappointment. Definitely add sausage and corn though and you'll be wanting more.   Service was pretty bad but we kept an open mind that they had just opened so I'm sure they're still working out the kinks and trying to keep up with the crowd. The table next to us (that was seated after us) was greeted, waited on, and ordered before anyone even came to take our drink order. When a server finally asked if we'd been helped we put in our drink order and food order altogether. It took forever to get our drinks and all of the food. The food came out staggered so not everyone in our party had their food at the same time. The clams took forever to come out and we had to ask the server about them 5-6 times. Finally we were done eating everything else and I decided to just cancel the clams because we were ready to go... Well that's when the clams magically appeared. The clams were definitely not worth the wait.   Overall it was really tasty and we'll be back for sure. Hopefully the service will be more on point next time. Just make sure you don't have any other plans because it'll take a long time! Oh and it's really loud in there and mostly Asian diners.   Timeline:  7:05pm - Put in our name for table of 5, was told it'd be about 30-35min wait. (We walked over to Slickables for pre-dinner dessert to kill some time) 8:30pm - Seated at a table  10:05pm - Paid the check (we didn't sit around chatting or anything either, we pretty much ate and paid. It's because service was so slow and the clams took forever)."}
{"text":"Came here to give this place another shot since I had a really strong craving for some fresh crawfish.  My boyfriend and I decided to do a late lunch here and ordered 2 pounds of crawfish (one corn and one potato included with each 2 pound order) and 1 pound of shrimp hot and juicy style baby spice, along with a cup of rice, and our drinks.   First of all, here's a tip: if you usually get mild or some sort of spice anywhere else, I suggest you do baby spice. I ordered the mild here last time and it was comparable to medium elsewhere. The baby spice definitely has a kick to it.  The food came out pretty quick, which is awesome because I was starving! The crawfish was very fresh! The size definitely differs but you usually get a pretty average size crawfish. I personally like to order shrimp and crawfish at the same time so I feel like I'm eating more meat without putting so much work into peeling them open! The shrimp was a little overcooked, I know this because the shell kept sticking onto the meat which made it a tad more difficult to peel.   After we were done with our food, I actually ordered two more corns (in sauce of course) just because of how sweet and delicious they were. Definitely hit the spot.  My only downfall to my review is that they didn't offer to refill our drinks and we had to let the server know we would like a refill as we were paying for our check. In addition to that, no one really checked up on us and I felt like I didn't know which server was our designated server.   My suggestions would be to zone people out to ensure they are covering the guest in their zone with 100% customer service.   Hopefully the 4th times a charm!"}
{"text":"The was my first time coming here. The place did not disappoint. The hot and juicy sauce that they use is very tasty. If you're a first timer my advise is to wear a t shirt unless you don't care if you ruin a shirt. It can get messy since plates aren't given.  I would take half a star off if I could because the shrimp was over cooked but other than that it was great. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Being from Norcal and coming to a place like this, I can't help but compare it to Boiling Crab. I thought they were alright, not bad and not great either. I ordered the garlic sauce shrimp and it wasn't as flavorful as I would like it to be, but then again maybe I am just garlic obsessed and personally prefer a stronger garlic flavor on my shrimp. I did like how clean this place was, how empty it was for dinner, the staff was nice and patient, and they played good music - definitely a good environment to dine in."}
{"text":"Wow, great crawfish. It comes with a few potatoes and half a cob of corn. The corn tastes like spicy garlic buttery heaven. I opted for a bowl of rice to accompany the little critters, and ended up pouring Hot n Juicy sauce all over it, the sauce is so good!   They have good shrimp, too. Can't wait to come back to try some more of their seafood delicacies."}
{"text":"I went to the new location in closer to Valley View.  the food was great...but the service was HORRIBLE.  they served us crab with no crab crackers.  we were told that they simply ran out and were washing some but they NEVER came out.  One person in out party cut their had trying to crack the crab.  We called a manager over and she really didn't care at all.  the servers didn't care.  it was HORRIBLE!!! HOW CAN YOU SERVE CRAB WITH NO CRAB CRACKERS!!!! i WILL NEVER COME HERE AGAIN."}
{"text":"I think I overhyped this place, not only for myself, but for everyone else who came with me. What can I say? I heard great things about this place, but when it came down to tasting the food myself, the excitement suddenly stopped. I mean, the sauce was decent. However, my brothers complained that the sauce was too plain, and that their shrimp and crawfish were not drenched enough in sauce. Also, the sauce was surprisingly not as spicy as the server described it to be. I must say, I certainly did NOT like the sausages that I ordered. Worst sausages in my life. I seriously could not force it down for the life of me. It was also a no-go with the chicken nuggets for me. I recall cafeteria nuggets tasting better...   Service was a bit slow and unorganized. The place was pretty darn small too. Once the dinner rush started, many parties ended up huddled around the bathroom. Not very comfortable if you ask me.   I think I might try the newer Hot n Juicy the next time I'm in town. My brothers raved about the newer location being better than the kickin krab (my absolute fav) back at home. Unfortunately, I went with the overall statistics of THIS place and paid the price: cranky brothers and an unsatisfied stomach."}
{"text":"Gosh, what can I say, I love this place! Hot N Juicy sauce is a must! I only rated this experience as a 4/5 because the food wasn't as great as it was the other hundred times we've gone. It lacked sauce and was not mixed around as good as it normally is. Kind of disappointing, but overall, this place is usually delicious!"}
{"text":"I've been dying to try this place since I moved to Vegas late last year. It's a well known chain restaurant, basically the Boiling Crab of Vegas (if you're from California).   I was greeted and sat immediately by Edgar who also served me. It was a full house around 8-9 on a Wednesday evening, as expected so I guess I got pretty lucky. Service was as good as it could get considering how busy it was.   I ordered a pound of Shrimp, medium in spice in their signature Hot N' Juicy sauce with corn, potatoes, half a pound of sausage & Hawaiian bread. And a side order of their garlic butter sauce.   I was starving. The bread & side garlic butter sauce came out together first within minutes of sending my order in.  The Hawaiian Bread was soft, warm & fresh, it was delicious and so was the garlic sauce. I noticed the garlic was a little crunchier than most boil places, so that was new. I liked it.   The rest I my order came in a few minutes later. The Shrimp was a very good size and perfectly cooked. The sausage slices were a little small.. I didn't really care for them but to be fair I'm not a big fan of pork or sausage.   The famed Hot N' Juicy Sauce.  After all the hype, I'm gonna have to say I'd prefer the Garlic butter over it. Just a preference I guess.   The Breakdown:  They don't mix the sauces like Boiling Crab or other places, so it's either one or the signature HNJ sauce but you can always order them separately and mix them yourself. That's what I did.   Prices. Their M/K *Market Price for their seafood was a little up there but again the Shrimp was a good size and so was the other seafood I saw that came out.   Another waitress Neri who also closed me out was very friendly and had the brightest energy in the room. Service was fine overall. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Went for the first time here last month after hearing about it for years and seeing it on man v food. Went to the location on strip and luckily there was no wait on Saturday during dinner. The service was great and the food was yummy. We got the Cajun shrimp with rice and fries and beer. It was a lot of food for the two of us but def delicious"}
{"text":"Maybe I got too excited?   We don't have crawfish in NY, so I figured I could eat some in Vegas.. I thought it was alright.   I've def. had better in Tampa, FL...   But the service was great! and everything was def. fresh which is very important"}
{"text":"Food was delicious, my boyfriend and i had oysters, crawfish, shrimp,  calimari, and soft shell crab.  The hot and juicy sauce was soooo good.  The soft shell wasn't worth it, it was $13 for 4 tiny little balls. We waited a long time for the calimari and even longer for the potatoes.  Service was crappy :/ they apologized but it was still annoying."}
{"text":"So my previous review was of the other HNJ closer to Decatur and it was not good. I thought surely this other location (valley view) cant be as bad so my friend and I went here for dinner tonight and im sure glad we did. We arrived at 730 and were seated in about 5 minutes. The hostess was super cheerful and friendly and gave us bibs and a fresh roll of paper towels as she sat us. Our server came shortly after and asked for our drink orders and asked if we had ever been there before and we said no so they could explain how it works to my friend. Our server was very thorough she took the time to explain the different shellfish and the different seasonings. We decided on 1lb of shrimp each with the hot n juicy seasoning but hers extra spicy and mine just mild. I like spicy things but that mild gets my nose running! We also ordered corn sauasage and potato in our bags. And we got an order of cajun fries. Our fries came out within 8 minutes they were hot and golden and had a little kick to them...they were just perfect. 5 minutes later our shrimp came and we dug right in. Deeeeeelicious! My friend really enjoyed her meal and was happy i picked that spot for our dinner. The food was on point and the service was wonderful im so glad I went to this location because I will be coming back."}
{"text":"This is definitely my most favorite seafood restaurant in Las Vegas. When relatives come to town from the East Coast they have to have their seafood!! We have been here at least three timess in the last week. Eric N. is our favorite server...we come as a party of 8 just to see him. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Only tried their soft shell crab basket and HNJ sauce  Overall, it delivered but the batter was a bit salty. The sauce was of a thin consistency so it didn't really pair well with the cajun fries, and it only made the soft shell crab saltier. Would come back (if im in the area) to try the shrimp so I could better compare it with boiling crab."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday afternoon at about 1:00. It wasn't busy- we were seated right away. However, after 20 minutes we still had not been offered a drink, nor had anyone come to take our order. I'm not sure if the wait staff forgot about our table, but after the fourth or fifth waitress walked past us without a word, we decided to leave. I doubt that we will be returning."}
{"text":"(Edit to update review) We went back to this location last week to give this place another try. After my husband and I wrote our reviews, the manager wrote us back and gave my husband a discount on our next meal. We decided to just go and not tell anyone it was us. It was a busy night, with every seat taken and plenty of staff. Our waitress was really nice, prompt with our food, and even preemptive with our drinks. Most importantly, the food was really good. My husband. And I both got the (get your feet wet) bag filled with crawfish, shrimp, sausage and corn. It was perfectly flavored and spiced.   I think this totally fixed it with us in regards to Hot N Juicy. I'm not sure I would go back a day before a big holiday, like Thanksgiving, but I would definitely go back any other day. I'll also leave up my original post below:   I just moved back to Vegas after 20 years of service in the military. My mom highly suggested we go to Hot N Juicy because it was so worth it. We arrived to the restaurant at 5:40 p.m. on the night before Thanksgiving and were ignored for 10 min. It looked like there were only two servers working the partially empty restaurant and probably the cook who we didn't see. One of the staff members who was working behind the bar eventually asked who was next to the two people who came up after we did and said they had already ordered to go. She looked at us and I just told here we were just sitting here, jokingly. She didn't know what to say, but it would have been nice if she had greeted us. She then promptly told us that we were the last to be seated, because they were closing at 6 pm. My husband and I looked at the door which said they close at 10 pm and we were obviously confused. Also, there were no signs saying they were closing early, so I guess patrons are just supposed to automatically know? She didn't offer an explanation, so I asked if it was because it was the night before Thanksgiving. She said it was and told us to pick a seat, which would have been nice to say to us 10 min ago. My husband was already pissed and wanted to go elsewhere, but I figured I wanted to try it since my mom said it was so good. I'm just not sure she went to this particular restaurant since there are more than one in the valley. After another 10 minutes of being ignored (I've been to places with little staff and the ones with good customer experience will say something to you apologizing for the long wait) my husband and son, who were both complaining of being hungry, got up, took off their HnJ plastic bibs, and left. I was not happy, but I decided to confront the waitress. I told her that we didn't think they wanted to serve us, so we were leaving. She acted apologetic, but I explained that they ignored us for 10 min at the door and 10 at the table. They were obviously understaffed, but again, I've dined places that were understaffed, but still treated their customers like they appreciated their patronage. We ended up going next door to East Ocean Dim Sum and Seafood Restaurant. The lady/waitress/possibly owner greeted us as soon as we entered. I think the Hot N Juicy staff on Eastern could take some notes from next door. Another customer walked in after we did, and the HnJ waitress told them they were closed. If they continue their service that way, then, yes, I think her prediction will come true.  Edit: My husband, who reviewed before me, got a response very soon after he posted from the manager. She nicely offered him a discount and free drinks. I'm still waiting for an acknowledgement of my review, but maybe she assumed we were together? Not looking for a freebie by any means."}
{"text":"Great food today as usual. That's said... Service was an atrocity..have you ever experienced service so inept and with such bad attitude that it becomes entertainment????"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good, but our server Leila was what made our experience worth it, she was great and resourceful about the menu, because my husband and I did not know anything about the place and she was so helpful with the lobster. If you can get over the smell and the heads on the food, you'll love it!"}
{"text":"I wanted to avoid the overpriced Vegas strip restaurants during this most recent visit so I decided to check out some eateries off the beaten path.  I love crawfish and I'm a huge Boiling Crab and was very excited to check this place out, especially after all the positive reviews.  The ambiance was cool and laid back, and the staff was actually very helpful and accommodating.  The better half and I decided to each do 2 lbs of crawfish, both in the hot n juicy flavor but mine in medium spice and hers in spicy.  We also split a side of fried calamari.  The amount of food we ordered was actually dead on and the calamari added a nice contrast to the crawfish.  The crawfish, however, was just okay.  Perhaps my expectations were too high but as other reviewers have mentioned, there's something off about the flavor.  It was a bit bland, even though I could see tons of garlic on every single crawfish.  Dipping it in the lime w/salt, pepper and chili powder helped a little but the flavoring was still a bit lacking.  All in all, it was an okay meal.  Would I come back?  Probably not but it was a nice alternative to food on the strip."}
{"text":"Everytime we take a trip to Vegas, this is a place we always make a stop @. The food is Amazing!! The employees are always friendly, the service is fast except wait times on busy days. The food is messy, but it definately holds the flavor!! I highly recommend getting here around the time it opens and avoiding evenings around dinner time. I must say, a must eat place!!!!"}
{"text":"Being from New Orleans, I had high expectations and this placed delivered. Everything from the atmosphere, to our server Jasmine, and the flavor of the crawfish... spot on.   I had a group of coworkers who accompanied me for dinner and we could not stop talking about the impeccable service we received from Jasmine. Her recommendations were exactly what we wanted. It wasn't until later on that we had found out she was a newer employee. Great job training, guys!  I not only recommend coming here, I'll be back."}
{"text":"Love this place. This was my second time here and food was just as yummy as the first time I went. I had a pound of green mussels spicy and half a pound of shrimp spicy. They were the best I had in a long time. They are always very busy so I recommend going early we waited about 20 min for a table but I didn't mind because it's worth the wait and the staff are so friendly we had Eric as our server he was fantastic. The manager even came around to each table to see how our meal was. This place is a must go to when in vegas. Thanks to all the staff for a great time. 10/10"}
{"text":"I went to Hot N Juicy as part of a group of 10 for a bachelor party. Although the wait was about 40 minutes on a Friday night, they were able to accommodate us pretty easily. I have never been to a restaurant with this concept, but I thought it was great. The table ordered a little bit of everything; crawfish, shrimp, & crab. Everything was delicious but the king crab legs are fantastic. We were talking about the food for days after.  The wait staff were friendly and able to handle a rowdy bunch of guys. You may want to arrive by cab because I don't think there is much in the way of parking. To help offset the wait time check out Crown & Anchor bar across the street."}
{"text":"Compared with Boiling crab, it's a great location for great sauce and fresh seafoods. I ordered one pound of shrimp and snow crab leg. They are fresh and juicy, well-cooked. I'll give a try on another Hot N Juice location tomorrow. One minus is that the environment is not good. But it's not a problem, compared with my awful experience at Boiling Crab LV."}
{"text":"Just wow. If anyone has ever been to New Orleans and appreciates creole food, Hot N Juicy at Planet Hollywood is THE place to go if you're trying to get your Cajun seafood fix!   The etouffe here literally tastes like it was made straight from the bayou and served at your table. So flavorful and has a nice kick of spice... and I'm not really into spicy foods. But this is just the right amount. PS - if you don't know what etouffe is, it resembles a sort of gumbo-like dish. It's amazing.  The regular fried calamari was really good and comes with a side of marinara and lemons. We were hesitant to order the Cajun calamari because it's a little on the spicier side.  I was afraid that the pound of shrimp with a mixture of all sauces (aka it's called the Hot N Juicy sauce) with baby spice was going to be too spicy for me. But baby spice was great. My heart was happy. PS - there's different sauces you can choose from like garlic butter, lemon pepper, Cajun, etc. or you might as well throw them all together and savor the flavors."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Mudbugs, crawfish, crawdad, whatever you want to call them I love to eat them!  Another gem located way off the strip on Spring Mountain Rd which is asian food heaven from what I saw driving around.  The place was crowded which is always a good sign.  The crawfish was very fresh as I think we are nearing peak season.  Nice big juicy suckers with plenty of tail meat.  All crustaceans (crawfish, king/snow crab, dungeness crab, blue crab and shirmp) have a choice to be bathed with mild to extra spicy seasoning sauce.  The spice level is as stated.  No watering it down for the tourists.  When they mean spicy, it will be spicy.  Best to avoid the extra spicy unless you are participating in some food challenge or trying to show off.  Not really a first date kind of place but heck if you bring someone here you both should know what you are getting in to.  Parking is beyond tiny and likely you will need to park on the side street which is a little on the sketchy side.  The servers were all fun and eager to please with refills constantly coming."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere,  eat off the table... Crayfish was very good...other items,  fri ed shrimp and etouffee was very good along with spicy fries... Very reasonable prices"}
{"text":"I'm so glad they open around the area. Now we don't have to drive all the way to Tempe. Went there for the first time and it was an hour wait... But our service sucks for some reason that night. The girl sat us down and took our order after that she didn't assign a waiter/waitress to us so no one help us throughout our meal! We needed water and that couldn't even be filled...Although some girl started to come over and she was so friendly! I guess the place doesn't have bad service its probably because they are so busy that day. The manager seemed really nice and all!! (: The food was good and all but I think Mill ave is better...4 stars for the food!"}
{"text":"Very good seafood.  took my aunt and she was thrilled with the boiled shrip.  Our waitress Wanda was very nice and explained everything to my aunt.  Good dining experience."}
{"text":"We got an order of crawfish and an order of shrimp. We added corn on the cob with the mild hot n juicy sauce.  The sauce was delicious but the crawfish wasn't that juicy.  Would recommend getting the shrimp with Cajun fries. They gave us gloves to use and kept our hands relatively clean."}
{"text":"Me and the hubbs decided to  go here for an afternoon date. Place wasn't so busy and the waitress Danielle, was very nice. We ordered a lobster, a whole Dungeness crab, calamari for an appetizer and a couple of bowls of rice. It seemed like a lot at the time of ordering, but the food just wasn't filling.  I should of ordered shrimp or something else. The calamari was The only thing I really enjoyed. It was ALL squid, no peppers, and it was light and crispy.  The flavor we requested in the lobster and crab was plain, and the waitress explained that the water used to boil it is flavored with seasoning. The flavor was fine, with a hint of old bay seasoning-esque. The crab was a bit overcooked and the lobster was not as tender as I wanted.  For $90, I think this place is overpriced and not that great when it comes to the quality of the seafood. The waitress should of checked up on us more and they should consider hiring a cleaning crew for their bathrooms."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness!!!! Soooo good! I have been craving to return since my visit over month and half ago! Our waitress was very knowledgable. She never got annoyed with the thousand questions we had about the menu. Highly recommend this place. Everything is good, seriously"}
{"text":"Today was the worst service we've recieved here.  We usually are all hyped as our Sunday routine,  but wow highly disappointed.  Our server never came back,  I asked for our appetizers, that always come before the bag of food, to only be told by another waiters that appetizers comes whenever,  and not necessarily before the food , please!  After I asked to have appetizers removed they neglected us even more. Check time came and they still wanted to charge us for something were cancelled and never ate. The services was terrible! We will not be returning take our monkey elsewhere.  I will spare the word!!! -1star"}
{"text":"Love this place! Definitely best place to go to if you craving some crawfish. It is especially better when it is in season and crawfish is live. Had frozen crawfish before and it's pretty decent too."}
{"text":"This is an overdue review! There is usually a wait time, which was expected around dinner time. I ordered the shrimp and crawfish and loved the sauce and the crawfish was fresh! The spice level is a little off, so go for the spice level below the one you are use to because even the baby spice had a kick! Worth a trip here if you come to vegas for the strip."}
{"text":"Nothing beats Boiling Crab BUT I must say that this place has no waiting time and perfect for big parties. So, kudos for that. The shrimp is fairly large size. FRESH crawfish is definitely a MUST. We tried the frozen ones since they ran out of fresh ones and it didn't do justice. The cajun sauce medium was tough to handle.. Whenever we go here, it's always a hit or miss; always too hot. Also, the last time we went here, we got charged over $50 because of miscommunication with the servers. So, make sure that your tab is accurate or else, you will spend 30 minutes trying to figure it out with the main server. I think our server was new and granted that we had a big party, we were very patient with her."}
{"text":"So worth the trip to Vegas! I loved the hot n spicy mild seasoning, although mild it still has a kick that will keep ur mouth burning. Trust me get at least two pounds per person, and add a pound or two of the shrimp!! After having crawfish at hot n juicy, nothing else even compares. Bring it over to md pleaseeeeee!!!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely one of my favorite spots to eat seafood. My husband and I have drove across the country from California to arizona to New Orleans to Florida and not one place has as delicious shrimp in a bag like hot and juicy. Hot and juicy offers so many options and spice levels and seasonings to choose from. They also have fried shrimp and fries. make sure you get the Cajun fries. What ever you get you won't be disappointed, just make sure to have patience on the wait for a table as they are always busy."}
{"text":"Great food and decent service. The place can get PACKED at peak times. A 45 minute wait is not unheard of. I give this place a slightly higher preference then Boiling Crab. Butter and garlic seasoning is da bomb."}
{"text":"1st experience: I was introduced to this place by my aunt during our holiday trip to Vegas. It's always sooooooooooo much fun going with the fam. My friend joined me that year and agreed that Hot N Juicy was just that. Since we had a group of 10+ we ordered almost everything on the menu except for the crawfish and lobster. I probably ate my weight in shrimp and crab. The side dishes were a mere afterthought. I did enjoy the corn and rice. Come on, I had to have some rice with the proteins! 2nd experience: \"Dude, I think the guy at the front is hitting on you.\" Our waiter proceeds to act awfully friendly to my co-worker. We picked on him for the rest of the evening. It was cute! I was in town for a convention for work. My boss treated us to dinner here. I was so excited since I already knew what to expect. We all ordered our own crab and shared shrimp and sides. The Hot N Juicy special sauce all the way! I learned the ways of H&J. Last notes:  If you're in it to win it, go for the H&J special sauce mild. Medium to me seems too spicy, but that's just me.  I'm the type that can't handle Hot Cheetos....This place gets super crowded so it's best to try to get there before the dinner rush if you can."}
{"text":"Came in here for the 1st time! Omg, it was soooo good! Back for a 2nd time today. I do the hot n juicy spicy sauce with my shellfish over rice. BOMMMMB!"}
{"text":"By far my favorite place for a taste of savory seafood! To begin, for a party of 2 the wait was a bit longer than anticipated it took around 20-25 minutes. We arrived around 9:45 pm and at that time the place was very much alive and buzzing ( but of course... you're in VEGAS ! ) We sat on the benches along the wall waiting for our table and were given water to compensate for the wait ( how kind :) considering the heat from Vegas ).   TO THE FOOD!!  The two of us shared their \"Get Your Feet Wet\" a combination of 1/2 lb shrimp,1/2 lb crawfish, 2-3 red potatoes, andouille sausages, corn on the cob, and your choice of sauce/ level of heat.   First, the SHRIMP possibly the best cajun shrimp I have ever had. It's texture was so tender and non-mushy/ powdery unlike some other places I've been to. I'm no seafood fanatic, but the shell from the shrimp could easily be peeled and I know that when it's easy to peel it means its been cooked right!  Second, the CRAWFISH. I don't have much to say on this protein because for me there really isn't much in it already, all in all I have no complaints. Third, the RED POTATOES. Also cooked to my liking. It's firm, round shape was still intact as well as the skin. Not too dense, able to eat in bites and perfect balance for the sauce. Fourth, the ANDOUILLE SAUSAGES. Sliced into decent sizes so it's able to give off a smoky aroma and add flavor.  Fifth, the CORN ON THE COB. Also one of the best cob I've had. I'm not cob person, more of the kernels, but I decided to give it a try and was shocked! As I dug my teeth into it, the sweet juice from the individual kernels and the spicy heat from the cajun sauce immediately floods into my mouth. The sauce is embedded in between each kernel so with every bite you get the full taste of sweet and savory.  Sixth, the SAUCE/ HEAT. Trust the menu and your servers when they say it's Spicy, it reallyyy is SPICY they are NOT lying to you! I believe we chose the staple sauce Hot n Juicy, but for our spicy levels we did Medium in the bag and Hot on the side. The sauce truly compliments the entire the meal, it's not too over powering to the point that you can't taste the seafood, corn etc but it adds a nice kick & twist for your tastebuds.   Additional Tips: - don't wear fancy clothes, and if you do wear multiple bibs ( provided ) - not really for kids unless they just want fish and chips - get ready for some dirty hands and possibly forearms"}
{"text":"This place is good. Like any boil places very similar to kicken crab or boiling crab in California. Food comes out fast within about 10 mins. Prices are good and hours as well!!!"}
{"text":"So good, we had it twice in the 3 days we were in Vegas! Loving this new location on the strip in Planet Hollywood. We stayed at Aria, and it was a short walk! It's less busy. And service was fast and friendly. There's ample seating and even a second story loft so no wait!  We ordered an assortment of food both visits:  Seafood boils - shrimp, lobster, live crawfish, clams. All seasoned Hot & Juicy, Hot. Perfectly seasoned, garlic-y, and right amount of spice. Seafood was cooked perfectly, tender and sweet. Only complaint is that lobster comes  whole, and you have to work to get the meat.  Fried foods -  cajun fries, cajun calamari, corn fritters - fries and fritter were good, calamari was a bit salty, but not bad.  Mouth is watering just thinking about it again."}
{"text":"This is literally the greatest restaurant of ALL time! I discovered this place watching the show I should have starred in -Man vs. Food and literally dream of returning.  Good news - I am heading to Vegas in a week (well good news for me and bad news for shellfish)!  This place is located in a predominantly Asian part of town in a strip mall and has a certain amount of sketchy feel to it -that makes it taste better.  You sit down and basically choose what type of shell fish you want - crab, shrimp, clams, or, of course, crawfish.  Then you choose the sauce.  I can't more highly recommend their special sauce.  Finally, you choose spice level.  Let me first say that I eat ghost pepper spice all the time - i.e. I LOVE HEAT.  However, I would recommend no hotter than medium.  Not necessarily because it is too spicy, but because of the level of garlic and oil -this  is a stomach explosion waiting to happen.  Seriously, I love this place....LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!"}
{"text":"As soon as we walked through the door the customer service was no where to be found. There was about 5 parties in There and about 4 waiters\waitress and when we finally got shown to our table the waitress forgot to give us menus. We waited 10 Min and ask the waitress if we can get some menu where she replied \"I was just about to get that for you\" okay... Fast forwarding a bit we order our food and drinks and while parties that came in after us order, ate, and left we sat there for an hour or more waiting for our food and when we ask the waitress how much longer she replied our order must have gotten lost and it should be out soon. 20 min later it finally came out."}
{"text":"Servers were nice and friendly.  Place was packed for lunch on a Saturday.    Compared to other places, their sauce was okay (Hot n Juicy flavor).  Fried calamari wasn't that great, not worth 9.95.  Fries were a bit over spicy; felt the fries were more spicier than the crawfish medium spiciness.  Crawfish and shrimps were pretty decent size.    Parking is a pain since it's a small lot; there's street parking on the side."}
{"text":"Came here before the grand opening and everything was great! I think Greg was our server and he did a fabulous job. (The receipt had the wrong server name) My boyfriend had crawfish and I had fried shrimp. We shared corn fritters and cajun fries. You could taste how fresh the seafood was. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Mild Drool = the Perfect Medium! Great service and good beer selection. Quickly gonna be a regular!"}
{"text":"First Time at hot and juicy crawfish and we really enjoyed it. It's a neat atmosphere. As we sat down to eat we were given and plastic gloves and sat at a table covered with a white plastic wrap.  We ordered a pound of shrimp and ordered it with baby spicy,  which was still pretty spicy for us. Our order came to us in a plastic bag tied at the top the shrimp all the seasoning the corn and seasoned red potatoes were in the bag. There is no silverware and no plates you just open up your plastic bag and eat on the table. Pretty neat atmosphere and experience. Our server, Janjira, was fantastic she explain everything to us and even gave us sample crawfish to try first time. The food was fantastic if you don't mind getting messy. Definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"In my opinion, it is not as good as the Boiling Crab in Westminster, California.  But in Vegas, this fix will hold me over.   The garlic taste is there, but the popular \"Hot N Juicy\" seasoning just didn't have the kick I was hoping for.    Here's what I ordered:  Sausages: just ok Shrimp: pretty good Clams: pretty good Corn: wow, lots of spices Cajun fries: delicious Chicken wings: pretty good!  One thing I do like: they offer gloves for people who do not like to get their hands dirty (i.e. my husband). I personally think that getting your hands dirty is part of the experience. They also have lobster!!!  But I think I'll just wait to go to Orange County for my Cajun fix."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Delicious and messy. Fun night out and the prices are actual cheaper then expected living in the desert.  Would come again and the food was super quick to come out and the servers were really great to us. Loved the experience, makes the place really stand out from others!!"}
{"text":"Went into this place kind of skeptical but it ended up being really good. Food was good, server was good - didn't catch his name. I would recommend to friends"}
{"text":"Love this place! There's nothing like it and it's such a good time. We shared 3 lbs of shrimp, 1 lb of sausage, 1 lb of green mussels with sides of rice and corn (it fed 4 of us but we ate way too much!) The hot n juicy baby spice was perfect especially for sharing, be prepared to put your bib on because it's really messy but fun!"}
{"text":"Hot & Juicy they are the best craw fish I ever had, got to get a little dirty but that is the whole craw fish experience.   Great customer service they hot other items in the menu like clams, lobster,  blue crab & peal & eat shrimp to name some but the craw fish is my favorite.   There sauces are amazing you can't go wrong with the one you choose if you are a craw fish lover and happen to be by Las Vegas China town stop by hot and Juicy you will love it."}
{"text":"Deliciousness in a bag. My mom and I had shrimp, crawfish, and black mussels. We also had the corn potatoes and sausage added to the shrimp bags. Everything  was amazing and tasted great with the hot and juicy seasoning. Our servers were Michael and Jasmine who were really great especially michael. We will definitely be back soon. Price was decent for 5 lbs of seafood."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this place! Ordered crawfish with Lemmon pepper. In my opinion it's better than boiling crab!"}
{"text":"I loved the food here. My boyfriend & I ordered the king crab & shrimp, both of which were really good. I've been here once before, & I feel like the service has improved. My server's name was Joanne. I loved her! She was really friendly & made sure we were always content. I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I'm always craving for their fresh and tasty seafood. But they have one the worst services ever. We've been there a couple of times and every single time we had to leave the place without leaving tips since all the servers seem to be careless about customers and they always mess up the orders and checks and sometimes they don't even have guts to show up after wasting your time by their faults. Even though I really like their food, I won't go back there anymore.."}
{"text":"Been to: Boiling crab in OC Kickin crab in OC Angry crab in Mesa  I'll compare this to Angry crab because let's be honest we really can't compare food from Az to Cali.  Seasoning: in comparison to Angry Crab, it has more of a Cajun flavor. Less butter and garlic.  Spice level: it's ONE step higher in spicy level. For example: angry crabs 5 is a 4 at hot and spicy.  Sides- Sausage: angry crab = 4 large pieces for 75CENTS!! (Steal)  Hot and spicy = 6 small pieces for $2.75!! (Def not worth it)   Crawfish-  Angry crab: small Hot and juicy: prob double the size and juicier. (Def worth it)   Shrimp-  Same size.   Service-  I understand Hot and Juicy has been open for less than a month and they're still working out their kinks... But there's no reason every single employee needs to rotate every 5 minutes to ask if everything is okay.  Never asked us if we wanted lemons/limes and salt/pepper like most other places. Didn't offer to place the bibs on like other places as well (not that I need it but hey, it's a nice gesture) :)   I'm giving it 3 stars and hope to give it more once they figure out the kinks. Will def come back because the flavor is there. A bit pricier than most, but still worth going."}
{"text":"Yes had a great time I was inter in a crawdad crawfish whatever you would like to call it contest my first time to eat them I mean I ate them was a little kid but not quite like this we never had so many I had a whole pound to eat and I did not win but I had a great time that's fine something new something I plan on doing once in a while and the staff were so nice to me, and they were really busy there we got in right when before they got real busy so just FYI get there early."}
{"text":"I was in Vegas for Superbowl weekend and was craving crawfish so we decided to go right after the game. To everyone's surprise, it was super delicious!!!! My favorite is their lemon flavor. This is definitely on my list when im back in vegas!"}
{"text":"All the food was rich and spicy! While my husband is not a seafood eater, he filled up on all the teasers. The sausages were tasty. Our server Anthony was a rockstar and handling the patio all on his own with humor and awesomeness."}
{"text":"I absolutely love hot n juicy! Loud, fun environment and great food!! Only reason why I'm rating this place four stars, is because I find it a little too pricey."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Over priced. Mediocre at best. Luke warm calamari, no flavor on small wings. Small po boy. Not worth it at all."}
{"text":"Even though the service was great, as well as the ambiance -- the snow crab legs I was served in the hotNjuicy sauce was EXTREMELY salty. To the point where it was inedible. I told the waitress & the waitress brought her manager to speak with us. The manager and waitress were great about it & kindly took the crab off of our tab .. but considering I went in excited to eat crab & left without was disheartening. That was just MY experience. Salty crab, thumbs down. Service, thumbs up."}
{"text":"really really good! come visit if in vegas 2nd best cajun style seafood place ive been hard to get find a taxi back to the strip though but the food was worth it and the staff there are attentive the wait was not too bad also id def come back"}
{"text":"Food is good and not too expensive. The only thing is the wait sometimes but that's fine."}
{"text":"Man Vs. Food  Turnover is not that bad and I think its because its VEGAS.  People would just want to eat and hurry on out of there so that they can begin their night.  I felt like a dare devil and got the hot and juicy flavor-SPICY! Trust me- I can handle spicy food and from my past experience at Boiling Crab and other places, I thought I can handle it.  I pretty much did and went through the bag with about 5 shrimps left.  Remember to clean yourself before hitting the strip.  Brush your teeth too!  You don't want to smell like seafood while you're out there =)"}
{"text":"Ok, when my friends told me we were going to hot and juicy AND we were in Vegas, I couldn't help but think they wanted to go to a strip joint that served food!!!  Who would have known they had boiling seafood in Vegas?! With a pretty big Chinatown too.  Service was pretty awesome. We get gloves, ultd supply of towels, people who check up on us all the time, and the waitresses would stay and chitchat with us. Awesome. It seemed like genuine interaction too, which was appreciated."}
{"text":"After living on the MS Gulf Coast for 30 years and having the best Cajun food in New Orleans, my husband and I are always on the lookout for Cajun cuisine.  Prior to going to Las Vegas I Googled Cajun restaurants and found one that had great reviews.  While in Vegas I mentioned to someone the restaurant I found and going to try and was told to try Hot N Juicy Crawfish instead.   The aroma of the seafood made our mouths water walking in.  We waited 20 minutes or so for a table.  We ordered a combo dinner that included 1lb crawfish, 1lb shrimp, Andouille sausage, potatoes, and corn on the cob.  My husband likes heat so he chose the Hot N Juicy Special Seasoning and the Extra Spicy spice level.   We also ordered 1lb of shrimp with Louisiana Style seasoning and the Mild Spice level, which had a nice flavorful kick to it.  We also had another pound of shrimp with the Juicy Cajun Seasoning and the medium spice level which was flavorful but definitely hot. They serve everything in separate bags per the seasoning and spice level.  The tables are covered with a throw away plastic cover which is where the heads and shells are tossed.  We loved the atmosphere, food, and super friendly staff.  The only small negative thing to mention is that the shrimp were hard to peel and a few mushy which usually means the shrimp is not the freshest.  Didn't effect the taste though!  Happy to read they are opening one in the Planet Hollywood Casino on the strip.  We will definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"Get ready to get messy and sloppy (in a sober way).  Went here with a friend cause he was drunk and hungry. Yeah, I had to babysit.  Ordered 2 pounds of crawfish (so I can get corn and potato), mild spicy-ness and hot and juicy flavoring. Mmmm-mmmm-mmm! Delish.  Do expect to get your hands dirty. Use a spoon to scoop out some of that deliciousness of juice onto your crawfish (after peeled). But expect the service to be just okay. They forgot to get me my bucket of calamari.  For the price, it's aight. Kinda expensive but hey, it's still good. Why 3 stars? 1. they need to expand and 2. service needs to be good or better."}
{"text":"This is one of my new go to restaurants in Vegas now! Great food, great atmosphere, and great location! My hubby and I went here on date night because of a yelp review!!!! Glad we listened!!  it here!"}
{"text":"Best customer service I've ever had! I normally go to the Eastern location, but this time I tried this location and the service was exceptional! Thank you Juan and Loreal for your awesome customer service! Not only did my friend & I enjoy the delicious food, but the service was top notch --- even on a busy Friday night! Definitely will come back again!!!!"}
{"text":"Wonderfully fun. Had the shrimp and snow crab legs with rice. Excellently messy. Great flavors."}
{"text":"So here it is, HOT N Juicy Crawfish. I have heard alot of things about this place because I am from California, so I've tried boiling crab, kickin crab, crawdaddy, and alot of crawfish joint's in San Jose.. and this place does live it up to it's expectations.  I would say the atmosphere is very similar to to all the crawfish joint's. Shoutout to the guy who spilled a little water on my iPhone and was nice enough to apologize and give me an extra 15% off my bill. There sauce has a little bit of spice, I would reocmmend to try there Hot N Juicy Special with Medium spice. It's very good.. friendly customer service, the place is average big..  I would definitely come back again if i'm ever in vegas and craving some crawfish cause i can easily eat it in san jose!"}
{"text":"Great service and great food. Had a great server named Shelby assisting us and making sure all our needs were met and also a great manger, Bri making sure everything was good."}
{"text":"The best place to go for Cajun style seafood!!!! Shrimp and crawfish was really fresh and very flavorful!! I got the baby spice hot&juicy and my friend got the crawfish. It was the bomb!!! We also got some Cajun fries, potato fritters and of course the best crispy pork rinds in the City!!!!! Servers were very polite and fast!!! Will definitely go back again and refer this place to my friends and family!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!  Not a crawfish girl so I go for the snow crab.  Lots of seasonings to choose from but I love the Hot N Juicy option.  Be careful....when they say spicy they mean spicy.  They have all varieties of crab, clans, crawfish, lobster....you name it. If you're into shellfish and a messy good time this is the place.  They bring it out in bags and you dump it out and go to town.  One of my Vegas faves!"}
{"text":"Love that hot n juicy! Extra spicy doesn't mess around, and this is about as authentic to a real NoLa boil this side of the Rockies. Get in there and get messy! Don't forget to order some Hawaiian sweet rolls to run through all of that delicious sauce."}
{"text":"July 15th. I attended a girls night out with a group of my friends. The customer service was poor at best.  I've frequently visited this Hot N Juicy in the past and this is the worse service I've ever received . Usually the service is pretty good.    I received my order 50 min after I ordered it.  My order was incorrect when I finally received it.  The General Manager,  that was currently on the premises was rude, personally to me, when I went up to the cash register to pay my bill,  I asked her for the total as the bill had not been settled at the table,  she was the only one at the register at the time.  She yelled at me and told me that I was banned from this store,  at this point the manager of the store,  intervened,  and said that was not the case,  he wrote my name down.  He could clearly see I was not being rude or causing an altercation.  The General Manager escalated the issue with the rest of the group.  The rest of the staff was great,  they apologized for the lateness and incorrect orders of food."}
{"text":"They didn't have the live crawfish.  The frozen were a far cry.  The shrimp were delicious and overall I'll give it a three"}
{"text":"They have Lobster :) and the waitress helped get the meat out for us. We are never disappointed. King crab legs and crawfish are also great"}
{"text":"You can definitely smell that this place serves garlic, and lots of it.  I saw this place on the Travel channel and had to try it since I'm a fan of Boiling Crab in So. Cal.  The crawfish is good, but doesn't have a lot of meat, so instead I recommend that you opt for shrimp.  As for choice of sauce, I definitely recommend the Hot N' Juicy Special - almost as good as Boiling Crab.  The red potatoes and corn on the cob are good choices for add-ons and come right in the bag with the seafood smothered in sauce.   You WILL use your hands to eat, and you WILL get dirty and possibly reek of garlic for the next few days.  So this place is a definite no for a 1st or even 2nd and 3rd date (or the day before any date). As for price, the bill came out to around $60 for 2 people (shrimp, crab, sides and  2 ice cold beers). I give this place 3.7 stars."}
{"text":"Four of us dropped by for dinner on a Saturday night and were happy to find them not too busy. We were quickly seated and the servers were very prompt about providing us with beverages.  We started with a pound of black mussels and two pounds of shrimp in various sauces. After scarfing that down we ordered two more pounds of shrimp and an order of green mussels in various sauces. Along with the seafood we had some potatoes, sausages and rice.  It's super messy, but the food is delicious and the service is very good. They are exceedingly attentive. Eating here is a delicious and fun experience."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of seafood and mixed with spices and garlic just make Hot N Juicy my kind of restaurant. I was a bit of a doubter at first since I came from Southern CA and was used to Boiling Crab (which has since made its way to the Las Vegas valley). I have yet to try the LV Boiling Crab, but I am a fan of Hot N Juicy. The sauce is a bit different than Boiling Crab, but has a lot of flavor and you can definitely enjoy it. My usual order consists of shrimp and Alaskan king crab legs in the Hot N Juicy special sauce (which is basically all the sauces combined together - extra garlic please!) at the spicy level. Note - extra spicy is really really hot, almost too hot to be enjoyable.   I have also had their lobster tails and other crabs. I'm not a huge fan of crawfish since its a lot of work for a little meat, but a lot of other people enjoy it here. Be prepared for a messy meal as this is a eat with your hands kind of place since you have to peel most everything. Its usually fun to see who can make the biggest pile of shells!  I've also had the deep fried soft shell crab with fries and the oysters - both are really good and the oysters were fresh.   This is definitely a place that I will frequent and also bring friends to from out of town. I will see how the new LV Boiling Crab compares, but for now, you can find me at Hot N Juicy!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious, similar to boiling crab from California. If service was better this place would be 5 stars. 2 waiters in the restaurant and 2 tables of customers and not once did we get asked for refills, 1 hour later we had to ask. If they work on service this place is good."}
{"text":"Went to eat here for a friends birthday. The place was fun, service as fast and if you like seafood its has huge portions. Even the catfish was cooked perfectly. The only thing that sucked was that they didn't splite the checks correctly and we ended up over paying because they wouldn't fix it since we were a big party. Not a big place so make reservations."}
{"text":"Went here a few weeks ago on recommendation of a friend. It was really really good. My husband and I each orderd 2lb of crawfish which came with a small ear of corn and a red potato. I had the mild and it was just the right amount of spice for me, and i'm not really a fan of spicy food.  I did find that I was still hungry so I ordered some etouffe and oh man let me tell you that stuff is the business. It's kinda similar to a gumbo as it's a seafood soup served over rice. So if you're into crawfish or other seafood for that matter cooked in a spicy boil this place is for you!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Now I have never been to Louisiana or anywhere in the South, so I can't compare it to anything \"authentic\". But I really have to say this place is awesome. You have a mixture of different people eating and working there. It's an awesome casual place to hang out, watch sports, and most importantly enjoy some crawfish.  You really can't go wrong with the Hot n Juicy Special. It's packed with flavor. I really like spicy foods but when I ordered extra spicy, I really thought I needed a two liter with me to just get through the meal.  The only downside to the restaurant is the parking. There is absolutely no parking during the weekend at dinner time. If you happen to park in the massage parking spot for two seconds (I happened to be picking up a to go meal), this angry little Asian woman will come out screaming at you. So if you are coming for dinner, be prepared to park in the next plaza."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in several years and it will probably be another several years, if even. The service received this evening was dismal. Alexis was inattentive, she barely checked in with our table our drinks were empty and our food took forever to come out. The table of four was seated after us and served before us, even the party of eight was seated after us and served before us. Half of our party of four received their food while we continued to wait for ours we order shrimp and snow crab. Once they were finished with there food we recieved our 10 mins later snow crab then the shrimp five minutes later(we didn't get gloves, and the other table next to us asked for leg crackers for is). When we inquired about our food she explained that everything comes out when ready. I understand that but wouldn't it make more sense to make orders together so that they can all be served at the same time! What's the point of going to eat out if you have to watch the other person eat while you wait? Alexis should've explained this. Melody  (wears a sunflower pendent) took over while Alexis was on lunch and was extremely nice and accommodating. Maybe more servers need to be on staff so the severs aren't overwhelmed and can provide excellent service. There are other restaurants in town comparable to this one, you should make sure you stick out more than the rest."}
{"text":"I've been planning to visit Vegas with my family and did a little yelping before. After a long drive, I was really excited to try this place until they sneakily ripped us off. It was pretty late so we were just looking for a small snack for a decent price.  I specifically ordered 2 pounds frozen crawfish which was priced for $7.99 a pound. It should have come out to ~$16.00 pre tax, but when I got the bill, it was $25.00+. I asked the waitress about our bill, and she said that they ran out of frozen crawfish. I asked her if they're supposed to let their customers know that they ran out of something, and she said yes. Confused as to why she didn't tell us? Every crawfish place I go to tells their customers if they have run out of something. Aside from that, the crawfish was actually pretty good and the sauce was tasty.  I also ordered the fried catfish which was supposed to be $7.99 but we were charged $10.99. When we ordered, she asked what kind of fries we wanted, implying that the fries were included. I even asked if it was included? She didn't say anything... Other than that, the catfish and fries were good too, they came out hot which was nice.  The food was good but I was disappointed at their service. Didn't catch the name of the waitress, but  it's irrelevant because I won't be back. She didn't try at all to do anything about the situation. I'm tired of dishonest employees..."}
{"text":"A vegas must!! Love the food every time we go....we order the mussels, shrimp and crawdads...yummmmm! The cajun fries are delish and u can never fail with the hot n juicy seasoning!"}
{"text":"The food is so delicious at Hot N Juicy. I do not ever eat seafood or shellfish. We had the King crab and the shrimp and the crawfish.  All Items were served very hot and full of flavor. The flavors are amazing. Try the Hot N Juicy Spicy it might be the best flavor they have. The service was attentive and helpful.  This is a great place for a family night out or a date if you don't mind getting a little messy.  I cant wait to go back for more crab."}
{"text":"It was first time eating here. I had a work dinner with all my coworker. I love the environment and different style. Not you typical restaurant no plates! Flavor on shrimp and crawfish amazing. Going again soon! Customer service was excellent very happy and great workers!"}
{"text":"This place is an unmitigated disaster. We waited at the door for ten minutes despite four booths being open. Then we got seated by a hurried waitress proclaiming that \"we only have a table, will that be ok?\"  Curious since there are booths on either side of us...but ok.  The waiter started off great and took our order quickly. It was all downhill from there.  The other couple in our group does not like overly spicy food so ordered theirs \"mild\".  What came out of the kitchen was so hot it made me tear up, and I adore spicy food. I was lucky to even get that since it seemed that our server had forgotten to ring in my order.  I sat while everyone else at the table ate their dinners. We made many attempts to get our server's attention and finally did so after about 15 minutes.  We had to remind him twice to refill our drinks and had to argue about our order to prove to him that I was indeed missing my food.    Fifteen more minutes passed and still no sign of my crab legs, so we asked to speak to a manager.  To which we were told that the manager was fixing the soda machine.  So he sent a \"lead\" to our table.  She told us that there had been a mix up and that they would START making my crab legs now.  So the server had done nothing in the last 30 minutes to rectify this issue. By now, I was furious.  I didn't even want to eat the food that finally showed up.    I went to the seafood market the next night and bought clams, lobster, shrimp and crabs.  We had an old fashion seafood boil in our own house for less than HnJ and it was all delivered on time.  Save your money and get creative.  We had so much more fun making the seafood in the comfort of our own home!!"}
{"text":"Been here plenty of times before, but never left a review.    On this particular visit, we arrived 20 minutes before they opened and already there were people lining up at the door.  So we headed over to Starbucks to wake ourselves up and to kill some time before they opened at 11am.   We headed back and we were immediately seated.  We quickly looked over the menu and decided on our orders.  I always get a 1/2lb of shrimp, mild, with the 'Hot & Juicy' sauce.  Their sauce is a lot spicier than the crawfish joints in San Diego (Crab Hut).  I, personally, prefer Hot & Juicy over Crab Hut.  The sauce just tastes better!    I think next time I'll get the 'baby spice' level with my shrimp.  My lips were tingling after finishing my food, but I enjoyed every bite and it was worth it!  LOL  *** Tip:  Be sure to use the plastic bib they provide.  And if you don't want your hands smelling like your food, ask for gloves.  Also, if you wear contacts, I highly recommend wearing gloves and avoid removing/ touching your eyes after eating here.  You will feel a slight sting if you remove your contacts shortly after  (haha from personal experience).  And, finally, pre-cut some paper towels and fold them on your table so you can easily grab them when needed.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Actual visit would be more like 3.5  Our family is an avid Hot & Juicy visitor. We started going to the Henderson location because it was larger and didn't feel as congested as the other two locations, even though it is much farther.   The food like always is delicious!!!! Definite 5 stars. There were 10 of us and most of us got shrimp, different sauces and spice but were all very satisfied. We tried the new Cajun calamari, definite must try. It is just the right amount of spice. Oysters tasted fresh!   Unfortunately, the deduction of stars was for service. We waited for about 35 minutes for our food which wasn't too bad since they had told us they were a bit behind but one of the people with us didn't get thier order and after asking twice where it was (& everyone just saying I'll check)...another 20 min went by and his food finally came but was wrong! Additionally, we asked for another rice but they said it would be 30 min for rice (we said never mind). The server was apologetic but honestly she didn't even seem to know what was going on with our order.   It was a busy night so maybe that played a part, but overall the food is definitely worth coming back for!"}
{"text":"I was in there over my lunch hour. I ordered Cajun Calamari & Sweet Potato Fries thinking that should come out pretty quick. I was wrong. After I was seated & the waitress served my drink (promptly, I will add) it was 42 minutes before I saw her again. I asked why it was taking so long, and she couldn't give me an answer. She left & came back with my food about 10 minutes later. The sweet potato fries were pretty good, but the calamari was burnt & inedible. If you are looking for crappy food that's expensive & uses your lunch hour, this is the perfect place for you. As for me, there are way too many dependable lunch options around for me to come back to this one."}
{"text":"Of course we had to stop by the Hot n' Juicy when we come in town!  Restaurant looked kinda small but man! It was getting pretty packed by the time we got our food!  Server was really sweet.  Didn't take us long to get our food either. We ordered the crawfish extra spicy ( $11.99 lb )  Snow crab ( market price lb )  Lobster ( market price per lb )  Fried shrimp w/ fries ( $11? )  Oysters ( I honestly forgot the price ) Everything was honestly so flavorful. The fried shrimp had the batter that Georgians would use for their fish, which was really different but honestly so crunchy and delicious. The fries, omg I loved their fries. Nothing special about it, I just love fries! The snow crabs were very wet, just the way we like it. We asked for a side of butter but I think the waitress got confused and added butter to our flavoring I believe. But we ended up not needing the butter anyways because I ended up dipping in the bag.  The lobster, omg the lobster had so much meat. It was soooo good! Nothing compared to GA's seafood restaurants AT ALL. The oysters were very fresh and a pretty decent size. Pretty sure they were blue point oysters. Lastly, the crawfish. The flavor was there and all but for being live, it wasn't as big as a I hoped and it also kept breaking.  All and all I give this place a 4 stars for their amazing food!"}
{"text":"When my cousin took us there I was excited to eat some seafood. Me and my family loves to eat seafood. We had ordered the crab legs with garlic butter, shrimp with garlic butter and the craw fish with the hot n juicy sauce but mild. It was too delicious and spicy hot! I bet the hot was going to be very very spicy hot."}
{"text":"Don't rub your eyes after eating here.  That happened to a kid once, and he was cryin' all the way to Mama's house.  The food is pretty damn good.  It looks fresh, it tastes fresh, it comes in a plastic bag.  The bag is gonna be hot.  I was told that if you wear gloves, you're a noob.  Well, then, I'm a noob.  I like keeping my hands clean.  Everyone's pretty nice, and the service as a whole is pretty good.  It's kind of like a Hooters for seafood, not that I'm lookin'.  I'm just saying."}
{"text":"This place is the BOMB!  My family is from Louisiana, therefore I'm familiar with the way crawfish is supposed to taste.  This restaurant is by far the best place I've ever been outside my family's kitchen.   Warning: The Spicy Hot & Juicy seasoning is just that, SPICY!!! But so GOOD!!!"}
{"text":"Today our server was Megan. I have eaten here before and the service isn't as good as the other locations however today was the worst. To start off typically you are supposed to receive the drinks before you receive the food. Nope got out the fries which I ordered CAJUN and did not have seasoning. The waitress insisted they were seasoned well I guess my memory is shot because I order the Cajun fries all the time. I ordered a pound of shrimp which was not hit when I got it. Whatever I tried to eat it anyways and the most of them were mushy. Which means they were not made fresh. I sent them back after eating 3 and received a 20% off. Again the server insisted that it was just that \"typically they get like that\" I eat at hot n juicy (off of sprint mountain) multiple times a month and have never had that problem. I will take the trip to spring mountain next time. The service here is awful."}
{"text":"Ok. I have been to every claw fish place in Vegas already. The food in this place is really really.... Soso. Our host lady was very very nice but after that everything just start going down.. The claw fish was very very small and flavor was not there too. Service was slow.. Sorry to say but I like the oraginal hot and juicy way better then this one..."}
{"text":"Torn between a 3 star and 4 star. Loved the taste!!!! Soo good!! The price though? Eh.. You pay by the lb and by the lb includes the shell so you don't really get a whole lot of food for the price. The sausage where just small slices of sausage, not a whole sausage. But the sausage was amazing, clams amazing, the crab was sooo amazing. Crawfish where good, just little meat again for the price. The place has a way to go though... understand it's new so it didn't get to me to much. The beer selection offered on the menu wasn't all in stock in yet.. The staff isn't fully trained. Waited for about 10 min til someone asked us for our drink order, which I had to stare at the hostess to grab her attention for this to be acknowledge. Super friendly girl Danielle? After that we weren't sure who our server ever really was since there was a new one every time someone approached us. Brought us our crawfish first. 5 min later another server asked if we were good with all our food. We were like yeah just waiting for the rest which threw her off a little. The music is clearly connected to someone's iPhone lol you can hear the beep of an incoming text over the system.   Over all excellent taste, friendly untrained staff, prices aren't the best for college town mill ave, and they got a little fine tuning to go. Maybe this review might become a 4-5 some day."}
{"text":"Different from any other restaurant in Las Vegas. Had the hot and juicy crab legs, catfish huge shrimp and Cajun fries. Kind of on the spicy side. Place is small and the have two locations on Spring Mountain...Why? They need to upgrade to 1 bigger spot"}
{"text":"Hot n Juicy is one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas!  Food is always fantastic and service is great!  Camille was my server on 12/3 and was very attentive and very accommodating!   Hope she is my server everytime I come here!"}
{"text":"I went in on Thursday evening with a friend, since I was excited about the place... We got a bunch of food (a pound of crawfish, a pound of king crab, and a 1/2 pound of shrimp, with some extra sausage, potato and corn)... The service was HORRIBLE! I've never seen such a disorganized restaurant! We were sat outside, right by the door, where their 'hostess stand' was... We ordered drinks from one girl... Then she came back to check on us, but we hadn't decided yet... We decided, then had to wait about 5 minutes before another gal came out and took our order... Then about 5 minutes after that, another server came out and asked if we had put in our order... Ok, cool. One part of our food comes out, we start eating... then the next, which was crab legs, but no cracker for them... We got one of them (a different one, again) and asked them for one. They said that they were being washed and it would be just a minute (ok, cool... they should be back in a minute or two with them)... 5 minutes pass, and we ask another one for the crackers so we can eat the crab before it's cold and get the same story (being washed, be just a minute). I KNOW for a fact... it does not take that long to use the automatic washer or a 3 compartment sink to wash those damn things.... THIRD time to ask for them, SAME RESPONSE! Are you kidding me??? Finally we get it and then we get the last part of our meal, the shrimp... Then finally after that the cracker for the crab comes by... And yes, by then... it's luke warm. Considering that was the most expensive part of the meal (and only 2 crab legs for 24.99), I was unhappy... We got checked on, I think once after that... that's fine, I don't really like being pestered while I'm eating. Now, the check... We had to FIND someone to get us our check... then, once we gave the payment... We waited about 5 minutes, wondering where the change was... Then we asked someone, they asked someone else, and then that person came out and asked who we gave it to.... Ummm? You lost our money? Really.... Finally they come back with the change. Whew! We get up to leave and much quicker than anything that happened that night, the first gal that served us was out there grabbing the folder with tip... she OPENED it too look at the tip and scowled... now, that, my friends is UNPROFESSIONAL. We left $10 on a $50 bill... Had I been the one leaving the tip, it would have been less, but my friend is much nicer than me. Get your stuff together. Now food wise, delicious... Crawfish were a bit over cooked, but good nonetheless... We had those in the hot n juicy sauce, mild. King Crab, probably would have been better if we could have eaten it while it was actually hot... We had that in the Juicy Cajun, Spicy. The shrimp were in Garlic Butter, mild... That sauce was tasteless, it was watery, and not buttery at all. Very disappointed on that to say the least. The shrimp were cooked decently though and when dipped into the other sauces, at least got some better flavor."}
{"text":"As a Louisiana native, I love crawfish. So when I wanted to try out this place, I wasn't expecting some awesome crawfish in Las Vegas. When we got there, the place was packed and a crazy line out the door, so I thought it may have decent crawfish so I decided to wait 45 mins to get seated. Anyway, once we got in there, the menu confused me because there were a million different flavors of crawfish to choose from, which is unlike anything I've ever seen; the most flavor you usually choose from in the south is if you want them extra spicy or not. There were 3 of us, so we got a few pounds of crawfish to try out, of different flavors to start, we also got fried catfish, and an order of crab legs.     The crawfish were surprisingly pretty tasty! But the catfish didn't taste very good at all, and the crab legs were okay, but extremely overpriced and not for a good reason. Anyway, if I'm craving crawfish again in Vegas, and have time to wait for a seat, I'd go back but I'd only order the crawfish and nothing else."}
{"text":"My first time eating here. Carol and Maddie was so nice helping me out. (Injured guy from Hawaii) very friendly and professional staff. Price was good for the amount of servings. Would so recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"After seeing Adam Richman eating crawfish here on \"Man Vs Food\", I made sure this was a place I must visit while in Las Vegas.I feel kind of left out giving only 2 stars to this place, where there are mostly 5 star reviews for this place. Maybe my experience was a fluke?  I came here around 8pm, and waited for around 40 minutes for a table. There were a few tables that cleared up quickly, but the staff didn't clean it up immediately... so the 40 minute wait could have been more of a 25-30 minute wait. They also have a strong garlicky yummy smell in the air which made the wait felt worse.  Ordered 2lbs of shrimp, 2lbs of crawfish, 1 bag of king crab legs and some Cajun fries in their special spicy hot and juicy seasoning. I felt that their Cajun fries are over seasoned... Quite salty... Their shrimp was the best out of everything, but the shrimp was just okay. The crawfish wasn't juicy as their restaurant name would lead one to believe... Maybe it's not fresh that day??? The king crab legs felt rough and overcooked... and it was the blandest one of all...   The service here was not very good. My group had to flag waiters multiple times to get bibs, crackers, gloves, drinks, refills. I eventually gave up and just walked up to the register to ask for these items... The decor here really sucks too, very dim, simple, and at times looks quite questionable regarding sanitation... I will not be coming back. I personally love the boiling crab much more."}
{"text":"You know this place is bangin' when you're nose is drippin and you don't even know it. Yes it happens haha but doesnt mean it's ok. Please use napkins accordingly. Thanks.  On to the eats. I always order a pound of snow crab legs and lb of shraaaaamp drenched in a bag of hot n juicy serum at medium level.  I highly-highly recommend their corn, soggy to perfection. One is not enough I tell ya. I never finish the fries so lesson learned, pass- on the fries, hmm although it is tasty.   The wait to be seated might take a good 45 mins on a dinner weekend but on the upside, food is delivered promptly. Mmmm you can see me grasping for my crab cracker as the bags are brought over. I'm ready for this peeling party.  Atmosphere is bangin too. Servers are alright. When it's busy we're kinda left on our own which is fine, but we need drink refills stat. Where you at?  By the way, garlic breath for the entire next day for the win!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place.  Tasty seafood and seasonings.  I like spicy and the mild hot and juicy spice was plenty for me. And very tasty. Addictive actually.  The bibs are a necessity. The gloves were a little weird. (I grew up on the eastern shore where you dump steamed crabs on a newspaper lined picnic table and dig in)  Sweet tea was great.  Seafood delivered in steaming hot plastic bags  No utensils or plates - just food - messy food.  Service was great.  Loved the area surrounding this place.  Fun, fun, fun."}
{"text":"Great food.  Mild Hot n Juicy spice is the best.  The gloves are a little weird - but I come from the eastern shore where you dump steamed blue crabs on a picnic table and start crackin'.  You won't get a balanced meal here, (no salad ) but your meal will be a very tasty one! We usually get the combo that includes the shrimp, crawdads, sausage, potatoes and corn.  IT IS SOOOOO GOOD.  The service is always great too! Whenever we are in town, this is number 1 on my list of places to eat."}
{"text":"Shrimp and crawfish were good, but the Dungeness crab was way overcooked, it was so mushy."}
{"text":"Best service out of the three locations.  Super attentive! Got all orders and requests correct the first time. Food was great as always, particularly good here.  =)"}
{"text":"After four years of \"meaning to try\" Hot n Juicy, we stopped in for dinner tonight. Our server Eric was outstanding. He explained the menu and made some great suggestions. We had the Hot n Juicy shrimp, mild heat, and the garlic butter king crab. We also got some potatoes, rice, and because we are fatties- corn fritters. Everything was outstanding. The shrimp with the rice and the lemon rivaled anything I had from famous North Shore Oahu shrimp trucks. Fantastic service and food, and a fun experience. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I was very Hungary for Crab and shrimp  .It was very good  In fact excellent  .the sauce was one of a kind delicious  I WOULD RECOMMEND TO EVERY ONE .I ended up peeling my crab and shrimp with my fingers but that made it more fun .."}
{"text":"excellent place.. great food...like the taste..   lalala  lalala  lalalalala:  lalala"}
{"text":"Like seafood??? Fresh seafood with  mouthwatering flavors??!!! GO HERE!  Pick your seafood preference. They have it all, shrimp, crab, crawfish, clams, etc....  Pick your sauce. Lemon butter, garlic butter, hot n juicy special is amazing!!! Then your degree of spice...baby spice to hot. Be bold, be daring....  They also have additions such as Cajun fries, sausage, corn on cob, po boy sandwiches, calamari. There is tons to chose from if you love seafood or even if you don't.   There are a few locations, as for service at this particlar one. Its not horrible but could definitely use some work. We waited almost 10 minutes before even being greeted after walking in. There was no host and we could tell everyone was just running around. Once seated however our server was really nice and attentive.   I LOVE this place"}
{"text":"Food was great decent priced but well worth what you are Paying for. Took a few minutes to seat us because it was so busy but service was excellent and staff were very friendly and helpful even if you weren't their table."}
{"text":"A friend introduced me to this place when I came to visit Arizona. The food was very affordable for the amount. The seafood is seasoned so perfectly and everything is brought to your table as soon as it is done cooking (so its very hot). Also, the music is surprisingly great!! Not tacky and themed.   My only complaint is that our waiter didn't bring out our butter until we were done eating our snow crab legs and we were still charged for it. It was only an extra dollar but that stuck with me. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"We went here to check it out and it was good!! Was not the best crab boil I have had but it was not bad. The reason for 3 stars the service was a bit slow and took a while for us to get seated and we were the only ones in line."}
{"text":"Only been here for lunch so there's never a wait and always get a booth. Servers are very attentive.  Typically get 2 lbs shrimp in garlic butter or a medium hot n juicy with a dozen sausage and side order of rice. HNJ delivers a consistently good experience.  Perfect for watching football or any sport with all their TVs. Will be back on our next seafood craving!"}
{"text":"When I saw this on Travel channel, I knew that I must go there one day.  It was worth the wait and it was every bit as good as I imagined it would be.  I got the crawfish in the hot n juicy special sauce. It was hotter than I expected. But, it was delish. My lips were on fire all night after. But, one pound of dads don't go all that far. So, I got a pound of shrimp, too. This time I got the butter/garlic sauce. It was great also.  I can't wait to go back. Who is ready for a road trip ?"}
{"text":"Some of the best sea food I have had in a long time service was great and fast also the wait time to get a seat was fast the snow crab and shrimp and crayfish was excellent  good spice and good flavor  I would recommend this  place to everyone  thank u guys & girls at hot n juicy Aloha from maui Hawaii"}
{"text":"I give this place a 5 stars. To start, I'm from Seattle and here we have an abundance of crawfish joints. Even our buffet are filled with crawfish year round. So you see I'm very familiar with my crawfish. When I went to hot n juicy I expected a similar experience as I've had with any other Cajun crawfish place. But no. The sauce makes all the difference and there's is the best I've had by far. I would definitely come back here to eat if I'm ever in Arizona again.   If you cannot handle spicy very well I would recommend the mild hot n juicy sauce. It's the only one I've tried but I can guarantee satisfaction based off of experiences and taste comparison. It's a little spicier than expected but it still hit the spot! A pound of their clams in this sauce will send you home daydreaming about it the next day. Overall it's a definite must try for anyone in town or visiting town."}
{"text":"Very good!!  First time ever going and was really Impressed. Got the Drool and it was great!!!!"}
{"text":"Don't come here if you're expecting to watch a sports game that you're interested in watching cause they won't change the channel. 9 TVs in this place but they won't even change one!!!! Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Hot: YES (FYI: Medium was pretty Hot)  Juicy: YES :) Service: Very Good Style: Messy Yet Fun  Dress Code: Casual *Recommendations: Order the rice w/a side of Hot-N-Juicy special sauce. Open for Lunch & Dinner Hours: 7 Days; 12pm-10pm"}
{"text":"Everything was SO good! This was one of the first places I've ever ate since moving to Glendale. I was skeptical because I haven't really had good experiences with sea food in Arizona but my server Shelby assured me and my boyfriend that everything was delicious. It was one of the prettier days in Phoenix being that it wasn't over 100 degrees so we sat on the patio and it was gorgeous. I would definitely recommend it. I wasn't sure how to order so she explained everything with out making me feel dumb like some other places have. The food was so good and fresh, I had to let it cool down!! My boyfriend is a sever at Oregano's so I always compare service to his and she did great, I never had to ask for refills!  Overall my everything was amazing and I can easily say we will be coming back!!"}
{"text":"I always wanted to try crawfish \"lousiana stye\" with corn & potatoes. I ordered the 1lb. bag of crawfish hot & juicy style, medium-spiced. The sauce that they coat the crawfish in is to-die for. I liked it so much I dripped my cajun fries in it!  I highly recommend this place. I just wish they had one closer to me than Orange County. Luckily they are opening one soon in We-Ho. Which is just around the corner of my beau's place!"}
{"text":"I never prefer to come to this location.  I feel like the one off Decatur is more attentive and gets me what I need (gloves, salt pepper, etc) before I ask.  Today I came at a slower time.  They didnt put in the right sauce on my king crab.  My hungry monster was absolutely frustrated.  But my correct order came to the table pretty quickly after. Our server Loreal was charming and made us all laugh.  She made this visit better than any other time I've come to this location.  Food was great as always! Hot n juicy mild king crab, side of butter, squeeze of lime in my salt and pepper, with an order of rice."}
{"text":"I LOVE HNJ as I always have since the original location in Las Vegas many years ago. I came here with my fiance for the \"soft\" grand opening while visiting this dessert state as I call it. LOL. And I still prefer HNJ over BC.  Glad to see them expanding to other states, so others can experience the great taste of seafood. OH, and make sure to say hello to my favorite person who works there, Jesse Sanders!  Give him a big hug for me! ^^  This guy works his butt off!    Though, I am always skeptical of new locations because sometimes the flavors are not consistent as what I remember from the original spot.  They were pretty spot on for the most part.  It all comes down to the sauces.   All their sauces are really really good. By far, I like it much better than Boiling Crab (too buttery if you ask me) .....:/   But,  I felt the extra spicy HnJ sauce could be an little spicier.(hint hint ;))  The medium HnJ that I usually get was very good, and garlicky.    Food: What did we eat?...We had the king crab legs of course as it is my favorite, shrimp, and clams with the HnJ medium, and crawfish etouffee.  Very good and well cooked and seasoned.  This stew of yuminess and butteriness of a lot of crawfish and veggies over white rice is soooooo good!   Also, the raw oysters on the half shell were deliciously sweet and fresh! :)   Service: OK, so here is where I have to admit they do need some brushing up on.  Understand that opening up a new joint and mind you, this place gets PACKED and I am sure the servers had no idea of the kind madness this restaurant can bring, b/c of its POPULARITY, so give them a break if they messed up on your order. I do think they need to organize better on who is serving who and assign them to sections of the restaurant, so they know what designated area they are to service, and have them memorize tables and such. Only 1 or at most 2 servers should be assigned to a table, instead of having random servers b/c everyone gets confused. I am a high believer in service, as I am in the service industry myself, in other ways and customers should be a little more understanding on newbees b/c this place causes extremely HIGH traffic for a good reason-for the damn FOOD!  Service will definitely follow in place as time passes, and for those of you who bashed them on the food, let's be real...these guys are still in training and getting to know the product more and more each and every day.  Obviously, they are doing something right..b/c YOU are eating here, have already ate here, have thought of eating here, wish you were eating here, and wanting to eat here. So EFF the reviews and see for yourself why this company is EXPANDING. :) Yummy!!!  Definitely, one of my favorite grub and grind kinda place.  Love how they give you a bib to wear and they have gloves if you need. But, we always bring our own surgical gloves because they fit better on my tiny fingers. Xp And do not wear your finest threads as you may get sauce spashes on you and stink like garlic.  I don't even bring in my purse for that matter.  Otherwise, enjoy the silence while I grub."}
{"text":"Customer service was exceptional. Sweet potato fries came out cold the first time and the second time, the business! The corn fritters are the bomb. The calamari is not very good. The first time it came out over fried. The second time it was cooked appropriately but was bland. This is fine as the shrimp made everything better. Our server Draya put up with our shit and smiled the whole time. Kudos to Draya! You rock!"}
{"text":"Finally made it here and we will definitely be back. We had the Cajun Calamari, 1 lb of shrimp with potatoes and sausage in the Hot n Juicy sauce spicy, and 1lb Snow Crab legs in the garlic sauce. You really need to add the sausage to one of your orders. They were out of the Crawfish but the shrimp in my opinion was the best deal for the price."}
{"text":"The original one in Vegas. The food itself is amazing at any location, but I got to say the service is by far the best at this location.  From the greeting once we walk in to the warm have a great night....definitely surpasses all the other locations.."}
{"text":"Really tasty food. They let us in right before the closed and never gave us attitude about it. The shrimp and king crab was great."}
{"text":"As a going away dinner, a coworker chose this spot to eat, chill and be together before they head out. So, last week a reservation was made to hold a spot for 20 people. Then this morning I called to ensure we had an area for 20 and that we'd be there at 630pm. Whoever I spoke to said \"got it\". So here's my complaint.  I get here late because the parking area sucks. It's not their fault but the area where they're located is pretty popular. Next, as I walk into the restaurant the whole party is standing. Uhmmmm, why? Well because they don't take reservations. OH REALLY? So why did I call and make sure the reservation was set and you tell me it's all good? ERIC, DO NOT tell me who I spoke to because you clearly spoke out of your ass. I'm frustrated because how are we supposed to plan an event like this and your WHOLE STAFF failed to communicate to us that your facility does not do reservations. Not only did you set back our plans for the night but you looked like an idiot when you told me who I spoke to with your sass.  Next, \"the party of 20 has to sit 10 and 10 otherwise the wait is going to be longer\" WHY IN BABY JESUS WOULD I WANT MY PARTY TO SIT SEPARATELY?  I have a bad attitude as it is and he added to the fuel.   Eventually we sit down, everything went smooth after that. I wish I caught the name of our waiter because he was awesome and actually put me in a better mood.  I'm only giving one star because the staff failed to accommodate the needs of our party, the host was rude which put me in a bad mood and I personally like another restaurant that is extremely similar to this restaurant where people are more friendly."}
{"text":"My server, Crystal R, did an AWESOME job! I thought the food and beverage tasted fresh and food was prepared well. It's not very fancy, but if you crave Crawfish in the Phoenix West Valley it's a place to go. My Big issue is the majority of restaurants in this area offer a military discount due to the extremely close proximity to an Air Force Base. Bottom Line: Server is a 5, Management is a 1. Hence a 3."}
{"text":"The name says it all! It sure was hot and juicy!!! We had an order of: Fried Shrimps (battered was ok) Calamari (average) Louisiana style crawfish (dang that was hot for medium) Hot and Juicy shrimps (BOMB) Hot and Juicy Crawfish (flavors exploded in my mouth) Some sort of deep fried popcorn CORN (YUM)  Their crawfishies did not disappoint."}
{"text":"It's good. Spicy garlic deliciousness. Everything is fresh and service is friendly. My problem is that I STINK when I leave. My clothes, hair, and breath are just atrocious. If you can't go home to shower and and brush your teeth 10x then I suggest skipping it until you can."}
{"text":"Oh well. Had to test the water *one more time* and went back because the last experience was so good!   Terrible service. Not *once* did my water cup get filled the entire hour that we were there. All the waitstaff is running around frantically trying to turn-and-burn when this place is busy, and it's almost always busy. They seem hyper focused on clearing tables and seating new guests. What happens in between (table service) doesn't seem like a priority. Get ready to get up out of your seat if you actually need something. Like you're hailing a taxi!  This was my 25th or so visit to the HNJ chain of restaurants, and the first time ordering their black mussels. These black mussels are small, shrunken and the orange meat variety. The clams are much better, but unfortunately they were sold out of clams on this last visit. I would definitely not order these mussels again.  Call ahead to make sure they have the protein you want?  Taste note: the garlic in the Hot N Juicy sauce is plentiful, potent and on the rawer side so be prepared if you re-dip your shrimp after you peel..."}
{"text":"Much better. I have had a bad experience here in the past but I'm all about giving second chances and I'm so glad I did. Everything was on point. Quick, courteous service. Tasty, good sized portions. So glad that I came back because I've always loved the flavor so it really bums me out when I have a bad experience but nothing is forever...it, at least I hope"}
{"text":"Great place for something different. Our group ordered the sausage, corn, shrimp, crawfish, clams and po' boy sandwiches and they were all good. The shrimp was probably my favorite but everything was good. The hot and juicy (spicy) flavor was perfect although one person though it was too spicy. It's messy and you'll smell like seafood for a couple of hours but it's worth it.  We were also impressed by the service."}
{"text":"Ordered from uber eats while in vegas for Labor Day. Crawfish? In vegas? It sounded like a challenge to a native Texan with a French creole last name.   I called four times to ask different questions. The same young lady answered each time . She giggled the third and fourth time when I said \"hey, it's me again.\" God bless her. She was very helpful and knowledgeable.   We ordered shrimp and crawfish. At first I was disappointed.. but when I got deep into the bag I was delighted.  The flavoring was great and spicy enough that I had to take a break in between pounds.   My only complaint is that they don't seem to let the crawfish sit as long while preparing but this is the trade off for fast food type with numerous options to choose from.   I will def go again."}
{"text":"I called and attempted to place an order for pick up, I was immediately placed on hold. I understand that they may be busy and will probably come back in a few minutes, but I was completely wrong. I avoid going in just in case I get the same type of service people have been getting (see the reviews that were left). I've been on hold for a little bit more than 13minutes, I guess my business isn't welcomed here."}
{"text":"Been here numerous times, I was actually going to hot n juicy before they were ever on the travel channel.  And the food is good like all the other reviews says. The seafood is a good size and the flavors are wonderful.  Now my only gripe about this place is the service is terrible and seems to be getting worse. We usually go to boiling crab because we get such crappy service at hot n juicy now.   Went here tonight for dinner and our food came out promptly. And everything was ok but the server literally was inches away from our table and never bothered to ask if everything was ok. He did that a few times and I saw him looking at our table but he never said everything ok? My boyfriends beer was empty halfway through the meal and he didn't ask if he wanted another one, I wanted a water refill and he never came. The worst part is we finally put our napkins and bibs on the table indicating we were done and he just looked at us and then walked away to bus a table behind us. We clearly wanted the check. He then refilled my water but I was done eating already.   And I know he knew we were done but he never came with the check. We finally had to ask another server right in front of him for our tab. I guess because they know people will keep coming to this place so they don't care about service.   So I'm sure nothing will change and they will continue to hire servers who don't care about doing their job."}
{"text":"If you`re from SE Texas, MS or LA(that`s Louisiana) don`t wait your time or money here.   While the ambience inside is pretty good, the food is terrible in comparison to our region.  There were 7 in our party (3 of us from LA/Houston, 3 from CA and 1 from KY) The CA people loved it (except the one that was raised in FL).  We ordered some of everything on the menu, maybe the oysters on the half shell but so what ,,,they just shuck them but some lemon juice on them.  Seriously if you venture out SE-USA, keep your expectations low and you`ll love it just like the locals."}
{"text":"Man this place definitely lives up to its hype. The atmosphere is great and the food is amazing. The hot n juicy sauce it full of flavor.  I will definitely have to  go back when I return to Vegas. This place would have received a 5 star from me but the waitress helping my party kept dropping the ball. We repeatedly had remind her of things she was forgetting. Maybe because it was really busy that night. Idk. Other then that. I highly recommend it"}
{"text":"Our table looked like a grisly crime scene... Severed heads, legs strewn about and disturbing moans of satisfaction.  Usually when a drop cloth is put down on the table and everyone looks like a surgical team donned in plastic gloves and bibs most people would run from the forthcoming mafia hit, but at Hot n Juicy Crawfish this is a good sign that tasty things are about to happen.  To say we enjoyed our meal would be a serious understatement.   We ordered the shrimp & crawfish with Cajun fries on the side. Our server JanJira gave a very thorough explanation of the menu and made sure we understood the sauces and heat levels, especially since we ordered everything spicy hot & juicy with a side bowl of extra spicy hot & juicy sauce. We like it spicy bordering on a nuclear meltdown - JanJira assured us we would be satisfied.  The crustaceans came out in unassuming plastic bags keeping them stewing in the juicy spicy sauce.   The crawfish were fresh with succulent juice filled heads. If you've never had crawfish, don't expect much meat, just delicious flavor. To order them anything but spicy would be a shame.   Shrimp o' glorious shrimp how I love thee. The shrimp are amazing. Heads ON! Flavor ON! Peel and eat, the side of extra spicy sauce was a good call. Much of the sauce is lost when you peel the shrimp, so the thick side of sauce came in handy to lacquer them with more of the garlicky buttery chili love.  The Cajun fries are some of the best ever. The fries are glass crisp on the outside and steaming soft on the inside. We ordered another after we devoured the first. The fries are perfect to give your mouth a spice break when the heat starts creeping up.  About a half roll of paper towels later with our white plastic drop sheet looking like a crime scene it was time for the check.  JanJira is a fantastic waitress, very attentive and made sure we had a great meal stopping by our table several times throughout the meal for a quick chat.  Next time we will be taking on the crab and a double order of spicy shrimp!!!  Aloha!"}
{"text":"Okay, I'm going to start this off by saying I was waiting for guests and sat at the bar and it took a very very long time for someone to get me a drink while I waited. The music was a little too loud for my taste because I was trying to speak to my dinner guests. However, the atmosphere was hoppin', the waitresses were fun, the people sitting next to us were throwing much shade on us going to town on some shellfish. Hope they enjoyed their corn and french fries but the next group seemed to enjoy the atmosphere just as much and my colleagues did and my own company was amazing so I enjoyed my experience very much. Sooo I went at the request of work acquaintances and it's not the best place to get business done, however, if you want a few beers and to get messy and eat some bomb food, please go!"}
{"text":"Spicy wasn't as spicy. Crawfish was a good size but not as BIG as everyone said it would be! Their sauce is really good and tasteful! Clams were meaty. Shrimp was a little overcooked and hard to peel. Great service!"}
{"text":"I came in here with my mom the other day to grab dinner after spending the whole day packing up and moving my apartment.  We definitely came with a huge appetite! We ordered 2.5 pounds of Shrimp (Hot N Juicy flavoring with Medium Spice), 1 pound of Mussels (also the same flavoring and spice), and a side of rice to share.  I really enjoy how you can order half pounds at this spot.  Other competitive restaurants with the same concept really only let you order by the full pound.  And I also really like their seasoning.  It's more of a sauce coating that you can suck out of the meat.  Versus other locations have more of a sauce juice that the meat sits and marinates in, but the moment you grab a piece all the flavoring is still left in the bag and not on your meat. The service here is already great and they're very attentive as you dine.  Especially since there's so much spice going on throughout the meals, it's nice to have someone refilling your drinks so you're not sitting there dying with a burning mouth!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here for the first time today and it was so yummy! The seafood was sooo fresh and my server Loren was super cool and helped us decide on what to order."}
{"text":"Whenever we come here, we are usually never disappointed. The sauce is amazing. I wouldn't be eating seafood if their sauce wasn't included. The crab legs and live Louisiana crawfish are the best items on their list. The price is surprisingly not that bad either. We ordered a pound of shrimp and a pound of crawfish with a bowl of rice and paid 27 bucks. The crab and lobster are obviously more expensive but even then its worth it. Hot N Juicy medium sauce is the perfect heat and flavor. There are other sauces but Hot N Juicy sauce is a combination of all sauces and just has a much better flavor than competitors sauce such as Boiling Crab. Parking is a bit on the downside but they have 2 other locations in vegas with more leg room and car room if you prefer more space."}
{"text":"I was excited to try the Hot n Juicy Crawfish in Vegas and I'm so glad I finally got to. It was definitely worth it!  We came on a Sunday night and luckily there was no wait. My friends and I all ordered a lb of shrimp of our own with the hot n juicy sauce. Service was quick and friendly. Our order came out and soon after that, an order of rice was put on our table.. but none of us ordered rice? It turned out that it was their mistake so they gave us the rice portion free of charge. Granted that rice doesn't cost much, but hoorah for friendly service. The shrimp were large in size and the sauce was good. Not too salty or heavy and perfect in flavor. All three of us decided that this was better than Boiling Crab. Definitely worth the 15$ taxi ride there and back to the strip."}
{"text":"My must go to when I'm in Vegas! It's such a staple! The seafood comes in a bag on the table. Seafood is cooked to perfection & the flavors are tasty!!! They give you a bib, gloves and tons of napkins. We got 1lb of crawfish 1lb of shrimp and it came with corn, sausage & potatoes! Pricing isn't bad when you're splitting!   Note: they charge for extra sauce on the side!"}
{"text":"Another one of my favorite places to come when I go to Vegas the food is always on point if your a seafood lover I definitely recommend you coming here"}
{"text":"My favorite seafood place beside The Crab Hut in California. I always get the Snow Crab with mild and Cajun! It's always good!! I would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Shoutout to Anthony! I called to place an order over the phone and my reception was horrible; he was as polite as could be and never seemed annoyed by my horrible service. I called back, finished my order and he was also the person who greeted me in the restaurant. Anthony, you're the man. Way to be the example for great service and a wonderful demeanor! Food was great too."}
{"text":"4 stars because extra spicy wasnt spicy. This is my 4th location visit between AZ And Las Vegas. It just opened so i gotta say they have things to learn. They are training staff so be patient. The flavors were consistent with other locations but spice was lacking. We got 2lbs of shrimp one medium and one extra spicy, both hot n' juicy(its the only sauce to go with). 1/2 dozen sausage, it was good but can skip. One corn just for the craving but totally overcooked frozen piece of corn. Overall its a great place. I hate the crawfish is so tiny and for that reason i skip it. Try it you wont be disappointed if you like seafood. Ps - make sure they make it spicy if you like spicy food."}
{"text":"Wow this was as close to home( New Orleans ) as you can get here in Las Vegas. I will start by saying please don't let the location stop you from visiting this restaurant. I live in Henderson and do not go across town to often to eat. It is a simple family owned place that we need more of in this town. The food is simple to order its all by the pound. We ordered 2 pounds of shrimp (Our favorite), 2 pounds of crawfish (very good) both were mild with the hot and juicy special sauce. They tasted great but if you want more of the Louisiana taste get the 2ND sauce I think it is called Juicy Cajun. We also tried the fried soft shell crab with fries (oh so good), Oysters on the half shell(fresh and good size, from the gulf not salty but I think its because of the season), potato's, corn, and sausage (potato's and corn are a must have, the sausage was ok) and last we got the etouffee (this was ok my wife really liked it I thought it had to many bell peppers but thats just me). There is more on the menu but all I could try this visit. I will return for sure the food is really that good. I put $$$ for the price because I ordered more than we needed but you will spend 25 to 35 per person easy.Please visit this restaurant they are doing so much perfect. The service was very friendly. Thank you to everyone for your reviews. It was the reason I had to try it.  Went back for some live blue crab and everything was as good as the 1st time. The blue crab is now my favorite. The bread rolls also are a must have to eat with the sauce. I know this place is different but if you love seafood please give it a try."}
{"text":"So sad, so disappointed...   After raving about Hot n' Juicy to friends and family back home, I was so excited to come back and feast on the overly delectable shrimp/crawfish. My family decided to order to go since there was about 20 of us total and we didn't want to go to the restaurant. My aunt ordered about 200$ worth of shrimp/crawfish. When she got home I was ready! But to my dismay, the food was HORRIBLE. The shrimp was NOT fresh at all and fell apart when we peeled the skin off. It was like eating powder... the crawfish, I already knew that they weren't fresh and were frozen. But they were even better than the shrimp. I don't know what happened. It felt so surreal, I've been to Hot n Juicy on several occasions before and I was very pleased. The shrimp were always plump and juicy. The crawfish was good as well. The only thing that's good about this place is that the sauce was good.  I'm almost embarrassed to write this update because I told so many friends/family about this place. It was most of my family's first time experiencing cajun seafood and they were all dissatisfied. They didn't understand why I liked it so much. We had over half of our order left over. What a waste of money."}
{"text":"I've been to multiple locations for Hot N Juicy and to be honest this was the most disappointing location.  It was very small and located in a janky strip mall.  The service was a bit slacking , as we had to ask 3 different servers to please bring us the salt/pepper/lemon combo before we started to eat our meal.  We also had to ask for water refills, which I hate doing after working in a restaurant that focused highly on being attentive to all customers and anticipating their needs.  But of course, the food was amazing!  I am a creature of habit and ordered a pound of shrimp, Hot N Juicy style, with Medium spice.  We also added some corn and sausage into the mix.  And of course you cannot forget the cajun fries!"}
{"text":"Wow! I can't believe that it took me this long to finally try this place.  It has been a long time dream of mine to get down and dirty!   Hot n Juicy and lemon pepper shrimp at one pound each with a side of white rice. In addition to skin peeling, eating with my hands, sucking the juice out of the shrimp heads, licking the juice from running down your fingers, and drinking the juice from the bag after devouring the shrimps; while all were sitting in my tummy and with a side of beer was EPIC!!!!"}
{"text":"Good food and friendly staff! What more could you ask for?  This is a nice option if you're looking for cajun flavored seafood. They provide several seafood choices and different sauce/flavor options.  The blue crab is hard to eat, especially when they don't provide anything to open the hard shell with (unless you want to risk breaking your tooth chomping down on the shells).  The clams are okay. The taste can be overwhelming with the clams being drenched in the sauce. It was a little disappointing that there were several empty shells in the bag provided (even after scrapping the floor of the bag to see if the meat had fallen off).  I would recommend the shrimp! The sizes are big and tasty!  But overall, a messy but good eat!"}
{"text":"I prefer this location to the older/original only because there is less of a wait and more spacious. I also tend to be a little claustrophobic when I am eating.  I always have a go-to when coming here: Crawfish w/ The Hot & Juicy Special in HOT. Muy caliente. Be careful, Hot will get your sinuses running and that's only a level 3 (out of 4)- Trust me, I like my food spicy! Medium also has a kick to it.  I love that sauce, so much that I will usually order fries to use to soak up the excess. Corn is also delish slathered in that sauce. I also always ask for lemon, salt, pepper- must be an Asian thing.  Crawdaddies don't really fill me up so I will usually order some shrimp as well. They don't really seem to absorb the sauce as well though...  Everything served here is finger food and very casual. I caved in and started wearing the plastic bibs offered- can't risk staining my clothes. It's bad enough that the smell of garlic permeated anything that enters the premise. I literally have to wash the insides of my nose with soap when I get home or I will be smelling garlic for the next couple of days.  I also remember entering a contest and being a finalist in their 2012 calendar, I forgot what the perks were, but it would've been nice to  win and maybe get free crawfish out of it. lol"}
{"text":"I love me some Hot n' Juicy.  It's hard for me to say this is better than Boiling Crab, but I definitely think HnJ beats BC by a tad bit.  Their cajun sauce has a better kick and is a little more garlicky and spicy, which I like.  Get shrimp with the whole Hot n' Juicy cajun sauce and adjust according to your spice level.  Then prepare for a great meal.  They give you bibs and plastic gloves so as to not dirty yourself while you shamelessly devour into succulent shrimp and eat like you haven't eaten in days.  Wait time can be a bit long depending on how many people are in your party, but it's worth the wait and oh-so-delicious.  Come.  That is all."}
{"text":"We came here after watching the episode on Man V. Food....OMG!! It was soooooo good, we came here 2 times during our stay in Vegas!!! Definately coming back everytime I'm in Vegas!!!!"}
{"text":"This place was great ! The flavor is excellent. I came from California and I was hungry craving some crawfish like back home and this place was almost sooooo close to the taste . The service was good . And I really enjoyed it . I'll visit this place for sure once again when I come back ."}
{"text":"I gave this location another try based on the invitation of the management team, and thanks to that I'm so glad that I can come back here in the future. I came in with a friend for lunch, and we ordered 2lbs of crawfish with Hot N Juicy flavor (comes with corn), 2lbs of shrimps with garlic flavor, half dozen raw oysters, and a basket of sweet fries. The total bill was around $75 after tax. This time, the crawfish is so fresh and firm, and mixed with a decent amount of flavored powder. Sweet potato fries are still hot on the spot, but the raw oysters are small and not that fresh. However, I'm willing to give 5 stars at this moment because of the professional management and outstanding wait table service. Jasmine was my server, along with other hostess and waitor, who were very attentive at times and super friendly. I will not hesitate to come by anytimes now. Thanks for the hospitality."}
{"text":"I love this place! By far one of the best Cajun seafood broil spots. Definitely recommend their Hot N Juicy favor shrimps, I also got green mussels super juicy. Spice level was good not to spicy. When I decide to visit Las Vegas again, I will make sure to come back. Very Satisfied!"}
{"text":"This place is so cool! I have never been to Hot N Juicy or Boiling Crab, so it was definitely a different experience. We weren't greeted right away when we walked in, but it wasn't a big deal, plus the restaurant was packed and we barely had to wait because of our timing.  You aren't assigned a specific waiter/waitress.  Someone seats you/takes your order and basically if you need anything or want to order more, you flag down whoever is walking by.  This is both positive and negative; you never need anything until you realize no one is around, haha.  They have bibs and gloves available, but we didn't need the bibs, really.  I started my meal with gloves on, but they made it hard to peel the shrimp.  We ordered one pound of shrimp with medium hot-n-juicy and one pound with medium lemon pepper. We also ordered one order of Cajun fries.  Everything really is hot and juicy!  All of the prices for their seafood are based on the market price, so if you check out their menu online looking for prices, you won't find anything.  The cheapest seafood item was $10.99 (crawfish) and our shrimp cost $11.99/lb.    It was delicious and we will certainly return!  ***Beware if you have a sensitive stomach like me, you will be on the toilet shortly after. Take care to order spices according to what your body can handle!***"}
{"text":"Every time I come here they are always out of clams  it's best to call ahead to make sure what you're coming here for is available."}
{"text":"Always the best. Eating here makes you happy. And wheb theyvhave fresh crawfish it is truly juicy. Yummmy!!"}
{"text":"This is my go to place all the time. I seriously can't get enough of it lol. Only thing I don't like is that it's kind of a gamble with taste... There are days where it taste a bit water down with little seasoning... Most days the seasoning is perfect..."}
{"text":"First off, food is good.  Table of 5, we all ordered an assortment of crawfish, crab, mussels, and shrimp.  The shrimp here are probably the best you'll have in Az.  Seasoned well, great flavor.  Also, all pint beers are $3 (even for 4 Peaks beers!)  Why only 2 stars?  To say the service was disorganized is a compliment.  First off, when we were sat we told them we would have a party of 5.  The two of us who arrived first were led to a table and were asked if it was ok if they added a chair to the end of the small table we were led to. No, its not ok.  I don't want to be eating on top of each other.  Next, after our party arrived, we ordered some drinks.  Nothing was wrong other than we were asked by THREE other servers if we would like something to drink while our? waiter was getting us drinks.  Then, after looking at the menu, all crab, shrimp, mussels, etc. say \"Market Price\" for the price.  I get it, this is how most local seafood places work.  HOWEVER, the prices aren't posted anywhere in the restaurant.  When we asked one of the servers how we would go about finding this out, he said to just ask.  So you're telling me I need to ask the price of the 15+ items that say market price? What?  A chalkboard would be fine!  The Salt Cellar and Angry Crab seem to be able to handle this.  Also, god forbid you drink two drops out of your water because you will then be swarmed by three kids with water pitchers.  I get it, the food is spicy, but if my water is more than half full it doesn't need to be refilled.  Then, our server told us he was leaving for the night.  Ok, fine.  But after he left, nobody came and told us who our new server would be.  We had to ask.  Of course the first kid didn't divide up the check like we asked.  Let me be clear.  I'm not blaming the servers.  They are on a captain-less ship.  I highly doubt they were trained at all.  A manager is on duty, but what is he doing?  I won't return or recommend."}
{"text":"A Vegas staple! Everytime i'm in town it's a must. Grab a plastic bib, pick your seafood/ sauce (hot and juicy of course) and go to town! You wont be disappointed at all just thank me later!!!!"}
{"text":"You can't beat this place for seafood and value. Plus the hands on experience is one you will never forget. Try the crab legs! They're excellent!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome.    The best crawdads I have eaten since I left Louisiana 13 yrs ago.  This is my new favorite restaurant.  I am already planning my return.  I had my mud bugs the only way I know them, cajun and spicy.  I quickly popped and pinched my way through 3lbs of the little critters.  Maybe next visit I will go for 4lbs.    Be prepared to make a mess and wear the bib unless you want decorate your shirt.  Eating here was a blast."}
{"text":"Thank you to the manager of Hot N' Juicy in eastern. I had an awful experience the last time I was in there.... And decided to give it another shot tonight, after speaking to management. The waitress was so nice and so very personable! Everything was so pleasant and perfect (just like I know hot n juicy to be)."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat in Vegas! I love the Cajun - hot n juicy spicy seasoning. Highly recommend their Cajun fries and étouffée.   The wait can be a little overwhelming, it can be up to 45 minutes or more...and when it's hot, it's not so fun to wait outside for your table.  You do end up smelling like garlic afterward....so ladies leave your nice purses at home ;)   I wish they would give locals some perks, since I eat here so much! Literally...I would go 2-3 times a month."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place out since it opened. So when the opportunity presented itself I was all in. It was a Friday night around 8pm. The wait was close to 30 minutes. Which I didn't mind. This place was packed. My friend and I ordered almost everything on the menu. lol 2lbs hot n juicy crawfish, shrimp, crab and black mussels. It was all delicious. You definitely have to work for a little bit of crawfish. lol but I wasn't in any rush. The clean up is simple. Leave all shells on table and the waitress ties up the whole tablecloth and throws it. Oh boy did we make a mess. I do recommend using gloves when eating. And maybe trying a variety of sauces not only hot n juicy. My overall experience was pleasant."}
{"text":"So this is a duel review between Hot N Juicy and Smokin' Crawfish.  As you can tell by this review, I'm all in with Team Smokin'.  But isn't it true with life?  Do you want a Hot guy/gal, or do you want a Smokin' guy/gal?!   Told you so!  Time of Visit: Hot - Thursday night around 9pm Smokin' - Friday night around 9pm  Wait time: Hot - For eat in, there were 7 parties ahead of us so we decided to do take away. Smokin' - Lots of room; seated at a booth promptly.  Parking: Hot - small parking lot so we had to park in the dark residential alley akin to Freddie Krueger's neighborhood.  It was a bit scary and we ran for the car. Smokin'- plenty of room in the shopping center.  No sweating or running required.  Service: Hot - Given the wait time, decided to order to go at the to-go counter.  There were 3 staffers there, but no one acknowledged us for a solid 5 minutes.  We didn't even get a \"be with you a minute.\"  Ignored and they didn't care! Smokin' - cast and crew were very attentive... actually beyond attentive.  The tag team waiter and waitress were great, funny, and helpful.  Billy, I can tell you love your job since you are just fab at it.  Price for crawfish: Hot - $11.99/lb Smokin' - $11.99/lb  Quality of crawfish: Hot - tasted frozen and lots of cracked heads.  It's never a good thing to have a crack head.  Most of the crawfish were very small.  Size does matter when it comes to the crawfish. Smokin' - obviously live crawfish, lots of different sizes and heads were all in tact.  Meat had a nice chew.  The Gear Hot - bib and gloves (to go), you provide your own table cloth (I used the hotel laundry bags!) Smokin' - high end paper table cloth, bib and gloves  Poop sack: Hot - Not sure what these crawfish were swimming in, but the pooped sacks were very full of who knows what. Smokin' - Poop sacks not as heinous as Hot and actually most were pretty white as oppose to black.  Seasoning: Hot - Ordered the Hot N Juicy Special in mild.  It had great depth of flavors with different levels of seasoning.  Hot actually wins in this category. Smokin' - Ordered Smokin' Style in mild.  Flavors were good and garlicky, but just a notch below the layers at Hot.  However, my companion thinks Smokin' wins in this category also....  Sigh, I guess I'll have to come back again and again to taste test.  2nd Date Quality (the come-back factor): Hot - Not even if you treat me like a call girl and paid me. Smokin' - Anytime baby!  Atmosphere: Hot - Hurry up and eat so we can get someone else's a$$ in your chair. Smokin'- Take your time and talk to me.  Also, try to win a lobster from the claw machine while you are at it and Smokin' will even cook it for you."}
{"text":"I love the seasoning! Best in town compared to cravin crawfish and boiling crab. Love the food but dislike the service and management. They just seem everywhere and disorganized and not very attentive. If only the service was like boiling crab! That place is good too, but can't beat hnj seasoning!"}
{"text":"Never gets old. Hell, if adam richmond is gonna come here so will I!"}
{"text":"I decided to do something off the strip for a change and we found this hole in the wall type crawfish restaurant. It was the best crawfish i had outside Texas and Louisiana. The Decor is very simple and nothing to write home about and the sides were not quite as generous as in big D. I mean it came with few potatoes and corn and we had to order extra even though we ordered a few pounds of Crawfish, crabs, peeled shrimp and crab cakes.  The highlight of my day was when i had to put on the bib around my neck while i went to work with the Crawfish. we were given a roundtable and all the food was placed in the middle with a nylon table covering which made the clean up process a lot easier.  They had different grades of seasoning and spices for the Crawfish so you can specify how hot you want it.  I will definitely love to go back next time i am in Sin City and still up from gambling which never happens"}
{"text":"In Hawaii, you get shrimp trucks. In Vegas, you get Hot N Juicy Crawfish!  This place is amazing! You order a pound (or five) of whatever seafood you want in whatever sauce you want and they bring it to you in a plastic bag so you can get your hands dirty! Oh, and it gets messy (but don't worry, they have a bib for that).  This place is pretty packed and there's a wait, but it's worth it. There are many types of seafood to choose from (shrimp, crab, crawfish, etc) as well as seasonings and the level of spice you want. Hot N Juicy Special was the best. The price is relatively low, the shrimps were decently sized, and the service was excellent. If you don't want to get your fingers dirty, you can always ask for gloves (but where's the fun in that). Also, remember to add Cajun fries and a side of rice (if you're local like me)!  Since there's no place like this back home, I'm going to have to try replicating this in my kitchen. :)"}
{"text":"While visiting Las Vegas with the family, we had to stop by to visit this place. Having been on Man vs. Food (one of my fav shows), it has gotten much much more exposure. We've waited 40 mins.... I was very disappointed. My family was disappointed. I expected more. I've been to The Boiling Crab, and this place doesn't come close. Being charged $9.99/lb for the crawfish, they were disappointedly small. I thought the crawfish were brought in from Louisiana.  The sauce had great taste went really well with white rice. Presentation of the product was not what I expected.... The servers were in very casually clothing but the decor didn't go with the atmosphere. The atmosphere has a sports bar feel but the decor was a lil too formal for me. My husband was disappointed. After we left this place we were still hungry. Disappointingly hungry. Should of had Chinese food instead. This place is over rated."}
{"text":"First time here, the waitress was extremely helpful on showing us how to eat the crawfish as i have never ate them before.  We ordered the get your feet wet deal which came with sausage, crawfish and shrimp, it also came with 2 red potatoes and 2 corn both corn and potatoes have no taste.  I got the hot and juicy sauce which to me was spicy but i dont like spicy food at all so if you like spice it probably wont be a problem for you.  For my first time eating crawfish it was okay its an expensive fish for the amount of meat in the shell, the sausage tasted like a kielbasa sausage but a little tender and then shrimp well tasted like shrimp, just like what i ordered if you want to get your feet wet this is a good place to start!"}
{"text":"Always delicious because I just love seafood! No fresh crawfish now because it's the end of the season so I had the frozen ones which was not bad. Small but tasty. Also had some shrimp and clams. Clams were nice size. Their seasonings are the best. The only issue I have is at around $11-$13 per pound, the tab could be quite high if one must get their seafood fix more than once a week."}
{"text":"I love it I'm from California and this my first time at hot&juicy I used to love the boiling crabs, but now this place even better than boiling crabs. I will be back for this. Friendly and fast service. I stayed in las Vegas for 3 days and I went to hot&juicy 2 times already lol. Can't wait to come back to Las Vegas again. :)"}
{"text":"The food was great, our server endearing!  Why the hostess decided to tell management we were \"livid\" is beyond me.  We were blindsided when our server came to apologize, then angry when management REFUSED to come speak to us to assure our server was great!  Without letting us know our server was clocking out, while we were literally discussing ordering more food, a NEW server came to us with our check!  I guess you have to leave when your servers' shift ends?!  I tried to call and complain to a manager on duty a few days later, I asked if there was some place quiet they could step to in order to keep me from having to shout over the background noise...apparently, that's \"just the way it is\" according to Jessie, the manager I got.  Three words in, she was already asking me to repeat myself.  Screw it.  You didn't want to speak to me while I was there and you are incapable of hearing over the roar when I call on the phone.  TOTAL lack of professionalism!  The food was GREAT.  The server I was supposedly \"livid\" with was AWESOME...There are multiple locations...steer clear of this one!"}
{"text":"This place is great if you are craving a dose of seafood.  You can choose level of spiciness, seasoning.  There are different appetizers and side orders to add to your order.  I usually order the 1lb shrimp or crab depending.  I  order rice, corn and the biscuits to go with it. I also like that you can order half a pound if you don't think you can eat a whole pound .  I like just ordering my food and bringing it home to enjoy without rushing.  I was super happy when this  location opened up its closer to me and I don't have to drive all the way to the  spring mountain.  Prices are reasonable and service is always great and the place is clean.  A bib and napkins are needed for sure as this is an eat with your hands type of place."}
{"text":"I LOVE Hot N Juicy Crawfish!   I like trying new places and rarely go the same place twice, because I'd rather try something new. However, I have been to Hot N Juicy three or four times, which is a lot for me, and I will definitely be back many more times. It's sooo good!   When my wife and I go we usually get two pounds of crawfish and one pound of shrimp. We get one medium spiciness and two mild. (The medium's pretty hot and the mild is medium spiciness). We also get a basket of the soft shell crab which is delicious.   The shrimp and crawfish are messy as you have to peel your own and are laden in delicious sauce, so don't wear your Sunday best."}
{"text":"I saw on Yelp that Hot N Juicy was opening up a new location and that they would be having a special on crawfish on 6/11. So we decided to check it out as we're big fans of Hot N Juicy.  The food was almost as good as at the original. I'm down-grading to 4 because the spices didn't seem to be as on-point and we had to wait a very long time for shrimp 'cause they gave our order to the wrong table. We did get our crawfish and soft shell crab quickly though.  Minor complaints, but I'm pretty selective with my 5 stars."}
{"text":"Well I was so excited about visiting this place. I Nevermind had crawfish before and I had to try it!  First off... If you've never had crawfish before, you are missing absolutely nothing! That little tiny bit of meat is not worth the fight.  We ordered garlic butter lobster also which was good.  I had ordered a side of the hot n juicy special sauce to go with my rice, the sauce is good but waaay too oily. Especially since it looks more like spices and less like oil on the man vs food episode.   Umm the waitress was beyond helpful, hopefully she'll be there if I go back.  It's worth another try because I didn't hate it, but I was totally unimpressed."}
{"text":"I loved Hot N Juicy!! Let me tell you I had been craving crawfish and after reading all the good reviews on this place, I had to go check it out. I haven't had crawfish in like 20 years when I lived in Mississippi and I totally forgot how to even crack one open. So as soon as I got there I was ready to order some yummy crawfish. I chose the 2lb bag seasoned in garlic sauce with mild spiciness. Oh it was so good. My hands got so messy, but it was all worth it. The atmosphere of the restaurant was nice, very open and spacious. It was not busy at all and the servers were polite and friendly as well. I would definitely go back to satisfy my crawfish cravings:)"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times I had a pretty good experience. I've tried just about everything on the menu and  the crab with lemon/ garlic is AMAZING. If you like spicy food then you'll love this place, because when they say spicy they mean it, we ordered two pounds of spicy shrimp and I could barely eat one without needing to chase it with a cup of water. If you don't like the burn, stick with mild. My boyfriend also got sauce in his eye... if your tongue is on fire from a bite imagine that same intensity in your eye. not pretty. I'm a big fan of rice so I always order it as a side with corn. I would say this place is comparable to the Angry Crab  and by far better than Joe's Crab Shack. Why I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5: 1.The service both times I've been has been okay, I just hate chasing my waitress around for water especially when your mouth is on fire...but I've been a waitress and I know how it can be. 2. I know the whole concept is to eat with your hands and that's fine, my boyfriend doesn't mind it BUT I do lol. I just hate the idea of tons of hot sauce and butter getting all over my hands and under my nails. Luckily for me they provide gloves. to eat with."}
{"text":"Yummy traditional Cajun food, amazing rich taste! Came here randomly after seeing a suggestion on yelp while in the area and glad I did. Very nice customer service, clean interior, great quality food. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone who enjoys Cajun food. Very good find, will definitely return soon!"}
{"text":"Crawfish were very small. The rest rooms were not clean and the food was just ok. Not impressed."}
{"text":"The service was excellent. One of the waiters even ran outside to find us because he thought we left our food. The food was good and seasoned very well. The fish was fried golden brown and just right. There is actually 2 of them on Spring Mountain so go to the one that's in the white building."}
{"text":"Great set up for a restaurant. TVs, music, but no seasoning on the food. Sad face. If you don't get it spicy it comes bland. I won't frequent this place again. On a good note, my server Michael was fantastic!"}
{"text":"I returned to HNJ at the owner's invitation to give them another try; she explained that she's been doing some research in improving the quality of their shrimp.. I have to say that the shrimps are definitely sweeter than I ever remember them, even from way before. Yum yum yum, rock on :D  I also appreciate her thoughtful efforts in pleasing her customers, a rare quality to be seen these days in restaurant owners. I don't live in the area anymore, so I won't be visiting often, however, I took my mom with me on the recent visit and made a big fan out of her. She can't eat the shrimp because of her low sodium diet, but loved the taste and is excited to use HNJ to cater her next house party :)  P.S. The Cajun Fries are way spicier than I remember, I'm not sure if it's my memory or not, but I think I'll get plain ones next time. The House sauce is still deliciously tangy as always!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Best food around and great service! Fried cat fish and Cajun fries all day! #cajun #bosslife #bestiewesties #hotnjuicy #highridinrarris #jessebestwaitresseva #longhairdontcare #nomakeup"}
{"text":"Friends in town wanted seafood.  Heard so much about this spot.  Food was only ok for me, but my family loved it, even though they couldn't get the shrimp them right away.  We noticed that most people had their food before is that came after we did.  This is a lot work.  My fried shrimp had WAY too much batter on them, I asked for 10, got 5 and waitress we nice and took off bill.  Shrimp did not look like the picture.  Disappointed."}
{"text":"This place continues to be great for me. Keep bringing me the Hot N' Juicy crab legs!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! The service is a hit or miss but the food is delish!!!!  Love the peel and eat shrimp with the hot and juicy sauce! I usually order it with steamed rice. The rice is kinda dry but them shrimp are super juicy! I've ordered the crawfish but just so much work for a little piece of meat! Lol. I've had their crab also but the best deal is the shrimp!  My son likes their rolls.  They also serve beer which is great with that spicy shrimp!"}
{"text":"Yummy seafood-king crab and shrimp. Mediocre service made for an underwhelming experience. Waiter was forgetful and inattentive. Had to ask four times for a side, three times for a check. Recommend for food , not service and hopefully he was just having a bad day."}
{"text":"First came here with my nephew and I was surprised that this place was really packed. I get a good vibe when there is lots of people in a restaurant. Because you know already the food is good. So let it be, when your visiting Vegas. Come by and see what I mean."}
{"text":"Update: I called manager after they sent me a message to call them in concerns about the food poisoning I experienced. So i called and left a message on the managers personal cell phone. Never got a call back or received a follow up, shows the level of how the business is being operated at \"Poor\"! Hot and juicy isn't the only place serving this type of cuisine. Again Stay Away!"}
{"text":"This place is a total mess, the employees need to be more trained. I gave them not a second but third chance to see if they got it together, but it just seems to get worse each time i go eat. The crawfish is just small and tastes like they are not fresh. Even the ones at buffet taste better. This is ridiculous!"}
{"text":"I was here Friday 09/23/2016 with my cousin. It has been awhile since I've been here and the place was great as usual. Our culinary advisor, Valentina, was awesome. Her knowledge of the menu was on point. It was great to see Maddie again, I can't believe she still remembered my cousin and I, it's probably because of the weird 'cola-viezen' I always order. The manager on duty, Maggie, even stopped by to see how we were doing. The two lobsters amazing and pound of shrimp/sausage also amazing. We were seated quickly and food came out quickly, a match made in heaven. Keep up the great work."}
{"text":"It was a disgustingly perfect experience. Extra points for making the crawfish nuclear hot!!"}
{"text":"We always get the shrimps with garlic butter (spicy). The clams were very good too. The catfish does not have a lot of meat (Mostly batter) and that sucks. Not must of a crawfish fan but love me some clams and shrimps."}
{"text":"I'm being very generous right now with a 2 star rating and this is only because it was only 10 days since they opened this location so I'm giving them the benefit.  There service was very unorganized.  It seemed that the staff was running around with there head cut off.   Let's start with drinks.  They failed to refill my drinks numerous times.  There were a few people responsible to refill drinks throughout the entire restaurant and they had no clue who to service.  The food.  The Pro: tasted the same as the other locations.  The Con: they messed up my order.  Forgot to add my sausage and corn.  In one of my bags they put the wrong spice and mix.  Overall I had to wait at least 15 mins for them to fix the order.  Our waitress couldn't handle the tables she was assigned to.  She was a nice lady but she was very flustered and couldn't handle the pressure.    This location is very nice compared to the rest.  They invested a good amount of money to make it look that way.  There were many TV's all around so it was great to catch the game during dinner.  I will definitely give them another shot after a month to see if they have improved there service.  My suggestion:  perhaps they need to have all the employees play Diner Dash so they understand how to improve there flow lol"}
{"text":"Again, another great off strip foodie find.  I dined here on 9/4/11 with my hubby and his brother and cousins.  We got here around 8:45PM and this place was jammed packed with people inside the restaurant and people waiting outside the restaurant.  We had to wait a good 30-45 minutes before we were actually seated.  Staff awesome and helpful.  While we were waiting outside in the desert heat, the hostess came out and served us all ice waters, which was a really nice gesture knowing that it was hot and we were all waiting patiently for a table.    OMG, food here is fantastic!!  Everyone in my party loved the crawfish and shrimp.  We ordered both crawfish and shrimp in their Hot N Juicy Special seasoning.  It was amazing!!!!!  We also ordered crawfish and shrimp in their garlic butter sauce.  So good!!!!  My brother in law said that this place was way better than Boiling Crab and had better prices too!    They had really delicious Cajun fries and their catfish and chicken wings are very tasty goodie too!  The Cajun fries were spicy and can sneak up on you!  :)   TIP:  Parking is limited, you may need to park on the street.  Try to get there as early as possible as this place gets crazy busy!!!!"}
{"text":"Looking for some crawfish?  Like it Hot?  Like it Juicy?  Well Holy Apple Jack's Batman I found it!  Something I didn't expect, but oh what a pleasant surprise.  Tables are covered with plastic and a roll of paper towel is your complimentary item, which you'll need.  This place is all about the food, from the time you eat til the time you leave the smell of garlic and spices will linger.  The spicy is really really spicy!         Your tools left hand/Right hand.  The object?  To Eat.      For 3 people: Medium 1lb of Shrimp 2 lbs of Crawfish Corn + Potato + Beverage  Oh so tasty.  Decor:4 Food:4 Service:4  Would I go back?  You bet your pastrami I would!"}
{"text":"Delicious food! It's so rare that I find a place that actually makes spicy food to my standard. If I order the hottest thing on the menu, I need to be sweating and breathing hard. Exactly what I'm looking for in my food.  Amazing service! All the servers are so personable and are great conversationalists. You can tell they are all passionate and dedicated to giving the best service.  Would give 6 stars if possible."}
{"text":"I have dined here many times before but was disappointed today when I brought my 5 year old son in for some snow crab and king crab. Because I was dining with a child I ordered the mild garlic butter seasoning. The sauce was nothing close to mild and almost too spicy for me to enjoy.  I asked why it was a red color (garlic and butter are not red) and the server wouldn't tell me specifics and just said it was a Cajun spice blend. I didn't order the cajon seasoning flavor and from the menu choices, I chose garlic butter thinking that's all it would be. The seasonings should be explained better on the menu."}
{"text":"The customer service here is awful and unacceptable!!! After being seated none of the servers catered to our needs and they were extremely rude. We watched them go back and forth to the tables around us, but they never checked on us to make sure we were doing fine. We had to walk to the front of the restaurant to get our own check, because no one bothered to bring it to us, which is a part of a servers job. When we expressed our experience to the server, by the name of Taryn, we were only offered a \"I'm sorry\". We were the only African American individuals in the restaurant, which is probably why were treated like such. I will never spend a dime at this establishment in the future."}
{"text":"I love hot n juicy. My husband and I usually get corn, a pound of shrimp and crawfish in the extra spicy Hot N Juicy Special sauce, and are stuffed by the end of the meal. The sauce is extremely flavorful and loaded with chopped garlic. The shrimp and crawfish are of nice size and fresh. They sell bowls of their incredible sauce mixture, which I loved taking home and incorporating into rice dishes."}
{"text":"As good as advertised but the only thing bad is just the lines and waiting because everyone that visit Vegas has to come by here to eat it at least once so there's always a wait. But it's def worth it"}
{"text":"Another great HnJ location.  This was our first time there.  We have been to the Fountain Valley and also the other Vegas location.  This location is huge with plenty of seating and good for large groups.  The service was EXCELLENT!!!  Aubrey rocked her server job!!  The food came out very fast and was nice and hot.  The spice was perfect in all of our orders.  We had crawfish, shrimp, rolls and corn fritters.  Oh and hubby had some sausage.    The kids LOVE HnJ and love getting messy.  Be prepared to spend about $20 or more per person but it is a lot of fun and really delicious."}
{"text":"A very enjoyable experience. Tonight I went with modest expectations after watching Adam Richmond eat here on Man v. Food. The experience was great. I met a few locals who said they eat their once a week, and started eating there before it was on tv. They suggested several dishes: the hot n juicy, medium spice, crawfish and sausage; the lemon pepper medium spice shrimp, and the mild spice lemon pepper crab legs. Everything was very enjoyable. The prices were very reasonable too. The waiters/waitress were very attentive, and the owner even gave us quite a bit of face time. I come to Vegas yearly, and this will be a normal stop for me."}
{"text":"I came here all the way from Denver they were very quick, very professional staff. Randy was my server and his services were excellent. They need a Hot N Juicy in den ver!!!"}
{"text":"Yum! Don't wear your Sunday finest- things can get messy here. Shellfish in a baggie of spicy broth- simple yet delicious. The crawfish is fresh and, if you prefer, the king crab is well worth the price. A little taste of N'Awlins off the strip."}
{"text":"What can you say about a place that is so successful that they can open a 2nd location just 2 block away and keep both of them packed?  Yes, the food is that good.  I took my daughter and her family there after an outing at Lake Mead.  With my daughter - there was no contest .. she LOVED the place.  Even my son-in-law who detests seafood, managed to shnork down 2 pounds of Canjun shrimp.  Please note that unless you met the lady while SCUBA diving, this is NOT the place to take a first date with thoughts of impressing her.  Eating here is pure \"Hands On\" and it can get messy.  So, let the kid in you out and dig in with Both hands!"}
{"text":"The reason for my review today is not to rave about their food, which is great, but their employees. One in particular at this location, Juan. Today I left my keys on the table, silly accident. I was positive the keys were on the table. I called twice & no one seemed to help. So I came up there being that I was positive I left them there. So instead of the back & forth w/ my server about what he did do and why he couldn't have threw them away. I asked if I could look myself, after all it's my fault and my keys so I have no problem finding them. I can't blame him for not wanting to help look it's a seafood restaurant so it was pretty gross. Juan, who was not my server btw, got in the dumpster & found my keys. I then tried to tip him for helping me. Being that he just saved me money on a new starter and he didn't even accept it. Awesome. Thanks so much Juan I really appreciate you for getting dirty for me."}
{"text":"When you walk thru the door, you will be met with the most delicious aroma of butter and garlic.  It makes me want to eat everything.  Then the crawfish comes with the sauce.  The sauce makes everythihg tastes good. I want to drink the sauce and or bathe in it.  It doesn't matter, I just want to be drenched in it.  It's that good! THE SERVICE WAS HORRIBLE but I would go back for the food."}
{"text":"I heard about this place on the travel channel about a year back, finally was able to get down to Vegas and try the Crawfish.    everything is alcart, except for the deep fried stuff. i had 2 pounds of the Crawfish with a side of rice and rolls. the server was right, there's not much meat on them, 2pds instead of 1 was a good choice. the corn that came in the same bag as the crawl fish, it was the best part of the whole meal, its soaked in the butter n juices of the Crawfish.  my meal costed 30$ not including drinks, kinda high but ..........it was worth trying at least once. for  a authentic crawl fish boil  and a interesting eating experience this is the place to go."}
{"text":"NOM NOM NOM!!!  HOT N JUUUUICY! SO good. But for the name, hot n juicy CRAWFISH, I would SKIP the crawfish! I've tried the frozen AND the fresh and it just seems like a waste...  I do prefer this place over Boiling Crab! We usually get snow crab legs, shrimp and oysters on the half shell. Our go to sauce is the Hot N Juicy Medium. Nice and spicy and flavorful. They offer you gloves for your hands but they are the big loose ones so I just opt out of those - they have a roll of paper towels on your table so you're pretty good with using those and then a quick trip to the bathroom to wash it all off. One of the sinks you have to keep pressing for water which is quite annoying because your hands are pretty messy afterwards so if they have two sinks that just stayed ON, it would be much better!  You do have a garlic taste in your mouth for at least a day after eating here but that's the price you pay for buttery garlicy goodness! NOM!"}
{"text":"Angry crab is better.  The tables are lined with plastic and you get bibs and even plastic gloves but the gloves are just about useless after a few minutes.  Then you don't even get waste buckets so you're just making a mess pile and eating on the mess pile.  The logistics are just so much tighter at angry crab but I also thought the flavors didn't really get into the seafood as well at this place either.  I'm not sure, but I think they don't have beer either.  :/"}
{"text":"This place exceeded my expectations. The food was phenomenal, I highly recommend getting Cajun fries as a side, pretty much goes with anything you order. The service was great, they were very attentive with what you need and quick to fulfill them. I give credit to the management as well for being so polite and keeping the place running smoothly."}
{"text":"the food was absolutly great ...grrat service great experience ... definitly neex to come back ...and are waitress was awsome ..!"}
{"text":"Perfect calamari, light and crisp, the fried catfish, shrimp and steamed red potatoes were excellent. They even cooked the chicken wings to perfection! Nicole is an amazing server and suggests foods according to your tastes. You're going to wonder why you didn't come by sooner. I'm selective about seafood, coming from a family that steams up and fries up New Orleans seafood. Hot N Juicy Crawfish in Tempe is for seafood lovers."}
{"text":"So I've tried to go twice already, each time was a 45 minute wait and each time I end up at Cajun Crawfish (big mistake btw).  I finally decided to do take out, taking that this is the ONLY way I don't have to wait and the food is ready in 15 minutes. The stench of garlic seeped through the bag as I grabbed it and put it in my car.  i KNEW this was going to be good.  I ordered 1 lb of Lemon Pepper crawfish + 1 lb of garlic butter crawfish.  I can't believe I'd been missing out! It was SO GOOD!  I ate until my lips were numb.  It was delish.   I can't believe I went to Cajun Crawfish each time I couldn't get into Hot N Juicy.  NEVER again!  I paid about 25 bucks for 2 lbs of crawfish I believe?  Well worth it tho."}
{"text":"Food is usually good, called this order to go, and the girl was extremely rude! Needed to add to my order and it was like If was killing her to put in a side of fries for my child..then I try ordering sweet tea and she said they don't give sweet teas to go..Never calling in an order... We shall see if we even bother coming in if the waitresses are going to be this rude!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time the shrimp it's not even fresh, poor customer service and it seems that employees are not team orientated"}
{"text":"The shrimp is amazing here and garlic butter is my go to sauce. I wish the crawfish had more meat especially since the store specializes in them. The crab and shrimp are the best things to get."}
{"text":"Omg this place is amazing! Definitely nothing of this quality & flavor in Vancouver, Canada.  Service was great... on top of refilling your water or soda & checking if you need anything. I went through a lot of gloves as they kept ripping due to friction or heat but I was quickly given a new pile of gloves to go through.  We tried the \"get your feet wet\" option - 1lb crawfish, 1lb shrimp, 2 potatoes, 2 corn & plenty of sausage ($36). Tried the hot n juicy sauce - spicy level. It was a great spice & the flavor was perfect. 2 of us found it difficult to finish.   Really wish we had this in Vancouver... I'm craving it already!"}
{"text":"Hot 'Juicy Crawfish for dinner tonight. So good!!! First time here and my waitress couldn't be lovelier. Guided my experience so well and gave me free samples of the crawfish first. Went with a lb of the crawfish with the hot ' juicy sauce. The hot n' juicy sauce is literally finger lickin' good. The crawfish was a lot of work though. Think I'm going to go for the snow crab legs next time I come. They got me all bibbed up, so messy, but so much fun!"}
{"text":"Beyond amazing food!! Get the mild hot 'n juicy on anything!! Go here every time I'm in Vegas !!"}
{"text":"Good but not the best seafood boil I've had before. I got a mix of crawfish and shrimp in spicy hot n juicy seasoning. I will have to try their other locations to see if it's any different."}
{"text":"If I could rate 0 star I would ! Very rude staffs and management. Who the hell hired these people ? No one look like they want to work, the waitress gave us the bill but the food didn't come yet . DO NOT GO HERE !!!! You will regret it!"}
{"text":"We used to regularly frequent this establishment but has gone down hill recently. Shrimp overcooked, difficult peeling, when it was brought to the attention of our waiter, nothing. Waiting tirelessly for refills & nobody checking on us during off peak, unacceptable. Mussels not debeareded, simple amenities like bibs and napkins not available, I'm done. We easily spend $100 every visit, I'd rather lose that at a blackjack table. More like Not so hot n juicy"}
{"text":"Alberto's (original) Alerto's (copy) Albertaco's (copy) Alberta's (copy) Albatros (copy) Viva Burrito (CO's copy) Sarah Palin (original) Tina Fey (a likable version) Tommy's (original) Johnny's (copy) Boiling Crab (original) Hot'n'Juicy Crawfish (copy)  Within a matter of five or so years, Boiling Crab has managed to open 7+ locations and it's spurred on a crab/crap load of copy cats and imitators. Hot'n'Juicy is one of them (why reinvent the wheel?).  This is how I think Hot'n'Juicy Crawfish Gentlemans Club stacks up against the original Boiling Crab in CA and TX.  CONS: 1. \"It's too much work eating crawfish\", so instead you'll get these huge monstrous crawfish that amount to about 12 in a bag vs. the 50-60 at BC. 2. The flavors?? They just didn't blend as well as BC's, and the crawfish just wasn't immersed long enough in the mixture to absorb any of the flavors. What you get, is some bland crawfish. 3. Even though BC has a slightly cheesy interior, I still love BC by far. You just can't beat their original locations signs in the men's bathroom which read: \"players with shorter bats should stand closer to home plate\" or \"why are you looking up here, when the joke is in your hands\". 4. The waitstaff and service at BC has always been fairly attentive and friendly no matter how busy it gets. HJC's was straightforward and rather distant.  PRO'S: 1. Basically the menu was the same basic menu as BC, so it did make ordering really easy. 2. No wait times! BC usually always has a minimum of a 1 hour wait time for dinner. HJC wasn't too busy for a Tuesday night. 3. The freshness of the dungeness crab was REALLY GOOD at HJC. Probably the best I've had almost anywhere... where are they getting it from!?!?  THE BOTTOM LINE: Always imitated, never duplicated! Boiling Crab definitely reigns supreme, and I highly doubt I'd go back to Hot'n'Juicy unless they start to offer lap dances."}
{"text":"We were referred here by friends of ours while vacationing in Las Vegas. We came close to closing after taking a show in and were helped out as soon as we came in. Since we were new to the place, our server ran down the basics, took our drink order, ( raspberry iced teas, very yummy ) and then we ordered. 1/2lb shrimp spicy garlic, 1lb xtra spicy w/ garlic, a dozen oysters, and 2 orders spicy calamari's. we waited a bit with the oysters coming out fairly quickly. OMG, I can't believe its been soooo long since I have eaten oysters!! VERY GOOD!!! Our order arrived, really tasty and I really didn't mind peeling the shrimp. They didn't rush to get us out and stayed very accommodating. Will we visit again?? Without a doubt!!! Thank you very much for making the end of our night, memorable!! 5***** stars!!"}
{"text":"located in a strip mall in las vegas chinatown. so delicious!! waiters were super helpful w recommendations and service. service was great and restaurant was clean.   came on a tues afternoon for lunch. we were immediately seated and ordered drinks.  we got 2lb of hot and juicy spiced crawfish mild ( which was actually medium spicy. just as the waiter warned us), a 1.4 lb garlic butter med spicy lobster, and a pound of lemon pepper mild spiced shrimp  ( also rec by waiter... and im so glad we got it). fyi all came heads and shells on in plastic bags so it gets messy... but there is a roll of paper towels at your table. so worth the stains i made on my dress .., thats why they invented shout spray! we also got 3 pieces of corn and a potato and a bowl of rice. oh man crawfish+ rice = amazeballs!!  saw a couple eating the crawfish with plastic gloves on... uh isnt half the fun getting all up in the shellfish and licking the juice off??   wished i lived in vegas if only to eat here! everything was on point and fresh."}
{"text":"Took my wife and dauuhter here and the food was amazing. Got 2 pounds of crab crawfish shrimp ans sausage. We literally ran thru planet hollywood to get there b4 they closed. I would reccomend this spot to anyone that enjoys seafood"}
{"text":"Similar style to Boiling Crab in California, and to compare the two, I would say this place tops them! First of all, we came at roughly mid-afternoon (3:30 pm) and there was no wait at all; Unlike if I was to go to Boiling Crab I would be waiting a little bit around this same time because of how popular they are (and to be fair, it has been awhile since I last visited them). Now onto the food! The flavor was deep and rich! I couldn't stop digging in, and before I knew it finished 1/2 lb of shrimp in a matter of minutes. The best part was peeling the shrimp on top of my rice to let the sauces fall and soak in the rice. Their king snow crab was absolutely delicious as well. Cracking, breaking, and digging for the meat never felt so easy and tastes so good! In addition to the food, our primary server Alison (I believe that's how her name was spelled), delivered such wonderful customer service the entire ambiance felt as if one was eating at relative's during the holidays. She was sweet, kinda, and very genuine to talk to. Her along with her fellow co-workers were on top of their customer service for not just my table, but other tables as well. I saw refilling drinks in a timely manner, joking with the customers, and making the environment very welcoming. Overall, I am very impressed and happy with my first visit here, and I would definitely come back to visit whenever I'm in Vegas again!"}
{"text":"Too much work. I don't like to order a meal and work with my hands?I had a pound of garlic butter shrimp  and corn  fritters."}
{"text":"My first time dealing with this sort of dining experience. No utensils & have to dissect your food- what? After a little apprehension; I was getting down and dirty. So, glad I did get past that awkwardness of ripping apart the whole shrimps because it was more than worth it! The bib is a great idea & highly suggested. Definitely not a place to wear nice or light colored clothing to. I ended up getting Medium for heat because that's what the waitress had suggested. However, the only thing that seemed some what spicy was the corn at the bottom of the bag. The overall taste of their signature Hot & Juicy seasoning was perfect! I will definitely return to this restaurant next time I'm in Nevada. Thank you for such a fun, interactive, and memorable experience!"}
{"text":"This is the best and most unique shrimp recipe I have ever tried. Good seafood quality, good price, good taste, different atmosphere and delicious."}
{"text":"I didn't eat seafood at all until I moved to Vegas and met Hot N Juicy. Now, shellfish is my favorite food! We have been here at least 10 times, but this review will focus on our Valentine's Day experience.   There are three locations now in Vegas, and this is apparently the original one in the city. It is in an old beat up strip mall of sorts, and this is definitely not a fancy type establishment. But the restaurant is clean and there are no complaints in that regard, it is just on the \"bare bones\" side of things.   Service: we went early on V-Day because we knew it'd be busy. We were quoted 20 minutes and were seated in 5. Our server was polite, attentive, and helpful with our beverage questions. Food was delivered quickly and multiple people checked in with us and offered refills and extra gloves.   Food: I do agree that most of the sauces taste very similarly, but if you're coming here to eat sauce, you kind of lost the point...At least three taste the exact same to me. If you want contrast, lemon pepper doesn't taste anything like the Hot n Juicy flavor in my opinion. The shellfish is incredibly fresh and well cooked (you can tell by how it comes out of the shells), and the variety of multiple types of muscles and multiple times of crab is nice.   My only real complaint (not enough to lose a star over), is that I wish there were more vegetable options. I like having more than a small ear of corn with my meals...  I strongly recommend this place to anyone who enjoys shellfish."}
{"text":"Great place to go for crawfish in Vegas!  I like it better than Boiling Crab, not sure if it's better than Red Crawfish, though.  Definitely go to this location vs the one up the street.  Larger space, shorter wait.  If you like spicy foods, go for the Spicy or Extra Spicy option.  I ordered a pound of crawfish and half a pound of shrimp.  I definitely prefer the crawfish.  All of the seafood is fresh, but the shrimp seemed too meaty, and less sweet to me (maybe it was just that shipment).  But if you're a shrimp only person, you may not notice the difference."}
{"text":"There are not too many places where I feel a bib is necessary to eat, I mean I'm an adult and can handle putting food in my mouth without spilling it all over myself.  Hot N Juicy is the rare exception to this rule.  Breaking into crawfish and sucking the juice from their heads is messier than one would expect.    I can vouch for the crawfish, crab legs and lobster.  I'm also a huge fan of the Hot N Juicy Special seasoning.  I have kind of a \"When in Rome\" approach to food ... if something is a specialty or a namesake, more often than not it's damn good.  When I lived in Vegas, I would frequent this place often and bring visitors from out of town here.  Never a dissatisfied experience or visitor.  A few thing to keep in mind though ... expect to wear a bib and smell like Hot N Juicy for the rest of the day ... maybe into the next day.  This place is also crowded, expect to wait ... It's well worth the wait though.  Hot N Juicy is an experience, be ready to get your hands dirty."}
{"text":"Hot N Juicy has the best crawfish in Vegas hands down! I order 2lbs of hot N juicy flavor crawfish and loved every single bite! The spice is on point! So be ready to sweat lol  Cajun fries are great here too! I really only go for the crawfish so I have no clue what else on the menu taste like. The wait on weekends is more then 30 minutes so I recommend going on a weekday. The service is great and fast. Love love this place!"}
{"text":"Finally made it back to give Hot N Juicy another try.  I am pleased to say everything was great.  Someone gated new as soon as I walked in and I was sitting at a table within 1 min.  We ordered a Get Your Feet Wet and some fried brownies for dessert.  The shrimp, crawfish, sausage, corn,  and potatoes were really good and the hot n juicy sauce was good also.  We will be back for more.."}
{"text":"Soooo yummy!  I was very hangery.  Lemonade was my server and she was awesome. She was patient and very good at gaging what I would like. She's very good, sweet and friendly and professional. Always checked on me, filled my water and gave me a water to go. The shrimp was fresh, and sweet. I wasn't sure if I could handle the spicy sauce. Asked Lemonade if I could get it on the side and she said yes. Her recommendations were spot on. Thank you, best meal in Vegas so far!!!   Alexis with curls came by and check on me, a lone diner. Can't wait to come back!!! Aloha and mahalo"}
{"text":"I'm love this place!! Always went the one next to DJK on Spring Mountain, there's 2 locations..within like quarter mile..you know it's bumping if they needs 2 stores that close to each other. It's the hot juicy sauce. Idk if it's coincidence or its because it's in Vegas but the staff is all so cute, I got calendar with all girls who there..not slutty, but Rockabilly Orange County cute..best thing..Best priced seafood.,This on Eastern right across  the street from work.. whoop, whoop!! Been schooling my clients.. check it out. But be where, it's like crack..you'll get hooked. BOMB!!"}
{"text":"This place is so bomb, the second you walk in, it smells so good.. you start drooling. The staff is super cute and friendly, casual atmosphere.. You get seated, the menu is super simple, we ordered king crab shrimp.  2 pounds each, 1 steamed rice.. you can other seafood, other sides, that's what we got, you can choose the level of how hot you want to go... I went 2nd to the hottest.. it was delicious.. . There's no silverware, plates, literally...everything comes in a plastic bag, you get bibs, the rice came in plastic bowl with a spoon.. you get a little  messy. They give you  gloves, they're optional. ..you get your grub on...maybe not the best place for a 1st date... it's definitely  one of my favorites. .5 stars.."}
{"text":"Been here three times, & the food has been delicious every time. Fair value for your buck. Hot and juicy, succulent shrimp and crayfish indeed. I gave it 4/5 because the waitress kept forgetting about things during our most recent stop (extra scoop of rice, refills of water for our spicy meal, Cajun fries), until we hailed her down to remind her."}
{"text":"Wow shitty service to say the least ...after me and my date were sat at our table it took over 1 hour and 30 to get served any food(which we never recieved) ...needless to say everyone around us was getting served but us ..there were people who came after us and got served before us...so not only did we not get our food we just up and walked out of that establishment ...it's one thing when your waiter tells you it's going to be a little longer because they are backes up but not for 1 hour and 30 minutes ...will never be returning ever again! P.s. the staff is completely clueless when we asked for the manager..the manager didn't even know where we were seated"}
{"text":"Alright sooo I have a buddy in Vegas who claimed that this place was the shit and way better than Boiling Crab and Claws out here in Orange County so I had to put it to the test. Took a trip to Vegas with a group of our friends and decided to have dinner with one of my friends friends who said we could try this place.   When we got there it looked to be pretty busy with a fifteen to twenty minute wait which wasn't to bad. The host was pretty cool and talked to us for a bit while we waited for our table. We finally got seated and ordered right away. It pretty much took them 20 minutes or more for them to come out and let us know that our food was going to be coming out a little late due to the rush they had. 10-15 minutes after that was when our food came out. The sauce was good but a bit watery. The shrimp was perfect and not over cooked. The service was alright with the waiter coming to check on his here and there. As I was eating one of the remaining shrimp that was left in the bag I noticed a thick black hair on the head of the shrimp. Normally I would think it was just the whiskers or whatever you want to call it from the shrimp but NO it was straight up a pubic hair with the little white thing on bottom tip of it from wherever the hair was from. My friend decided to take the piece of shrimp with pube still on it up to the front and complain. The asshole Caucasian male waiter gave her attitude and claimed it wasn't hair and that it was one of the whiskers from the shrimp. He said that the hair wasn't purely black and that there was a redish color to it which was bull shit. So my friend came back to sit down with us and was irritated with the waiter for handling the situation the way he did. The host that was talking to us before we got seated walked by and we showed him the hair and even he himself knew it was a piece of hair. He joked around and said \"well thats obviously not my hair.\" and laughed because he had a buzzed head. He finally took care of the situation and took the order of shrimp off the bill for us and apologized.   Overall... place is over priced compared to what the Cali prices are. The sauce is not too bad but not what I imagined it to be after all the hype. And lastly the service sucked balls but the only thing that made up for it was the host who was nice enough to help us out. Would I go back there ever again? Absolutely not!"}
{"text":"Best soft shell crab ever! Jared was our server and he's so awesome! very accommodating and nice.."}
{"text":"This place was actually recommended to me by the office staff where I live and I'm glad I tried it. Before now I would make that nice drive from Henderson to Las Vegas to enjoy boiled seafood at the boiling crab...even though it was nothing compared to the taste of the boiling back home.   Since I tried hot and juicy I have not been back to BC, it might mainly be that it's closer. The prices are a tad bit more but it's worth it. I always get a pound of shrimp hot and juicy medium and a pound of snow crab the same way.  Warning: if you love spice I still say start with the medium and work your way up, their food runs hot! Lol but everyone's taste buds are different but I just know I can handle more spice than most and even I had to relax on the spicy/extra spicy.  Overall great food, I've had decent service times I ate inside, last time I called an order in, they already knew my name which added a personal touch to the order...JUST GO EAT! Lol"}
{"text":"Skinny crab legs along with bad work by the kitchen makes this place a must miss. Go to angry crab instead, that's what this place is trying to be."}
{"text":"Saw this place on Man V Food and hubby insisted that we try it..  It's not bad.. but it's not great.. at least in my opinion.  We ordered two dungeness crabs and a pound of shrip.  We got the hot and juicy combo sauce at the mild spice.  We also ordered rice and I got the etouffe.  Being Filipino, we can't really eat anything without our rice.. and sadly, they ran out of rice and we had to wait about 15-20 minutes to get ours.  They were so nice and apologetic about it that they took the rice off of our bill and gave it to us for free!   The rice came out cooked, but a little on the drier side than I prefer.. I don't know if it was because they were in a hurry to get it out.. or if that's the way they just cook their rice.. either way.. I was glad I had the etouffe to moisten my rice up.  The seafood was pretty good.  The sauce was a little runnier than what I'm used to.. we got to Bucket Crabs and Crawfish in Ontario and their sauce is thicker than here.. and that's something I prefer.    The sauce here at hot and juicy was spicy at the mild level and that's how we like it!  If given a choice, I think I would still prefer Bucket Crabs than here..  it was a nice treat to get to eat at a place featured on TV tho.."}
{"text":"Good food, great service. The Drool is the best bang for your buck. Please don't try to eat this solo, it's a 2 man job!   The only gripe is that the mild tasted like a medium."}
{"text":"Just moved here from Cali && this was myb1st spot to hit soon as I landed! I didn't even bother to unpack lol. I had been researching for weeks prior to my arrival and this place was at the top of my list.  When you 1st pull up you realize its a small place but I was hoping for the best. Upon walking in we were greeted and told it would be about a 20 min wait but we were able to order some beers to sip on while we waited so that was a major plus!   We ordered the lobster, snow crab legs, shrimp, && king crab legs! Oh ma gawd it was to die for. We got our spicy but it was a perfect spice not over bearing! The kids even loved them!   Service was decent; if I had any complaints itd be that they ran out of the shell crushing thing (not sure what its called but if u eat seafood its the metal thing u use to open to open up ur lobster) but other than that the food was awesome the price is about right. We paid $160+ for a party of 7 (including 4 rounds of beer)  Highly recommend it! We will be back again and again"}
{"text":"I usually go to Boiling Crab but I decided to try Hot-n-Juicy crawfish and I was delighted with my decision. I ordered a pound of lemon pepper crawfish among other things and it did take a few minutes but when I received my order I had nothing to complain about. The restaurant is a bit chaotic and small but my girlfriend and I had a great server I believe her name was Lauren or Laura, which had us laughing and gave us great customer service.  Overall Boiling Crab has more flavors and seasonings but the customer service at Hot-n-Juicy is definitely superior and can't forget they have a great drink selection"}
{"text":"Excellent seafood place, especially for a desert city. Its so new, that it's not even posted as a location on the franchise webpage yet. so it's crazy that they're already this busy by just word of mouth. The service was good and responsive.  The crawfish are not as large as in other yelp pics. I'll skip it next time, but thats just bc I'd rather eat their other stuff. The oysters were large, but just ok. Shrimp and king crab was good. Most impressive, they don't skimp on the spices and seasoning. There's plenty for flavoring, and re-dipping. It would greatly help if there were better (written) descriptions of the flavors, maybe even offer samples of the sauces."}
{"text":"What an amazing app experience.  A unique and tasty find so close to everything.  Love spicy and love seafood and this delivered.  The hardest working waitress in Las Vegas, Micah, was attentive and helpful with out order.  The crab spices were perfect.  I got to wear gloves and I never wear gloves.  Gonna dream about my return.  Stop questioning.  Just go!"}
{"text":"Delicious. Not fully up to Louisiana standard but very close. Highly recommend the Hot and Juicy in whatever you order. We got the shrimp and crawfish. There were some huge crawfish in that 1 lb bag. 1 lb bag will feed 1 person, maybe. We ended up ordering one more bag. Will definitely be back next time we are in town."}
{"text":"My first review in Vegas!  I'm starting to feel all hot n juicy on the inside!! (haha kidding of course) This is definitely a place to come by if you want to hang out with some friends and family, a very very casual place to eat.  As you know, it's going to get messy.  It was my first time in a place like this, and even me, who's a guy that likes to try new things, I still had to wear gloves when I was eating all the food.  You can choose to not wear gloves, but your hands will stink (especially if you order it hot and juicy, which is all the sauces mixed into one)  Even on a wed night, there was about a 30 minute wait.  The waitstaff is all really cool.  Atmosphere is relaxed.  But eating the food is not as relaxing as the rest of the place.  We were sweating, the food can be very spicy if you want it to be, be careful!  I wouldn't come here on a first date either.  Ripping off shrimp heads awkwardly wearing gloves (or not) may be too much to handle for some people.    I would def come back, it's great place to have a bunch of food and get your seafood craving satisfied."}
{"text":"No, just no. Don't even glance at this place. I don't understand why people rave about it. It was annoying the moment you park your car because that just mean you have to pay for parking. My experience here was pretty damn annoying. I order crawfish and snow crab. The snow crab was small and cold and they gave crawfish to someone else so I had wait for an hour for another batch that they didn't clean. So it's dirt with the sauce. And what made it worse is that they didn't even apologize. Thank you but no thank you. Don't waste your time, if you want Cajun seafood experience, go to Angry Crabshack. There's free parking, the sauce is so much better, and the lbs are bigger and meaner. Hot n' juicy-you can't even compete."}
{"text":"My second visit in a week. We only waited 5 minutes for heaven. My wife had the crab, less than mild, garlic butter with corn and potato. She loved it. I had the shrimp, medium, hot & juicy flavor with corn and potato. The flavor was so delicious I will now only go with the hot & juicy flavor for now on. The corn was tender and the beer was cold. They must put something addicting in the flavor because I already want to go back. They were having a special on lobster, 16.99 a pound. I will try that next time."}
{"text":"Love love love this place!!! We always get :  2 lbs snow crab lemon pepper medium  2 pounds of shrimp (1-HOT N JUICY MED 1-lemon pepper medium) 4 potatoes (2 hot n juicy medium 2 lemon pepper medium)  I prefer this location as the Chinatown is ALWAYS packed, and their service is sometimes lacking.   This location never disappoints! Service, food, and cleanliness are always top notch!"}
{"text":"First time there and will doubtfully be back. Food was ok, but service was non existent.   Went there for a quick bite before we went shopping. Shown to a table and forgotten about. Server showed up a few minutes later and asked if we had been served.  When the food showed up, the server checked the tag on the bag, but did not check if everything was in there. (Potatoes and Corn) Took 5 minutes to flag someone down and let them know. But she didn't do anything about it and let our server know. She came and asked what was missing with an attitude.  When she came back with the potatoes and corn, we were pretty much done with our crawfish and shrimp. Then she asked why we were not using a bucket for our shell pointing to the pile on the table, ummm, first time there, didn't know about the bucket. Again, attitude.  Food was OK, having spent 5 years on the Gulf Coast, I have had way better, but this is Arizona so I will give them credit."}
{"text":"This place was soooo much fun! Prepare for a possible 30 min wait! But it's worth the wait , fun fun fun . Food was great , experience was delightful ! Outside dining was excellent ! Allen was our server and made the experience that much more fun! Allen rocked ! Thanks"}
{"text":"I've been to this place about three times and I'm still not tired of it! I have also been to the boiling crab in san jose, california but it does not compare to our louisiana style crawfish! If you do not like breaking the shells of the crawfish, shrimps are the way to go! There are also various seasoned flavors that the shrimps or crawfish are cooked in, but be prepared to taste a little spice! Oh! Another tip, be prepared to wait. Sometimes the waiting list is about an hour!! But you'll enjoy it overall. It is one thing everyone must experience! You get hot n juicy bibs and you also can get down and dirty with your hands, so you can choose to wear gloves. If you also like rice with your seafood, a bowl of rice is $2."}
{"text":"Food was good and fresh. Service was great the staff was extremely accommodating. The corn fritters were too sweet for me, but everything else was great. I regret not ordering more in bag items. We got the pound of shrimp. Seeing the head on was a bit scary at first; after you taste the first one all that goes out the window. Highly recommend giving it a try!!!!"}
{"text":"Such amazing flavors!  We stopped in for lunch and tried the crawfish and the shrimp. We went for very mild spice which was great, but still left a nice lingering burn, and tried the hot n juicy & the garlic butter.  Both were excellent - quite literally finger licking good.  This is a messy experience, but that is all part of the fun.  A great meal to share with a group of friends so everyone can try a bit of something new."}
{"text":"Loves this place. I first came here in 08'around the time they first opened in Vegas. I recently visited and they've expanded the place a bit, but the food is still great. When you're craving a bucket of just seafood and no fillers this is the place. The staff is exceptionally great as well. Not very many beers on tap, but hopefully in some time they will expand that too."}
{"text":"My bf and I wanted to try something different so we decided on hot and juicy. So glad we did, service was fast and super friendly! Our server Aubree ROCKED! Super sweet and very knowledgable of the menu. Some of the most flavorable shellfish we've had anywhere."}
{"text":"Worst Hot n Juicy in town. Gave them too many chances and they always screw up. They are not consistent, everytime you come the flavors are different. One time our shrimp were no cook well. Total disaster!! The service is also pretty bad. The Spring Mountain Rd. location is the best. Won't return here again!"}
{"text":"Love la love their hot n juicy seasoning whether it was over the crawfish or the shrimp it's sooo good.   But I've had juicer crawfish meaning the amount of juice at the bottom of the bag didn't live up to it's name. More juice!"}
{"text":"What a terrible experience. Have always gone to the one in China town and that one is great. Was close by so figured it would be the same. Boy was I wrong. This young blonde girl who started as our waitress (I told them to not send her back) seemed to be on drugs or left her brain at home. We ordered 1 lbs of baby spice shrimp butter garlic, 1 lbs of lemon pepper medium, 1 lbs of lemon pepper medium with corn, 3 rice, 2 waters,  and 1 unsweetened tea. First she brought me raspberry tea, corrected her it was unsweetened tea, brought it to me with sugar on the side. Smh. Food got here and got about 1 1/2 lbs of the butter garlic that was the complete opposite of baby spice. Then the other 1 lbs bags were about half a pound, and one was missing corn. Had to constantly ask for refills on my tea. My auntie wanted the least hot spice, and got the hottest on the menu, no wonder she was so miserable by the time we finished. I will NEVER come back to this location,  now as I'm writing this and get my check, she brings my check with charging me 4 lbs. Looking for the GM. This place is a joke. Stand by..... Ok so GM tried to fix the ticket and messed that up. Ended up leaving being charged for 2lbs, 3 rice, 1 corn. Sure hope this GM can turn this place around."}
{"text":"Loved it.  We've been all over the country racing with my son ans stop and fun places to eat all the time.  My son was the one that found this place and from the service to the food perfection and delicious.  Recommend juicy Cajun medium or spicy on crawfish and shrimp.  Absolutely loved it."}
{"text":"Very good, good value, friendly staff! I prefer the shrimp, but the crawfish is just as good. I highly recommend this place to anyone who enjoys sea food. Btw be prepared to eat a lot of food! Portions are good!"}
{"text":"We went there for something new, good service and good selection on the menu.  The craw fish and shrimp were very good, with good portions.  I was disappointed with the size and price of the oysters, $21.99 for a dozen small oysters.  We also ordered calamari, it was about half the portion of what I am used to.  You can do better at any of the station Casio oyster bars and save some money."}
{"text":"You have to have there hot and juicy signature sauce on everything from crabs to craws from shrimp or lobs gotta have it, perfection every time! Don't use the gloves use your bare hands, savor your garlic smelly hands for days to come washing wont get it undone, so smell and whiff it in the garlic that unites the hot & juicy brethren"}
{"text":"I always visit this place when I'm in Vegas! It absolutely delicious here. Way better than boiling crab in California--San Jose, Sacramento, Alhambra, Orange County--and just as yummy as the Seafood Shack in Anaheim. The prices are relatively same as in Cali: $9.99/lb of shrimp. $10.99/lb of crawfish. $8.99/half a dozen of oysters. $24.99/lb of king crab legs. (They were out of dungess crab, which was disappointing). The sauce options were more than most places I've been to: Louisiana style, Cajun style, butter garlic, lemon pepper, and hot n juicy special.   This time I took my family here for dinner during our Christmas vacation in Vegas.  When our party of 5 arrived we were told the wait would be 25 minutes, but after 10 minutes we were seated. Our server was Mathew. He was completely awesome: Super nice, friendly, funny, and attentive. The oysters were so sweet! My father, hubby, and I gulped them down as soon as they came out--Matt dropped by to make sure we'd already gotten our oysters and was surprised we'd already finished them all. It was that good. We ordered the soft shell basket (fried soft shell crab on cajun fries) and everyone love that. Although, for $10.95 we should've gotten more than 6 pieces, it was mostly fries. The crawfish was juicy and succulent. However, most of them were on the small side. The king crab legs were huge and meaty. Near the end of dinner, my dad wanted another order of Cajun fries. Unfortunately, Matt forgot to put in our order right away that we didn't get it 'til after we paid for our dinner. Matt was totally responsible and owned up to his mistake. We got our fries @ a discount: FREE. :)   To conclude: the experience, the food, & the service was really good."}
{"text":"Man v Food is one of my favorite shows and you always hear Adam say how great every single place he stops off at is. I always wonder if everywhere can be THAT amazing. I actually came to this place randomly with my girlfriend when we were in Las Vegas and she was craving crawfish. We came here before we knew it was on the show and we had no idea what to expect.  We came on a saturday afternoon and the place was completely empty. We were the only customers in the building... For a saturday afternoon i didnt see that as being a good sign. We ordered a pound of Crawfish, cajun fries and i ordered myself some deep fried shrimp.  I was not a fan of the crawfish, but most notably the sauce. We got mild or medium and it just wasnt very good. The fried shrimp was over battered and the shrimp did not taste fresh at all. i ended up not finishing the shrimp, and i ate fries most of the time i was there. My girlfriend finished the crawfish, didnt like it very much. We left and both agreed that we probably wont be back to this location again.  We were definitely comparing this place to Boiling Crab and nothing really compares to boiling crab.   The positives. The service was pretty good and friendly :)"}
{"text":"Update: cool place, peeps and very good food! Friendly atmosphere and wait staff. Food is top notch if you're craving some hot n juicy crawfish!"}
{"text":"Outstanding time. No wait, with immediate service. We thoroughly enjoyed the Shrimp, crawfish and green muscles in hot and juicy medium sauce. Jennifer, our sever did an outstanding job. We wanted for nothing. Also a manager came by to check on us as well. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This spot has pretty fair prices compared to its competitors. We had a 1LB of crawfish, 1LB of shrimp with rice and Cajun fries. The meal was good and we will be back. The reason Why I'm only giving 3 stars is strictly on customer service. Our sever had no interest in us from the beginning to end. I can understand if she was having a bad day, we all have them. But you have to understand you're representing a company and perception is everything."}
{"text":"Health and Safety should be the utmost in a restaurant. A family member of mine who we dined with last night had food poisoning 3 short hours after eating at the restaurant. I've called the the restaurant twice to report the issue not one return phone call.  Shame on Hot and Juicy Crawfish. Stay healthy stay away!"}
{"text":"I've been looking for a good crawfish spot in LV. This location is small with a small parking lot so come early!    I came around 1 or 2 pm and was greeted by a friendly, fresh faced girl who sat us right away. They didn't put our bibs on for us unlike a lot of places. (it gets kind of uncomfortable having a grown adult help you with your napkin ) they offered gloves to avoid the garlic smell stained to your hands for days!   We ordered a pound of King Crab and a pound of shrimp with medium hot n juicy sauce. I would say the medium sauce is definitely on the mild sauce so I would go higher if you like a nice kick. The crab was good but one leg seemed like it had been cooking a little too long. The shrimp were big and fresh.   All in all, this place did well and I will be returning"}
{"text":"Excellent food and friendly atmosphere. Had crawfish and shrimp. Delicious!!!!! The fries added the final touch to the meal. A must place to go when we visit Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Loved it! The food is delish! Customer service was great. Will be returning! I totally recommend it."}
{"text":"I had heard so much about this place, I finally met up with some friends for lunch to try it out! Do not come here if you are afraid of getting a little messy! I ordered a pound of crab legs and, after a little hesitation, dug right in! I have never had crab that you had to actually crack open the shell, it was very different! I absolutely loved it. My friends ordered the fried shrimp basket, rolls, corn, and crawfish. We left the restaurant with full stomachs and smiles. :-) I would reccommend this place to anyone who likes seafood!"}
{"text":"The sausage was SPICY, holy moley (flushed)! It wasn't even my order but we were sharing everything we ordered and I wanted to take that whole thing and just put it in front of me :-). First time here with friends and it is now bookmarked because I'm so coming back. I'm definitely ordering the sausage again with rice. They have all booths on the right side of the restaurant and all tables on the left. It's a small space so I'm sure it gets very crowded but we came here right when they opened so it was perfect for me. I had coffee with me and they didn't let me bring it to the table (boo!).   We also ordered the calamari, regular and cajun- I just love calamari, I see it on the menu, I order it. It's a given. Both were very good as well.   Shrimp by the pound- I was not in the mood to peel so I didn't touch that but I did order the fried shrimp basket with fries so I got my fix.   Overall: Fun place I'm looking forward coming back to with the family."}
{"text":"Great seafood.  Order the seafood in the bag, by the pound.  The fried options in baskets are not as good.  You cannot go wrong with the food.  Though place was not busy (only 3 tables occupied), still took a good 5 minutes before we got seated during lunch.  Once you get seated, they are prompt and right at your elbows for the refills."}
{"text":"Good for groups, no more than 7 but ideal for 2-4 people at a time because the space isn't large. Yummy seafood, chill and laid back vibes also! My guest ordered snow crabs and shrimp (comes in bags with your choice of seasoning, wet or dry). You have the option of adding small baked potatoes and corn in your bags of seafood. It gets messy, just so you know! And, your waiter will give you the tools to crack the shellfish. On the dryer side, you can order fried seafood baskets with your choice of regular, cajun or sweet potato fries. I ordered a 4-pc fried catfish basket with a basket of crispy pork skins. Customer service is decent, but honestly you're just gonna be focused on the food anyway!"}
{"text":"It wasn't good. The Shrimp has no flavor and I wasn't aware it would be full Shrimp with the heads."}
{"text":"Summary: Tasty food, but service for upstairs dining was not great. The etouffee was excellent, but they didn't have the fresh crawfish (only frozen). Expect a little bit of a wait if coming during the evening on a weekend. A fun meal if you don't mind getting your hands dirty.  My wife had been to the Washington DC Hot 'N Juicy earlier this year and had a blast with the food and experience. As a result, when she saw one was located just outside of our Elara abode she said we had to check it out for dinner. We went on a Saturday evening at around 8pm and the restaurant was full up with a wait. After about 10 minutes we were taken upstairs and seated.  Our server gave us a rundown of the menu and indicated that they didn't have any of the fresh crawfish available (what my wife was most excited to have). We perused and decided what we wanted, then waited for her to return to our table upstairs. Throughout the meal we had to usually wait a while to be visited, or even had to flag down other servers if they happened to be in the area since the majority of diners were downstairs. We also had to ask for gloves, silverware, etc instead of them just being offered or provided. Kind of annoying.  We ended up ordering a half pound of snow crab legs, the etouffee, and a pound of shrimp with some potatoes and corn, prepared spicy with the Hot N Juicy seasoning. The food was very good and was enough for the two of us with some leftovers of the etouffee to take back to our room. The price is certainly on the high side for most of the shellfish, but the quality was good and everything tasted good. We managed to stay clean by using the gloves and utensils (which definitely got messy), but the meal was fun and enjoyable overall."}
{"text":"The place is simple just like the food. Eating with your hands like a barbarian with oversize gloves.  Ordered  3 lbs of shrimp (not de-vein with heads on) in Medium spicy sauce with 4 corn and snow crabs, with sweet potato fries and Cajun fries.   They give you little plastic bibs and plastic gloves to wear. No plates so I used a lot of towels. Easy to clean up.. Most  the food comes in a huge bag. So you grab, peel and eat. It was a fun experience. Makes you feel like a little kid again eating with your hands LoLz. It gets messy don't wear white. Wear dark color clothes. hehee  But one of my friend is not used too eating without utensil and was not enjoying it as much. Also when they went home the toilet was loving him but his butt wasn't happy at all. Also the people who had to smell what came out was not happy too. sigh."}
{"text":"My review is based on the comparison between this place and my favorite cajun restaurant. Arrived here after day club around 2-3pm and there was no wait for our party which was great since we were all hungry. I ordered a pound of shrimp, medium spicy with the Hot n Juicy sauce. I thought the shrimps were cooked perfectly, not too soggy. The sauce was also delicious! I ordered some sausages to share with my party and compared to other places it wasn't as flavorful. My party also ordered chicken wings and the cat fish basket. Wings were standard and we did not enjoy the cat fish basket. It was mainly because of the breading they used. The texture was too grainy for our liking. The cajun fries were just okay as well, I prefer thinner and crispier fries. If you are coming here just for the cajun shrimp then you would enjoy it much more than I did. Overall I would come back again if I was in the area and craving cajun food."}
{"text":"Ok.  I'm writing this review as a seasoned crawfish eater, hitting up the OG (original if you don't know slang) crawfish places in Westminster....    This place was alright.  Their sauce wasn't very good, which is a major bummer, being that their crustaceans were pretty fresh.  The fries were meh.  Nothing special....  Maybe I've just been spoiled by places with sweet potato fries and yummy house sauces....  Good place to go if you're desperately craving seafood though"}
{"text":"Service was good. Food was good. We weren't disappointed at all.  I always forget how much of a pain in the buttocks it is to peel the shrimp, but the flavors were good."}
{"text":"I came here a few years back and remembered enjoying the food. I hadn't been back since then and after a night of staying out until the wee Vegas hours and a late night performance, my dance team and I were looking to get our grub on. We decided that this would be a great way to enjoy spending time together while eating yummy, spicy, Cajun goodness.  There were 17 of us so we were surprised that they could accommodate a party that large. We had to split up into 2 different tables, which that wasn't a problem for us. We're not high maintenance like that :) we were able to still interact and even share food!  They took our order right away and the food came out shortly. I ordered a 1/2lb. of shrimp, Mild, with all of the sauces, corn on the cob, white rice and Cajun fries to share. PLENTY of food and I ate ALL of it. Their \"mild\" was more like medium/hot. It was really funny watching everyone sweating from their food. I had a couple of friends order Medium or hot and they were DYING. So be careful if you're sensitive to spice levels because it's NOT what you will expect. Luckily, I LOVE spicy foods so the mild being medium/hot was a blessing in disguise. I'm pretty sure I thought about seconds and even packing leftovers because it was just THAT good   at the end of the meal, they were amazing enough to split the check for us. It was an awesome dining experience.   Note: there's another Hot & Juicy location down the way so if you're going to meet up with friends, make sure you specify which one on Spring Mountain Rd. PARKING IS LIMITED."}
{"text":"So good! Came in for the first time based on all the Yelp reviews and a huge craving for seafood. The service is great, our server explained to us how the menu worked and the difference between the seasonings and spice levels. Had a lb of shrimp hot and juicy style, baby spice. The bag comes nice and hot and the flavors are really soaked in there. I ordered a side of rice as well, it was a very generous serving and fills you up pretty quick FYI. Great location too and decent prices. And to top it all off, their music is on point. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Arrived at 830 on Friday night and was told we have a 1.5 hour wait. Ok it is Friday night but the problem is that half the tables in the restaurant were empty and one whole side of the patio tables facing the yard house were also sitting empty. What in the World. Shortage of servers or what. No excuse....."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. Prepare to get sauce all over you and smell weird for the next 2 days. I recommend not eating this before work if you have a night term shift and I also recommend the bib.   Other than that, this place rocks!"}
{"text":"OK,,, how do I even begin,,, let's see,,, ummm....  OK!!! I got it.  We were a group conversation a few months back and I mentioned something about eating crawfish in New Orleans. Then my fiance's cousin said something about Hot-n-Juicy and it somehow just stuck in my head. So yea,, Patrick and I in Vegas, properly buzzed and ready to throw down on some good sea bugs. Let's activate the Lyft and get a ride to Hot-n-Juicy heaven.  We walk in and we were immediately greeted, \"Welcome to Hot-n-Juicy!\"  \"Table for two please.\"  She smiles, takes a couple of bibs and menus, \"Right this way please.\"  We told her that it was our first time here and she told us the popular items,, crawfish and shrimp is their main draw. Their Hot-n-Juicy flavor is their most popular and we can choose from mild, medium and hot.  Ok, so a pound of shrimp, a pound of crawfish and an order of the dungeness crab. All hot-n-juicy, all hot spicy. The shrimp and crawfish arrives first. We start with the shrimp which was properly done. Not too rare and not too over cooked that it sticks to the shell. Just perfect, and the sauce a perfect combination. Then comes the crawfish, which was pretty much the best crawfish I have ever had so far. My gosh, their house sauce is just to die for. The crawfish is just the perfect vessel for all the garlicky spicy goodness. Then the dungeness crab comes... man oh man is it good. If you don't know how to properly eat a whole crab,,, please learn, you're missing out on this. If not,, then please don't even enter this place,,, just go back to your hotel and order room service. Get yourself chicken fingers and friend potato sticks,, trust me,, you'll have a wonderful time with that instead.  We had an AWESOME experience here. We even ordered an extra pound of crawfish because it was that freakin good. Next time I'm in town for some good seafood YAAAAAAAASSSSSSSS moments to enter my mouth. Uh-huh,,, that's for real!  I love you Hot-n-Juicy."}
{"text":"It's always a good idea to have Hot n Juicy. The shrimp and crawfish boil they're slinging here is my measuring stick for any spot that's doing the same thing.  We also bring people who hasn't had a proper shrimp and crawfish boil here. Order a pound at a time. They'll just tally it up by the time you're done.  Don't be afraid to get your hands dirty. The only protective covering your should wear is the bib. Remember, you don't wear your food, you eat it. Get the spicy sauce too,, trust me, you can handle this one.  Never have I had a bad experience coming here or to their other branch. I love the food and the service. Will definitely keep returning and bringing new people in.  Thank you so much for reading my review. I hope this helps your decision making experience. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!"}
{"text":"Service was terrible.  Seemed everything took 15-20 mins.  Sat at table...15 mins waitress shows up.  Ordered drinks didn't show up until second request 20 mins.   15 mins later order taken.  Forget about refills.  Check dropped off 15 mins later check and payment gotten.  I think u get the picture.  Food was good and not worth going back due to terrible service.  Hope folks have a better experience then we did."}
{"text":"First of all very messy, which I guess can be fun if you're 8 years old. Food was not very good at all; bland and covered with an underpowered Cajun spice. This place is an ecological Nightmare; everything from the Styrofoam cups and everything is plastic, including the yard waste sized plastic cover for the table! They just wrap everything up and toss it. I will never return to this place, or recommend it to any friends or tourists. Awful!"}
{"text":"tldr:  Old rotten shrimp that belonged in the bin.  Greasy inedible fried things with a topping of of bad service.  Really? Do you want to pay this really pretentious \"Market Price\" on seafood that's been floating in a metal bucket of lukewarm water for a week?  Classic Gordon Ramsay screaming ...  Overall -  Absolutely horrid is all I can say.  Food - minus one star.  Service - minus one star. Overall experience - Minus 2 stars.   Details - 8-24-2015 6:30 p.m.  We ordered two pounds of shrimp in H n' J sauce from medium to spicy.  The wait staff was indifferent except for the hostess who seemed at least partially aware that she was a paid employee.  The single male service person behind the counter was more concerned with chatting up his fellow female coworkers than taking our order, which i nearly shouted that we were ready to give (yet still ignored).  Classic Gordon Ramsay screaming should ensue...   The order taker insisted that I give her my telephone number, which I refused to do.  She stated that it was company policy because some people leave without paying.  Wait.  This was a pre-paid to-go order how could I even do that?  I gave her a number and she took my order.  Order came out promptly.  Paid 40+ bucks for two pounds of seasoned shrimp, 8 wings and an order of Corn Fritters.  Whatever.  Not a great value but not a rip-off I suppose.   Eating It -   Got home and opened my take out order and I have to say we did not, could not finish eating what was given to us because of several things:   - Market price?  Honestly I've had fresher shrimp at the Palms Casino buffet.  Hot and Juicy adjusts the price of their offerings based on market price of goods.  An upscale restaurant can justify \"Market Price\" when they are obtaining fresh ingredients on the day of service.  Hot and Juicy is certainly not an upscale restaurant obtaining fresh ingredients on the day of service.  In my view, the price the customer pays should get discounted, because the seafood we got on 8-24-2015 was dicey to say the least, and likely unfit for consumption.  Really? Do you want to pay this really pretentious \"Market Price\" on seafood that's been floating in a metal bucket of lukewarm water for a week?  Classic Gordon Ramsay screaming should ensue...   - Consistency of the shrimp in the same bag ranged from firm and fresh to powdery and obviously turned.  The majority of the shrimp we peeled were expired and belonged in the bin.  On whole I would say that the most of the batch was powdery, expired shrimp that were not kosher to serve.  Classic Gordon Ramsay screaming should ensue...     - They do not clean the gut-line of the shrimp!  Did you know that it may be possible to contract Hepatitis from improperly cleaned shrimp?  I understand that if they want to leave the shrimp peel and eat they can leave the shell on, but don't insult your customers by leaving the the bowels and their contents in the meal.  At least butterfly the top and remove the gut-line before boiling.  Sheesh!  Please tell me.  Would you want a beef steak with the guts hanging out on your plate when it is served?  \"Oh well this is the way it's usually done.\"  Bullshit!  How is this acceptable?  Classic Gordon Ramsay screaming should ensue...   -  The Corn Fritters, at 5.99 an order were just disgusting, greasy lumps of uncooked dough with corn pieces in them.  Disappointing and in a word, Inedible.  I don't know if they are forced to do this or what but, someone at the restaurant wrote on the the Styrofoam containers \"Corn Fritters, YUM!\"  Really?  IDK.  Have you ever felt embarassed for someone else though it has nothing to do with you?  \"Corn Fritters.  YUM?\"  No.. Just no.    Warning -  I don't know who owns this place and I have no grudge or anything like that.  It was just really, really bad.  Pictures coming up tomorrow morning when my wife decides to email me the pics.  nota bene - They have chicken nuggets on the menu for nine bucks or so that are frozen and pre-cooked.  Did not order for my son at home that does not like seafood.  I'm so tired of low quality restaurant food.  When did TGIFriday set the Gold Standard for restaurants?  I don't eat out anymore unless I can be sure that the food tastes better than what I make at home.  Hot and Juicy did not deliver value for your dollars.    {{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{AVOID}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}   PEACE!   DAVE"}
{"text":"So besides hnj being the best place in the world to eat seafood they have an awesome staff.  Including this clown shoe  PIMP C. Aka (Camille)  Lol always in a good mood and on top of everything. Every time I go in and see her at any of the locations I know I'm gonna get good service.  Thanks girlie see you later this week for my weekly fix!!!"}
{"text":"Best crawfish in all of LA, and definitely a top spot in the U.S. Hot N Juicy is infamous for being featured on food network tv shows and raved my celebrities, so I am lucky to have had the luxury of dining here, enjoying my favorite meal at one of the best speciality restaurants to offer. I ordered a few pounds of crawfish in their special garlic butter based sauce, as well clams, and blue crabs. Everything was delightful and we all enjoyed our seafood. Hot N Juicy was so good, I went every day that I was visiting Las Vegas & I purchased a T-Shirt that I adored. Definitely come here for great seafood and the warm friendly customer service.  P.S they will only seat you if your full party is there, which I don't mind since I am in the restaurant industry and it's totally understandable seeing that they often have a waitlist."}
{"text":"Busy day for them... busy means we all get meals and orders randomly delivered, my friend had his bag almost finished before we got our first order  ... food is always good so we don't care but today lemon pepper spice was off. Really yellow and not normal... ettoufe was bomb like always and shrimp green mussels always good. Service is always 50/50 here though"}
{"text":"Any place that makes me crave to come back is getting 5 stars from me!  I finally convinced a couple of friends to try the infamous Hot n Juicy for the first time.  None of us had been here before, but I am pretty sure all of us are returning soon!  We ordered two pounds of crawfish, and a pound each of shrimp and snow crab.  We opted for the Hot n Juicy sauce, medium spice.  The spice level of the sauce was right about on for us (although we may go hotter next time!), and the flavor was extremely good.  It was some sort of a garlic sauce that made sucking the juices out of these crustaceans so addicting.    The shrimp were by far our favorite.  Nice and big in size, and juicy.  They weren't that hard to peal really, with the heads on them.  The crawfish were also tasty, although there was a lot less meat in them (obviously).  I am not a big crawfish eater, but these were so damn good that I probably would get them again just for the experience of cracking them open!  The money paid for the crawfish versus how much meat you get might not be worth it to some, but the experience is worth it to me.  The blue crab legs were few, but large and extremely delicious!  I can't wait to come back, so Hot n Juicy is getting a 5 star review from me.  The waitresses are cute and friendly and they'll make sure you know how to crack those shellfish!  This place definitely deserves the A+ reputation that it has earned."}
{"text":"Bomb great atmosphere good food, the server mz. Laura made it a great time.. Fun b-day continues !!!! I had crawfish and snow crab and shrimp with the hot n juicy sauce uummm"}
{"text":"Seafood boils 15 minutes away from the strip? I'm there! Simple enough, choose your protein by the pound, your sauce, and the heat level. In any place that serves boils, I always go for crawfish and the sauce that they are known for. So I went with hot n juicy in medium, the sauce was everything! Ask for extra sauce on the side to dip your proteins in.  I also went with lemon pepper per recommendation, but I already knew it would be kinda boring ...and it was. So stick with hot n juicy! So happy that they had live crawfish that day, but they were real dinky... bummer.   As for the fried baskets, I recommend the soft shell crab. Skip the catfish cause the texture was too soft."}
{"text":"Stopped by for happy hour and appetizer. $2.50 well drinks including Margaritas is a great deal. As expected they weren't too strong but we're still good.  Had the fried catfish and sweet potato fries. Very good. I really enjoyed them. The catfish was tender and subtle. The breaking to fish ratio was just right. I recommend."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite place to get crawfish. I like this place better than Angry Crab. Their food always seems so fresh and they never disappoint me. I've been here many times before. It's a fun atmosphere and you can get messy with the food without getting judged! I've always had good service working here. Never had a problem. I love getting the crawfish or shrimp with the garlic butter sauce. A pound of crawfish is $12.99 and a pound of shrimp is $13.99. I normally get either 2lbs for myself. I recently got into their delicious oysters. They oyster either come in 6 or 12. It's super refreshing and I highly recommend getting it. I have to admit it's a little pricey but it's worth it! Definitely one of my favorite places if I'm in the mood for crawfish!"}
{"text":"Insanely good. I can't resist! I always get king crab, but the chicken wings and fries are good if you get a side of hot and juicy flavor and dip them. FIRE! I totally recommend this location because of the food, but the wait time has been nonexistent each time I have been here. Check them out if you are in the area."}
{"text":"So dang delish.   Our table had lobster, snow crab, chicken wings, fried shrimp, sweet potato fries, regular fries, corn, potatoes, and rice. Everything was so good! We are huge fans and will keep on coming back!  Their flavors are bolder than boiling crab and even their baby spice is hot. If you are a wimp for spiciness, definitely go with baby spice.  I personally like their wings with hot n juicy flavor and baby spice. Super good!  Good service. I think one of our Crab orders were forgotten, but they brought it as soon as we inquired and we're really friendly the whole time. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I will not be going back. Angry crab shack is by far & no question about it SO SO SO much better!!! The service and quality of food is below average. The server took forever to do anything, just to close out the check was over 20 minutes. The music was way to loud!! I couldn't even talk to my family members I had to yell. The ambiance was awful and not somewhere I would recommended to anyone. If you want awful service and bad heartburn because of the over seasoned low quality food then this is your place."}
{"text":"The food would have been great if michael our server would have educated us in the levels of hot l. We explained it was our first time at their establishment. We couldn't enjoyed it..but didnt. Dont get spicy!! went across the street for a burger."}
{"text":"I usually go to the other location closer to I-15 but my friend suggested this location...food was delicious but our server wasn't that good. She was slow and we had to keep asking for refills on our drinks mind you this location isn't that big. My friend didn't even get the rolls she ordered. We asked if we could split the check and she ended up charging me for a meal that I didn't order. If you're looking for good food with crappy service hen this is your spot!!"}
{"text":"Originally I gave 2 stars but it wasn't based on how delicious the food was but how bad the service was. Jillian, the asst. manager, reached out to me to give a second chance which I did. My husband and I had dinner last night and not only was the food amazing once again but the service was great!!! Our waitress was attentive and upbeat! She genuinely gave us A+ service! I can't wait to bring my mom be next time!  Thanks Jillian and Marc for caring about your customers!"}
{"text":"amazing food!!! I love the cajun spicy shrimp and the fried shrimp as well!! oh and of course the Cajun fries they are amazing on the side!! I love this restaurant, would highly recommend to people who like sea food"}
{"text":"Pretty decent cajun joint in Vegas.  The sauce is just as good as Boiling Crab, and the wait is not as bad.  We waited for about 30 mins on a Saturday night for 5 people.  The shrimp is better than the bay area.  It is much bigger and juicier.  Definitly will stop again when I am in Vegas when craving for some hot and spicy shrimp.  The wings are just okay.  The fries are really good.  One of the con of this place is that parking really sucks.  And it takes forever to get out."}
{"text":"Delicious Food and Great Staff! Love this place! Hats off to Andraya for awesome customer service!"}
{"text":"I was there on monday for a take out of crawfish and shrimp. And they was not fresh at all. I was expected live crawfish at this time of the year."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, the priority at this place is good food... I heard a lot about this place so my expectations were high when I got to Vegas. I didn't want to put the bib on but it was definitely a good idea...  What we had: Fried catfish Corn fritters Shrimp boil Crab legs Corn on the Cobb Fries Sweet potato fries  The only thing that I had that was not off the charts good were the fries, everything else was so good I can't wait to go back. Our waitress was funny an had no problem trading shots with 8 guys.  This place is now on my 'must do while in Vegas' list. This place is awesome before accounting for the relatively inexpensive prices. Add that in and this place is borderline 5 stars. If I have the same experience again I will bump this place up to 5 stars.  They don't have plates, but who cares? So it's not a first date place, or a place you go to prior to a club, but this place is awesome."}
{"text":"Overall, the food was pretty good. The service however was not the greatest. We had to wait close to thirty minutes for my order of shrimp to come out and another fifteen for my husband's fried catfish. It doesn't take that long to fry fish and fries. It was so disappointing. I'll have to take some time before I can come back."}
{"text":"I saw this on the travel channel and without that i would not have gone. But im glad i saw that episode because WOW.  My cousin and i went and had 1 pound of Hot & Juicy Shrimp- extra spicy, 1 pound of king crab legs$35 bucks. GREAT DEAL!   and the food was great, i would advise you to not wear dressy clothes due to the hands on food. U got to use your hands and remember your bib."}
{"text":"This was our first time here and everything was on point! We ordered 2lbs of clams, 2lbs of snow crab, 1lb of shrimp and a soft shell crab basket. All with hot and juicy seasoning! Everything was delicious! Can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"I have finally had the chance to check this place out and what a disappointment.  Let me start by saying... our waiter, Nick... DAMN. It was almost like he was fed up in being there and just didn't give a fck. Once we sat down, he came and yes... threw out menus in our face, threw sugar bags down on the table, and asked us you guys want anything to drink?! Daaaamn serious?!?!! Why Boo??!! WHY??! Wow okay... . Came back with our teas and took our orders.. that's the last time we saw his face.   It took numerous attempts to get a runner, server, whoever worked there to ask for refills, which finally was able to be refilled, but with regular tea when I had Raspberry. Nasty... The whole time we were there... our throats were like a desert and our drinks were empty.. so damn empty,  the melted ice made a few gulps of replenishment to get us through our meals. We had to ask for gloves, we had to ask again for our pepper and  limes on the side, which our server never brought, and we even had to ask the next table to please get their server's attention for us after she was done giving them their food orders, just so we could... Ask. Even our tools to crack open our crabs were not the right tools, but after trying to get a server's attention. It was more tiring to wave down a server than tear apart our meals. From the frustration on the service here, I tore the crab legs with my own bare hands and ate like an animal. Tearing it with my own straight teeth!!! Grrr!!! I ended up doing the.. break the shell with my fingers and gently wiggle wiggle the meat out. Several times I showed my great company that I conquered a looooong piece of crab meat Ha haaaa! But then she shows off her piece, which was thicker and longer than mine!!! Oh yeah?!??!!!! I had that Ooo impressed face and nodded my head. We entertained each other... But never once were we checked back upon to see how we were doing or we needed anything. It was literally the worst service for a fun-filled environment.   I heard their other new location has better service, but this experience makes me think twice to even want to give them my business.  The food was the only thing that made me want to give Any stars to this establishment. The sweet potato fries was excellent in texture and taste. The shrimp, crab, and side of sausage we ordered were full of spice and with the combination of asking limes on the side to make your own sauce.. it tasted refreshing, sweet, spicy, peppery, bitter, and ended with a great bite from the acidity of the limes. Don't forget to ask for those pepper and limes on the side.. makes a great impact with the flavors of the spices that were cooked in with the crab and shrimp. Even if you have to hunt someone down that worked there to get it! I will note that the food deserves high remarks. However, due to the lack of service we received here, it's unfortunate to give it such a low rating. But I must speak the truth and the service here was... non-existence. Damn, DAMN shame if you ask me. It ruined a good meal experience and for us to constantly try to get a server's attention is just bad news. We couldn't enjoy our food and it shouldn't be that way.  And for that reason alone... first and last time dining here. Wasn't so \"hot\" after all and that's the juicy part."}
{"text":"I love Hot N Juicy! I mostly come for the crawfish and shirmp!  However as of late, it seemed like the service level had gone down. A few servers just forget about their table.  I've had to get up and ask for them to come check on me multiplue times. And even had to get up and ask for my check.  However, as of last night, my faith was restored, thanks to Grace! Had the best service from Grace!! She's the epitome of a fantastic server! She's really sweet, funny, and constantly checked on my friends and I. I cannot thank Grace enough!"}
{"text":"Food is great! Service is better! Checked this place out with my husband. We've been wanting to try it for some time. Glad we did. From the moment we walked in the door, everyone was friendly and helpful in explaining what they served.  We ordered the \"Get your feet wet\" which offered Crawfish, Shrimp, Sausage, 2 corns and 2 potatoes. We ordered it with their Hot N Juicy Sauce - Baby Spice... Served in a bag, you dig in with your hands because this is truly finger licking good! Everything should be cooked in Hot N Juicy sauce!!! Great flavors. Looking forward to going back and trying it all again, including crab. Highly recommend trying!!!"}
{"text":"HOT & JUICY?  oh you meant  HOT AND BLOODY.  Two stars for the restaurant that doesn't set the bar.  Walked in, not greeted just looked at.  3 minutes pass and a server goes, \"Hi have you been served?\" OBVIOUSLY NOT.   Ordered to go by the bar. I ordered: 1/2 lb shrimp && 1/2 lb sausage  Rice Corn fritters Tartar sauce  *check out my videos and pics of the shrimp (not for the faint)  *the sausage was alright, thin slices  *i don't understand why you would dip the corn fritters with the ranch sauce. Who is the chef? Like corn fritters are sweet and then dip it in savory ranch sauce why? *tartar sauce is sour ehhhh    After seeing the shrimp by god all I tasted was blood.   Service was okay. I'm done. I'm going back to boiling crab."}
{"text":"Went here today and the crawfish were not only in season but HnJ definitely flew them in and hooked it up out here in the desert! The restaurant was its usual busy 90% occupied with parking hard to find in this Valley View & Spring Mountain plaza. My friends ate the crawfish and they were ginormous!  The shrimp were also huge as I took an extra pound home. Hot n Juicy mild sauce was on point.   The catfish and calamari were okay but this is to be expected from battered deep fried seafood. I honestly believe these guys are about equal to Cajun Crawfish as well as Boiling Crab. The sauce at this location has a little more taste than the others but they are close to equal."}
{"text":"Great place if you like it hot n spicy!!!  I ordered fresh oysters on a half shell which was great served over a platter of ice.  The fried catfish was great but I would probably not do the fried shrimp with it breaded.  The shrimp without the breading would probably be best.  Overall it was packed in there and the food was great!!!  I would definitely come back again and its perfect for small groups!"}
{"text":"Loved it! We had softshell crab, shrimp, and clams! I have to say the softshell crab especially was the best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Overall,  good experience.  We went there on Saturday around 1 pm and the hostess told us eta wait time of 15 minutes. The place was full and there was only one other party waiting before us.  We waited for about 20 minutes and our table was ready. I've been to boiling crab in cali several times,  so I was familiar with the drill but my party wasn't.  Our server Jazzmin right away asked us if this was our first time and kindly explained the drill and thoroughly went over each item on the menu and how much we should order.  We ordered half dozen oysters,  assorted shrimp (half lb Louisiana spicy,  pound hot and juicy mild,  and lemon pepper baby spice), corn,  and a catfish basket in case my girl doesn't like the spices on shrimp.  I'm not a huge fan of crawfish, so we skipped that.  When I visit my family in cali,  we always go to boiling crab and one of my favorite things is to order raw oysters as an appetizer before I start devouring my shrimp, so naturally I was looking forward to getting my Oyster first. I even asked the server if they could bring out the oysters before anything else and after she went to check with the kitchen and told us that it couldn't be done. I could've sworn oysters were on appetizer menu.... Anyway,  The first thing they brought out was the lemon pepper shrimp.  My daughter who can't eat spicy seasoning started digging in. Shortly after,  they started  bringing out other shrimp but still no oysters.  I asked the server if we could have our oysters asap as we ordered them for appetizer and she said she'd go check with the kitchen. She came back and told us oysters were still not ready.  By the time we were almost done with our shrimp,  they brought out the catfish basket.  The fish was hot, fresh,  and juicy and the side of sweet potato fries were also fresh.  My girl really like the lemon pepper shrimp,  so we ordered another pound and it came out reasonably quickly.  We were getting too full to finish the extra order of shrimp,  so we asked for a box.  By the time our server brought the box,  we were totally stuffed.  By this time, STILL no oysters.  It's not like our server forgot to put in my order,  she kept on checking with the kitchen every 5 minutes and I don't even know what the hold up was.  We ended up canceling our oysters but of course by the time another server brought our check,  we were still charged for the oysters. So additional 10 minutes or so spent unnecessarily to have the oysters taken out of my check.    Anyway overall everyone in my party was satisfied with the flavor and the amount of food ordered. I was bummed out about not getting my oysters and that's why I give 4 stars but by the time we were done,  I was so satisfactorily full,  it didn't bother me that much that I didn't get my appetizer.  People started pouring in by the time we were leaving  (around 2:30 pm on Saturday) so I think we made it just in time.  Shrimp was plump, seasoning was flavorful (except the Louisiana one.  I mean it was ok but wasn't the best), plenty of drink refill,  our server Jazzmin was attentive,  friendly,  fast,  and knowledgeable,  so overall,  a good experience for us."}
{"text":"We were first timers! We ordered the drool great price for what you get. We got the garlic butter and baby spice which was still spicy but good.   We also ordered an extra corn and potato that we didn't get till walking out. The manager ended up making it up to us by giving us a discount.  Next time we are in the area we will be back."}
{"text":"A good seafood boil place in Las Vegas. The sauces are very salty and full of garlic.  Just a warning the mild sauce is pretty hot so unless you are masochist or want your lips to burn off avoid the hot sauce. Service was good here waitress was fast on the soda refill."}
{"text":"Great food and great staff. Always get a side order on the extra spicy butter seasoning. It's awesome."}
{"text":"I'm not a big sea food person, but I came here with a group of friends and put my best foot forward. Everyone in my group loved their food, but the service and server Tiffany was absolutely ridiculous it felt like all we did was inconvenience her at every turn. If it wasn't for Em our new server,  our experience would have been a lot worse for me and my group."}
{"text":"Service was slow and inconsistent.  Brought the main meal first and the sides 10-15 mins later. Had to remind waitress about the rice I ordered and they stated they ran out of rice for the night. The reason might be they were closing but still have to be considerate about the  late night cravers. They had to suggest dinner rolls to exchange for the rice."}
{"text":"If I were to rate this place based on the food alone, I would give it a 4.5.. The shrimp was really good with the signature hot and juicy sauce, even better than what I've had at boiling crab *gasp!! My friends and I shared deep fried soft shell crab, catfish, and fries, which were all really yummy.  What brought it waaaay down for me was the HORRIBLE service! We went to eat there on a Saturday evening, so we were expecting it to be really busy, but it wasn't. Thought that would be a good thing because our server would probably have more time to be attentive, but NO! My friend's mouth was on fire from the spicy sauce and had to ask for a coke refill 4 times before a different server finally came and refilled her cup, I had to ask for water 3 times, my other friend's plastic bib broke and she had to repeatedly ask for another before someone finally brought her a new one.  When I received my bag of shrimp, there was a hole in it and juices were leaking everywhere. I politely asked the server if I could have another bag just to place the one I already had inside because I didn't want to lose all the sauce to my table, and he replied with a horrible attitude, telling me I wouldn't need one because it would be messy anyway. I then replied with, \"Can you just get me a bag like I asked for please?\" And he proceeded to throw his hands in the air, say \"Fine,\" in a very sarcastic tone, and just threw the bag on the table. Um, excuse me?? First of all, I wanted to save my delicious sauce for my rice, not for licking off the f*cking table, DICK. I wish I ordered crab instead of shrimp so I could use the claws to attack him.  Overheard the tables next to ours complaining about the bad service and the unnecessary attitudes as well. I hope the management at this establishment figures out a way to properly train their employees to be helpful, attentive, and polite. Until that happens, I won't be returning to Hot and Juicy."}
{"text":"Great spot for peel-n-eat seafood. Be sure to get their classic \"Hot n Juicy\" seasoning! It's messy but a blast with friends!   Pros: Great cajun (rare in AZ), fresh seafood, not too crowded  Cons: Blarring rap music makes it feel like a club (said they couldn't change the volume)"}
{"text":"Food was amazing one of the best places in Las Vegas first time every going my Uber driver told me about it an I definitely had to check it out An she did not steer me work the atmosphere was great the food was awesome."}
{"text":"First of all MAJOR props to manager Emily! We were walking around Tempe Festival and saw the signage and our group was wow sounds good lets go have lunch there instead of eating at the food trucks as our orginal plan. I of course was worried with the festival crowd we would have a wait but we got seated right away which was nice. Emily came up to our table right away and explain the whole and I mean the whole menu and all the different sauces and levels of spicy ness. We quickly decided and placed our order. The food came out very quickly and HOT which is a good thing for me as lately I keep getting cold food when I eat out for some reason. :(  Emily was very personable talking with us and really seem to enjoy her job. Her enthusiasm really was nice. Unfortunely she got called away to go to the Glendale location due to the location being overwhelm by the Final Four. She made sure to come over to our table on her way out and explained what had happened and that she had to leave but 3 other waitress would help us during the rest of the meal. Now for the bad experience ...the other 3 waitress had  no where near the professional and plesantness of Emily. The first waitress completely ignored us and didn't even bother to check on our table even as she helped the tables next to us. The second waitress acted like we were bothering her by asking for more water as our water had sat empty for awhile, could almost hear her roll her eyes. The third waitress was just fine not good not bad just took care of the bill.  We throughly enjoyed ourselves and the food, just wish we could of had Emily the whole time."}
{"text":"If you need your spicy seafood fix, this is the place. Great food, fresh, service and prices are reasonable"}
{"text":"This is a must go to place if you visit Vegas and want some good crab. I lived down the street from this establishment and never went there until I was relaxing one day channel surfing and saw Adam Richman speaking on it.. Everyone I tell to go or take;never NOT, want that experience when in Vegas...."}
{"text":"I don't like their popular hot n juicy mix... Maybe it's because I ate boiling crab first ages ago and got used to their mix. Maybe. But this isn't good... Really. Maybe because I chose shrimp? Nawww don't think that made a difference. And from what everyone says the mild was more medium heat.  Price... It's more than what so. Cal. Places may charge but I'm thinking it's the price to get the seafood there... In the desert. But then again there is plenty of AYCE shrimp everywhere.    The only pluses to my meal is the sweet potato fries and service. That's all sorry."}
{"text":"Tasty crawfish. Good service. Reminds me of the boiling crab in Dallas. The Hot and juicy seasoning(which is a combination of all seasonings) is delicious. Also the spicy is just right, I don't recommend the extra spicy unless you want to pay for it later lol. We ordered the get your feet wet and it was a lot of food. We almost didn't finish it. But it was a great deal for 2 people. I highly recommend this place for a great meal that if you like shellfish."}
{"text":"Been here several times...won't be back.  Ordered mild and made sure to say really wanted mild.  I thought I was gonna die.  Waitress suggests that she will bring some extra butter to cool it down.  Guess that's how they up sell butter at $1 per small serving.  Horrid.  Now I'm sick and will probably spend the night with my toilet!   I've ordered mild before and it was never like that!!! Oh and more than one server came over to offer more butter to calm the heat. Ya no!"}
{"text":"We came back specifically to see server \"Cheyenne\" last time was the first time we ever been to Hot N Juicy she was so helpful and very informative to make our first visit an amazing experience!!! The food is fantastic, great atmosphere all the staff here is Super friendly we will definitely be coming back and recommending Hot N Juicy to our friends and family!!!"}
{"text":"What a unique, fun, and delicious way to enjoy seafood!  For those that can't stand their food looking at them, beware.  The shrimp are whole and the heads, legs, tails, and shells must be removed before consumption.  I'd get over it quickly, because the seafood is delicious and I don't think you could go wrong with any of the sauce/spice combos.  Grab a cab, make the trip, and enjoy some of the best seafood in the area!"}
{"text":"The food is SOOOOOOOOO good! The female employee with all the tats and short hair is very friendly and pretty good eye candy as well! The other staff members are cool too. Lol."}
{"text":"I love this place....coming from Houston where u can get crawfish anywhere...here makes me feel lk home!!!! Hot and Spicy seasoning...spicy soooooo good!!! Add cajun fries YUM.... Ask for Alexis or AJ..... :)"}
{"text":"Let me just start by saying how is it possible that people are complaining about a SMELL of a seafood restaurant?! Get over it. Anyways, loved my experience here! Great relaxed atmosphere, love the spacious booths and all the TVs! Happy hour has a buy a beer get the next one for a penny deal! Boiled garlic shrimp and snow crab legs lemon pepper medium were so delicious. Prices were reasonable. Valentina took care of us and did such an amazing job  will be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome experience! Karol with a K took care of us! She definitely made our lunch experience better! Had the \"spicy\" shrimp \"hot n juicy\" style! Potatoes well well cooked the sausage was awesome too! Had the best tasting oysters I've had in phx so far! We also had A couple off beers and my girlfriend a couple of sangrias.  Thanks to Karol and her recommendations we had an awesome time. I really enjoy and  appreciate a dedicated worker that loves their job and specially the food they serve!"}
{"text":"ok so my grandpa was a fisherman and my grandmother was the best cook in town (i know i know everyones grandma is the best cook) so i grew up on fresh seafood i mean straight from the sea to the pot to my plate everyday so ill admit im a little snobby when it comes to seafood (its the only thing im snobby about i promise)......and i must say this is the best place i have been so far in Vegas ......its always packed and its because its goood.... whenever me and the bf go we order a pound of craw fish 2 pounds of snow crab legs and maybe a pound of shrimp and i always get the hot n juicy sauce and bf gets Louisiana and as many corona's it takes to keep the burn under control lloll.....anywho this is one of the places i want to have my last meal on earth....their menu is not extensive wich is good ....and you should def be a seafood lover to go their because they have any obligatory burgers or chicken fingers for people who may have tagged along with someone else but doesn't actually like seafood....the atmosphere is very casual they serve your food in plastic bags and you get a bib lloll  and i would suggest not wearing something you love or plan to go out in because you will smell like garlic and crawfish when you leave lloll and buy some lemons on the way home and take them in the shower with you it will help get the smell off...all in all though the food is fresh and extremely good they have beer and its always crowded but ive never waited more than 10 min for a table still....to me it cant get much better.....me and my roommates love this place so much we are LITERALLY looking to rent our next house closer to hot n juicy ...yess in my opinion it is that good :)"}
{"text":"I went with some friends the other night and I enjoyed my dinner... I like that there are several options and spice levels to your choices and they are thoughtful to give a bib and gloves... decent boil but I am a hard judge since I am from New Orleans and know the freshness of Gulf seafood. But for a desert restaurant I was happy and will be back!!!   One critique is there is no hard liquor!!! Beer and wine offerings are ok but I wanted a drink with my meal."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend and didn't know what to expect when I walked in. First off the table was covered in plastic with a roll of paper towels on the side. The hostess gave us plastic bibs. I knew this was going to get messy. You order your food by the lbs, mostly seafood.   I was quite amazed at how delicious everything was. You really get hands on and messy as you open up a bag of seasoned shrimp, crab legs or crawfish. First time experiencing this and I would love to try this place again."}
{"text":"Hot, juicy, messy. The service is slllllloooooowwwww which sucks. I wouldnt being kids here again since their food was the last to come out. Better for taking the inlaws."}
{"text":"Every time I visit Las Vegas, this is a MUST STOP and I highly recommend that you try coming here. The atmosphere is laid back and the service is always very good. There is a list of seafood to choose from. I always stick to the crawfish in which I order 2lbs. My girlfriend orders crawfish and snow crab. Both are delicious and full of so much flavor. I recommend the hot n juicy flavor when picking your flavor. I usually stick to the medium spice which is plenty for me. If you love Cajun or spicy food, this is the place fort you and I highly recommend them."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday for my birthday celebration. I'll have to say I'll be back more often. We had a table of 12 and I was a little worried that we would experience what happened last time. Although one of my guests shrimp was raw, they accommodated us by removing it from the bill.  Waitress was extremely nice and patient. If only I got her name!!! I  had a very good time celebrating my birthday there. They even sang Happy Birthday!!!!"}
{"text":"The seafood and seasonings are good, no complaints on the food but awful, slow service for the price. You guys really need to bump your service. You guys are charging top dollar, make it a better experience."}
{"text":"A-Okay  I wouldn't go out of my way to come here again but I wouldn't rule it out if it was a convenient choice and my group was large. We had a party of 8, ordered lots of things and just shared with the table. The service was friendly and attentive, the prices weren't bad, and the place was pretty clean inside even though both locations on this street are in raunchy strip malls, and this location has very little parking.   Corn Fritters: hands down the best thing we had here  Cat fish: yummy corn meal battered and seasoned perfectly Calamari: lightly battered fried golden okay on the seasoning Cajun Fries: a delicious smoldering fire in my mouth Plan Fries: Blah Juicy Cajun med spicy, and lemon pepper pounds of shrimp: okay very large juicy shrimp that were fresh, but they should marinate the shrimp in their many sauces or seasonings for a while before boiled or use more seasoning while boiling the sauce just didn't stick making the shrimp pretty bland.  Corn: Pretty good balanced the shrimp, although my mother didn't like that they put her piece in the juicy Cajun sauce instead of on the side. (simple fix if we return she can ask for it on the side so no biggie) Mozzarella sticks: okay nothing to write home about, jar marinara sauce   Sausage: Good and spicy I enjoyed the slices that were in the juicy Cajun sauce with the shrimp Sweet Potato Fries: I'm just not a fan of these but a few people at the table that are a fan said they were standard  So the reason this place has 3 stars:   1. Food was just okay I've been to places just like this before with kicked up flavor with more menu options  2. I don't drink soda and all they offer is soda and beer, no lemonade no iced tea (even though the website says they have iced tea, major fail for me)??? I was puzzled by this pretty much every restaurant I go to offers at least one non soda option 3. The timing for their food is completely retarded our food came out at least 8 minutes apart from each other like they have one boiling pot and one fryer.. the shrimp came out first (not our appetizers?) then the calamari dinner then the appetizers, then after 10 more minutes the 3 catfish dinners so half the table was done eating when the last 3 meals came out once again major fail!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Hot N Juicy for awhile!  Since the first one opened and my friend/coworker Elise introduced me back in 2007 so I figured it's time I write a review.    It's pretty much my main place to go when I'm craving Cajun.  I've been to New Orleans before and dare I say, this is just as good and as authentic!!  The price is decent, I mean it will be at least in the teens for anything, it is seafood.  If it's your first time here then you must get a 2 lbs. bag of craw fish with the Hot N Juicy special flavor mix."}
{"text":"hot and juicy special shrimp with corn is the only thing i order every time i come here! a few tips i've learned from my previous visits.. wear clothes you don't mind smelling like shrimp in. so definitely don't go in your best outfit and if you have anything to do after your meal! lastly, lemons lots of them, soak your hands in the them to get rid of the shrimpy smell. couple things that are a bummer, parking and no phone reservations."}
{"text":"I love this place been here twice now and the shrimp and crawfish are amazing if you don't mind getting your hands dirty and love sea food check this place out."}

{"text":"Went here for my first time last night. After hearing from so many friends, family, and coworkers how awesome this place was I decided to go and take some family from out of town. I am originally from the east coast so I am a bit spoiled on GREAT seafood. All the people telling me to go here are all from California or some other pacific coast state. Now I can understand why someone from the desert or west coast would like this place because they don't know any better but let me tell you, THIS PLACE WAS AWFUL. I could not believe how bland the seafood was especially with all the rave reviews of the sauces this place uses. The sauces are all extremely watered down and they do not penetrate to the actually food itself just the shells. We ordered 2 pounds of shrimp, 2 pounds of crawfish (which we were told were not fresh but frozen!!!), a dozen oysters(SO BAD), and calamari. We tried various sauces and spice levels and we just agreed that this place was a lot of hype for nothing. I have been to the Gulf many times and have had the type of food they are TRYING serve and the food here is just not even close. I did ask the manager where the seafood comes from and he told me ASIA mostly(FYI, seafood restaurants that get their shellfish from Asia are normally awful plus it's the cheapest possible shellfish on the market!!!). I guess I understand why the location is in China town and why most of the people at the restaurant were Asian. In addition to the food tasting awful, the service was very poor. Staffed with a lot of girls who seemed to be working their first serving job. We had to light signal flares just to get another beer. All the wait staff was talking about some party after work that they couldn't wait to get to and they kept grouping together to discuss rather than tend to the customers and lots of people were frustrated. Don't get me wrong, I can totally see how people who have never had decent seafood (mostly from buffets) would love this place as it's just like people who say the best sushi is at Ra Sushi because they just don't know any better. But if you have been to cities on the Gulf of Mexico and have had Gulf seafood or are from the east coast and have had great seafood then please pass this place up because all your friends telling you how awesome this place is have never truly had awesome seafood."}
{"text":"Always fresh and tasty !! staff is super nice and everyone works as a team to make sure you have everything you need. Food is delicious hence the price increase  will always bring family here :)"}
{"text":"Selena is amazing I love her!Food is amazing! Staff was fun and great!drinks were strong Luke I love em!"}
{"text":"This location is fantastic.  The service is great and the seafood is delicious.  Fun atmosphere and an all around messy good time."}
{"text":"This is definitely off the beaten path if you are one of those types of people that live for The Strip and all of its foo-foo overpriced eateries. Located about two miles from the strip, give or take a few feet, Hot N Juicy is located in Vegas' \"Chinatown\", although I saw more Vietnamese and Korean joints than I did Chinese.   First of all......if you are waiting outside the front door, BEWARE THE RAMP LOCATED BY THE DISABLED PARKING SPOT! Its made out of the same asphalt that the rest of the parking lot is made out of, and the wife didn't see it, and she ate shit............Please be careful.   With that being said, we went this past Sunday, (05/29/11), and it was jam packed. Right away, they let us know that they just opened up another location down the street, but we politely declined and toughed out the wait. For our party of 10, which we said didn't mind having split up if it got us in faster, the wait time was only about 30-40 minutes, and they told us it would be about as much.   When we were seated, the waitress was kind enough to explain the flavors and levels of spiciness and she was right on. Getting right into it, we tried the shrimp (lemon pepper and garlic butter, both mild), the fried catfish basket with fries, the corn on the cob, and the steamed rice.   SHRIMP-   Big, fat, juicy, and oh so tasty. Unlike other places similar to this one, the sauces they used for both types we tried were kind of thin in terms of thickness (?), but VERY, VERY, VERY FLAVORFUL. We've been to places that the sauce is almost sandy or chalky, but here, it is like a nice shrimp stock, and we easily and most enjoyably poured it all over our steamed rice, which made it that much better!   CATFISH-   The catfish basket comes with fries. Fries, who can F those up? Not these guys! Crisp, crunchy, and salty. Perfect the way a fry should be. The catfish, perfectly cooked, comes in a nice cornmeal type of coating that adds a little extra crunch. Only problem is, they only give you about a fillet and a half, if that. I've been to places where they give you almost 3 fillets and that would have to be my only bitch about the fish.   SIDES-   Corn on the cob was awesome. Boiled, Buttery, sweet, and not overcooked. Simplicity at its finest.   Steamed Rice- ditto. Simple, yet delicious.   OVERALL EXPERIENCE-   The wait was expected. It was out the door just like other people said. Waitresses were very helpful, but with the exception of the first refill, were slow on the next couple. As far as ordering more food, they were spot on. I'd come back over here for sure, and I'd bring my friends too. If you don't mind a wait, or taking the roads less traveled, be brave and head this way!"}
{"text":"The service and food were great! And much better than the Hollywood location! We had two servers taking care of our area and they worked together, as a team, very well. We also tried a local competitor a few days later and Hot N Juicy was far better experience. We didn't have to wait for a table, although they did have a solid influx of customers throughout the night. Our servers were very attentive! Oh, and they have gloves which was very nice because you are tearing open sauce covered shrimp!"}
{"text":"Seated very quickly in a packed night. Service is consistent and fairly fast, considering it was busy service is as expected. Overall satisfied and pleasant."}
{"text":"We came here pretty late and the restaurant accepted us for the remaining open hour. With a party of 14 I was impressed that they were able to keep their service consistent and very professional. The food was GREAT and the tremendous shout to their crew. I will be coming back to this location, highly recommend."}
{"text":"Heaven in a bag!!!!   Wow. I'm a huge seafood lover and just had to try this place out.  Best shrimp I've ever had!  The garlicky Cajun sauce is TO DIE FOR!!!  I could eat it on anything!  I do, however have a HUGE complaint - their service.  We came around 4:30 before the rush hour dinner crowd arrived.  We were seated and our order was taken.  Fast forward 45 minutes and the place started to fill up and people who arrived 20-30 minutes after us placed their orders and were already eating and we still didn't even have our drinks!  We beckoned a server over (because we didn't know who our waiter/waitress was since 3 different people had come to our table) and asked why we haven't yet been tended to.  She looked into it and said that our orders had not been put into the computer so they were going to discount our tab to compensate and that a manager was going to come speak to us about it.  Soon after our meals were served, however, it was delivered to us piece-meal.  We had to remind her twice what items we were missing.  While we were dining, no one checked on us during our meal so we had to continue to flag her down to get refills on our drinks.  No manager had come, as promised, and when our bill came, it was not discounted and once again we had to remind her that no one came to discuss the bill with us and that it was not discounted either.  Thank GOD the food was amazing because if I were to base my review on service alone, this place would receive zero stars.  I could probably give it closer to 5 stars but bad service taints ones eating enjoyment and needless to say the food probably would have been that much better had I not been so upset about the subpar service."}
{"text":"I love shrimp boil and I am a real Boiling Crab enthusiast, so I had high hopes for this place especially after seeing this place on Man Vs. Food. The most egregious offense was the fact that they ran out of crawfish. Who wants to go to a seafood boil spot that is out of crawfish. Unfortunately I've got to deduct a star. Now to the food, I ordered the hot and juicy shrimp medium spicy, mussels hot and juicy style, Cajun fries, and fried calamari.  The Cajun fries were just fries with seasoning thrown on them. I didn't like them very much and I wouldn't recommend them to anyone.  2/5 stars  The fried calamari were small and forgettable. I will stick to the boil from now on. 1/5 stars.  The boil was great! The shrimp boil was a great blend of seasonings and none of the different components over powered the others. It wasn't too salty or garlicky like Boiling Crab. This place really does seafood right.  4/5 stars.  The conclusion: This is a wonderful little gem of a seafood place. I plan to come back for crawfish boil soon, so I plan to update my review."}
{"text":"My recollection of this place is good. They have wonderful crawfish and it's juicy, flavorful, and tasty! The service is good, the waitress was very patient and helpful for my mother and I, who were first timers.  Oh, and their andouille sausage and rice, what great sides! My mom loved their catfish.   This place was a hit and it looked like it gets crowded pretty quick so.... ! Get there the sooner the better!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the Shrimp, It had excellent flavor!  If you buy a bag to take home, it is even better the next day!"}
{"text":"Omg this place is delicious!!!!! My boyfriend had a crawfish Louisiana style, extra hot and I had the snow crab legs hot and juicy extra hot. The sauce was amazing!!!!! I couldn't get enough even after my mouth was on fire. Also the well drinks are only $2.50. They don't have a full bar but at those prices, I'm not complaining. The service needed some work but other than that, great place! Will definitely be back for more!!!"}
{"text":"This place hits the spot when it comes to crawfish. We went to the original location in Chinatown, and probably for the best as the one on the strip would have been packed. We managed to beat the crowd at this location, so don't get me wrong, there was a line around noon. The crawfish was delicious swimming in all that butter and garlic flavor, and that's what makes it good. Other places will advertise garlic butter as a seasoning choice, but it's actually being mixed in oil, garlic and Cajun seasoning so that you can't tell that it's not butter. Order corn and potatoes on the side and it comes in a separate bag soaked in its own butter bath. Definitely coming back whenever we can."}
{"text":"I can't wait to go back again.  Heard a lot about this place from my coworker and finally checked it out.   I ordered 1lb hot and juicy (flavor) mild shrimp! I was too full. I got buttered corn. Its fun to just get down and dirty and start peeling away and leaving your mess on the table.   Been hearing a lot about \"boiling crab\" in SF so my cousins said its just like it.   Our server was very nice. It took a little while to get your order.  Our sweet potato fries did take forever and then it was burnt so we returned them.   A great place for large parties. We did go on a sunday and we had to wait maybe 20 minutes. It was busy. Maybe this was the reason for our order taking a little while. I\"ll just have to see the 2nd time around = 0)"}
{"text":"This is a late review, but I thought I'd do one anyways.  Went here during this past summer (2012) and my boyfriend and I loved it, well I'd say he loved it more than me. We were on vacation in Vegas for a week and we ended up coming here for dinner twice (on our first night there as well as our third).  The wait can be a little long, but totally worth the wait. Living in Hawai'i we have a huge assortment of seafood, but it's pricey. When we saw how much it cost for a pound of king crab legs, we were kind of surprised because it's cheaper, and I'd say, reasonable.   If you're not into getting your fingernails dirty, then this might not be the place for you, although they do provide you with gloves and a whole roll of paper towels to clean yourself up. Aside from that, I'd give this place 5 stars because I had an awesome experience, both times."}
{"text":"This was not my first time at Hot N Juicy but, as always they delivered! I love how big the shrimp are and the flavor is always on point. I get the hot N Juicy mild because they don't skimp on the spice! I also like the corn fritters and I always add half a dozen sausages and two corn to my bag of shrimp! Trust me you will not regret it! Do prepare to get a little messy and to work for your food de-shelling so just be comfortable with whoever your going with... maybe not first date restaurant....It is a little pricy depending on what you order but, I continue to go back time and time again! You will too!"}
{"text":"While visiting Vegas for the umpteenth time we were on the hunt for something fun and different. This place fit the bill perfectly. We knew we wanted some hot peel and eat shrimp and some fried fish. We got a pound of shrimp with mild Louisiana spices which was a perfect blend for a shrimp boil. Just the right amount of spice and each shrimp was a decent size. We also got a 4 piece catfish basket with Cajun fries. Fish was good we only had one piece that had the cornmeal breading falling off a little... no biggie. OK, now if you need to order something on the side, definitely get the corn fritters. Little nuggets of fried corn love with a ranch dipping sauce. These are to die for. The service was attentive and filled our iced teas constantly. They had frequent check ins and greeted everyone who entered. Looking around you can see everyone splitting their time well between chatting and getting hands on there shellfish. We will definitely visit again in the future and bring friends."}
{"text":"You like spice? you like dirty hands? you like casual? you want to be blown out of this world? This place is it. It's sooooooooooo good and dirty.  Your hands will be filled with sticky sweet goodness as you tear of the shrimp and whatever you find in the bag. If there was a spoon i'd scoop it all out, heck i should have just drank the gravy since i have my plastic apron on.  The gravy tastes even better when rice added to it.   Forget all the other sides, just order your crawfish and shrimp and slurp/peel away.   Hot and Juicy, Good and Messy. Now that's my kind of food."}
{"text":"Food was a 4, service was a 2, so you get a 3!   PS: change the oil in your fryer a little more often."}
{"text":"BUGS IN THE FOOD!!?? BE CAREFUL!!   I used to really enjoy hot n juicy crawfish, but after finding what turned out to be dragonfly larvae in my food (posted photos)...I can't ever go back... it's just disgusting. This was a to-go order and there was a FULL sized large  bug in my food that I just happened to catch, who knows if there were more broken bits of other bugs in it. I'm sickened to think that I had already eaten half of the bag before I found it or what I might of eaten before since I've gone here a few times! I've even brought my boyfriend and mother praising how good it was and now I feel guilty of what they might have eaten too.   This place cost too much to find bugs in your food!! CHECK YOUR FOOD CLOSELY!! THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE!!"}
{"text":"Fine dining doesn't always have to be about posh surroundings and expensive dishes.  Sometimes, if the quality of the food is high and the uniqueness of the selections are compelling, the fact that you are sitting at a picnic table with a disposable tablecloth (and no plates BTW) doesn't factor into the equation.  In a town like Vegas where everything on the strip now costs an arm and a leg (or two), finding this alternative fine dining establishment just a $10 cab ride away was a pleasure.  Hot N Juicy Crawfish is a picnic table throw your food on the table type place that serves seafood by the pound.  Mussels, clams, shrimp, crab, and - of course - crawfish.  Just good quality ingredients, professionally steamed with your choice of toppings.  You can also add in some corn on the cob, potatoes and other sides just to fill out your plate.  My party tried a mix of the food with their spicy topping.    They have four tiers of spice and we chose the second to the top.  Be forewarned that the spice - while fantastically good - will bite you.  I fancy myself a spice aficienado that can handle more than most.  At first bite, the spicy didn't seem that hot.  Over time (like in the next 10 minutes), i had sweat pouring off my brow.  I felt like Nixon at a presidential debate.  If I had to do it again, woulda chose the medium just so i wouldn't have to immediately head to the hotel and take a shower.  If you, like me, at some point just guest bored of the strip and need a change - Hot N Juicy is a good find just a short drive away.  There are multiple locations in Vegas - this one in particular is located in the Chinatown area."}
{"text":"I heard great things about this place. We got the combo with sausage,shrimp,crawfish and king crab legs. We tried the serious hot and juicy sauce. Service was not bad. Its pricy but worth every penny. We got alot for our money. I would come back"}
{"text":"i really use to like this place I wanted to spot by for a quick bite to eat so I got there chicken strips  and fries may I say horrible nasty i will never order chicken strips from them again  fries was ok but i cant get over the chicken do not order them."}
{"text":"Delicious, really spicy. Even their mild has kick.  great for me bad for grandmas.  Sorry mamu...  I love this spot.  Always get corn on the cob.  And get messy with it."}
{"text":"SOOOOOOO goooood!!! Most of the places that have been on tv don't live up to the hype, but Adam Richman definately got it right when he gave this place the thumbs up!!!  One warning: it is VERY messy!!! Make sure you don't have ANY cuts in your fingers before you start eating (They do have gloves, but it's just not as much fun using them!) - other than that, you can't really go wrong with ANYTHING on this menu!  We always get crawfish with the HotNJuicy Special- with NO spice... We do like spicy food in our family, but even the mild has a pretty strong kick that does dull the yummy-ness of the sauce! Make sure you get a bowl of rice and order some extra sausages to eat with that extra sauce!  NOT the best place for hungry kids- we were able to get our girls some french fries & soda, but they got pretty frustrated trying to peel their own shrimp/wait for us to peel shellfish for them... and the craqfish creeped them out! (lol) But they ended up getting hapy meals on the way back to the hotel!  So for the best experience, leave the kids at home and go expecting a wait that will be well worth it!"}
{"text":"My friend loves this place, every time she's in vegas, this place is a must for her. so we finally get to try out this place. i hate the parking, some stupid bitch jacked my spot, so i ended up parking on the side. anyways, the wait was less than 20 minutes on a saturday night for 4 people. we were seated, the atmosphere was nice, different from the usual cf places i go to in socal, and it's so weird because the waiters/waitress are caucasians (i'm used to asians) haha. anyways my bf and i order 1 1/2 of shrimp, medium with their hot n juicy special (it wasn't any kind of spice at all, shrimp was huge), chicken wings (it was good, nothing special), cajun fries (meh... didn't enjoy it much, not crispy), and a corn (no bueno ): i was pretty sad about it).   service: not bad, had to ask for stuff, and when we ordered more stuff, they kinda forgot about it, but it wasn't  a long wait..  overall, i would go back, im planning to try the one that open in orange county some day... (:"}
{"text":"Ate at spring mnt locafion 6months ago.filthylittle place. Poorly lit food about average service below average. Very smelly like sewage. Ridin dirty restaurants this is one of the dirtiest in Vegas. Heard good things about the eastern location. Went there to eat horrible spice is inconsistent the waitress forgot our food like 3 different times they didn't get the order right at all not by the end of the night. My king crab which I paid $27 a pound for was cold inside on some and overl cook and mushy on others. anybody you write a good review about these places is not a qualified diner. They probably don't eat out much money do they probably eat somewhere like Long John Silvers. This is a horrible place at both locations completely rotten service with super poor quality food"}
{"text":"Great seafood place. Be careful with the spice levels though. Things can get really hot. We had shrimp, crawfish and mussels, everything was well cooked, nicely seasoned. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"My girl and I stopped in to have lunch and we absolutely loved the food and atmosphere. We ordered shrimp, crab legs and oysters  we were being helped by Rene and Harmon and had such a great experience. Will definitely go back when I'm in town"}
{"text":"My bestfriend brought me and my boyfriend here when we went to visit her in vegas..shes always talking about how good this place was so we had to try it.  amongst the three of us we got 3lbs of crawfish- mild hotness, 2lbs of shrimp, one order of calamari, and an order of cajun fries. we got the same sauce for the crawfish and shrimp, which was DEEEELICIOUS!! honestly, i liked their sauce more than the boiling crab, and what's even better is that THERE'S NO 2-3 HOUR WAIT!! unlike boiling crab, no matter what day of the week or what time of the day, there will ALWAYS be a wait. once we got into this restaurant, the waitress asked us how many and seated us within minutes. if you like garlic, this is the place to go, their sauce is thick and flavored with garlic, it was just perfect.  if youre ever in vegas, you should definitely give this place a try."}
{"text":"My first crawfish experience and it was so much fun!  Initially we went to the other location but the wait was too long, so they directed us to this location.  We waited maybe 5 more mins and then were seated.  The menu offers a variety of seafood in different flavors and spices.  We ordered the crawfish in Hot and Juicy flavor in a medium spicy level and shrimp in the Lemon Pepper flavor, also a medium spicy level and two pieces of corn.    The food came out quickly and we put on our bibs and got to cracking.  I've never eaten a crawfish before so it was interesting.  It seems like a lot of work for not so much to eat.  But it was fun nonetheless.  After awhile, the spices got too spicy for me (on a medium level).    Of the two flavors, I definitely like the lemon pepper better.  But the best part of the meal...the corn!!"}
{"text":"Had a little bit of an upset stomach. Good flavor.  Don't order any of their sodas..coompletely flat. I would bring a bottle of ur favorite soda and ask for a cup of ice.  Service wise...you can tell majority of the workers don't like being there."}
{"text":"We went here prior to the Monday night football game.  We went here because everywhere else was busy accept this place. Now I know why.  First, the restrooms were disgusting, dirty and no soap.  We tried  to order vodka tonic  but they don't carry top shelf brands so we would settled with the vodka they offer.  Then they tell us, we don't carry tonic.  Okay, maybe the food was good.  Ordered king crab legs, mussels and oysters.  Not very great food.  I will never go here again.  This was our first and last. Not sure it will stay open.  When your restrooms are disgusting, i didn't feel to confident in the quality of the food. My wife and i were pretty disappointed and grossed out."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of crawfish, but I'd choose this place over boiling crab. The sauces are better."}
{"text":"Service was horrible, craw fish wasn't worth the money. Meal not served all at once. Half our party of 8 did not get their food until after the other was finished. All in all I give it a minus one star, if you went that lw. Refills of bev r ages was non existent."}
{"text":"Heard a lot about this place from friends prior to visiting Las Vegas and was very excited to try it. We had a party of 6 and we were seated upstairs. We were greeted by a nice San Diegan transplant and he told us about the popular things on the menu and what to order. My sister and I got 2 alcohol beverages which tasted like juice. Our waitress was very nice and sweet and the best thing was the fries and our waiter who brought our drinks out. The catfish was very and the fries were crispy but had a little too much salt for my taste. Also we told Josh that the drinks did not taste like it had any alcohol, in which he told us he has heard that before.. he apologized and asked the manager if he could take it off our bill and that person said no. So in all we paid for drinks that were horrible with no taste and dry seafood. I would definitely not come back to this establishment."}
{"text":"We always stop by Hot N Juicy while we're in Vegas. We've always had mediocre experiences, but come back solely for the food. This past visit, we waited for about 5-10 minutes for a table - not bad at all. Upon observation, I can tell the clientele is completely different from other places I've been and that could be one of the main reasons why service isn't so great here, which is a bummer.   I'm almost certain our server was new or he was just overwhelmed. We always stick to boiled foods when we come to these types of places, but we ended up opting for some Cajun Wings & Fries with our fresh crawfish. While ordering with him, he asked us how spicy we wanted the fries and we said Mild.   Our crawfish came out and was delivered by another employee. When our server came around to ask how everything was, we asked about the wings and he said, \"Oh sure, how spicy would you like the fries?\" I knew he had forgotten to place the order, but when I told him we had already ordered it, he recovered and said \"Oh yeah, it should be right out.\"  We saw a basket of wings and fries go to the table behind us and beside us - and both were seated and ordered after us. So that confirmed our order was forgotten. No big deal - we get that it happens, but own it. Our server definitely avoided our table until the order arrived. Wings arrived and they were nice and crispy, but T-I-N-Y. A complete joke of a basket for $10.99.   Also, save yourself from drinking tap water that has a funky taste and smell to it and order a soda or beer. The bill explicitly states \"Tap Water\". LOL and dumping lemon wedges in it definitely doesn't mask the taste/smell either.   2 stars for the service, additional star because the sauce is worth coming back for."}
{"text":"Went here tonight (Easter 2106) for a birthday dinner. There was about 15 of us. We were seated right away. The service was excellent. Martin and Dustin were on top of their game. We never waited for refills, they explained to us first timers how to eat crawfish. Our good came out pretty quickly, and they got our order right. 100% percent satisfied and definitely worth every penny. Thank you guys for a great experience.  Highly recommend this place. Can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"This is my go to place right here!   I absolutely love Hot N Juicy!  To me this is a great place to come have dinner with your family or take a date.   And it's in the heart of Mill Ave in college town so it's plenty excitement in the area.   I always get the king,  or snow crab in the garlic sauce with potatoes and sausage in the bag.   The fries are good also.   Make sure you wear your bib,  it will get messy."}
{"text":"We have eaten dinner here twice.  The first time in August of 2014 and the second time in February of 2015.  It is a little hard to find and the parking requires a little walking, a few hundred feet.  Both times we visited were Friday evenings, little early before the dinner rush.  The resturant and area have great young college town vibe.  Music is fun and the hostis are friendly.    The food:  Yes, some seafood is seasonal so there will be quality variation.  Overall the crawfish have been good out of season.  The shrimp were excellent.  The oysters were in season and excellent.  The beer is cold and the view is good.    During the last visit it appeared they were having some staffing issues.  We arrived around 5:15 and started with one server who was very friendly and professional for a college town.  Our dozen oysters came out and while the plate was organized, one oyster was not opened.  We sent the one oyster back to be opened.  It did not return.  While dining we saw staff rushing in, either late or had been called in.  Our waitress changed with a hand off.  The replacement waitress was also good.  We asked about our lost oyster and they came out with it within moments.  While it was not \"flawless\" the flaws were inconsequential.    What we saw at the table next to us during our meal nearly made us cry!  There was an elderly mixed race couple, appeared to be in their 80's wintering here from NY.  They ordered crab.  The waitress listened and conversed with them graciously as they told her they have wintered in AZ for the last 32 years.  She shared that she was a student and studying accounting (I think).  When their food came, the gentleman did not have the hand strength to tear apart his crab.  He was embarrassed.......  The waitress was so kind and with great care and tenderness tore apart the crab and made up his plate.  While doing this she conversed and her body language was so tender she could have been their great granddaughter.  The couple enjoyed their special meal and my wife and I promised to still live life when we grew old together.    In essence:  Good food, great location, and a work culture which is friendly to the local students and the snowbirds."}
{"text":"I didn't know that there were so many Hot N Juicy Crawfish's in Las Vegas.  My daughter and I came to this location and we got seated right away.  We sat near the entrance so the service wasn't that great since the wait staff was mainly focusing on the big room in the back.  It took forever to get my iced tea refilled so I ended up going up to the waitress in the back room asking for a refill.    Otherwise food was good, we ordered the following:  1 lb of shrimp - Shrimp was a good size, they \"snapped\" when I bite into them so they were fresh.    1 lb of crawfish - Smallest crawfish I've ever had but they still had good flavor.  2 corns - frozen corn because it was soggy to the bite.  Fried catfish with seasoned fries - regret getting this, the meat on the catfish was very soft so maybe that is the texture of catfish.  Definitely not my favorite.   I will definitely go back and just order the shrimp and crawfish."}
{"text":"First time to hot n juicy from 3 years living here and don't know why we waited so long!! Compared to the other crawfish restaurants..this place is my favorite!! Got medium lemon pepper shrimp, corn, potato & sausage and was totally an amazing choice!! It was soooo good!! Had jessica & Rick as servers and they made the experience fun, energetic & making us wanna come back tomorrow!! What topped it off compared to the other places was that they give you gloves to use (I have a cut on my finger so didn't want to get the sauce on it) and they have sinks outside the bathroom to wash your hands! Oh AND the whole ambiance and feel of this location I LOVEEE!! It's interior design was so nice and clean and the fact that it wasn't busy made the experience so relaxing while we ate!! Thanks for coming to this side!! See you tomorrow :)"}
{"text":"So for people from the Bay, Hot N Juicy Crawfish is a bit of a fusion of Red Crawfish on Larkin in SF and Boiling Crab in San Jose. Same concepts of your choice of spiced seafoods and appetizers, minus the one hour wait of Boiling Crab (at least the time that I went there). Our party of four was seated with hardly a five minute wait. Spicy. Spicy. Spicy. LOVED it.   The only advice I have for future patrons are: 1) If you go and plan on going out after, PLEASE do yourself a favor and either bring a large bottle of Listerine and cologne/perfume OR 2) Go with enough time to go home/back to your hotel for a nice, LONG shower to cleanse the smelliness from your hair, body and a fresh change of clothes!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I've never been to a Boiling Crab, or any other crawfish/shrimp/whatever establishment.  Considering I don't really have a means of comparison against the competition, I must say, I really enjoyed this meal. Juicy and spicy shrimp and crawfish.. chock full of cholesterol, but hey, who cares? YOLO.    .....Feel free to punch me if I ever say \"YOLO\" again."}
{"text":"This place is a favorite place to eat in Vegas. Be prepared to get your hands dirty, but it well worth it. Great place to have fun with your friends while enjoying a great meal. If you love seafood give this place a try for a taste of New Orleans in Vegas. Parking can be hard and their might be a wait but it is worth the hassle. Take cash to get a percentage off your bill."}
{"text":"The food might not be spectacular, but I was with a large group of friends and I had an awesome dining experience here.   You get a bag of seafood drenched in whatever flavor sauce you want with your level of spicyness. I definitely recommend adding corn to your bag of seafood because it soaks in the flavor and juices and it tastes SO GOOD! Beware that the shrimp comes out with the heads still attached and you have to peel off the shells yourself. My friend wasn't warned and I think she was a little surprised hahah.   So I tried their crawfish and the shrimp in their signature Hot N Juicy sauce (which is a mix of all of the sauces) and it definitely satisfied my seafood cravings. I found it so much fun to eat with your hands like a kid. You get a plastic bid and by the end of the meal, my hands were completely messy hahah so much fun! However, the smell did stick around for awhile but the experience was worth it. Plus, the food came out SO FAST. Our order was ready in less than 10 mins! AWESOME!  We also got some sweet potato fries and cajun fries to share which was a nice side to have. So come prepared to be extremely messy and eat your weight in seafood!  Price wise: you pay by the pound. It ended up being around $10/lb for the shrimp and crawfish."}
{"text":"Love the garlic butter  snow crab. The food quality is excellent. They could work on the service but the food makes up for it. I am updating my review because I lowered their score from 5 stars to 3 stars. I've dined at all three locations. Every time I order rice they neglect to bring it. I have to ask twice for my rice. Everything else is delivered. What is so hard about remembering to give me my rice ???? It's so annoying. If it weren't for the snow crabs I would not return."}
{"text":"yum!!! my friend who is obsessed with crawfish brought me here for a quick snack and it was fantastic! it was so so fun, and very much an experience and a food. we each got a pound of the hot n juicy special and it was garlicky. like super super garlicky. but it was spicy and delicious and came with a corn and a potato that was covered with the saucy and it was just perfect.  the crawfish themselves were really fresh and cooked well. none of the fishy taste and also no rubberiness. it was just so good. we also got the corn fritters. i had never had those before, but they were great. crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, and a little gooey in the very center, with a few corn chunks. they were sweet but not too sweet and came with a creamy dipping sauce.  the staff here are super nice too. the servers are attentive and everyone is really helpful and nice. we only had time for a snack but i wish we could have gotten a few more pounds of crawfish. a reason to come back to vegas, i guess."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. We had a large group and they tailored everyone's bill. They were attentive and fast plus they all had amazing personalities!!! Will come back often."}
{"text":"Four stars because Hot N Juicy Crawfish...ran out of crawfish the day we ate there.  Then again, that just shows how popular this place is.  Instead, I ordered shrimp with the Hot N Juicy special seasoning, as well as calamari.  Not much of a sight, seeing food in a plastic bag, but all the spices mixed together just makes it all tastier.    Friendly staff.  Welcoming atmosphere.  Decently priced.  So wash those hands, put on that bib, and get those hands dirty. :)"}
{"text":"I've only been to one other place like this and it was in Southern California. I don't think I can give this place 5 stars with a clear conscience because it probably isn't one of the best crab boil places out there. I haven't visited enough of them to truly judge.  That said, this place is pretty good. It's really nice if you want to catch a game or something because they have multiple tv screens set up in the restaurant.  You'll be eating with your hands so you don't have to focus any of your attention towards coordinating utensils with your food. Just peel and eat. I favor the shrimp, snow crab, and sausage. They also make pretty good cajun fires, made better when you dip them in the 'Hot N Juicy' sauce.  It's a fun, extremely casual, place to eat. It's impossible not to get messy, but the bib helps. Worth a visit."}
{"text":"Good place for fun. We got the first option which is pretty good to feed 3 people. It had shrimp and crawfish with a lot of sausage, 2 potato and 2 corn. We also got the king crab legs which were a disappointment because it was all shell and no meat for $30. The waitress came once and was never seen again. Our drinks were never refilled and the waitress had to clock out so we got someone new. Which wasn't bad because he actually refilled our drinks and check up on us."}
{"text":"First time eating at this restaurant. Totally lost when it came to eating Crawfish. Unique place.  The food is served in a bag, Get Your Feet Wet was what we ordered included 1 lb Crawfish,  1 lb shrimp, sausage, 2 corn and 2 potatoes.  Had we not had our awesome server Lemonade, we would have starved. She taught us how to get onto the Crawfish and Shrimp. So patient and attentive. We also ordered the King Crab, sold by the pound. Hot, spicy, flavorful and a fun dinning adventure. Thank you Lemonade, we will be back."}
{"text":"Got paid and wanted to try something new and seafood. Heard Hot N Juicy was bomb place so I had to check it out and it was so worth.    My cousins and I came here to try it. It did look intimidating not knowing what to do and order but the waitress was amazingly helpful, even gave us recommendations and caution us about the spicy levels(Huge help!). They sell by the pound and by market price. We ended up getting Three lb of craw fish, two fries, Two lb of Shrimp, dozen of sausages, half a dozen oysters, and rice. Came out to $95 for four people and to us it wasn't a bad deal for first time experience.  if you are willing to pay around $20-30 for seafood and fun way of eating then this is an amazing spot!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this and it did not disappoint! We tried the hot and juicy crawfish as well as a half pound of butter shrimp for my little one. We also got a basket of chicken nuggets with sweet potato fries for the kids. Although it took me a while to get used to peeling crawfish, Everything was delicious! We arrived at 4:30pm and got the last booth before the crowds began. Also, I accidentally left my credit card and when I discovered it was gone I called them and thy held it for me safely and returned it to me after I showed them my ID."}
{"text":"When you pass by a restaurant on a Sunday night and find it full, this must say something good about the place right? Right!   I have never been to Hot & Juicy Crawfish before nor has it been recommended to us but since it was packed and my husband and I were hungry, trying to pick an alternative place to eat at in Mill Ave after our shawerma plans failed, we thought, seafood for the evening? Why not!  We walked in, were seated immediately & given the menus. Our server came to our table a few min after that and asked us if it was our first time and since we were first timers, she offered to explain the menu. Everything sounded really good. My small disappointment was that they were out of Lobsters. After our server explained the menu, she gave us a few min to decide on what to order. We ordered (at first) a pound of shrimp with the hot and juicy sauce and baby spice level (didn't wanna burn our stomachs so late in the evening!). We also ordered a potato, 1 corn, 1 order of fried fish basket and 1 sweet tea & 1 water. Before the server left, she asked us if we needed gloves and everything and we said yes. Basically here, you wear a bib, u put on ur gloves and u peal ur shrimps or crack ur crabs, or whatever you have ordered and throw the shells on the nylon covered table. Messy but Interesting!   The order didn't take too long to come out. The shrimps come out in a bag (with the corn inside, yum). Everything was hot and fresh to the point where I was almost burning my fingers pealing those shells off the shrimps! The shrimps were delicious, the sauce was superb, we loved it! The corn, having soaked all the juices in the bag tasted out of this world. This was great, too great, we had to order more! So we ordered another pound of shrimp and this time, 2 corns! My husband just had to try the corn, I wouldn't let him leave before he did!   Overall, very interesting experience & food was delicious. 4 stars because they were out of a couple of options and because of the potato! $2 for one small red potato is a little too much. When I ordered an order of potato I thought I'll have a few! One is not enough and not for $2. Other than that, the service was great and the food was excellent. $47 for all this was a very good deal at the end. Definitely coming back, definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"We usually get a lb of shrimp and green mussels, hot n juicy style. Customer service is good but can improve better on the team work side. Id say some of the workers must just be busy or they might just have poor customer service. But our server was great. Im guessing if your not one of the other servers tables, they dont have the desire to help you or delegate the task to your actual server."}
{"text":"Messy, spicy, juicy, no plates, bibs, gloves...Awesome Taste! Second time we've visited and the food is great! Everything comes in a bag and you do have to order the sides a la carte. The lobster, shrimp and clams are great. Have to return to try the other menu items. One thing though, after two visits now, we were handed the bill without being asked if we needed anything else. Not cool but not a deal breaker. I'm sure it varies from server to server. Yes, we're going back!"}
{"text":"The food here was SOOO good. Omg my husband and I loved it!  We were greeted and seated the moment we walked in. Our waitress was great! Super friendly and super helpful. She was constantly coming back to check on us and make sure everything was great.   We orders clams, shrimp, lobster, and King crab legs. Everything was absolutely delicious! We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Yummy..yummy...YUMMY!  Found out about this place from Man Vs. Food and Adam did not disappoint!  Parking kinda sucks though... Not a big fan of the crawfish but ordered some anyway, and yep..still don't like them, the shrimp is great though. I guess we got lucky with time since there was no wait for tables. We got served promptly but got slow later on. Overall experience is good. Most likely visit again when I'm in town :)"}
{"text":"We made a stop here for a quick lunch before heading back to the airport. The hot and juicy flavor was delish, I got mine with medium heat. I ordered a pound of clams, 1/2 a pound of shrimp and a few pounds of crawfish. Everything was cooked perfectly, I hate when you order seafood and they tend to overcook. The flavors were so good, it can get a little salty but I ordered a side of rice to help balance it out. Waitress was excellent, very attentive, especially for how busy they were, overall great service. I wish we had this chain in Houston. We have similar types of crawfish joints like Hot N Juicy but I haven't found any place I really love yet. Oh and watch out, you will have major garlic breath after leaving here. Def. recommend checking this place out if you haven't."}
{"text":"Best Cajun crawfish...waaaay better than Boiling Crab. Their sauce is so so so so good...really nice kick to it compared to Boiling Crab. Guess what they have here that's amazing??? Etouffee! Yes...it's a bowl of deliciousness...and no, it's not like Gumbo or whatever BC serves.  Etouffee...lots of seafood...and exploding in flavor.. I get this without the rice...  BTW they serve Jasmine Rice here!!!  Sounds kinda weird...but doesn't matter. I love it. Rice at BC always sucks.  They give you gloves here...which is a plus!  Last time I went they didn't have Etouffee..... They better have it next time...BETTER!"}
{"text":"Had an absolutely amazing experience at this restaurant. The food was phenomenal and the staff was a delight. My server Hannah was patient with us and was always around when we needed anything. Another employee Bri was especially inviting and made the entire experience feel like home. Definitely gonna come back, if not for the food, for the staff. Amazing restaurant."}
{"text":"The food here is good, I enjoyed it! If you're craving \"Cajun\" style seafood this is your place to go.   What I liked:   - Hot N Juicy special seasoning .... this seasoning is really good! MUCH better than The Boiling Crab  - Crawfish and Shrimp - Oysters were pretty good, although I got a stomach ache about 10 minutes later (could have been from something else for all we know, or just how my body reacts to oysters)  What I didn't like:   - Service: I guess they need more waiters during the daytime or early evenings? It just wasn' that \"great\".     I would definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"This location is amazing, my boyfriend and I live across town, but we always come here because of the amazing service, Max always does a great job making sure we always get everything as soon as possible, and making sure we get the best experience every time!!"}
{"text":"sooooooooooo effin good! enough said"}
{"text":"Shrimp-licious - Big, Plump & Juicy! Be prepared to get down and dirty as you feast on bags of hot & juicy seafood. You're in finger lickin' territory! Oh and the sweet potato fries are fried to perfection! Be sure to order them. Nothing you order will go untouched.  Onto the service... They were busy & our service was poor. They messed up the order once and didn't come out with our fries until we were about done with the shrimp. Bathrooms needed attending to as well.  If service was on point, this would def be a 5 star."}
{"text":"After man vs. food was there. of course this place becomes a 24/7 busy restaurant. I also become their Miami fans :p Their parking lot is very small and most people have to park on the street.  Love their house special sauce that  included every sauces together. Be careful the middle sauce is super hot after a while..."}
{"text":"This is one of the best crawfish joints in the area. It is a bit expensive but the price is worth it. Give there po boys a try. You won't be disappointed unless you have a huge appetite then you might be still hungry like me. Sweet potato we're on fleek."}
{"text":"Update from my previous review: Food was always great as always! Staff were awesome today! Very attentive, makes table touches making sure drinks are topped. Busier today compared to my last review but staff team today was superb than before. Lemon (server) was great! The staff  has smiles on their faces.  The guy who relieved lemon was awesome too (Sorry i can't remember his name). Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Not bad- but you'll stink like crazy! The food's good, but not the best of it's kind. Still, prices are very reasonable, and the server ladies are super friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"My first time ordering from Hot N Juicy and the lady over the phone taking my take out order was really nice and so helpful!! I would have to give this place 5 stars because of the wonderful customer service I received ordering my food over the phone (also my parents come to this location all the time and the food is always delicious) wish I had her name but definitely 5 starts.  She recommended if the medium flavor since the spicy is extra hot today"}
{"text":"This place is like Boiling Crab but not as good. The service is super good. I really enjoyed the oysters and soft shell crab. One thing I missed was the lime dip that you get at Boiling Crab. I was disappointed that the craw fish was so tiny because I read on yelp that they are bigger than Boiling Crab. Overall it was a nice dining experience and the prices are almost the same as Boiling Crab."}
{"text":"This was some of the best seafood in a bag ! The corn and boiled potato is so good. Friend shrimp and catfish was very delicious."}
{"text":"Small portion for the amount I paid. Craw fish is not as tasty as I hope it would be. it's my first time to order here. I'll opt to order elsewhere next time.   3-star, because the dishes are still pretty decent cajun meals compared to most I've tried in Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is super good I would highly recommend to try this place. But we had a waiter named Freddy and he sucked. He spilt food a lot over the seat never came to check on us. We had to ask for everything. He forgot our order. Honestly just a horrible waiter. He really did kill the mood."}
{"text":"Always a great experience here! There's two locations on spring mtn, this is the smaller of the two. We came right in and say down.  They where running a special bogo for po' boys.  If you check-in.  Well if course I did! I ordered the shrimp po' boy with the Cajun seasoning fries. The fries were spicy!!! The sandwich was good! I ordered the second one to go.  The vibe is always great here along with the service. I like that they serve weddings and beer. Three best part is wearing the bibs!"}
{"text":"Good eating. 4lbs crawfish in the hot and juicy sauce. Mild spice. Wish i had ordered a notch up. Came with corn and potato. Also ordered 2lb shrimps. Delicious all around. Extremely messy. It was nice to try something different then all the buffets i ate the previous few days. Price was came out to about $60 or so. Will be back when i visit once again."}
{"text":"Ate here for a friend's birthday and had a pleasant experience for the most part.  Crawfish here are awesome but they only had frozen and ran out of fresh when we were here.  They were still super good but couldn't try fresh.  You eat at a large table that you make a mess at because you will be eating lots of seafood at a family style setting.  Beer was good but service was not so good.  Our waiter was nowhere to be found at times which was anything.  Overall a great place for crawfish and a group of people to eat at."}
{"text":"Absolutely flavorful!! My favorite is the snow crabs extra spicy. Makes my mouth water just thinking about it. Lol. And you must order corn. It so sweet and melts in your mouth. And if you like sweet potatos order sweet potato fries. Crispy and sweet."}
{"text":"I'm just a southern girl in Arizona looking for a good crawfish boil. And I was very disappointed with my experience here. Not only was my waiter unattentive and rude. But the execution of my meal in all aspects was mediocre. From the cooking to the presentation I was sorely left unfulfilled. 2 stars for the effort out west though"}
{"text":"This place is comparable to boiling crab. I prefer BC's sauces, but if there isn't a BC around, this place still satisfies your craving. Prices are ok, service is very friendly and fast. I got the shrimp in hot and juicy medium with corn...pretty great, crawfish in garlic butter mild with corn...pretty good, catfish basket-  don't get the fish basket, didn't taste right."}
{"text":"Having seen HNJC on \"Man vs Food\" some time ago, I couldn't resist the opportunity to chow down there during a brief bidness trip through Las Vegas...solo action.  Not wanting to look like a complete creep and glutton peeling and mashing crawfish after crawfish into my mouth alone at a table for two; I took my order of Hot N Juicy Special Green Mussels (1lb) and Crawfish (1lb) to go.    Back at my lair, The Palms, I dutifully laid out my feast on plastic bibs as not to completely destroy the entire room.  After doing so I realized I was one bib short for mine own self!  Alas, this is where we turn down Creepy Drive.  After locking the door, hanging the \"Do Not Disturb\" sign and drawing the blinds, I stripped down to my skivvies and feasted.    There is something quite liberating and simultaneously shaming about eating dinner in your underwear.  However, the satisfaction I received from gorging on the delicious shellfish washed away any lingering feelings of penitence.  Will be back, hopefully with friends, if not take out it is!"}
{"text":"Eat at your own risk!!!! I recently ate here with my brother for lunch and we both experienced food poison from the seafood. I called to report it, but as you may already know, there phone just rings and rings and no one ever answers so I took a chance to email the manager and I actually did get a response back within about 1-3 days asking for more information and a copy of my receipt, which I sent, and I never heard back. As if they don't care that they are serving food that cause people to get sick. I've eaten here multiple times and this time it caused me to feel terrible. The fact that they don't care says a lot about the managing team. They still charge the same, but cut down on the portions, the sauce is not as thick as it used to be, it seems watered down and very thin. Bye, bye Hot & Juicy!!!! Hello Angry Crab.  Update: After posting this review I did hear back from the manager, who apologized for my bad experience and reimbursed my brother and I."}
{"text":"OMG!!! This was the best place of this kind that I have been to. I give it a total ten. Service, atmosphere, wait time and most of all the food was FANTABULOUS!! So looking forward to coming back to this establishment. I hope all the HNJs are the same as far as service and food or else that would be a great disappointment."}
{"text":"Well one of my friends insisted on coming here. So this place isn't flashy or apart of the strip, it's in I guess the Chinatown section of Vegas.  It was pretty busy for a Friday at 3pm. There was a 30 minute wait so we went next door and all got 30 minute massages lol(awesome). So we come back and get seated at our table.  Waitress was super sweet and attentive  Took our order,  put on those garbage bag bibs lol, and gloves.  Food came out and man it was hott, like spicy hot.  Which is great but i had a runny nose after the first 2 bites but I didn't mind lol just caught me off guard.  All the food was just below great. The cajun fries were way to oily for my liking. The cajun calamari was good, but portion was small, the softshell crab was surprisingly good even thou I am not a fan of crab.  Overall I'd enjoyed the experience with cause of my great friends, great service,  good food, and a break from the strip.  I think the most fascinating part of this experience was looking around at how everyone sat there with tables packed with food and then nothing was left. So it's definitely an experience I'd recommed"}
{"text":"I highly recommend this location, room is nice and spacious. Since 4 years I am taking my team to enjoy sucking crawfish LOL, its our little tradition! Like almost every year we were assisted by Polina! She was funny, had new people in my team who never been to Hot N Juicy, she knew the menu by heart and suggested them some items she believed they might like and THEY DID! I knew we would have a great time, Polina's service was excellent like usual (didn't have to place my order she remembered what I liked :-)) Even expecting a baby she was running like a chicken to pleased all the clients she had in charge!! Nice place, good food, if you have a group be patient Thank you again Polina for making our Christmas tradition a happy one Chann"}
{"text":"Outstanding food and great service.  We keep coming back when ever we are in town.  If you like peel and eat shrimp you can get them with a variety of seasoning and different levels of spice/heat."}
{"text":"Heard this is the best crawfish joint in chinatown so, naturally we had to come here to give it a try and what's weird is that they have two locations really close by each other and we just didn't know which one would taste better so we decided to go to this location. Be prepared to come out smelling like what you just ate as our uber driver noticed it but he said he loved the smell lol wonder what everyone else though as we walked the stripped after our meal.  I ordered the 1lb blue crab, 1 lb crawfish and dozen oyster shooters hot n juicy style in mild. The prices here are crazy cheaper than places like rockin' crawfish and hang ten boiler here in the bay area and surprisingly tasted way better (funny how we got better crawfish in the dessert than back at home). The flavor of the sauce was amazing with chunks of minced garlic and the amazing flavor of cajun spices with a hint of sweetness and i just wish they gave you more sauce to go with your food.  The Blue crab was crazy cheap and we lucked out with 3 female crabs with eggs (YUM!) a little under cooked but cooked enough as the meat was a little mushy. If you order the blue crab be prepared to really get your hands dirty as they give you the whole crab and you have to pry the head off (which i don't mind and every time i eat at crawfish spots i don't use gloves so my fingers end up smelling for a week or so haha). The crawfish was perfectly boiled and the tail came out perfectly and was the highlight of my meal. The Oyster was a bit disappointing as they were really large in size and it had no flavor on the oyster or the juices. It tasted like they pried the oysters open then rinsed it in water.  The staff was just amazing and really efficient in their roles. Our server was attentive and checked on us regularly. She made sure to keep us in the know about our meal (she said our order will come as they cook and that the crab will come last as it take a while to cook), when our drinks were running low she would swoop in to refill our beverage.   Highly recommended spot if you're in Vegas"}
{"text":"I'm so glad they opened up this location on the strip (located around the corner of Planet Hollywood, next to Buffalo Wild Wings, and past the walkway bridge) so we don't have to uber, lyft or drive to Spring Mountain Blvd for their other two locations over there.   This is our must go to everytime we visit Las Vegas and we come here atleast 2 times on our trip (1 when we arrive and 1 before we leave). This trip was no exception and since it was so close to our hotel (Planet Hollywood) too bad we didn't stay longer since the only place we ate in our two nights here were 2 other places and Hot N Juicy twice!  Food:  I've been to 3 of their Las Vegas locations now and they all have been consistently the same. The Hot n Juicy sauce is the best i've had out of all the crawdad places like this i've been. The sauce is garlicky, thick enough to stick to the meat and shell but not too thick that it has a goopey texture. The spice levels are on point along with the flavors without it being too oily from the butter.   The Lousiana style was on point as well. No, it's not as thick as the Hot n Juicy but, it still doesn't skip out on the flavor of Lousiana. It's watery but, the juices gets all up inside of the meat and just bathes it in incredible authentic tasting Cajun juice that brings me back to my grandparents days when they made their seafood boil (they're from Lousiana and Georgia).   This time around I got 1lb of crawfish and 1lb of blue crab. This time around the blue crab was really meaty and larger than last time i came at their other 2 location and they still came in a pair only instead of a male and female like my previous experience, this time it came in with 2 males (on both visits this trip). But, we ended up getting a pleasant surprise. Since they were celebrating their anniversary, if you order a lb of blue crab you get a extra blue crab for free.   When we first came here we didn't know that and told the server that we didn't order those crabs and our waitress went back to talk to the person who took our order and came back explaining their deal. Guess what too.. both times the extra crab were female with eggs (YES!).  End food review  The staff are consistently friendly and attentive. The food is quality and the price is perfect. You just can't go wrong with any of the Hot n Juicy locations.   Please open one up in the Bay Area. Thank you :D"}
{"text":"My faves here were the clams, king crab legs, and soft shell crab. It was all so good! I'm not even a big fan of clams usually, but the sauce made it so delicious. We had crawfish, too, even though the fresh ones weren't available.. But I didn't really enjoy that as much. But even for frozen crawfish, they were really big but I just didn't think the flavor stuck to them as good as the other seafood."}
{"text":"we walways go here everytime we crave for spicy. this is my all time fave resto. price is okay. servers are okay. waiting time  is not that long.      this is the place we always go whenever theres visitor in our house."}
{"text":"Really good stuff, everything tasted fresh, spicy as their name and menu suggests and you get reasonable portions for the amount you pay. I had 1lb of crawfish, 1lb of shrimp, and 1lb of clams, and in retrospect I would say 2.5 lbs instead of the 3lbs I had would have been a better choice as I was extremely full after this. If you like crawfish then go ahead and order it here, if you never had it or are on the fence I would refrain because a) its much harder to eat than the other items b) they can be somewhat small so you spend a lot of time for little meat.  I am docking a star because of the garlic overpower at times, and surprisingly it lasts for about 10 hours after you eat and you will have it in your breath and constantly taste it even after brushing your teeth. Wake up in the morning and you might be burping garlic flavors. They have a few different flavors so not everything has to be spicy and hot but it all mixes so it tastes pretty much the same."}
{"text":"Are you a Hot & Juicy person or a Boiling Crab person? That is the question!   I am currently Team Hot & Juicy.   Making sure that I don't come here as often as I use to, allows me to look forward to coming back. The garlic smell that lingers for about 24 hours on your mouth and nails tend to steer me away from coming. But other than that, this place is amazing.   The flavors just pop in my mouth, I love it. I usually get shrimp hot & juicy medium. With a side of rice, Cajun fries, and extra butter. I usually get the sauce from the shrimp and put it in the butter and use that as an extra dipping sauce. bomb! I can drink that spicy butter all day! It is very UNHEALTHY but hey, YOLO right?   The staff is pretty Attentive and with another location opening up its not as busy as it used to be before. This location does have limited parking space though which can cause some trouble for me.   And for some reason their raspberry ice tea is amazing. It's probably just regular ol' raspberry ice tea you usually get everywhere but I think with all the spices, the raspberry ice tea just compliments everything lol!"}
{"text":"Service was not good. Ordered calamari and came out cold, then brought back the regular and then, the basket kept getting smaller and smaller. Then, food never came. Asked and said he thought we only ordered one. We each took turns ordering. How the heck you get one order?"}
{"text":"Fun place to try out. I found the shrimp was a lot better than the crawfish. You just don't get enough meat from the crawfish. Overall the food wasn't really my cup of tea."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Lemon pepper is delicious. The only bad is that we came on a night where the crawfish wasn't fresh. They only had frozen ones. The staff is super friendly and actually looks like they enjoy what they do. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Okay, this review may be a little biased because I'm comparing my Hot and Juicy experience with Boiling Crab out in California, but really... Hot and Juicy?  NOT SO HOT AND JUICY!  My friend recommended this place because her cousin saw it on the Food Network.  I want to go to Food Network, tell them that they SUCK, that they should retract the special on Hot and Juicy, and that they should do a special on Boiling Crab instead.  Okay, maybe not as harsh.  - We all ordered the shrimp with the Medium Hot and Juicy Special sauce.  At BC, you can see the garlic, pepper, and the deep red sauce in the bag.  Also,  the Medium Whole Shabang has a spicy taste that lingers.   This is what I was expecting.  Instead, the shrimp at H&J came out super bland, not spicy, and not juicy at all.  I had to squish my shrimp around the barely-there sauce to get it to have any flavor at all.  - We had to ask for limes, salt, and pepper.  They took forever to get the limes out to us.  It was as if they went to go buy limes and cut them up just for us.  - You can't draw on the walls.  How wack is that? Haha.    The staff was friendly and the venue was clean, but it just didn't live up to my expectations.  I'm sorry H&J...  2 stars for you cuz: \"Meh.  I've definitely experienced better.\""}
{"text":"My BFF and I come to Vegas about once a year. Purpose? HOT N JUICY! Yes, in Canada we have copycats but it doesn't make the cut. We love this place so much that one time, we came here 6x over a 3 day trip. In fact, our first visit included us polishing off 10lbs of seafood. Some may call that disgusting. We viewed that as an accomplishment.  What to order: Shrimp is always (as the name suggests) hot n juicy. You must order this! Crawfish is a novelty which you'll definitely order the first time, but likely eventually realize that it's a lot of work for a wee bit of meat. Lobster is excellent but the sauce doesn't penetrate. Mussels are good if you like mussels. Green are juicier and plumper than black. Snow crab is good but my recommendation would be to order it on its own so it doesn't get cold. King crab is amazing and you'll need at least 1 lb between 2 people. 3 people? Get 2 lbs.  Btw: Eric, who was our server the last time we were there is AMAZING. He deserves a promotion. We wish our entire (generous ) tip could have gone to him!!!"}
{"text":"What a fun and unique place to eat!  I had a great time here and definitely want to return the next time I travel to Vegas.  I got here at about 8pm on a Friday night and didn't have to wait for a table.  Our waitress was very attentive and helpful.  She recommended her favs and gave great suggestions. The four of us ordered 3 lbs. shrimp, 1 lb. king crab legs, a lobster which was about 1.5 lbs. , and 4 corns.  We all liked the shrimp the best and found it very fun to peel the shells off.  We also all liked the hot n juicy sauce the best, which was a mixture of  all their sauces.  The medium spicy level was more than enough!  I recommend dipping your seafood into the sauce after you peel it out of its shell!  YUM! I minused one star because they were out of the dungeness crab, they also shorted us 1 corn, and the lobster took very very long to come out (I think they accidentally forgot about it until we reminded them). But this was a great dinner and a great experience and also very affordable!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious and unlike the other locations, when I've gone,  there was no wait at all. I got the medium hot n juicy on my snow crab and crawfish. It still had a lot of heat to it but the flavor was delicious! Service was prompt and friendly....I will definitely return to this location next time we're in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Omg this place is awsome much better than boiling crab  and the waitresses are smoking hot good god almighty."}
{"text":"I haven't been to hot and juicy for awhile and have had no issues with them in the past so when a my brother came to visit I figured I would order some crawfish since he was craving it. Much to my surprise I was very disappointed. In total I ordered about 6 lbs of crawfish and they were not good quality at all. Much of the crawfish seemed like they had been dead for awhile as the shell and texture was very mushy. I'm talking like they had been dead for a few of days. In addition, the shells of the crawfish were very discolored. Crawfish are suppose to have red shells and sometimes they get dark when you boil them but these shells were so dark they were almost black. Additionally, I feel like I was getting a little cheated. When i looked at the menu there's a distinction in pricing with regular crawfish and frozen crawfish. I believe regular crawfish is about $11.99 per lb. and frozen is about $9.99 per lb. I definitely got frozen crawfish and was still charged $11.99 per lb. The only reason why I gave this place two stars is because of its sauce. It's good and I give credit when it's due. If you really want crawfish I highly recommend the buffet at the orleans hotel and casino. They have some really big crawfish and it's about $20 for dinner but it's all you can eat and there's other food at the buffet like prime rib as well! I eat there from now on."}
{"text":"Although our first visit didn't go as great as we planned, we have been there about 3 times ever since then and we are so pleased! Love everything about this place! After our first review, the manager \"Naomi\" was so awesome! She apologized and gave us a free meal to make up for everything. We really love going here.. They're usually very busy but the wait is always worth it! Love the fries. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I finally got to try the original Hot N Juicy Crawfish during my recent trip to Vegas last week!  After getting dropped off in a cab at Boiling Crab and finding out that they were out of crawfish, (!!!) a group of 9 of us literally walked a mile to Hot N Juicy.  We split our orders into 2, and my group ordered:   - 10 pounds of crawfish, hot, Hot N Juicy special - 2 pounds of shrimp, hot, garlic butter - 1 pound of snow crab legs, hot, Hot N Juicy special  EVERYTHING was flavorful, tender, and juicy.  It was definitely more \"hot\" than I had expected, (I'm used to the \"hot\" here in DC) which wasn't a bad thing at all.  Although they messed up our order of shrimp (they gave us Hot N Juicy special instead of garlic butter) and the server was very unaccomodating towards the mistake, (She asked us: \"Are you sure that's the wrong one?\") repeatedly having to ask for things, (salt and pepper and limes, gloves, cleaning out our buckets, etc.) and spilling juices on my back while cleaning up -- everything else was smooth.  I could understand that it was really busy and serving a group of 9 might have been challenging, especially because we all had different drink orders and requests.  This is definitely a \"must-try\" if you're in Vegas and love seafood!"}
{"text":"No Plates no silverware. I love Crawfish one way hot and spicy. I have been to Hot N Juicy Twice enjoyed the meal both times. It is a dinner that goes great with a beer.   Always get corn and a potato that makes it a meal.   Greg"}
{"text":"tldr  Wait times could get long, but food is always on point. Can watch the game and peel shrimp.  Get: -hot n juicy pound of shrimp mild (add corn and potatoes) -white rice ($2)  Protip: use the sauce from the shrimp bag and mix it into the rice."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed with this place,definitely over hyped. I got the catfish and fries, the cat fish was cooked in cornmeal (not good), and the fries were way too spicy. I had to send my meal back. I would suggest sticking with crawfish or shrimp. The good thing is they have $2.50 adult beverages. Other than that it's just mediocre."}
{"text":"I've been to Hot N Juicy many times, and each time I've left satisfied for the most part, at this location and the newer one east on the road.   The shrimp and crawfish are fairly priced and delicious with the hot n juicy sauce. BUT Be advised that if you are comparing the spiciness to that of boiling crab...this place is SPICIER.  (Example: the medium signature hot n juicy sauce is on a spicier scale than the medium house sauce at boiling crab and has been for a couple of years consistently :) )  The service is okay. I've had good service here and not so great service here in the past. This time around was a bit confusing. (MLK Monday afternoon around 3-4pm). We were greeted at the front and told to wait after giving my name and Party, then greeted again where the host asked for my name and party size again. After she walked away, another person asked if we were being helped. -_-  [STORY: During dinner, the main hostess who seated us also took our drink orders...then a man who's name tag said \"lead waiter\" asked for the same thing. Ended up ordering food with him, and getting food by her. He checked up on us regularly, and refilled our waters a couple times. Ordered salt and pepper with her, and she forgot twice...and brought it after asking the man.   The table next to us complained about not having bibs, not being offered gloves, not having utensils with their rice, and needing things quicker]  I think this place is definitely good... The restrooms have become cleaner, but should be checked more routinely for soap. Service is up and down, but either we came on a training day or a little communication between waiters/waitresses would be helpful...and annoy less customers :)"}
{"text":"This place is legit. Awesome crab legs shrimp crawfish. Everything was spicy and delicious. Yum. Great service. Another hidden gem in Vegas. You will get dirty but it's so worth it"}
{"text":"I came back the 2nd time craving for some shrimps and I didn't get any!!! Horrible horrible service. I ordered one pound shrimp along with crawfishes. The crawfishes came out but not the shrimps. Our server seem to be avoiding eye contacts. I told her the shrimp never came, she said they back up in the kitchen, alright then. Then I notice they bring out shrimps for this couple that show up after us. I asked three servers and they all said they'll check on it, yet avoiding my eyes when am waiting for them to come back. We done with our crawfishes and still no shrimps!! The check came out and I told the girl I still have not get my shrimp, she can cancel it, her response was \"ill see what I can do\". Came back and says that she was able to remove it from the check, well shit! Of course  am not paying for something I didn't get! As if it was trouble to ask her to not charge me. One more things, they decide to pull out a bin of trashes and instead of going thru the front door, they made my friend get off from her seat so they can pull the bin across, how rude!!!"}
{"text":"Costumer service has to be the worst!! Bunch of \"instagram makeup artist\" serving food because they're not good enough for Mac is not a way to have a great business! Food was good though, service horrible!"}
{"text":"Had to eat here before leaving Tempe. So good we didn't want to leave. Our servers were Hayden and Alexis who were very, very attentive to our party and appreciated their sense of humor to mirror our party's silliness.   The hot n juicy seasoning is a must try!"}
{"text":"Just realized that I just became the Duke of Check-Ins at Hot N' Juicy. I'm pretty ashamed that I haven't written them a review. My family and I get together at the original location about once or twice a month. Found that the food is pretty consistent and is a great place for a large family. We often get shrimp and snow crab with either lemon pepper or hot n' juicy sauces. It's so much fun just getting down and dirty while eating seafood laden with garlicky goodness. You leave with a pretty raunchy smell but this food is worth the extra shower."}
{"text":"Quick and attentive service. The menu gets to the point ! The ladies are super sweet and helpful , especially for me since I was unsure what to get!"}
{"text":"I usually order Hot n Juicy mild shrimp for takeout. I also get mild Cajun fries. The only disadvantage to ordering takeout is that the fries get a little soggy.  I've eaten here a couple of times, and they have good service and usually the food comes out fast. There are TVs on every wall and normally they play sports."}
{"text":"Fun place! Great food! Priced well! Can't wait to go again! Long waits on weekends, inexperienced wait staff, 2 different servers couldn't figure out how to use the wine opener to open our wine. We went as a party group, but as our party grew they refused to let us add the empty table next  to us. Mix comments huh! But I'm ready to try again."}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW. This is friggin good!  Pros:   Great Food Great Service Moderate Prices  Cons:  Long wait time...  Not sure that can be considered a con since long lines mean that alot of people like this place.... I am no exception to the rule, I actually ate here twice within 4 days.  Some tips:  You have to try the Crawfish in the Hot And Juicy sauce, Medium!  It has just the right amount of spice.  This is a really a one of a kind experience.  Word to the wise, DO NOT WEAR WHITE!!  Definitely worth the trip if you're out in Vegas."}
{"text":"Some friends found this place on Yelp so we decided to give it a try!  55 reviewers can't be wrong!  4.5 stars?  I'm there!  Wait, I think these 55 people have never tried crawfish anywhere else =/  I actually can't say too much about the crawfish because I ordered a pound of shrimp.  Based on seasoning (which would have been the same with crawfish anyway), I'd say 3 stars.  My friend's pound of crawfish came with huge crawdaddies and my shrimp were pretty big, too so thumb's up for that!  I ordered the Hot n Juicy Special, which is probably all the others mixed together and was satisfied with my shrimp.  However, I ordered medium and it wasn't spicy at all.  I ordered half a dozen sausages with my shrimp and they were big pieces.  I also ordered a side of corn on the cob but they forgot it so I had to remind them.  When it came out, I took a bite and made the ugliest face ever.  I threw the rest away because it was bitter and drenched in too much seasoning (but I can't really complain about the second part).  I tried my friend's order of Cajun Fries (medium) and THOSE were spicy!  The fries came out crunchy and fat (skinny fat, not fat fat, if you know what I mean lol), which were yummy-o!  I also tried my friend's deep fried soft shell crab and I don't think I'm a big fan of soft shell crab (I don't even love it in sushi rolls).  However, he enjoyed it.  The decor is much like any other crawfish restaurant, it was spacious and the setting was comfortable.  The service is mediocre; no smiling faces but they refilled my drink before I realized I even needed a refill!  Overall, I like you Hot n Juicy.  You didn't disappoint me (but that may have been because I already knew nothing would ever beat Boiling Crab!)  I love that everything was BIG and that the seasoning didn't suck.  I recommend this to anyone who wants to try crawfish in every city you visit, you won't be disappointed but you won't come out thinking it's the best place in the world either."}
{"text":"if you want seafood with lots of spices/flavor then this is your place. my friend and my brother both raved about it but honestly it might have been all the work that sucked all the life out of me. its great if i lived there but i prefer my seafood fried or grilled and not requiring labor. you should go at least once but maybe its the redneck in me that prefers my seafood grilled or fried preferably with a tub of tartar sauce  the sides are nothing to shout home about. great service from our polish waitress though  JEANS: OK by far ORDER: by waitress"}
{"text":"We are from out of town. While we were in Vegas the group wanted to get some sea food. Came here and wow this place is busy. Looks like a popular joint people like to go to to get sea food. The food was good. I enjoyed eating finger food with my friends.  Got the mild sauce with shrimp and the flavor was amazing. Very flavorful and very good indeed."}
{"text":"Really great food!  I'm from Texas and have spent much time in Louisiana...this place is almost as good as any there.  I like the whole experience.  We had great service, and I think the price is very good.  One thing though, I asked the server where they get the crawfish and she said Louisiana.  Find that hard to believe because they aren't in season, unless they freeze them.  The crawfish is small.  But everything else is really good, especially the shrimp.  We had the mild...my friend is a wimp...but it was very tasty.  Next time I go, getting the extra spicy!!!"}
{"text":"This location is usually quicker to get seated compared to their other restaurant on spring mountain so I chose this hot and juicy.  I love the green mussels & shrimp.  My preference is garlic butter with no spice.  Baby spice is still a little too spicy for me.  Have had issues with their servers not relaying no spice to the kitchen properly.  There is specific verbiage to order my preference which is \"butter & minced garlic only.\"  I couldn't remember the exact verbiage but described what I wanted and the server said she knew what i was describing.  My order came out wrong & I asked to get it corrected.  The manager on duty came to my table & proceeded to lecture me about how she told me the verbiage in the past.  First of all, the servers should be trained better so they know how to accurately write an order.  BTW - My server told me she was new and still learning.  Secondly, the manager on duty should politely tell the customer the problem will be fixed and not lecture.  Its not the customers responsibility to write an order so the kitchen knows what to make.  I would give 5 stars because i love the food here but I'm deducting 2 stars since I've had problems here."}
{"text":"During my recent girls trip celebrating one of our girls b-day we decided we were going to eat something messy for Valentines Day... this place definitely won the messy yet tasty award! So we didn't eat in the restaurant, again because we wanted to be messy.  We ordered 1/2 lbs of shrimp, 3 lbs of king crab legs, sausage, corn, and potatoes.  After getting over the fact that the shrimp looks alive, and honestly after my friend cleaned it for me the shrimp was sooo good!   The king crab was the best part. We ordered baby spice and garlic flavors, after a few bites of the shrimp and crab my lips were numb. Delicious! The spices really made the shrimp and crab taste so juicy! The potatoes and everything else was also great! Overall you guys lived up to your name and I'm pretty sure you made Louisiana proud!"}
{"text":"Very interesting and good New Orleans style boil restaurant.  I prefer the shrimp here (heads on) over the crawfish - add some sausage, potatos and corn to the boil and all is good.  1 lb. of shrimp is about $10, add some add-ins and it is around $13, good value, variety of 'boil' sauces are added in - I like the garlic butter mild, which is still pretty hot.  Very casual plastic tablecloth and paper towel joint on the west end of Chinatown on Spring Mountain, reasonable interpretation of a Louisiana crawfish/shrimp boil for Las Vegas - heavily frequented by Louisiana ex-pats and Chinatown regulars.  Very good option if you like this style of cuisine and don't mind making a mess when you eat."}
{"text":"This place is consistently good.  I love it when you open the door and the buttery aroma just hits you.  Ladies, this place will make your purse smell, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Loved the place and customer service. Big ups to Jordan, she did her thang. This place is worth a try if you ever stop by here in Vegas. Liked it better than boiling crab"}
{"text":"This place is fire af. It was my first time here and I went with two friends and oh man this place is amazing. I got a pound of shrimp, a dozen sausages, and Cajun fries. I would come back here because of how amazing the food is. Service is decent."}
{"text":"Compared to the other locations this one is the nicest and biggest.  Although as nice  as the location is the customer service is lacking.  We have never had an issue ordering Garlic & Butter clams (simply garlic & butter) At this location we got it with the Cajun spices . When we asked the server about the order she stated they do not have a Garlic & Butter selection. My boyfriend didn't want to make a fuss so he was just going to eat it. The manager came over to explain the spices and was slightly condescending but she agreed to fix it and give him the the g&b sauce. OK problem solved...when the clams arrived the manager handed them to him and spoke to him like he was a child and again explained if  you don't specify that you only want g&b you will get the Cajun as well.  He bit his tongue because he was about to lose it.  I was kind of taken back by her tone as well.  When he started eating there was so much garlic that it as difficult to eat.  He was so over it and angry he  just did not want to talk to anyone. He felt it was done on purpose because it had to be remade.  I'm still not sure we will visit this location again as the Spring Mountain Locations have never given us any issues.  We hope they get it together and learn how to talk to customers in a respectful manner."}
{"text":"OMG this place is amazing!!!!  We got the lobster with 1lb of shrimp and added corn, sausage, and potatoes with the mild hot n juicy seasoning and it was on point!!! We also got the fried chicken wing basket which came with fries and that was also amazing! The service is always good here  but make sure you go early cause the wait can be a little long but its worth it."}
{"text":"So good!!! I love the lemon pepper sauce. The shrimp and clams were both delicious. What really made our experience the best was our awesome server KB...she was so helpful and has such a positive attitude. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"When my man suggested H&J after a particularly crazy work day, a smile spread across my face.  And, when those delish king crabs came to my table... well, my day got even better.  While the HNJ special blend is fantastic, I found a new favorite in the Lemon Pepper seasoning blend.  I maintain that this place should be Hot & Juicy King Crab.  This time, those suckers came out bigger, badder, and tastier than ever! I mean, these were the biggest Alaskan King Crab legs I have ever seen! Service, was as always, great.  And, $3 for imported beer.... Brilliant.  H&J -- you rock."}
{"text":"How disappointing. Came here with my girlfriend to have a nice dinner and heh were totally off their game tonight.   They gave us a hard time about asking about our food that didn't come out. We ordered some potatoes and they totally forgot about it until the end. Then when I put in an order for clams in garlic butter medium they gave it to me in hot n juicy seasoning medium. I let them know and they told me that they looked very similar. I said I did have it before and the waiter even agreed it did look the same. They gave me a side of garlic butter after the meal was over. They let me know they look very similar and that I was wrong. I told our waiter and the waitress that I have had it before and it did not taste the same. The girl let me know that with different seafoods it tastes different........ I understand different seafood tastes differently that's why I ordered something different in a different sauce!!!! The sauce was definitely hot n juicy and I didn't like how they kept insisting that the sauce wasn't the same.   Anyways. Food was okay. Service was awful. Thanks guys.   *oir waitress name was Polina."}
{"text":"Simple, sloppy and sodium coma inducing.  H&J doesn't mess around, aside from making a devious mess of your shirt and hands.  You get down & dirty here on seafood! It is so f'n good too!  The menu is as complicated as multiplication.  4lbs of shrimp/mussels/crawfish x 6 hungry people = happy full smelly handed people.  Choose butter garlic, spicy Cajun, etc. and how many pounds of it you want.  Add some sides like fries or what-have-you.  The seafood comes in steamy saucy plastic bags that everyone grabs into copiously shoveling into their faces until there's a big pile of shrimp husks and heads, shells laying there.  Barbaric hands-on dining which makes for an interesting first date or family dinner.   As a Pescetarian I don't eat any animals that don't breath underwater.  Aside from the few times documented in my previous reviews, that is.  Hot n' juicy is one of those places that my understanding family agrees to go because of my dietary choice.  No one ever regrets it though."}
{"text":"If you accept this place for what it is, you'll totally enjoy it. It's steamed and spiced seafood. Medium hot n Juicy is the best, not too hot that you can enjoy the seafood. Yes it can be expensive if you want certain seafood such as lobster, but if you go for the experience then it'll be a good time.   I can easily do this myself, but hey- it'll be a mess so why not leave the mess at hot n juicy.  The flavours were bang.   II would go back as I enjoyed my experience and the food. Lobster, snow crab legs and shrimp. Lobster was not much meat since we only enjoy the tail. So, lots of meat wasted and expensive."}
{"text":"I'm visiting Arizona and I'm not from around here. I went online to order food to go. I called the Tempe location but was unaware the numbers listed were for both Tempe and Glendale. I placed an order for 2 pounds of crawfish and the lady advised me that they only had frozen crawfish and it was $7.99. I drove to Tempe and the server at the front named Kristina was not able to find my order.  Come to find out, i placed my order at the Glendale location.  One of the male workers was kind enough to call Glendale location to cancel my order.   I told Kristina that Glendale location advised Me their crawfish was frozen. Kristina and the male employee looked at each other and said,  \"Glendale may have ran out of live crawfish but our crawfish is alive and fresh.\"  LIARS!!!  They charged me $10.99 for a pound of soft shelled, broken, tiny frozen crawfish.   I'm originally from Houston TX and is a hardcore crawfish Lover. I know my Crawfish. I should of asked her to show me one live crawfish to prove it.   Note to Kristina: 1) it is NOT crawfish season 2) Dont lie and tell someone your  crawfish is alive and fresh when it is really frozen.  3) you can easily tell frozen crawfish from fresh crawfish.  No need to lie, it just makes you look like a pathetic liar.   How to quickly tell frozen crawfish from fresh live crawfish: 1) Frozen: shell is soft, Cracks and beaks easily.  Shell  can almost be paper thin.  Live: shell is hard and firm. Color is dark red and vibrant.  2) Frozen: meat breaks apart in pieces.  Live: meat is like fresh shrimp.   I also ordered lemon pepper mussels, which were extra salty and punched a stack of high blood pressure and stroke if I ate any more.   I advise people to go to the Glendale location vs  Tempe. They are more honest and will charge for the correct product they sell.  They are not devious and misleading Like Kristina at station 5 working at 7:52pm on 2/23."}
{"text":"Love Hot n Juicy! Especially a fan of their crab. This food is not for those who don't like to get messy or who don't like spicy food. I get baby spice and it's still spicy for me."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the service. My first visit was the best that was the reason for my return visit. I drove to Vegas from CA. And refused to leave until I visit. The servers stated they were tag team servers, yet we waite d for a long period of time."}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed going to hot and juicy but this time was Awesome!   Not only was the food great but our waitress Jessica and Aubree were on their game.  They were attentive, friendly and engaging.  They really made the whole experience great.  Way to go Jessica and Aubree!"}
{"text":"Took really long to get food, over 30 min at Lunch.  Only 3 tables sat in place.  Food Marginal. Waitress Nice"}
{"text":"Love me some Hot N' Juicy!!!! Quick update to yesterday's visit to HNJ with my younger brother. Took him their for a quick bite and he loved the crawfish and shrimp in garlic butter (mild; I usually prefer spicy). I noticed a few new employees since my last visit. They waitress was very polite and held a quick conversation while taking our orders. Service was prompt and the food was up to its usual greatness; all around fantastic once again at Hot N Juicy!"}
{"text":"I love hot&juicy crawfish but what i dont like about them is they open at 12.  I wish they open at 11."}
{"text":"Frequent here at least once a month. Great food, great service. First place I've ever tried crawfish, I think I like their frozen ones better than their fresh. They peel apart much easier when they're frozen.   We sometimes go with the whole lobster(can't go wrong there) but always get a pond of green mussels, shrimp and snow crab.   I love spicy food, but we usually stick with mild here so that we don't lose the taste of the fish.   Corn fritters are awesome but very filling. For carbs, we usually get a few potatoes or the dinner rolls to sop up that delicious sauce.   Favorite sauces and most flavorful to me are the lemon pepper and juicy Cajun.   Not one bad thing to say about this place! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"You sick and tired of the regular food in Vegas?  Come to Hot N Juicy!! To eat yo seafood crawfish, crab and shrimp. Very affordable and very delicious.  I think I spent more money on getting a cab there and back to my hotel then eating there. Will definitely go there next time I am in Vegas!!!!"}
{"text":"I've driven past this place about 50 times, thinking...\"I wonder if it's any good or am I going to be sick as a dog after I throw my money away?\"  I am more than happy to say this place is awesome.  It's also packed!  Lot's of spice choices on the menu, lot's of variety of mud-bugs, crustaceans, shellfsh and such.  Also lots of sides, in Southern Style.  It can be messy, so if you take a date here make sure it's like your guys 20th date or so.  Because your hands are going to be covered in hot spices (even with the gloves) and it's a pretty messy/smelly affair, great...but messy.  I never tried it at the other location but I was more than pleased with this one.  The wait staff is awesome, more than willing to make sure you are okay and need anything, they are on top of it, even if they aren't your server they are checking on everyone.  If you have been wishy-washy in the past, don't dally any longer, this place rocks!"}
{"text":"Like always I love hot and juicy. It's amazing all the locations I visited in Vegas have consistently good flavors. I love their shrimp here so fresh and delicious! I'm not gonna order live crawfish next time because it's so hard to get the whole tail meat out for some reason. frozen one was easier to get the meat off the shell. But the waitress didn't mention frozen or fresh crawfish choice upon my ordering. anyways but she's very attentive. Love H&J!"}
{"text":"Love the food! Order 1 pound crawfish and 1 pound shrimp hot n juicy flavor. Level spicy. I'm actually love their sauce. Perfectly balanced. Only reason 3 stars is because we feel like not quite welcoming with the service. Not a single smile I can count. I hope it's just C she's not having a good day."}
{"text":"I went here a few months back, around the end of May. From what I can remember I totally enjoyed it. I got the 2lb crawfish cajun style and the bf got some sort of fried platter with fries.  I don't remember if this place gives you the option of choosing live or frozen, but these crawfish were definitely big.  Both entrees were really tasty and was great to wash down with a couple of Coronas.   Side note: As much I love munching down on some crawfish, I absolutely hate the fishy smell it leaves on your hands. My recommendation? Be the loser who uses the gloves ;)   Yes, I am that loser."}
{"text":"Went to dinner there this past sunday. First let me say the food is amzing so delicious......the service not so much. We waited 15 min for our sodas and then were served them twice because of miscommunication between the servers. We order crawfish, rolls, and crab legs.....crawfish came right away.....we had to ask 3xs for our rolls....and were told our crab would be out momentarily. We eventually got our rolls we asked for buter and were tolf they only had melted butter not cold. After 45 min they asked did we need anything else and we said we are still waiting for our crabs. They went to check and the kitchen forgot to cook them. So after another 20 min they finally came out and we were told they would comp the crab. When we got the bill we were still charged. We had to go find the original waitress (as we had 4 different ones) and she was like oops. So after they fixed that with the manager we finally left after being there for close to 2 hours. Like i said great food just not the best service. Woukd definitely do take out nect time."}
{"text":"Went to HnJ#2 on a Friday for lunch and it wasn't crowded at all. We sat at the booth which was nice and comfy. However, getting up out of it was a little hard, because the padding of the seat stuck to my legs. lol  The servers were nice and friendly and may i say good looking ;)  I ordered : Calamari Fries Fried Shrimp 1lb of Lousiana style shrimp 2 lbs of Crawfish (1lb LOUISIANA style, 1lb Lemon Garlic)  Overall, the food was good. The problem is, I had so much garlic, that i had hot garlic breath all night long.. even after brushing a couple times..  My advice.. get something that's not garlicky =P but i think that would be tough..   Enjoy your crawfish! I know i i enjoyed all of it!!!"}
{"text":"Management reached out to apologize and offer us a brownie. I don't want a free food. I want better service."}
{"text":"The only time I eat a pound plus of food is when I come here! My favorite thing to get is the One Pound bag of Shrimp, Hot N Juicy Special flavor, Extra Spicy. I've tried the other different flavorings but this is by far my favorite. They also have clams, oysters, crab legs, french fries, sweet potato fries, rice, chicken nuggets (for your non-seafood loving friends that tag along), crawfish and other fixings.   In my opinion, this location by Decatur, is better than the one off of Valley View or off Eastern.  If you've never been here before, be prepared to use your hands and get messy. My \"system\" is to lay a couple sheets of paper towels underneath the bag of shrimp to absorb any stray sauce drippings so it doesn't drip off the table and into my lap. I also have my orange soda with a straw within drinking distance so I don't have to grab the styrofoam cup and get sauce all over it. After I put my plastic bib on, I put lemon juice on my fingers and wipe them off, then put the gloves on. After I'm done eating, I put more lemon juice on my fingers to help remove the smell of skrrrimps and seasoning and then wash my hands.   Anyway, the food is really good. Everything is tasty. Service is always pretty decent. Whenever I need my fix, I come here!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat hands down! It's fun and such a great place to experience, instead of having your food handed to you, you have to work for it. The customer service is great as well, they teach you how to open things if you need help."}
{"text":"When you just want lots of shellfish and a casual setting you must go here. We ordered the Crawfish, shrimp, and crab legs, all great. We went with the hot and juicy, Cajun, and garlic butter sauces all in mild and they were plenty spicy! It's fun to just talk and peel! It's a busy place and casual so don't expect 4 star service but the girls are nice and you can just flag someone down if you need a refill or reorder. We also ordered the calamari, sweet potato fried, rolls and rice. The side of rice is enough for 2 to share unless you just love rice haha. The fries and calamari were ok I don't think I'd get them again. They also have fresh oysters! I'm not a huge seafood person but I still had fun and plan to go back. Don't be snooty, tie on the apron, be patient and enjoy a lazy afternoon of conversation and crustaceans!"}
{"text":"Recommend by my client,  I wanted something different off the strip and I love seafood and Cajun... When they say hot and juicy that's says it all... they were out of fresh crawfish but the frozen was good.. I was told to call ahead and make sure fresh crawfish was available..  I highly advise using gloves to eat... the juice piped in my eye... experience overall was great... will revisit"}
{"text":"I love seafood so was excited to find this place. It was a total disappointment. It took forever to get refills on our water. The portions are tiny for the price. They don't have a very big selection to choose from. Service was terrible. We won't be going back for a 2nd visit"}
{"text":"Don't recommend the Crawfish, there is barely any meat inside and are extremely tiny. Shrimp is my favorite, their Hot n Juicy sauce in Medium had the perfect amount of nice spice in it to kick up the flavor.  The wait for our food was not fun. About 25 minutes for them to bring out 2 lbs of shrimp. THEN, it took 40 minutes for my baby brother's chicken tenders to come out, which we had to speak to management about. But they took it off the bill for us which we appreciated.  Also, our given wait time was 5 minutes, but we sat in 15. We were not happy. As a word to management, it is always better to overestimate a wait time than have crowds of hungry, unhappy guests.  Most likely will go to a new location next time."}
{"text":"Stay in a hotel nearby on vacation. I have been to one of these in the DC area and wanted to go back. I loved the location of this one. Went around lunch time during the week it wasn't overly busy. Waiter was good recommended some things to help us out. Food was really good! Would definitely go back if ever in the area. Would love them to open some locations in the Midwest!"}
{"text":"No plates, no utensils and absolutely NO SERVICE.   Positives: 1.  Getting notified by text that table is ready worked well 2.  Shrimp and lobster tasted good (when the finally arrived)  Negatives: 1.  Service was horrible. We saw the manager fielding complaints from other customers, so we know we were not the only ones.      - We sat for 20 min before ever seeing our waitress    - Drink refills were inconsistent.  Not good when eating spicy food.    - Two of our meals arrived at the same time.  The third meal arrived 20 minutes later and the the last meal arrived 10 minutes after that. 2.  For the non-seafood eater, you don't have many real options.  You can get bland chicken wings (they don't serve them with any sauce, just simple fried wings).  I ended up eating the sausage as my meal.    Overall, it was an interesting ONE TIME experience.  We won't be repeat customers."}
{"text":"The food is delicious. I have been here several times and they have made a mistake or two, but to their credit, they correct the issue and make things right.  We love this place!"}
{"text":"This place was bomb!!! Located right off the strip at Planet Hollywood. You have to enter on the street side (Harmon Ave). This was a great late night treat. The food was delicious. I created my own bag with Sausage, Corn, Potatoes, and Snow Crab Legs and the combination of all the sauces. I will definitely go back the next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"The food was mediocre, the service was exceedingly awful, and my table wobbled like the Titanic! I spoke to a manager by the name of Gabby, she apologized and said there was no excuse for the shoddy service I received, and she made an attempt to make it right. I'll be back to give it another try, but only because of Gabby. On another note, I've been to their location at Westgate in Glendale and it was tons better than this. I'll give it another review when I try it again, I hope I'm not just a sucker...."}
{"text":"I come into Hot N Juicy every Sunday night with my roommates for good food and a better atmosphere and have yet to leave unsatisfied.   They have an abundance of fresh seafood with a lovely assortment of seasonings that caters to almost everyone. The food is always on point, I highly recommend the Dungeness crab. It is very reasonably priced and you won't get a better crustacean anywhere around Tempe.   Along with the food, the staff is always friendly and super eager to make your dining experience everything you want it to be. Their good attitude and incredible work ethic is contagious and makes me look forward to my Sunday evenings at \"The Juice\""}
{"text":"I ate there last night the food was really good. The spices are amazing. I like spicy food and the mild was just enough for me. I highly recommend you wear extra gloves instead of just the one pair. The lobster was a very good size for the price. If I could have only one negative complaint, it would be that the lobster price said by pound on the menu. However they had only purchased whole lobsters that day so you had to buy the whole lobster for double the pound price. The seafood was fresh and I will definitely be going back!!"}
{"text":"Very unprofessional. The gal in the front pick and chooses who she wanted in the restaurant . She said we needed a t shirt and we CLEARLY all had a cover top . But yet a gal in the booth had a swim suit top and said she \"had a crop top\" and the gal in the booth ADMITTED she had NO problem when was sitting With her bikini top . The receptionist also grabbed my phone because she knew she was wrong . I hope the regional manager sees this . Because what she did was NOT right . We all know it's Las Vegas and it's 104 degrees . Do she want me to have a sweater on or what ? Please have an explanation for me managers . No excuses for this ."}
{"text":"One pound of shrimp. Hot n' Juicy sauce. Medium. And a side of corn. That's all you need to leave here stuffed out of your mind. The scent of their cajun sauce will creep up on you for the next 24 hours and will stay on your fingers for a few days no matter how much you scrub it off. Quite frankly, though, why would you want to get rid of it?   I've never been to Boiling Crab so I have nothing to compare to, but the Hot n' Juicy sauce is out of this world. Garlicy, sweet, spicy, savory, and any other cajun-related flavor sensation imaginable is packed into it. Shrimp is the way to go to get the most value. Why would anyone want to pay for a pound of crawfish and end up eating only 1/4 of it?   Service is so-so. Since this location is smaller than its counterpart down the road, it can get pretty packed. Make a reservation ahead of time or prepare to wait at least 45 min for a large group like we did. Although the waitresses seem to be doing the best they can, they screwed up one of our orders and made it seem like they were doing us a favor by fixing it later. Not the greatest way to handle a situation...  I'm with Adam Richman 100% of the way when he said \"I could sit here eating some of the best crustaceans in the country all day.\""}
{"text":"To top off an eventful Vegas weekend, we decided to come to Hot N Juicy and see how they do cajun seafood in Sin City. To my surprise, this location was not very packed on a Sunday afternoon, and there was plenty of seating, even for our group of 12.  The best bang for your buck at places like this is shrimp. When you get crawfish, you're throwing half of your money away because you can only eat the tail. Not worth it. I got a pound of Hot N Juicy Special Shrimp, Medium Spicy with a side of corn. The shrimp here are a hefty size (I'd say size 16/20) and the sauce is outstanding. I tend to stay away from spicy food, but even Medium was just the right level. If you get mild, the spice is nonexistent. A good combination of flavors that matches the shrimp well.   The employees are all very friendly and highly efficient. Our orders came out within 10 min and water was constantly refilled. Our waitress, Loreal (Never heard that name before, but that's what my friend said was on her name tag), did a fantastic job with our large group, and managed to throw in a few jokes here and there. It's hard to find real down to earth wait staff these days, but she's an exception.   Overall, I was left stuffed, barely able to walk, and very satisfied. Best of all, there was no London Blitz to follow it, if you know what I mean."}
{"text":"I have yet to try the lemon pepper. I want to. But I'm so in love with the hot n juicy special.   We have gone to the other location many times. We choose to go to this one because it's a little newer.   I always get either shrimp or mussels. Hubby always, always gets king crab legs.   You must get the corn in the bag. And rolls.   Just be prepared for garlic to ooze from your pores!  I like it spicy and always get medium."}
{"text":"The experience of this place was what I enjoyed, not so much the food. Salt, salt, salt. I typically enjoy a low sodium diet with lots of veggies, so you can understand why a restaurant of fried and sodium filled proteins might not appeal to me. But the plastic covered tables and the bibs and plastic gloves and giant bags of super saucy seafood drowning in butter and garlic that you smash and eat with your fingers is just a fun way to spend the evening. I definitely enjoyed watching my friend get covered in seafood and Cajun sauce (literally covered, I was wiping it out of her hair and armpits, though in her defense she'd had 3 beers after an afternoon of champagne).   The service is spot on with the exception of waters. They'd much rather serve you beers than keep the water cups filled. But very friendly wait staff. We had the Cajun calamari, which tasted like spicy Cheetos, and the corn fritters, which were very good. We ate the king crab and clams in garlic butter medium spice. It was too much spice and salt for me and I couldn't help my friend eat the pound of crawfish. Also, the crawfish faces creeped me out. We both were burping garlic for 2 days after.   I personally won't be eating here again. Once home I dove into a salad faster than a fat kid with cake. I'm obviously not their target audience. But I recommended this place to my brothers and I think it'd make a fabulous first date location. What better way to really get to know someone than to see how they handle being showered in seafood sauce."}
{"text":"I like their spices in their crawfish . It was very expensive and the service was kinda bad. The waitress was rude to us and she took a long time to take our order. One time I ordered a to go and the shrimp they gave us was old and mushy. You can tell that the to go food they were giving you was old. I will come back if I have enough to pay for their pricey food and if they are consistent in giving fresh seafood even for to go customers."}
{"text":"The food is RIDICULOUSLY GOOD - worth 5 star. The mild is still pretty spicy, so don't be fooled. Best place to get seafood in the rough in Vegas. Not a pretty place, just a hole in the wall with alot of tables squished inside. AWESOME catfish. Best I've eaten, doesn't manage to taste like dirty dishwater. The crawfish is worth the try, even if you think you don't like it. Try a pound (~$12). If ordered when they are in peak season, they are huge and succulent. If you are hesitant, order the shrimp (but alas, they are also head-on.)  Great spot to take visitors, but be careful. During peak mealtimes the wait is horrendous. Take-out is a good option. It's still hot by the time you get it home anywhere in the valley.   The service is usually pretty good, but always so busy. It would be nice if they expanded somehow. An outdoor eating area would be great or at least a sitting area. There is no indoor standing area, or paging system. Most people stand outfront in large groups or have to wait in the car. Also parking is a big pain in the *ss, so be sure you aren't running late for your date, it may take you a bit time to find a spot on a different local street."}
{"text":"This place is off the strip a bit, but worth it if you are jiving for some crawfish and you live on the wrong side of the dixon-mason line.  This place is located in a small strip mall like many others in the Asian part of town, keep driving past the Pho shops and the Chinese restaurants and you are here.  This is not your \"traditional\" crawfish, it keeps a lot of the traditional flavors but throws in some Southeast Asian flair.  I got the two pounder of crawfish, got couple of beers,  rolled up my sleeves literally but the bip and went to town on those bad boys.  I go the Hot and Spicy and it was the right about of heat in it for me, if you know what the jucieness from the head of the crawfish tastes like than you know what I am talking about, tons of shrimp like flavor juices with the spices, and since this reciepe has tons of butter it creates a layer that stays on the shell which ups the calories, cholesterol, and saturated fat but takes the flavor up too.  The corn was a bit overdone though, the potato was good but only two little pieces.  This gets me a bit because corn and potato are cheap but tasty bits and yet they skimp on it.  Everything was good besides the corn and potato.  They should have a sign that tells you what the market price is before you order because $12.99/lb??"}
{"text":"I love me some hot and juicy. Garlic butter baby spice snow crab legs.. The one in Henderson is cool."}
{"text":"Food and service was great again tonight.  Place was busy with wait times around 20 minutes,  well worth the wait.  Looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Another great meal, I would attach a photo but we ate all the food and left a table full of mess. Absolutely delicious. Looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"The review of the place is to talk about experience, customer service, quality of food and management.   First, the wait for a party of 6 was about 10 minutes or so. We went to dinner for a friend's birthday as she wanted to go there.   When we got there, drink orders were taken then the entrees.   The server was also the manager, name tag said team lead of Tad.  He did forget one of the girl's order of her beer so he took care of it and she had to tell him after she got her rice and everyone got their water and Dr. Pepper drinks.   The appetizer came out of the fried catfish. The fried catfish tasted very good with the squeeze of lemon and tartar sauce.   When the entrees came out 5 of the 6 people got their order except me. I was sitting with no food in front of me and gave Tad about 5 minutes and I had to get his attention as another table got their full order (4 of them) and I said \"I didn't get my food yet\" and Tad response was \"what did you order again?\"  For the team lead to have etiquette of asking what I ordered and not apologizing when I was sitting there without any food in front of me was the wrong approach. Simply apologize and check on it.   When he comes out he said it usually takes 2-3 minutes longer based on the crawfish then I waited 5 minutes and he comes out again saying the cook or someone in the back dropped the food. I'm starving while my 5 friends are like halfway done or close to being done. I commend Tad for saying \"what can I do to make your experience better?\" He did well by listening to the customer and was apologetic when he sees I have no food and it sounds like excuses of why my food was over an hour late from when we sat down. I did get my order fully comp (free) and taken care of.   The Get Your Feet Wet was ordered which has 1 lb of crawfish, 1 lb of shrimp, dozen of Andouille Sausages, 2 corns and 2 potatoes. I was eating longer because I got my order so late and everyone is almost done. I ordered the Cajun medium sauce, which tasted very good (4 out of 5)   I'm still eating and Tad asked the table if anything else needs to be done and I did said water because no one got a refill of their water or Dr. Pepper during this whole hour of sitting and eating.   When the check came around (one bill), I'm eating and I told the others to double check the bill. The Get Your Feet Wet was suppose to be comp (free) but it showed up on the bill and Tad had to do another correction and he gave the whole table a 10% off.   To do a review in short term  Wait time and execution of order (2 out of 5) Customer service and management (3.5 out of 5)  Taste of food (3.5 out of 5)  Averaged out to 3 out of 5   I did mention to Tad that my meal was free but the Get Your Feet Wet didn't come with the corn and potatoes. He did mention there's new cooks and 75% of the night he had to go back there for the corn and potatoes ... Tad did seem very genuine and did seem apologetic once the second or third time he feels he or the place screwed up.  One thing I recommend is for the server with manager (team lead) to be on your toes and go to the table a lot more when multiple mistakes happen. I probably scared Tad with my looks (hungry face with no food) and he seemed to avoid our table a few times and had another server come to our table to ask if everything is okay. We were there practically to their closing time of 10 pm and try to get to know your customer especially when multiple mistakes happen."}
{"text":"Pretty good but felt like crawfish was lacking something. Maybe lack sweetness in the meat or not alot of meat. I dont know what though... good if youve never tried it."}
{"text":"Good seasoning on the crayfish and shrimp. The expensive lobster did not taste as good as the crayfish. Barely any meat in the lobster legs. Some of the crayfish were old since they were soft. Don't use the gloves, it will only get in your way. Eat them while they are hot. Once they are cold, not as good.  The rice was hard and cold for 1 of the 2 bowls. Waiter was friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"Came in to see what the hype was about hot n juicy since SD has only boiling crab. My family and i went on a busy weekend afternoon. Their seasoning was definitely something different and unique compared to boiling crab. Their traditional sit down and eat is quite fun and funny as well. I believe our servers name was La? She got to us quickly after attending her other tables. She asked if we needed help with putting on bib LOL. (You use bibs to prevent yourself from staining your shirt since the seasoning are quite juicy). She recommended the hot n juicy flavor. My whole family loved it.  She also did recommend if you hate spices or are terrible with it, to start at their lowest spice level. Thank goodness for that advice because I was already sweating with the \"premature\" spice aka baby spice. She was super helpful with everything. I would love it if they opened one soon here in Chula Vista or near Temecula!!!"}
{"text":"I've heard a lot about this place, so I was really excited to finally try it.  I was told in advance to get shrimp instead of the craw-fish so you don't have to do as much removing of shells.  The waits are long here and parking is very scarce up front, so be prepared to park on the side street.  The menu is very simple and the waitress is more than willing to explain how everything works.  We ordered a basket of the hot fries for the table and they lived up to their name.  As tasty as they were it's a good thing to split with a group because I imagine they wear on you in the long-run.  I decided on the Hot N Juicy special sauce shrimp.  They bring it out in a hot plastic bag and from there you go to town.  After an intro lesson from someone in our party, I was peeling shrimp faster and faster as the night went on.  It definitely is a lot of work peeling especially when the food is still a little hot, but on the plus side it slows your pace of eating so you don't eat too much!  After all was said and done the food was OK, It's been 3 days and I still have a hint of garlic smell on my hands and the next day when I went for a run my sweat smelled like the sauce!  For all the effort you put in I wish the food was better, but the experience is something to live.  Tip:  Make sure to not wear any fancy clothing and possibly ask for gloves so your hands don't stink for days."}
{"text":"I was in town to visit family and had a family member who recommended dining in at hot n juicy. I'm from SD and so Boiling Crab is more of a thing for us back home. Heads up, I am a fan of Boiling Crab. But I must say I think things have changed. I went in on a busy night and there was a wait. My family and I were hangry! But it was worth the wait. We were greeted right away by a young man name Peet/Peter (i forgot). He took all of our orders very well and our drinks came out fast due to another server name La who accompanied him. Our orders came out quickly; which was surprising because it was a busy night. We were ready to feast! Thankfully we had everything ready to start eating. Gloves, bibs and utensils! Plus the food. My family ordered different flavors. We had Garlic Butter, Lemon Pepper and Hnj. All three flavors were way better than Boiling Crab. Especially the HnJ. My father asked one of our server (La) what was the ingredients for the sauce but she told us it's a secret. Haha. She said if she told us we would never come back. Which is true! It was a seasoning that was FULL OF FLAVOR. Sweet! Spicy! Citrusy! All combined. The shrimps were pretty big! It was well seasoned. Our king crabs were easy to eat and enjoy thanks to crackers and zippers. Besides from their seafood by the pound, MUST ORDER CALAMARI! I don't know what is in it or how they make their calamari but it's just the best calamari I have ever had. It was crispier than BC. Every crunch was perfect. Had to grab the other basket from a family member.  Food was great! It was a more enjoyable atmosphere having kind servers as well. Customer service is a huge thing for my family.. Thanks to the man who got our food right and out right away; Peet. And to our other waitress for being on point with water refills and giving us all the lemons we needed; La. And to the lady who took care of us for the rest of the night; Camille.  We will definitely come back on our next visit to vegas."}
{"text":"Great experience. Excellent food. I had two lbs of the spicy Louisiana style crawfish. They were most excellent.very casual and the waitstaff were good."}
{"text":"A friend of mine has been talking about this place for the year that I have known him!! Over and over he would assure me that we needed to go!  So go we did! And I was not disappointed. The food was good, in a super messy, peel your own stuff kinda way. They do offer gloves, and bibs, etc to reduce the delicious saucy consequences! But I have been to places like this before, I wore clothes that I would toss into the laundry if needed. But I did ok!   We ordered everything with \"Hot and Juicy\" sauce. My friend feels it is the best one, I cannot say, as it was the only one I had. Everything you order comes tightly wrapped in a plastic bag swimming in your sauce of choice. This is sounding fun, RIGHT? Well it is fun, if you let it be! We had a great meal!!  Dinner consisted of... Snow Crab Legs- Yummy! Green Lip Muscles- OK, these were my favorite. Easy to retrieve from the shell, lots of flavor! Really good!! Head on Shrimp - I thought these would be too much work, but I was wrong! They were great! Cajun Fries - Just to ad a little bit of fried goodness to the table. and lastly sliced cajun sausage - These were hands down the dud of the night. Soggy, tasted weird, yuck. I suspect they were old, and sitting in the bag of sauce did not help. Stick to the seafood! Or Fried stuff!!  Over All we had fun and enjoyed our meal. Service was awesome! Would I RUN back? I don't know. Would I go back, for sure!!"}
{"text":"No star if I could. The stench of this place you won t be able to get rid of for days... The food isn't good. If it wasn't for the very hot sauce that masks any flavor you d be able to notice that there is no taste. The shrimps were big but no taste, crawfish, and blue crab were no better. Do your self a favor and pass!"}
{"text":"I think they forgot how a restaurant works. Let me refresh your memory. The menu says what you have, I choose, you cook, I eat, I pay. This was like,  your menu is just suggestions as to what you may and may not have,  in portions you may or may not want. I order, you check and see if it's okay with the cooks, take a while, forget, come back and tell me what I want is only available in 2.5x the size I want ( on the menu as 1lb). Then argue with me, then call someone on your headset as I leave.  Strange concept."}
{"text":"The staff was attentive. The food was awesome. I love the bibs, gloves and plastic tablecloths. It is a family friendly place. Gets crowded quickly but people move through quickly.  Will definitely be returning. I definitely recommend. Prices were very reasonable."}
{"text":"This place looked so good on MVF, I had to come here and try it.   There's two Hot N Juicy Crawfish restaurants less than a mile from each other. The cab driver was a little confused too,  but he said this one was the one that he drops everyone off at.   First off, the servers are very friendly. They might not have been very quick to get our food order or remember to bring everything, but they were all super nice.   There were 6 of us in the group and we decided to order by pairs. It's hard to not share and hard to share with the entire group. You'll see it gets really messy and there's no way of passing things around the table. So the easiest way to eat is to share with the person next to you or across from you.   We ordered the shrimp, crawfish (of course), clams, and king crab legs. You also get a choice of sauce and spiciness. Everyone ordered the hot n juicy sauce (a mix of 3 of the choices). I usually eat my Thai food 4 stars and ordered medium spiciness. It was pretty good for me, although I could have used a little more spice. It might be too spicy for people that don't eat hot foods.   The food comes out in bags and you just dig in with your hands. There's bibs and gloves for everyone (highly recommended). I loved the clams and shrimp. The crab legs didn't have much flavor. The crawfish were just a pain in the ass- a lot of work for nothing. I would probably skip that next time. In fact, everyone in our group was saying how great the food was- EXCEPT for the pain-in-the-ass crawfish :)   I would highly recommend this place. The food is good, service is great, and the atmosphere is so much fun. And prices were not bad if you're used to the astronomical prices on the Strip."}
{"text":"It's exactly the same as the other one down the street. Maybe a little smaller. Just as delicious. It can get quite busy sometimes and may be hard to flag a server down. But totally worth a little side trip from the strip just for dinner."}
{"text":"Next time, can you guys add a little more étouffée to the étouffée please? All we got was all rice slightly covered w/a little étouffée juice. Better service would be a plus as well."}
{"text":"The most accommodating server ever! We loved Robin!!   I was a hot and juicy virgin - Robin eased me into my first experience like a true pro. I didn't come prepared but Robin anticipated my needs and took care of me. I have a lot to learn but I'm hungry for more!    We had a little bit of everything and it was goooood!"}
{"text":"Ahh Hot N Juicy... I'm glad to see you finally expanding to somewhere more than 2 miles away...lol.  This one has the same feel as the others and still leaves you and your clothes smelling like it for the next couple days.  The layout is great... lots of tables with plenty of space; not as cramped as the first one...just as packed though.  Food is the same, nothing changed on the menu.  We did have a little delay with getting our food but that happens with 12 people.    If you are on the south side and was too lazy to drive; now you can get in on what all the talk was about."}
{"text":"Down and dirty! Good eats. Love that they consistently prepare the food the same EVERYTIME. I recommend crawfish, shrimp, calamari and cat fish. Most of everyone I know loves spicy but they all happen to love mild flavor more."}
{"text":"Staff are always friendly. Food is good as well. make sure your ready to roll your sleeves up and get down. Their isn't plates and u eat directly off the table. I use gloves so the spicy items don't stay in your nail beds. They offer bibs which is needed. Tip: The wonderful aroma of food stays with u 10x more then onions on a street taco. I usually leave my purse at home and never wear my leather jacket."}
{"text":"The workers here are very nice and their food here is delicious. We wanted to dine in but unfortunately we got to-go because it was too packed. I was disappointed that it took 45 to get our to-go orders. My advice is to call in and order and just bring it to-go."}
{"text":"Hot N Juicy has the best shrimp! Love this place."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try Hot N Juicy Crawfish, given how well known they are for their crawfish. Unfortunately, I left pretty underwhelmed after my visit last week after trying my Hot N Juicy medium spicy crawfish.  Positives: the flavor was quite good. It had the perfect amount of heat, spice, garlic, and all other types of yumminess. Unfortunately, that's where the positives end.  Negatives: I'll start in chronological order from when I got there. Seeing the 10.99/lb price tag was like a slap to the face! I'm used to paying a fraction of that price for larger, fresher, and equally tasty crawfish. This leads me to my second point: many of the crawfish were mushy, tiny, and some of the tails weren't attached to the heads. Disappointing...  Negatives continued...the service left something to be desired. While the server was very enthusiastic, she had difficulty understanding basic concepts. If you order 2 lbs of the crawfish, you automatically get a potato and corn included with your order. She charged my friend for an extra order of corn and potato to my friend's receipt and could not grasp why this was incorrect. Who knows how many other people have been upcharged for extra corn and potatoes. She didn't know how to remove this from the receipt so my friend ended up paying for something extra she didn't ask for because she didn't want to deal with the headache of explaining this again and again. :/  In summary, it seems like this is a popular place that many people frequent and even give great reviews and high accolades. It may be disappointing for people who have easy access to crawfish, have been to many'a crawfish boils, and know what good crawfish should taste like. I'm glad I had the opportunity to see what all the hype is about, but I'll get my crawfish-fix elsewhere."}
{"text":"Banging a$$ Seafood!!!  I love for this place and will def be back when I'm in Vegas.  There's one open in WeHo also so maybe I'll just go there!  Hot n Juicy flavored Snow Crab is the best, also the Lemon Pepper shrimp!  Don't waste the juice!!  Pour it over the white rice and simmer the flavor!"}
{"text":"This 4 stars is for the flavor it was awesome unless I was really hungry anyways service is kinda off if that makes any sense..I'm a server myself at a restaurant I'm usually by myself so when it get busy sometimes I tend to get all over the place but it's because I'm by myself..I'm not perfect,but here at HnJ I'm watching 8 servers that's all over the place kinda weird anyways best of luck to them lol p.s. Thanks to the guy that took our order he's from Hawaii and he's really nice forgot his name"}
{"text":"Everything was good as usual but I can never get full even if I eat rice...I also force my kids to eat rice with it as well so they can get full but they never eat their rice!! We were at the door before they opened lol that's how long I've been craving this!! Fresh everything and our server was really nice I believe her name was Andrea or draya really attentive and sweet anyways kudos to u hnj love giving u guys my money so worth it lol"}
{"text":"When I was visiting AZ this week, I was so pumped to bring a friend of mine here since he's never been to Hot and Juicy. We came in on Tuesday so it wasn't too busy. I'm a huge fan of the Las Vegas locations so I thought this would be no different. Boy, was I in for a rude awakening.   First, the service. I thought the service was fantastic. Really attentive, and always had refills on my water. The food came out a little slow, but no biggie because I figured it's worth the wait.    Next, FOOD! My absolute favorite thing about Hot and Juicy is their shrimp. Usually, such good flavor, I keep it simple with my seasoning and order sauce on the side for dipping. (Hot N Juicy, Spicy-Can't go wrong) as far as the sauce goes, spot on and literally just like Vegas, maybe a touch spicier but, I'm not complaining. My biggest complaint was the shrimp itself. It literally tasted like MUD and water. It was so incredibly disgusting. It literally had no flavor, was soft, and just, BAD.  Next up, we got the snow crab and mussels. The mussels were really good, but the snow crab was the saltiest thing I've ever tasted. As soon as I put it in my mouth, I was ready to spit it out. I sat there in disbelief and embarrassment. My friend was asking me why the heck I even brought him here. And unfortunately, I was asking myself the same question.  Needless to say, my friend isn't coming back here after such a terrible experience with the food! And now I'm worried about visiting my local Las Vegas locations."}
{"text":"I stepped in to this Hot N Juicy last weekend to complete my experience at all three locations in Vegas. Not sure if this location is owned by someone different than the other two in Vegas because it was a not-so-good experience. Everything from the service, to the food was just meh.  My absolute favorite thing about Hot and Juicy is the fries, oysters, snow crab, and the corn. Starting off the with cajun fries, the tasted the same - no difference, but how can you really screw up fries??? Next, the snow crab. It was sooooooooo BAD!!! There was no meat inside, it was smaller, the meat was so salty it made me want throw up and the white part of it looked moldy and disgusting. It was green and black, so disgusting and it left us with a sick stomach. As we were breaking them, there was never any meat inside of them. What's the point? This place is expensive and to get empty snow crab seriously enraged me. Next, the oysters. I' was pleasantly surprised with the oysters. They tasted very fresh and didn't even need hot sauce to slurp down! Lastly, the corn. It just wasn't good. Period. The kernals were small, it wasn't juicy and biting into it felt like it was just all core.  All of these lead me to believe that the owners are different because it seems like they're using all different things. I say, stick to the chinatown locations. Haven't been there in a while, hopefully things haven't changed."}
{"text":"One of the best seafood spots in Vegas in my opinion. The service is, mediocre. At best. But there's really nothing better than tearing into some crab with your friends while drinking a beer.   We started off with the calamari, it was tough and chewy. The battering was great, but the calamari itself tastes terrible and had a bad consistency. I think they have some of the best fried shrimp in Vegas! Great taste and ask to have some hot n juicy spicy on the side for dipping the shrimp and everything else!   The snow crab and shrimp were by far the star of the show for me. The shrimp was soooooo good. Firm and delicious, and much easier to peel open than the ones I've had a the other Cajun spots in Vegas. The snow crab was huge and really amazing in flavor. Full of meat and easy to crack open. I asked for a second order of snow crab with no sauce because I loved the taste of the crab and liked to dip it myself into a side of sauce. Don't forget to order corn and potato in the bag!  Overall, this has to be my favorite Cajun spot in Vegas, by far! Great restaurant to come to with the family and get messy! Great seafood, great experience, and great sauces!"}

{"text":"When I hear the term 'hot and juicy', crawfish is the last thing that comes to my mind so when I heard about a restaurant called \"Hot and Juicy Crawfish\", I had to check it out. I had heard that it was casual, not too expensive for seafood and had an interesting approach to service. We went there Monday night for dinner with our boy, Sean, who was visiting from So. Cal. We found the restaurant on the sleazy edge of Chinatown in a small strip center next to a Chinese massage parlor and a karaoke bar. Didn't look to special on the outside but even out in the parking lot, we could smell the garlic in the air.  We went in and it was equally unimpressive inside but we were greeted pleasantly and seated quickly by the window under the neon light....ah, ambiance. The table was covered with a thin plastic tablecloth and contained only a roll of paper towels. The slender menu listed a variety of shellfish, crab, shrimp and, of course, crayfish, all of which are ordered by the pound. Side orders were limited and included mostly corn on the cob, rice and french fries or potato. We ordered the crayfish with Cajun sauce, shrimp with lemon-pepper sauce and blue crab with the garlic sauce. You can order any sauce from mild to paralyzing spicy. We went with mild which turned out to be pretty spicy on its own accord.  The food comes out piping hot, almost too hot to touch; dropped unceremoniously on the table all tied up in a plastic bags with all that sauce. You open the bag and dig in with your hands...no tableware of any kind except for a cracker for the crab.  As to the quality of the food...delicious...hot and juicy. All the sauces were fabulous. The crayfish is something we'd not order again, although it was fun to eat. You have to be a real 'crayfishianado' to suck the juice out of the heads like some do (we won't). So that leaves you with the tail which contains about a  \" piece of meat that took more work than it was worth to get to. The shrimp (head, shell and tail intact) were fabulous. Twist the head off, peel the shell and eat to your hearts content. We also tried a fried dish...breaded soft shell crab which was served with french fries...also delicious.  If you are looking to take people out to an impressive 'Vegas-style' food event, this is definitely not your place. But, if you want an inexpensive place with wonderful seafood, and don't mind getting your hands a little dirty, then I highly recommend it. It would be a blast to go to with friends who are laid-back and have a good sense of humor."}
{"text":"Dinner tonight was so delicious and spicy I had the Catfish, Cajun fries, Cajun Shrimps and Snow Crab legs lets not forget bout the mild Corn on cob..I'm so full.. I would recommend this place for ur seafood spot. Nick, Rich was my waitresses for tonight they are sooooo fiinnnee ...  Especially that Rich lol ....But yeah the food was good.. A1.. Customer service with them fine white men A1..."}
{"text":"saw this place while i was driving to get lunch across the street.  ended up eating less at lunch so i could try some crawfish, despite the 100+ degree weather.  lol.  decor is simple...reminds me alot of the places down in new orleans.  you're reminded that you're there for the food.  plastic on the tables and a roll of paper towels lets you know that you're in for a messy (but good) time.  plastic bibs are a nice touch, too.  the crawfish were very good-sized, some almost as big as a palm.  very meaty.  the drinks are bottomless, which is good for some ppl that can't take very spicy food.  the waitress did a great job explaining all the different sauces they had (there's a good number of them).  we tried both the garlic and the hot-n-juicy.  the hot-n-juicy is a combo of the garlic and cajun, so that's prob the best bet, as crawfish need to be spicy.  the medium-spicy barely registered for me.  the extra-spicy was somewhat mild, compared to new orleans.  apparently there's also an extra-extra-spicy, too, but i didn't want to risk the rest of my group's taste buds.  the only complaint i would have is that there is a strong raw-garlic flavour to the sauces.  if you don't like that, then i'd say you're not gonna like this place."}
{"text":"First, I've never seen so much wasted food packaging in my life! I'm smiling when saying that humorously, but it's true!!! Styrofoam cups. Styrofoam bowls. Plastic bags. Paper napkins. Plastic table cloth.   Things to note- if you just got your nails did and are craving your seafood boil fix, never fear. Ask for plastic gloves. My mom brings her own dishwashing gloves to crawfish boils, but they will provide you some plastic ones upon request.   Took Yelper advice and got half a pound of shrimp. Shrimp were slightly overcooked. After you peel it, dunk it around in the sauce so it can get more flavor on it! Sauces are nice.   We also got the fried cajun calamari, and it's really not good... just generic fried frozen calamari that is overly tough. Don't get that.  Crawfish itself is not in season now, so expectation management is always important. They will likely inform you that it is frozen. A pound of it won't get you very far though.    Some of the girls working there will tell you \"mild\" is actually \"medium\" for most people, but I would disagree. Mild tastes like \"mild\" with just a minor punch to it.  Service was great. The girls working were all very sweet and nice.  For calamari, half a pound of shrimp, a pound of crawfish, a half order of sausage, two potatoes, and a Diet Coke, our total was $33 before tip. It's not exactly cheap for frozen seafood. A fun experience for locals that have no where else to turn for a seafood boil, but a little on the price-heavy side."}
{"text":"Warning: Do not wear White.  Wear something you don't mind getting messy.  Oh... and if you have any little cuts or pick your cuticles... you'll feel the sting from the hot sauce.   So... as you walk in, you notice that all the tables are covered with white plastic and everyone is wearing bibs and most are wearing gloves.  Right off the bat, you know this is going to be an culinary adventure in some messy eating.  And oh man is it.  The menu is pretty simple... mostly shellfish... so if you are allergic I suggest you stay FAR away from this place.  They don't have salads on the menu... or really any type of veggie other than corn and potatoes... nothing green anyways.  So, don't go expecting to get a side salad with your shrimp.  You can get rice, french fries, sweet potato fries, hush puppy-like dish and bread to help soak up all the yummy sauce.  We got 1 lb each of shrimp and king crab legs with the Hot and Juicy sauce, Mild.  Their Mild is like most other places Medium.  It's got a nice kick to it and after eating a couple pounds of shellfish... your mouth is \"warm\".  (Good thing that Nielsens Frozen Custard is in the same shopping center.)  So you eat the shellfish with your hands... Peel and Eat right from the bag. They serve it to you in big plastic bags.... no platters... no plates.   They do have plastic spoons for the rice tho.  The sauce is Great!  And I want to go back and try the Lemon Pepper which I hear is really great too!  The shrimp and crab legs were meaty and had good texture... but it's all about the sauce and the experience.  We had fun playing with our dinner... and because you eat slower... you get full faster.  So, I think that's a good thing, right?  :)  Service was super friendly.   This would be fun with a group of people."}
{"text":"Love the food, hate the service.  Today was my second time coming here, the first time was over the weekend at night and it was bad.  Orders were messed up left and right.  I was dying to give it a second chance.    The shrimp came in a timely manner along with the rice.   I went for the rice and it was hard, like uncooked.  I'm usually understanding but.... ANYONE scooping that rice from the cooker to the container must've struggled enough to realize this should not have been served.  I called the server over and they took it back.  She came back and said that something was wrong with the rice cooker and that it may take 15 minutes for the next batch to come out.  I didn't really have a choice.  Then some lady came and offered us hawaiian rolls.  Keep in mind that while waiting for that, we did not touch the shrimp.  We're asians so rice is really important, lol.  15 minutes passed = no rice and no rolls.  I was starting to get irritated and I was hungry so we just ate again, without any of what was promised.  What you'll notice about the servers: 1) They hover by the kitchen... trying to avoid or delay the bad news they have to deliver  2) They'll ask how you're doing but very few genuinely care  3) They'll say they'll check on it and will only remember to tell you their findings WHEN you call them over again.  Aren't you supposed to return from your mission?  Lol.  The rolls finally came - only three by the way for two people (which was supposed to make up for the uncooked rice we both bit into??  And have been missing since??). This was on the house so that was generous *sarcasm*.  Rice was 1.99 each and we ordered two.  That's $4.  Rolls are $1.75 for three.  Whatever.  They were just like the kind you buy at the store, except warmed up.  I don't know why it took that long.  By the time we were told the rice was on its way, we already finished the shrimp.  So the rice would have been useless.  IMO:  Food is good.  Customer service sucks."}
{"text":"We arrived right before closing and was still treated with great service. I ordered the shrimp med in heat and that was spicy but good.  My only issue was the raw oysters,  they taste funny and had a weird texture to them. Other than that food and consumer services was good"}
{"text":"Best crawfish in town, but I just wish that they cleaned the shrimp because the vein is still in them."}
{"text":"They were out of craw fish an hour after opening!! Disappointed!!"}
{"text":"It was great. Went to eat crawfish and got my fill! Crawfish were good, service was outstanding and friendly. Matt was knowledgable and made good suggestions. Ate 4at Lbs, each different combos of spice and sauces. My favorite was, Louisiana Style Spicy. I thought the medium wasn't spicy enough and didn't try the Extra Spicy. Each 2nd pound comes with free piece of corn and potato. I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Wanted to get out shrimp on for my wife birthday. It is always busy and we had to wait to be seated and the got use in pretty fast from what they said the wait would be but it's is so worth the wait anyway. 2 lbs lemon pepper ono."}
{"text":"Very unhappy with the customer service at this place, I've been a loyal customer to them since they opened the restaurant in Westgate, and this is the 3rd time of the many visits I have made to the restaurant that I get terrible customer service so decided to leave a review. The staff always has attitude, seems like they get mad when you ask for additional orders or refills, they always take forever to provide refills I have to get up and go to them and request additional thing that my family needs. I was there yesterday and had my mom and grandma waiting for us already seated with a table it was a family get together my grandma is allergic to shrimp so I bought her Canes and took it in the restaurant when I sat down with my two brothers the waitress came and said \"no outside food can't be in the restaurant\" I said \"this is not the first time we eat here and buy Canes for grandma, we all are gonna purchase our food here it's just her that she can't eat seafood\" and she said no sorry you would have to leave. I asked her if I could eat outside and she went to check with her supervisor, she came back and said no sorry you can't eat outside food in the restaurant you would have to leave! I felt so unwelcome and not only that she waited standing by the table for us to completely leave the restaurant. It was not the first time we got something else to eat for my grandma we never got asked to leave with out outside food. Been a loyal customer to Hoy N Juice Crawfish since I was living in Las Vegas and because of the poor customer service and attitude from their serves they lost a customer that used to go to their restaurant at least 4 times a month! And I will make sure to spread the word in social media and to the BBB. Negative 5 starts to their customer service and their attitude. I would understand if she approached to us differently but she mistreated us and made us feel unwelcome!"}
{"text":"Always a big fan of Hot and Juicy's Hot and Juicy Special sauce on anything. LOVE their sausages. so yummy!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Every time we come to Vegas, we have to stop by here. The Hot and juicy flavor is amazing. Like everything in Vegas, the price was a little high. Definitely a place for those who love crawfish and garlic!"}
{"text":"Had a great time. Met up with my mother and aunt at West Gate. Was walking and noticed this new food joint. Never had crayfish before so I wanted to try it out. Service was great and willing to answer any questions. Since I was a virgin, they showed me how to crack open the shell, pull the meat, and suck the head. It was good, but way to much work. We also ordered their sausage. It was awesome, really made the visit worthwhile. Added some of their great bread. Had a great time, don't like how you have to work so much just for a little meat. But the sausage and bread was worth it."}
{"text":"Go to Angry crab which is the same concept but better and cheaper as far as cost. This place was very crowded and the staff although nice took some time to get the drinks out. Our drinks which we ordered fist actually came out after the appetizers. I think this place is way too big of a place for the number of servers."}
{"text":"The food here is great! Extra garlic just the way I like it, I usually get crawfish when I'm there but the shrimp is good too. The only thing is place is lacking is customer service, I felt there was a lot of people who didn't know what they were doing but it might have been because they were busy but whenever I asked a question to my server they kinda just seemed dumbfounded. Great food though"}
{"text":"This place is DELICIOUS!!   The hot n juicy seasoning is so GOOD! The shrimp was tasty as was the crawfish but the dungeness crab was SPECTACULAR! it was so tender, flavorful, and cooked to perfection. Probably one of the best crabs I have ever tasted.  Just thinking about the sauce makes me drool a little bit!  This service was so-so but the food greatly made up for it and I would most definitely come back next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Although the sauce here us tasty,  i was very displeased with the service and waitress/staff. I walked in to place a carry out order and was greeted greeted by a  VERY RUDE waitress. I just had to walk out and decided NOT to order there. I asked the other waitreddwhat was her name and they told me HIEDI. Ugh ifyou have an attitude.. maybe it's time you change job field!! Don't work in a customer service field girl!  I wasnt even giving her an attitude.. she didnt even bother to acknowledge my presence. If you see a customer,  just say welcome and we'll be right with you. They really shouldn't hire girls like that.  They can be rude all they want after work!"}
{"text":"My wife was served her shrimp basket and an hour and a half later I was served my spicy shrimp...how long does it take to cook shrimp?"}
{"text":"There were at least 4 flavors of crawfish to get here. The sauce was good and it did not leave me sick with an upset stomach. The shrimp was yummy too. The mild flavor was lacking taste but that's no surprise."}
{"text":"A fun and unique dining experience, you get to be as messy as you like (would not recommend for a first date, if you're shy! Lol).   You wait up front to be seated, but at this location the wait is never longer than 3 minutes. After you are seated, they start you off with your drinks, bibs, and if you request for them, gloves.   At this location, they have a new spice level! \"Baby Spice,\" right before \"Mild.\" I always take my order mild, which is only at about a 'hot cheetohs' level of spice, so I'm guessing baby spice would not be spicy at all.  My usual order is a pound of mild, garlic butter shrimp with a side of cajun fries and deep fried calamari. If your skin is sensitive like mine, I wouldn't suggest ordering spice levels higher than mild, otherwise your lips will swell!  The service here is average on somedays, good on most. They once gave me a basket of cajun fries with half of the fries being cold. I usually wouldn't mind, but that order was for my boyfriend's mom, so I asked for them to heat it up for us and the waitress seriously rolled her eyes at me! Lol. Which reminds me they gave us those fries when we were almost done with our meal, so you would probably expect them to be fresh in the first place.  Despite all this, I love Hot n Juicy, and will continue to be a regular."}
{"text":"If you're into Cajun food, you'll love this joint. Everything is served Head on Tail on, which is how you know this is real deal. This place will do its best to replicate your southern grandmothers crawdad boil. Simply outstanding, strap a bib on and get after it.   Spring for a lobster, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"If you like crawfish/seafood, and can take some heat, you will love this place.  If you dont like crawfish/seafood, i'm afraid this place will not change your mind.  It's one of those places, \" O i always hate___ now i'm a fan!\"   You buy the crawfish by the pound, and it comes to your table all steamed and evenly garliced.  This is the part where i think non seafood people will never understand.  You rip the lil heads apart from the body and give their brains a good little sucking.  It's absoutely delicious :)  Dont act like a bad ass and feel like you can take the heat, because their HOT is HOT.  No shame in ordering the mild, as it does have  a little bit of kick.   Overall big fan, and would wait come back here with my buddies anytime i'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"This is my first crawfish experience and I had to work through the whole bag alone because my son and fiancé are not into the whole working for their food idea.  I'd say that it was a fun experience.  My fiancé enjoyed his 1 lb bag of garlic butter shrimp even though he's not a fan of shell on and head on shrimps.  My son loved his Cajun fries and we split another lb of hot n juicy special shrimp and we finished everything.  Wow!  Talk about a fun experience, but I managed to break a nail and poked myself a couple of times, but we'd try it again in the near future."}
{"text":"I came on a Tuesday night, and they were slammed. Took ten minutes to get a waitress's attention. They were out of quite a bit of their entres. You get stuff delivered in plastic bags, on a plastic table cloth, or in styrofoam soup cups. There isn't any silverware to speak of that I could see and fountain drinks come the same way. The prices are so-so. I had their etouffe. There's only one, and it's mudbug etouffe over rice. It was reasonably flavored, but over-seasoned with cracked pepper even for a Gulf Coaster. There is lobster, three kinds of crab (two missing, the least inexpensive) and an assortment of sides, like corn, sweet potato fries, and so forth. My limited sampling said that it's over-rated.   Two other clues. The parking lot is tiny and insufficient for a large patronage; parking up the side street if you dare. The waitresses don't really understand their menu, or their ingredients (two different ones). Although they were slammed with people, the waitresses seemed inexperienced and had a lot of stains on their clothes. Busing the tables amounts to lifting off the white plastic table cloths and dumping the trash, I guess. It's like eating on the top of a garbage bag. I expected something more authentic, some semblance of service, and a cut above a pre-trash table setting. You can probably do better elsewhere; this isn't even as good as Joe's Crab Shack. There is no decor save for a few Mardi Gras-ish things they must have found at a party store, has all of the ambience of a WalMart restroom."}
{"text":"The crawfish here were DELICIOUS. And a little warning, please trust them when they tell ya Spicy means SPICY. Believe it or your lips would feel like they are burning.  And their secret recipe (the Hot & Juicy flavor) is the way to go, sooo hot and soooo juicy! =P   Besides the crawfish, their shrimps are also delicious; tender, juicy, and very flavorful as well. We did not try the King Crab leg, which looked amazing when some lady cracked those shells and pulled out a whole long strip of crab meat. Holy cow, wish I could go back now and get some!   Oh oh, and their sweet potato fries are soooo sooo good. It was the first time when I did not find any soggy fries in the bunch and every single one of them was perfectly fried (crispy) and sweet! Oh man...  Besides the food, the service here is very friendly; they are very busy, but everybody still greet the customers with smiles and are knowledgeable with recommendations...another thumbs up. The shadiest part of my dining experience here is that they use all plastic cups for drinks and water. Guess it gives you a seafood shack type of feel and most importantly, easier to clean as they can just wrap everything in the paper table cloths and throw away. Maybe should consider recycling cuz that's just a lot of paper and plastic everyday?   Now that I've done my Let's Save Earth Ad, allow me to HIGHLY recommend this place if you know you are a crawfish fan....a MUST in Vegas."}
{"text":"The service was not good. Our server was in a terrible mood and made no attempt to hide it. She gave us a dirty look when we asked for water and declined soda or beer. While ordering, it was difficult to communicate with the server because the place was so loud. You have to shout to make sure the employees or those in your party hear what you're saying. Then everyone else in the restaurant does the same, which makes for a very noisy place.   I don't really like crawfish because it kind of creeps me out having my food staring at me, but that's my fault, so I won't hold it against them. The crawfish were hot, and they were juicy. I can tolerate SOME heat/spice, so we ordered mild crawfish. The mild is quite spicy, so I think the \"hot\" should probably be illegal. The crab we ordered with only garlic butter. The crab was obviously low quality, probably on par with what you would find at the cheap buffets. It tasted like a mouthful of sea foam. They can probably get away with serving low quality shellfish because most people put on the hot seasoning and can't taste anything else."}
{"text":"This place is ok if you're craving crawfish in 100 degree weather, lol. We ordered the shrimp, crawfish, snow crabs, Fried Calamari, and oysters. They sure love black pepper, but I don't. I felt like it was too much black pepper in everything."}
{"text":"Sorry didnt mean to check into this place, my phone had a mind of its own! I will try it the next time I'm in town though if I remember!!"}
{"text":"update: I would like to update my review now. I was contacted by one of the managers and they apologized for the behavior of their staff. That's the way to care about your business and reputation. I added them two more stars and I would try them again.  This was always one of my favorite places and I'm so sorry that you have made me to write this review but the way we were treated was awful. I have been always a fan of their fresh, juicy and tasteful seafood but this place service is so bad that I would never walk in to this place again. We were a party of 6 people and they forget almost everything about our orders. They forgot the flavor, they forgot to add potato and corn , they forgot level of spice and so on. My girlfriend and I both asked for mild HotnJuicy but received medium. I personally checked three times for our potatoes and we never received them and surprisingly we were charged for that. When I complained about the service one guy which seemed to be the supervisor approached us and reluctantly offered us to take out potatoes from the check!!"}
{"text":"The shrimp is incredible, I can't wait to go back. It is very messy but equally as Delicious!! Make sure to wear the gloves that you will need them"}
{"text":"The staff were kind and friendly, they spent time explaining various choices on the menu.  We finished the first order and placed a second one. Although they forgot to put the sausages, they apologized immediately and brought them to us ASAP.   I would recommend this chain."}
{"text":"Went here with a good friend of mine.   We ordered the Lobster, Mussels, craw fish, fries & oysters.   The Mussels & Lobster were delicious.  The oysters were amazing and very fresh.  (Recommend getting salt and lemon for the oysters plus some cocktail sauce to put on top of them after drizzling the oysters with lemon juice)  Highly recommend putting on the bib and gloves as the food comes out in bags filled with sauce. Can get very messy. Roll up your sleeves and enjoy this mouthwatering meal.   Parking available in the plaza  on either Romaine or Formosa (1 hr free)"}
{"text":"If you're craving seafood dunked in flavorful, buttery, spicy, garlicky sauce... this is your place to go! We flew into Vegas from SFO and was starving from of course, drinking since waaay before we came here. Luckily, this place closes late and we just made it 30 mins before closing! We were welcomed with smiles and a great energy from Ashley and Jeff from the beginning of our services to the time of closing.   1.) Great greetings! 2.) Flavorful sauces & good size shrimps! 3.) Tentative service from the crew 4.) Prompt food service from kitchen to table 5.) & to top it off, diggin' the slow jams!!!  Thank you for fulfilling my cravings!!!"}
{"text":"Man, if this place was only closer to the strip...\"Hot & Juicy Crawfish\" is a solid 4 star on the basis of it's food alone and I'd give it a half-star more if it were within walking distance.   It's a hole in the wall that makes me drool just thinking about it.  If you like crawfish and traditional New Orleans seafood delicacies kicked up a notch with some authentic and lip smacking Louisiana cajun sauce, you're in for a real treat.    So why are you gonna want to try this place?  1) SAUCE The actual reason you're going to this joint is because of the sauce.  Make no mistake - it's the sauce that makes the meal.  Yes, it's great to eat seafood, but their sauce is JUST TO DIE FOR, especially on their crawfish.   ...Now, me personally - I love the Juicy Cajun, but they also have Garlic Butter, Lemon Pepper, Louisiana style, and a Hot & Juice Special.  And they'll spice up the sauce to your liking from Mild to Extra Spicy.  2) CRAB Do you like crab, because, oh, they've got crab.  Four kinds: - Dungeness - Louisiana Blue - Snow/Opilio - Alaskan King They also have softshell crab, shrimp, calamari, and oysters as well if you have a hankerin' for those, but the crab is very tasty and distinctly flavorful for each type.  Even with the sauces, you can very noticably tell the difference between each crab meat.  And it's all sweet and delicious... and steaming hot!  3) CRAWFISH The key is the crawfish though. They're hot and served in a plastic bag on your plastic covered table.  And this is no princess' meal here, folks.  This is down and dirty grubbin'.  Wash your hands before you eat. ...And you have to eat them CORRECTLY.  Tear off the tail, put the WHOLE head in your mouth and crunch down lightly.  This will allow you to suck out all the juice from the crawfish and with the Juicy Cajun sauce...MMMMMMMM is that good.  Then you finish off with sucking out the tail and you're on to the next one. - Live $10/lb - Frozen $6/lb  THE DOWNSIDE:  LOCATION The big problem for me is that this is a $12 cab ride there each way, so you're looking at a $24 surcharge on top of the cost of the crawfish.  It's in the middle of Chinatown in Las Vegas meaning that your first going to have to make the decision whether it's worth your while.  Personally as a foodie, it definitely was, but the cab ride tripled the price of my meal.  CONCLUSION: It's a solid 4 stars on the basis of the food alone - it's just that good.  I'd say this meal was more satisfying than a meal at many casino restaurants on the strip making it also a real value.  Keep in mind - you're not gonna go for the ambiance, the location, or the service.  You'll get served for sure, and that's about all you can ask for because you're basically doing all the work.   I'll definitely be back - especially if I go with a group because I can see how this place would be a LOT of fun in addition to being a great meal.  This was a real delight to have for lunch and I'm glad I made the trek."}
{"text":"FINALLY!  after seeing this on tv and after going to vegas numerous times...i finally was able to get off the strip and make it over here!  was able to cross this off my list!  we came on a saturday night around 6PM.  there was alotta people outside already.  the wait was only about 40 mins. i expected it to be a lot longer!    same concept as our infamous boiling crab.  we had the shrimp and the crawfish in the hot n juicy seasoning = our shabang sauce at boiling crab.  to be honest, if i never ate boiling crab i would prob really like this.  i have to say boiling crab wins though.  our flavors are so much more intense!  we had the an order of fries= ok and the wings were ok..they reminded me of the ones from the lunch truck.  prices by pound were a lot more then what we charge here.   service is pretty good here.  everyone is pretty attentive.    sorry hot n juicy but boiling crab still holds my heart!"}
{"text":"Went to it after seeing it on Man v. Food and it did not disappoint.  Get ready to get messy and don't plan on much after eating other than going home and taking a shower."}
{"text":"Great place.  Service is friendly.  Atmosphere is fun and perfectly set up for a messy, hot and juicy meal.    We got the oysters (huge in size) about $17 for a dzn, very reasonably priced and it was delicious.  How it works:   They sell their crawfish,shrimp,crab,etc. by the lbs.  You get to pick the level of spiciness, and a type of sauce you want to accompany the seafood of your choice.  We chose 1 lbs of shrimp (about$11/lbs) level 3 spiciness in the hot and juicy sauce.  It was amazing, but sauce is heavy with garlic, but I love garlic.  The shrimp was seved head on, served in a plastic bag soaked in in the hot and juicy sauce.  Very flavorful   I recommend getting a side of Sweet potato fries or the an order of the fried soft shell crab (which comes with basket of Cajun fries.)"}
{"text":"The best food and service on the Strip.  We loved it and will be back.  I had the fried shrimp basket.  It was the best seasoned shrimp I've ever had."}
{"text":"Great place to discover SEAFOOD! My family decided to invite me to first DISCOVER and EAT crawfish. Since I was 21 years old, I might as well try my first crawfish at HOT N JUICY Crawfish. THE FOOD WAS TASTY AND DELICIOUS! They put lots of seasoning in order for the flavor of the food to taste GOOD!  The place here is very decorative and has nice employees. The food might take a while but it's worth the wait! I recommend everyone to come and try this place."}
{"text":"its okay...kindy spendy for a little amount of food  spent 22 dollar each person   i got the blue grab and my friend got the 1 lb shrimp plus a dozen oyster...  its good...but its kind of time consuming  oysters are not good....  if you like shrimp and crawfish than its good...  if not... its only going to be okay....I prefer the boiling crab restaurant over hot and juicy"}
{"text":"I lived in Vegas 5 years ago and was SOO excited to try this restaurant while back visiting. Let's just say that two stars is probably generous. My mother and I both ordered the King Crab Legs and half a lb of shrimp each. We also ordered the corn fritters (which were the ONLY good thing about this $100 meal) and sweet potato fries. The \"jumbo\" crab legs which you get THREE of were soggy and almost impossible to crack. I sent my shrimp back bc the texture was so off putting I was scared I'd get food poisoning. It took me asking FOUR times to get a pair of plastic gloves while all the employees stood around and laughed and joked with each other. Save your money, and if you want good seafood, head over to the Bucchanal buffet at the Caesars, where for the same price you can get unlimited hot AND cold crab legs (that they've graciously cut in half for you already) and amazing shrimp. Do NOT waste your time and money on Hot N Juicy. Huge disappointment."}
{"text":"I've had boiling crab, angry crab,hangten, and hot n juicy in my opinion is the best out of all of them. My go to is a lb of shrimp with the hot n juicy medium seasoning with a side of Cajun fries and a bowl of rice. The flavor is great and the food comes out pretty quick. If you're in the mood for shrimp I'd definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"Service improved greatly! Kitchen also kept up with our table and the food came out at a decent pace/time. FOOD WAS FRESH AND WAS GOOD."}
{"text":"This place is reasonably priced. Yes its a chain but it was awesome and clean. Well at least the one on the vegas strip was lol. Customer service was sweet and most importantly the food was great. Ordered snow crab legs and crawfish. Solid seafood in the middle of the desert"}
{"text":"If you've never been to Hot N Juicy,  I highly recommend going.  Hot N Juicy is a restaurant like no other.    A few fair warnings:  be prepared to wait for a table (I waited 35 minutes), if you are sensitive to the smell of garlic and/or fish - stay away, if you're from the Northwest and enjoy spending your time volunteering to help save the environment (just be prepared to see lots of styrofoam and plastic), and if you don't like peeling seafood and eating it with you hands while wearing a bib - go to Red Lobster.  I ordered the one pound shrimp bag, hot n juicy style, medium spiciness - highly recommended!  Once I adopted a proper peeling technique, I began chomping away at the marinated shrimps.  One pound was plenty for me, and since I'm a slower peeler, my stomach filled up by the time I was done eating the bag.  Having previously lived on the Monterey Peninsula, I am picky when it comes to seafood (especially shrimp), so I was pleased with Hot N Juicy.  The shrimp was quite delicious!    I don't think this will be a weekly or monthly restaurant of choice for me, but I'll enjoy taking my friends here who haven't ever tried it before.    I had a side of fries too, but I think next time, I want to try the rice.  I think the seasoning and juices mixed with white rice would be yummy!  NOTE: If you're not into the atmosphere of the restaurant, try carry-out!  It's definitely something you don't want to miss out on!"}
{"text":"Hot and Juicy Crawfish, particularly this location is my go to location for shellfish. They have excellent customer service. The staff are genuinely friendly. Our server Charmagne and Randy were very attentive and courteous. I will definitely be back for the amazing shrimp with hot n juicy sauce!"}
{"text":"The food was good, but we order three bags of shrimps and each bag tasted differently. The server for our table was TERRIBLE!!! She didn't give us a notice about not having corn till she just brings out the food and says \" oh by the way, we are out of corn, sorry, did you want to exchange that with something else?\"   The food was good, but we definitely did not enjoy that customer service."}
{"text":"This restaurant is sooooo good!!! Service was excellent! I got the crab legs mild hot and juicy style with corn and potatoes and a side of lemon pepper shrimp. It was so good. Our server was very nice and helpful"}
{"text":"Soooooo Darn good! I had a half pound of shrimp, half pound of mussels, cajun fries, and calamari with medium hot and juicy seasoning... It was pretty spicy but so good! Pretty expensive but you can't go wrong with anything on the menu."}
{"text":"OMG. Was our waitress Brittany so helpful and friendly. In from out of state and she just explained everything and answered all our questions. Will sure be back and hope we have her again."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place when walking down Mill Ave. Food was delicious.....and fun. Kids had a blast mutilating their dinner. Lol Service was excellent. He was very attentive and informative. Will definitely be coming here again."}
{"text":"Service in this place is terrible, but the food is decent. Honestly, if you have the choice go to angry crab over here, but I live a mile away so sometimes the convenience is worth it. I also wish they would bring everything out together instead of one at a time. Prices are ok though, however, I once tried to order the frozen crawfish and was told I couldn't until their fresh crawfish were gone."}
{"text":"Did somebody say CRAWFISH? omg, where?!?! I looooove crawfish. Heck, I absolutely love seafood, period! When my boyfriend and I were in Vegas, we decided to check out Hot N Juicy Crawfish. I know there's one in Fountain Valley but we wanted to check out the O.G. Hot N Juicy restaurant. Wasn't this place featured on one of the food network shows or something? Anyway, the servers were nice and informative. The reason why I say informative is because one of the servers thoroughly explained to us the concept of eating crawfish. When she was explaining, I was laughing in my head because shoot, I am a pro/master at eating this stuff! Not to brag but I worked at a crawfish restaurant before so yeaaa I think I am pretty familiar with this stuff haha! Nonetheless, it was still fun listening to her show us how to eat crawfish. Anyway, on to judging the food itself... The seasoning was very good! I thought it would be whatevers and nothing can compare to Boiling Crab's seasoning but the seasoning here comes close to Boiling Crab. If I'm ever in Vegas, I will stop by Hot N Juicy again. I wonder if the seasoning at the Hot N Juicy Crawfish in Fountain Valley taste similar to the one in Vegas..."}
{"text":"Seafood lover paradise....prepare to be messy but it's all good"}
{"text":"This place left a bad taste in my mouth, along with service. I'm a little spoiled being from Texas, and near New Orleans where you get real crawfish. This was a $50 lesson, which I am not upset about, I just will not be returning. My guess is I will be seeing something different there in 3 months. 2nd star is for convenience to where I live."}
{"text":"Note to self, if the waitress brings gloves and a bib for you to wear you should probably use them. Messiest most delicious meal ever!!! Great place."}
{"text":"So love seafood! And to get orders by the pound, this is the place to be! Now, to b formal? Oh no! This is the place to get down & dirty! Lol wouldn't recommend this place for a first date restaurant! Lol but for sure u will be satisfied! Although we called in our order for p/u, it's a good thing that we did because this place was packed!"}
{"text":"After goin to the WRONG location & had some communication trouble tryin to place our order, we FINALLY MADE IT! And of course bein that it's in Chinatown, parking sucks! Lol Well good thing our order was ready, now it's all about, gettin home to have it STILL Hot n Juicy lol"}
{"text":"I'm from socal, and this is better than boiling crab. The sauce is good, and the girls keep saying I'm hot and juicy I dunno why"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! I've been here many times and it's always a great experience. Love the food, love the ambience, love the service. Our server, Lexi, is great and full of awesomeness. Ask her for a \"Freeze Five\" the next time she is your server!"}
{"text":"This spot is Amazing. I love the entire experience and when we missed our flight, my sister and I had our friend take us back for more food. Everything is so delicious and well season with the perfect spice. I can't wait to go back again when I visit Vegas this yr."}
{"text":"Since the last post, Lainie B./Larnia B./Zen O./whatever her name is has closed her account. So much for that. I hope everyone has been able to go HOT & JUICY to experience the food and I hope the service was better served with you than with my group of friends.   I've been in the hospitality industry for over 5 years now, and regardless if it's the F&B industry or the hotel industry, the service you give to your customers is KEY to the success of the business. But here's what I don't get...why \"ruin\" the food but make it extremely SPICY to a point no one can eat the food just because you just want them to get out of your restaurant? If that's the case, why not tell the customer that the kitchen is closing and you have already seated the last table instead of telling them they have 2 minutes to order! As memory should have serve you RIGHT, the group of people you just TRIED to push away have been loyal customers of HOT & JUICY since DAY 1; so of course it'll take less than 2 minutes to order!   I am definitely still raving about this because I still cannot believe how rude people can be. Sadly, I miss the food. But I shall stand my ground until Lainie B. and Mario can apologize publicly for treating customers the way they did. As an employee of an establishment, regardless of your level of management in the restraunt, you DO NOT SWEAR at your customers!   I hope no one else gets the service my friends experienced."}
{"text":"Been here several times and am definitely a fan.  Hot & Juicy flavor is the way to go.   If you're afraid to suck the crawfish heads and eat all the juicy stuff inside, then shrimp is the way to go.  It's 2 dollars more per pound but you'll also get alot more food with less shell.  I love crawfish more but since I'm from the South I'm used to paying  3-4 bucks a pound.  To fulfill my desires I'll get 2 lbs shrimp, 1 lb crawfish with my friend.  We like to get extra corn and potatoe since it's so yummy.    They tend to understate the heat so a medium is probably hot, and hot is extra.....and so forth.  Great place - definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"I must go back soon!! The shrimp was tender, flavorful, just perfect. And next time I will NOT share their corn fritters!! Holy cow!! They knocked my socks off."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible service the young inexperienced broads working in here suck......Very rude nasty almost a hostile atmosphere.  Shame on you hot and juicy.  ......"}
{"text":"Such a great experience! Ordered a pound of shrimp with the garlic butter and a mild spice and two pounds of crawfish with the hot N juicy seasoning with it being spicy and WOW!!! So good! They all come with heads and legs but it was fun to deconstruct and get your hands dirty! The staff was amazing!! Everyone is so helpful! Felt like all the servers care about all the tables and not just their section! Well done! We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"First, a disclaimer: I moved here from Southern California and my parents still live in Orange County so I probably visit them and a crawfish joint there (Boiling Crab, Claws, etc...) at least every month.  Hot N Juicy has gotten better over the years with their service.  The waiters are very attentive now and you will never experience a crisis of tongue-on-fire and an-empty-drink-in-hand.  The service is consistent and commendable.  However, what they improved in service, they still lack in taste.  Let me digress for a second: the spine of any seafood-in-a-bag formula is the sauce, something that resulted from Vietnamese people living in New Orleans, loving crawfish, Cajun spice, butter, garlic, and more garlic.  The Viet crawfish craze started in Houston, jumped to Westminster, and spread nationwide.  Hot N Juicy is the Las Vegas response to a community that contains a sizable Vietnamese population.  They caught their lucky break from appearing on the Travel Channel.  But they cannot be the representative for the Vietnamese Cajun crawfish subculture.  Which brings me back to sauce: Hot N Juicy's most popular sauce for any seafood in a bag is far behind.  Besides being too watery, it also contains too much garlic (yes, it's possible).  There is having enough garlic to highlight the flavor of the seafood (something Boiling Crab & Claws in Orange County do well) and there is suffocating the flavor with too much garlic.  There is one thing I love here, which are the sweet potato fries, fried to perfection with the right crisp.  I'll go to Hot N Juicy if my Vegas friends crave it; but if it was up to me, I'd ask them to work on improving the sauce, like they have with the service."}
{"text":"This is one of the many places I have to stop by when I'm in Vegas. This time we were at #2 and they didn't have fresh crayfish, only frozen ones. I guess #1 was also out of fresh ones too. I thought frozen ones would taste rubbery because that's how they taste like when I buy frozen ones at the store. I got to sample some and they weren't bad so we decided to stay and order them. Pictures doesn't do justice so stop by when you're in Vegas. We stopped at the gelato place next door afterwards and they could smell the crayfish in our clothes lol"}
{"text":"This is my absolutely must go at least once place when I visit Las Vegas and I go to Las Vegas about once a year (it's not the slots, my relatives live there!) If youridea of dinner out is nice place settings, fine flatware and dinnerware this is NOT the place for you and if you think using your hands as a means to get the food to your mouth is barbaric then definitely DO NOT come here. The best deal is ordering seafood by the pound, choosing your sauce and degree of spiciness and wait for it to be plunked down on your table in plastic bags. I have to confess that crawfish is very popular here but I am not a fan of crawfish but maybe it's because I haven't mastered how to get the most out of it but watching people who love it, it must be very good. I love ordering shrimp with the classic hot n' juicy sauce at medium spiciness, leftover sauce is always taken home and I've even sauteed some shrimp and added it to the leftover sauce to have another feast at home and it tastes great. The soft shell crab is pretty good too and occasionally I've ordered the fresh oysters. The prices are reasonable, about US $13 for a pound of seafood. I've had clams, mussels, shrimp but shrimp to me has the best value as shells of the other stuff weigh a lot more. Bibs are provided as well as lots of paper towel and disposable gloves. Serving dishes are either plastic bags or paper lined plastic baskets or disposable bowls and plates. Tables are covered with plastic and that is your placemat as well and at the end of your meal they just tie up the corners of the tablecloth to bundle up the remnants of your meal and straight into the garbage bins."}
{"text":"Recommended by a neighbor we just had to give it a try...  What an incredible find...  Service - Tim was our server and he rocked. He was on the ball and his support team/other staff were awesome.  Drinks - Soda, Beer and wine...Sapporo $3, can't beat an ice cold Japanese beer.  Ambiance/Tableware - No knifes and forks, all you get is paper towels, a bib and unlimited wipes at the end of the meal. Decor is rustic, plenty of flat screens, great little bar area, just good clean (messy)  fun.  Don't let plastic bag serving vessels put you off and make as much mess as you want to!  Food - Pound of Lemon Pepper, mildly spiced and just friggin off the charts. Super succulent and delicious.  Pound of Hot n Juicy flavored, mildly spiced with corn and a few red potatoes. Great flavor, really really juicy and plump. Getting two pounds the next time!!! Corn and potatoes perfect.  Pound of mild, garlic butter King Crab...OMG to die for. Nothing really needs to be said just get them and lots of them!  Bill was $63 for soda, 3 beers and all that food (King Crab was most expensive at $24 per pound), you just won't find a better deal or a better way to spend some time getting covered, literally, in flavor and eating GREAT food.  Thanks Tim, we will be back!  PS. They have a location closer to the strip but according to Tim this location is the original, smaller and has a more homey felling to it. The owner is expanding the chain but not franchising. Nice to hear."}
{"text":"\"Just keep the spicy shrimp coming\"  2 bags of shrimp with a bowl of rice and a gLass of wine... This girL was in FooD COMA. Always worth the stop when visiting!"}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with Hot N Juicy! Stopped by the new location to take advance of the drinks but the service was less than perfect. It wasn't too busy but for some reason our service was rushed. The food was good as always no complaints there but the waiters didn't seem too interested in helping us with our problem that we had with our bill. There was an extra item on the bill and it wasn't a big deal we just couldn't seemed to get help for a while with removing it. Overall it was still good experience because of the meal we had, a drink or two wasn't a bad option either."}
{"text":"Alan H said it best...ditsy staff.  This was my 2nd go round with this place and it will not be a 3rd.  Received my bag of \"mild\" lemon pepper crab legs without the potatoes or corn that I ordered.  I informed the server the items were missing and asked her to verify that I received mild sauce because it was pretty spicy and requested some butter. She finally returned with the potatoes and corn 15 minutes later when I literally had 3 legs left and still no butter.  I told her I was almost finished and she asked if I still wanted the butter and I said yes.  20 minutes later I asked her if she forgot the butter and she said they were backed up in the kitchen and she wasn't allowed in there.  SERIOUSLY!!!  Now the icing on the NOT so sweet cake for the night is when I walked out and forgot my phone.  I immediately returned within 5 minutes and amazingly no one knew where the phone was.  When dialing the phone from the restaurant's phone my Fitbit was in Bluetooth distance and picked up the call.  So they insisted it was in the trash.  One of the male employees took the bag of trash and spread it on the entire patio and still no phone.  Went back in and dialed the number again and now it's not registering on my Fitbit.  Hmmm, then amazingly someone comes out of the kitchen with the phone saying \"we found it in the trash back here\". She was wiping the phone with a paper towel and I noticed there was nothing on the paper towel or the phone.  Interesting how the phone ended up in the trash all the way back there so quickly."}
{"text":"Service was great. Their seafood is so fresh and SPICY. I'm usually pretty good with spiciness. But their medium spicy was so strong that my lips were swollen and hurt. I recommend trying Baby spicy first before anything further. And overall sauce was very salty. Except the seasoning part, everthying was on point. We only paid $80 for a lobster, big big shrimps, mussels, two corns and two rice including tips. I'm very satisfied with my first visit."}
{"text":"Best service!!!!! Leila, Kayla, rich!!!! Had an amazing night. Everybody should go to Henderson location! Very happy"}
{"text":"All I have to say is omg this is a great place to come eat Cajun fries are the best and all food comes by the pound when I saw it on Man Vs food I knew it looked good but it tastes better than what it looks super fast to bring out the food and the service is the best..... if ur in Vegas it's a must!!!"}
{"text":"When I think of Hot n Juicy, my first thought is not crawfish. Probably more along the lines of Megan Fox, Denise Richards, or Megan Good. Crawfish has always been a tough food for me to try. It looks like a ghetto version of a lobster crossed with shrimp and for the longest time I have given it the nickname of \"Little Cockroach\". I always felt why would you eat a crawfish on purpose? It's like choosing ground beef when you can have steak. Shrimp has always been my favorite weapon of choose for any of these cajun \"Boiling Crab\" type places, because of the efficient flavor to value ratio. A Crawfish is usually about 9 to 10 bucks a pound and is about 60% shell and 40% meat (I will later find out 90% shell or greater and less than 10% meat). Trust me for a pound of crawfish. You will pay a handsome penny and will not have enough meat to make a crab salad or even an appetizer with crackers.   How did you find out about Hot N Juicy Crawfish? How does it taste though?? How's the quality? Stop being negative! You might say.  I am guilty of watching Man Vs Food like the majority of all the yelp reviews for this restaurant. Normally, MVF's track record has been fairly poor, but this is different! Who doesn't like Asian flavors crossed with Cajun style? That's like saying you don't like Amerie (so hot!) or Hines Ward (not as hot). I ordered 1 lb Shrimp and 1lb of Crawfish to give Crawfish a try and have my shrimp as a back up, both Hot n Juicy style.   The shrimp was great of course, although it was slightly under cooked. I think that's because maybe no one ever orders shrimp. It was a nice big size almost Jumbo shrimp sized and it tasted pretty good with the Hot N Juicy sauce, but nothing to jump out of your seat over. Shrimp is a dollar more than crawfish, but its worth it, because it is 95% meat and 5% shell. Time for my first taste of crawfish! At first, I honestly did not know how to eat it. I tried using my shrimp peeling skills, but I looked like a squirrel trying to get a nut. I finally swallowed my pride and asked one of the pretty waitress to help show me how to suck head. Get your mind out the gutter!!! Ha ha.. but that's how you are suppose to eat crawfish. You first suck the head, that's what she said (that's what she said) then you eat the meat. Hmmm.. Good thing this review is PG. The flavor of the juicy coming from the crawfish was a lot better than the shrimp! The taste is very delicious. It's like sipping a hot bowl of pho and some zesty tomato based Italian dish. Maybe that's a bad analogy. Let's say the restaurant smelled and tasted like a cross between a Vietnamese/Chinese restaurant and a Cajun grill.   If you look around the restaurant you will see nothing, but people with smiles on their faces. This is unusually, because most restaurants I go to most people look impatient or serious. This is definitely a plus! My rating might be a tad bit harsh, but I feel it is truly honest. I do recommend that you give Hot N Juicy a try, only if you get there early and don't mind driving in to \"Chinatown\" (didn't see many Chinese places mostly Vietnamese restaurants, but all Asians look a like right? Don't answer that). If you are from Orange County and are spoiled by the Boiling Crab and other restaurants like it, be warned you may not like this place. There is less spicy and a little less flavor. If you are a Asian Cajun newbie, this will be a great start for you. I will go back again with my friends that have watched Man Vs Food, but I'm not a fan of great head with no meat, no pun intended."}
{"text":"This place is a good as it gets! It's messy, it's fun, it's dewiiiicious! I always get rice just because rice helps me get full, or else I could eat 10 lbs of seafood to myself with no problem, and w/o hesitation, I get calamari for babe and Clams forsure for me.   Firstly, you get started with a bibs, gloves, salt, pepper, and lemons. Squeeze the lemon in you salt and pepper for dipping your seafood. Put the gloves to the side, because not getting messy is no fun. Put your bib on (SERIOUSLY, PUT YOUR BIB ON IF YOU LIKE YOUR SHIRT), and prepare to devour.  The clams are juicy, plump, and large. The mussels are well-cleaned. The shrimp are large and generally not overcooked. You get to pick the size of D. Crab. Go big or go home! Corn is a 1/4 cob, sausage is sliced... overall you cant go wrong with what you get because it's the sauce that makes everything great!"}
{"text":"Delishness! We orders everything hot n juicy favor medium, Cajun calamari, & 3 sides of rice. 2 lbs of Manila clams, lb of mussels, lb of shrimp, and king crab legs. Everything tasted amazing! Their sauce was just the right amount of Cajun, garlic, sweetness, and spice. And it compliments soooo well with rice!   Cajun calamari was fresh and perfectly crisp and a hint of Cajun. I sprinkle lemon on top and always ask for a side of tartar. That's how I like it!   Gloves, bibs, lemons, salt & pepper, & great service from Jared were also included. This was my father's first time here & he wished there were a Hot n Juicy where he's from. If he wasn't traveling back home today, he would've packed the sauce. Most def be back!"}
{"text":"I loved the environment! The wait was a bit long but the service was amazing. The servers were super lazy though, there was one woman doing everything!"}
{"text":"Half good, half bizarre. Vague menu, had to ask a lot of questions just to order. No plates. Kind of messy and the napkins were a roll of paper towels.   Shrimp was good, but it had heads on it. Have only seen that a a Philippines restaurant and they apologized and took it back and cut the heads off.  Felt more like a fish boil picnic than dinner in a restaurant."}
{"text":"Not going to lie I used to like Hot n Juicy, but as of these past few months I've been seriously disappointed. I've noticed that if I go in there with 1 person, we sort of get good service (and by that I mean we get checked on about 2 times), but otherwise if I go in there by myself, forget it. There is no service. Which is sad because I do tend to order a lot with proper service but when you're getting ignored even when you're sitting there twiddling your thumbs blatantly looking around for a waitress, it's frustrating. The crawfish are cleaned incorrectly (black and cracked, that's not right) my 2 lb bag had more claws than actual crawfish...that was seriously disappointing. I won't be going back, I tried to give it more than a few chances but every time I go, I'm quickly reminded why I didn't like it last time."}
{"text":"Food and service was great the kitchen could use help though. They forgot 3 items however the flavors were great if you love spicy and garlic this is the place to be!!!"}
{"text":"Being a HUGE fan of Boiling Crab, it was only natural that I had to try this place out. We ordered 2 lbs of the shrimp with corn, mild spices (I'm a big pansy when it comes to spicy foods) with the garlic butter seasoning and it was DELICIOUS. 2 lbs between three was just the right amount and the mild was the right amount of spice for me. Maybe next time, I'll be more ballsy and try the medium. Thankfully, we got there relatively early, around 5 pm, so we only had to wait a few minutes. It was a great experience and it definitely does not hurt that the beer was cheap too!"}
{"text":"The hot and juicy sauce is amazing! This place is super messy but super good! It wouldn't be a good first date but definitely a good second date"}
{"text":"A friend and I came here about three weeks ago during the dinner rush and our server, Taylor (who was really great!) informed us that there were only 3 of the shell crackers and the little tools that pull the meat of the shell left in the restaurant, and she supplied us with plastic knives instead.. it was a bit uncomfortable and difficult but we just assumed that they were in the process of ordering some more. Then, yesterday we returned here for lunch and we were one of two tables in the entire restaurant, and when our food was delivered, the same great server Taylor, informed us that there was only one shell cracker in the whole restaurant and that the table next to us had it but we could have it as soon as they were finished. We sat and waited as long as we could but we paid $20 for our crab legs and we wanted to eat them when they were still hot. Unfortunately, the table next to us took forever and we never got to use the shell cracker so we basically paid $20 for only a few bites of crab since we couldn't get the meat out.  It's extremely unprofessional that a seafood place doesn't have the right tools to eat their food and it put us in a frustrating position yet again.  I'm not sure how more shell crackers have not been ordered yet but it's unfair to put the servers in the awkward position of telling people that they don't have them, and it's definitely unfair to the customers who are paying for food that they cannot even eat all of. We love coming here but it's hard to enjoy the food under those annoying circumstances."}
{"text":"Yummmmm crawfish! I've been to Boiling Crab a lot & I had high expectations for Hot N Juicy. Mos def lived up to the hype.  Came here about 40 minutes before closing on a Thursday with the boyfriend. We were seated right away =) This place is only about 7 minutes away from the strip.   The menu looks just like BC. However, the pricing is mostly Market Price, so no set price like BC. I did notice that they don't offer lobster, clams, and crab (i think).  We ordered 1 lb of shrimp &  2 lb of crawfish w/ half a dozen sausage & corn in their house special sauce in mild. We also ordered cajun fries.  Everything was delicious!! The sauce tasted similar to BC, but not as salty and buttery. Mild was a bit too spicy for me though, boyfriend said it wasn't spicy for him. The crawfish is about 2 times bigger than BC!! Yummmy!! More meat =) You can tell the crawfish is fresh too =) shrimp tasted like BC, but boyfriend said he didn't enjoy it as much.  Everything came out to about $50.  I was satisfied, I would come back for the crawfish."}
{"text":"I love hot and juicy craw fish! Every time I go to Vegas, I'd like to stop by and eat here. Although last night, the craw fish didn't taste good since it was \"California\" craw fish instead of Louisiana craw fish. It had a fishy smell and the shell was harder than usual. The head had this white stringy thing that lead to the back so it was gross to see and eat it. Other than that, the sauce is really good! I would definitely come back but I would order the Lousiana craw fish this time. Overall, I had a pleasant experience once again."}
{"text":"Came here for crawfish for the first time, experience here was great. The wait staff here was amazing. My girlfriend and I ordered the set menu called the drool. When the seafood came out I noticed the crawfish wasn't there, the waitress was surprised too. Overall experience was excellent!"}
{"text":"Amazing, authentic, aromatic, and appetizing. If you don't mind tearing apart your crawfish to get to the delicious parts, you have to go here.  They have the right fixin's, and they definitely have the right flavor. A little pricey, but worth every penny."}
{"text":"After Adam Richmond of Man Vs. Food went here, we had to go give it a try.  We had the shrimp, crawfish, corn, and wings.  Overall, pretty good, but the wings aren't really worth it.  It's one of the few things made of meat you can get though.  The quality of the food is great and I only took out one star because the shrimp was not cleaned; meaning it came with that dirty little black vein in it."}
{"text":"Great food, reasonable prices, good service.  Crawfish and shrimp by the pound.  Three sauces (as I recall) with three heat levels for each.  I had the signature \"Hot & Juicy\" sauce, but got mild because I was not alone.  On my own I'd probably get medium.  Great flavor.  Be ready to get messy.  They provide paper towels and bibs...you'll need them.  This is on my list anytime I return to Vegas."}
{"text":"This place really Hits the spot when I am craving well season spicy shrimp with a side of corn. My whole family loves this place. I agree sometimes service is not all that great but it's a hit and miss just like in any other restaurant."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place since I first saw it on Man vs Food and I missed coming here for my bday last month.  So my goal was to try to eat here for new years eve as 1 of my last meals for 2009.  Since I'm a big fan of crawfish, that's what we ordered along with the shrimp.  So 4 lbs of food between 2 people along with rice for my friend.  Since I am from Cali, we do have to compare every place to Boiling Crab.  So far, BC is the top.  This place would come in 2nd place.  The prices are pretty reasonable for the seafood since they are market price.  I wish they did post the prices up somewhere but they don't so you do have to ask how much it is per lb for the seafood items.  You do have to order the Hot N Juicy flavoring.  We didn't do the extra spicy and spicy was good enough for us since it did make our nose watery.  As for the size of the crawfish, they were sooo small.  I thought they might be a little bit bigger, but nope.  Small that I even had to take a picture of it since I think I was in shock from the size of it.  ;p  None the less, it was still yummy and I would definitely go back if I was craving crawfish in lv.  Note to remember, you do have to ask for the bibs and salt, pepper, lime sauce since they don't bring it to you initially like BC.  Service was pretty good except there was 1 waitress that seemed a little bit rude when she was talking to the guests so not sure if she was having an off day or if that's just her personality."}
{"text":"Got the baby spice Shrimp & snow crab legs. I can't tolerate very spicy food & the baby spice was killer for me. The waiter asked what I was drinking & never brought my drink. I asked for sweet rolls & I waited 15 mins, they arrived at the end of my meal. I told her I no longer wanted them. The service sucked but the food was good. On the fence if I'll be back"}
{"text":"Great food!!! One thing I hate about this place is that it's bitch to find parking spot when it's busy and parking lot is too small we had many times just turn around n left because we couldn't park the car :("}
{"text":"My anniversary is coming up in April and I can't wait to visit Hot and Juicy Crawfish again!"}
{"text":"My first time at hot n juicy and it was amazing. I am from Houston and pretty picky when it comes to seafood, but Ashley made it easy for us! She recommended the hot n juicy sauce and it was a hit for the table! Get that on everything!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place!!!!  We got the crawfish, shrimp, sausage, corn and potatoes in the Hot and Juicy seasoning/ medium heat.  YUM!  We did smell like garlic for the next couple days, but it was totally worth it.  As some one else said, the corn did seem a little over cooked, but it wasn't bad enough to stop me from going and getting it again. I know people say there are better places in CA, but I don't happen to live in CA, so will probably not get a chance to try other places anytime soon. I love being able to support a local restaurant that is privately owned- well done Hot N Juicy Crawfish!"}
{"text":"Slow!Slow!Slow!! Did I mention slow? This has to be one of the slowest locations I have ever been to! Here's the thing I really try not to ding businesses on little things but when it's too many little things that can add up to big things I have to give the proper amount of stars. I came here last week with Two of my girlfriends for a lunch date. We were seated promptly which was a plus but then it seems that everything went down hill after that. For starters, they weren't even that busy and the fact that it too almost 10 mins just to get our drinks was already the first red flag! Once we received our drinks another waiter comes to bring us more drinks? I'm guessing there was a miscommunication because he brought the wrong drinks.. Hmm so once it came to ordering the food we ordered collectively the shrimp..crab legs and a catfish basket. All of the orders came out at different times and about 10 mins apart with the catfish taking the longest. They brought the fries out first then one by one our food? Wtf? Idk but the only thing that was good was the food the service was beyond ridiculous. We never got asked for refills after eating this hot food you would think you would check in ever so often? That wasn't the case. Even the check took another 10-15 minutes after asking to pay we almost felt like our meal was free! Ha! No thanks I prefer the boiling crab! Won't be returning"}
{"text":"I love the fact that you can go crazy and make a mess. They provide bibs and gloves for the messy eaters. I didn't need them since I'm pro when it comes to eating shellfish or like to think. LoL.  I miss going to the crawfish festival in Cali. The staff is outstanding and friendly. I wish I got the bigger bag with the crab legs. It was so good I wanted more but I could literally eat all day."}
{"text":"What a way to start a vacation, great tasting crawfish!  The crawfish was well seasoned and their spicy, hot n juicy special wasn't very spicy but it's fine, it was actually my preferred level of hotness.  Their cajun fries were good \"enough\", just some cajun spices sprinkled on regular french fries.  Their oysters were a good start also, but their chicken nuggets (we had a child with us) sucked.  At 10.99/lb at the time of this writing, ah who cares, you're in Vegas, spend a little!"}
{"text":"Not too bad of a wait if you get there on the later side. Delicious and MESSY. Be prepared to smell like your food for the rest of the night (Especially if your bearded like myself)."}
{"text":"One star for spice flavor. Service was overwhelmed and they weren't even that busy. Maybe it was the season that I went, but the crawfish was very small, corn and potatoes were not fresh."}
{"text":"One of my girl friends convinced me to go here and I was sold once I found out that it was the same place I saw on Man V. Food.  This place is in such an unsuspecting area and the parking lot a  little tiny.  But once you open the door the sweet smell of butter and garlic fill the room.  There was a little wait which I was surprised about bc places like this in LA have an hour wait minimum!!   The food was good!! My bf and I got the Hot N Juicy Special, Spicy on shrimp.  I'd get the crawfish but I was too tired to put in the effort for such a small amount of meat.  We also ordered the deep fried soft shell crabs with corn & cajun fries.  LOVE LOVE LOVED the soft shell crabs!! They were soo tasty and so crabby!  I just wish they had more in that basket!  I believe it only came with like 8 or something like that but I could have definitely went for another basket if I wasn't concerned with spending too much $$$ there.  The shrimp was awesome but almost TOO spicy!! I love heart in my food but this made my lips burn so I prob could have went medium on them.  But the shrimp were decently sized and cooked perfectly.  I hate when shrimp are overcooked but HNJ did not disappoint in that aspect.  Great place to go if you are craving some seafood southern style!  Be prepared to get down a dirty because eating with your hands is a MUST!!! Get those napkins ready..you'll be needing them =]"}
{"text":"My very first time I went was with the same person I always eat out with if it isn't my boyfriend, so I might as well introduce you to my friend Mikhail.. not a yelper, yet! haha.. Anyway, it was both our first time & I have never tried crawfish before.  We ended up getting sharing the two bags [2lbs each?] of juicy cajun crawfish, the soft shell crab basket w cajun fries, and calamari. I felt like such a newbie trying to open the crawfish, I splashed myself a couple times, but that's what the bibs are for, right? The flavoring was great; we ordered medium & it was just enough for me. My nose was running a little & my eyes got watery, but I enjoyed it. I think next time I'll stick with crab legs cause I definitely have that down to a science ;) The cajun fries were straaight up cajun! I'd have to stop myself after a while because it would get a little spicy. Soft shell crab was good, just wanted marinara sauce from the calamari instead of the tartar that the soft shell came with :) The calamari was house made, but it wasn't anything fancy for me. There's only a few places where I can say that's GREAT calamari.   The service was average, it was a Sunday & the Lakers were playing Orlando so we had to wait for a good 20 minutes for a table for two. I didn't realize that the restrooms were in two different spots, but our table was against the wall for the mens restroom & I was washing my hands before & after we ate. My bad fellerz!  The weird thing is that at the bottom of the receipt says you get a 3% discount if you pay cash.. I don't get it, do you have to present the check with the cash, then get a new receipt with the new balance? They already use enough disposable stuff & use styrofoam cups so I don't really think they're going green anyway. Blah, maybe I'm going crazy because I'm yelping & it's already 6am!! Random.. and awkward receipt though. I will be back Hot N Juicy! The simplicity of the menu & your system is definitely working, so much props. I'll probably come back on a weekday because that day was madness~"}
{"text":"The place had really good seafood in general, I ordered crab legs, crawfish, shrimp, green mussels, and the sweet potato fries. The shrimp was good but was too watery, I felt like the taste was wasted in the water instead of it being in the shrimp. Crab legs and green mussels were amazing! By the way, I ordered everything spicy Cajun and didn't even feel any tingles. Lastly, the sweet potato pulled everything together taste wise. The only icky annoyance was that the place was stuffy and too small; when I got out it smelled like shit to be honest . It was a pretty good dining experience overall but I don't think that I want to come back. If you don't care about the feeling of dining with the next table and smelling dog shit when you get out then you would love the place !"}
{"text":"So hot, so juicy, so good. So this is what everyone's been raving about. \"I mean, how good can buttered-up crustaceans really be for people to wait in line for long periods of time?\" I wondered to myself as I waited in line, albeit I expected a wait for a party of 14 or so. For people who like to get their hands dirty and have an affinity for head on crustaceans, Hot N Juicy is 5 stars for sure.   For me, however, I don't like to get my hands dirty (especially under my fingernails), and I prefer my crustacean to be deveined and decapitated before I devour them. Nevertheless, I must say I enjoyed Hot N Juicy. I ordered a pound of shrimp in the signature Hot N Juicy special sauce, medium-level spicy. If you order two pounds or more, you get corn and potatoes thrown in the bag. I wish they would include corn and potatoes with one pound orders though...  With plastic gloves on and paper towels laid out in front of me, I opened the bag of shrimp and spicy steam, and grabbed a shrimp. The worst part about this experience (other than the mess) is cleaning the shrimp before eating. It takes a long time. But I guess it's good to eat slow. The best part about this Hot N Juicy experience is the sauce. The sauce is so tasty- savory, buttery, spicy, garlicky, etc. Make sure to generously dip the meat in the sauce. The sauce is 5 stars, but the shrimp are probably worthy of 3. While some of the shrimp were plump and firm (a sign of freshness), some others were kind of mushy (a sign of age). I detest mushy shrimp!  What would make Hot N Juicy perfect is if they offered complimentary bread to sop up the delicious sauce that comes with your seafood order. That would be cajun heaven right there!"}
{"text":"I don't know of another place better in town to get this.  I've had some stomach issues one time, took the leftovers home, and didn't connect the two. Ate the leftovers the next night, and had stomach problems again. This only happened from this one visit of many.  Other than that, the food is yummy delicious. Solid 4 stars."}
{"text":"On a Thursday around 8pm was super chill. Enjoyed corn upgrade with a pound of shrimp hot n juicy flavoured with a side of rice. I was treated out from a friend and I'm grateful for him. Server was more than nice and hooked it up with extra lemons. Around $80 for three people"}
{"text":"Damn good.  Fist time here.  It's very similar to a place I go to in Fort Worth, TX.  Sit outside if it's nice and cool out"}
{"text":"I have finally found a little piece of  heaven on earth (thanks for recommendation Teri C.!!)!! Hot N Juicy has definitely satisfied my craving for the crawfish/shrimp in a bag that I am so used to getting in my family's home state of Louisiana. Upon entering the restaurant we were received a warm welcome and sat down very quickly. The two flat screen plasmas across the way had ESPN news and the Dodger game on so I was very happy about that!! Our server guided us the the small menu and gave us a flavor profile of each seasoning that they had for their seafood fare. My friend and I had 2 lbs of crawfish and 2lbs of shrimp with a half order of sausage. When our order came to the table, we opened up our plastic bags with excitement!! At that moment both of us were placed in a euphoric state by the smell!! The Hot n Juicy special seasoning (spicy or extra spicy will make you want to slap somebody it is so good) is what I recommend for your seafood....a whole lot of spice and garlic which I love!! We put our bibs on and went to town!! The crawfish/shrimp/sausage were fresh, and the corn/potato was just as flavorful as the seafood. The service was great....we had someone at our table for what ever we needed at all times. I would give this place another half star for having Heineken Light available which I can't seem to find in many places except for my fridge!! A very enjoyable experience at the Hot N Juicy!! I will be back soon.........probably tomorrow!!"}
{"text":"Hot n Juicy is a great place to dine at.  The service is good, the price is good.  The food is very good.  This place seems to be more reasonably priced compared to the boiling crab.  It is also a good place for kids!"}
{"text":"We went here for the second time this last Friday night, the place was packed, despite this the wait staff treated us wonderfully!  The food was great, crab mussels shrimp and crawfish were all great.    Both of our visits to this place were fantastic."}
{"text":"Best tasting shrimp I've ever tasted! The beer was smooth and the oysters fresh! Our server Valentina had the greatest attitude! She was very kind and professional. Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I like the fact that you can be grossed out by veins in your seafood and still enjoy this place!  I happen to be a person that loves my seafood fully processed by the time it hits my plate and palette! I also love the addicting flavors they cook up here for their seafood bags! So what's a girl to do ?? Order sauces to go!!! Yessss! I come in order my sauces and go home to enjoy my fully processed food! Lol, truly it's a great accommodation for picky eaters and even if your cooking for a crowd at home! So basing the review on that alone ... 4 stars for unbeatable flavor, ease and speed of service (Togo service), as well as affordability!"}
{"text":"I finally popped my Hot & Juicy cherry! First time here and it was all that everyone said it was, and more!   Their idea of spicy is REALLY spicy, I think we had ordered mild and my friends were still dying. I was fine but there was definitely a kick to it!   I didn't take any pictures since we were pretty much just thrown into the fray of it all and it's quite messy!   I recommend the crab legs for sure, and well, the crawfish, however since it was November when we went, crawfish was not in season, so they warn you that the crawfish was previously frozen and not fresh. Thanks for the warning! We will ordered them anyway. Fries were good, softshell crab platter was good, shrimp I think was the best of them all, next to the crab legs.   A little hard getting server's attention, but other than that, it was a fun time and delicious meal."}
{"text":"Had the shrimp and mussels with the corn fritters. All delish! Off the strip but way worth it!"}
{"text":"Very very delicious!! Nice servers, nice little place. Food came out fast and hot. I have no complaints parking is very tiny so be warned"}
{"text":"It's all about the Hot and Juicy special sauce! spicy please!       I came here a few weeks ago on a visit to Vegas and had to hit up Hot N Juicy Crawfish for shrimp, crawfish, and snow crab.  I was only in Vegas for two days and I went there twice!  I like the different variations of seafood they have at this place.          It was a little crowded when I got there, but only 30 mins or so.  After getting seated I already knew what I wanted, so I ordered the hot juicy special snowcrab, crawfish, and shrimp.  I put my bib on and waited for my order with my ice cold heineken.  Once the food got there I went to town with it.           I love the idea of using my hands to man handle the food.  Good stuff, definitely worth the trip if your ever in Las Vegas...forget the buffets.  Hot N Juicy crawfish is where you wanna be."}
{"text":"Awesome, Awesome, Awesome. This was the finisher of our Vegas trip on our way back to Los Angeles. Our friend suggested this place since we enjoyed the boiling crab in K-Town. It was not a disappointment. The wait was not bad, it was about 20 minutes. Once we were seated we placed out order for four pounds of shrimp and 2 pounds of craw-fish. We stuck to the mild and medium. Great kick.. The craw-fish and shrimp were huge, both in flavor and size.   Everything about this place was great. The servers busted their buts to make sure that our table was clean and that we were served. They took good care of us.   If you live in Las Vegas, or passing through after a few slots, this is the place to go. Your hands are the forks and knife and the table is your plate. Dive in and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Food here is great. Always a good experience and the staff is very welcoming too. Great place for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I love this place. Be warned. Wear comfy clothes. And make sure you don't mind having those clothes smell because once you walk out, people from miles away will be able to smell your new perfume \"eu de shrimp\".  The wait wasn't too bad. The only reason it took a bit longer was because we had a huge party... and that's understandable.   My order: 1lb of shrimp (hot/juicy special, mild), calamari, and sweet potato fries. The shrimp was extraordinary, while the calamari and sweet potato fries were nothing out of the ordinary. I love the yummy  butter garlicky lemon buttery spicy sauce that they boil those bad boys in. A tip: after taking off the shell, pinch the shrimp meat so that it flattens out a bit and then take it on a dunk in the sauce. Believe me, it helps to sop up that sauce!   The fries needed a bit more salt but it was good and crunchy! The calamari was great. Needed a bit more uniqueness to it but all in all, it was tasty.  Would I go here again? Hell yesssss!!! Bring on the bib baby!"}
{"text":"The best cajun in Las Vegas!!! So delicious! Great service! Good prices! Thanks once again for outstanding service on my weekly trips"}
{"text":"What a bad end to a good night.  The food was great, the servers were friendly, but when it came time to pay our bill, the manager refused to let our server split our bill into individual checks.  I have never seen a restaurant that refused to let a group split their bill.  Negotiating with the manager on the issue was like talking to a brick wall. There was no reasoning with her, just an explanation of a blanket policy that only so many cards were allowed per table.  It made me think they had some issue with paying credit card fees, and when we offered to pay the transaction percentage, the same blanket refusal to split the checks came back up.  After other members of our group tried to reason with her, she agreed to split the checks, but took so dramatically long to process each card that out of frustration one person in our group gave up and agreed to pay the whole amount.  That wasn't fair to him, and it was a bad way to do business.  I am going to write this off to an inexperienced manager who was trying to stand her ground behind a bad company policy she didn't fully understand, but regardless, it made for an unnecessary and unpleasant situation.  If you eat at this place, make sure everyone sits at their own table or be prepared to foot the bill."}
{"text":"We came to eat here and the place was packed the food was awesome and our server Biel was super efficient and helpful the boys didn't know how to eat crawfish and she showed them how to eat them we all had a great time and food was super delicious"}
{"text":"I would give this place 6 stars if there's an option. It's right off the strip you'll need to take the cab there. It's never busy in the day time ( not sure about at night). My 1st time eating crawfish was at this place few years ago but never gotten a chance to write a review about it. Ate  there like 2 times while was in vegas.  I still hear good reviews from family members and friends who just got back from there recently this year. This place is the reason I became obsessed with those little critters. There were pics of celebrities on the wall who also ate here. NICE!  The environment is decent looking and the service was good and acceptable. There's always plenty of paper towels around and bathrooms are clean. Anyone who hasn't tried it should give it a try. It's worth every penny. Come on now... it has to be that good to make it on the food channel and travel channel. I think man vs food made the right choice. Boiling crab just isn't buttery and hot enough for a  challenge.   Below is a little  review comparison between Hot n Juicy special sauce vs boiling crab whole sha-bang sauce. I've been to boiling crab about 8 times now in SJ and 1 time in anaheim and it is so far  the best in CA. I usually order 6 lbs.  I read some reviews here from others who had tried Hot N Juicy crawfish and I have to completely disagree with them calling this place a duplicate or copy cat of boiling crab. They should go get their taste buds checked. Hot N Juicy is 5x buttery/stickier and a bit sweeter but they do have xtra spicy as an option. Their sauce will leave your fingers smelling for days that's how good it is.  Boiling crab on the other hand has that smokey taste and their spice is acceptable. I normally order xtra spice.  What happens in vegas stays in vegas except for the smell it follows you home. Hot n juicy crawfish still remains #1 as my favorite place. 5+ stars from me for their awesome delicious foods.Boiling crab is right behind it unless Red Crawfish in SF can knock it to 3rd place. Red crawfish will be my next stop."}
{"text":"Did not expect to like this place.  No plates or silverware, everything covered in plastic, bib on the table, offered plastic gloves to wear to eat dinner.  The whole concept just seemed off putting.    I was wrong.  It was great!  I enjoyed every messy bit.   We had clams, crab, shrimp, potatoes and corn all served to our table in plastic bags fresh out of the boil.    The service was excellent as they made us feel like we were their only customers.    The only downside is that parking on Mill is a challenge so we parked in one of the pay garages and it cost $8."}
{"text":"This is a fun restaurant to get cooked king crab legs and shrimp.  Funny enough I had the opposite problem of reviewer Sns T N, I specifically asked for a corn on the cob and a potato to be placed in each bag.  Guess what was missing from the king crab bag?  A potato.  Also, I'm not a big fan of spice, and so I asked for both bags to be mild.  The shrimp bag wasn't a problem, but once again the king crab legs bag was too spicy :(. I took my order home as this was a take out order.  I didn't discover the potato difficiency until I got home.  Also, I was a little disappointed that they didn't include some wet naps and some bibs in my to go bag.  And so, in conclusion, if you order take out from the Glendale AZ store, 1) check the contents of the bag before leaving and 2) ask for some wet naps and bibs."}
{"text":"We (husband, me & 5 year old) thoroughly enjoyed our meal. We ordered King crab legs, shrimp, potatoes, sausage and corn. Spice-flavor level was baby spice  juicy Cajun. The shrimp was delicious. The crab was a bit salty. The add-ons were tasty.   We arrived around 6:45 pm on a Friday and were quickly seated at a table. The wait would have been longer if we had requested a booth.  The service was just ok. We had to ask for a cup lid for my son's lemonade and when it didn't come after our waitress walked by our table twice my husband had to walk to the counter to get one. We also had to ask for cutlery and a bin to discard the shrimp and crab shells.  The meal all together is messy. You are given bibs and a roll of papertowel is already are the table. The food is delivered in clear plastic bags. There are no plates so you're eating off the table.   Every one enjoyed the experience and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food was beyond amazing but the service left a little to be desired. One server was advising the booth behind our party that \"white people cant handle the spicy flavors.\" Kind of rude in my opinion. Didn't get any refills on my drink, but our server admitted he was new. Overall, still a good experience."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite spots! Every time I have family visiting from Hawai'i I always take them here. Never disappoints!"}
{"text":"SPICY CAJUN GARLIC BLAST  Had dinner here tonight it was amazing as ALWAYS. It was very empty but it may have been due to the fact that we were there at 4pm.  We ordered a lb. Of shrimp ...2.3 lbs. Of dungeness crab x2 .... lb. Of crawfish... & an order of corn fritters... Cajun fries.. & a bowl of rice. The server did look at us a little weird when we kept ordering because there were only two of us ordering this much food but we were troopers & finished it.   Everything was delicious and our server was super awsome and on point and he always kept checking up on us to make sure everything is good. Our crab came out a little undercooked & we asked them to cook it up a little more but they made us a whole new one! Talk about service!  Definately an amazing place to eat especially if u are looking for flavor!"}
{"text":"HOT N JUICY SPICYYYY! . ** 2017 Yelp 100 Challenge #16 ** . I haven't been to this location in a very long time. My last couple of experiences were horrible in service as the servers preferred to be goofing around with their coworkers rather than making sure their guests actually had drinks while eating fiery finger licking goodness. The last time i had good service here was probably when Cam was supervising there but i believe she left to open the California locations. . I don't like to write bad reviews because... well... maybe there was a situation, but luckily i didn't have the need to write a bad one since finally w/ this visit it was a breath of FRESH air. I believe our server's name was Brandon or Randy.... pretty sure its Randy.... its just so loud in there since they are busy. This guy was our FRESH air... NEW... EAGER... HUSTLING!! We like our servers to be hustlers because they make money & we get what we need in a timely manner without having to ask. He was fast & one key MAJOR IMPORTANT thing for this style of restaurant.... DRINKS.... He kept my husband's BEER$$ FULL at ALL times especially since husband wasn't eating since he is on this no dairy thing but nice enough to keep me company. My soda was also full at all times.   . I asked.... since i am in the service industry too... how do you know when my drink is low? his response... \"you got the spiciest level sauce... your drink is always gonna be low\" HAHAHAHA such a simplistic answer. Good job on finding this GUY Hot n Juicy . We always order the Hot N Juicy Spicy:  SHRIMP which is always cooked to perfection where we can easily peel off the shell  DUNGENESS CRAB which i LOVE because me being korean.... i LOVE to eat the brain part with rice & some of that HOT N JUICY sauce  CORN FRITTERS are perfect when you need a little sweet creaminess to cool down your mouth. SNOW CRAB has a saltier meat which i love SALTY anything no matter how much everyone tells me its bad for you.  sweet potato & cajun fries just to get me full & extra Hot N Juicy Spicy Sauce because i love to take it home to eat with rice for a week.  When i say WE... i mean JUST ME.... eating.... =/ dont judge. . Overall I'm super glad i can come back to this location instead of having to drive all the way to the EASTERN location which the staff there are AWSOME as well."}
{"text":"Love the crawfish! Alexis was on point with the spicy level description, service and amazing personality! We're going to back for the food and Alexis' service."}
{"text":"I will have to agree with the negative comments. Not only was the service extremely slow, the food was not worth the wait. We had a table of eight and our meals came out one basket at a time with 3-5 minutes between each service. My appetizer was calamari and it was not seasoned and it was served after my entire party had been served their meals. Not planning to dine there again."}
{"text":"David was awesome. He went beyond to give us great service. Love the new location. Cant wait too come back."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I had just come from New Orleans, and these guys are doing it right! I got the hot and juicy special sauce in medium, Spicy and extra spicy. Yes I ate 3 pounds of crawfish don't judge they're delicious!"}
{"text":"This was a spontaneous lunch stop that was totally worth it.  I am from New Orleans and not easily impressed but I definitely left satisfied. Nereida was a hoot and helpful when making suggestions that would enhance my experience."}
{"text":"Went here with my Southern family who were visiting from the South. We were HUNGRY, and thought this would really do the trick. The wait to be seated was a bit much since it is a tiny restaurant, the waitress who seated us seemed bothered. However, our original waitress was on point and very friendly. The seafood in the bag all tasted the same no matter what you ordered. It was ok, but I bet I could find better."}
{"text":"Came in to enjoy a late lunch with the homies and this location didn't disappoint! I usually go to the location on Spring Mtn and Valley View, but I'll definitely make this one a priority. Our server, Max, was super attentive and got us squared away with food and drinks quick! Can't beat that kind of customer service!"}
{"text":"We put on our senior citizen eating schedule hats at 4:00pm yesterday more to be able to get into about the crazy-busiest parking schmear in Chinatown than to get a seat at HnJ Crawfish. I swirled my car in to the first space about a quarter mile up and heaved a sigh of relief. We hiked down and it did not take more than 15 minutes to be escorted to our table. I love the look of the ceiling and light fixtures and really appreciated seating that does not put my elbows on the next couple's table. Already big stars for this great space. No kidding- I had to look at the ceiling because the tables were hotbeds of orange spice colored plastic gloves, worn by immaculately dressed women and men fishing into huge bags of colorful crawfish and shrimp. It was like a movie about starvation but you had to wear gloves. Little kids and parents were chowing down on the table's contents, happy as clams, no pun intended. My husband had whispered \"Crawfish\" all the way here. I suggested he get the 2 pound bag of crawfish because there would be spiced corn and a potato in the bag to fill him up. Meanwhile I ordered the catfish basket with sweet potato fries and a Sapporo. Hot, delicious and non-messy....  Back to his side of our table-- the man with the hot spicy crawfish pulled tiny bits of fish from the shells and exclaimed that now he needed a meal to fill him up! We laughed! Seriously? This former auto body repairman who had his bleeding hands tied up with duct tape and bandages to finish a job says \"This was too much work.\" We both want to come back for Dungeness crab, oysters and shrimp. Great experience- good food and attentive, helpful staff. Next time if you come- take a shuttle or bus or even walk- the parking lot is scary as hell after 5. Ps he walked not far away and honestly- he ate a crepe filled with strawberries and covered with whipped cream and chocolate. (My catfish basket did not require any embellishment or crepes.) You can bet we jogged in our pool under the Supermoon last night to work off the meals!!"}
{"text":"Came here last weekend with my gf and parents. The food is pretty good and the service was okay. I ordered the pound of snow crabs and a pound of shrimp and got the mild seasoning. Let me warn you, the mild is definitely spicy. The only complaint I had was that the food didn't come out all at once. My parents had to wait for some of their food 20 min after I had my food come out. But overall, this is a nice place to eat some decently priced seafood."}
{"text":"I only came here because my coworkers recommended this place and said it was better than  Boiling Crab. Honestly i was so disappointed.. shrimp was chewy, sausage was not good at all and sauce not so impressed. Boiling crab is nothing compared to this, so much better!  Only thing I liked was the calamari really, which is why I'm giving it two stars, otherwise it would have been 1 :( ... sorry but I think this place is overrated ..."}
{"text":"If you love seafood and spices this is definitely a must!! We came around 4 and the place was packed the whole time we were there. Good service - they only serve beers and one wine, a Riesling, solely by the bottle. We got 1lb of crawfish 1 dungeness crab, and a few sides. All great tasting. You can get spice levels 1-5 on each dish."}
{"text":"Just had dinner here last night w/ the gals!!!!  Awesome as always and we had some newbies w/ us & got them hooked. Already hungry again and planning our next visit!!!!"}
{"text":"Garlic garlic garlic! Holy garlic! I smelled of garlic for 3 days after I had a pound of crawfish here. Once I got the house special sauce the next time I got the cajun boil. Either way I freakin' smelled of garlic for days.  I can eat pretty spicy stuff but anything over the medium here... is FIRE to me. Expect to drink a lot of water or beer with your meal. When it's that spicy, your tongue just dies and there's nothing subtle to pick up about flavors, it's just pain.  Service was very average. It might as well have been a server from a casino buffet giving us our drinks. Don't expect much from the atmosphere either. There ain't nothing pretty about this place.  Though it's not a place to come for amazing food or service, I still come back occasionally because I find myself craving the salt and the garlic. :)"}
{"text":"Love their original sauce (I normally get hot!). Oysters are good too. So much better than boiling crab hands down. Just more flavor here. A must try!"}
{"text":"I am a fan.  I wish they had more flavor options that were not AS spicy, because even their lightest spice is a bit too spicy for my younger kids.  BUT, we enjoy it."}
{"text":"Lack of management being present. Service is slow. Food was good. We won't return because they take to long to take your order and bring out your food and it wasn't even full."}
{"text":"Came by for the first time with my girlfriend and my two other friends as a couple date, my waiter was Phil he helped us out and explained the menu since it was our first time. Thanks Phil the food was great and the atmosphere was even better!"}
{"text":"So very disappointed in this place. We stopped in last night for dinner. We wanted something different. We ordered crawfish, shrimp and crab legs and beer. The beer was great. That's the only good thing I can say about this place. The crawfish were so small there was nothing in them. We never received our shrimp or crab legs. Did I mention that the beer was good?  Do yourself a favor and go around the corner for pizza. It was really good."}
{"text":"First time having crawfish and I wasn't disappointed. Flavor and spice levels for every tastebud. Really enjoyed the hot and juicy medium crawfish,lemon butter crab legs and hot lemon pepper shrimp! Fun place to go with delicious food and friendly waitstaff. Our server Alicia (what a beautiful name ) even put on gloves to show us the proper way to eat a crawfish. My new favorite place."}
{"text":"Still very good. The Crayfish were a bit small so we ordered some shrimp done the same way to fill our bellies. We lost our big iPhone and they were nice enough to hand it to our Uber driver an hour later. very cool!"}
{"text":"Some of the Best seafood around. \"Garlic & Butter\" anything! Scrumptious to say the least. Go H&J!"}
{"text":"Hot N Juicy is an experience as much as it is a delicious dining destination. Where else can you don bibs and suck away on crab legs, shrimp and clams doused in \"hot n juicy\" chili sauce (or garlic butter or lemon pepper, depending on your preference) that arrive in plastic bags?  Every table has two paper towel rolls, 'cuz this restaurant knows it's gonna get messy. I couldn't take any photos because they would've come out looking nasty. But looks are deceiving!  The sauces are heavenly. I suggest you try all of them. Wash the seafood down with mozzarella sticks and cajun fries (or sweet potato fries, if that's your thing). Trust me on this.  Haven't been to Boiling Crab so can't make a comparison in that regard, but I was very, very happy with Hot N Juicy!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place, the food has always been on point and staff is extremely friendly. Try the lemon pepper shrimp baby spice and spicy if you're willing to walk on the spicy side."}
{"text":"Pretty awesome spot for crawfish, shrimp and sausage.  As other reviewers have suggested, you are going to get dirty, as will your sleeves if you're wearing a long sleeve shirt.  The crawfish at this place are huge.  I got a couple pounds of crawfish with half pound of sausage added in- that was just the right amount of food. I ordered it medium hot with the hot n juicy sauce (would like to try the Louisiana seasoning another time).  It wasn't overpoweringly hot and the corn/sausage helped cool it off.  I would put it between 2-3, closer to 2.  I also ate a few of my buddy's shrimp cooked in the same sauce.  Honestly they were kind of bland after peeling them, so I just ended up dipping them in the crawfish sauce which helped a lot with flavor. We sat at the bar and got great service from Jasmine.  Highly recommended if you love crawfish and don't mind getting dirty!"}
{"text":"This place was so good that we went twice on our trip to Vegas -- the day after we got there and the day we left.  The crawfish were pretty small when I ordered them (the waitress told us they would be) but they were succulent and sweet and more or less worth it. The shrimp and crab legs were better though. I liked the hot n juicy special medium (which was super spicy the first time I came and milder the second time) and my boyfriend was a big fan of the lemon pepper mild. Sweet potato fries were awesome as well. The cajun fries were a bit spicy which would have been okay but my mouth was already burning from the seafood. Beers are cheap.  Definitely a fun eating experience as well. I would recommend the trip if you are in Vegas."}
{"text":"So happy they opened one on my side of town!  When we got there, there were still tables open. We had a party of 8, but the guy server refused to seat us until at least half of our party was present. Which the eighth was a four month old baby that wasn't even going to eat. It was understandable until the tables started filling up and the only table left was ours that a girl server purposely left reserved for us. Instead of the guy server out of courtesy asking us if the rest of the party was here, which they were, but were trying to find parking, (the parking isn't that great in this plaza by the way) he was pretty darn close to just seating the next party that arrived. I felt that was rude in and inconsiderate as we were patiently waiting. The least he could have done was ask if they were here or not. They could have been walking to the door and he probably would have just seated the other party if it weren't for my husband telling the girl server that our party was parking. That was frustrating.  We finally sat down and ordered. When it came to us waiting for the food, it was taking a lot longer than I had experienced at the other two Hot N Juicy's on Spring Mountain. We were probably waiting about 45 minutes to an hour. We only ordered shrimp and the rest were chicken baskets. The other two would have the food out a lot quicker.  Definitely no more than a 20 minute wait after ordering.  Every time we needed something we had to keep looking for our server as he never really came to check up on us.   At this location, I felt the service was about a 1 1/2 stars. I love the food and the location which bumped my rating to 3 stars. I love how they have a sink in the hall to avoid the clutter in the bathrooms. I would choose this location as my least favorite out of the three, but since it's less than 10 minutes away from where I stay, I will be returning for that reason."}
{"text":"Like any other hot n juicy around...its next to Buffalo Wild Wings and Nacho Daddy.  Had to wait about 10 mins to get a table for six. We ordered shrimp, fried catfish, calamari and corn fritters, plus two cajon fries. They were put of blue crab...boo!!  Everything was good and they kept the water glasses full, brought extra gloves for the ladies, etc.  Wish they would add some French bread to dip in the juice from the shrimp, etc.!!!"}
{"text":"Being an alumni of LSU I had high hopes for this place.  I'm not a fan of heads, legs, tails on shrimp coming out in a kitchen garbage bag.  Food was decent, atmosphere ok, experience and service lacking.  I will say the hubby LOVED his shrimp!"}
{"text":"We came here the month they opened and it was jam packed and we had to wait over an hour next door to be seated in this cramped place.   I told them I had an allergy to shrimp and crawfish when I ordered my clams, potatoes and sausages and then I stared feeling sick and realized there were shrimp heads and fur in my food.   I told the waitress and she said I shouldn't eat there then, so now I don't!  I really like the Las Vegas location of this chain but this one stinks...."}
{"text":"I came to the Glendale location with my family for Father's Day and was completely disgusted. There was a spill on the floor within minutes of us being seated. We saw three servers/employees attend to the spill. They used their bare hands to wipe the floor and pick up ice, have their bare hands all over your the dirty mop bucket and mop head. This would not have been an issue if any of them would have went to wash their hands before continuing to serve drinks and food. One of these employees was even grabbing the cups by rim with her dirty hands and serving drinks to customers in them! I did bring this to the managers attention, who seemed disinterested and blew me off by say, \"don't worry\" and \"I got it right now\" as he turned away and didn't let me finish what I was saying. He then said to the employees, \"everyone wash your hand\", which no one did! Needless to say, I will not be returning or recommending this establishment to anyone! I will make the extra 20 min drive to Angry Crab where the staff is friendly and sanitary and the food is better."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorites on the planet Earth and I encourage Vegas visitors to take a short ride over to Chinatown to experience this place. The garlic scent summons you in from the parking lot and once inside, (if you're a garlic lover), you just want to stay there. We had the shrimp and crablegs and I could go on eating them forever!  One tip, do NOT forget to get the corn. It is brought to you in the bag along with your seafood and garlicky goodness (get the Hot n Juicy special). I have never had better corn. Oh, and do NOT wear fancy clothes there. You WILL smell like garlic for a few days...but I really didnt care. It was worth it!"}
{"text":"Service was good. They were very busy but got us seated quickly... I think we took longer deciding what to order then it actually took to get or food. I would definately be back."}
{"text":"Amazing service. Amazing food. Would definitely recommend over other crab boil places."}
{"text":"What you can expect: Delicious Cajun food and the only one around probably! What you should be prepared for: shitty service. Food takes forever!!! You'll probably lose your appetite from waiting and here's why: we ordered an appetizer and entree at the same time and 20 minutes later we asked why our APPETIZER hasn't came. The girl explained to us that since we ordered em at the same time, they're gonna come at the same time. WHAT IS THAT??? Appetizer is supposed to come first that's why it's called an Appetizer!! But get this!! At the same time she was explaining that, another waiter came and dropped off the appetizer!!! Guess she was just talking out of her ass instead of checking first.  Probably deserve like 2 stars but 3 stars for hot waitresses!!! Make sure you get seated on the left side!!   FYI don't eat with gloves on you'll ruin the tradition"}
{"text":"Such good food!!! I love this restaurant. It's REALLY MESSY. But worth it! You'll wear gloves and a bib it's pretty funny.   The shrimp is so fresh and the seasoning is ridiculous.   I would definitely try this place again."}
{"text":"Absolutely five star!!! We drove by this location and decided to give a try. My husband and I went to Orlando's Hot N Juicy and we love it a lot. This one really surprised us! Service is great!!! That Asian girl is the best server I ever seen. She's so friendly and warm. I don't even need to say food. Everything is so perfect here. Yes! We would like to come back and will recommend this to every of my friends who will visit Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I've been to Angry Crab, Lacrab Shack and now HJ Crawfish....the seafood bags are pretty equally tasting which is very good!! I grew up eating endless whole prawns so it's right up my alley...the heads are the best part!! I shared the crab legs, crawdads, and shrimp with my daughter. Of course the crab went quickly but lots of the other for lunch the next day. Oh yes and steamed rice is very yummy and great with spicy sauce on it! I get the one that combines all the spices and medium spicy which is verrry spicy for me I finally decided will go for mild spicy next time. Disappointed no gumbo for my husband. It was my daughter's choice turning 20yo so Friday night here in Mill Ave is fun!"}
{"text":"The hostess was wonderful and than it went down hill from there. The waitress (never told us her name) was sweet but not very attentive. The food came fast and it wasn't bad except the calamari was over cooked and no flavor. When the food came we had to ask for bibs she went to get them but we needed one more but she was no where to be found (the place wasn't that busy and my daughter is a server, so we know excellent service) I asked someone else who told her and ten minutes later it was brought over to us. She checked on us once in 30 minutes and nothing after that. We wanted to order more crab legs but once again she wasn't around (I guess an assistant manager) we asked to order more crab legs and a beer never got the beer but it was on the check, never received the salt I asked for, never refreshed our drinks... We had to tell her to take the bags with the shells from the table and she looked confused...Never came back to get our payment took it to the front. The hostess apologized and asked if we wanted to speak to a manager but the damage was done, we will not be returnng and we were there because it was my daughters 23rd Birthday!!! We are not big complainers at all, but the service was just horrible! My daughter said the one in Glendale was way better. I have been to Angry Crab many times and will continue to go there instead!"}
{"text":"I go here to eat once every 2 weeks.  The crawfish seasoning is getting better the last 2 times.  It's one of the best in town."}
{"text":"We have been here many times! And we love it!! But tonight, Alice, the waitress, she is wonder and amazing!! So nice and helpful!!   Love the food, I will defiantly come back again and again!!"}
{"text":"Definitely recommend!!  The spices that compliment the shrimp and crawfish are on point!  It is a bit of a messy meal so you may want to reconsider coming here if you plan on doing something afterwords.  It seems there is always a wait here due to its exposure from food network shows but definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"The simple pleasures of having a pound of crawfish all to myself is unexplainable!   Before you dig into your plastic bag of seasoned seafood, I would advise you to put on the proper gear. Slip that logo-imprinted plastic apron on and secure those gloves, because you are in for some hot mess. I happily obliged prior to feasting through my bag of frozen Louisiana crawfish in the mildly spiced hot n juicy sauce. For the next 15 minutes, my gloved hands and lips were dripping in red. Piece after piece, I was stuffing my face in what seemed to be the most satisfying meal ever. Keep in mind, all of this was a mere $6.99.   I would come here anytime and every time I am in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Very good food. Wanted to compare the urban station to them so me and my fiancé tried them yesterday and we was taking by them! They are so much better more reasonable and give you more for your monies worth! We order 2 pounds of shrimp, fried fish, rolls, and fried chicken and wasn't no more then $40! It was an awesome experience with friendly and fun staff! Place was packed but made sure to bring out food hot and in a timely matter. Will be back in a couple of days!"}
{"text":"Good place for Cajun style seafood, I have to admit, it's messy, but GOOD! My favorite is the pound of shrimp in a bag drowned in sauce. You have a choice of four or five savory sauces. FYI, you have to peel the shrimp, it's all part of the experience.  The atmosphere is casual, it's a place to have a good time with friends!"}
{"text":"Good place for Cajun style seafood, I have to admit, it's messy, but GOOD! My favorite is the pound of shrimp in a bag drowned in sauce. You have a choice of four or five savory sauces, watch the spicyness, you can choose from 1-5. If you're not used to spicy food's, start low and work your way up. FYI, you have to peel the shrimp, it's all part of the experience.  The atmosphere is casual, it's a place to have a good time with friends!"}
{"text":"I was so appalled. They give you your food in PLASTIC BAGS. No plates, no silverware, styrofoam cups, bibs, and plastic gloves. And there's just a roll of paper towels sitting there. And I was confused by everything, so I asked the server, \"Do we get plates at all?\" And she said \"Your table's kind of your plate.\" Real nice. So I guess I should've known better, but at the end when I asked for a to go box, we just got another grocery bag. The food did take a long time because that place is PACKED. I don't know why, though. And it was really annoying to have to peel everything ourselves. I've never done that before so it was really difficult to do all that and barely get anything to eat after all the work you do. It was very messy. And that place is pretty expensive, so I guess I expected to be served a little classier for that amount of money. If I ever do get their food again, I would get it to go so that I can have my dinner on a plate like a civilized person."}
{"text":"Called ahead for lunch on Sunday to see if they had raw oysters and blue crab listed as on their website.  They said yay on oysters nay on blue crab but we parked n got there and they did not have oysters And the lobster is not by the pound as it shows on the menu.  Double bummer as we chose it for our lunch during work..."}
{"text":"Best shrimp I have had in a long time. Try 1lb hot and juicy spicy.  Everything was delicious."}
{"text":"I could write up a more thorough review of this fine restaurant, but it would only reiterate what has already been said. What I will say, though, is that you should only order a spice level of Mild OR LOWER!  Unless, of course, you're fond of holding lit matches to your lips. It's spicy!"}
{"text":"Gifts from the sea offered up in boil bags full of tasty seasoning. Lots of fun, flavor and definitely spices. I've always been a fan of these types of spots. This was my first visit to Hot N Juicy which had me curious as what to expect. Since I've eaten at other restaurants with similar concepts of boil bags. I was hoping my experience would be an enjoyable one. Like most of these places you order your shrimp, mussels, lobster, or crab by the pound. After selecting to get the shrimp, with Hot N Juicy flavor for my seasoning selection. I went baby spicy for the heat level which I would recommend for anyone who can't handle too spicy of food. The heat level seems to run a bit high even for the lower options of baby spice, mild, or medium. With the snow crab legs we got garlic butter which was perfect. What was also impressive was the breaded fried shrimp! Perfect job of breading really complimented the batter flavors. It's an all around win if you're looking for a chance to get your fingers dirty with a little bit of sweating involved. Check it out if you have a small party or large I'm sure you'll have a great time!"}
{"text":"Every time I come to Vegas, I want to try this place but never get the chance. This trip I made it a priority and was the first restaurant to hit on my Vegas weekend and I will definitely come back regardless of reeking of garlic after walking out of the place. Even the next day i could still smell the garlic on the clothes that I wore to the restaurant.  Everything we ate was delicious!! My bf and I ordered a pound of shrimp and a pound of the crawfish both in the medium hot n juicy special sauce. And let me tell you, the medium was still very spicy. I'm glad I didn't get the hot. My lips were tingling with the medium and I love spicy food. We also got and order of the cajun fries and a side of rice. I put some of the sauce on the rice and that was super delicious!!   Other reviews say how packed this place gets. Not the case on a thursday night. We were seated immediately, however there was a good sized line when we left. Service was great and the food was wonderful. Our next trip out we will definitely be stopping for a bite again."}
{"text":"Nice to not have to wait long to be seated, but the kitchen has issues with getting our food out in a timely matter.  Despite the other locations having a wait time to get seated, at least the food comes out much more quicker."}
{"text":"After visiting this restaurant my wife, cousin and their kids were very ill.  We know this is where she got her sickness because we went there with 12 people and the ones that ate the shrimp and snow crab were the only ones sick. Went to the hospital and they diagnosed them with Campylobacter jejuni....BACTERIA FOUND IN FECES!   Doctor said its probably due to employees not washing hand after handling raw foods or using the washroom.  DISGUSTING!!!!"}
{"text":"This is beyond fresh and the name says it all hot and juicy be prepared to experience something new. Not one buffet can offer the tenderness of this spicy yummy shrimp clams and crawfish everything is beyond on point. If you guys come to Las Vegas and don't want to get ripped off with ridiculously over priced crap that taste old and tuff come here and be pampered by the service and enjoy the food....atmosphere !!! We are going back before we leave back home yum!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow, prepared to be blown away by the intense flavors that are this casual eatery's signature.  We ordered several pounds of crawfish (hot & juicy, mild), shrimp (hot & juicy, mild), chicken wings, and snow crab.  We also had sides of rice and creole fries.  Even though we ordered mild, these crawfish really pack some heat and a lot of garlicky goodness. The corn that comes in the bag is so saturated with the yummy sauce, and I wish there were more corn cobs in the bag.  I also wish I had some bread to sop up all the sauce. I actually enjoyed the shrimp and snow crab more than I did the crawfish, probably because there's more meat and the shell is easier to peel. This is a place where you get down and dirty, bibs and all (gloves optional).  Really fun and worth checking out."}
{"text":"Been here so many times, I can't believe I haven't reviewed it. My favorite is shrimp hot n' juicy style.  We love the sweet potato fries , too. I use them to soak up the delicious sauce.  Make sure to get corn, too- so good! Someone in our party got the crab and didn't care for it.  The crawfish is pretty good, but I still go for the shrimp.  Looking forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"This is becoming my staple Birthday feast extravaganza.  Been here a few times now, and decided it was time for a review.  First things first, try and go during non peak hour times to avoid a wait for a table and having to walk a bit do to the limited parking.  Now it's all amazing from there.  Every time I have been here the staff and accommodations are amazing.  Today was nothing different. Our waitress was spot on in every aspect and I could not have asked for more.  The food was right out and we ordered a lot.  Four pounds of shrimp, a pound of mussels, two orders of nuggets, two orders of fries, corn on the cob, potatoes, and sausages; with a few different sauces to try. (Told you; birthday feast lol)  As with ever time prior the food is amazing, with more than enough flavor. The portions are beyond reasonable, and I have never left feeling hungry.    Being able to make a mess while ripping through this seafood overload and sharing the experience with your group is what this spot is all about.  Despite the limited parking and sometimes long wait this is a five star experience.  If you have never been, get a couple of people, venture down, and take the plunge into this pool of messy delight.  Thank you Hot and Juicy for being you over and over again.  See you next time."}
{"text":"Food was great as always. But I had a huge problem with the waitress Kayla. She  never came by the table to refill my wife's drink or ask if I wanted another beer. She was easily the worst waitress I've ever had. She was extremely rude and I will not be back to this location due to her incompetence."}
{"text":"Big fan of Man vs Food and the Travel Channel, so we had to come try this place out. We don't really like Crawfish so we order Shrimp instead. we have tried different seasonings they offer but end up liking the hot n juicy special seasoning extra spicy. It has so much flavor."}
{"text":"Ate here on a recent overnight visit for work.    Got serveral pounds of crawfish in hot and spicy.  I wasn't too impressed.  The sauce was good but the crawfish were kinda dried up and weren't juicy or slurpy at all.  Sausage, corn, etc is all good.  We also got a couple lobsters at market price (I wasn't paying so I didn't see the bill).  The lobsters were good, better quality than the crawfish.    Overall I can't say that this place blew me out of the water.  If I'm up for something different then maybe.   This is really a 2 star review but I'm giving them 3 cause their servers are great eye candy."}
{"text":"This place is DELICIOUS.  PROS: Clams             Shrimps             Lemon Pepper sauce             Hot N Juicy Special sauce             Louisiana Style sauce"}
{"text":"I first heard of theis place from Diner's Drive-in's & Dives on the Food Channel & since I was living in Vegas @ the time I thought to try it out when family came to visit. Well, needless to say, I;ve returned time & time again. EVERYTHING on the menu is great. I love the no frills, what you see is what you get. Styrofoam cups, plastics table coverings & rolls of papers on the table. I don't think there is a plate to be found in the building. While there all you see are people licking, sucking & eating as well as picking out the newbies to eating crawfish.  As for the wait, I've never experienced it although I've seen it. I always seem to get there @ the perfect time. Just so you know, you can order take out & it seems as if I enjoyed that better, then I could go home & really pig out.  Just know that you want to roll in there in something you don't mind getting butter on. You just can't help it.  Most items you buy by the pound  **************YOU GET A DISCOUNT IF YOU PAY USING CASH****************** ************PARKING IS VERY LIMITED, BUT WORTH IT***************************"}
{"text":"My server David was the best it was my first time eating here and here and I didn't know that the shrimp came with the heads still on. David was so awesome he took all of the heads off the shrimp and even coved them up so that I didn't have to see them... Super Sweet"}
{"text":"I'd give 6 stars. Good seafood, excellent server. I love Hot N Juicy, it's one of my favourite restaurant in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"My favorite Hot n Juicy in AZ! Mainly cause of the awesome service from Duy! Thanks for always making it a pleasant visit and never messing up our orders! ... And we always order a lot!   I usually order crawfish in hot n juicy mild with a side of rice, clams and they're Cajun fries AND if I'm feeling splurgy I'll order the lobster\crab too   Great food, service and reasonably priced! highly recommend to everyone! But if you prefer extremely oily and bland food check out Angry Crab   TIP: please ignore the ignorant reviews from people who don't understand the concept of the place and prefer their shrimp/lobster headless SMFH"}
{"text":"I had dinner here last night for the first time & it was amazing! Loved the food so much & our waitress was awesome. I will say though next time I'll be getting the gloves because I cannot get the hot & juicy smell off of my fingers, other than that 5 stars from me!"}
{"text":"The food is good, fun atmosphere, attentive wait staff. The wife and I tried a pound of crawfish as well as a pound of shrimp. Delicious. The sweet potato fries were crisp, the calamari a bit bland.  I get IT, I just don't like IT. I do not enjoy working this hard to feed myself. I do not enjoy how dirty/greasy one gets. I have done this once, I'm good, never again."}
{"text":"OMG hands down the freshest seafood I've had outside of the fish market in DC! Such a great experience with the bib and gloves however I took those things right off and got down to business! If I'm going to eat with my hands I'm going to eat with my hands!!! I ordered snow crab legs and shrimp. Hell even the corn and potato were delicious! The sauces were awesome! This was my sixth time going to Vegas and my first time eating here. Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Great service. Good flavors. The crawfish is just puny and expensive for what I'm used to in TX."}
{"text":"Food was good... But service was terrible!  We had a large party and they wouldn't split the bill and yet the bill was long and waitress took order ran out of room and wrote on the back of the ticket.  Well the orders on the back of the ticket never got imputed and it took an hour for then rest of our party to get their food and all the waitress and manager did was argue and have them 20% off that was it!  It wasn't about the free flipping meal it was that they messed up and wouldn't take credit for it !  Terrible won't be going back."}
{"text":"Not sure if it was because I went with a huge expectation but it was a let down... not to mention that I had my heart set on going to boiling crab but the taxi driver was more familiar with this location that we opted out for it.  Its playful and fun eating with your hands and the flavor was good but It was not a wow factor for me.  Ended up eating more fries than anything."}
{"text":"Went here for a late lunch after finding a four star, casual, place on Yelp with over 500 reviews and two $$ rating,  my kind of place...  I can't help but compare it to the Boiling Crab in LA since everything about it is virtually the same, even the sweet potato fries, and the half corn on the cob in the bag.  But for those of you who aren't familiar with the Boiling Crab chain, it a crab boil in a pouch too with only one minor difference that mattered to me:  here they offer etouffee instead of gumbo, and I think I prefer Boiling Crab's gumbo over HNJC's etouffee...  The other difference between the two is that there isn't this insane wait to get in like the Boiling Crab always seems to have, which is great for HNJC.  The four of us ordered:  Sweet Potato Fries ($4.25):  these were long and slender deep fried sweet potatoes and came with ketchup on the side.   Ok, but I don't like sweet potatoes that much... http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/UNI1agsPX2k3eJSJVB91nw?select=9ouHMxvk3Ajz4FZsTNLJxQ  Chicken Wings Basket (5 pieces)  ($7.95):  these wings served on a bed of regular fries and come with ranch dressing and ketchup.  The wings were nice and lightly fried, very moist and juicy.  Good... http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/UNI1agsPX2k3eJSJVB91nw?select=IooJdoITYr8QFM_qBcVMSQ  2 Etouffee plus 1 bowl of rice ($6.99 x2 plus $2):  the etouffee had a consistency like coarse oatmeal, had a little heat in it, and already had some rice in it.  Even with the rice already in it, it needed the additional rice to tame the spice which was more like a peppery heat than anything else.  I like gumbo more than etouffee, but even then, I had a really kick ass etouffee at a NY street food fair recently... http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/UNI1agsPX2k3eJSJVB91nw?select=k8YQoV8gLp64rbPXyY5rsw  1 lb Crawfish ($9.99 lb):  had the Hot n Juicy Special seasoning without any additional spice level.  The flavor was definitely there, not too spicy which is the way I like it,  it's just that eating crawfish is too much work.  I usually choose shrimp because it's the best deal, the shell is light and easy to peel, so there is more meat to shell ratio.  We had two corn on the cobs in the bag and they were tasty as usual because they absorbed all of the flavor in the bag... http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/UNI1agsPX2k3eJSJVB91nw?select=Aa8X2cG2oAMY5kLgLzonxA  1 lb Shrimp w/Lemon Pepper ($10.99 lb): 1 lb Shrimp w/Garlic Butter ($10.99 lb);  I treat both of these the same since the spice level on both was mild.  Like I said above, I think shrimp is the best deal because you don't pay too much for the shell and you get a lot of meat... http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/UNI1agsPX2k3eJSJVB91nw?select=_Ja-CD62sFXd2EPpiEnU8A  The service was great, the girls who waited on us were attentive but not hovering...  I would probably come back, but since I don't live close by that presents a problem..."}
{"text":"With the spot on \"Man V. Food\" tv show I had to check this place. I came on Fat Tuesday for the crawfish specialty and man did it deliver. It was delicious from first bite to last, and the staff is incredibly nice and helpful. I do plan on brining my family again"}
{"text":"First of all, parking here sucks. You'd be better off parking across the street and trying to play Frogger with your life on Spring Mountain (not recommended). Avoid the peak hours or make friends with the people who live down the street (or at the Asian massage parlor next door - score!)  The shrimp was great (lemon butter sauce!). I also really enjoyed the Catfish. The crawfish in the namesake however was way too much work for way too little meat. Also, their 'mild' is my 'spicy' though I still enjoyed tearing those bodies apart like some hungry, homicidal Cloverfield.  The old man footed the bill during a visit to his favorite son and daughter in-law on the 9th island. I would definitely come back on my own though, for that awesome catfish and shrimp. Dress down and get dirty for some cooked bottom feeders!"}
{"text":"Definitely not coming back again! First of all, the service was bad overall. We waited way too long for crawfish that never was served to us and their excuse was the kitchen was slow/backed up.  How could that be even possible if other tables that came after us got their food?? We cancelled our orders and their excuse was that the orders got mixed up with others.  If the order was taken correctly then it wouldn't be a HOT MESS!"}
{"text":"I went to this location for the first time in 2 years. It was very busy but we got seated really quick. Our servers were very friendly , attentive, and funny. We ordered clams, shrimps, and snow crabs with lemon peppers and garlic butter sauce. Overall they were great but they were a little bit salty in the garlic butter sauce. Definitely, recommending to everyone to come and try out."}
{"text":"Our friends decided to try this place because we had a bad experience at Angry Crab.  First, I think time is important. We came in around 4ish and were seated right away. The place had plenty of seating left. By 530-6, the place filled up quick.   This might be a good experience or the restaurant is always like this, who knows. But for my one experience so far, it was pretty good! Prices were quite reasonable. We tried the crawfish, oysters and clams. The crawfish had good color and was very juicy and plump.  I haven't had any this good since I visited CA. You get a free potato and corn for every 2lbs. Take the corn out or it will get mushy. I wish they would cut up the potatoes. We broke it down ourselves to make it easier to eat and distribute. Oysters were raw, fresh and were very decent sizes. Clams were only OKAY. They were VERY gritty.   Our friends got the shrimp and king crab. They only got 2lb of shrimp and couldn't even finish. They swear the portions are way larger than Angry Crab's (even though since it should be the same since it's by weight!).  We got Hot and Juicy sauce for everything. The sauce didn't really mix with the seafood well. You would have to do that yourself. They used a lot of spices and garlic which made it tasty. As expected, the sauce sort of gets thick and bitter/salty towards the end/bottom so watch out for that.   You get the customary bibs and the tables are lined with protective sheets. The table situation is sort of awkward because it's literally just putting tables anywhere they can and the whole place is an open area, meaning you might just be sitting in the middle surrounded by a bunch of people. This is a smaller store but you might have guessed that from the location.  They give you a roll of paper napkins (thank goodness) and you get wet wipes if you choose but there's always the bathrooms (which are clean, yay).  Docked star for various reasons. Parking sucks. Our friend got towed. Be careful! Second, we got treated by three different servers. They all provided great service and I get this is a busy-style restaurant but that meant the messages didn't always get across. Had to ask two people for more water and split bills because the original person didn't do it or communicate it and we had to correct the order with two different people. Third, the sauce is pretty tasty but the consistency seems off.  Good experience, will come back!"}
{"text":"first visit ever, went on a tuesday night, atmosphere was awesome, place was packed, ordered king crab legs, snow crab legs, crawfish, potatoes and corn, everything was great, personal favorite and BEST ITEM ON THE MENU has got to be the snow crab,.....the different flavors and spices were perfect, cant wait to return to vegas to go for seconds!   HIGHLY RECOMENDED TO ANYONE WHO LIKES SEAFOOD  (im from baltimore so i know my crabs....)"}
{"text":"Ever since I have found the joys of Boiling Crab in California. ( http://www.kats9lives.com/2008/06/whole-sha-bang.html ) Since we were taking a family vacation and the parental units like good and cheap foods, I thought hey it would be nice to go Cajun and I came across this place.  For the full review and pics go to http://www.kats9lives.com/2008/07/hot-n-juicy-in-vegas.html  I don't know if this place or Boiling Crab came first, but I think Boiling Crab probably because they have a bunch of stores.  Either way they are both pretty good and a good value. ^_^   We ordered Shrimp, Crawfish, Fried Catfish, Wings, and more.  The sauce was good for the shrimp and crawfish.  It's light on the celery, which I like.  We got a bowl of rice to eat the rice with and that was really good.  It was too bad that they ran out of the gumbo.  The service was friendly and the food was good.  I think we decided that the shrimp is a better deal because you barely get any meat in the crawfish, but those crawfish are good! Just too much work! =P lol The prices at Boiling Crab are cheaper but Hot n Juicy Crawfish was a great find.  My family really enjoyed it and the bill was very reasonable.  If you like Cajun food and you are in Vegas then definitely stop by! ^_-"}
{"text":"This place is ridiculously yummy... Staff is exceptionally friendly and drinks not bad. First time in Tempe, I am a fan! That is all!"}
{"text":"All I can say about this place is wow my breath will smell like garlic for serval days lol. Love the oysters and their special cocktail dipping sauce they use. The oysters are washed and cleaned really well. Taste very fresh and no fishy smell or after taste. Ordered the usual Shrimp with Hot n Juicy mix. Medium spice. Definitely don't come here on a first date unless he or she is okay with smelling like garlic lol. Fun place to come with friends =] Would return =]"}
{"text":"Worst place for a first date. You get messy, gross, clumsy. Your food is looking back at you. You have to somehow find it in you to rip off this creatures head and suck out its brains. Its hard to walk out with not at least getting some stain on you even with gloves, a bib,...a hazmat suit. Saying all this.... I love this place.  I hadn't had more fun going to a restaurant with a group then I did going here. The experience was new to me since I never had crawfish before, nor had to break open my own shrimp. But it was a hilarious time and conversation starter just trying to get to your food.   The service was epic, our waiter was so courteous and and cared so much to make sure we were all having a good time.   The food was delicious one I got a hang of learning how to break the damn things open to get to the meat (I don't recommend going here if your really hungry, treat this place like everything your putting in your mouth is a delicacy because getting to the actual food is kind of a mission, so takes time and some effort to grub, which again makes this a great place for social gatherings and conversation as your eating is actually done very casually as most the time your spending breaking open shells and talking).   The prices are reasonable as well, maybe a bit expensive for a meal that you can't quite get very full off of but I feel still worth it as your paying for the experience of being there as well.  Overall I would recommend this place to anyone and would totally be back with others to show them the novelty of what eating crawfish is like."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The food is delicious!  Crawfish with lemon pepper seasoning is the best! Justin was a funny a great server.  I would recommend eating at this place if you love seafood"}
{"text":"I need 6 stars!  I'm pretty picky about seafood, but this place floored me!  I was looking at the lobster, but they were running over 2 pounds, so it would have been a bit too spendy. I settled on King Crab Legs, a pounds worth, done in the hot and juicy style with mild heat.   As I waited, I noticed a new item in the menu, fried pork rinds, so being raised on Canadian bacon, I selected it as an appetizer.   The rinds arrived still crackling like a bowl of Rice Krispies. Moments later my server dropped a bag of crab legs on my table.   I don't know what was better. The crab legs were the meatiest, sweetest and biggest I have ever enjoyed. But the sauce was a total win as well. I even went as far as to use the pork rinds like taco chips to eat the seasoning sauce.   My only regret was not ordering two pounds!  My many years eating in Vegas, and this was the best. Note to self:  rent a car so I can go for every meal next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"This place was an amazing experience for me! The waiters were really nice and caring!! Although the wait was pretty long it was well worth the wait. The crawfish were by far the best I've ever had. Although their other seafood are nothing to die about their crawfish is. Overall, delicious and friendly service!!!?!"}
{"text":"\"I'll have the usual please! 1 lb of Shrimp, Hot & Juicy special, less than mild + corn on the cobb!\"   Honestly, the best thing ever.  I always ask for less than mild because their spice rating is a little above average and my taste buds can't handle it! I like to also eat my shrimp with a side of white rice. Delicious!  All seafood orders are served in a plastic bag.  You are given a bib to eat so it doesnt go on your cloths.   It WILL get a little messy, so make sure youre not wearing white... unless you're extra careful. Also be prepared to smell like garlic for a few days! So worth it though! -- I also love their chicken wings w/ sweet potato fries.  Fun atmosphere, great staff.  Theyre always attentive.  Only complaint i have is that when I ask for less than mild for my spice level, its always a hit or miss. Sometimes its spicer than other days.... so its never consistent. I've had to send my shrimp back on a few occasions.  Other than then when its perfect, its PERFECT!"}
{"text":"Came here for one thing and they didn't have it.  Ettoufe. They've only been open 1 hour and it's not going to be ready for another hour.  That's so lazy.  The staff here isn't friendly or remorseful. Very unwelcoming. Also, the water here is disgusting.  I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Visited this place on 8/6/17 while visiting Las Vegas.  The staff was Ok.  I had a party of 5. We ordered drinks first, then we ordered 3 bags of seafood and two po- boys.  The only issues I had with this place is that it was unorganized as far as when they brought the food out.  They brought out our bag of crawfish first, then 15 minutes later brought out one bag of shrimp, 20 minutes later they brought out another bag of shrimp.  They brought out one po boy sandwich and brought out the other po boy sandwich 20 minutes later..... This is unacceptable.  An organized restaurant knows how to bring everything out at one time, or at least within a 5 minute range.  Other than that, the food was good, but the shrimp was overcooked, which made it hard to peel.  We picked the right seasonings for our steamed seafood. I would go back, but I would ask that everything come out on time."}
{"text":"This place is my inner circle social media's food porn hot spot. My friends, his cousin, our nieces all raved about Hot N Juicy so when we were planning a trip back to Vegas, it was definitely on our to do list.  We arrived on a Tuesday afternoon and there were still plenty of parking. We were greeted right away and were taken to our seats. We were thankful as other reviews indicated that it could get busy. Keep in mind there are two locations in Chinatown Vegas.  The menu was easy to follow. We ordered a pound of crawfish, 2 pounds of shrimp, sausage, and corn on the cob in Cajun style. It was scrumptious. The shrimp and crawfish weren't over cooked. It was seasoned well, flavoring was good, and it wasn't too spicy for my palate. It was rich and buttery goodness. Let the corn soak up all the sauce and then suck the juice and bite into it. Heavenly. You could even order a side of rice.   Our waitress was attentive and she refilled our drinks regularly. She was well mannered and positive. This was one meal that we enjoyed most in Vegas. It was such a great experience. A must visit when we return."}
{"text":"Great shrimp, sausage, and corn! They serve it up to you in a plastic baggy with their spicy sauce. Be sure to wear those bibs they provide. It's gonna get a little messy...  You can order your sauce mild to extra spicy. Us \"wimps\" ordered a bag of mild and a bag of medium (sorry, I like to enjoy my food while not having my mouth numb with fire).  Actually, compared to other places I've been to, their mild was like medium  and medium was HOT HOT HOT! but it was all good. I was still able to enjoy the taste because the spicyness didn't really bite, it just built up as I came close to finishing the bag.  I prefer shrimp over the crawfish because the shrimp is meatier and well worth peeling over the crawfish. The calamari rings and fries we ordered was a nice filler to absorb some of that spice!"}
{"text":"Ordered a pound of crawfish in the Hot N Juicy special sauce (basically all of the flavors mixed together - Louisiana, Cajun, lemon pepper, garlic butter) with spicy for the heat level.  HOLY SHIT...the sauce is insanely delicious. I'm a sauce kind of guy, and man this stuff is legit. ***note to self: figure out copy cat recipe of the Hot N Juicy special seasoning.   Make sure to go all out when eating these little jewels. Suck on your fingers, fuck wearing gloves, don't be afraid to suck the juices in the head, and crack it open afterwards to get some of that \"head fat\"...mmm. Just thinking about it gets me feening.  Don't wear anything nice cause the juice is no joke. Your fingers will smell all day. Their men's restroom even reeks of it. LOL. It's a small price to pay, though."}
{"text":"Great staff and even better food! They don't open until noon and we came at 11. They gave us a table and water and let us order 15 minutes before opening. Then the food was outstanding! Best shrimp I've ever had!!! The atmosphere was relaxed and fun. Great place for any seafood lover or someone willing to try new things!"}
{"text":"Place was amazing. Quick service and great tasting food. Tried the \"get your feet wet\" great for 2 people but I tried my best to get through it. A lot of food for the price. Will come back next time I'm in town"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the crawfish in garlic sauce.  The crawfish themselves were good, but they were served in a plastic bag with probably a quart of sauce.    It's one thing to have spicy food, but when you have to put your hand into what amounts to a bag of soup to pull out the food, it's just too much.  I think those who chose crab legs and shrimp were happy, but the hot n juicy crawfish was a big disappointment.  Won't do this again and all in all, not what I would call a good experience."}
{"text":"The staff was nice and friendly, but the food and service was meh. I was so excited to try this spot out because I heard such great reviews about this place, but when when we ordered and got our food it was just okay. It was good, but not amazing. Besides the seafood freshness, the next important thing is the sauce and the sauce didn't really do it for me. When we got our food, the food runner gave us an extra half pound of shrimp instead of the half order of sausage. We flagged our server and she apologized and sent it back. Minutes later, the food runner gave us another bag of half pound shrimp.. Perhaps we didn't make ourselves clear enough before, but we sent it back again and told her that it was sausages not shrimp. It happened like again after and when we finally got the sausages, we weren't even hungry anymore.   For a small place with a lot of workers the service was a bit slow. Maybe it was just that one time we came in, but yeah maybe I'll come back.. But for the time being, my heart is where my favorite spot at home is."}
{"text":"Love it! Did shrimp with sausages and potatoes in the Hot and Juicy extra hot seasoning. We ordered to go. Def HOT and Juicy! Been to a lot of Creole and crawfish joints. This place is one of my favs!"}
{"text":"This is a family favorite!!! It's always a special treat when we come here. Super reasonably priced, and you have to work for those shrimp and crab meat but it's worth it!!  You get messy. You wear bibs. Your mouth is on fire from the spices/seasoning. You enjoy the fresh seafood at very reasonable pricing and you leave happy!!!   Love HNJ!!"}
{"text":"Hot and juicy crawfish? Nope. Yes it was hot but what it lacked was a significant amount of juiciness. But still 5 out of 5 stars because I don't like juice."}
{"text":"I love this place!! Lemon pepper srimp are yumm!! Sweet fry potato, etc ,etc prices are ok friendly service, a good place for lunch!!!"}
{"text":"Nice spots. My cousin is always dragging us here because she can't get enough of the food.  It is pretty good, the food doesn't come like I envision but I'll request how I envision going forward. I love how they provide the customers with an apron and gloves. Make sure you don't  wear clothes you care about or plan on washing right away because it will have you smelling like raw fish when you leave :-)"}
{"text":"the bomb! the location was perfect! Expect it to be pricey since it is located at the strip. Due to how busy the area was the servers tend to kind of ignore what u ask for. Make sure you ask them everything u need at one time so u wouldn't have to wait for extra order. The front lady was nice, i could tell they're all tired so i guess they don't smile that much anymore which is understandable! hahah the servings of the shrimps and sauces were even, which is so nice atleast i didn't ran out of sauce."}
{"text":"We wanted to visit this place b/c we saw it on that episode of Man vs. Food and when we visited Vegas we wanted a change from the restaurants available on the strip.  It was a good experience, the staff is super friendly.  We ordered 2lbs of the (spicy) hot & juicy crawfish and 1lb of the king crab, some sausages, corn and Cajun fries.  It was alright... satisfying, but definitely not the best I've ever had.  The crawfish were pretty small, and when they're small like that you have to work harder to get to the actual meat, which kinda sucked since the meat was super duper small.  The crab was really good, and I really liked the sausages, but I remember them being pretty expensive.  I think we paid an extra $6 to get six slices of andouille sausage.  The corn is the neutralizer, which is necessary if you can't handle the heat.    The cajun fries were so-so, our next trip we will do w/out them.  Next time, I'd like to try the shrimp and maybe clams (if they have them) and I'll probably try the medium instead of the spicy so I'm not constantly asking for more water."}
{"text":"Not too bad, the atmosphere was ok even though you eat off the table... but their dipping sauces were pretty good and it was a enjoyable restaurant but only 3 stars because it was kinda like we were being rushed and the waiter wasn't so nice.."}
{"text":"The battle is neck and neck! We did the taste test the other day. I'm solely basing this review on Hot N Juicay's medium special vs The new contender's medium whole shabang.   We got 4 pounds of snow crab, 1 pound of skrimps, and 1 pound of crawfish. I opt for the medium hot n juicy special for the seasoning. I saw white rice on the menu. WOOT!!! I'm not sure if they always served white rice here. I remembered asking for it at the original spot and got denied. Maybe they ran out back then. I was so glad to see it on the menu. I saw some cat post up a picture of rice that had the seasoning poured all over it. FOR REALLY DOE!!!  Not very long after I was stuffing my face like a pig, the spice started to make me sweat, but I couldn't stop eating. Believe me, it was an ugly sight. Pieces of shell all on my grill, juice running down my arms, beads of sweat forming on my cranium, crab meat chillen on the upper lip...YO!  Both places have GREAT flavor, although Hot N Juicy's medium spice got it on LOCK DOWN!!! Doesn't need no more or no less. Keep doing it yallz! EYE LIKA CHU PEOPLES!!!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place! We had Tad as a waiter he rocked! We came in after church and before watching Black Mass (good movie btw) My husband and I ordered 1 1/2 lbs of shrimp. The food was amazing the flavor was out of this world!  Tad did an amazing job of keeping our drinks filled since we got the shrimp spicy and boy they do not lie it was spicy but the flavor a just blended together so well.  We also got sweet potato fries and they were also very good!  Only one down fall it was our first time and I wish they had taken the time to explain the menu better but we can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We love this place! Qudos to the Chef that invented their sauce! It's always been perfect, never a dry ice, stale taste with their crawfish! Not oily, just PERFECT!"}
{"text":"Great food Service is ok I frequently dine at this location. Friendly people and always delicious food."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner one night. Love love love this place. We got a bunch of different things.. Crab, shrimp, etc. We got it medium and it was still super spicy. Anytime I can find one of this chain, I try to visit it. Would recommend to everyone who loves steamed shellfish."}
{"text":"I've never eaten in the restaurant, i always get it \"to go\".. stinks up my whole house, but its SOOOO GOOD :)  I always get the shrimp, its a little overcooked.. but good nonetheless. I've tried the crawfish..yummy, but just not patient enough to get to the tiny little bit of meat inside, haha. But overall, I LOVE THIS PLACE! Be warned though, I eat a lot of spicy food, but their \"medium\" here, is actually quite hot to me. Still good though! You get like 3% off if you pay cash, or something like that."}
{"text":"First impressions always matter & that's what Maddie had delivered. Asked what was recommended & it was the snow crab which was on point! S\O to the cooks and server Maddie, killed it!"}
{"text":"Like they say, hit and juicy. We had crawfish, snow crab legs, shrimp and muscles. Crawfish were whole frozen but they are out of season. Lots of garlic in the juice!"}
{"text":"Writing a review not for the food but for the service. Had a server named Michelle and ordered 2 shots of Hennessy. She came back with 2 clear shots of something. I told her this isn't Hennessy and she just yelled this is Hennessy like yelling was going to convince us it is. The food here is great but hot and juicy needs to do themselves a favor and eliminate ignorant employees ASAP."}
{"text":"Due to the hot n juicy staff's deficiency in basic customer service, neither I nor my associates in Vegas will be returning. It's owner should really re-evaluate his/her front of house team to avoid losing any more business than it alrdy has.  The level of etiquette they lack is profound.  Should they continue on the same path, their business levels will ultimately diminish.  Good luck."}
{"text":"Cool concept, I really liked the sea food. It was very well cooked and has a lot of flavor. This restaurant is not for everyone thought, and I don't think it's great value for your money. Especially for smaller party's because most things have to be purchased by the pound. It's also VERY messy"}
{"text":"This place was everything!! From service to food it was great! I love the set up of the restaurant the wait staff was friendly and the tunes were popping. The catfish is amazing and those crab legs were so Devine! I got the spicy hot and juicy flavors for the crab legs."}
{"text":"I think this is the best location for crawfish (away from crowded Chinatown).  Plenty of parking too.  It's bigger than the Chinatown location and even when it gets packed, there's never much of a wait and service is fast.    The size of the crawfish depends on the season, but nonetheless good every time!  That's the only reason why I'm giving this place 4/5 stars because of the crawfish size.  With 2 pounds of crawfish they throw in a potato and corn on a cob.    My favorite sauce is the Hot N Juicy Special.  You do need your bib...or atleast I do because it gets messy eating with your hands and handling all that sauce.  The sauce is absolutely amazing, and it's finger licking good!  Just imagine tasting buttery garlic lemony old bay seasoning sauce."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat crab and shrimp everrrrrrrr!! This place has it down to a science, the service is so fast and always on point. I would eat here everyday if my stomach allowed me haha. It's an addicting place!!  You haave to get at least a pound of snow crab and shrimp hot and juicy spicyyyy! And a potato on on the side so you can get some extra juice ;)"}
{"text":"SUCK THE HEAD.  That's the ONLY skill you need to have when eating crawfish, hold it firmly with your two fingers, twist, pull apart and suck them juices like nobody's biz!  This place maybe located off the strip but it shouldn't be off your radar, in fact, our whole group was so stoked to go here we decided a party bus was the only way to go.  We arrived VIP style only to find out that even VIPs had to wait too -- this is a first come, first served basis -- which means 45 mins. wait for our party of 13 on a Friday night.  We were absolutely starving by the time we got seated.  I was excited to see my Hot N Juicy mild 2 lb. crawfish come to the table.  It was served steaming hot in a plastic bag and it includes potato and corn.  It certainly lived up to its name, I was sweating bullets and constantly reaching for my cup of water -- 3 COLD cups -- to tame the hotness in my mouth.  I was with a bunch of Thai folks so you know they have had their share of SPICY food growing up and even they were crying!  but of course, they didn't listen to our server when she warned them, so they ordered it HOT anyway and boy, I saw grown men in tears!  A solid four stars for the taste, for the experience of getting down and dirty and for such great friendly service.  However, my two pounds of crawfish even with a side of Cajun fries (also spicy!) still left me craving for more substantial food.  The damage came up to $31 with tip which is pricey indeed but I guess this leaves room in your tummy for the after party!"}
{"text":"If I had to hear about how wonderful this place was one more time from people I knew I was going to scream. I decided to come here ordered the half pound of shrimp which is not very much hot and juicy style baby spice which made my nose run because it was so spicy. I got three potatoes in my meal, the flavor was good tons of garlic so beware bad date spot! Ordered a side of calamari for the table. It was around $12 and it came out in a tiny basket with one thing of sauce with about 12 pieces so $1 a piece and it was horrible! After we left everyone was still kind of hungry as it wasn't a lot of food but it's not cheap either. I honestly can think of a ton more places I would rather eat! I guess for the \" experience\"  it's good but to me not something I'll be adding to the top of my list by any means."}
{"text":"Fasten your Bib and Let's get Messy!  The best crawfish place outside of Louisiana that I have been to. Order your selection of seafood, I recommend a pound each of the crawfish and shrimp, pick your sauce, and enjoy?  Oh yeah, about plates? Who needs 'em! Your meal comes shaken up in the bag and thrown on the plastic tarp on your table. It's fun, messy eating from there on out!  I recommend getting the Louisiana Style, spicy. If you want a blend of all the sauces, go for the Hot n' Juicy."}
{"text":"Was visiting a friend in Henderson this weekend and we were headed to the Kabob Grill per his recommendation for lunch and I saw this place and got excited. I'm from the south and love me some crawfish and shrimp, fresh only of course. So when he said he has been meaning to try this place after I pointed it out we headed in and asked the important question. \"are your crawfish fresh and where are they from\".... we got a \"yes\" on the fresh part and a \"I don't know\" on the origin. Normally I only like Louisiana crawfish preferably non-farm raised....yes I know I'm a snob but when you grow up catching your own you learn a thing or two about your catch. We moved forward anyway. Since my buddy had never really had crawfish it was fun to show him how to eat them. 2lbs Hot and Juicy Mild Crawfish, 1lbs Hot and Juicy Mild Shrimp, and a Fried Catfish Basket for good measure because my buddy is a big eater and he was afraid that just the seafood would not be enough. Needless to say the table looked like a bone/shell yard when we were done. Which I always find amusing....  Now I am from So Cal so I am a regular at a place called the Boiling Crab which is a chain with the same concept as this one. They fly their seafood in from Louisiana daily and they typically have large crawfish. I'm not sure where this places supply comes from but the crawfish were mostly really small with a medium one here and there. And as everyone knows eating crawfish takes some labor. So small ones make the process of getting full a lot harder. Also becuase they were soo small it was easy to overcook them a little which normally makes their tail ( where all the meat is ) pop off. I felt bad for my buddy because he kept grabbing ones that were head with no tail. He spent the later portion of the meal digging through the bag to try and find all the missing tails..... The flavor was good, not as good as Boiling Crab. But it was worth trying. I typically don't like citrus in my crawfish and shrimp and the Hot and Juicy Special seasoning had some citrus flavor in it. So if you are like me I would go with the Juicy Cajun or Louisiana Style I think, not sure because didn't try it but it sounds closer to what I normally get back here. The spice levels are a little deceiving which is typical at places like this. We discussed this with the waitress and she acknowledged that the medium was on the hot side and so on and so on..... so the mild has enough kick to get you by without not allowing you to taste the meat. Of course if you are a pepper head then by all means....blow it up!  The catfish was different both my buddy and I agreed. Not necessarily bad but just ok. You could tell it was frozen and maybe had not been properly defrosted before it was fried. The Cajun fries were good, better than typical regular fries. All in all it was a good experience.  Oh also if you are not used to eating a lot of butter/oil (which most people aren't) this place will be a little heavy for you. They use alot of butter in their sauces. So if you are like me you just use these places as a treat from time to time. But hey if you can handle it everyday carry on carry on....."}
{"text":"Like i said in my check-in, we love H&J and this is our first time at this location. All the food was best ever. Our server Aubrey gave us really attentive and personable service. We will definitely come back next time in Vegas!"}
{"text":"The food was great. I wish the dining experience matched the quality of the food. Our server was Isaac (spell check). He took our orders & never came back. Other servers would periodically ask if we were ok or if we needed anything. I waited for my check for about 15 minutes after finishing my food bc our server didn't check on us & the others were busy. The server that brought our check & to go containers was great, although she wasn't our server. I think her name may have been Lis. I've been a server in the past for many years & have never given my guest as poor service as Isaac did. He spoke poorly of the restaurant and how \"the bar sucked\" so he was unable to make any drinks other than what was on the drink menu. For what I spent on dinner I felt Isaac was far less than deserving of a tip & had the receipt not been printed under him I would've tipped Lis. I did not tip Isaac for his extreme lack of service. I won't be back here due to the poor service. I'd be willing to try another location."}
{"text":"Here is the short and sweet, or rather I mean bitter because, food was good, but service was lacking. Sat there and waited after ordering for about an hour before our pounds of shrimp arrived, noticed other customers seated after us already recieving there orders, long before asking about our orders which promptly came after we had asked. And didn't even receive any apologies or explanation about the delay. Waiting that long for food makes you lose your appetite and leave a bad taste. Love hot and juicy, but will not be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"Awsome food!  Not a spicy kind of guy and our server, Jessica, was awesome!  She let me know what to order and my beer was always replaced at the right time!  Incredible service, good vibe, and amazing sea food!"}
{"text":"The food is fantastic here but it can get busy with a long wait depending on the time of day/week. But it's well worth it. Service pretty decent."}
{"text":"1. It's a split decision.  2. A little pricey. Good service. Food, fun but portion size was average for the shrimp, poor for the orders of fries and chicken wings.  3. Good spicy, hot sauces. 4. Wait time for groups, and automatic 18% tip added.  I suggest trying it once with a small group of individuals and go from there."}
{"text":"The food at this place rocks. Don't take a person here though if they don't like spicy food or making a mess when they eat. We made that mistake so one of the members of our party didn't eat. Also, the food is VERY messy but they give you a bib as protection.   All of the food is very spicy and very delicious. We got crawfish which I hadn't had before and there wasn't all that much meat. I also got the King Crab and that was awesome! The fried calamari was also good."}
{"text":"Ordered shrimp po' boys and cajun fries which were tasty and pretty quick. The music is WAAAAAYYYYYY too loud to make for an enjoyable atmosphere. Overall a decent experience but probably won't be back."}
{"text":"I absolutely love love this place. I was so excited when they finally open one right by my house!!! Even though its always busy, the staff always comes around making sure to see if we need anything else. Place is nice and clean. They even have a place for u to sit outside . I go here so much , either to get it togo or enjoying it there. Totally recommend this place!!!!"}
{"text":"I can only say one thing YUMMY!  I would give 5 stars if they were more helpful with the menu for us first timers but the food was great. Didn't think I would like it. But we do see ourselves going back."}
{"text":"Irene  and Sys great customer service ladies! Third time here. We're glad we came back. Yes we had an hour wait on a Friday afternoon but it's worth it.  Great experience for our out of town guests.  Can't go wrong with the shrimp,  hot & juicy, medium spice."}
{"text":"Wow!! This was one of my best meals I ever had! I got hot and juicy flavored crawfish with xtra spicy. And I also got sausage. They crawfish and sausage was out of this world! I wish I could still be eating this. It was fantastic. It gets messy but it is so worth it!"}
{"text":"This is the third time I've been too hot and juicy.... two out of three times I've had the worst service I've had at any restaurant in my life .... me and my girlfriend sat and waited for an hour before anyone checked on us.. The first time I came in as well I waited an hour before getting my food. I'm usually very nice and don't say much but this time I have to speak up."}
{"text":"We all know the struggle of craving crawfish in the winter/off-seasons. I was searching for a place to satisfy my cravings. I didn't have really high expectations with my order because I knew I'd be getting frozen crawfish but it was better than I expected. We got the Hot N Juicy sauce and it was the perfect balance of spices and garlic flavor. The service we received was great and all the staff members were very kind and helpful."}
{"text":"So my and my associate decided to go to hot and juicy for dinner.. Now let me tell you my last two experiences weren't the greatest but this time I have to say it worked out..  I ordered 2lbs of crawfish my associate ordered catfish a side of rice and a 1lb of shrimp.  My crawfish were tiny but the flavor was on point. My flavor was hot and juicy, spicy Cajun..  My associate stated their food was pretty good and I could agree because be time I looked up their food was gone before mine ((LOL)).   After its all done and over with I enjoyed my meal but would love to have bigger crawfish next time so I guess until than I'll keep hoping and wishing for thoses succulent suckers!!! Haha"}
{"text":"This is way different than this type of restaurant in the bay area but it really grew on me. The bags of dads or shrimp come out way drier and less buttery but were very addictive.   My companions and I really went to work. There was more slurping/sucking noises than conversating going on...good thing. I love me some shrimp brains. We also ordered a whole dungeness that was deelicious.   The crawdads looked a little beat up though, meaning the shells were cracked on a lot of dads like they had been roughly handled or crushed. Maybe a little less fresh than what I'm use to in the bay area.  Your hands are gonna smell like sea food for at least a full day but it's worth it. The heat had me waking up in the middle of the night a few times for a visit to Toto but this was expected.   I'd definitely come here again next time I'm in Vegas. It's a great meal that will get you away from the strip."}
{"text":"Sorry Boiling Crab, the workers at Hot N Juicy are hotter. Ahh, jk. Or am I? It's always a good vibe walking into this place. You're always greeted and taken care of immediately. Everyone is friendly!   My recent visit, I had Loren as my server. She was bubbly, vibrant and charismatic! The service she delivered to my family and I was exceptional and incomparable to any other near by competitors. One of my biggest pet peeve in a restaurant, is my water not being refilled. She was very attentive to our needs!   The food is always great here! Their lemon peppered shrimp is my favorite! Super tasty and their shrimp had a refined texture. Which was enjoyable to munch! Half a pound and a side rice filled me up. Overall, my visit was spectacular. On my next visit, I hope to have Loren as our server again! But if not, i'm sure everyone there delivers superb service!"}
{"text":"Every time I am in Vegas, I make sure to go here at least twice. Their combo sauce is a lot spicier than Boiling Crabs whole shabang."}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of different restaurants like Hot N Juicy and I will say that this one is hands down the best I've tried. Hot N Juicy is definitely HOT and Juicy.  I ordered my shrimp mild and it was still kinda spicy in my opinion.  A friend of mine who normally orders a \"10\" at Thai Restaurants ordered his medium and his head was sweating.    Our wait wasn't too long for a party of 9.  We waited for about 20 minutes to be seated then another 25 minutes or so for our food.  They were extremely busy but I'm glad that our server didn't forget us and made sure our food came out in a timely manner.   We had complimentary tasting of the which was really nice of them.  That held us over until our food arrived.  I was hungry.   Service:  Very nice and always came by to check up on us.   Food:  TIP: Pick a seasoning, Spice Level and your choice of craving. Ask for gloves Lime if you don't want to use gloves to kill the seafood smell on your fingers.  Overall, the food was really good and I would highly recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I had such a good time here with my friends. Damn. $1 beers on Sunday nights. What more could you ask for? It was lots of fun eating shrimp and crab out of a bag with the 'dozen' sausages my friend was afraid to order (it's really just 12 slices of sausage in the bag).  Don't miss out on the corn with it all. Did I mention the great service? They'll even put a bib on your chest so you don't make a mess of yourself!  Beware the hot and juicy with the extra spicy sauce. I didn't even have the balls to taste it. Bock Bock. That's why I order the medium or no spice. Ha ha."}
{"text":"Hot n juicy, messy n' delicious - I love this place!!  A bit ghetto shocking when you walk by the tables with their carnage of crawfish carcasses and other assorted shellfish!  We had so much fun here - ordering crawfish, snowcrab by the pound.    You pick your sauce and your spice level - you can even opt for a no spice.  Our waitress was a sweetheart, and even demonstrated to us how to peel a crawfish (it was my first time having them, and they are a lot of work!)    By far my favourite combination was Hot n' Juicy, mild spice snow crab - the meat is so sweet, tender and meaty.. you can remove an entire section and use it like a paintbrush with the juice.  SO GOOD!  Will be back each time I'm in town!!"}
{"text":"This was our first time here. However the concept is nothing new to us as everywhere in Dallas serves their seafood like this.   The service was good. The food was good. They could work out the flavor a little more. But again We've gone to a lot of restaurant like this so we have a lot to compare it to.   A lot of people visit this location because it's not far from the strip and it gives you the opportunity to get good seafood that's not super expensive.   One thing that was amazing was their crawfish. For them not to be in season they had some pretty darn good crawfish."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Katy Perry - Hot N Cold)  You serve your food In a bag, while it's warm Yeah your, crawfish spice (stings!) Like a bitch, I would know  And I over think Always order the dungeness I should know That you're so good for me.....  Cause you're HotNJuicy I'm Yum then I'm Ohh I'm in then I'm out I'm up then I'm down  A well respected establishment that has a reputation from Vegas to LA and now PHX!  I came with a couple of my gal pals since one of us attended Angry Crab about a month ago and was delighted. We ordered pretty much the simple things, 1lb of crawfish with the Hot N Juicy sauce at medium, oysters, dungeness crab, and some wings and cajun fries.  First off, I went for the oyster; definitely not the freshest, but hey we live in a desert! Then the crawfish; much larger than I'm used to so kudos on that.  The sauce is what makes the crawfish boil here.  I thought it grainy and thick and probably could be a little more watery.  The wings, well I had better else where since they were quite soggy. The cajun fries were good and crunchy and finally based on my friends take, the dungeness crab was pretty good. I'd say the sauce was okay at best, but nothing too WOW!  In the end, I guess I don't get the rave about these crawfish eateries, but can appreciate them. My overall service was excellent. The ambiance was tacky as most crawfish joints, but I would recommend a hand cleaning station outside the restrooms. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Crawfish season is here. Their hot and juicy medium is the best on the crawfish and shrimp. Couldn't take a picture of the food cause I was too busy eating. Took off a star for the 11.99 a lb. but I know it's early in the season. I hope it will go down."}
{"text":"The name of this place is funny, their food is tasty and if you dine in you'll reek of garlic :-)   We came to this Hot N Juicy Crawfish based on a Yelp search in China Town.  They have a lot of high rated reviews by locals and it was something different from where we usually when in Vegas.     Restaurant~ This place is busy with loads of people wearing plastic bibs and gloves eating bags of garlic immersed cooked crustaceans.  It's very open with plenty of seating for small or large groups of peeps.  One of the first things you notice when you walk in is the BLAST of garlic odor.  I normally love the smell of garlic, but this was too intense for me.    Service~ like a lot of places anymore! some of the people that work here are really friendly and seem very helpful and then there are a few that were not helpful at all and seem to treat us like number takers...  Maybe it's because they are so busy, but that's just an excuse.  I could care less man vs food dined here, which is what two of the servers told us and it's on their menu.  I'm looking for quality of taste and not quantity of food to conquer.    Food~ we had shrimp, clams and crawfish cooked in their juicy sauce which was very good but loads and loads of garlic...    This is an A-OK place especially if you're planning to do take out!  I recommend going when the crawfish are in season, order to go and share the good eats with some friends."}
{"text":"My friends didn't realize that there were two locations which are fairly close together and so what had happened was that one group ended up being at one location while the other was at another, funny story lol. Anyways, so we are in Vegas and heard that this place was similar to The Boiling Crab & Crab Hut so we decided to check it out!  Service: was kind, our waitress was helpful and attentive. Atmosphere: pretty spacious, had a good amount of seating, and it seems to be bigger than the other location next to Mr.Tofu.  Food: my bf & I shared 1 1/2lb of shrimp, mild, in hot n juicy sauce, fried catfish basket w/cajun fries, and two corn. Verdict?  Pro: The hot n juicy sauce has a nice kick to it & pretty flavorful and it was nicely smothered over the shrimp. The two half corn on the cob was nearly drenched into the sauce which made the corn sweet from its own juices yet hot/juicy from the sauce. I also got to try my friend's corn fritters because I was curious to see how it tasted and to my liking it was awesome. I like the creamy yet sweet texture that happens when the corn ball is dipped into the batter and then fried.   Eh: the \"cajun fries\" ... about them fries, it clearly wasn't cajun fries but merely fries with a splash of cajun seasoning over it. It was not the same... not what I imagined and had experienced at The Boiling Crab. Slightly disappointed, but at least the fries were not bad.   Con: From the outside the crust appears to be crunchy but when I bit into the crust of the fried catfish I was in awe. It doesn't appear to be crunchy but semi chewy or had an interesting texture to it. The catfish was okay not as fresh.   Overall, I didn't come here for the crawfish because I'm not really a big fan of that but I did enjoy some parts of my meal if not all. It was a good experience to try a new place but I think I have to stick to The Boiling Crab as still my favorite go to place for this type of meal."}
{"text":"hot n juicy seasoning crawfish.. it was crawfish heaven. different from the boils.. it was very flavourful and yum! i'd go back the next time i'm in vegas."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. It never disappoints. The service is always great and the food is always on point. This is a must every time I'm in the area. We always get the king crab legs and shrimp. Mix it up a little and get different seasonings every time you go. Never had to wait, but are always here before the lunch/dinner rush."}
{"text":"Great food at a reasonable price. Good, fast, friendly service. Could be made a bit more kid friendly by putting clips on the tablecloths so toddlers don't try to rip the plastic off...also maybe some crayons or something to keep them busy would be good. :) crawfish seasoning was great but they could have been just a bit larger..."}
{"text":"Five stars for the food! The seasoning is very tasty and the experience is awesome. Service lacks (server wouldn't shut up as in reading the menu to us and so annoying) but it's the food & experience you go for!! Hope this place does well!"}
{"text":"Hot n Juicy Crawfish never disappoints!!  This place is on point! Even though I am not a huge fan of the crawfish, (I have tried them and just not my thing to suck juice out of a head), the crab, corn, potatoes, and everything are delicious! You can't go wrong with the hot n juicy special seasoning because it is a combo of all of them. Me and the fiancé always make sure to bring out of town guests who love seafood here...they always satisfy!   If you don't know, now you know where to get some fresh, delectable seafood with a little bit of fun mixed in."}
{"text":"Always yummy!   Loreal was our server and she was very attentive and quick to assist with whatever nonsense we kept forgetting to order the first time around, not to mention the restaurant was fully packed.  Food was amazing as always .. The hot and juicy extra spicy clams to die for! I love getting the clams so I can suck up the extra sauce with every bite .. Lemon pepper shrimpies mild were large and very easy to peel. Green mussels were plentiful! The crawfish were a bit tiny but eh there were plenty of options at the table. We ordered almost 10lbs of seafood and it didn't dissapoint !  Oh! & can't forget those Cajun fries with a side of hot and juicy sauce . . . mouth watering!   Actually writing this review is only making me hungry again! Doe!"}
{"text":"The crab is finger licking good.  We had the lemon pepper crab, fried shrimp and sweet potato fries.  The crab had so much flavor and spice, I really wanted some more.  The fried shrimp was also good, I loved the breading.  I also got a side of potato and corn to go with the crab but I feel like that should come with the bag of crab already since it was so small.  It was like half a corn and a really small potato."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! My family and I come here quite often since we all love shrimp. Our favorite flavor are the lemon pepper and garlic butter. We usually just get it with baby spice, we feel that the more spicy it is, it takes away the flavor of the shrimp. We always order chicken wings too but on our last visit (1/31/15), they were way too salty.   Took one star off because of the service. The waitresses aren't very friendly unless there's a male at the table then all of a sudden, they're too friendly. Just because I don't have a penis doesn't mean I wouldn't appreciate good service. Hope all the men you ladies flirt with tip you well because all you will get from me is the minimum 20% tip and I usually tip 30-40% if I feel that it is earned. Oh well..."}
{"text":"AMAZING!   Hands down, the best meal during my trip! There's no way we would have found seafood this good on the strip at a reasonable price.   The dining experience is much different than what I'm use to. The food comes out in a double bag. One contains your food and the other can be used for your shells. If you want to throw your shells on the table, that's fine too! The table cloth is disposable :)  Another thing that was different was the order the food was served. The dishes came out as they were ready. So, some of us were drooling at each other's food while we waited for ours to come."}
{"text":"LOVED IT!  We asked our waitress to recommend a seasoning, since there were a few options. She recommended the lemon pepper, and I'm glad we followed her advice. We got both shrimp and crawfish, one with the hot 'n' juicy, and one with the lemon pepper.   The crawfish were incredible. The meat was sweet, with a bit of a floral fragrant aftertaste. I have a friend who swears by crawfish, but I didn't know why until now. We could also de-vein the crawfish just by tugging on the tail of the shell after breaking off the head. I had no idea that was possible, and call me odd but it added an element of fun to the experience. The shells were also thinner than I've previously experienced - I just wanted to crunch into them after carnally tearing off the heads. Talk about bringing out my inner beast.  They give you salt and pepper for dip, and also some lime/lemon. Tip from my boyfriend: instead of using just a sprinkling, ask for a ton of limes/lemons, and fill one of the little containers with the juice. Then, load it with the salt and pepper. It gives you a flavor option besides the spicy, buttery sauce, and kinda cuts through the grease. That way, you can endlessly rotate between pungent and rich, and citrusy sweet.  The waitress also wrote \"Thank You\" on our receipt. A great, friendly touch. I'll be coming back here whenever I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Give the place a try! You'll wait for your order! But it's worth it! The Spicy Sauce is delicious with the shrimp!!!!   The catfish and fries are great !!"}
{"text":"Got the sampler (can't remember the real name) with crawfish, shrimp and andouille sausage. Hot n Juicy mild. It was one of the nicest and messiest meals I've ever enjoyed. Loved every second of it. The place was nice and new. The service was fine. The prices were slightly high for me but not for the location it was in. Great concept, kind of different for a place so far away from an ocean, but nonetheless completely enjoyable."}
{"text":"Love this place but I am only giving it 3 stars because of an incident that happened here my friend took us out to dinner .They served our food in plastic pouches but they broke splashing us with the sauce. We didn't say anything but while they were cleaning up they accidentally poured sauce again in 2 jackets narrowly missing my friends very expensive  purse. We talked to her and she apologized and then she pretended like nothing happened.  After wanting to talk to the manager and waiting for a long time. They gave us a minimal discount and offered to pay for the dry cleaning. WE NEVER BOTHERED TO CALL THEM ABOUT THE JACKETS (."}
{"text":"I love hot n juicy! The first time i came here me and the bf were seated right away, unlike the 3+ hour waits at Boiling Crab in LA. The prices weren't at all bad and they are pretty quick service-wise. Their sauce is spicy even for the mild, but still finger licking good! I would rather choose Boiling crab's sauce over Hot N Juicy's, but overall Hot N juicy's got my vote. Faster seating, quick service, good prices, and FREE water?? Yeah of course i'd pick Hot N Juicy!   My only complaint about this place is that they kind of over cook the shrimp so it makes it a little harder to peel off the shell."}
{"text":"LEGIT  tastes, flavors, prices, service!!!  Etoufée was amazing and spicy, and the shrimp was very flavorful. Hot n juicy and Cajun spicing, and medium level will definitely bring in a kick, and will have you reaching for your water!  Man oh man--- the food is memorable here. Hit the spot after desert hiking and walking!"}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try Hot N Juicy for some time, and finally made it over. The experience was basically what I expected, complete with bucket, bibs, and butcher paper table tops.  It would have been nice to come with more people to share food, but I opted for the king crab legs, which were monstrous. The meat was excellent. I also ordered a side of rice and enjoyed the seafood juice/sauce with the rice and sausages.   I was able to try a sampler of the crawfish, and would have ordered more if I were not dining alone. I would probably order the live crawfish, though they were out that day and only had frozen.  Service was very friendly and attentive when I went, and the interior was as nautical as expected. Prices not cheap, but most of the seafood was sold by the pound and I think comparable to similar-type restaurants."}
{"text":"A review of this place by me is extremely overdue.  Honestly, I feared sharing this little desert jewel with everyone and they mama...but I guess when something's that good, word spreads like an LA wildfire.  Background: I'm from CA.  I've never been to Lousiana but I have been to Crawdaddy's (SJ, CA), Boiling Crab (SJ, CA) and Hot n Juicy.  My first experience eating cajun seafood was at Hot n Juicy about 4 years ago.  Ever since then, I became an instant fan.  I've located cajun seafood restaurants closer to my place of residence, hence Crawdaddy's and Boiling Crab.  Anyhow, by far, Hot n Juicy blows the other two out the water, HANDS DOWN!!  I just went to Hot n Juicy over the July 15th weekend and the ish was BOMB DIGGITY!!!  Their crawfish was huge.  Usually I think you get about 13-15 critters per lb, this time the crawfish were so big, we got about 8-9 per lb. But so worth it, I mean they were so big, I even ate the critters' claws...OMG! - tell me the last time you had a crawfish so big, you could eat their claws?  ** As some of you may be aware, I'm allergic to shell fish but DAMN, I make sure to bring my benadryl so I can grub out without having to break out in itchy hives.  That's how good Hot n Juicy is.    BTW, if you didn't know:  They have now added King Crab legs...man, I might die from OD'ing on shellfish that I know I really shouldn't be indulging in...GLUTTONY  For those of you looking to compare:  It has been a toss up between Boiling Crab in SJ, CA and Hot n Juicy.  After I got back from Las Vegas, I went to Boiling Crab to make sure I ate at both places within a short time span so as to keep flavors and experience fresh in my mind....well (drum roll please.....HOT n JUICY TAKES THE CAKE).  Hot n Juicy has at a minimum 2 more secret ingredients that BC doesn't have.  The intense spicy flavors are there at HnJ (Hot n Juicy special) without the thick oilyness that BC has in their Whole Shabang."}
{"text":"I ordered 2lbs shrimp, medium, extra juicy and a side of rice. The shrimp was extremely over cooked, to the point where it was mushy. I ate less than a pound before I told my bf I was done. It was just too mushy for me. The rice was also mushy, they used way too much water. Service was alright... We didn't get our limes and salt/pepper until I asked for it. The food took a while to come out. I prefer the Chinatown location, but the fact that this location is literally 2 mins away from me I can't complain. This venue is nicer, I love the open concept. They also have two sinks outside the bathroom, if you just needa wash your hands!   I gave 4 stars because it's still very new, and I have no doubts that they will improve!"}
{"text":"Wow, it was great. Service was nice and attentive,  but the showstopper was the food. The hot and juicy sauce on the shrimp is amazing. I Have decided that every time I go to Vegas, I will eat here."}
{"text":"All hands on deck! Channel your inner Filipino and partake in the spirit of \"kamayan,\" the traditional style of eating with your hands. That's right, utensils need not apply at this place. Forget your dinner etiquette and fancy silverware. Just simply suit up (with their fashionable plastic bib), bring your ten nimble digits, and dig right on in.   The breakdown:  Step one -- Choose your favorite crustacean or shellfish.  Step two -- Select your seasoning.  Step three -- Pick your poison (i.e., spicy level).  Shrimp is highly popular and worth it. My family and I shared a pound of each of these: Louisiana style, lemon pepper, garlic butter, and the hot n juicy special. We got them on the minimal scale of spice. The last two were my favorite, although it was hard to keep track once we started dumping them onto the communal sea of smorgasbord. Don't forget the rice.  My bf doesn't care much for seafood, so he had the chicken wings with cajun fries, lol. I was surprised they even had poultry... My family also ordered two pounds of king crab legs and a pound of mussels, along with two orders of their pork rinds as appetizers. (Yep, we feasted.) The cajun flavor on pork rind's pretty spicy, but good if you can handle it. Our waitress completely forgot and we didn't even get the rinds until we were practically finished. Service seemed jumbled when we went. Overall, for a party of six, we were all sufficiently stuffed.   Side note: Make sure to rub the lemon onto your hands and let it sit -- this will help alleviate the smell that sometimes will linger on your fingers for a day or two. You're welcome."}
{"text":"Was here on probably the best date of my life. The servers are friendly and the food is amazing. Thank you for the best seafood in Vegas."}
{"text":"I had never heard of this place when a friend invited me.  WOW!  The food was absolutely delicious.  We ordered Black and green mussels, shrimp, snow crab, king crab, calamari and added in corn, potatoes and sausage.  i'm a spice wimp, so I ordered the hot n juicy \"baby spice\".  It had a little kick, but the flavor was delicious.  My two children (12 & 14) loved it as well.  It's a little pricey however, it is worth every penny for the great food and service.  My favorite part is that it's so messy no one picked up their phone through the entire meal!  Thank you Hot n Juicy for a great meal and a great time!  And thank you Matt for the awesome service!  We will ask for your section EVERY time we come!"}
{"text":"I'm getting hot n juicy reminiscing about the shrimp in butter garlic sauce. When you're tempted, just remember that it's not socially acceptable to feast on shrimp on the full flight home."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night. Place was crowded and lively, but we didn't have to wait longer than 15 minutes.   2 lbs of shrimp 2lbs of crawfish Sweet potato fries 2 sides of rice and corn on the cob 4 beers  Total came to less than $80 bucks for 4 people. Not bad!  Key is to get the rice to catch that yummy, buttery, garlicky sauce!  Would definitely come back next time I'm in town...just not on a first date. ;)"}
{"text":"If you don't mind getting messy and stinky, this place is heaven. I once made the mistake of eating here on a lunch break from work. Bad idea. This is full body contact food! You have to be willing to dig in and get intimate with your bag o' stuff...whether it's crawfish or shrimp.  I love spicy food, but the mild sauce is plenty spicy. I can't imagine really going for a higher heat level. But the sauce is finger licking good. And if you're into making your own soup stock, take those tiny carcasses home and make some of the best seafood stock you've ever had.   This place is usually pretty empty and I wish I could get more people to go. Las Vegas needs wonderful delights like Hot n Juicy!"}
{"text":"Being from Texas where we eat mudbugs (crawfish) all summer I was utterly disappointed! They were tiny and not fresh. If your from Texas or Louisiana you will laugh at the size of these baby crawfish. I've seen crickets and grasshoppers bigger than this on my back patio! The service was great and friendly. I also tried the crab and it was not fresh and it was a 1.8 lb crab and there was very little meat the little meat I could get from the claws was so over steamed it was mush: the fries, potatoes and corn were ok. The shrimp was the best. It reminded me of a Joe's Crab Shack as for the quality of product. The tab was $78.00 and I definitely didn't feel it was $78 quality. I know others have given 5 stars but I'm from the south and I can only imagine this is the best they can get out here."}
{"text":"Amazing. Amazing. I would eat here every day if I could, honestly.   Prices are surprisingly reasonable if you order one of the combos. For a group of 4 we ordered the \"Get Your Feet Wet\" which has a pound of crawfish, a pound of shrimp, andouille sausage, potatoes, and corn for $30. Alongside that we also ordered an additional pound of crawfish and an order of cajun fries and we had more than enough food to go around. We ordered the combo in garlic butter and the additional pound of crawfish in hot n juicy flavor. The garlic butter is so good! Especially to dip the fries in or to suck the heads on the shrimp -- the only way to eat shrimp!! If you don't have much of a heat tolerance I'd recommend sticking to mild heat or lower because even the medium has a good kick.   We went pretty early, before the dinner rush and the service was quick and friendly. Our group was also all from Hawaii and local music was playing when we went in which we thought was really fun and nostalgic for us. Once prime dinner hours started they switched it off though. Sad faces because we were all really enjoying it!   Overall we had a great experience at this location and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I saw this spot on man v. food and thought I'd give it a try when i'm in town.  It smelled delicious when we walked in and reminded me of home.  I missed crawfish so much I made it a mission to visit this place.  They had a variety of flavors to choose from and there are other seafood items on the menu as well.  My favorite was the garlic butter crawfish I just wish I heeded the reviews and ordered the mild instead of the medium spicy.  I feel like I would've enjoyed the flavor more because it was burning my mouth.  Everything was good but because I'm from the south it doesn't quite compare.  I'd give this place 3 1/2 stars."}
{"text":"mhhh, so i didn't even know i got emails on yelp...........but I got an email from the manager at Hot N Juicy. That was very thoughtful of them to want to remedy the situation. She wanted to know the date of my visit and who my server was. I really don't remember at this point and to be honest I wouldn't want anyone to be fired because of it. It was very uncomfortable and worth mentioning to the staff just so they are vigilant of their customers water needs and heat tolerance but, again, it was so long ago. Hopefully no one gets seriously hurt and they use my review to train servers.   As I said in my response to the manager, I'm definitely not upset about what happened during my last visit and I would definitely go back over and over again. I would just be sure to keep the water coming because even if you love heat (as I do), it can get a little bit out of control if you dont have steady stream of refreshments to cool down."}
{"text":"I went to this place right after my flight and I loved it.  I got extra spicy crawfish and some medium shrimps.  Man, they don't lie... extra spicy is HOTT!  I was all red and my nose started to get runny but boy was it good.  Spicy + Beer = Heaven.  AFterburn was harsh but something about it was really addictive, kinda like crack.  I'm back in LA and craving it so badly.  By the end of  the bad, I was the crawfish peeling master.  Ohh the head juice after you twist the head off... yum!  Oh but make sure you don't eat the junk, well I didn't, just the juice!"}
{"text":"I stopped by this place because of the great reviews and I was craving seafood. The crawfish was about $10 a lb so I tried the crab instead .I had 2lbs of snow crab , 1corn and the Cajun calamari. The crab was perfectly seasoned along with the corn. It was finger licking good. The calamari was ok. It wasn't bad but I have had better. I will definitely recommend checking it out for the broiled seafood of you are in Vegas."}
{"text":"To be honest, I am a graduate of the Boiling Crab and amongst all the oc crawfish places, BC still reigns supreme!  But there is something to be said of the lemon pepper sauce here. Since this is my only las vegas experience I'm giving it a 4. With BC being a 5!  Come before 6 to avoid the lines!"}
{"text":"This place is not for everyone, but if you can handle ripping apart shellfish with your bare hands, you are in for an amazing treat.  I'm hesitant on such things myself, but once I managed to get past that, and get the meat out of the crawfish and muss it around in the amazing sauce, I was hooked.  The experience: it's a simple clean place.  You order some type of shellfish (crawfish, shrimp, crab), a type of sauce (I go with the hot & juicy special), and tell them what else you want thrown in... potatoes, corn, sausage (I recommend all three).  A few minutes later they bring out a big plastic bag filled with the goodies and they plop it on your table.  No plate, no utensils: just rip in and enjoy.  You're going to get messy, but they provide a bib and there's paper towel rolls at each table.  Make sure you do not neglect to get the sauce all over everything you put in your mouth.  I recommend washing it down with an ice cold Blue Moon.  They do also have fish & chips, and some pretty great chicken wings, so you don't have to get messy to enjoy a meal here.  But then you're kind of missing out on what makes it special.  I should mention that unless you like pain, you should order \"medium\".  Their \"spicy\" is truly hot, and not some watered down notion of \"spicy\".  My Korean relatives agree.  Their \"extra spicy\" is reserved only for the completely fearless.  Also, I recently have tried the Snow Crab -- very tasty and satisfying, with larger chunks of meat than you can get from a crawfish.  Good eating!  Again, if you're squeemish about this kind of thing, it might not be the place for you.  Also unlikely to go over well on a first date with it's enormous garlic content.  But it is unquestionably super delicious, and if you think you can handle it, you should definitely give it a shot."}
{"text":"Visited for a 6 person birthday dinner... Restaurant does not take reservations which always means there is a line out the door - no waiting area. After 1.5 hrs , our birthday boy really wanted to go, we were seated. Ordered shrimp crawfish and oysters plus corn fritters. Fritters were great. Oysters fine best part already opened. Shrimp best bang for money. Crawfish small . Bad taste leaving their calendars at the table .Restaurant is way over priced. I could see eating at this type of restaurant in Louisiana for the experience  but we will not be back in Henderson."}
{"text":"I passed this place by several times while enjoying my night on the strip and finally decided to stop in. The bartender, who was the best, helped me out when I told her the daiquiri I had with me from another bar was weak  and she added shots of whiskey to it for me. I was happy after that. Unfortunately I didn't try any of the food but plan to go back and check it out."}
{"text":"Great food w/ good service. There are several restaurants that are similar to this place, but I chose Hot N Juicy based on their menu. They had a few items that some of the similar places didn't offer and I was not disappointed.   We were able to get seated pretty quickly and our waitress was there as soon as we sat down. The food came out good and hot and it didn't take long to get it to our table once we ordered. Everything we ordered came out hot and delicious.   If you're wondering between Hot N Juicy and the other places, pick Hot N Juicy. You'll be glad that you did."}
{"text":"Freeking crazy good.. Get hot and juicy style hot.. Amazing flavor.  When we were there the crawfish were pretty small so if they are I would suggest staying away from them but still very good.  I think we ate 4 lb of shrimp which were so stinking good it just wasn't right.  The sausages were good too,  reminded me of bbq chips with some kick.  Don't miss this place when in Vegas"}
{"text":"Some people came here because of Man V Food. I came here because of Unique Eats. It's a little classier and actually focused on the food. Of course, it's in a strip mall in Chinatown and is now surrounded by copycats. This is the original and I thoroughly enjoyed myself.  Walked in and sat down at a plastic covered table. Met by a great waitress. The place itself was cool and a little divey (no, there is no lobster grabbing machine here). Ordered an Abita (#nola), a pound crawfish, a half of shrimp, corn, and rice on the side. Medium strength. I was deliciously on fire as I hoped to be.  Dudes and dudettes, I totally loved this place and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Food is fab. Service a little drab but Hot N Juicy \" you're my boy, Blue!\"  I highly recommend the HotNJuicy specialty sauce. It was so good, I wanted to insert a straw in the bottom of that bag where the food marinated! I think the food is priced very well and for the quality of the meats and seafood it was Perfect! Our table of 3, shared shrimp, snow carb, corn and sausage. We also enjoyed Coronas with our \"Spicy\" variety and there's just no other way to go about it.  I loved the vibe in the house! It was some serious down home cajun with a down home price! I'll be back even though we were ignored by the waitress for like EVER and they gave us ONE cracker to share! I can honestly care less about the deficit in their customer service because the food is just THAT GUUDD!   BTW, don't be ashamed if you wear the bib.  It's just to catch your drippings so you savor what almost died on your shirt. Waste not want not.  Girls, you'll be wearing Cajun perfume after that meal so boys don't take your first date from match.com there! SAve it for at least the third date.  ;-)"}
{"text":"I never have complaints at this place. Always nice n spicy.  Customer service is usually on point. In my opinion far better than the other guys. If you havent chevked them out please do. It is worth the coin."}
{"text":"First visit to Hot N Juicy, I'm not a huge fan of the whole seafood in a bag concept but the name sounded fun so thought we'd give it a shot. Stopped by for early dinner on a Thursday and ordered the crawfish, clams & shrimp. All with the 'spicy' sauce. The sauce was really good but there wasn't enough of it in the shrimp & crawfish so we ordered a side. The clams were awesome! I would definitely order them again! Everything else wasn't super impressive.   The service was weak. It took 15 minutes to get the side of sauce and we were almost finished eating by that time... The most annoying part was I ordered a second glass of wine but didn't get it until after we were completely finished eating and wanted the check. Why? Because 'no one knew how to open the bottle and they had to take it in back'. Really!? They could've brought it to me, I'd have had it open in 10 seconds.   Next time I'm feeling shrimp, I'll go to Casey's..."}
{"text":"Amazing.  I feel like ive been there 3 times in the span of a week amazing. The staff is friendly, the place is clean and the food is great  Im a country girl so I enjoy a plastic covered table where they have rolls of paper towels and bibs. Does it really get any better than that??  I have tried the garlic butter and the lemon pepper seasonings. Garlic butter is BOMB!!! Lemon pepper is delish just a little more on the salty side that is even too much for a salt lover like myself.  Also for hotness level mild is freakin hot. I dont like spicey foods so I thought mild would be ok.. NO.. no its not.. its like fire. So anything more is a risk you've got to be willing to take. Baby spice is pretty much no spice with is just fine with me. Go try everything twice then go again!"}
{"text":"As with any new restaurant location, there are going to be a few kinks. If you are ordering from the fried menu, be prepared to wait a while longer for your meal, even if other people in your party are ordering from the boiled menu. Apparently, even just after opening, there is an all-out run on the fryer. My meal did not arrive until well after the other people in my party. They had ordered the shrimp, which was overcooked but basked in the most delicious sauce I had ever tasted. I would give this location a few months to iron out the kinks.  I am returning, as the catfish was delicious, but not when I am under a time crunch. Maybe they need to invest in an additional fryer or prepare themselves more for when the doors open by having the fryers ready to go."}
{"text":"Always great food at Hot N Juicy!!! Seasoning is excellent! Snow crab with corn and potatoes. When you can eat a lot  add a half pound of shrimp. This is a must hit location when I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Walked into into nice ambiance. Headed straight to the bathroom that was all out of toilet covers & toilet papered floors. Ordered shrimp, cajun fries, & snow crab legs. Everything wasnt seasoned that great. Legs sauce was pretty good though.   Shrimp sauce was basically water. & the fries were nice and hot but not as cajun seasoned as I liked it. Service met regular service standards, nothing pleasing or over the top. And the bill/price was ok. Overall mediocre."}
{"text":"This place was incredible.  After reading about it we went straight there from the airport.  It did not disappoint.  Two of us had 2 lbs each of the snow crab, king crab and shrimp.  The lemon pepper sauce was delicious, the hot n juicy sauce even better.  Service was super attentive.  Only negative was they ran out of blue crab before we'd gotten there.  Next time for sure..."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the prawns, soft shell crab, and yam fries. I'd return. Excellent service."}
{"text":"Definitely not the best crawfish I've had but it did fill my craving.    I ordered the XXX spicy and the waitress was concerned because apparently it's too spicy for some.  The waitress made me a bit nervous but once the crawfish came out it wasn't that spicy.  Since my family is from Louisiana and I've had frequent crawfish boils I can tell when crawfish is uber spicy because my lips start to swell.  Hardly the case here.  Either way it's worth a try to fill the craving."}
{"text":"I visit Hot n Juicy every time I come to Vegas.  I like the newer location's ambiance, but they are both great.  The whole crab in that spicy sauce is the bomb!  They give you a bib and plastic gloves to eat it.  I didn't use the gloves and had the garlicky smell on my hands for awhile!  We mis-ordered and got a combo of crawfish and sausage, when we only meant to order crawfish.  The sausage was really good and were glad we tried it. Cold beer and spicy fresh seafood, it doesn't get any better."}
{"text":"Second time we've been here. Writing this as we eat. Very delicious and filling. Its packed but our waiter Christian is super sweet and attentive. Will definitely be back on our next visit to Vegas!"}
{"text":"OMG. This place was excellent. The food was sooooo good. However, I reeked of garlic the next 2 days. REEKED! I could smell it on my fingers for crying out loud! No bueno. That was one of only 2 things I didn't like. The other....no cocktails, just beer. But moving on........  The food was delicious. I mean, my crab legs were outstanding. I tasted my friends shrimp and WOW. I have really been put off by shrimp lately and it was just like my crablegs.....outstanding!!!!! I will absolutely be back.....just when I know I wont see people for at least 2 days!"}
{"text":"I can't understand why this place doesn't have an across the board five star review. A local friend of mine took me here for lunch so I wasn't really expecting anything. Wow. I had a pound of their snow crab legs (plus corn and potato) in their very spicy sauce. It was amazing.   The entire meal comes in a plastic bag, good thing I put on the bib! If I had a straw I would drink the rest of the sauce with it! If I had to complain about anything it would have to be that my very spicy sauce wasn't very spicy, actually pretty mild. I am going to assume I got the wrong sauce because I was told it was going to be overwhelming. The sauce was a perfect blend of sweet, spice, and buttery garlic goodness. The corn and potato were mixed right in with the rest of the meal (yes in the plastic bag), If I hadn't been with a local I wouldn't have know to order this.   I travel to Vegas often enough that this will definitely become my favorite place to go for lunch."}
{"text":"I really love this place cause they have fresh seafood and awesome seasoning, however, the service every time I'm coming here is really terrible. We asked table for 8, and they made us to sit outside cause they don't have enough table inside the restaurant. So how about the other side of restaurant that's nobody there? So ridiculous. The waitress spend 10 minutes to give us our drink, and took a lot of time whenever we asked for something, also, some of them served us with a not happy face, and I don't know why.  Since we love the food here, we still tipped 20% of the tips, but hopefully you guys would change the way of service."}
{"text":"Husband and I went twice on this trip to Vegas as we were there for a week.  Our first trip to H&J was a night visit.  Food, perfectly spicy, great service.  Everything great.  Yeah, a small wait, but yes, the food can be just that good so it was ok waiting.  The only disappointment that night were the 2 women that came in to eat.  One wearing a bikini top and one wearing a mesh dress with only a thong on underneath.  She sat down and all I could think was \"booty juice\"... YUK!!!  I know it's a very casual environment, but it's not the pool ladies!!!  I was thankful that the girl was told to put on a top before they would serve them the food.  I just wish the booty girl had to put on shorts or something.  Nasty.  Our 2nd time there, lunch... service was great.  We waited quite some time for the food though... it was odd... We ordered pretty much the same thing, but we certainly got ripped off on the crab legs... I know there was no way possible that we got 2lbs, thus the reason for the 4 star rating.  Yes, of course we'll go back, but only at night.  And, there is a GREAT massage place 2 doors down- yes, a legitimate one.  If you're looking for happy ending, then go to the one next door.  $50 for 90 minutes and it was great.  We had 2 that week.  Also, wonderful pedicure across the street.  Zen Foot is the name of massage place, pedicure is Nails for You."}
{"text":"Overall an enjoyable messy experience. Bibs, buckets, bags, gloves, paper table top.  Rating a 3 due to:  Customer service was not the greatest. We weren't greeted/welcomed, checked into let host know how many and were told to have a seat when it looked like multiple tables were available. A crowd of about 5-6 showed up shortly after and they apparently were really good friends with the hostess - she greeted them/was excited to see them/chatted with them/gave them all hugs and sat them right away (frustrating but we didn't say anything). We were seated about 10 minutes later. Never do I mind waiting but when you see open tables available or a crowd comes in after you and gets seated before you.. it's the little things.   It was some of our groups first time here (including myself) so we had questions and our waitress just didn't seem to care/annoyed to have to explain/answer questions I'm sure she gets her entire shift.  Prices are a bit steep but I do take into consideration quality crab, shrimp, and crawfish. All sides are additional (potatoes, rice, corn, sausage, etc.). Sauces are extremely flavorful."}
{"text":"Very flavorful seafood.  Crawfish and shrimp are great.  Their special sauce is full of garlic and spice.  I usually like spicy, but Medium is spicy for me at this restaurant, but a good burn.  Be sure to use double gloves so you don't get that hard to wash off spicy smell all night. The seafood is good, but it is all in the sauce in the bag they bring it out in.  We usually get the shrimp being the best bang for the buck.  It's good to have this kind of restaurant on this side of town."}
{"text":"Finally another crawfish place in AZ! I've had boiling crab from Cali and angry crab in AZ so I was excited to try this place because I never had the chance to while in Vegas! It has pros and cons Pros: the hot n juicy sauce is so good! The shrimp and black mussels are good as well! Only had a few mussels that were not opened which was good! Cons: service - sometimes it's good, sometimes it's not. Having different servers help can be good and bad.. Nice for extra help when u don't see your waiter, but sometimes it's a nightmare to and takes forever to get the bill and pay.  Also location, it's nice it's in Tempe, but the locations is horrible and the space is SMALL . Parking is a nightmare as well.   Overall I will go back again because it's all we have in Az.. But I will not go on a weekend or night! Only for lunch when it is not as busy and parking is a little easier.."}
{"text":"Five years in Vegas and I finally made my first trip to Hot N Juicy. I've been missing out all these years. The place is as good as everyone says it is. Great atmosphere and great food. King crabs and snow crabs were were meaty and delicious, the shrimp was big, and the crawfish weren't bad, although they were my least favorite because they required a lot of work for very little meat. Corn and corn fritters were excellent. We had to get another order of the fritters because they were so good.  Even on a Sunday night it was busy. We came here after go-karting at Pole Position and worked up an appetite but had to wait over half an hour to get a table. And, what's up with the TV reception? They've got some big flat screens but the picture was all static-y. Not that I cared to watch TV during dinner, but it just seemed odd.  My hands still wreaked of garlic the day after, but it was so worth it."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat out here in Arizona. The spicy cajun seasoning is to die for. I usually go hot n juicy or garlic butter baby spice, mainly because I'm a pansy but also because I can still taste the flavor of the food. I love that they have raw oysters on the half shell too! The snow crab and live crawfish (when they have it) is awesome too. Be prepared to work for your food tho, it can be a lot."}
{"text":"Much nicer and cleaner than the original location down the street and more space between tables. The food is just as good. Who doesn't love seafood in plastic bags? A friend and I shared half a dozen oysters, a pound of crawfish, a pound of shrimp, a pound of Alaskan king crab legs, and a pound+ of dungeness crab. We had no problem devouring all that. If price wasn't an issue we would have ordered more. Despite this chain's appearance of looking like a dive it isn't exactly cheap.   The king crab legs in the mild garlic butter sauce were the clear winners of the night. The dungeness crab was pretty tasty as well but required more work. I've never been much of a fan of crawfish. There's just too much work for so little meat. I'll stick to the other stuff next time."}
{"text":"Great place, good service , food delicious. Love it.  The decoration is super nice and friendly, no loud.  If you go after 5:00 pm is going to start been busy."}
{"text":"Good job hot and juicy. This time around we had excellent service. Matt and Sarah made sure that we were well taken care of and the food was amazing this time around. Nothing better than great service. My wife and myself are very satisfied and the kids had fun too. We will be back."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Vegas! Great quality seafood and delicious sauces and flavors! I'd highly recommend the lemon pepper sauce with the shrimp and getting crab legs with their famous hot and juicy sauce! Though I'd like to think I like spicy foods it turns out the mild on both of these is spicy enough for me ! Lots of kick in the best sense! Me and my boyfriend usually get a pound or pound and a half of shrimp and a pound of crab legs but when we are really going big we do two pounds of crab legs! A little pricey but so worth it and such a fun date place I love picking everything apart for the meat and getting messy and licking sauce of my fingers it's a great time"}
{"text":"My friends and I went the night before the Grand Opening. We were shocked by how spacious and big this place was compared to their original location. My friends told me Hot N Juicy took over the old Cajun Crawfish but made a few improvements to the space and decor. We were even more surprised by how good looking all the servers are. (We learned later on that a new reality show is going to start filming there so I assumed that's why they hired some hot-for-TV servers).  We went around 7 pm on a Friday night and it was pretty full but our group of 5 people and a baby were seated promptly. (A huge advantage over the original location.) We were tended to by a few different waitresses who were all very nice and tired a bib around each of our necks.   I ordered fried calamari for appetizer and a lb. of snow crab legs with garlic and butter sauce, medium level of spiciness. On that day, market price for snow crab legs was $16.99.  I had wanted Dungeness crab but they were all out. I got a side of rice and requested for lime and salt and pepper on the side. Everything was so flavorful and delicious! The medium heat was a little too hot for me and my lips were on fire but I still enjoyed every bite of my meal."}
{"text":"I'm used to The Boiling Crab in Los Angeles and was looking for a replacement here in Vegas...This place is a pretty decent alternative. We had the crawfish and shrimp with the Hot N Juicy Seasoning with medium spice level. The medium was a little mild for me and would recommend going for spicy if you want more kick. The crawfish was super fresh while shrimp wasn't as fresh but still tasted good. Compared to Boiling Crab, the seasoning had less garlic which is good or bad depending on what you like. The service was good, wait was not as long as BC, and they even give you the choice to use gloves in case you don't want your hands to stink for a week."}
{"text":"It took forever to get in then I found a rock in my shrimp. Not a good experience I wouldn't recommend it to anybody."}
{"text":"Great place. For the weekend in Vegas I ate here both Saturday and Sunday. I'm not to much of a crawfish fan so I usually go for the snow crab and shrimp. The sausage here is also really good. Way worth it."}
{"text":"We come here all the time but I'm after our experience here last night I don't think we'll be returning to this location. Our crab meat had nasty green stuff all over it and our service was horrible. We had to flag him down twice for everything we needed. I was constantly waving him down for water and he completely forgot my friends coke. It took him 20 minutes to bring us back our check after we handed him our cards. Horrible for the amount of money we spent."}
{"text":"Love this barebones concept. Seafood was excellent as well as the service. Wish they had a wash station like the LA LaBrea location."}
{"text":"First time at Hot N Juicy Crawfish.  Service was excellent. We tried a pound of Louisiana style crawfish and a pound of fried shrimp.  Both were very good although there's not a lot of meat on each crawfish and they are not easy to peel, so you are left wishing you had ordered more.  A fun and unique place to go with a group and the utter messiness of it all is mitigated with the plastic aprons and gloves that the restaurant provides.  I recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"Honestly I'm just really happy Tempe has something like this. The crawfish was mehhhh... But then again I wonder if crawfish are actually yummy... We got shrimps which were large and very spicy and a bunch of snow crab legs which were very good albeit very salty.  Everyone in our group had a great time eating with our hands. The calamari was some of the best I've had. Service was okay. One waiter left in the middle of taking our order to grab a check from another table (awkward) and another jumped into our conversation (like literally jumped from one table to ours. So awkward. And yes, I'm kind of a hater). Overall, good not great. Recommended if you're with a group of people in the area but not worth making a special trip for."}
{"text":"Be prepared to get down and dirty here!!!!!  This place was so yummy!! Maybe even TOO yummy.  Definitely ate more than my little tummy could handle.   Had the shrimp with potatoes and corn.  So tasty.  Our waitress was nice, our service was great. I enjoy these kinds of places.  And I am glad that there is one near where I live."}
{"text":"Ok food is great, unfortunately that would be the only reason for coming back. The service was bad with the server blaming the cook but items ordered was forgotten. I'm pretty sure management could give some extra training."}
{"text":"it was fresh. had some soft crab with cajun fries. service was fast and food delivery was quick. food taste better than boiling crab. only issue is that boiling crab give more in quantity. we ate at lee's sandwiches afterwards to fill us up after 5 people ate 3lbs of shrimp which felt like 2lbs shrimp and 1lb of dripping sauce."}
{"text":"Love the corn fritters here!!! Good Coke. Cajun fries are bomb. Po boy is good too! Smaller atmosphere. Not really any plates or silverware so pretty messy. But the seafood is good"}
{"text":"After attending the Stanley Cup game 1, VGK victory called for a celebratory dinner.  Since I have been wanting to each crawfish since my sister shared a pic of a pot of crawfish that she boiled, I told Earl I want to eat crawfish.  We arrived at H&J at 9pm and got seated immediately at one of the booths.  My toddler was in a great mood and was jabbering to the hostess and waitress, saying \"Go Knights Go\" and \"one apple juice please.\"  Unfortunately H&J doesn't have any kind of fruit juices so she opted for water.  I proceed to order 2Lbs of fresh crawfish in the H&J sauce medium.  Medium is quite spicy so by the end of it, my lips were very red.  This order of 2lb comes with a potato and corn.  We also ordered the chicken nugget basket for my toddler.  She ate 4 chicken nuggets and left all the fries behind.    Earl also got the Michelada and it was tasty.  Beer option was either Modelo or Corona.  This Michelda was for $5. So for our dinner, the bill was $42 pre-tip.  Was I satisfied?  Yes."}
{"text":"first off the food here isn't bad but I prefer Boiling Crab on Decatur. i've been there twice in the past month and have to say that the service is terrible. the waitress' perform as if this is their first job waitressing and are still learning. one was actually rude when taking my order cause she couldn't understand what i wanted. maybe i was being unclear but come on. I will just have to expect the poor service. this place is well over rated."}
{"text":"Talk about a feast! Come hungry, leave stuffed! There was a 20 minute wait (friday night, not bad) and there was a line of about 25 + people outside waiting to be seated. I ordered the Blue Crab, garlic-butter-was pleasantly surprised. Spice levels are about 10 notches higher than whatever you order so BEWARE. Prices are reasonable, food was good."}
{"text":"I normally don't give 5 stars unless it's really something to talk about it. Hot N Juicy was really good. The seafood, potatoes, and corn were seasoned well. My husband and I got 2 lbs of Snow Crab, 6 potatoes, and 2 corn on the cob with the Hot N Juicy seasoning (Medium). It was nice and spicy and I don't like very spicy but it was that kind of hot that was hot but so good that you didn't want to stop eating it. Next time I'll get baby spice or whatever it's called. Lol. The corn and potatoes were good as well. They brought it all in one bag and we shared it. Plenty of food for 2. The seasoning was so hot that I was picking the crab meat and the juice popped in my eyes! WWWOOOWW! Talk about my eyes were on fire !! So beware ... CAUTION * it's hot !!   Overall the food was good and I would comeback. Definitely a must try while in Vegas."}
{"text":"Called ahead and was told a 40-50 minute wait to seat six. Got there and they said 45 min. Ok, not everyone was there yet. Went to the bar, ordered a Jack and Coke. Sorry no Jack. In fact, only one brand of any liquor. Some cheap bourbon instead of Jack. First thing we noticed was there was no adult supervision in the place. Just a bunch of kids serving and seating. It took an hour and a half to get a table and it was a four top that they shoved five chairs and a high chair in front of. Sure glad our sixth person was a no show. Food was ok, eating out of a plastic bag with no plate, fork or knife was an adventure. Just not one I will be repeating soon or often. Not worth the effort. Should have left after an hour wait.  I know they are newly opened, but really an hour and a half. They could have seated us at 45 minutes had they shoved two tables together. But they were waiting for another large party to leave while the were seating parties if two and four.  Customer service is clearly not a priority here. Might try them again in a year or so, if they are still open."}
{"text":"The flavors and spices hit the spot in a great night in Vegas with family and friends.  We ordered almost 10 pounds of shrimp (3 different flavors) 5 pounds of clams, 5 pounds of crab, and a lot of other things on the menu. Everything tasted great and the services was fast after you place your order."}
{"text":"De-fricken-licious. I had never tried crawfish, but I'm a big seafood lover, so I was excited to try it from what is supposedly the best. You order your seafood of choice by the pound and can find the daily market prices on a board by the kitchen. You choose your choice of seasoning and heat level. I went with the Hot N Juicy special and \"less than mild.\" Even at less than mild, the spice level was making my nose run a little bit (I'll admit, I'm a wimp). Service was okay. We had to ask the waitress for a refill after she passed our empty cups several times. I promise, I'm not a snob, but as a waiter myself, if a customer has to remind me for a refill, I'm not exactly doing my job. Anyways, on to the food:  Snow crab w/ lemon pepper: Absolutely amazing. I don't know how, but their crab was some of the most moist I've had. Huge chunks were easy to pull out since the meat hadn't dried out. Don't forget to dip your crab meat in whatever seasoning you have. It takes it to the next level.  Crawfish w/ Hot N Juicy: Great, but very small. The little bits of meat that you get from each crawfish wasn't very much. As a crawfish newbie, I was surprised, but now I know what I'm in for. If you're here for just crawfish, I'd get at least 2 pounds.  Mussels: WOW. Some of the best I've had. I never knew mussels could be so tender! I'm so used to having them dried out/rubbery as they're generally - and unfortunately - cooked.  Sides: CORN! Get lots of corn with your seafood of choice. Shake it in the bag, so it gets coated with the seasoning and save it for whenever you're done with your seafood. It will be all sorts of juicy goodness. My only regret: not getting more. The fries and sweet potato fries were perfectly cooked, but beyond that, weren't anything special. Especially if you're trying to eat on a budget, I'd load up on some sides with your seafood, otherwise you'll easily be spending $25+ per person to fill up.  Chicken nuggets: As we had a non seafood eater, he got some chicken nuggets which were pretty bad. They looked and tasted like they came from some Foster Farms frozen bag. However, since this place is meant for seafood, I don't hold it against the restaurant."}
{"text":"First time to come to a place like this.  They served my pound of shrimp with hot n juicy sauce in a clear plastic bag and you have to peel it yourself.  Its soooo worth it. Had some rice with it, which was fresh sticky rice and some fresh corn on the cob which they put the spiciest sauce on it. Had some cajun calamari which is good but the shrimp was WOW. Amazing joint, will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Best server is Loren!!!!!  Love this place, the shrimp and crab hot n juicy special seaaon medium spice is the best for me!"}
{"text":"What can I say? I love Hot N Juciy! This restaurant is by far one of my favorite places to eat at. I am going to start off by saying all of their food choices are amazing, however, their shrimp is the best. I always get a pound of the Hot and Juicy special and not once have I been disappointed. Their sauces are fantastic, the garlic gives it a nice kick. The fact that you can actually interact with your food makes it an even better experience. The prices are great for the quality of food you get, so no complaints there. I must also say that their service is spectacular. All of their servers are very upbeat and always checked on their customers. I go there so much that they now recognize me. They are so much fun, I can safely say that this is one of the better places off-the-strip in terms of service. I highly recommend this place if you are looking for a high-quality cajun seafood place, just make sure to bring gum for that garlicky smell."}
{"text":"I love Sundays, besides being \"holy\". (I am a good girl). As usual, I have my Sunday treat but it was \"messy\" and \"kind-of-getting dirty\". I just had to have...aaah, crawfish.  I would say that is the closest I could get myself to transporting my state of mind in my good ole' neighborhood in the South. Since lived there, and having crawfish and alligator meat as Southern fare, crawfish became my last Sunday's dinner.   The smell of garlic, pepper and spice filled my nostrils upon entering. Windows brought in the early evening light as we walked in this cozy restaurant with its simple dining set-up. Rows of wooden chairs and white plastic-covered tables. Each table had a roll of paper towel. Television perched high up on one wall. Not much talking around, diners were busy....   Met by a smiling male waitstaff, and got a seat and table by the wall. Menu was simple in a rectangular paper. I knew what I liked. What else? but crawfish! I yearn for the days I would buy them from a seafood grocer in North Carolina and take it home to steam & boil it in my gigantic steamer-boiler pot. I am great at cooking crawfish. My kitchen has a rollaway spice rack filled with spices, stainless steel cookwares and stainless steel range-oven...I like making seafood and crawfish for myself and whenever I have guests.   But this time, this restaurant cooks it for me. Order the crawfish or  seafood by the pound..or two...or three...as much you like. Also indicate the type of spice and amount of spiciness. The waitstaff pleasant and helpful about anything unclear about the spiciness. If you care to ask about how to peel off the crawfish meat from the shell, the waitstaff will show you how. But I do know how, so let me say that I am hands-up, thumbs-up delighted when the crawfish I ordered came in a plastic bag inside a bucket. It was pulled out of the bucket and presented to me and my Mom. It was steaming Hot-and-Juicy! just like the restaurant is called. The aroma was invigoratingly intoxicating! But stop! one thing I just have to do. \"Cleanliness is next to Godliness\" so where else would I go before all this? The bathroom awaits for a good hands cleansing. Did that so fast! Yes, hands where the main activity going in this restaurant. Everyone was just eating away with hands! Diners were busy! By golly, this is a feastful of fun! The crawfish was extrasuperfantastically delicious! Well made, not too dry! There was sauce inside the plastic bag. Spicy, it was especially my request of Louisiana Hot and Spicy Special was definitely the spiciness it supposed to be, just like in the South! Small chunks of garlic and ginger were visible as part of the seasoning. Besides the crawfish, the oysters on their half-ed oyster shells (my favorite!) were large and fresh. With sprinkling of lemon juice and butter sauce gave it the \"to-die-for\" yumminess. Also, the crab legs (presented steaming in a plastic bag) was remarkably meaty. A side order of corn was drenched with garlic and butter with a little spiciness of Creole seasoning. Oh, corn-soft-ness!  Alas, this is a place for hands-on eating for juicy seafood! My Mom and I was delightfully full and messy. Yes, there were splashes of red on our bibs and table cover from the Creole-Cajun-Louisiana sauce but no cares. The table covers gets trashed by the waitstaff after each table is vacated. There's water in the bathroom, just go wash those hands! But will surely go back for more hot and juicy sea eats!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place, I have been coming for years, it is the best place for eating spicy food. Good price, excellent service, every one is friendly. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Every time I'm in Vegas I have to eat here at least once! And I had to bring my boyfriend since he's never been! The sea food is always so bomb! We loved it! Can't wait for the next time. We'll be back. Parking can be hard, but it's definitely worth the wait and the service is always great!"}
{"text":"*UPDATE... I don't know about ordering it with \"extra garlic\". Three of my friends told me I had garlic breath... next day, all day (more than 20 hours) and I brushed my teeth 5 times and chewed like 100 mints. The scary part is I didn't realize myself I had garlic breath at all... Embarrassing. Not doing this unless I know I stay home all day the next day.  Love coming here for take out! If I call in right before I leave my house, it's ready when I get there (15 min.). Smooth transaction. Never waited. I love spicy food and I'm not sensitive to any spicy food at all, so I ordered mine with \"Extra Spicy\" when I was there for the first time. I got major stomach ache 2 hours later. Be careful. If you are sensitive to spicy food, order \"Baby Spice\" not \"Mild\". If you are super super sensitive to spice, they can also make yours \"Completely Plain\". They just boil with Cajun flavor water and no sauce.  If you remember, I recommend bringing your own gloves (I buy them from Amazon.). The gloves they give you are thin and too big, they break easily while you are fighting with crabs or crawfish to eat.  If I don't have to see anybody next day, I order mine with \"Extra Garlic\" in it... It's very spicy (garlic wise) but I love it!! (Don't do if you have to see someone after or next day.)"}
{"text":"I don't understand the great reviews.  The food is sloppy and overpriced or in the case of the fried foods, greasy and tasteless. The serving staff was untrained and inattentive. Let me give you a few examples:  the server brought the food to our party of six, one meal at a time, separated over a ten minute period; the waitress omitted an entree in placing the order so that one member of our group got the 2nd half of his meal after everyone else had finished; when the snow crab orders came, they were served without utensils with which to open them.and requests had to be made to supply them.  The food creates a pile of debris that nobody offered to remove until they were asked to do so.   There's a difference between \"hip\" or trendy and this do-it-yourself and you're on your own concept.  They definitely earned the  description as a \"once-in-a-lifetime\" experience!"}
{"text":"My friends and I went here when we visited Vegas. The crabs were very flavorful and cooked correctly. My friend got shrimp and it was good as well, not greasy at all. I would definitely go back. Tip: If you stay on the strip, you will need to catch a taxi to get here, but it should be no more than 10-15 min (Vegas traffic contingent)."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat. I am a huge fan of spicy food and they have it. The bag of seafood, potato, sausage and corn is unbelievable! We go at least twice a month and love taking friends from out of town. This has been a favorite since they opened on Spring Mountain Road. You can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Came here after getting silly and drunk! I felt like Dexter during a kill, plastic everywhere to protect you from the splatter to come. The girls waiting on us were fun and helpful. Told us that the crawfish can come pretty spicy so order one down, so we got the mild (wimps we are).   We ordered beers and our crawfish were fun little buggers to eat, however it does come in a soupy bag, and the amount of garlic is nuts. My vampire husband got a little queasy, he doesn't handle garlic too well, next time he will try one of their other fun items. My breath was humming till the next morning, but I'm cool with that. I also got a cute tank top! If you come to Vegas often I would say you have to come here at least once."}
{"text":"First, it's def. not as great as the one in Orlando! Second, the service was good and on point. Third, unfortunately they were all out of crawfish while we were there during a Thursday lunch. They finally restocked on some while we were leaving! =\ I really wanted to like it but I didn't."}
{"text":"I'm a Californian and this place is equivalent to Boiling Crab. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Hot N Juicy Special comin right up!  I just came back from Las Vegas on a quick 23 hour trip and I managed to make it out to Hot N Juicy in Chinatown. My friends heard of it from Man vs. Food and I thought the pictures on Yelp looked promising, so it wasn't very hard to persuade me to go. We go there a little after it opened and were welcomed very excitedly by the staff. Of course, since we were there so early, we were seated right away. We ordered the calamari, two orders of sweet potato fries, a half-dozen raw oysters, two pounds of the Hot and Juicy crawfish, one pound of the lemon pepper crawfish and three pounds of the garlic butter crawfish (my personal favorite).   The calamari was fantastic, it wasn't overly breaded like some places do it. It comes with lemon and some marinara sauce. Now I am not a fan of sweet potato fries, but my friends ordered two orders, I was bound to try one. Not only did I try ONE, I tried like ELEVEN! Haha.. they were nicely seasoned and went perfectly with the ketchup. Believe it or not, I would order them again. (Zoinks?! lol). The raw oysters were so fresh it melted in my mouth. My only complaint is that I usually add a bit of soy sauce with the lemon wedge when I shoot raw oysters and all they had was lemon. But none the less, MELTS IN YOUR MOUTH GOODNESS!!! The guests of honor to our luncheon were the crawfish. All the flavors that we had were very flavorful and delicious in their own right. However, the garlic butter was my absolute favorite, and I think everyone elses' as well. Mainly because we put in an order for two MORE pounds after killin' just the one.   *BTW you can order different grades of spicyness for your food, however we ordered the Hot and Juicy special at just a mild grade of spicy juice and it was pretty intense. Even to my spicy-loving Thai mates that ate with me :).  I only gave them 4 stars because they only served beer. I'll add that additional star once they start selling wine at least, but with fingers-crossed they'll someday have a full bar."}
{"text":"It's sad, especially when you consider that Vegas is one of the best \"foodie\" places in the world, that you find a place like this where there is so much potential that is simply waisted.   The crayfish, at an appalling $11 per pound, are an absolute joke - pathetically tiny and completely overwhelmed by their signature \"Hot And Juicy\" sauce so much so that you can not even taste the minuscule portion you manage to pry from its tail. Don't even bother sucking out the head, you might as well just poke a hole in the bag they serve them to you in and drink away.   There are many things this place does that are very cool, and obviously people are coming in the doors, but one gets the impression that no one in management cares if you like their food or not."}
{"text":"This place was awesome. The location was a little dicey, but the food made it worth it. Tried the crawfish and shrimp.  The spicy was spicy. I love hot, and that was right at my breaking point. Don't come super hungry. It is a lot of work to eat the food because of the shell cracking etc.. Highly recommended! It is an unique experience. Will defiantly be back."}
{"text":"I love this place. I had been to one of these in Los Vegas. Pretty close. Good is delicious and in my opinion, better then Angry Crab. My only complaint is that the kitchen is a little out of order when delivering food. Some people at our table waiting 30 minutes after others at our table had received their food. That being said, the service was great (there was nothing our waiter could do about the kitchen). They also took care of us for the inconvenience. Will I be back? You bet. The food and service is just that good.   A pro tip: Get the corn, potatoes, and sausage with your meal. The seafood takes a bit to work on so the others will help. If you don't do it, you will be hungry.  Seasoning wise, go with the hot and juicy  Spice wise, go with spicy. If you like a little burn, it's not that bad. The medium just isn't enough spice of you like spice.   Do yourself a favor and give this place a try."}
{"text":"This was not my first rodeo at eating crawfish/crab legs. I came with my own arsenal. A crab pick and crab cracker, tucked in my purse. Didn't need my own because they had plenty. Have gotten burned by not carrying my own at other places.  The staff was helpful in choosing from the menu. I ordered a pound of Crawfish - Hot & Juicy Med, 1 Lb of King Crab Legs - Hot & Juicy Med, 1 piece of corn, plus one potato, two potato, three potato more.  What gives with the only one per order on the tiny baby potato?  A girls gotta eat. Why can't they fit two or three potatoes in the bowls? The Crawfish was presented in its bag of splendor. Waiting to burst out in all sorts of flavorful excitement. One whiff and you'll see what I'm talking about. Garlic, Garlic and more Garlic, with some other spice that is captivating. By the time if figured out that all the Crawfish was gone I was already elbow deep in the succulent juices. Then I attacked the King Crab Legs. They tasted frozen, thawed and reheated in the Hot & Juicy sauce. I called the wait staff over and let her know how the crab legs tasted. She asked if I wanted something else.  I asked how often they deliver the crab and she said every day.  I would not order them again I guess that's why Crawfish is in the name.  Well, I smelled of Garlic for a few days so you can't hide where you've been after eating here.  Dress casual, tie a bib on and enjoy. They won't disappoint with the Crawfish. Oh, and ask for a second bib for your lap. Stuff can drip on you if your not careful."}
{"text":"Went here with my fiancé after we got our marriage license from downtown. This is our favorite place and I can tell boy did we receive the worst service EVER! The waitresses were all over the place with all of the customers, it was about 9:15 when we got there so 45 minutes before closing and I had to get up get our own straws after I asked 2 times, I had to get up and get our own bibs and asked her 3 times for a bib, she brought mine and my fiancés food 15 minutes apart and to boot it took her 40 minutes to even bring my food out. The people behind us sat down 15 mins later and got there food 15 mins before us. I couldn't forget that they brought us potatoes that were hard as a rock I couldn't get anyone's attention so I walk up to the counter and the lady behind there is on the register and she was very rude telling me she was off but will take care of it and we never saw our new potatoes , by the time she came to us I asked about them she tells me I guess the waitress misunderstood you and our kitchen is closed. Over all food is pretty good service was terrible and I will never go back to this one. The ladies in there need help they were all over the place not just one all of them were. I saw them mess up 2 other tables orders it was an absolute mess. Hot n Juicy needs to hire more help and better servers plain and simple."}
{"text":"Old school, crawfish boil-style place!  We went there with some out of town friends who are serious about their crawfish, and they loved it.  There were only 4 of us, but (I can't believe I am admitting this, but.. )I think we ate our way through 7 pounds of crawfish.    Heed the warnings below, the spicy is REALLY SPICY.  For those of you who like spicy food, the medium spicy is a huge step down, but your tastebuds will thank you in the end."}
{"text":"Hot n juicy doesn't disappoint,  what's best? Consistency...That's rare in this town. No it's not fancy, but that's what I like, nice place to let loose with the fam. The customer service is decent, as the restaurant gets busy almost every night at around 8pm.  I recommend the soft shell crab basket and obviously the shrimp, spicy is the way to go!"}
{"text":"Stopped by on our way home from Vegas. The food was good, I actually like their sauce better than Boiling Crab (LA). However, the waitress def could not explain the spice levels to us, they way she talked about the food made me not order as much as I normally do. She basically said the Cajun fries are too hot, and to order the mild sauce because the medium is too hot for her. This was after I told her I like spicy foods. I def could of gone for the medium sauce, and I probably would of tries the Cajun fries if she didn't dissuade me from getting them. Not a great way to sell your product! Would of given then 4 Stars but they made one of my friend chicken wings instead of fried shrimp, it took foreeverrrr for it to get corrected and they still handed is a bill with the chicken wings (their mistake). Would go back but they need to work on their service."}
{"text":"Ughhh DANA IS EFFIN RUDE!  And needs to be retrained on customer service or she needs to be fired ASAP!  But the food is awesome! Just need better servers ! Kay thanks bye!"}
{"text":"I don't leave comments very often but Jay did an amazing job taking care of us (even though she didn't wanna finish my shrimp for me ;)) we moved away from Vegas but when we visit, we will always come back and visit this hot n juicy!! Give JAY A RAISE!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Vegas hands down!   Hot N Juicy is THAT place where I take all of my out of town relatives and treat them with a unique dining experience. Get pounds of each seafood in the hot n juicy sauce and you're good to go!   From the seafood in the bag to fried foods, this place will hit the spot. My favorites are the shrimp, crawfish, and fried catfish with either lemon pepper, juicy cajun, or hot n juicy sauce (Yes, I drizzle that sauce in the fried catfish too. So good!)  My server tonight was Loren. Love her! She was quick with getting our orders, our food, and she didn't leave us hangry."}
{"text":"Been to the spring mountain location many times && I have to say This Henderson location is awesome!!! If you like Crawfish look no further, Not only is the crawfish/crabs phenomenal the staff is Amazing. Valerie greeted us at the door super sweet girl, Myra our server was great as always she did very well of juggling both a few tables && Togo. Kelsey was also great she checked on us from time to time. All the girls was very friendly && personable. I love the fact that they work as a team && each staff member ensures your enjoying your meal! Customer service is a big thing to me && this location gets 5 stars :) Thanks Myra, Valerie && Kelsey for the laughs & good convo && thank you hot n juicy once more for not letting me down! See ya next week for lunch."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS! I've been about 20 times in the pass 5 months I've lived here. The Crawfish is so flavorful. Growing up in Louisiana this is def. A place I would bring my family. This place is better than boiling crab by all means. I think I may go tomorrow for lunch :)"}
{"text":"Foods great! Not salty at all and very flavorful! I enjoyed the environment here and the service was great. The food was juicy and the shrimp were huge! I remember seeing this on Man v. Food and passed by it a few times when we were in Vegas, but never really thought I'd stop by and eat. Since a friend of ours recommended it to us we decided to give it a try. No wait to be seated. Server kept coming by to check to see if we were ok even though it was getting busy... I'd give this place 5 stars. Great visit..."}
{"text":"Came here a few weeks ago with my family. Service was eckkk. They made us wait for half of our party to be present in order to seat us. Oysters were no good, they were fat, way toooo big, and no flavor.  Crayfish has decent flavor if you order the hot n juicy. Shrimp was delicious.   Reason why they are getting 2 stars is services from being to end was horrible. Eating spicy foods and having no beverages sucks. Waiters rarely came by to check up and you have to ask for re-fill as they were not attentive at all to their customers."}
{"text":"We always have a pleasant experience when Jared is our server. He is very energetic and full of life. Thanks for always making date night for LaBrea & Hans so great. See you soon."}
{"text":"Spicyyyyyy! But it was soooo good! I saw this place when I went to Nacho Daddy the day before and I'm glad I went back for this. It's like Boiling Crab but so much better!"}
{"text":"I instantly decided to try this place ever since I saw Man vs food on food network. We ordered 2lb of shrimps, 1lb of crawfish, and deep fried calamari. Everything we ordered was really flavorful, fresh and tasty. I love the \"hot and juicy\" sauce came with shrimps. It made me nonstop eating rice! I felt very guilty after eating so much carb. I think I will only shrimps next time because it's just not worth it to order craw fishes with not much meat in there. Overall, I think this is a fun place to eat with your hands and enjoy very tasty seafood."}
{"text":"I have not eaten this good in years!!! Ordered the pound of shrimp with corn and sausage. My wife and kids had shrimp and crab. We all finished it! Service was excellent! Never had all the waiters and waitresses always filling up our glasses with water or beverages that many times before. This is the best crab place we have ever been to. Don't leave Vegas without coming here. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"It isnt as busy on weekday night. This is the second time we visited this place. Definitely a better experience and the food did not disappoint.  Please don't be a newbie.. ROLL up your long-sleeves before digging in! I got too excited. Our server Giana was so kind enough to help me... because NO ONE in our table cared enough to help me (too BUSY eating??!)  The Dungeness Crab is Market Price (the market was high that night at 29.99 (approx 1.5 lb) for one BIG crab though.. I wished the stock market price was the same way!  Definitely cheap eats (AND better!) than at a fancy seafood place on the strip."}
{"text":"I usually go to the original spot because I always think the OG is better. Unfortunately, our taxi driver dropped us off at the wrong one. Since we were already here, we might as well try it. This was my parents' first time trying this spot so I wanted them to have a great time.   The spot was definitely more spacious than the original, which was good. Our greeter was very accommodating and sat as relatively quickly. Unfortunately, our server ended up being this tattooed chick, Cam. Bad luck. Right off the bat, she was not very friendly and seemed to rush us. Since it was my parents' first time, I wanted them to take their time to inspect the menu. I ended up ordering for all of us. She was rushing like she had somewhere else to go, even though the place wasn't too packed. The wait was not very long but things were missing. I constantly had to ask for things like crab crackers, missing orders, and she probably only refilled our drinks once. Our waitress was more concerned about hugging her friends that came in than doing her job. I had to ask servers from other tables for refills, additional orders, etc because when we wanted anything, Cam was nowhere to be found.   By the time we finished eating we were still missing rice and another order. I decided to cancel those because who knows when I would get them. I don't usually appreciate bad service, but I'm especially concerned when I'm trying to introduce my parents to a new place on their anniversary. The food was good but the service we received from Cam that day was horrible! Because of this, I will stick to going only to the original spot from now on. If my parents didn't enjoy the food I would've taken it down 2 more stars.  Hot n Juice = good Cam = horrible"}
{"text":"My stomach always hurts the next day after eating here. The food is so good but the spices do not agree with me yet I can't stay away. Parking is really bad. Employees are super nice and the restrooms are clean. Late lunch is an excellent time to come."}
{"text":"The Excellent:  * Nothing  The Good:  * at 4PM it was empty * The Hot 'N Juicy sauce was good  The Bad: * Crawdads were tiny, and didn't have much flavor other than the sauce they were drowned in (which was good, but the fish should have flavor also.) * The shrimp was disgusting. It was soggy, and tasted very bitter.   I came for the good reviews on yelp, but I won't be going back. I didn't even bother finishing my $30 dinner.   P.S. Parking sucks. Even at 4pm on a Monday. I can't imagine what it would be like on a busy night."}
{"text":"Hubby and I decided to try this place and it was super fun!  We ordered a pound of shrimp Hot & Juicy style with baby spice.  The waitress said their baby spice is equivalent to most places mild, and she was right.  We also tried the Cajun fries which were so spicy I couldn't eat them.  I don't mind a kick in my food but I was choking on how spicy they were, when I mentioned it, staff was super nice and gave us regular fries (no charge)!  We also ordered the soft shell crab Po Boy sandwich......yummy!  All servers are very attentive to your needs, drinks were constantly refilled, every time anyone walked by they glanced or asked if we were okay.  It was such a fun time wearing bibs and making a mess on the table peeling shrimp.  Prices are good, we will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"So after writing an average 3-star review for this place, a year ago, the manager contacted me and apologized for my experience and offered me a discount next time I came in! I was floored. I was not expecting that response--let alone A response, especially for a 3 star review.   Well, one year later (about a few weeks ago), I came in for dinner after overcoming my \"fear\" of shelling and decapitating shrimp and they still honored my discount! I had a delicious batch of seafood, sausages, potatoes, and corn with the hot n' juicy  seasoning and it was bliss. The service was phenomenal and the manager that evening, Eduardo, took excellent care of me to ensure I had a great experience this time.   The only thing I would add is that while their prices for food have predominantly stayed the same, the drink prices have significantly gone UP. That being said, this place still have great food and lots of flavor. Thanks for the good times (been back twice since then!) Hot N' Juicy"}
{"text":"Hot N juicy crawfish is my favorite place to eat shrimp at. My server Jo Anne was very attentive and provided friendly service. I definitely prefer this location over their other two stores."}
{"text":"Delicious seafood packed with spice flavors and some heat!!   Great staff and nice atmosphere!!  The location is right off the strip and walking distance from hotels!!"}
{"text":"Nice big open restaurant! Our server took great care of us even tho they were slammed I was impressed!!! Our food was good but the seasoning was off to me and half of my clam shells were empty ;( overall we had a good time and great service I will give them another try ;)"}
{"text":"This location is attached to the Miracle Mile shops, but now actually inside the mall.  The food was as delicious as we remembered, except the sauces seemed to be very sweet. The Hot n Juicy sauce and the garlic butter were way too sweet, unlike their other Las Vegas locations. I'm not sure if they changed their recipe or the chef added too much sugar by accident.  I love blue crab and they didn't have it. The girl who seated us didn't tell us, so I was disappointed to find out they didn't have it when I ordered. I thought it was weird that the hostess wouldn't just tell us they didn't have it when she seated us, but then I saw another table get seated and they were told right away. I wish they told us so I wouldn't have gotten my hopes up. So I guess my server wasn't as good as the other one."}
{"text":"This place is so good, I could eat here everyday. =]  This Decatur location had great food and great and friendly servers. It was my first time at this location because my family and I usually eat at the one down the street near Lee's Sandwiches and I'm happy to say that this place was waaaaayyy better. The one we always went to before always seemed to mess up or forget our order, evvveeryyyy time. This new find was right on.  I ordered a pound of shrimp in Lemon Pepper sauce, Baby Spice (because I'm a baby and can't handle spice lol) and we ended up getting an extra half a pound of shrimp for free (they were having a mardi gras special) which was a great surprise. The shrimp were large and juicy and just so yumyum good! We also ordered sweet potato fries and two cups of rice.  We also were given a Girls of Hot n Juicy calendar! Where certain Hot n Juicy female employees were dressed in classy cocktail dresses while holding different seafood. So creative and funny. Oh geez, I love it here lol =]"}
{"text":"Good crawfish place with a good number different foods to try. That includes Lobster, blue crab, shrimp, po boys, sweet potato fries, and last but not least (drum roll) ... Crawfish.  Interesting to have a price for Frozen crawfish and a price for fresh crawfish all by the pound.  I went there with a large group, and they were very accommodating. I particularly like the butter garlic sauce. It was a little salty a few hours later when I felt it, but overall a really tasty meal and good service."}
{"text":"This place did not disappoint! I got the 1/2 lbs of shrimp with the juicy Cajun medium sauce which was delicious! And a lbs of crawfish with the garlic butter medium, I wish they would bottle this sauce! I look forward to going back!"}
{"text":"I still prefer this location over their other locations. The servers are nicer & more knowledgeable about their items.   However, their tables are super close to each other where the next table is only inches away. You might as well sit at the same table! Haha! Parking is also pretty tight & full.  Nonetheless, their Hot n Juicy sauce & butter garlic are really good! I think the shrimp is worth the price, and the amount you get is sufficient. I wish they had deep fried oysters though!"}
{"text":"I have never been to a restaurant were you wear a bib and eat with your hand. This was definetly a place were wearing your finest cloths might not be a good idea. I ordered the hot n juicy special and it was really good. They hand you a plastic bag with your food and you chow down. I got the shrimp and I like the fact that you can order how many pounds you wanted. I would definetly recommend this to anyone that loves sea food and doesn't mind eating with their hand and getting messy."}
{"text":"This place is really good! So glad we got to try it while our here in Vegas. Very similar to Boiling Crab. I ordered a pound of shrimp, in the hot n juicy sauce; It is a little bit more spicy, though (I got the medium spice). My boyfriend ordered the same things, but in a mild spice, which was even still a little spicy for him. he also ordered the oysters and said that these were the best oysters he's ever had. The place was pretty busy, but the staff did a good job checking on everyone. Would definitely eat here again. It's worth the money to take a cab here!"}
{"text":"This is my second time at this new(er) location and I love that they have one on the strip bc it's so convenient! There wasn't any wait both times, so service was good. I order the same thing every time I'm in town which is a pound of shrimp and clams in the Hot n Juicy sauce at a mild level. Let me tell you that the mild is actually pretty spicy itself. I would compare it to most other Cajun seafood spots' medium. So if you're not big into spiciness, the mild spice may be good enough for you. Anyways, the seafood here always seems to be fresh and Cooke just right. If you're really hungry and can't wait long for your seafood, I would order the Cajun fries - they are so yummy!!"}
{"text":"if i were to die tomorrow, i would be down to have this as my last meal. the king crab legs are delicious. the oysters are fresh. the only thing i could complain about is service. the times i went it wasn't really THAT busy, but we needed to, for real, track our waitress down to refills.   my suggestion for going is to go early afternoon, and before 6 because after 7ish it gets packed, and there is a little bit of a wait. and make sure to come dressed pretty casual, and make plans to shower after cuz you're gonna smell."}
{"text":"i noticed that the prices went up. the oysters are always fresh. the shrimp and the spices are yummy and full of flavor. sometimes when i'm feeling extravagant i get the king crab legs. sometimes the king crab legs aren't always fresh and they're rubbery. but the shrimp and crawfish are on point.  sweet potato fries are the bomb as well as the corn soaked in the sauce. mm! but you'll smell like garlic for the next couple of days. that's not necessarily a bad thing though."}
{"text":"This was my first crawfish experience, and it was delicious! We got a pound of crawfish (medium spicy) and a dungeness crab (hot n juicy style). Great seasoning, good quality seafood, fair market prices. Since it's so popular, there is usually a wait at the door- we waited about 30 min. The wait staff is helpful & informative, but it's hard to hear due to the noise level in there- the music is great, tho a little loud. The food arrives in good time, but the staff was a little slow in keeping up with the drinks considering how spicy it is ;)  One thing to beware of- the parking lot gets crowded & often people park on Frontier street- when I returned to my car, the window was smashed :( So, park in that neighborhood at your own risk!"}
{"text":"Out of all the hot n juicy copycats nothing is quite like the original . Always get a lb of king crab and half lb of shrimp and some sausages . The hot N juicy special sauce medium is the way I get them buttered and seasoned . It's a messy sort of place but the food is great ."}
{"text":"YUMMY!  Yes, good thing for the bibs, becuase it will get messy, but it is well worth it! I recommend getting the hot and Juicy Special seasoning on your crawfish. awesome flavor.  We also tried the soft shell crab, that was also good.   We will definately return next time we are in Las Vegas.  Excellent service, great food."}
{"text":"Always so good! I order the butter garlic shrimp mild. Tasty! Wasn't over cooked. And our server melts our drink cups full"}
{"text":"Greatest seafood ever I absolutely love it,I have to have it every time I'm in Las Vegas even if it's Father's Day."}
{"text":"My co-workers love this place, or at least the original location.  So we came to check this new one out.  From the street you'd think it was a small place with a huge rush, but come in and it is vast!  Coming in right at noon meant no wait time for us and the waitresses was friendly and helpful with her focus on us.  So much so that when my bib fell off she put a new one on me (yes it was as ridiculous as it sounds, better work on my knots. -_-).  For this time I ordered the shrimp since I heard the crawfish was a bit of work and yes I'm lazy.  I ordered a pound of it with the Hot N'Juicy sauce, one piece of corn, and some sweet potato fries.  I'm definitely not one for getting my hands messy, but I managed to get over it enough because the shrimp was delicious.  Sucking up all that sauce was the highlight, especially on the corn.  It's definitely a once in a while thing for me eating like that but I'll be remiss if I don't at least try the crawfish once in the future."}
{"text":"The best tasting mess you could possibly get down with! I love it so much that i just keep ordering the same thing every time. They sell the seafood items by the pound (anywhere from $10-$15 lb) unless they're offering higher end fish such as lobster or dungeness crab which are usually a higher market price. They come in a large bag with the seasoning of your choice, the spice level of your choice as well as the option to add corn or red potatoes to be boiled in there. They also offer fried fish baskets such as catfish or shrimp, fries, poboy sandwhices and estouffe.   My go-to:  1lb Shrimp w/ Hot & Juicy Seasoning in Medium Spice Level  Fried Catfish Basket w/ Fries *TIP: Dip your catfish in your bagged sauce! SO GOOD! 1lb Mussels w/ Hot & Juicy Season in Mild Spice Level 1+ Corona Cerveza  *Be sure to ask for extra lemons and Salt/pepper mix for your food when it arrives! **Medium Spice: Not too spicy but enough to get your nose going toward the end ***Mild Spice: Really good if you're all about savory flavor (awesome for dipping fries in)  It's a really casual environment, they offer a bib and gloves. WEAR THE BIB! You basically eat out of the bag, crack and peel shells on the table in piles, use a million paper towels to maintain a decent grip on your beer... basically all right up my alley. The servers are all really nice, they're constantly walking through the tables so if you need anything any of them regardless of your waiter will take care of you.   WEEKEND ALERT: If you're planning to go around dinner time on a friday or saturday prepare for a little wait (15-30 minutes). I recommend making it a later dinner (8pm) or an early dinner (5:30pm). Otherwise they're pretty good about getting you seated promptly. There is also the bar which is about 8 seats at a high top bar that servers super quick."}
{"text":"It aint California's Boiling Crab but, it'll suffice.  I was hoping that it's spices or sauce would remind me of the shrimp trucks back home (like Boiling Crab's did) but, it was so-so. Maybe I'm just being to picky and expecting too much...? But, I wasn't blown away like I expected or hoped to be. Alas, I would mos def go back cause it's as close to Hawaii skrimp trucks as I can get right now =)  I'll tell ya this tho, when they say \"medium\" in spicy level...HOOOO, that bugga was HOT!!!!! I was glad I didn't request \"spicy.\" My bff loves spicy and she was SWEATING BULLETS eating her meal. I'm all for spicy but, I wanna taste my food...ya diiiiig!!?!"}
{"text":"Yum!!  This place was awesome.  Was staying at ph so it was super convenient to get to even though the location is sort of hidden.   Had the crawfish and crab legs.  So good.  Also got the soup thing and it was my favorite part of the meal.   Service was great.  The place was a nice authentic place."}
{"text":"WOWOWOWOWOWOW. Amazing experience. What a great way to have seafood. They have a table cloth of plastic and bring you these bags full of whatever you ordered. We got a big of mussels (great!) bag of blue crab (nice) bag of clams and a bag of prawns and some beers to wash it down. Service was a 10 and so was the food and ambience. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Love the shirmp!!! Lol amazing service. Long wait but I think it was worth it. Will stop by again..."}
{"text":"Everything was really good.  Sausage and shrimp was the best.  The spicy was a bit much for me but otherwise everything was yummy and would come back"}
{"text":"It's no Boiling Crab,  was disappointed.  Flavor wasn't that good, medium had no kick to it. Service was not great (they hustled and were friendly but in the chaos you get forgotten )"}
{"text":"Great custom service from our server Alexis, super good food, Didn't have to wait to be seated, overall excellent  experience."}
{"text":"First time I visited this place today.  I ordered a few pounds of crawfish.  The price was $14/lb. I asked the cashier are these fresh and he said yes.  So, I thought it was alright for the price that I paid.  When I went home to eat the crawfish, I noticed right away that these crawfish are frozen not fresh like I was told by cashier.  The reason I know is because these crawfish are mushy and not firm.  Also, I ate fresh and frozen crawfish many times before so I know if they are frozen or fresh.  These people think their customers are dumb and they can just lie to their face.  Very shady business.  Suffice it to say, this is my first and also my last going this place."}
{"text":"Good seafood I like all seafood easy style very funny I try to order Blue crab but now always out of season"}
{"text":"Great place to come check out when you're in vegas and not in the mood for the usual buffets or steak dinners that most hotels are serving up.  Price is reasonable too. I think it was $10 for a pound of shrimp and trust me you don't want more than a pound because its alot to go through.  Alot of flavor packed into these bags so I was impressed. Very busy but we didn't even have  to wait 2 minutes to get seating.  Gotta come check this place out."}
{"text":"I went with some friends.  They were very nice and homey.   We came on a Sunday, and as we sit there it was getting busy. They are very popular with the locals.  Looks like business is good"}
{"text":"We've been here several times but this is the first time it has disappointed us. We ordered the shrimp and the king crab legs...shrimp was over cooked and mushy and there were only 2 crab legs in the bag. There's no way those 2 crab legs weighed a pound!  Save your money and go somewhere else!!"}
{"text":"Great food loved the crab legs, shrimp and crawfish.  Lots of spices and Cruz our server was amazing.  Will be coming back."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Down n dirty is how you're gonna get if you come here. Fortunately they offer bibs and gloves! The staff is awesome everybody is so friendly and the food, I cannot express how juicy it is. The name really fits the food, get ready to crack open some legs and let the heat and juices flow! Amazing Louisiana style food as well. I've always wanted to come finally had the opportunity and nearly ordered the whole menu. Yes the food is priced reasonable as well. Special shout out to the shift lead Camille who even gave me samples of the food before even ordering. Everything was on point!"}
{"text":"My brothers lived in Louisiana for a few years and love crawfish. We have been going to Hot N Juicy for about 3 years now and tend to stick with the Tempe location as every visit we have had to the Glendale one has been horrible. Due to my sister living in Glendale we decided to go to this location for dinner. The food is good we always get the hot n juicy extra spicy shrimp with corn in the bag. It is a hit and miss with the sauce and a lot of the time they tend to overcook the shrimp. Unfortunately last night was one of those times, the shell was so stuck to the shrimp we struggled to peel every single one. The service is always bad at this location all the servers looked like they were in a bad mood. It look a long time to get our drinks refilled and even our check. We were ready for 25 minutes for the check but our server was never in sight. We will continue to go to the Tempe location. As pricey as the food is they should really put more effort into the service and making sure the shrimp is cooked properly as it is their specialty. Every time we go we always spend between $130-$250 for 4-6 people plus 20% tip. I would like to at least have an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"My first time to the second location and I must say that the interior designer did a great job! Very spacious atmosphere despite the entrance with its crowded parking lot.... I'm in a wheelchair so I got prime parking. =P    Went with a buddy who I havent seen since high school , his fiance and kid. Greeted warmly by the hostess and seated promptly .... This place gets packed fast so do what we did and arrive at 6pm or earlier. We went on saturday 07/02/11 a holiday weekend. All the waitresses were as the restaurant name says \"Hot n Juicy\" looking!! Not too shabby !!   we ordered ....  1 Catfish Tray  2 pounds crawfish 1 chicken tray 1 clams  2 orders of rice 1 etouffe 1 pound garlic butter shrimp  The Catfish was awesome ..... Lightly Breaded on top of a bed of fries.... Didnt have the fries coz I'm trying to watch my Girly Figure.... =P  I had the crawfish Louisiana style w mild spices..... Simply delicious!  Albert ( my buddy from high school ) had the etouffe and a crawfish medium spice in garlic butter.  I'm a Crawfish rookie ....loved the flavor ....didnt like the tiny reward for breaking open those lil bastards! Took a bite of the garlic butter shrimp and know what I'm ordering the Next time I come here!!  Just like a previous reviewer said  \"You know this place is bangin' when you're nose is drippin and you don't even know it.\" I was told by Lorena ( my buddies fiance) that I was sweating on my head..... I seriously didnt realize it!! The food is THAT GOOD!!  Definitely coming back for another round!! Great Place!!  OH!! I forgot to mention that our waitress brought us a bill from another table for only 20.00 ........ rather than a bill for 80.00 which it should be.... This was one of those What Would you Do kind of moments.... Just pay 20.00 ? or bring it to our waitresses attention..... We decided to bring it to our waitresses attention and she was so appreciative of that !! I would'nt feel right paying 20.00 for what we ate AND I would feel guilty knowing that the waitress would have to take a cut from her check for her error..... DO WHATS RIGHT PEOPLE!!  Do whats right!! nuff said....."}
{"text":"This place gets a crowd, and a big crowd at that. Since the latest competition, Boiling Crab, migrated towards the valley from Southern California we could see that the battle of the rivals are still in order. The question is, who serves the best shrimp?  I'll be brutally honest that my point of view is biased because i have yet to taste the savory goodness of Boiling Crab. So until I have tried its savory goodnes, my critic will rest at recommending Hot and Juicy until further notice.   Besides the raving hype that Adam Richman did feature Hot and Juicy on man V. Food, I can say that the feshness and the flavor of the seafood here are just to DIE FOR. Literally, you eat all the shrimp and crab you can consume until you fall face first first into a food coma (this my ideal way of leaving this earth).   I love the spice and tangy flavor of their famous Hot and Juicy sauce. My first mistake as a first timer is underestimating their love for HOT. So I got the hot flavor of the Hot and Juicy sauce. My mouth was literally burning with fire, and I couldn't enjoy the flavor of the sauce because the spice was taking over my taste buds. So if you are all for an inferno party in your mouth, I'd suggest the Hot  Hot and Juicy sauce.  My personal favorite is the less than mild Hot and Juicy sauce with all the right flavors with just the right amount of spice that I can handle baby! (ow ow!) Yes, it may not be on the menu, but there is a less than mild spice. The mild flavor still has a lot of kick in it so beware!   I also love the lemon pepper. If you love the tasty combination of citrus, tang, and spice, I would suggest the lemon pepper. It is also the safe zone. A flavor that is sure to satisfy you if you're not sure you're ready to take the risk and commitment of spice.  Lastly, this joint is worthy of five stars when you throw a corn in the cob and a potatoe in the plastic shake and bake bag (shake, DON't bake). Soak those bad boys up in that sauce baby, and call that a connection!   Its all about good food and experience and when you incorporate the thrill of eating off the table with no utensils or a plate (something your mother told you NEVER to do), you're sure to bring out the dangerous and adventurous side of yourself that you didn't know existed! Its a great place to take a date, especially if you want to test the daring side of them. I will be a long lived patron of Hot and Juicy. Hat tipped to you! :)  (Further update when I try my Boiling Crab experience....)"}
{"text":"I went for dinner with my friend, and oh so happens that they were filming for the cooking channel. I don't if that might have been part of the reason why service and food was extra special, but I was SAT-IS-FIED! My shrimp was ten times bigger that day, and the staff, although changing frequently from person to person, was very accommodating to our many needs. They were super busy, but they didn't hesitate to make runs back and forth for our lemon and pepper, and refills. Thanks hot and juicy!"}
{"text":"We had a great waitress who walked us through the ordering.   We had the hot and juicy seasoning with the mild spice.  Spice level was about all we could take.  So it was good.   Make sure that you wash your hands afterwards!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for the longest time! After many visits to las vegas, I finally was able to make the time to make a stop by Hot N' Juicy before heading home. Most people prefer Pho to cure their hangovers of course but I made it a point to try this before going back home this trip.  I was never a huge fan of Crawfish but I am definitely a fan now! I've tried Crawfish at Boiling Crab and it never stuck to me the way Hot & Juicys did. I usually order Shrimp but after trying Hot & Juicys Crawfish, I've gotten a whole new perspective of cajun food. Their Crawfish was flavorful, soft and melts in your mouth type of seafood. Definitely worth the extra hardwork to peel for those little things!  I did try their shrimp and I did not enjoy it very much. It seemed bland and the flavor was lacking. The shrimp just didn't seem as fresh as boiling crabs. I will just have to eat Crawfish at Hot N' Juicy from here on out but definitely worth it.  The service was good, they had a friendly staff and they were aware of their customers which I liked. 4/5 because it was great but the only downside was the Shrimp. Will be back for the Crawfish though!"}
{"text":"Of course I had to try out Hot N Juicy Crawfish (the name says it all), where the famous 'Man VS Food' Mr. Adam Richmond  had visited. We were greeted by a young lady at the door and she tells us the wait time is about 45 minutes  to an hour wait. So we decided to just place an order to go (we didn't want to bother with the wait). So we ordered 2 pounds of shrimp and 2 pounds of the crawfish. It took about 30 - 50 minutes for the cooks to finish with our order. So finally we made it home, we opened up the bags and I dig IN with full force!!! Wow, the shrimp and the crawfish was full of exploding spicy flavors. Here's a tip, spoon out some of the sauce and dip your crustacean in the sauce! Its delicious! So don't get afraid of getting your hands messy!"}
{"text":"Ok, I was going to give them a 1 star, but I decided against it.   I have been here a couple of times, and both times I wasn't impressed the crawfish were small and just really weren't that flavorful. I haven't tried anything else on the menu but I most likely will go elsewhere unless someone else is deciding and paying for it both.  On top of the above they are expensive for what you get, and when crawfish are in season Lola's is a much better choice."}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I went there for valentines day , they were busy but we waited anyways because we know its worth the wait , we have been there planty of times , and I think that night the host who taking name mess up because they were 2 parties who came after us , got sat first and we got sat at the same time with the party of two who put their name down when we were already waited for 45 mins , big regret on that night , the food always good"}
{"text":"OMG hot &&&& juicy!! we had the hot and juicy medium crab, galic medium crab, cajun medium shrimp, crawfish and cajun fries everything was super delicious.. and HOT!!!!  cajun fries are spicy... i love spicy but my friend who does not like spicey could not eat hers. so we ate them for her :)   cant wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I loved this place. I ate there 2 weeks ago and am still craving it. I would definitely recommend this place. Make sure to get the cajun fries with your order!"}
{"text":"Dining at Hot and Juicy was the best part of my Vegas trip. The food was SO delicious and tasted fresh and perfectly cooked. I wish there was a Hot and Juicy in Atlanta, Ga. I look forward to going to DC next month just to dine at the Falls Church location. Yum!"}
{"text":"Hot and Juicy is one of my favorite restaurants and when I travelled to Arizona, I was excited to find out that there was one there. My review is for the Tempe location.    I ordered the king crab legs and mussels in the hot and juicy special sauce. I was really disappointed because the crab legs were not fresh and they were overcooked.  The corn and potato came seperately in a styrofoam cup with sauce poured on. The waitress forgot to given me a bucket for my shells. Additionally, There was trash under my table from the previous dinner. It was not a pleasant experience.  I have been to the Hot and Juicy restaurants in Virginia, Las Vegas, Dc, and Arizona. The Las Vegas location is THE BEST hands down. They run that restaurant like a tight ship. The food is fresh and cooked perfectly, the staff is professional and attentive, and the restaurant is CLEAN.  The Arizona location definitely ruined my constant craving for hot and juicy and I won't be back."}
{"text":"Messy, but oh so worth it! Had king crab legs, snow crab legs, shrimp, mozz sticks, rice and Cajun fries.  Everything was amazing!"}
{"text":"I'm becoming a regular here, lol. There was a lot of people for Saturday night and I expected it. So, me and my friend went to the bar across the street (Zipps) for a few beers. I think they told us the wait was 45 min. to an hour so we thought we came back in time, but we didn't and our spot got taken. It wasn't a big deal because 5 min. later we got seated.   Ordered the usual crawfish, hot n juicy mix/spicy and then also got the half pound shrimp with the same seasoning mix with a side of rice. Everything tasted very good!!  Also, our server was Tiffany and she was awesome! Her customer service was very exceptional and wouldn't mind having her as my server next time I eat here!"}
{"text":"Awesome, awesome, awesome! Flavorfull beyond belief. Highly recommend the spicey crawfish and the catfish. I had to push the fries away to stop eating them!  Check this place out soon!!!!"}
{"text":"Had the crawfish / mild spice today. Not bad, left a weird after taste though. Management was horrible but our waitress Meesha totally rocked! After being ignored for a long time at our table, Meesha came to save the day with her sunny attitude. If it wasn't for her awesome cs, we probably would have had a terrible dining experience. Come here again? Probably not. Unique dining experience? Not really. Flavor was okay, crawfish were a really cute size too... If we were to ever eat here  again i would definitely order the shrimp instead.  Warning to the spice intolerant... Less than mild spice level is still spicy!"}
{"text":"The best shrimp I have ever had! Customer service was great. The calamari how ever was disappointing but the shrimp was amazing! Mild spicy was perfect."}
{"text":"Today was the first time I had gone to this restaurant. It was lunch time so we were seated immediately. My problem with the entire experience is although the food was fairly good it was so salty we could barely eat it. I've gad creole seasoning before but somebody went overboard ! Also it is supposed to come with one corn and one potato but we got neither until we were ready to check out. I prefer my meal to come out at the same time and I had to watch my mom almost finish her crab legs while I waited for my meal to come out. As I am writing this review, I am drinking tons of water to flush out all that salt!"}
{"text":"Had this place for the first time last month!! SOO GOOD you will not regret it! Its def more on the spicy side, so make sure you get your spice level at a point where you can enjoy your food. I got a pound of Shrimp with the Hot n Juicy seasoning at Mild spice level w/ potatoes and side of rice. It was amazing!!!! Def will be coming here again!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Boiling Crab in SJ.  Reasons why this place is better:  Wayyyyy less of a wait and it was on Man vs. Food.  Only issue really is that they only have 2 servers for the entire restaurant, so sometimes if they get busy it can be hard to get their attention.  Love the sauce, really flavorful and buttery.  Watch out, things will get messy but it's totally worth it."}
{"text":"Great service and amazing food! They were fast and friendly. Great environment and extremely family friendly."}
{"text":"My friend took us to this place off the strip.  He was really craving some Cajun-style seafood and he definitely knew of this place.  It's one of his favorites.  As for me, it's just A-OK.  They have really great service here.  Even though we were here with only half the party, they sat the first half and let us order first.  It took over 30 minutes for the other half of our party to arrive.  That was really accommodating.  I had some of the shrimp and corn with the hot'n'juicy seasonings.  It was good and what I expected out of this place.  Decently fresh seafood with some spices.  The things I don't like about these places are that they aren't environmentally friendly at all.  You're doing this picnic style with plastic bags, styrofoam cups, plastic utensils.  They even dole out rolls of paper towels.  I can't get behind that kind of restaurant or paying through the nose to de-shell my own seafood.  Still, the food is above decent and I always love me some good seafood."}
{"text":"We arrive with great expectations,  westgate has a seafood place! Cajun on top of that.  We order a catfish basket and a soft shell crab along with corn. The corn is listed as an appetizer but we asked it be brought with food. It arrives in a little cup soaking in a substance that may or may not be pure cooking oil. After about 45 minutes we ask if the food is being shipped from the ocean.  My catfish basket arrives. I have to share as the crab has yet to be delivered.   We wait about 10 minutes then ask about the crab. He checks on it and a short time later we have a steaming basket of chicken wings! WTF!  I ask to see the manager. She comes and tries to explain how things are cooked fresh and some take longer than others. So I ask if that means if we ordered four things if that means we have a four course meal since they will come about about 20 or morw minutes apart. She said that was correct. So if you go everyone should order the same so you can enjoy it together. Open the catfish, mostly raw. Crab was tasty. Will not be back!"}
{"text":"Good was great. HUGE shrimp. Very messy dinner but fun.  Service is super slow and hard to get what you need. In a timely manner. Total bummer."}
{"text":"This joint is packed 'til closing for a reason.  Crab, beer and sports.  Simple.  I will definitely stop by whenever I'm in Las Vegas.  Next time, I bring in the professional crab eating gloves."}
{"text":"Very attentive staff and the crawfish boil was one of the best I've had!! I got 3 pounds of crawfish all to myself. They were big, had lots of the yellow stuff (fat) in the head which means the crawlfish are nice and plump! I was surprised at how fresh the crawfish was! Out of the 3 pounds, I only found maybe 3 that tasted past it's prime like gutter/sewer. I got the juicy Cajun seasoning and because some of the fat got boiled out of the crawlfish, it made the seasoning extra juicy! The Cajun seasoning was a bit sweet so if you don't want the sugar then I suggest you just go with the regular old bay style seasoning. I got spice level 3 and wish I got spice level 2 because 3 had some kick to it. I choked a couple times and had to chug water when I accidentally sucked spicy juiced towards the back of my throat.   I think I even got a discount ($12/pound instead of $16) for getting 3 pounds. I got the andouille sausage added to my boil. They were super tasty!!  I also got corn fritters but I don't recommend them...there was more batter than corn. Ranch dressing as a dip was meh.  Service was on point though. They were bringing me everything from gloves to extra lemons and iced teas refills. I'm very pleased for such quality food and service found on the Strip!! Prices were not too outrageous either.  FYI, this location is outside the Miracle Miles shops. It's part of the mall but to get here you must exit the mall!"}
{"text":"Hot N Juicy should be renamed Slow N Sorry!!!!  They can't remember orders, they make excuses for their incompetence and worst of all, they over cook the seafood, which makes it come out slowly. How do you forget bringing 2 lbs of Crawfish when that is the main thing you advertise in your name?   They need to really re-think their business model and consider some professional leadership and server training.   Don't be surprised when you walk away disappointed, insulted and confused on why something so good can go so wrong."}
{"text":"This place is so good, but be ready to get messy! I had he snow crab with sausage and my girlfriend had the shrimp. Both were so delicious! Don't be afraid to get the spicier flavors they are so worth it. Also the price isn't that bad we both ate for about 35 bucks, considering it is seafood that is a good deal. Definitely check out this place if you're in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times in the past at this location and the food is usually good. My daughter took me here today for Mother's Day and it was horrible. The Hot N Juicy sauce which I normally get was sweet. It tasted like they added sugar to it. On top of that, they tried to charge us for food we didn't even have. I'm very disappointed in Hot N Juicy. We should have gone with our first choice...The Boiling Crab."}
{"text":"Everything is good here and I mean everythang. I'm  a seafood lover so I'm in heaven every visit. I'm not from vegas so every time  we're here hot n juicy is a must for me. Even tho its busy all the time trust me it's worth the wait and if a restaurant ain't busy then there's a red flag lol. Anyways if your in vegas definitely come out to hot n juicy there's more then one location and the food is exactly the same . The waitresses and hostess are so nice and friendly. I tried all the different sauce and all of it is great very flavorful.  Also like that they do 1/2 of shrimp."}
{"text":"I'm from out of town. My son took the family and I out. Yard house was 1 hour wait. Went to Hot n Juicy no wait  ( now I  know why ) got a table right away, everything's going well. They took our drink order. We asked if they had juice for the kids they said cranberry juice and orange juice we took cranberry juice. I got water with lemon one of us got iced tea another one got a beer. I ordered fried shrimp $12.99 with an order of fries for 399 my son and wife ordered a pound of crab to split and we got chicken nuggets for the kids to split we also ordered a side of rolls with butter. It seemed kind of funny they took our order with different waitresses they said we all work together don't worry about it I told my son I don't think this is going to work out. They brought the order my kids got the crab my grandkids got the chicken and I got the fried shrimp I told the lady I haven't gotten my price yet she said maybe they forgot let me go see if the order was put in I said if they haven't made them yet make him the cajun fries we have plenty of regular fries with the childrens chicken nuggets.  the waitress left the check on the fries and we realized we hadn't gotten our rules yet another waitress walked up and said is everything okay we should we haven't received our roles yet with butter she returned with the rules and no butter I said excuse me she said just a moment and then the other waitress walked up s*** is everything okay your fries are coming I said we haven't received the butter for the rolls she said did you ask for it I said three times she said I'll go check on it she came back with a bucket of melted butter and an order of regular fries I said we change the order to cajun fries she said let me check on that the other waitress came up I said why do we have melted butter that's all we have I said well I don't want rolls with melted butter she said will take that off your order sir I said no problem by then we were done eating they brought me the bill as I was looking at the bill they brought out another order of rolls and 2 orders of Cajun fries I said I don't want two orders of Cajun fries as a matter of fact now I don't want any cajun fries we're done eating we're leaving and we cancel the rules and never ordered another order so they took care of everything took everything off the bill that wasn't supposed to be there all we got charged for was the crab the fried shrimp the chicken nuggets 1 lemonade when I see one beer 1 cranberry juice by the way that cost $4.50 the beer only cost $4 total came to 80 dollars  2 kids split an order of chicken nuggets the adults in order of crab by the way it was about a quarter pound of crab or less and the rest we shall and guts 80 dollars food was mediocre service was terrible had a very bad experience did not enjoy my meal whatsoever"}
{"text":"Update from last year. I took some friends with me this time and everything was just as good...hot n juicy! We had a great time and eat ourselves silly! Everyone there seemed to be having a great time. Love it, love it, love it!   If you're a \"seafood pepper head\" try Hot & Juicy."}
{"text":"WOW! Vegas always surprises me with the great foods they have to offer.  Came here TWO times in one weekend because it was that awesome.  I'm a huge fan of Boiling Crab so I was excited that this was the same concept- and with NO WAIT.  For all those BC fans out there, you know this is a big deal.  Spicy levels are higher than the norm and ever so slightly pricier.  No big deal.  Service is awesome- we happened to be one in like 2 years to find a sea creature in one of our bags that looked similar to a cockroach, gross!!  They took the bags away, called the managers and confirmed it's just a sea creature that sometimes doesn't get filtered out.  Phew!  They recooked another order and comped ALL the shrimp at our table.  All we paid for was an order of fries, rice, and coke. Totally awesome business in my eyes!  4 stars only because the coveted 5 stars belongs to BC."}
{"text":"If you ever crave for shrimps , crawfish and crab legs , then this is the place to visit . Very delicious !"}
{"text":"Just had dinner here. Ordered the, Get Your Feet Wet Combo. it comes with 1lb. of crawfish, 1lb. of shrimp, 2 corn, 2 potato, and a dozen sausages all for $36. They only let you choose one flavor for the seafood as they are putting all of it in 1 bag. We picked the most popular flavor, hot n juicy in mild spiciness. We love the hot n juicy flavor it was really delicious, but the crawfish were so tiny and mushy! The shrimp was mushy and sticking to the shell. A warning from the waiter about the not fresh tiny crawfish would be great. Was not satisfied it had no crawfish taste! Feeling completely ripped off. Did not want to pay for it. Call in and ask what's crawfish size and freshness if you decide to come here. This place has so many good reviews wished it was that good for me. It's not so hot n juicy crawfish as it claims to be. Very dissatisfied."}
{"text":"There used to be no wait here but after Man V. Food highlighted this spot, the wait has gotten to be unbearable at times. I have heard they have another location now to ease the congestion of the crustacean mayhem.  The Hot n Juicy Special is the only way to go. I usually get the medium but be prepared to reach for those paper towels to wipe your running nose. It's spicy but not unbearable and the taste of the sauce is still recognized by your palette which I believe makes for a perfect balance. Make sure you get enough corn for each person or you better be ready for the ensuing fight that's going to break out.  My first and last stop every time I go to Vegas so you know it's that good."}
{"text":"This place is sooo good! I am obsessed with this place! Whenever I'm in town, I have to stop by here! They're hot n spicy VERY SPICY crawfish is sooo good! Along with their soft shell crab basket is good too!"}
{"text":"Marc was our server. He is super friendly but forgetful and messed up our order a few times.   We ordered Green mussels & he rang up a pound of black mussels. We told him and he apologized and said he'll bring the green ones right away. When the server brought us the next bag of mussel, the sticker on the bag indicates \"green mussel\" but again it was a bag of black mussels. Marc apologizes and said he'll \"take care\" of the mussels on our bill. But little did you know, when the bill came; we were still being charged for the \"black mussels\" we never ordered.  When I confronted him about being charged, he brushed me off. So we left and paid for the black mussels that we never ordered.   Moreover, we ordered a bowl of rice with our meal and our rice came way too early before anything else arrived.   We ordered a Modelo, and of course Marc forgets to ring in the order and has to be reminded."}
{"text":"The spice and flavor here are amazing on the fresh seafood! I tried the fried calamari,crawfish, shrimp,andouille sausage,crab legs,corn,and potatoes! I got medium spice and all 4 seasonings! Jasmine was my waitress and she was excellent as well! She was an expert on the menu and the seasonings and had patience with me since it was my first time there. Will definitely go again when I am back in Las Begas!"}
{"text":"When I first landed in Vegas, my cousin couldn't stop talking about this place. We are both from Chicago, so unfortunately, they do not have a location by us. He have tried this place tons of times before and since he hyped this place up so much, I had to try it myself.  The first day, we tried 2lbs of crawfish, crab legs, and shrimp. We also got the cajun fries, which is a good compliment to all those seafood. We got everything with the hot and juicy mild sauce because this was what my cousin recommended. Everything was so good, but I didn't really like the crawfish. They are small and requires more time to eat than the shrimp and crab legs. You also get very little out of the crawfish. I would not recommend this. The shrimp and crab legs are really good and the sauce was perfect!  The second time we came back here was a few days later. We came back with a bigger group and ordered a storm again. This time we only ordered shrimp, crab legs, and cajun fries again. Everything was once again perfect and I wanted to come back here again before we left back to Chicago. Sadly, this was my last time here and till this day, I would come here as my 1st stop after landing in Vegas. I also must say that after all this food, my gf and uncle threw up afterwards. Everyone else was fine though.  I also heard that this location is better than the other location, but I have never tried the other one yet. Also, for all you outsiders, prepare to get your hands dirty and do not wear a white shirt. It is messy and you eat with gloves and a bib."}
{"text":"Never thought that crawfish could taste this good.  The sauces they make are incredible. We even took some home with us.  Our waiter Jefrey was outstanding explaining the different kinds of sauces and letting us sample everything before ordering. Good friendly guy.  Would definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"Been there 4 times already and Hot n Juicy has not disappoint our family!!!! Awesome service by Myra and Trent and great seafood. We will definitely be back. Great job !!!'"}
{"text":"It was my first time trying Hot N Juicy! It was so good! We ordered the get your feet wet combo ( 1 lb of crawfish, 1 lb of shrimp, a dozen on andouille sausage, 2 corn and 2 potatoes), another dozen of andouille sausage, and sides of rice! We chose garlic butter sauce with medium heat ! Everything was so good, especially the sauce ! Don't be afraid to get your hands dirty and dig in !"}
{"text":"Well my experience here was awesome! My server did an excellent job providing me a Great customer service. The food is fresh and hot, place is very clean and spacious. Definitely worth a 5star! Keep it up."}
{"text":"After first seeing this place on Man Vs. Food I went down here to check it out.  Goddamn amazing flavor is the best way to describe it! There are so many different flavors and spice levels so anyone can enjoy some fresh seafood. The shrimp, craw-fish, etc are first cooked in a seasoning and then put into a plastic bag with ANOTHER flavor, a red potato, and a corn cob and tied up to steam as it it brought out to your table.  You sit at the table with a plastic bib and a large plastic table cloth and an endless supply of wet naps and swim in the juicy goodness that they have brought you.  They also have a small selection of cold beers to wash it all down with.  So come on down and enjoy so  piece of Thai/Creole goodness mixed together ;D"}
{"text":"I'm no stranger to hot n juicy been to this establishment more than once also frequented the Washington DC location as well as Virginia. I will say it's a hit or miss, great concept people love it but there's an art to steaming seafood in plastic bags with juices, they tend to keep cooking long after they've been removed from the steamer especially since they keep the bag tied.  When sitting in the back and when they bring it out to you.  That extra time cooking in its own juices tends to overcook the food, I ordered blue crab for 11.99 a pound that gets you 2 little crabs which is ridiculous they were totally mushy,snow crabs 18.99 a pound that gets you 1 cluster, I got a half pound shrimp which they serve with the heads on which makes them heavier they were borderline overcooked, I also paid $2 and change for a half dozen of sausages I received one sausage cut in 6 pieces lmfao the pieces were still attached. Meal cost me $51 for mushy food, it's not the first time I've experienced this but it most certainly will be the last."}
{"text":"My friends and I originally wanted to go to the Boiling Crab but it was between 30-40 mins wait....we were hungry though. So we looked up(thanks to yelp!) similar places tgat are nearby so we ended up at this restaurant. We waited for less than 10 minutes, and from the moment we walked in, all the staff were very friendly and welcoming. We ordered one lb of snow crab legs, 2 lbs of shrimp with different sauce each, corn cob, 1/2 lb sausages and plain rice. I had the crab in hot and spicy sauce, it was delicious! The shrimp in mild sauce had great flavor as well. Overall, the food is phenomenal, service is awesome, and the atmosphere is just happy and bursting with happy people enjoying their food. I gave it 4 stars because I wished they had a station intended for hand washing only."}
{"text":"Came here on Sunday, right when it opened... so there's no wait! At the beginning, the service was good until I guess they got more people and then our service was basically nonexistent... The water refill game was not on point. We had a party of 7 and our server was the guy with the man bun (forgot his name).  The food: Crawfish isn't in season so frozen crawfish is all they had. Fresh crawfish is normally $11.99 and frozen was $7.99 (which isn't that cheap IMO since i've had frozen crawfish at other places for $5.99). Two pounds of crawfish gives you free potato and corn. My friend ordered 2 pounds and added 6 sausages for $3. The sausages were sliced pretty thinly but they were decent.   I opted out for clams, spicy and hot n juicy style. I underestimated the spicy because I underestimate spicy at a lot of places. This place threw a good kick and I'm satisfied with the level of spice. My friends ordered the mild and the baby spice and they complained that they weren't mild enough or baby spice enough. My 1 lb of clams was $10.99 (market price at the time). I also ordered the cajun fries and made sure they were spicy. He says that the cajun fries are spicy by default. I was content with the fries while my baby spice and mild friends complained that they were spicy. The fries also had a nice kick to it.   My friend got a half dozen of oysters ($9.99). They were small and did not taste very fresh. They weren't the woooorst oysters I've ever had but they were far from being the best.   Final notes: Gloves and bibs are provided. Ask for salt, pepper and lime for a good dipping sauce. The table is able to be split amongst 3 tabs and each tab can be split amongst different forms of payment.   Overall, I haven't tried the Boiling Crab in Vegas yet but I'm pretty content with the Hot N Juicy location in Vegas. The ones I've tried in California weren't the greatest."}
{"text":"I came here bc of ADAM RICHMAN.  Adam's been pretty spot on on some of his food tasting adventures. Theres this one fried catfish locale in OK that was GREAT. Ike's in SF was amazing. so of course I had to go try his places in vegas.   I've only ever had fried crawfish before in tn, so this was my first live crawfish place. Everybody said the spiciness was spicy, and as a non spicy eater, I took the mild (a little bit spicy). However, it wasn't spicy to me at all. so i think everything is a lil overhyped. The crawfish was Good! It was dfeinitely an experience. they give you these cute little bibs to put on, and the crawfish come out in a plastic bag for each customer. You order by the lb, and 1 lb/per customer is definitely enough. On the other hand, the CORN is great!!! omg i love the corn that comes in with the bag. its really great.   I only give it 4/5 stars bc the crawfish were good, but not AMAZING. I will have to say adam richman, this was a bit of a disappointment but I think I went in with super high expectations. (i also like everything fried, literally everything i eat i love it fried, so the fact that it wasn't fried i think deducted 0.5 stars)  But in the end, its a good place! i would definitely recommend. I've been to new orleans before and had authentic seafood there, and it had a very similar authentic taste.  (Also surprised at the cheapness of the bill)"}
{"text":"Loved the boiled shrimp. The king crab legs were great. Pleasant atmosphere with cheerful and up beat staff. Prices were a little higher than expected but other than that, everything was great."}
{"text":"This is a absolute MUST STOP anytime we come to Vegas! There's also another location in Los Angeles that we go to if headed that way.  From the moment we step into this restaurant our mouths immediately start to water and we already know to strap on our seat belts for our cruise through flavortown.   If we're feeling extra hungry, we'll order the Cajun fries as a appetizer. They have a nice kick to them. Great flavor.   Now let's get to the deliciousness. Everytime I go, I order at least 1lb of the shrimp with the hot and juicy seasoning (ordered lemon pepper before, good but not as great) I like good spice but I don't like it to overwhelm the flavor so I'll usually get the mild but sometimes get the medium spice level. Either way I always order a side of the extra hot sauce on the side. The extra hot in my opinion has better flavor, but it's tooo much to handle if I order with the shrimp. So I get it on the side so I could control the spice levels I'm eating. I love this place so much that even if I had bad service (I never do) I wouldn't care because that's how phenomenal the food is.  I can't speak for the other shelled fish options but every time I've gone the shrimp have been big and the portions were great. This will definitely leave your mouth watering and coming back for more!"}
{"text":"I had wanted to try this place for some time. I had family in town and decided it was the perfect opportunity to check it out and I am so glad we did. The staff was wonderful about explaining the process, the different flavors and spice levels and even showed me how to peel a prawn! We we're a group of three very hungry adults.  We tried just about everything on the menu and just about every sauce.  We had zero complaints! This is the kind of place that utensils are not needed and you should expect to get messy! Plastic bibs and a roll of paper towels are provided. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I have to say I am a bigger fan of Crawdaddy's in San Jose, CA than I am of this place - both the service and the food (well, the sauce) is better at Crawdaddy's.  We ordered a pound of crawfish, a pound of shrimp, two corns and cajun fries. We ordered both the crawfish and shrimp with the Hot N Juicy special sauce which is supposed to be a combination of all of the sauces - the crawfish came out with that sauce and luckily they made a mistake and our shrimp came out with just the garlic butter sauce.  I was not feeling the Hot N Juicy sauce - it tasted weird with the garlic butter, lemon pepper and whatever else was in there, it was just too much. The garlic butter that was on the shrimp was really good though, we got medium spice and there were some nice chunks of garlic which is my favorite part :) Both the shrimp and crawfish were big - no tiny suckers here which I did appreciate because when you get a tiny crawfish it's quite annoying - all that work for nothing. My favorite part is always the corn because they sit it in the bag with the shrimp and it soaks up all the juice and every bite you get the sweet corn with the spicy garlic buttery taste - ABSOLUTELY AMAZING I'll tell ya! I think if we never got the Hot N Juicy sauce I would have liked the crawfish better.  The service was okay - we got some jock looking like dude.  He was nice but we had asked for extra sauce and some extra corns - waited about 10 minutes, didn't see the guy and when we finally spotted him he was just kicking it behind the counter chatting it up with the girls. In my head I'm thinking \"COME ON FOOL!  I WANT MY CORN AND EXTRA SAUCE! WTF YOU TALKING FOR?! THAT WON'T GET YOU A GOOD TIP!\" haha.. we didn't end up getting our corn until the end of our meal along with the check - I guess we could just call that our dessert ;)  Thanks to MVF we came, we saw and we tried some pretty good food but I think if were in Vegas again we wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"I will never stop loving Hot N Juicy! I used to be a big fan of Boiling Crab and I had only eaten at Hot N Juicy once before so I could not tell the difference between flavors. A good friend of mine raved on about Hot N Juicy so I finally gave it another shot and ever since then, I'm here at least every month. I did try Boiling Crab again a few months back and now I really taste the difference. Hot N Juicy is just so much more flavorful and I find myself craving it frequently.  I don't have a bad thing to say about service here. The waiters/waitresses are usually very nice and there isn't usually a long wait for the food. But if you come here for dinner it usually gets pretty busy and parking gets frustrating.  I usually order 1 lb of shrimp, Hot N Juicy mild or medium with a side of rice. The Hot N Juicy sauce is a combination of all of the sauces and is so freaking delicious. I like to pour a little bit of the sauce over my rice and squeeze a few lemons. I have tried some of their other menu items such as their crab legs, oysters and fried shrimp basket and all are delicious but I always just go straight for the 1lb of shrimp.  Always gonna come back here :)"}
{"text":"Hot n juicy. Sounds like a hooker on the streets but it ain't a cheap one. Let me tell you, I was not very impressed with this place. I've been to many similar styled places and me hearing people hype up this place got me excited but it was a disappointment. A heart breaker.  The only PROS: Most standard crab and crawfish places that do the Louisiana boil style have a standard of 4 sauces. (Cajun, lemon pepper, garlic butter, and all 3 mixed) but this place had 5. Also the spice levels can range from baby spice to extra spicy.   When you go to these type of places.. you have to get their signature sauce which for this place was hot n juicy sauce. It was OK. We got it for all our items (shrimp,crawfish, and mussels). It was a little too pastey tasting. I also didn't like the fact that the crawfish was frozen crawfish. Yeah they were alive at one point ...but there's a big difference in the taste. It definitely killed the vibe for the sauce they have. Also, I felt the medium spice was more spicy than medium. Most places I've been to I've been able to handle the spice but this was just berserk.   When you get your order it comes in a seafood bag. Whether you eat it for here or to go. Pricing is pretty hefty, but hey it's Vegas!!"}
{"text":"I always get the snow crab legs in a spicy lemon pepper sauce. Sooooo good. I can't get enough. If I could eat this every day I definitely would. Only thing I won't get here is shrimp; the past few times I ordered it, there was blood still in the middle. Mussels and clams are also very good!"}
{"text":"Not bad at all.  The crawfish was meatier than a similar one in California.  The blue crab was also good.  The shrimp pieces were nice and big.  What I like about this place is that it has good seasoning to choose from such as lemon pepper, house special, cajun style, and one other I can't remember.  They give you a piece of corn and a potato for ordering a 2lb bag of crawfish.  The cajun fries are good, but you can get similar tasting fries at a lot of places.  The medium spiciness has some kick to it.  They have actually five levels of spiciness which is ridiculous unless you're a hardcore fan of spicy food.  The service was good, but maybe it was because I went for lunch at a non-busy time.  The prices are just a dollar more than California, but it's still worth it."}
{"text":"I was recommended to come here by one of my foodie friends. First of all they give you bibs, super cute ! I tried the crawfish, shrimp, and snow crab and lets just say I will definitely be coming back.  The service was awesome, my server David game me great recommendations and had a great smile!! Ask for his section if you decide to come eat here :-) !! Five stars !!"}
{"text":"The etouffee was good as were the chicken wings.  Some of the shrimp was rubbery."}
{"text":"We had a group of 11 last night at 5:30, the restaurant was close to empty when we arrived. Even still- service was super slow and some of our groups food Never even made it out. I had to get up, halfway through eating and search for a manager (no one offered to stop by) since my friends food still hadn't arrived. I finally found a \"team lead\" and she worked on getting some of our food out and only offered 10% off our meal. Nothing more. Like I said, some of my party never received food. We won't be back. I give them two stars since the food we did receive was good."}
{"text":"Went here couples time and order The same Crawfish every time And  I don't like potato But they keep putting it in there everytime and I did say Please NO potato ok I just don't get it why they keep put it in there when I say No Potato so I guess they put it in to weight more heavy and little less crawfish or something.  Please owner fix this matter and make your costumer happier and they will recommend other people for you because this problem is easy to fix. Ths  Hopefully it will be better bc I love crawfish"}
{"text":"The food here was great, although I'm not really into crawfish, the crab legs and seasonings were great!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious got shrimp clams and frozen crawfish-- spicy boy that thing was delicious but got your nose runny!  Usually I can handle spice but not that day.  I'm not a fan of frozen crawfish but the clams and shrimp were good!!!"}
{"text":"Today I ordered 3 pounds of live crawfish to go. When I got home and started, I found most of the crawfish were very small and the meat felt mushy. Finally, I stopped eating when got one even tasted rotten. I called the store and the explanation from the manager was that it's at the beginning of the season therefore crawfish were very small and it was very hard to cook small crawfish. I'm not an expert of crawfish but at least some advice or warning should be given before a customer makes an order. I had ordered their frozen crawfish many times before and they were good. However, today's live crawfish were a total disappointment. I asked for a full-refund and the manager agreed. He suggested that after April the crawfish will be at their regular size."}
{"text":"Been to Hot and juicy a couple of times. Service is very good they always make sure you are having and good experience.  Each time I have the Catfish basket and A pound of shrimp and its been great each time. Love this location and I think Tiffany gives the service in the whole place."}
{"text":"Crawfish and Shrimp isn't too bad here. Nothing crazy or special. This is pretty much similar to Boiling Crab in San Jose, Ca. It's really crowded in here. And the service is super slow.  remember to SUCK THE HEAD. It's where all the juice and flavor is."}
{"text":"One pound of shrimp, 3 beers and a dozen sausages was a perfect meal! Great friends, great food equaled a great time. Worth the wait and I will be back! Lobster, muscles, king crab were the pinnacle to the meal!  Laura was a great server!"}
{"text":"Finally came to eat here after hearing about this place for so long. The food is a little pricey but there's not too many competitors in the area so it's worth it. Our server was Gianna and she was the best! Super friendly and gave great recommendations (thank you!) I liked the Cajan and Garlic flavors the best!"}
{"text":"Our food here was really good! Our server was missing in action a few times, but was really nice. Hubbs wanted Ginger Ale, but they didn't have any so our server mixed Coke with Sprite...and guess what, it actually tasted very similar to Ginger Ale (minus the ginger). Who knew?    Ok so Hubbs ordered a Shrimp Po' Boy and I ordered catfish with Cajun fries. The server recommended that I have the fish fried crispy and I'm glad that I did. The food was good and really inexpensive. Our food total was $30 and we were full. The shrimp po' boy was a decent size and had plenty of shrimp. The fried catfish was seasoned perfectly and came with a heap of fries.   We had to skip the shelled seafood because having braces and eating shelled crab/crawfish don't mix unfortunately. But several ppl around us really seemed to enjoy it!"}
{"text":"I've originally tried hot & juicy at the Tempe location multiple times with no bad review, service was fast, taste was consistent etc. The past couple times at the Westgate location  was a hit or more miss. Extra spicy seasoning seems different every time, the service was slow. It took 40 minutes for our server to give me my extra cup of extra spicy sauce. When it was all said and done she still ended up charging me for the cup.  Hot & juicy is a good quick seafood food fix joint nothing spectacular about the food."}
{"text":"If you come here you're in for a treat. Ordering may take a while because you're trying to decide what to have.   I ended up trying the snow crab, shrimp, and calamari. They were all very good. If you want something spicy then you've come to the right place.   If you have no problem peeling your food and getting your hands a little dirty then you wouldn't mind eating here. I had to clean my shrimp down from head to tail. It'll take some time to get use to but you'll get the hang of it.   The service was excellent, but it would've been nice if they picked up some of the things off of the table. Another thing that bothered me was how many flies or gnats were around our table. It was pretty disgusting having to guard my friends food while he went to the bathroom.   Overall food was good and so was the service."}
{"text":"5 of us went in on Thursday. The food is really awesome. But they need to train their wait staff there. These kids are the worse, they never come back to refill your drinks and when they do they filled it up with water. Then instead of taking care of their customers, they are sitting in the back tables talking and texting on their phones. Waited more than 30 minutes before I had to go up and ask our waiter for the bill, could not even look at me, because he was to busy texting. Had one of his buddies drop off the check with no apologies, and walks right out the door. then has the nerve to add on the tip, where if he had taken care of his customers they way he should have. He would have gotten tipped at least 30% instead of the 17% he added on. We order appetizers, we got them after our main meals, like 20 mins. later. Not happy, because I am in the same industry, but then again I know how to take care of my customers, since the tips that they are so kind to give to me helps put food on my table and a roof over my head. I need to find a new place to eat, BOILING CRAB maybe."}
{"text":"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place. Could yous a mop and a full time bathroom attendant bUT the food is amazing... Asian/Cajun at its best. Strap on the bib and be prepared to stay a long time... then get a massage next door!!"}
{"text":"I might have singly handed given them more business than any ad they have ever taken out... I discovered this 7 years ago in Vegas and have been there no less than 12 times. (New location by the flamingo) This might be my favorite restaurant west of iowa. The Asian Cajun boils are amazing.... a must!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went for the first time today!!!!!!!!!!!! I had the snow crab w/ Hot N Juicy Mild and my husband had the shrimp (huge shrimp), same sauce.....My o My were we in heaven!!!!!!!!!!!!!. The service was phenomenal and the food was even better. We are definitely returning ......."}
{"text":"Love the crawfish and shrimp. Sooooo amazingly good. However it's always packed and some of the host and servers aren't the nicest and sometimes not friendly. I'd honestly say it's a good location but when you want to be treated right go down a block to the Hot and Juicy closet to spring mountain and valley view because those girls and servers have been the best every time no matter what time of day it is. It's smaller but sometimes you feel like they just pay that much more attention to you."}
{"text":"So the restaurant is featured on man vs food and BOOM!  Every one is fighting to get in the door.  I remember a while back, my friend took me to the one on the west side on Spring Mountain and we had to park down the street and walk over.  As we were getting closer, there was a line of people waiting to get into the restaurant.  It was like waiting to get into the hottest club - but when I took a look into the restaurant, it was small and a whole bunch of people just eating crawfish, crab, and shrimp with their hands, plastic everywhere, and I was just not excited to wait and go on that ride so we decided to go elsewhere.    Well, a few years have passed - I am visiting Vegas and my friends tell me that they are celebrating a bday at this restaurant - and I think \"Oh no, not sure if I want to do that\", but I decided to not be a party pooper and go.  So we were a party of 20+ and the restaurant was a good space so I was happy about that.  There were napkins and plastic everywhere on our table and the table was covered in paper.  I was told to put on a bib and order the shrimp and crawfish.    I was scared.  In my eyes, if you are going out to eat and you are paying an establishment to cook your food for you, you should not be preparing to nip/tuck (getting ready to get into surgery).  So the food comes out and here comes a bag of shrimp and a bag of crawfish that they stick in front of my face.  I ask my friends (who are not amateurs at this restaurant), \"What now?  How the hell do I eat this?\" They tell me to stick the food on the table and peel the shrimp.  Ok, peel, peel, peel, then eat.  Then the crawfish.  How the hell do I eat a crawfish?  You break off its head and pull the tail to eat the meat, I was told. 3 minutes after crushing this crawfish like a ravenous eagle, I take its insides and put it in my mouth.  Then I think, \"All this work for less than a bite full of food?\"  Don't get me wrong - the flavor was good, but this is hard work.  After I devoured my food, I was tired.  My hands hurt, I smelled like fish and shrimp, and I was ready to take a shower.  For the first time, I think it was a good experience, but the next time I plan to eat out, I will go to a restaurant that does all the work and I won't feel so dirty after eating."}
{"text":"This was my first time there and Wow I was impressed. The staff was wonderful and the food came out so fast! It was so Hot (temperature wise)as well. The atmosphere was enjoyable with TV and nice music."}
{"text":"I come to vegas often to play poker.  I always make it a point to visit HotnJuicy.  Crab legs, shrimp, oysters. Everything is amazing.  Are you going to smell of the special seasoning sauce after? Most definitely.  This is one of my favorite spots to eat off strip. Fantastic as always."}
{"text":"Called to place an order and was hung up on. Called backed to see if they put the order in anyway. Was placed on hold for over 5 mins. Called back and placed a new order. Was told she didnt know how to ring up my order and asked could she call me back. I told her no I would just stay on the phone which she accepted. Was placed on hold for over 10 mins and she never got back to me. Called back to speak to a manager and a guy answered. Asked him if they were taking phone orders. He said yes but give him a few minutes because he's putting in other orders! How about an online ordering system or at the least two phone lines."}
{"text":"Pretty good bagged up seafood.  Better quality seafood than most, but their bathrooms were unkempt and disgusting.  They should really hire someone to just take care of that if they can't have people rotate in to clean it.  Decent service, but also it's all hands and not forks or plates so it gets messy with lots of used napkins.  It was good, but a little dirty in there."}
{"text":"ALWAYS AWESOME, but don't wear nice clothes or do your hair before going here because you will smell like seafood.   I love visiting Hot N Juicy when I'm in town and its always a great experience. Its definitely a get your hands dirty kind of place but the food is cooked and spiced exceptionally well.   I normally don't try to get too spicy but you can never tell HOW spicy it will be. There are some days where it'll be TOO hot and some days where its mild. So I took a chance and decided to do a pound of shrimp Hot N Juicy Medium. This day is wasn't too spicy so I ate absolutely everything with no problem.   Of course, I tried using gloves to keep my hands clean but that failed so I opted to go gloveless. To get the smell of seafood off your hands, just squeeze some lemon juice on your spicy saucy hands and wash them in the sink. Thank god this location has sinks in the hall because its always so hard to open the bathroom doors with dirty hands.   No matter what, everything smells like seafood so I would suggest just eating everything there if you can because you don't want your car to smell like seafood."}
{"text":"My husband and I stayed in Vegas for a week and went here twice!  We loved it!  I could only take the \"no spice\" but my husband went for the medium.  We got the Hot n Juicy spice combination and it was delish!  Make sure you order enough beer to wash the feast down, can't wait to go back!  YUM!"}
{"text":"Quality of everything -service, food- has gone down since they opened the new locations. I probably won't be back, ever! Ordered xtra spicy and mild spicy shrimps and it was probably switched around. So I was stuck with 3lbs of xspicy (suppose to be mild) for the table. The sauces were also soooo watery. Basically soup in a bag. $50 for dungeoness crab. No thx. Clams came out with black muck all over a few of them. Ewww. Nothing to come back for."}
{"text":"Im about 10 miles from this location but its worth the drive.  The other two locations on Spring Mountain are smaller and usually very busy.  Food is great service is awesome and it doesn't hurt that the waitresses are cute too!!!"}
{"text":"Great food great service. Randy our waiter was cool. Got our food quickly and made sure we were good the whole time."}
{"text":"They are not cheap!!! They do not use fresh things...all frozen ... not whole a lot portion for the pricing either..."}
{"text":"Just in Phoenix. I dis not realized that there is a hot and juicy crawfish. Went in and asked if they are the same owner as the one in Las Vegas, and they are. Very happy because the one is Vegas also very good. Ordered one pound of clams and a pound of crawfish. Both with spicy garlic butter sauce. They have all sorts of sauce and spicy level. I never tried any other sauce because this is my favorite and I am sticking with it. This part of Phoenix is very up scale and hip. Park at the Chase parking garage and just walk to the restaurant to soak in the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Love this place.  When guests visit bring them here.  Selina our server and she is fantastic!  Bring back 2 for 1 beer on Mondays tho!"}
{"text":"The seafood and dining experience was great!  We ordered the crawfish and snow crab and it came out perfect. We were very impressed. Will definitely come back when we're back in town again!  Oh and Phil is the shit!! :)"}

{"text":"So I am kinda new here, but I decided to join to write for a restaurant I really care about.  I have been going to Hot N' Juicy ever since the Man v Food filming for the Travel channel show. I have to say that every time I have been there the service has been more than accommodating. The waitresses are very sweet and pretty and all the servers and staff are beyond friendly.   As for the food, you really can't go wrong with a big ol' bag of snow crab legs and shrimp. I always get at least a dozen sausage and oysters to go with them. The sauces are out of this world good. My friend and I always get the nosebleed sauce on the side so we can just dip everything in it and use the rice on the side to cool down. It is an exhilarating experience. This place is hands down a one-of-a-kind experience for those in Vegas. I have lived here my whole life and have not found such an inexpensive restaurant that offers this kind of experience to this scale.   IMPORTANT: All the claims of sanitation issues and health violations are completely FALSE! They have recently been checked by the state health department and have been cleared of all false accusations.  Please don't let a few negative words fool you on this joint. Just go there and try for yourself. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"They say Disneyland is the happiest place on Earth - which is true - but I say  Hot N Juicy is the happiest place on the Western Hemisphere!   Every time I have friends or family fly in from out of town I take them to Hot N Juicy Crawfish. The first thing they say to me on their next trip to Vegas is \"Take me back for more of that Hot N Juicy!\" and then I tell them, \"Woah, slow down, I don't swing that way!\" And then I proceed to give them what they crave: Hot N Juicy Crawfish!  I have been going to the original HnJ ever since the Man V Food episode was filmed there, but the newest Hot N Juicy has a more special feeling to it. It definitely has a more youthful vibe than the older one.   Pro-life-tip #23: Take a first date here. If they can handle you being dirty and smelly, they can probably stick around for longer than a month. If they don't enjoy it, sounds like a one-night stand!  Favorite choices: Snow Crab Legs, Shrimp, Sausage (cant get enough of their meat!), and some of the best wings and fries in town!  The servers are all super friendly. Also, they like men who play with their food ;) *winkedy winky*  If you're looking for more than just dinner, definitely check this place out. It's a food expedition!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place! Must go to place or must TRY!!! Food is delicious, I personally like hot n juicy shrimp & crawlfish. Great atmosphere, service, and music!"}
{"text":"I heard about this place from a friend, and during my last trip to Sin City, made it a point to come here.    Got here around 8:00, and waited about 15 mins, which was not bad at all considering I normally wait around 2 hours at Boiling Crab.    Once we were seated, we ordered sweet potato fries,  the fried catfish basket, 1 pound of crawfish, 2 pounds of shrimp, both with the Hot n' Juicy sauce.    The hot and juicy sauce lacked flavor, we literally had to add salt to it  to liven it up.  The sweet potatoes fries were not crispy, and the catfish had way too much batter.  Eh , maybe I came on an off day, but I am willing to give this place another try."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved it.  My husband and I ordered the get your feet wet with hot n juicy spice and medium heat.  We love spicy food and it was enough to give us a good kick.  This is a tasty and dirty meal so be prepared to wear a bib and gloves.  This was my first time eating shelled crawfish and shrimp but it was a great experience."}
{"text":"Wife and had the shrimp and king crab legs....SO good! Gives boling crab a run for their money! The music that they play is awesome too. This will definitely be one of our must-do's every time we go to Vegas."}
{"text":"This was the BEST CRAWFISH BROIL I'VE EVER HAD? I'm from the South and I thought to myself... let me see what Vegas calls good crawfish. I had the crawfish, shrimp, andouille sausage, corn and potato with hot and juicy seasoning with spicy heat level. All of these ingredients were seasoned to perfection- flavors were cooked throughout yet not overpowering. ALSO the staff was very attentive and was helpful as I tried to figure out what I wanted to order. I need y'all to expand to the south. Mmm mmm good!"}
{"text":"My favorite crawfish spot so far!!! I really like how they cook the crawfish. It was flavorful without being over-sauced. Just enough garlic so it did not over power the cajun flavor. Most of other crawfish places are salty, too much butter, and drowned in powder. This place is different. When I saw the bag of crawfish, I only saw crawfish, not a bag of red sauce. Fries were crisp and spiced! Service was great. Love it!"}
{"text":"This place is trying to follow the success of Angry Crab. The prices are high and set for the ASU Asian high disposable allowance crowd. If you do not know how to order your crab you will receive the least value (no claw) by default. The catfish is Ok, but the fries are soggy, and overall their offering is only average."}
{"text":"Delicious shrimp and snow crab legs!!! Their hot and juicy sauce is the best but def spicier than usual so order one level down from what you usually get! Great meal."}
{"text":"Was really looking forward to trying Hot n Juicy so I ordered over the phone to pick up and take home. The girl on the phone told me the price would be $50.90 and I am absolutely 100% positive this is what she told me because I had to tell my significant other to transfer money to me. When I arrived and spent 10 minutes looking for a place to park and finally went inside she told me it would be $80. I told her that the girl on the phone told me it would be $50 and she said that i'd have to redo my entire order. Meaning I would have to wait another 20 minutes for my food to be ready."}
{"text":"Such a disappointing service tonight. It's almost as if every time I come in, my service is never right. The last few times I've placed my orders for pick up and I've never had to deal with any service issues but tonight my best friend brought me in for my birthday.   It was Sunday evening around 4:30pm. It didn't look busy and they were only seating one side of the room. However they told us it would be a 15 min wait. I got a text message 5 mins later saying our table was ready. YAY! Once we were seated we saw new drink menus. I decided to try their new Craw on Mary drink and we placed an order for a pound and a half of shrimp.   After that our server never stayed the same throughout the night. We finished our shrimp bags pretty quick. (First meal of the day) and wanted to order more food. The service picked up since we arrived and there was probably 15 tables total.   I seen servers and managers running around like chickens with their heads cut off. Seemed as if they were overwhelmed with the dinner rush being there was also a line waiting outside the door. However, there seemed to be plenty of servers AND managers running around. With that said, it was still hard to get service. We had to flag someone down just to place another order and for drink refills. One manager came to pour my friend some water and spilled some on the table, smh!   Another manager had taken our second order and started running away except we weren't even done ordering..  After we were through with dinner we once again had to flag someone down for our bill and it took even longer for someone to come grab our book. My friend got so irritated she brought the bill up to the desk and the lady behind the counter says rudely, \"are you ready to pay?\" We weren't asked how everything was and there was no apology given for the wait.   This place has been open for sometime now. I don't understand the lack in customer service every time I dine in!"}
{"text":"Amaz-ZING! The chairs were very comfortable. Prob one of my top 5 restaurant chairs i've ever introduced my ass to. Will def come back just for the chairs next time I'm in Vegas. The food wasn't too shabby as well"}
{"text":"Yeah the food was good, but everything else was a hot mess.  Super sticky floors in the whole restaurant and in the bathroom, but a little forgiveness was given as it is a seafood-in-a-bag with liquid awesomeness kind-of place. Spills happen. The Price: (everything is ala carte, even the butter) The servers share their tips so we had 3 or 4 different people check on us. This only turned out to be a big problem as orders were taken by different people and corrected by other people and nobody knew what the heck was going on. Order by the LB: -Dungeness Crab $18/LB (served as a whole crab) Turned out it was 1.8lbs and I shared half a crab with my wife. Only got one set of legs for half of $35 and I had to go eat somewhere else afterward. -Kids chicken nuggets. Good, not the best, came with fries and I asked if she could do half reg fries and half Cajun. She said yes and it didn't happen. Another waitress came by and I asked about it and she ran away to charge me for another order of fries. Caught another girl to cancel it. The one who ran away came back and I made sure it was cancelled. It came anyways, twice. Twice also they brought the rolls out that I ordered (3 rolls) with butter. No butter came, just another batch of rolls. A manager came by and it got weird. She eyeballed me and asked \"Did you ask for butter!?\" And I said yes I did originally.. and when I never received the rolls.. and I am asking again now. Got the butter comped. I never thought I would have to utter those words. The butter came and it was a bucket of the liquid butter, as after I asked if something went wrong again I found out that they have no spreadable butter. It seemed very wrong, but tasted ok dribbling down your chin with everything else. My dad got the fried shrimp basket and fries. Pretty awesome tasting grub, the cajun fries and the shrimp were so good my daughters ate half of his instead of their upscale McNuggets. I liked the food, but it was out of any normal price range for the just-ok kids food and shotty service.  $80 and I left with a headache and hungry. Then I went and spent $30 at the yogurt place. Ouch tho"}
{"text":"I have longed avoided places like Hot N Juicy because of my laziness for peeling shrimp and other assorted types of shellfish. After watching that one episode of Ugly Delicious on Vietnamese Cajun, I found myself more receptive to trying this type of cuisine. Man, have I been missing out!  First off, this type of food definitely fits the bill of ugly delicious. You will get messy despite the bibs, gloves, or plastic-covered tables. You pay for market price for the shellfish per pound (it can get pricey!), but you can add in corn, sausage or potatoes in the flavor-soaked marinades as well. We opted for a pound of shrimp and a pound of green mussels. We also got to try the snow crab legs. There are many different types of seasonings, but we stuck with their specialty Hot N Juicy marinade. For spice level, if you can't handle spicy food at all, stick to mild. Medium was a bit too much for me to enjoy.   I was surprised by how large and jumbo the shrimp sizes were. That also goes for the crab and mussels. The corn was a delicious teaser addition to our bag. A side of rice is also nice to temper the intense flavors. They also have excellent cajun fries!  Pro-tip: Everyone here gets Sprite to wash all that seasoned food down. Trust!"}
{"text":"A bit overpriced like others have said - but I have to admit the hot n juicy sauce is just as good as my parents crawfish boil special sauce. We did get mild because the waitress said their stuff is spicier than average, and I was glad because it was spicy as hell, but the sauce was delicious. The corn was over cooked in the bag and there was what seemed like too much shrimp vs crawfish. The beer and micheladas were only $5 so cant beat that for a strip restaurant. Wouldn't go again, but gave it 4 stars for the sauce alone. My husband did like the snow crab legs in the bag - we got the combo bag."}
{"text":"i wasn't expecting such a large crowd at 8 pm on a Monday but we got a table (a big booth for just the two of us) so FIRST thing you do is call ahead and see how the wait is. nobody likes to wait having to smell the delicious garlicky joy of this place while hungry. nobody.    ordered some oysters for an appetizer, they were so good we put in for another order. beer is cold and cheap.   now to the juicy part. three kinds of Crawfish were ordered. the hot and juicy special extra spicy, juicy Cajun and a garlic one. the hot and juicy special extra spicy is only for those that love hot foods. i do, so i was happy. to be honest start with the least hot and work your way up because after eating the extra spicy and drinking the beer i couldn't really tell the difference between the juicy and the garlic. my hands smelled like garlic for days after, wear the lobster bib, don't eat on a first date unless you have a great sense of humor, the service is excellent. the only and i mean ONLY downside is we never received any sides we ordered, i would eat here once a week if i lived closer."}
{"text":"If y'all know me I am a huge seafood lover, and this is a long, over due review lol.   FOOD: On point every time. First, I cannot stress enough on how fresh their crawfish is and how consistently tender the meat is. I've also had their mussels, clams, crab legs, and shrimp and they were all consistently juicy, tender, and delicious. I never have to worry about whether the seafood item I want is in season or not because I trust that they serve the freshest ingredients every time. Next, the sauce and spice level! For seasoning, you can choose from: Louisiana, juicy cajun, garlic butter, lemon pepper, and hot n juicy; for spice level, you can choose from: baby spice, mild, medium, spicy, and extra spicy. I recommend ordering the crawfish, shrimp, and mussels by the pound with either the hot n juicy or garlic butter sauce at mild level, white rice, and sweet potato or cajun fries.   SERVICE: I prefer this Hot n' Juicy location over the others because it's the cleanest and conveniently located next to Bambu. All the servers are usually friendly, but I have to give a shout out to Max K. He is always attentive, friendly, and personable. I generally know what I want to order, but he makes the extra effort to suggest other items without pressuring me; tip: the oysters are large and juicy, so I highly recommend that if you're into raw oysters. If you're a new customer or returning customer, and got Max as your server, just know that you're in good hands and will receive a fantastic dining experience!  OVERALL: I highly recommend this place if you're down for a messy and juicy experience. Buying seafood buy the pound, getting your fingers dirty, wearing a bib, and drinking an ice cold beer is the best way to enjoy a family style meal if you ask me."}
{"text":"Wow, decided to give it another chance after the manager reached out to me. This time we did dungeness, snow crab legs, and motzerella sticks. The crab was some of the best I have ever had. Ali, our server, was friendly and prompt. Great experience. Will be back!"}
{"text":"What a great restaurant! A real local gem!  There is a very simple menu: crab, shrimp, crawfish etc. that you order by the pound. You decide if you want it spiced mild, medium, strong or extra strong. We had the softshell crab appetizer, 2 pounds of crawfish and a pound of snow crab legs. Mmmmm delicious!  Be prepared to eat with your hands and to get them covered in juice and sauce, but that only adds to the sensous quality of the experience.  The wait staff are all sweet and helpful; they seem genuinely happy that you're there, and if it's your first time they'll lead you through the challenge of what to order.  On a side note: I stupidly forgot my wallet on the table when I left. About an hour later (I still hadn't realized it was missing), one of the girls who works there showed up on my doorstep with the wallet. I wanted to kiss her!  And I thought I couldn't love this restaurant any more than I already did!"}
{"text":"Hot N Juicy is a really cool idea.  I love that there are no plates, silverware, or f*cks given.  You order the seafood you want, the sauce on it, and the spice level.  They bring it to you in a bag and each table gets its own roll of paper towels.  You just dig into the bag, eat your food, and toss the leftover shells on the table, again very cool and fun.  However, the sauce I got, Hot N Juicy flavor, was EXTREMELY salty.  Think Ramen Noodle flavor packet salt....  And I got Spicy, and it was barely spicy.  Had the crawfish, mussels, lobster, and crab.  All the seafood was very good.  Wait staff was hit or miss, they did not come around much.  Also they are just starting a full bar, so if you have a margarita, and it tastes good, you're welcome I told the bartender what to do different.  Atmosphere was all over the place.  The music is loud and all over the place, not that it's a bad thing.  Also there was no soap left in the bathroom...  After getting my hands completely covered in sauce basically up to my elbows, I was hoping for some soap to help clean off.  Anyway, I would saw give it a go because their seafood was tasty,  but just be weary of the sauces."}
{"text":"Super spicy!! I love it. They really mean it when they say its spicy woo! Great friendly and fast service too :))"}
{"text":"We went here for my husband's birthday. We were a large party of probably 18-20 people. We arrived before they opened up. Upon checking in the girl at the front sighed so loud and was so annoyed that we were there. She was so annoyed that we were a large party I guess. I'm thinking when we got there and there wasn't anyone there she would be happy to have the business. We were a relatively easy group, nothing difficult. We were also here for our very first visit. Some say that the food was better and they preferred it over Angry Crab, others disagreed. I don't eat seafood so I can't weigh in other than to say I had the chicken strips. They were ok. I guess if I had to say, they were better than the non-seafood at Angry Crab. Angry Crab has terrible BBQ and bad burgers for those who don't eat seafood. At least the chicken here was edible.   Overall, we had a nice birthday lunch just wish we could have had better service considering we were trying to celebrate."}
{"text":"Food was great. Everyone was nice and friendly. I notice good looking people work here and they work as a team and help each other out good music very welcoming BUT every time we asked for something they forget. The first time our waitress forgot she apologized. Thanks for that not just anyone can admit that. But then I noticed everyone would forget what we asked for. We had to keep asking they wouldn't check on our drinks . If your serving spicy shrimp I would think people need refills often. Something that should be worked on. And keep in mind we went when it wasn't that busy.   We will definitely give them a second chance hopefully it improves. But if we get the same results we will not be recommending."}
{"text":"My favorite local place for seafood . I LOVE this restaurant and the price isn't bad for it being seafood . Definitely a must go to ."}
{"text":"If you love seafood just as much as i do, you wont regret coming here.I kept it simple, ordered  a pound of crawfish with a side of cajun fries, which were delicious.I highly recommend this place for my seafood heads."}
{"text":"Don't go here if you dislike: Sucking the delicious mustard out of tiny shellfish's head then devouring their savory little bodies, getting messy with your food, enjoy chatting with the people around you as they suck off their little friend's heads, fast service, friendly wait staff, or having fun with your food.  Seriously though, this place is the place to go for your crawfish fix in LV outside of Louisiana. I eat a ton of crawfish (okay, maybe half a ton) so believe me when I said I didn't think there would be a place outside of the Bayou that does crawfish this good. The wait staff were fast and tentative and will leave you in peace if they see you are happily making a mess of yourself in enjoying your food. The only thing I would have to say is negative is not to get the sausage as it's not as good as the other items on their menu. Definitely give this place a try if you slither out of the Bayou like I do once in a while."}
{"text":"Great food! Always tastes amazing.  Staff is nice too! Great customer service. Cheers!"}
{"text":"I'm from Alaska and I grew up eating fresh seafood all the time. It's so hard for me to find seafood here in Las Vegas that is actually good and doesn't taste old and frozen. I'm so happy I found this place! The shrimp was incredible and we inhaled the corn fritters. I'll definitely be going back the next time I crave shrimp!"}
{"text":"Don't head over for an early business lunch since they don't open till noon. Here is a hint for a restaurant owner in Arizona. It's hot outside. We start work early. We eat lunch early. You are losing a lot of business if you don't open by 11. 11:30 at the latest."}
{"text":"Got $60+ of crawfish yesterday and it was overcooked... The meat was falling apart like the way it would when they're dead before you cook them. So sad. I usually love this place but I was sooooo disappointed this time :("}
{"text":"Love to eat here whenever we're in Vegas..our favorite dish is the pound of shrimp with the works / medium sauce. ..always so yummy!"}
{"text":"Parking is such a hassle, but honestly the food is so amazing, which makes it so worth it.  A little hectic and hard to get refills and if you ask for something extra they usually forget, but the food is still amazing!"}
{"text":"4.5 star realistically.  This is truly one of the must have spots when you visit Vegas!  The first thing you notice in the overwhelming smell of fresh crustaceans!  The reason I marked them down a little is because our server was average and even had a small attitude or annoyance in her tone.  We are new and wanted some help in explaining how the experience and ordering process worked.   I went for the 1 lb of crawfish and added 2 half ears of corn and two red potatoes to the bag.  I chose the Hot N Juicy seasoning with a medium spice level.  The medium spice level had my nose dripping a little and I like spice.  They told us the crawfish were a little smaller this time of year, and 1 lb consisted of 16, which was still a good amount. The seasoning was excellent! Never really tasted anything quite like it, had a unique flavor.. a mix of Asian and Cajun.   I finished with the only dessert option on the menu, the fried brownie bites.  Again, better than expected.  Crispy on the outside gooey, hot and rich on the inside.  Next time I'm in town, I'll be sure to make time for dinner here again."}
{"text":"Sooooo gooooood!  Put the lemon pepper sauce on everything! I had the lemon pepper shrimp and crab legs and they were both the BOMB.   And if you get the chance, make sure Britney is your waitress. She's better than the lemon pepper sauce!!!"}
{"text":"I shared The Drool($47.99) with my husband. It was lots of food! their shrimp is big! corn is sweet, andouille sausage makes good flavor! We enjoyed it!  Our server was kind of sloppy. She didn't give us an apron nor hand wipe. I found out they have an apron after we left this place, luckily I found they have hand wipes at casher area when I came back from bathroom to wash my hand and I grabbed some for my husband."}
{"text":"Definitely a must visit when you're in Vegas. Away from the hustle and bustle of the strip, this place is such a gem, who needs seafood buffet when you have Hot N Juicy? This place offers affordable and delicious seafood!  My friend and I both got 1 lb of shrimps each (with heads on). Each pound was $13 which was pretty affordable. We both got them in the Hot and Juicy special sauce which I highly recommend by the way! The waitress was very accommodating and service was very quick. We had such an awesome meal and I couldn't ask for anything else better. This place is a must re-visit when I come back to Vegas in the future!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  It's much better than boiling crab.  Hot and juicy's original sauce is amazing. Very tasty.  The rolls came out warm and soft.  The corn was sweet and tasty.  I ordered the shrimp and blue crab.  So good!!!    The calamari appetizer is good too."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Hot N Juicy but I feel as if it's a tad bit too much for every employee to have on red lipstick. I believe that everyone should be their own person and makeup doesn't define who you are. This is a restaurant not a club. Despite this Ashley, Mary, and Savon were excellent waiters!!! I really enjoyed my visit to Hot N Juicy!!"}
{"text":"The flavor of the food was good but the service was lacking. The server brought out our food at different times. We had 7 in our group and all our food was brought out at different times. I got my main course, my wife didn't get her till almost 30 minutes later. My side dish didn't get to me until 20 minutes after my main course. We had two young kids with us and their food was the last one to get to our table. We ran out of napkins and I had to go to an empty table and get my own. It would of nice to have some sort of silverware to help my daughter break open her crap legs. Not sure if we'll go back anytime soon."}
{"text":"The best place to go if you like fresh great tasting great seasoning great atmosphere and great food! Every time I go to Vegas I at least go one time too hot and juicy a minimum of one time every time I go to Vegas!!!! Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"Well I have been hearing about this place and I usually go to the Boiling Crab but decided to come here to see what the hype was all about. First off I should give 3 stars for the service because it could have been better...but they were friendly and apologized about it.   The food on the other hand was great!! I ordered 4 pounds of crawfish, a pound of shrimp, and dozen oysters. The only complaint was that the oysters were some of the smallest I have seen recently. There are a few sauce options when ordering the crawfish, shrimp, lobster, and crab. I ordered mild with everything mixed together. It was really good. I love crawfish and sometime if they are not cooked right its difficult to peel and these were not they were perfect.   They played dope music...well according to my liking it was old school hip hop and R&B. All in all had a good experience and would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I go there to support my friend who loves this place!  Yes he is Asian and I'm italian! Lol , so he drags me out   The staff is awesome, professional and pays attention to your table never letting the drinks go empty!  I usually get the chicken wings, they are yummy  and the sweet potato fries are good for you and delicious    Yum I love the corn  on the cob!  It's awesome for those who like seafood and don't mind digging in!  Funny, when I first ate there they had bibs and plastic gloves, I found out why, it's like a picnic style eating!  Lol    Great place to go and have fun and get full!  Definitely try it out!"}
{"text":"We went to the new one in Glendale Az, the food was very good. Exactly what I expected and then some. The seasoning was delicious! The spice level was perfect for people like me who like spicy food. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Maybe I'm stupid but I ordered the calamari from here to go.  It was good, but not great, and seemed a bit expensive at nearly $11.  Will have to go back here for crawfish."}
{"text":"Been waiting for over an hour to find out our ticket was never put in and now we will be waiting another 45 min before the food arrives! WTF? This better be some dam good food! Will update once we get our food, don't hold your beathes."}
{"text":"Gotta Love H&J !! Spices to die for!! Crab to Lust for.. Def one of my favorite places to eat in vegas!  PS dont go here if you have somewhere to be later in the day.. you will smell like spices.. and seafood.. and deliciousness!!"}
{"text":"Soooooooo gooooood!  First I would like to say that I recommend getting shrimp with medium spice because it gets real spicy after that.  I recommend shrimp instead of crawfish because you get more bang for your buck and it is less work to get your meat.  I went with a big group of people about 14 and they accommodated us really well.   When you order your food it comes in a big plastic bag filled with the tastiest sauce and spices you could ever dream of.  You have to un shell your shrimp or whatever else you order which may seem like a lot of work but once you take your first bite of this godly food you won't care anymore because any ounce of work is always worth that next bite.  You get so much food so the price is worth it and you will not leave displeased.  I have never been to Louisiana but I imagine this is how it must be down there or if anything this might be better!  Give it a try and you'll definitely want to come back!"}
{"text":"Even though the server sucked, the food was AMAZING. Me and my BF got the green mussels in spicy/hot and juicy and the shrimp in spicy/garlic butter! We also got the fried crawfish with Cajun fries! It was alllll soooooo amazing. I wore a white dress and was nervous but the bibs are awesome. Haha. Check them out!"}
{"text":"David our server was great! He was kind and friendly. Food came out hot and delicious. Crawfish's are huge and the perfect size."}
{"text":"It tasted great. The service was great.   ....but a terrible thing happened.  I ordered the king crab and clams. While I was eating a clam; I piece of a prawn's exoskeleton creeped into my mouth.   I cannot handle tentacles and the sauce was loaded with prawn parts!  I realize that this is a place that your \"food touches\" but pawns are just the things of nightmares and it kinda spoiled the crab. (and for $26 a pound.... it shouldn't be spoiled with drifting pieces-parts of other animals.)"}
{"text":"Fantastic seafood and incredible flavor. Some of the best étouffée I've ever had, plus a friendly staff and a great atmosphere. My first try of both HnJ and the \"seafood in a bag\" type place, but it's a must visit wherever/wherever you can. Bibs are a must."}
{"text":"First time here and the experience was AMAZING! Never been somewhere like that where the tables are covered in plastic and everything just get thrown in the table! The seafood was excellent, we ordered king crab, clams, crawfish and shrimps. For sides we ordered the Cajun fries, rice, corn fritters and corn on the cob everything but the corn on the cob was good. The corn however was horrible...didn't taste fresh, probably frozen and definitely over cooked, like a warm mushy sponge! Despite that everything else including the staff was wonderful...I recommend anyone visiting or living in Vegas to try them out!!!"}
{"text":"A blb, gloves and disposable tablecloth.   Roll up your sleeves, get a little messy (if you want to) and enjoy this place!     We did.    The shrimp are fresh and huge, with all the spice you want or even can handle.     The other fried menu items are pretty good as well if you want to go that route.       Ill be back.    This is a pretty good, pretty cool place in a great part of town.     Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Where do I even begin?? This place is an absolute blast! My wife and I decided to give it a try after reading some of the reviews here on yelp and we were not let down. Everything is very casual, plastic table cloths and foam cups for example. We ordered a pound of crawfish each, one pound with the hot and juicy seasoning and one with the Lousiana, both medium heat. They weren't kidding when they said the heat is one higher than you expect! The Lousiana was much hotter then we thought! But so so juicy, I was licking my fingers clean despite the burning, lol. Yes, the crawfish doesn't have much meat in it, its more an experience then filling meal. We tried the ettoufe (I think it is spelled that way) as an appetizer and it made the perfect start to the meal and were were very happy with the choice.   To the people who complain about the crab not being up to par.. keep in mind the name of the restaurant! Its a wonderful experience all in all and I highly recommend the place, just be prepared to make an extreme mess and dress appropriately!"}
{"text":"Yet another home run for hot n juicy I'm glad the service was good this time the food is so good I'm sitting fat and happy. Thank you"}
{"text":"Will consider opening a restaurant in Honolulu???  pretty please?  YES!  It was that delicious!  On my trip to Las Vegas, I was brought here by a couple of friends and I was hooked after that time.  My traveling buddy and I shared a pound of the Hot n Juicy shrimp with sausage, corn, and rice.  It was more than enough for the two of us.  The mild sauce had a big kick to it so if you're not the spicy fan, I don't even recommend the mild!  The sausage was really good as it had a snap to it and the corn was infused with a buttery version of the Hot n Juicy sauce.  The staff was excellent as they were very good with beverage refills as each of us polished off at least two sodas.    Hot n Juicy kicks all of the North Shore shrimp trucks in the face and make them beg to call it \"daddy!\"  I wished I had the time to come back again.  Any place that has me craving their food after a couple of weeks deserve 5 stars."}
{"text":"Service was amazing had multiple server's say hi or check on you as they walk by your table and if you get Phil your lucky he makes us feel at home each time and hasn't even been our server yet! Favorite location by far!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Service is good! Crawfish not the best but the shrimp and sausage was good. Highly recommend the hot & juicy seasoning. Cajun fries are hot so if u like spice those r perfect. Tasted the catfish basket and the catfish was Nice and crunchy."}
{"text":"Wow.  Amazing sauce and flavor.  Medium hot Cajun spice crawfish so good.  King Crab with butter garlic.  Wow.  Try this place now.  WEAR THE BIBB.   It's a very tasty mess.  I will be back soon. Service was top notch as well.  Only bad was too much loud rap music on sound system."}
{"text":"Been here three times already, but we've always gotten take out.  It's usually very busy and parking is a pain.  For a place that is so popping I'm surprise they are in such a tight spot with parking, etc.  The food though is great.  We usually get a few pounds of crab legs and a pound of shrimp.  I could eat the crab legs all by myself though lol and every time we finish eating I am left wanting more.  I had never had crab legs like this until I came here.  Everything is priced based on the market.  Can't wait to take my parents to the one in Orange County."}
{"text":"I love my service and my food was delicious. It was well seasoned and my waitress (jackie) was attentive throughout the entire meal. I will for sure be coming back"}
{"text":"Very poor experience. Asked for Dungeness crab. more like Dungeness watery crap. I asked if it could be put in the ice bucket after cooking as I like it fresh and cold. the waitress said they couldn't put it on ice in case something went wrong. ??????  I asked if they would bring ice. that seemed to work. Duh. Any body that's been to the west coast, i.e.: fisherman's Warf in San Fran knows what Dungeness should taste like and texture. the crabs at hot and juicy are all cooked in the same spicy water as every thing else.. the crab was under cooked because the white inside meat was sloppy and wet.it had a muddy taste like the boiling water was old. My wife's food came out first followed closely by the crab. too quick from the time of ordering, no where near enough time to cook a 2 lb crab. My daughter ordered shrimp. that NEVER arrived. after touching base with the waitress she said kitchen was backed up. repeatedly told us about the backup and yet people who had came in after us had their food..... don't bulls@!t me. they lost the order. After speaking with the manager. she had no clue about seafood in general. she has never eaten crab so she couldn't comment. I would make it a priority to taste and be knowledgeable of all the food I would be serving. On recap don't go there. Food poor. service poor and it wont belong before somebody gets sick.  Pete P"}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed this experience.  Such a different way to eat.  If you love seafood I highly recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"My husband, myself and my in laws really enjoyed this place. My inlaws and husband, being from and visiting  Maryland, know about good seafood. Everything about this place was awesome; great service, courteous and attentive servers and delicious food.   We had the shrimp and black mussels with Hot & Juicy/Spicy seasoning, and it was SO flavorful AND of course JUICY! My father in law had the snowcrab and loved them. Everything was cooked to perfection. Also tried the Cajun fries, Corn Fritters and Catfish basket, and we were very impressed. Everything was so flavorful right down to the tartar sauce. Prices weren't too high and pretty much priced the same as other places. We will definitely be going back. We used to drive to San Diego to the Crab Hut for seafood like this. I'm glad we have this place close by.   Heather, who I believe was the manager, was very, very nice, and made sure that not only we were being taken care of, but every other customer as well. I wish I had pics to post but we didn't have time for all that while eating all of this deliciousness! Check it out! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The hubs and I made this out first stop off the plane for lunch as we were too early for our hotel check-in. We waited about 20 minutes. Staff was extremely friendly and attentive. We ordered 1/2 lb. of shrimp, a lb. of crawfish and sausage and the soft shell crab platter. Seasoning was very tasty. I wish we ordered more shrimp. The soft shell crab was a little too battered. Still glad we gave it a try. I seriously think our waiter made the experience. He was awesome with refilling our drinks and bringing us extra gloves."}
{"text":"Hands down one of my top 5 restaurants in town. I've been coming to Hot n' Juicy for at least 10 years and I always leave satisfied. I used to live in the apartments right behind this place and OHHH you bet I was devastated when I moved because I wouldn't be in walking distance of this gem. Either location on Spring Mountain is fine to me, although this location is a lot roomier!  I always get snow crab legs with the hot n juicy seasoning and the hottest spice level because the flavor is so unique and delicious. Just thinking about the seasoning makes my mouth water. The only downside of eating here is my clothes have a strong smell to them for a while and if I don't put these clothes into the wash once I get home, the smell lingers around my house. But I don't mind this at all because this place is so delicious. I just wear gloves so the smell doesn't linger on my hands, and that's about it!  If you haven't been here yet, call me ASAP and let's get to grubbin'!"}
{"text":"You gotta rip off the tail and suck the head... Had some yummy crawfish here , they bring you gloves and a bib. Probably not the most appetising thing , watching people eat crawfish but sure was yummy. They were fast , very freindly and the joint was clean. I've eaten crawfish fresh out the gulf so can't compare but I would reccomend. Just remember if it smells like fish , have the chicken .!!!! Try this place."}
{"text":"While staying in Vegas we stopped by and tried hot n juicy and it met all of our cravings.  Simply amazing & I recommend it for anyone trying to try something new.  (Be ready to get dirty)."}
{"text":"Loved it here.  They only had frozen crawfish when I went on a Wednesday afternoon so I didn't get the crawfish.  Ordered soft shelled crab basket, snow crab legs, and clams.  All were delicious.  Clams were my favorite though.  Soft and perfectly cooked.   Overcooked clams irritate me.  These were perfect and not 1 grain of sand :)  1lb of that shared with my hubs was too little.  I am getting 1lb for myself next time plus another lb of something else!  So happy this is on the strip :)"}
{"text":"This is our seafood spot love the food and sauce that hot and juicy seasoning taste so great! Love the hands on of digging into my bag and enjoying down great seafood. Every time we go no matter time of day we never have to wait to be seated! The service in mediocre they care about speed against quality to each customer. Prices are a bit high. They keep your cup filled. Only thing is they forgot to bring gloves had to constantly  ask for some as u watched them bring out immediately to others."}
{"text":"\"Alright Man v Food! Let's see if this place lives up to the hype you gave it!\" After a mere 30 minute wait on a Saturday night, my girlfriend and I were ready to dig in. We had our bibs tied tight, gloves on comfortably and big empty stomach ready. Game on!  In order to make a proper assessment on this fine establishment, I ordered what I typically order at Boiling Crab. 1 lb. of shrimp w/ garlic butter medium and a basket of catfish.   1 lb. shrimp -- Pretty good-sized shrimp, comparable to Boiling Crab. However, the seasoning is a lot better at Boiling Crab. Not only was there a thick layer of oil but the flavor seemed to be missing something. Even when we re-dipped our peeled shrimp, it still tasted bland.  Catfish basket -- 4 pieces of thickly cut catfish fillets. Thick, juicy with a nice layer of breading. It was appetizing but still fell short. I'd prefer to get them from Boiling Crab. However, their cajun fries were a huge surprise. I think they were spicier than our shrimp seasoning.   Service was great. Everyone was on their A-game. A few different waiters/waitresses came by to check up on us. The place is just alright but I'd rather save my spicy-seafood-served-on-a-table fix for Boiling Crab."}
{"text":"This is as close to the cajun food in Nola as I have had. The crawfish, were excellent as were the shrimp. When in Vegas this will now be one of my regular stops. The price is great as well. Your going to get a bit grubby eating here, but that's part of the experience."}
{"text":"Idk if they were having an off day or what, but the sauce here just sucked big time!!!!!!!!!  There were four of us, we all got diff flavors to test them all out. They all tasted the same. There was TOO MUCH SUGAR and the quality of the seafood was crap.  I have never been so disappointed eating at a Cajun place.  The clams are huge and super Chewy and the corn fitters are a waste of money.  So disappointed!!!!! Even tho it sucked that bad I forced myself to eat all 3lbs AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA  I didn't want to waste seafood and I was getting ready to go on a flight. Was gonna be missing dinner so made to make sure my tummy was full. ** stop reading now or prepared to be grossed out***  The worse part was after eating, allI did was burp some disgusting rotten garlic smell than damn near killed my friends and passed major gas (thank god those weren't potent) they just hurt like a mother!!"}
{"text":"The food is good and the experience is awesome but the service was horrible. It took 30 minutes just to get a another cup of water it wasn't busy. And the customer service was rude I didn't like how we were treated."}
{"text":"Omg so many coworker and even my hairstyle told me about this place! So i finally decided to go on a Friday after work. I LOVED IT!! I don't want to sound like a total fatty BUT I was in heaven the whole time focused on my bag of crab!  The moment you open the bag of yummiest this amazing aroma hits you in your face, and you will just like i knew, it was about to go down!Everything was amazing. I ordered the snow crab with the  spicy hot and juicy seasoning; I was told it was the best and most popular, so of course I wanted to try that one first. The extras were very favorable with the hot and juicy seasoning and  is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED,  potatoes(.60 cent), sausage(1/2 dozen 2.45) and corn( i believe .75) . I now know  any other sides or anything extra aren't needed. I ordered a side of butter( which is a dollar extra) and didn't even touch it.   Also important: the customer service was great! Everyone was so nice and smiled with their service. HUGE plus for me! Last comment, I suggest that whenever you go don't come all dressed up because although this meal is  incredible it can also be very messy, which is the reason for the commentary bid and gloves that are given. All im saying is don't come to this place thinking you'll be going somewhere nice after because you will be leaving smelling like hot and juicy, and maybe a little sauce on your clothes.  I really hope your experience is as enjoyable as my experience!"}
{"text":"Only in Vegas can you have the best hot n juicy! The only downfall is I can't see the heads on my shrimp! (Don't judge me) lol but every now and than I get a kind waitress willing to cut them off for me. Other times not so much! Lol"}
{"text":"I came here for the UYE last night and loved it!  The staff was simply the best and the food was good.  It was my first time at one of these seafood places and the staff talked me through the entire process.    I ordered a pound of shrimp, medium spice, with the sauce being the Hot N Juicy which is a combination of all their sauces.  you put on your bib and some plastic gloves and when your bag of goodness arrives, you dig in and start taking off the shells.  After awhile, I got really frustrated with the slowness at which I was removing shells.  I took off the gloves and then the process became easier--messier fingers but faster work.  Robin was our main server and she was a GEM!  What a pleasant woman and what a help!  I will be back.  This is one of the things I do by myself unless my wife wants to have fried chicken fingers.  How you limit yourself if you don't do seafood!"}
{"text":"Just like boiling crab in san jose or crawdaddy.  very fun place. make sure you got some bank to spend.  Its located in chinatown and not many of the cabs know where it is.  Also plus its located next to a massage spot if your into that thing."}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised with this place. It was very clean and the food was great. It was recommended to us and it us no joke. We will be going here again the next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Customer service started good. Then my niece spilled her water and they did not bother to clean the floor up so we sat with a puddle of water. The trash bucket for the table even already overflowing was not emptied once. Afterwards, saw how they cleaned the tables..... handled the trash and went to give the check to us without washing their hands... did not even bother cleaning the table before putting a new tablecloth in...and this place does not have any plates so u have to eat on top of the tablecloth itself...  Food was also very bland... no taste except for the mozerella sticks. Ordered sweetpotato fries which they gave to us burnt....   One word about this place...run!"}
{"text":"Having Hot n Juicy just 2 nights after our first HnJ experience tells you a lot! We just had to have it again...it was that good!   I knew about this place thru a cousin's yelp check in on Facebook. So we decided to try it while on vacay...this is a MUST stop for all you visitors!    The first time we went, we visited the old location which doesn't compare to this newer location at all. This location is a lot bigger and more staff and most of them are cute and cut even the females look great.    So first time at the old location- what we had:    4 lbs of their crawdads...these are a waste of your money - most of these pinchers were about less than half an inch in size and were a pain to crack! Hubby ordered the spicy Hot n Juicy special and it was definitely HOT!!!  4 lbs of shrimps - THE BEST!!! Lemon Pepper is the bomb!  LP is my favorite, if you like the taste of lemon grass you'll definitely love this flavor.  Chicken Wings with fries - great  Calamari - yummy!  Sweet Potato fries - so yummy!   total for this visit - $162.00 for a party of 10 with 4 kids and 6 adults   2 nights later- we visit this new location...we just can't stop talking about it. It's that good!   What we ordered this time around:   5 lbs of shrimps...Garlic Butter, Louisiana, Lemon Pepper  2 Calamari Chicken nuggets with fries 7 orders of rice!!! - A MUST!!! 2 Sprite  2 beers   Total: $124.00   Spoon some of that juicy goodness on top of your rice and eat with your fingers!!! You can't let that sauce go to waste!!! DAYMN...just thinking about it makes my mouth water :)"}
{"text":"LOVE. This is a regular spot for my friends and I. We went there this weekend and got the snow crab. It was awesome! A lot of our crab legs were pretty skimpy on the meat tho, but we mentioned it to our server and she gave us an extra half pound. Then because it took so long to get that half pound (they were pretty busy), she changed it to an additional pound PLUS took a pound off of our bill.  I have noticed that the service is a little inconsistent...sometimes they go above and beyond and sometimes they don't. We have had a problem with getting our drinks refilled and getting our bill split. But it really does depend on the server. Sometimes they'll say that the bill can't be split, other times it's not an issue. One thing is consistent tho - the food is always delicious!!!! I've had the crawfish, mussels, snow crab, and shrimp. Their fries are pretty delicious (I usually order a basket to dip in the sauce). Their étouffée is also fantastic. Can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"every time I go to Vegas I always want to try this place out but never have time to stop by...on my last Vegas trip I was finally able to dine here...  the staff was NOT friendly at all...the host took my name and that was it...I asked her how long the wait would be and she shot back an attitude...ooookaaay  Paloma and Katie were the only two employees that actually knew what the definition of customer service...one star for each of them! you guys rock!!   I ordered one lb of crawfish and half lb of shrimp...the food came out, I took one look at it and knew it was not going to be enough to even put a dent in my stomach...I asked them to change my half order of shrimp to 1 lb...I've been eating crawfish long enough to know what 1 Lb of crawfish and 1 lb shrimp looks like...I mean, I did live at boiling crab at one point of my life! haha   Anywho, I got the sauce that had everything in it...whatever it was called...let's see...How should I describe the taste...NOT GOOD...I was so disappointed I had to force myself to I finish my food =\  Hunnie got the catfish basket...also not good...every bite that was out in my mouth tasted like the ocean...  The cajun fries were fries with very little spice on it  Sigh...sad to say...I would not be dining here again...I rather go down a few more blocks to ichiza! Now that place knows how to treat their customers and have amazing food!!"}
{"text":"We came here with a pretty large group. This was the first time I went to a place and just focused on crawfish. Glad we came here.  We shared pounds and pounds and bags and bags of crawfish/clams/corn ranging from mild to medium. Food was really good. Only complaint if it is one, is that the medium should be called hot and mild should be medium.  Service was friendly and good.  Some small cons were that parking was really annoying and some of the food options were a little limited for my taste. I'd still come back here when I'm in Vegas though."}
{"text":"1 word, AMAZING!!  If you love seafood, flavor, spice and making a mess. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"It is AMAZING HERE, their sauce is soooo deng good, out of all the crawfish place i've tried, this matches up to boiling crab.  I love the potato !!! it's sooo good with the sauce, i had it 2 days in a roll =X ! hahaha their crawfish is bigger than the one at boiling crab tho, the shrimp tastes good, but the skin is soft? haha, but overall it is amazing,   PROS:  Potato w their hot n juicy sauce! their crawfish size! the hot n juicy sauce!  CONS: the cajun fries, just fries with seasoning? it have nothing on the bc fries.  dont get it, its just regular fries! the charge extra for more seasoning on top of the seasoning thats already on there, (which is not enoughhh by farr)  their price is bout the same as bc, maybe a dollar more, but hey! ur in vegas, this place is definitely a stop to make!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. The taste is awesome. My family use to go to CA for Boiling Crabs.  Since this place opened, we stopped going to Boiling Crabs. We love the crabs, shrimps, and crawfish. We come here every two weeks.  If you haven't try, I highly recommend giving a try."}
{"text":"absolutly awsome place! great prices! I perfer over the boiling crab"}
{"text":"Best shrimp in town! However you like them, they got them! I love shrimp, and this is where I go to get mine."}
{"text":"One of the best places I've had in Las Vegas for crawfish! The size of the crawfish was great, however, I have not been here after crawfish season. The few times I've been here, it was never crowded and the there was practically no wait (even on the weekends)."}
{"text":"Wow never been, total newbie to crawfish. The hot n juicy sauce was so delicious. Garlic, slice and everything nice. David totally hooked us up and gave great crawfish shucking tips. I would come back in a minute but live in Seattle!   Pictures not posted too hungry and too delicious!"}
{"text":"Great food and really good service, thank you Molly! Plus, you're allowed to bring in your own food if someone with you doesn't like delicious spicy seafood."}
{"text":"This is a local's place, but just ask the hotel staff and they will give you directions. This place is small and there is nothing pretty about it. It just has great food at reasonable prices. Everything is super good. Beware the heat on the crawfish, but it is tasty and you will love it. You won't be getting silver wear either. Your meal will come to you in a bag and you just grab and enjoy. The service is friendly and great. Have fun."}
{"text":"We went here for an early lunch today, but found they don't open til noon everyday. We walked around westgate and came back around and was surprised to see a line out the door. My advice would be to show up a little early and wait. We got seated right away. We ordered the corn fritters and Cajun calamari to start. We were told that the corn fritters were like hush puppies, which they were not. Although the fritters were not like hush puppies, they were still good. They were small marble sized fried balls filled with almost like a cream corn with whole corn. The calamari was very good. It came fried and with a dry Cajun seasoning on top. We then got the snow crab, hot and juicy medium and the shrimp butter garlic medium. The snow crab was delicious and hot and juicy medium was just right. The shrimp were good, but we both agreed that the hot and juicy would be better on the shrimp next time. The service was great and our drinks were always filled promptly. If you want fancy shmancy, go to Mastros, if you want good, home cooking, finger lickin seafood, go here, you even get a bib."}
{"text":"Service was really slow. Probably because the kitchen was understaffed"}
{"text":"Came here with a bunch of friends during Valentine's weekend in which case the restaurant was super packed. The food was nevertheless amazing and our server Max was extremely funny, down to earth, and brought everything out with impeccable timing!! Next time you go, ask for max and his story about the \"frog with the straw\""}
{"text":"Bomb place to eat!  Service is great.  If you don't like your hands  to smell of food after,  bring some gloves. (The gloves they provide aren't that great)  We had the crawfish, calamari,  soft shell crab,  shrimp,  and some fries. . . And everything was excellent.   I highly recommend this spot if you like fresh seafood.  The wait to be seated is worth it!   (20 mins)"}
{"text":"Get the bib out and gloves , you are  going to need them... If you're  looking for the best shrimp you will ever eat, go here.  Yes, you have to take the head off but it is fresh and they cook them live. I got the garlic sauce, medium heat.  The clams are also amazing with great flavor.  You get so much shrimp for such a great price .  If you are looking to go on a first date, go here.  Just don't tell her... Then, you will see if she is worth a second date..lol"}
{"text":"Best fast seafood restaurant I've been to in Vegas maybe entire West Coast. But your fingers are going to smell like crawfish for a month."}
{"text":"mmmmmmm.......hot.....mmmmmmm......juicy.......mmmmmmmmm.....beeeeeeeeeer  There is no way you can complain. Of course there is a wait, which is probably why they opened a new one down the street. You go in, order your beer (mmmmmmm.....blue moon), and then peruse the menu. They have different kinds of shrimp, lobster, crab, and crawfish, duh. You get to pick a spiciness level and a flavoring to go with whatever sea food you pick. When they serve you, it's all in a bag with a possible potato or baby corn on the cob. You can even get a bib to protect your clothes from breaking all the shells and the juicy squishiness. You really can't go wrong. Bomb sea food (mmmmmmmmmm) and nice cold beer (double mmmmmmmmm).   Yes, your hands will get dirty. Yes, the food will be good. Yes, you will want to go back."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I LOVE Hot N Juicy but the few times we've been coming to the Tempe location, it's been a complete mess. The first time we came our waiter didn't greet us for 10 minutes. Then as our food was arriving a different waiter spilled our drinks and a couple seconds later realized what he did and then slowly gave us paper towels but our jeans and phones were soaked by then. No apology or anything. The manager had to come force him to apologize to us. We got over it and asked to be seated somewhere else, only because the floor was wet and messy where we were originally seated. Before we could even get comfortable, OUR waiter told us we had to move because he wants to seat someone here. At that point I was over the whole experience and told them we were leaving. I called the next day and a manager apologized for the whole thing and told us to come in and she'd give us a credit. So we went again! This time was pretty okay but we got another apology and the service wasn't so bad. The black waiter who spilled our drinks though, rudely dropped our shrimp on our table and walked away  Now fast forward to last night. My best friend has been dying to try this place! All I have to say is I will never be returning to this Hot N Juicy Location. Poor service. Poor management. Poor food."}
{"text":"I was in town for a business trip and used YELP to find this restaurant. Decided on the King Crab legs and Shrimp. Had them cooked in the garlic seasoning. The flavor and seasoning were great and cooked to perfection. I was however very disappointed in the serving size based on the price. I expected more than two legs, although they were fairly large, for the amount of crab meat versus the price paid. Probably will try some place different next time I'm in Tempe."}
{"text":"Rivals BC. Better flavor, less grease. 3 in 1 best flavor. Sausage too sweet. Corn was horrible. Will redo again even still."}
{"text":"I was afraid that I would have to wait a few hours to get into this place.  Just went here last night with a friend around 6:30pm and we were seated right away.  Awesome!  But then again, there were larger groups of people who were still waiting outside, so maybe it's a good idea to come in smaller groups!  It was also Labor Day.  We ordered the following items: 1 lb. of shrimp 1 lb. of craw fish a couple ears of corn each Sweet potato fries  and we had this in the \"mild\" hot n juicy sauce.  Boy was it NOT mild.  It was super hot!  But it was so good.  The sauce was best paired with the craw fish.  The juice from the shrimp does not take as well, but if you peel the shrimp and then plunge the entire body into the sauce in the bag, then you are good to go with the awesome hot n juicy and very garlicky flavor.  You must love butter, you must love garlic, and you must be able to handle spicy.    This place is pretty good, and comparable to Boiling Crab in the Bay Area, maybe even better in my opinion.  I have to go back and check as I've only been there once.    Not sure this would be a good date night, but I like a man who can take in some spice.  I find it very flattering!  So why not, bring your date here, see if he can pass the hot test!  You will have fun with the interactive eating, and the get down and dirty environment; bibs and all!  YUM!  I'll be back here soon, once I get this garlic and seafood smell off me for awhile.  It certainly sticks to your clothes so don't bother going out after eating here!"}
{"text":"I would love this place except we got a horrible server who's name is max I mean this guy is a slow one! Let me tell you he couldn't take a order to save his life not only that but he's rude when he speaks because of him I won't be coming back and please believe I will be letting all of social media know exactly who to NOT WATE ON YOU! Thanks max I won't be back my poor baby didn't even eat because of him! Worst customer service ever!"}
{"text":"The food was spicy and delicious! The place was lively and all the staff was friendly and helpful. Thank you for making my boyfriend's first experience here a pleasant one."}
{"text":"Love this place and love, love, love SEAFOOD!  You must like seafood to like this restaurant!  Make sure you ask for some plastic gloves when you eat the food or your hands will smell like HNJ for at least a day.    I love the food!  A little pricey but good for an occasional outing!"}
{"text":"awesome selection of flavors. i can just drinks the juice of it....yummy"}
{"text":"The excellent place to have a New Orleans style seafood!  Wish there restroom need additional stalls!"}
{"text":"Idk about this place it's good but I went with 12 people and honestly after a couple of hours I'm still hungry.  They served us bugs, shrimp, mussels, clams, snow crab, fries, calamari.  The mussels clams and crab were excellent.  The shrimp sucked the crawfish tastes just like it does when my la boys bring us some.  But considering our 12 people having a 400 dollar bill.  Not what I expected.  The service was great food over all was lacking for me.  It's a place you should try with a large group."}
{"text":"I've had this in downtown San Diego before.    If you want portion size between the crawfish and shrimp you definitely want to choose Shrimp.  They have other items on the menu like chicken wings/fingers, etc but why go there for that?  You want crawfish and shrimp!  When I meet a girl with nice nails, this is the place I like to take her because when you have the shrimp or crawfish your hands and fingers will get yummy messy!  While peeling your shrimp you can feel free to use the your table as the plate to put your shrimp skin or crawfish shell!  Wearing the bib is a must!!"}
{"text":"The shrimp and crawfish boil was excellent.  5 stars but the fried shrimp was not very good I wouldn't order it again."}
{"text":"This was my chioce for my birthday dinner last week, so that should tell you something right off the bat.  It's excellent.  Hot n Juicy is on my list of places to take out of towners.  It's sits right next to Nora's and Fierfly in my book for something, different, excting, deliciuous, fun, and affordable. It is always packed! We went Monday night at 8:30 and still had to park across the street and wait 30 minutes to be seated.  But, it's worth it.    The funny thing is, I don't even eat the crawfish. I go for the crab! The shrimp and clams are also very good.  This place is really great because you can personalize your selction.  Pick your seafood, pick your sauce, pick your level of spice.  NOTE: They are not kidding around here - SPICY MEANS SPICY.  They put all your grub in a plastic bag and serve it to you tied in a knot.  You can have them add corn, or potatoes insode as well.  I stick to 1 lb. of crab hot n juicy special medium.  I like to get corn on the cob thrown in there, plus order some sausage on the side. Rolls are a must to soak up the rest of that garlic butter infused seafood juice.  The service isn't that great but isn't that always the case for the best grub.    Strap on your bib, and get ready for your lips to burn, your nose to run, and your beer to slip out of your galicky hands."}
{"text":"First of all, let me say that I am from the Deep South so I am very familiar with crawfish. After reading the history of this restaurant on their website, I can say with confidence that Vegas is not the place to learn about crawfish. Nothing in Vegas is real. It's all imitation. Unfortunately, this restaurant follows suit. Crawfish should be boiled live and dumped on the table with new potatoes and corn mixed in. Charging additional for those items is petty. I give the flavor good marks, but I understand what others meant about the service. Our server was very friendly, but somewhat slow. I think it is because the servers pool their tips, so individual effort is not necessarily rewarded.  If the restaurant is not terribly busy, it's definitely worth stopping in and giving it a try. If you are familiar with crawfish from the south, be prepared to pay extra for sides, tell them what kind of spice level you want and try to interpret what sauce you want. That's right, I said sauce with crawfish."}
{"text":"I came to eat here with my friend and I plan on coming back as soon as possible. The food came out quick and our server Max was so sweet, fast, and very caring. I really enjoyed the service here and would love for max to be our waiter again. He even showed me how to eat a crawfish!! Thank you so much for making my experience at hot n juicy a fun one."}
{"text":"Had 1lbs of shrimp and 1lbs of crawfish both with the hot n juicy seasoning and medium spice level as well as a side of sweet potatoes. Everything was delicious and service was fantastic. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I have to say I'm shocked that in 2017 none of your seasoning sauces are gluten free and what you call \"butter\" on your menu is margarine. Are you kidding me??????? Deceptive and inexcusable. The seafood was tasty, service was slow. Asked for a fork that was never delivered. Wouldn't recommend your establishment at all"}
{"text":"I've been here so many times it isn't funny and it NEVER fails to satisfy! Amazing food, awesome service, and is a spot that any Vegas local or visitor needs to experience.   Thank you to our server Jared for taking great care of us tonight!"}
{"text":"Best oysters I've ever had ! Seriously!! I've been to other locations but this location in particular was an awesome experience. I also had a pound of shrimp and some mussels and everything was fresh and the seasoning was on point! Our server Ashley was such a sweetheart and very professional! I'm definitely going back there again! Thanks!"}
{"text":"My favorite place for seafood in Vegas PERIOD!  Like it spicy? Get their Hot n Juicy Extra Spicy. Add corn, sausage and potato to your crab or shrimp.  The shrimp is peel and eat. So don't order it if you don't want to work for it.  I love their clams in the lemon pepper flavor.  They have chicken nuggets & wings, mozzarella sticks for your non seafood eaters.  If you don't want sauce all over your hands ask for gloves. They have them :)"}
{"text":"My favorite place in town for seafood I always get 1 pound of snow crab, hot n juicy flavor and spicy. If I'm feeling brave, extra spicy. I like to add in corn, sausage and potatoes to help fill me up. A side of rice is great too.  We also like to get a pound of the clams in lemon pepper flavor and medium spicy. Just to change up the flavors.  Cajun fries are great to snack on while you wait for your bag of deliciousness.  The rolls are a great way to either cool down the heat of the spice or soak up the last of the juice in your bag.  Their Etouffee is really good too. Always temperature hot and a little spicy. It is a stew of seafood and veggies served over white rice."}
{"text":"We love coming here! Way better than Boiling crab! You get what you pay for! The customer service is awesome. We are never leave disappointed. We try to come every month. We love it here."}
{"text":"Hot n juicy is good but honestly I like boiling crab better.. The seasoning is good but it is a bit sweeter.. I don't care for the sweeter taste in my crawfish. But it's not like I was disappointed. Second choice is better than no choice!"}
{"text":"first time here, put my name down for a party of 8 and was told the wait will be roughly around 20 minute. Waited literally an hour and forty five minute. I was ready to leave after 40 minutes but since we had plan to come here weeks before and the already 40 minutes was wasted, we waited. So as we get seat, the server rushed our group to order. Seriously? What for? If we've waited an hour and forty five minutes, we're taking our time. So we order, each order comes out 5 minutes apart so we waited for everyone's order to completely come out. Oh btw, I got my food last and it took 40 minutes from the time I ordered it. Yep. By that time I was completely over it. Terrible, horrible, such bad service!! This place needs help!  1 star for the food  Earn the other 4!!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed on the quality of the food. I ordered 1/2 a dozen of oysters and they looked like the size of my boogers. I ordered 1 pound of clams and while I ate them it felt like I was crunching on rocks. Probably only ate 6 and left the rest for the trash. I ordered the crab shell pho sandwich and can I tell you, it felt dry(very little sauce and lettuce). Did I mention that I only got 3 pieces of crab shell and the rest was balls of deep fried dough. It was a waste of money."}
{"text":"The flavors are awesome! I grew up in Alaska and I've never had king crab in anything but garlic butter but now I'll never eat it in garlic butter again. The experience was great too. The only complaints I have is that the food is served in plastic bags instead of a traditional bucket or platter and there's no hard alcohol only beer and wine. I'm leaving full and happy tho and I'll for sure be back."}
{"text":"Visited this unique dining establishment about a week ago not knowing what to expect but heard and read good reviews.  Our server, Emeli, was fantastic and went well beyond the call of duty not only to take fantastic care of us, but also took the time to explain what to expect and was full of useful information on ever aspect of the menu.  Hot & Juicy should be proud to have her a member of their team!  I should mention that I have grown up in and around the ocean and I'm very familiar with seafood in every respect.  The concept of this restaurant is that the patrons are delivered the food in plastic bags, to tables that are covered with disposable table cloths.  Each diner is provided a bib and surgical gloves( for those that don't want to get their hands dirty) and each table has a roll of paper towels. If you require a shower when you're done dining is up to you.  We found the food exceptionally fresh and tasty.  There were only two of us and we ordered several items.  Shrimp, Muscles and a Dungeness Crab.  Shrimps are severed with the heads on and not cleaned.  When you eat shrimp, you need to clean and devein them.  Peeling Shrimp are quite simple but deveining them with wet hands at the table is quite impossible.   This is no way to eat shrimp and I'm sure the owners of Fresh & Juicy know this. It's obviously much more economical for the restaurant not to clean, de-head and devein the shrimp and have the customer do it.  I'm not sure if most of their customers know to do this and can remove the vein. Again, almost impossible with wet hands and no implements.  The bill for two people ............................ We had one pound of shrimp, one pound of muscles and one Dungeness Crab, and a total of four domestic beers........$92 without a 23% tip. (Again, Emeli was fantastic) We were instructed to just put all of the shells directly on the table. As dining progressed, the table looked more and more like the pigs were feeding! Sorry, but this is not my \"thing\".   I don't mind paying $92 price for fresh seafood but I personally don't enjoy dining like a pig with plastic table cloths, crab shells and shrimp shells and head,  a roll of paper towels, in an atmosphere that is more in line with a fast food establishment.  I might have a different attitude if the bill was $40 but I know this is not possible for good seafood.    The bottom line is if you want to enjoy fresh, tasty seafood, eat it like a pig and are not price sensitive, this is your place for seafood.  I know it's not a place for me.  Try it for yourself and either way, at least you can form your own opinion.  I would have given this restaurant four stars for quality, freshness and taste and now you now know the rest."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place...  So my friend Yannie has been raving about this place called Hot N Juicy.  \"Sooooo good,\" she says \"Better than boiling crab,\" she says \"You have to try it,\" she says  We were together in Vegas for New Years and decided it was time for me to try it after hearing so many good things about this place.  We ordered and the employees told us that the crawfish is frozen aka not fresh, so it's discounted, okay that's fair. So when we ordered 10lbs of shrimp for our group. Let me make a couple comparisons we can all relate to.  Plastic bottle liquor vs top shelf Soccer in America vs Football My shrimp vs fresh shrimp  My shrimp must have been the bottom of the barrel leftovers or something, but it was almost to the point of disgusting. Trying to peel the shrimp was difficult as the shrimp itself would just disintegrate and fall apart. It was like the employees packed a bunch of powder into shrimp shells and cooked it.   Highly highly disappointed in this place. The ONLY reason why I gave this an extra star is because the sauce was halfway decent."}
{"text":"I love hot n juicy so much. I've yet to cheat with the competitors.  My order is medium spiced lemon pepper shrimp with sausage. I also like their corn fritters & Cajun fries. White rice of course:] I just wanted to say this location definitely trumps the other two in the city.  I came with my coworkers after work and was HUNGRY!   90 % of the time there is a wait in the china town locations so I was so happy to be immediately seated.  The service was awesome. Everyone who came into our paths or by our tables helped us or asked us if we needed anything.  The other locations are usually super busy and service sucks and always forgets refills. It's high spice and sodium food we need refills!  If you've never been you order seafood by the pound in different spice levels and different sauces. You can add corn, sausage, and potatoes to be cooked in the sauce also. They also carry different fried food baskets like catfish and chicken nuggets.  The food comes in bags and you eat right out of the bag and leave the trash or mess on the table. There is also wine and beer at this location as I believe there is a bar you can sit at.  This isn't for everyone but I love it. Sure it sucks you and your car might smell garlicky but to ding them is silly.   I don't have much more to say. I had a stellar time here the other night. Sometimes the other location almost over boils the shrimp as the meat gets stuck to the shell but not here.   The main reason I enjoyed myself so much was the staff. We couldn't stop talking about how nice, helpful, and efficient every one was.   If I had one thing to nit pick about it was sort of lame my fries came out awhile after the shrimp but it was still the best time I've had at any location.   I'll definitely return."}
{"text":"I love hot n juicy I could eat here everyday.  So you order seafood by the lb, it is boiled in their different sauces, and then you choose a spice level. You put on a Bib and then you eat your food out of a bag and leave it all on the table. The seafood comes whole. As in the shrimp head and all. Everything is market price. They also have some baskets which are varying fried foods like catfish, chicken nuggets, fries, ect.  Tip! You can order a half lb of shrimp which is like the perfect size.   Also if you are on a low sodium diet then look elsewhere.  I always get the same thing. Lemon pepper shrimp that is mild with some sausage steamed that gets cooked with it. Then I get a side of white rice.  If I'm feeling feisty then I get a potato.  If I'm with a group then I share some corn fritters. The sweetness really is delicious with the spicy shrimp.  I've had their étouffée and Cajun fries. The étouffée was eh and the Cajun fries are good! Spicy but not too spicy.  The price here is right, if they aren't slammed (which they usually are) the servers are all really nice.  The only bad things is that their bathroom always smells. Idk if it's a sewage thing but the men's room always smells, the trash full, and the sinks don't expel much water.   Other then that the food is good and the service is usually good for what it is, and the price is also right."}
{"text":"I've been here like 3xs. I've had various items. Crawfish, fried shrimp, steamed shrimp, crablegs, spicy sausage, catfish. So yeah I've had almost the whole menu at some point. You've been to 1 of these places, you've been to them all. Crab boils in a bag. Full of spice and flavor. I always get the hot & juicy flavor & extra hot spice level. Service has always been cool too no complaints."}
{"text":"The sauce options are amazing! Love their Hot N Juicy and the Lemon Pepper. Perfect to go with a group and split orders. It was difficult wanting to stop eating."}
{"text":"We like crawfish, so we have enjoyed coming to the original Hot n Juicy in Chinatown, but it was just a little far. Pretty exciting to have one right by the house now!  I love that they serve you the food in a bag, right on the table, and that you can pick your own custom spice. The shrimp and crab legs are awesome, but the namesake crawfish are tiny - just ok. Prices are pretty reasonable and you get a ton of food. Don't wear your best shirt - it's messy!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan for sure. There aren't that many places in Vegas where you can dig into a sack of crawfish, so Hot & Juicy definitely sets themselves apart.  We had oysters, crawfish, shrimp, sweet potato fries, and chicken fingers (for the non-seafood eater). The oysters were good, nothing special. I really enjoyed the lemon pepper sauce on the shrimp. The crawfish were awesome - pretty spicy and we only got medium! I didn't try the chicken fingers, but I can imagine... Prices are reasonable, service was good, atmosphere is bustling, like it should be."}
{"text":"Came here about 1-2months back and had a fantastic server. I think her name was Allison or alli. She was very attentive and made sure our party was taken care of. She also knew the menu really well and gave great recommendations.   Food wise order 1lb of shrimp hot n juicy med w/ corn + sausage. Delicious very comparable to boiling crab if not better.  I did enjoy the variety of the menu in comparison to boiling crab they have fantastic corn fritters. Etoufee was also bomb!"}
{"text":"Wow! This is one of the best restaurants to go for in Vegas. I actually live here in las vegas but has never gone to this place until today. I can't believe I'm missing out on all this crazy goodness. This place is simply the bomb!  We got each a pound of shrimp and crawfish and man was that good. The shrimp was absolutely to die for and the crawfish is just so so. The shrimp was big and juicy and really easy to peel but the crawsfish was pretty small and hard to peel. We got garlic butter as the seasoning and it really complimented the spicyness. One thing, they take spicy seriously.. Our food had a less mild mix and I thought it was already really spicy. Can't really eat them without rice in my opinion. I recommend ordering their sausage too. It was very yummy with their garlic butter seasoning. However, get ready to wait in line before getting seated cause this place tends to get really crowded.  In other words, this place is really the sh*t!! I would go back here soon... very soon... Amazing place! go go go try this joint out!"}
{"text":"Restaurant is large in size, but lacks in quality and service. The service is slow and unattentive. We came for lunch around 3pm, and were unable to order until about 20 minutes after being seated. It proved quite a difficult task trying to attain our servers attention when we had simple requests, especially for such a large venue that was not busy at all. Compared to the Spring Mountain locations, the cajun sauce is quite runny and not as thick and rich like the other locations. They barely put any sauce on the crab legs and the crab legs still seemed a bit cold. I was highly disappointed with this location, both times I've been here! Word of advice - you'd be better off sticking to the Hot'N'Juicy locations on Spring Mountain where the food quality is remarkably phenomenal and the service is top-notch."}
{"text":"I love the crawfish here it was good! I came here many times! But when I came back at night the service sucks! Josh just sat us down and gave us drink but did even bother to come ask us if we need anything until the very end when we done eating he didn't even gave us any glove or bibs like any other customer, we usually tip $20 or more when they service is good and we are happy to give big tips but not if you don't want to service us. Sometimes it's all about the food quality but the food service counts too. You can't enjoy your food when you don't get food service."}
{"text":"I'm sorry, but too many mistakes.  I don't want to get into specifics, but needless to say I got other people's food.  They probably got mine.  Instead of leaving it on the table they took at back to the kitchen.  This is a total no-no.  Don't let customers think you are switching out food - I had already stuck my dirty fork into the one they snatched back from me and brought back to someone else within 1 minute.   I also didn't get what I ordered.  The food was average.  I decided to try this location after a horrible experince at another location of the same chain several months back.  The crawfish are especially small and impossible to eat because they break apart trying to get them out of the shell.  They really screwed up the crawfish bad.  I've eaten a lot of crawfish.  The shrimp on the other hand is top notch - sweet, wonderful texture, easy to eat.   I'll try this place again next time I save up another hundred dollar bill to afford it.  When that happens I guarantee I will not eat the crawfish.  The difference between 2 stars (Meh.  I've experienced better.) and 3 stars (A-OK) is not screwing up the orders and if you do make it right then and there.   I may add or subtract a star when I return depending on service."}
{"text":"This was my second experience with this restaurant.   The food was OK, but the service was just awful.   I can live with a place that is really low-brow in presentation.  No plates.  No spoons.  Paper cups. Food served in plastic bags served on a plastic table cloth.  No utensils were offered at all.  I had a few pounds of HotNJuicy crayfish that tasted pretty good, but were swimming in enough garlic to choke a small country.  Not that there's anything wrong with garlic.   Back to the utensils.  OK I get it.  Crayfish is something you eat with our fingers, but I'm supposed to eat boiled potatoes with my fingers?  That's too much to ask.   I'd also like to get offered the option of some sort of condiment with the crayfish.  Some cocktail sauce or melted butter would have been really nice, but despite having at least 6 waitresses in the place they barely spoke to us at all.  They just kept walking past us over and over helping other tables.  It was seriously incompetent wait service.  The person who took our order never really came back to ask us if we needed anything at all and we had to waive down somebody to bring a check and then we waited at least 10 minutes for change.    The highlight of the meal was the soft shell crab basket.  The fries were perfectly cooked and the crab was plentiful and tasty.  Well done and a descent deal at around $11.  The $11 per pound price on the crayfish was high considering that there was not really a ton of food in a whole bag full.   At the end of the meal I started noticing everyone else had a bowl of lemons and what looked like a finger bowl.  We never got and because nobody was paying any attention to us at all it was a problem,  This is really messy stuff to eat.  Your fingers get caked up with garlic and spices and paper towels simply do not handle it.  When we asked for something to wash out hands we were instructed to go to the restroom - which was actually quite nasty inside.  Dark.  Dirty.  Pretty gross actually.  All I needed was a descent wet wipe like the kind most restaurants that serve messy food offer you.  Better than that would have been a finger bowl of lemon water.  I'm sorry, but if you're going to sell people food at $20-$40  per person the least you can do is offer them a wet wipe."}
{"text":"I've eaten at plenty of places that serve pretty much the same kind of food. But this place rocked. I normally order crawfish, but they were out of louisiana crawfish, but  they had crawfish from northern California. VERY smart. They had a backup plan and they succeeded. I mean these suckers were HUGE. Mini lobsters, I'm telling you. Very fresh, flavorful, and so full of meat. Then the clams, they weren't overcooked. They were big, and dare I say it, JUICY. Yummers. Shrimp. Good. Not overcooked, easy to peel and tasted great.  And they've got a second location, which I've been to. And you can always call to see what their inventory is. And if they don't have it earlier in the day, they definitely will by dinner time. Highly highly recommended. This is the spot to go when you're in Vegas. Oh, by the way, I've been here at least 4 times in the past 8 months, and I live in California. This is always a stop."}
{"text":"This is one delayed review.  Better late than never, right?   Teri W put together a UYE and of course, we weren't going to say no.  First of all, I've been to the Spring Mountain locations before.  The food is the same, but the ambiance is totally different.  This Hot N Juicy is bigger, cleaner, and has enough TV screens to keep you occupied while you wait for your food.  If you felt cramped at the other locations, then give this H&N a shot.   I dig this H&J and as for their food, it's messy good.  Present during our dinner was Teri W, Terri R, Tracy P & Hubby, Khatherine & Boypren, Michael K, and Norm K.  We had a great time during dinner and our waitresses were efficient with handling such a big group.  Like I stated before, the food is messy good.  You can't eat here without getting food all over the place. Terri and I shared the 2 lbs of their Garlic Butter Shrimp and White Rice.  My strategy was to peel the shrimp, mix it with my white rice, and try to stay clean.  Peeling the shrimp was a slippery mess and it's a good thing I had gloves.  As for trying to be proper and eating with a fork, that didn't happen.  The garlic butter shrimp with rice was so good that I ate it Pinoy style (with my hands).  The shrimp was seasoned just right and I can't wait to give them a shot again.    TIP:  Don't wear white and use their bib.    PS:   The spice levels can be high by choice.  Ask Michael K.  He went for their hottest flavor.  I can't even imagine peeling that shrimp with no gloves and a paper cut.  Hah!"}
{"text":"This was my first crawfish experience and it was pretty yum!  We had 1lb of shrimp (hot n juicy - medium spice), 1 lb of snow crab (lemon pepper - medium spice), 1lb of shrimp (lemon pepper - medium spice), and 1lb of crawfish (hot n juicy - medium spice).  Also got beers and sweet potato fries.  The lemon peper was good on the crab but not so good on the shrimp.  Were told to go less spicy than normal because their spice was hotter than everyone else's, so we went medium.  Really wish we had gone hotter.  We also did not shake our bags, which after reading a few reviews, could have made a big difference.  Geez, aren't we smart?!?  On a Thursday night, it was super crowded, but we got the last available table, so no wait.  Service was really fast, if not overly friendly.   It seemed like we ordered and five minutes later we were opening steaming plastic bags!  Food was great, incredibly messy and I thought it was a little pricey.  Not sure if I would go back here, but it was definitely an experience.  I feel like I lived a little.  I also feel like I should share this little nugget:  The next morning, my BF says \"WHAT IS THAT SMELL?\"  It was us.  We smelled like garlic for a good three days. haha"}
{"text":"Love it...this time we skipped the crawfish (too much work) and opted for 2pounds of shrimp. Wished we had gotten one pound of shrimp and one pound of crab legs like the people seated next to us..oh well, still awesome.  We got it medium spice and Hot N'Juicy special- got the extra sauce to put on rice...OH HELL YEAH...the sauce on the rice alone was DELISH! We also got soft shell crab and chicken wings..everything was very GREAT...stuffed ourselves silly that's for sure.."}
{"text":"Gooooo, if you're in Vegas!  You won't be disappointed.  Large tables, covered for your enjoyment.  Go nuts with the seafood and crawfish."}
{"text":"First time eating crawfish, first time eating anything of this concept, so I must say it was a trip!  The service was great, the girls came by and explained everything to us. I was a little thrown off at first, because there's a disposable tablecloth right in front of you and they throw down a plastic bag of crawfish/shrimp/whatever, laden with sauce and a corn/potato/whatever thrown inside. And you just kind of dig in! Crawfish itself is kind of hard to eat, or difficult, since you go through sooo much work and the result doesn't really yield much. I'm much more of a shrimp kinda girl, but the sauce and all that licking made it worthwhile.   This place is great, would come back again. My only complaint is (that since I'm such an environmentalist) they throw EVERYTHING away, from cups to plates to forks. I mean, i get it, it's easy clean up and all. But the poor environment! Anyways, that's just my qualm. Everything else was great."}
{"text":"Kids love the place.  Personally I don't like eating out of a plastic bag, on a plastic table covering, with a plastic bib and plastic gloves.  The food is good.  I just wish there was an option to get it all in a big bowl with some utensils and another for shells.  I'm  sure the owners are loving it though.  Ship the food in without processing it, money saver!  Boil everything in one pot including your sides, little prep equals saving money!  Serve everything on and in plastic bags, no silverware, even the cups are disposable.  No dishes to purchase or clean.  And after all those savings the food is still sold at a premium prices.  When we go we usually end up paying around $30 or so a person.  Went to the new location on Eastern a couple of times and the service is not good there.  Both times the place wasn't busy and both times it was poor service.  I actually had to get up and go find someone in the back to get drink refills."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place, but it was a let down. It took us FOREVER to find it, as it is tucked away behind a shopping center. After finding it, we sat down to order, but were not greeted by a waitress for another 10 minutes. She finally gave us menus, and we ordered. Another 30 minutes passed by. Someone else delivered our food. We had not seen our waitress again, but they only delivered HALF of what we ordered. I had to get up and walk to the bar, because I STILL had not seen my waitress. I found her, let her know we were missing food and sat back down. Someone else brought the rest of our order a few minutes later. Our waitress never refilled our water, I had to ask someone else for gloves and crab crackers.   As far as flavor goes, it was meh. The crawfish was frozen and small. We ordered a pound of crab legs as well, and got 3 legs. Now, I am not a chemist or anything, but I knew that wasn't a pound.  The potatoes were cold in the center. Corn was soggy.   Overall, poor, expensive, disappointment in Vegas. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"For some reason I think Hot and Juicy Las Vegas is better than Orange County, CA. All 14 of us enjoyed all of our food."}
{"text":"Good idea i guess.   Just not for me.   Too much work to get to your food and so messy.  Glad I came to try it but prob won't be back.  Staff was nice"}
{"text":"Get the spicy hot and juicy sauce it's a must if you like spicy food"}
{"text":"Changed their decor inside, a lot brighter and seems bigger. Staff is friendly and fast, just wish she came back to refill my water. My only complaint is the mussels I ordered most of the shells were shattered, shells kind of messed up the meat. Not a really big deal but just had to be a little cautious."}
{"text":"This place is garbage. I ordered a pound of shrimp. The sauce tasted atrocious! I hope this place closes down. Prices are ridiculous. It's not worth the trip. Trust me.   Boiling Crab and Claws taste so much better than this. Don't even waste your time here. Seriously. Do yourself a favor and keep your money."}
{"text":"Server was good . King crab leg good. Oyster on half shell excellent .  Crawfish good as always"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place.  If you're a seafood fan and want to support a local restaurant that has now been shared across the country, then this is the place for you.  They are a popular place so there might be a wait, you can always call and find out or just take the risk.   I hope you don't mind eating with your hands, but offer gloves too. They are serious about their spicy levels! Being Mexican, I love spicy so be warned medium and up definitely has a kick, haven't dared to go to extra spicy yet.  Their beer selection is decent."}
{"text":"Been to places like kickin Cajun on Oahu so I figured this place would be similar which it was. Ordered two separate lbs of king crab legs and I swear they ripped me off. Not sure how one leg weighed a lb . I think it weighed a lb after they added my two potatoes and two corn cobs. The taste was just ok nothing that wowed me. But I have to admit our server was great and the staff seemed nice."}
{"text":"Overall, great experience! I have never had crawfish so I was a little scared to order but the waitress made great suggestions. The shrimp, crawfish, potatoes and sausage were amazing. Only tip is to order a spice level lower then what you want. We ordered mild and it was still pretty hot for me! And I love spicy food. But I will definitely be back here soon."}
{"text":"This restaurant caught my eye while perusing Yelp during a visit to Las Vegas. What a great meal!!  The staff was attentive from the moment I walked in the door. The food came out quickly and the seafood was fresh and hot. I ordered the medium spicy lemon pepper sauce and it had the right flavor and level of spiciness I would expect. Also tried the fried calamari appetizer and it was awesome  Even if you are staying on the Las Vegas strip go a little out of your way to try this restaurant. It's about a 15 minute bus ride so don't waste your money on a taxi as you will be spending some $$ on their menu which is a bit pricey"}
{"text":"7 pm on a Sunday night and you're out of fresh crawfish?!? Your NAMESAKE item?!?  Damned, damned disappointing. The shrimp and clams were awesome. Oysters on the half huge and tasty."}
{"text":"Came in on a Monday afternoon,  no wait and almost empty restaurant.  Yesss. Good came out quickly and was sooo good. Great place to get down and dirty with your family."}
{"text":"What can I say that hasn't already been said? This place rocks!! I will say that I'll stick with ordering Crawfish, Shrimp, and mussels.. The oysters were a little funky but the rest was delicious!! The hot and juicy sauce is the best and I regret not getting it on the shrimp... Put on the bib and prepare for Crustacean war!!!!"}
{"text":"Alex L. was my server for tonight and she was wonderful! Came back and check up every few minutes to see if we needed anything. Was very polite and friendly! The food was awesome! Everything was cooked and flavored perfectly! Keep up the good work! Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Our third time here and keeps going down hill, dined in this time , started out not having Michelob ultra got Coors and it wasn't even that cold, wife got snow crab legs which were still good but the forgot the extra piece of corn and potato she ordered which was the second sorry we heard, i had the catfish basket which came with store bought tarter sauce and also an extra piece of corn both which by the way were cold.       Had to ask for crab crackers, 3 rd sorry,  heard sorry 2 more times from table next to us ,,. Most people don't use salt or pepper but they give it you in little plastic tubs , what a waste of containers and salt and pepper. And what the hell was with that door slamming constantly. Ill be hard pressed to come back. Angry crab here I come."}
{"text":"My friends and I went off the strip just to try this place after seeing the amazing reviews. At first, we were pretty excited, little did we know, we set ourselves up for disappointment.   Is bigger always better? We had two crawfishes the size of my hand! When I cracked it opened, the meat had black lines on it. I think I just cracked open the grandpa and grandma of all crawfishes. It was pretty disturbing.   As for taste, it just does not taste that good. In our minds, we were thinking about crawfish from Boiling Crab.   Overall, we left thinking that unfortunately, Hot n Juicy Crawfish was not that hot and not that juicy."}
{"text":"Hot n Juicy is truly the best of all crab boil restaurants in Vegas and California and this location is the best. It's located in what I call \"the Pho Kim Long plaza\", on Spring Mountain.. so be prepared to fight for a parking spot!  Service here is good! Everyone is really friendly and as attentive as they can be for how busy they get. The wait is usually long af but this evening was the first time I've been sat in less than 10 minutes (jackpot!).   Since the last time I was here, they've changed up the menu.  It used to be just seafood by weight, rice/taters/fries/corn, calamari, and now there's basket combos (chicken strips, shrimp, calamari, softshell crab) and po'boys (chicken, shrimp, softshell crab, etc) which I think is nice. One thing that sucks is every time I've been here, they have NEVER had blue crabs available. Because of that, I usually just get shrimp and I get two batches of shrimp - one with the hot n juicy sauce medium or spicy and one with the lemon pepper medium or spicy.  Hot n Juicy is just one of those places everyone in Vegas loves!"}
{"text":"Found this joint only because of Yelp -- so thanks, guys!  Took my neighbor and her 13 yr old and my mother...we were prepared to get down and dirty...  Our first impression was that on a Friday night, this place should have been much busier -- it almost made us nervous -- but we soldiered on.     The four of us ordered 3 pounds of shrimp, a pound of crawfish and a half pound of sausage -- all with mild \"hot n juicy\" (which is all of their sauces combined).  Word to the wise, I was sort of bummed about ordering it mild, but we had a \"tendertongue\" with us... Maybe I'm out of fire breathing practice because we thought the mild - like others on yelp - was definitely hot enough.  First you have to peel the saucy shrimp or crawfish while it's hot out of the steamer -- but then you realize once things cool down to the touch that your tongue is still on fire.     We ordered rolls -- and that was the fun part -- sopping up all the great sauce (since they don't use newspapers on the tables, this is possible...)  We thought the shrimp was definitely better than the crawfish.  They were out of dungeness and blue crabs tonight -- altho had snow crab but we were worried about the texture -- and honestly the shrimp were really good.  The 13 year old is a shrimp-oholic...We ended up ordering another pound for him and the cajun fries for us...really good crispy fries, too.  We girls all had beers -- perfect with the shrimp -- but honestly, once you start eating, you have to keep going -- because you're so slimed, you really can't stop and drink...I'd say we easily went through a roll of paper towels.  And they cleared us up before our 2nd round of shrimp and gave us a new plastic tablecloth and fresh drinks.    Service was genuine -- a little flakey and not really clued into the real reason they were out of crab -- but...does that really matter?    Beware, it's very easy to miss if you're heading from the Strip westbound -- fortunately it's on the right hand side if you're heading west on Spring Mt before you reach Decatur.  Then the easiest way to get back to Henderson is to take Decatur back to the 215 -- another warning -- they're doing some crazy roadwork on Decatur headed south -- so be careful -- the road is badly marked, dark and nuts...  We'll definitely go back -- but this is not for the faint of heart, anyone who doesn't like to eat with their hands or has an aversion to plastic.    Our total bill came to $70 and change before tip.  but we had 4 pounds of shrimp (16 - 20s), 1/2 pound of sausage, 1 pound of crawfish, about a dozen rolls, 1 pc of corn and 1 potato, cajun fries, 5 beers and used up more wetnaps than I'm sure any table has ever before...so we thought it was completely fair.  (Naturally, we stopped at Sheridan's frozen custard on the way home...)  Fun Friday!"}
{"text":"I really like it when the restaurant staff say hello to you when you walk in to their establishment; it makes me feel welcome as a customer. The staff here do this for everyone that walks in. Even though the cashier/service counter is away from the entrance, they yell it out.   We were seated promptly near the cashier counter and ladies' restrooms. Typical setup with the plastic table cover, roll of paper towels, and bibs to keep you clean. The server was friendly, and was well informed about the menu.   We ordered Etouffe, 2 pounds of shrimp in garlic butter and Cajun flavors.   The Etouffe was sooo flavorful and fresh! There were pieces of crawfish and shrimp in it. The rice was fluffly and not soggy like you would think the soup would do to it.   The shrimp was the 30/40 size with the head one. I think they are probably from frozen but they were still good. I know it's time consuming but I wish they would have de-veined the shrimp. I'm not a fan of the black digestive tract.  I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"The wait was unbearably long, and they do not take reservations.  The food was good.  Everything was cooked perfectly.  The only problem... We ordered garlic butter / mild on everything.  And EVERYTHING was super spicy.  Personally I love spicy, however, we had children in our group.  Even the teenagers (who love spicy) were suffering.  When we asked about it, the waiter and another insisted that we got garlic butter / mild.  They really need to taste their own food!  The waiter said to try and drown it in butter and provided some additional bowls of rice... he added that to the bill BTW.  Bottom line is that this place is good, and the food tasty.  Just beware of the spicy heat.  I find it unbelievable that their \"mild\" garlic butter is in-fact super spicy-hot.  Either the waiter or cooks were smoking something..."}
{"text":"Ordered shrimp, sausage, snow crab legs & a lobster.. All in hot n spicy medium..   This place definitely worth the try.. Seasonings were really good & juicy.. A bit strong garlic taste in the hot n spicy flavour, personally like it!  The lobster we had was 1.6lbs, so it comes a bit small, especially the meat portion.. But you can tell it's fresh & good lobsters   The crab legs are probably not in the season.. Not much comment..  Shrimp is a must order!! Good price, taste, quantity(? I guess since the shells doesn't weigh much).. The meat is fresh and got elasticity   Service wise, pretty good, we only waited less than 10min for a table even the place is packed.. Didn't wait too long for the food either.. Our server (Tiffany) was very nice & attentive!"}
{"text":"I'm sure this place is always compared to the boiling crab.   OK, OK excited that there is no line able to be seated and the staff very friendly. Option to ask for gloves for the mess that one shall endure.   By comparison, The whole shabang reigns flavor. Hot n Juicy sauce, Mmm more of a garlic taste. I had a lb of Shrimp which was overcooked, and corn which was deflated... the bite had no squirt, no corn juice!   Would I be back? ...Yes! Different place, different taste."}
{"text":"Great place but the girls need more help - busy busy busy! Came in right before the rush...2pm. A few more heads and things would run smoother - still great service - still our fav HotnJuicy location."}
{"text":"Try their SHRIMP PO BOY SANDWICH and thank me later... Freaking delicious. I also love the shrimps that you have to peal yourself, I get the hot juicy seasoning. If you like catfish than the catfish basket is also good.. I gave them 3 stars instead of 5 because they have a ghetto girl working there(I think she's Asian, she look Asian) she has this snotty ghetto attitude and just walk around looking ghetto in tiny dresses while she's at work.. But love the food here and everyone else is friendly"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my dining experience at Hot N Juicy, but to be fair this is my third time here and their service is mediocre. The front hostess has a bad attitude and is dressed as if she dropped out of yoga class. The servers are all over the place and are forgetful with condiments and requests. Out of my 3 experiences Tempe is the best location to go to. The Westgate location is not up to par to what the dining experience should be at any chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Mediocre food. Got 1 lb of shrimp with 1/2 a lb of sausage and 2 potatoes mild..wasn't as spicy as the server said everything was. Granted it has flavor but the spice lacked. The rice was hard like it had been sitting in the rice cooker for a while. Cajun fries were good but everything else was just eh."}
{"text":"Best place to eat in Vegas! We come here every time were in Vegas. Reasonably priced and worth the money!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat at, I mostly order to go and they always have my food exactly how I want it and fast. I get the shrimp hot and juicy sauce baby spice with side of rice. It's amazing. Beware it's super addictive! My #1 place for when I want something yummy to eat."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time yesterday. We ordered a pound of crawfish with sausage and corn (hot n juicy mild), a pound of shrimp (garlic butter), sweet potato fries, a bowl of étouffée and Cajun calamari. The food was awesome except for the fried calamari. It was overlooked and bland. But everything else was amazing! All in all, it was fun, great atmosphere, good music, excellent service, decent prices and amazing food. We will be back."}
{"text":"Well I had high expectations being that I'd heard about this place on Man vs. Food and was already a big fan of The Boiling Crab.  The biggest disappointment about my visit to Hot N Juicy was the service.  There were plenty of empty tables around 1pm but we stood at the door for quite a while before we were seated. Then after we were seated, we waited quite a bit longer before we placed our order.  The food came out slowly and so did the check.  In addition, the food was OK but I definitely prefer Boiling Crab and I'm glad that's the one near me!  I gotta say I was let down a bit by this place. The crawfish didn't have that sweet taste that I'm used to at BC and the rice was crispy and undercooked. Maybe it was an off day but I think I'll try some other places next time I've in Sin City."}
{"text":"This is my go-to spot! I have to have hot and juicy every other weekend and I love how the flavor at this location is better than the rest locations in town. I always enjoy some good food with good friends and best service here! Lemon always take care of our table and made our dining experience even better! Will always coming here for more amazing seafood!"}
{"text":"Service was awesome! Good drink selection and prices comparable to Angry Crab. Flavor was so-so. It was good because we were hungry. But if I had a choice, I'd choose AC"}
{"text":"If you can get over working super hard for about half a bite of food, then you'll love it here!   The seasoning is amazing and it's no wonder why that's what they specialize in. Their seafood is fresh, but you have to get down and dirty and indulge in some fingerlicking good crawfish. It'll require some work, but once you get down to the juicy pieces of meat, you'll feel so accomplished.   We also had the shrimp and they were some huge pieces of shrimp. Everything is seasoned so well and everything really is Hot N Juicy!"}
{"text":"This place is good, so good the service is rude. The host can't do the one thing she's supposed to do, greet the customers."}
{"text":"the catfish was very good as was the fried calamari but a 40 minute was just too long. I was told that the normal wait time is 35 - 40 minutes....wish i had know that AHEAD of time!"}
{"text":"I am torn on this Hot N Juicy...  My first experience here was amazing, great service, great drinks and amazing food.  I couldn't compliment this experience enough, I was crazy excited to come back and have a similar experience.    My second... not so much.  The service was still great, the drinks were still great.  The food... bland. Lack flavor and wasn't spicy like I ordered it to be.  It was Hot but definitely not JUICY this time.  It was a night and day comparison from what I had experienced just weeks before.    There was no consistency in the food from the two experiences.    I doubt I will return for a while."}
{"text":"I've tried two other places but they can't beat how much flavor Hot n Juicy has to offer in the sauces they use on their seafood. I definitely recommend getting the shrimp since it has more \"meat\" for the pound rather than all shell but if you're willing to spend the extra bucks for the other shelled fish. Why not? Any seasoning you get has so much flavor. Definitely get the \"Hot n Juicy\" flavor even without spice it's good. Lemon Pepper & Garlic Butter is delicious too. They also offer delicious calamari.  I'll definitely be back here over and over again."}
{"text":"Love love love the crawfish, shrimp, muscles, clams, oysters, and Cajun fries!!! I always get the hot an juicy flavoring and medium spice. There has been a few times the crawfish were tiny but that's normal when off season. The Henderson  location is very nice and open and seems to be quick seating"}
{"text":"I am very upset to give this location a 2 stars. I absolutely love HNJ Crawfish and have been going since the day it's opened. My visit here yesterday was not good, I ordered Cajun fries and when I got them they were such a small order, about half the size (in amount) they have been for years. I ordered all my food in hot n juicy medium sauce and when I got it the sauce was as thin as water. It used to be thicker and would coat your food, it was delicious. Unfortunately with the extremely thin sauce it didn't coat anything and wasn't as flavorful. The crawfish was over cooked and the 2 lbs of clam was more shells than clams. If this were my first experience here, I'd never return. This has happened a few times at this original location. The waitress was also very annoying trying to take my fries away when I wasn't even done with them, she did this 3 times, I practically had to shove the rest in my mouth so I didn't have to tell her not to take the basket again. She also forget to get my drink and I had to go to the register and ask someone else if they could get my drink. When I asked the waitress why the food has changed and she was rude and said she didn't know and maybe it happened with a new chef and gave me a dirty look. This was a very disappointing  trip."}
{"text":"Thanks again for not serving food at the bar. I was by myself and really did not want to sit at a table alone. Will never set foot in your \"restaurant \" again. That's for making me feel like crap traveling by myself."}
{"text":"Similar to Boiling Crab, but a little different.  I cannot say either one is better than the other since they are pretty similar.  Both restaurants are delicious.  The difference I noticed was that Boiling Crab's seasoning has more garlic.  Hot and Juicy has soft shelled blue crab with fries; I do not think Boiling Crab has that."}
{"text":"Food great, the raw oysters were great but unfortunately the waitress we had wasn't. The other service staff was friendly and helpful but we just got a bad server. She only checked on us once and that was after we had to get her attention. The other servers were more attentive. We got one drink refill and we wanted to order more but when she finally check with us a 2nd time it was to give us the check"}
{"text":"The flavor is soooo beyond delicious here its spot on!  We did have about a 30 minute wait it was packed but it was for sure worth it! A must go when in Vegas! I wish they had one out here in cali lol the flavors are definitely wayy better than the boiling crab and firehouse crawfish which we have here...i got mild spice and hot and juicy flavoring which is all the flavors combined and ughhh my mouth is watering thinking about it...the snow crab was meaty and sweet and the shrimp were also delicious. One of my friends got the black mussels and and one the crawfish and they were very good too...i dont think you can go wrong with anything on the menu!"}
{"text":"I had been driving by this place all week long and noticed crowds of people waiting here in the evenings so I figured I give this place a try.   I lucked out for a Thursday evening I only waited only around ten minutes to be seated.   I ordered one pound of Hot and spicy Crawfish, one pound of the garlic butter shrimp, and a side of corn on the cob.   The seafood was so tasty fresh and juicy, I ordered mild and it had just the right kick to get you all hot and flustered. The Crawfish were decent sized with a great tasting sauce and the large sized shrimp with heads were awesome tasting. The side of corn was really yummy cus they put garlic butter sauce on - and it's was sweet and delicious.   The restaurant is really casual and I noticed they do a great take out business also. I would really recommend this place especially if your into eating with your hands and getting dirty with your food."}
{"text":"Well I survived the mud bug experience and have to admit I enjoyed lunch. We ordered 1 lbs. of crawfish (mild/ hot&juicy) along with 1 lbs. garlic butter clams..Yummo for the first time.   Jordan, our server, was pleasant and shook her head \"no\" when I told her I even sucked the heads.  Price wise, it's not bad. For two of us with 1 lbs. each noted above, plus two corn, potatoes, Michelob ultra and a root beer cost under $40, reasonable price in my opinion.  If you've never tried a mud big, be adventurous and hit up Hot n Juicy Crawfish for some Southern flare and flavor. Oh, and don't knock sucking the head of one until you try it."}
{"text":"We had fun and enjoyed the meal. The prices were reasonable and our server Mark was very helpful and friendly. As far as crawfish go, I thought the flavor was pretty good, but the crawfish themselves were mostly pretty small. Still, not bad for the middle of the desert. I'll definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Wonderful food and service. Our son had a blast peeling his shrimp  the shrimp was amazing and the seasoning was perfect"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!! I'm so thankful my friend told me about it... I got 1 lb. of shrimp with the hottest seasoning there was available I believe it was cajun and the corn drenched in the seasoning was SO delicious!!! I got salt & pepper, squeezed lemon juice and dipped my shrimp in it and ahhhhh enjoyed it to the fullest so good I had to order another lb. of shrimp lol.... Thankfully our wait wasn't bad we were seated right away but I did notice a little after there was a line of people waiting.. Service was GREAT. The waitress was friendly, helpful & informative. Prices were good for 1 lb. of shrimp about $10, sides such as corn or rice i want to say were $2... Overall a GREAT experience and can't wait for the W. Hollywood location to open since it's closer to me... You have to try HOT & JUICY CRAWFISH!!!"}
{"text":"I think i like this chinatown location better than one in Decatur. It's more Hip.  Service is good.  Everytime me and my fiancé go there, we always order same stuff.  2lbs of Hot n Juice shrimp, one sweet potato fries, 2 bowls of rice and two corns. And trust me we always finish everything. Their signature sauce is amazing.  I love this place."}
{"text":"It was my first time dining at this place and I must say that everything was spectacular! The beautiful server that took care of us was Loren. Too bad her cakes weren't on the menu because they would be sold out. Her customer service was amazing. She was very attentive to the table and knew what she was doing. Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"fortunately, both times I've been here, we beat the crowds... the wait can get pretty long, if its crowded.   the food here is good. i'd say its on par with boiling crab. we got the hot n juicy special. tried both spicy and very spicy. very spicy is not as killer as they hype it up to be, but the heat does build up over time.   minus one star for sometimes slow service."}
{"text":"I think the food was good and the service was better than good. I think my review comes down to how messy the food is and much you have to work to get to it. I will prob try this place again but I am not sure if it is really that special. If you love seafood and working to eat it than this might just be your place. If you are not a big seafood fan than I think you might think about this place the same as I did.   I had crawfish, shrimp and crab. I enjoyed two out of the three, though there was a lot of work getting the crawfish and the crab as to be expexted I guess. I enjoyed the shrimp most which I ordered medium with sausage, corn and potatoes. If I come back here again this is what I will be ordering.   Overall for me just an ok place to eat. Prob a little over hyped."}
{"text":"It was our first time eating here and our server Camille was very informative on ordering. And the food itself was incredible!"}
{"text":"King crab legs were great but the place leaves you smelling so bad that its not worth it."}
{"text":"I was a little mad at my wife for going here with her mom first instead of me. We had just talked about going here the other day and she goes with her? I mean I love my mom to, but come on we JUST said we should go! Anyway, enough about my thoughts about my wife and lets get to my thoughts on Crawfish. We went here in the middle of the day so it wasnt that busy which was nice because we got a table right away and got the full attention of the staff. Everyone that came to our table was very nice and joked around with us so no complaints there. I dont like the Outback way of pricing which is charging for every little thing on the menu. You want fries? Boom! 3 bucks! You want butter? Boom! 2 bucks! Bread? Hahaha! If you have to ask you cant afford it. I mean I cant atleast get some fries with my shrimp or atleast 2 rolls with my crab? Its a very annoying practice that might be the main reason I will never go back. The shrimp we ordered was good and I actually liked taking the shell off myself and that goes the same for the crab. I also ordered the calamari, but for 10.99 a basket I would not recommend it. What I can about my trip is the staff was friendly, but the food and sides are expensive, plus dont go with a woman who likes to go places without you......."}
{"text":"It was HOT, it was JUICY, it was downright MESSY.  And we enjoyed every minute of it!!!  Off of spring mountain, across from Vegas' chinatown is this super casual sport bar'ish spot.  We saw them on Man vs Food and we just HAD to try it.  Looked soooo good on tv!!!  And they didnt disappoint :)  Pick a seafood (Raw Oysters 1/2 Dozen/ Dozen, Dungeness Crab (Seasonal), Blue Crab (Seasonal), King Crab, Snow Crab Legs, Lobster, Clams, Shrimp, Crawfish) then pick a seasoning (Louisiana Style, Juicy Cajun, Garlic Butter, Lemon Pepper, Hot N Juicy Special), how many lbs and pick how HOT you want it!!  This all comes out to you in huge clear plastic bags and you've got a nice roll of paper towels on the butcher paper covered table to keep yourself somewhat 'clean'.  Oh ya, take the bib and ask for gloves (we didnt know about the gloves....)  *Hot and Juicy special crawfish (1lb HOT): my fave, savory hot and juicy.  Totally garlicky and enough spice to really plump up your lips.  You're sweating and maybe even getting a runny nose...but who cares...it's soooo good! Always dunk in the sauce before eating. YUM! *Garlic butter crawfish (1 lb HOT): even MORE garlic, really buttery and HOT.  I found this to be pretty salty too but fiance loved it. *Cajun shrimp (1lb HOT): really meaty, plump n juicy fresh shrimp.  once you peel be sure to dip the meat in the sauce...mmm *Sweet potato fries: super crisp (crispiest sweet potato fries i've ever had) altho the sweet potato flavor didnt seem as strong.  Great vehicle for MORE sauce! mmm also helps in putting out \"some\" of the fire going on in your mouth  mmm crawfish....we really need this spot in nyc!!!"}
{"text":"Still hot and still juicy!!! Tried the original location this time and wasnt disappointed altho I feel as if the other one is more garlicky altho this one you end up smelling more so? Does that make sense??? My purse smelled like garlic for days!!! So beware!  Fiance was totally disappointed they were out of dungeness crab the night we went...booo So he made do with crawfish (quite big this time) and shrimp.  Our friend got the King crab legs altho the waitress quoted her the wrong  price for it so that was NOT a pleasant surprise at checkout.  We tried the etouffe this time and that is super buttery.  It's got good flavor and helps fill you up since it all sits on a bed of rice.  Next time we have to compare to Boiling Crab... :p"}
{"text":"Pretty good seafood.  It was a unique experience for me.  It's kind of like an informal picnic setup.  Food came out when it was ready instead of all at once.  It was fun to try all the different seasonings and sauces they offer, but beware because when they mean \"hot\" it's \"hot\".  I really liked the soft shell crab basket.  Shrimp is very large!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places! My boyfriend and I come here at least twice a month. And, we are never disappointed. We always order the following:   1) Corn Fritters: Deep fried creamy corn nuggets with ranch sauce. We literally crave this for days after we leave.   2)  Snow Crab: We get three different sauces. I recommend the Hot-N-Juicy sauce because it's a blend with all of the other sauces. Definitely has a great flavor to it.   3) Sausage and Corn: We throw these into the bag with the Hot-N-Juicy sauce. I've been told by those that don't like spicy that the sausage is spicy. However, I love spicy, so I think it's relatively mild.   We also order beer and sides like rice and extra butter, but those are the main things.   We ordered the crawfish and shrimp once, but I am not sure if the work is worth it. I'd much rather put the effort into crab.   Just be aware, you'll reek of garlic and be prepared to get messy! I always go no-gloves because it's just easier to get all the meat out of the shells that way.   It's always busy in here. I wish they stayed open later. They also have TVs all around, so it is great for watching the games.   The service is usually good. There have been a few times it has been sub-par, but that might be because there isn't just one dedicated server to each table. They're all helping every table.  Oh, the only thing I would say is... don't order the oysters. They aren't very good. I love oysters, but these didn't taste fresh at all. There was also very little meat to them. I usually eat a dozen oysters by myself, but I didn't want to even finish my half-dozen. Oh, and maybe also avoid the desserts. We had a brownie thing once and it wasn't good. Walk next door to the gelato place instead!  Go with the snow crab. You won't be disappointed.  Love this place. Favorite Cajun crab joint in town (and I've tried all of them)!"}
{"text":"it's good--but definitely not as good as boiling crab. plus maybe it was just the waitress we had but service really sucked and our waitress gave us attitude and kept messing up our order."}
{"text":"Their Cajan Fries are the best in town. I have had different ones like Bowling Crab and these are better. The difference to me with Hot N Juicy and Bowling Crab is the amont of butter they use. You can tell Hot N Juicy has more of sweetness in their flavor when the bag of shrimp comes out. Bowling Crab is different in a way that they have more butter added to the bag. So it really depends on the type of person you are and how you like your food to be served. This is a great place to get some seafood and have some fun with your hands."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite restaurant in Vegas. I love quality of seafood and the price. I'm not much for crawfish, so I always get the crab and I've never been disappointed. The shrimp is served with the heads still on and is absolutely the most tasty, fresh and juicy that I've ever had. Most dishes are served straight from boil bag and you discard the shells directly on the plastic covered tables. A pound of shrimp, snow crab, 2 pieces of corn and two heineken light for $36, a meal that can't be beat."}
{"text":"The staff here at this location is horrible. We visited this location at a suggestion of a friend, who loved the Las Vegas location and we were all disappointed. We were sat, the waitress didn't know the menu item when we asked about certain beverages. The table who was sat next to us after we were had their food delivered ( a large order that included the same items we had ordered) before we had ours. When we were offered refills we had to open our lids to the plastic, refillable take out style cups with our messy hands and that was ridiculous.  I hope this chain of restaurants gets a better staff at this location."}
{"text":"Wonderful service and enjoy the 4810 Spring Mountain location very much. Lemonade has served me both times I have been here and she is just simply amazing and attentive. Cannot speak well enough for the seafood they serve here, and the sauce is some of the best I have ever had. #hotnjuicy4life"}
{"text":"We ve been here so many times and the service is getting worse and worse . We ordered rice, it came out ice cold after 10 mins waiting , the waiter brought it back  second time the same thing ! Steam rice supposed to be\"hot\" steamy  hello ! The waiters explained to us the cook did not know the rice cooker didn't keep warm ? It'd take awhile to make the rice what ??? Really ?? Can we just microwave it ? Dumbest thing ever ! Never retiurn"}
{"text":"I love hot n juicy and I get it every time that I go to Vegas. What I like about this location is that every time that I have gone, it's easy to get seats. It's still pretty busy but I haven't had to wait in line...yet.   I always get a 1/2 pound of shrimp, a corn, and potato with the hot and juicy sauce and medium spice. I went here recently and the medium wasn't too spicy, but I feel like I have had it spicier here. I love the flavors here. The crab is delicious as well and so are the french fries. When you have a lot of sauce, you got to have rice. I can just eat the sauce and rice on it's own. That's how much I like the sauce!  Service is standard, they're usually running back and forth so they're busy. There is a small parking lot you can park in or do street parking. Until next time hot n juicy!"}
{"text":"YOU FUCKING OWN The Boiling Crab! Haha. I had this the same week I had boiling crab and I totally noticed the difference. OMG, the sauce here is AMAZING. I usually just order the shrimp-- sooo goood. And don't forget to order a side of sweet potato fries!!! MMM MMM! Not a fan of crawfish even though that's what the restaurant is known for. Funny thing, I saw this place on Man vs. Food-- the owner is Asian, yet the food is Cajun/Creole...HMM. OH WELLS- it's still AMAZING!"}
{"text":"This is a must for my sisters and I.  We try to make it while we are in Vegas.  We always order the Cajun (mild) Shrimp, Clams, and Crawfish.  The oysters are fresh and delicious, so delicious that I want to lick the whole shell! LOL We leave the carbs out so we don't get too full.  The food is great and the staff very friendly.   If you want a place out of the ordinary buffets and expensive burgers, stop by and have some crawfish! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The first time we went GREAT! Fantastic food, extra sauce in our bags of food, hot and steamy, and great customer service. However: the second time around was a completely different story. The biggest flaw I noticed this time of the infamous Hot N Juicy establishment was no so much their servers, waitresses, nor the quality of the food. It is their communication. My goodness I ordered 2lbs of crayfish and 1lb of snow crab legs and it literally took half an hour JUST for the snow crabs to come out. Actually, one of the other table's waitress initially gave our crab legs to a nearby table. Then our waiter came over and had to take it to our table while the waitress walked away oblivious to the situation. And on the crawfish, it never even came out. Customers that walked in after us already had their full orders and ready to pay the bill while my table was still waiting for a simple order of crawfish. We cancelled the order and was displeased. It seems the servers do not communicate with one another since we never got our crawfish and it seems the cooks were having a party in the back since the orders took forever."}
{"text":"Coming from Los Angeles, California, there's many restaurants of this style. So I've had plenty to compare from. Many LA residents know of THE BOILING CRAB.... This place, I can honestly say tops it! The flavor their shrimp has is very balance NOT overwhelming! I always have shrimp of the all mixed flavors, so this place is definitely a place I'll be coming back to for Cajun style sea food! It would have been 5 stars but I feel their service can improve. Time I was here wasn't so busy so there shouldn't be an excuse for poor service. Now it was horrible service but could've been better. Definitely try the PURPLE HAZE beer with Cajun food, being that Cajun comes from Louisiana and purple haze is a Louisiana beer it just goes perfect together."}
{"text":"This joint is TOO  BOMB.. Get the corn.. hot n juicy sauce in mild.. service was great and way worth the wait"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  And crazy busy from the moment it opens up so get there early!  Just a tip...mild is fricken spicy!  Like my lips are on fire spicy."}
{"text":"Hot N juicy, Las Vegas Strip.  Restaurant or club? The new location serves up good food but thinks it's a hip hop club on the strip. What a way to ruin the good reputation this restaurants other two locations have built up. We had shrimp, crab and catfish. Nothing to complain about with the food.  The service was good.  I asked the server if they could turn the music down and they did but it fluctuated thereafter. Not a pleasing environment to enjoy dinner. The rapping hip hop, stole the show. It's not even a pleasant R & B but straight up hip hop. Now I know why they were not close to full on a Saturday night with no wait.  The food remains good but unless you want to eat at a hip hop /restaurant club stay away from this Las Vegas strip location and hit the original. If that's your thing, by all means, be sure to visit. If you have a family avoid this location at all cost. This location may want to try an island or top 40 vibe as that music may be more appropriate and more family friendly.. Just something more soothing. I spoke with our server later and they agreed but the owners obviously think this club environment is the way to go. I noticed the servers were having a hard time hearing as much as the customers. Club or Restaurant? What does Hot N Juicy want to be? We chose the wrong location this time. It want happen again. Very disappointing especially for the price."}
{"text":"Yowzer!!!! I think kitchen made a mistake when they served us a DEFCON 5 spicy crawfish. My brother was sweating profusely across the table. As if the 2 lbs of crawfish weren't enough, we saved the corn on the cob for last. Soaking with crawfish's juice, we took 2 bites and almost fell off our chairs. For the record, we ordered DEFCON 4 crawfish which I had plenty of time before.   I thought of Grace K.'s review of Wingstop (http://www.yelp.com/user_details_review_search?q=hot+wings&userid=_pIG1_s6Bzymn1zeyLjBHQ) and couldn't decide whether to laugh or to cry. I decided on both and barely managed to keep the car straight driving home.  Mace to the face, eh!!!  This place is the food equivalent of Golf. You pay for as much of the abuse as you can take.   Excellent specialty food and attentive service. Highly recommended!!!  =)"}
{"text":"Where do I begin.. I stopped in this Downtown Tempe location on a business trip and was very disappointed.When I get there there is only one other table seated which should be great from a service perspective. I place my order and now it's a waiting game. I ordered fried calamari..it comes out several minutes later and it was cold. Why?? You aren't busy. Next I ordered the soft shell crab and sweet potato fries. The menu indicates it's 8 but that's a big lie. It's more like 2-3 that they've cut into 8 pieces. Not at all worth the price. Then they throw them on top of a bed of soggy fries. Which again were cold. I don't understand. Needless to say I was over it. My waitress was nice enough to ask if I wanted something else but at this point I just wanted to pay my bill and leave which I did. I would not return nor recommend to others."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in vegas when I need something spicy. I always go for the shrimp h&j sauce in medium. Lemon pepper sauce is great too. Also the corn fritters are the best appetizer!!! Can't get enough of this place. Don't forget the gloves otherwise you'll smell like garlic  for at least 24 hours lol."}
{"text":"Delicious and affordable seafood. Only con is the veggies cost a bit. $0.75 for half a corn or one piece of baby potato. Worth a visit again for seafood lovers.   I love the Louisiana style seasoning in medium. Any hotter I won't be able to taste anything. I don't recommend their fries. Just average fries."}
{"text":"I was excited about Dungeness Crab, but when we arrived our server informed us that they were out of it! I went with a pound of the Snow Crab in  Medium spiced Hot 'N Juicy and it was very flavorful and spicy but not overwhelming. It was only about one cluster so that will not fill you up. To make it a meal I added the fried shrimp basket and chose Cajun fries. The shrimp were so delicious and big! Those fries are super tasty and they are really Cajun it made my nose run a little. Definitely worth the hype. I'll visit every time I come to Vegas. Big flavors!!"}
{"text":"2 dollar beers for St. Pattys! The clams were amazing in the hot n juicy sauce medium spicy. I also like that they cut their sausage thinner so you can get even more flavor on them! Just make sure you eat this when you have plenty of relaxation time the day after or you'll regret it."}
{"text":"Given just a 1 star for this particular location is for the sake of it's name. Other than that, I would gladly had given a zero if I could. The other two locations on Spring Mountain are well rated because staff that actually acknowledged their customers. Unlike this location.   Was the very first time for my family and I to come here because of distance, so we decided to come here. Came inside, no wait at all, no one greeted us, waited at the door for a good 7 mins, then sat us. Took our order after 10 mins, waiter didn't give us any specials, what they didn't have, what wasn't in season etc... Ordered 3lbs of Hot n Juicy seasoned shrimp mild and 1lbs of Crawfish with same seasoning. Order didn't come out till 30 mins later, without any lemons or butter, not even the salt and pepper. We basically had to ask for everything that was already supposed to be with our orders. Orders of food that wasn't ours kept coming to our table, waiters were confused and didn't know which orders belonged to what table.   Ripped into the bag of shrimp, which was over cooked, but was tasty and little spicy. Ripped into the crawfish and the bag only had 2 big pieces and the rest were about a size of a quarter some even smaller believe it or not. Then asked the server if they had bigger ones they can change for me or exchange it with shrimp instead. She then said \"oh they're not in season\" which she was supposed to mention before we ordered (pass visits in other location) also with Boiling Crab. If she had mentioned that the crawfish was out of season, then obviously we wouldn't have gotten that.   Waiter then asked a fellow co worker (man waiter) on what to do. He came to our table And told us, there's nothing we can do, you can order what you want with the same charges that's on the menu or take it off the bill (very rude). So not only did we wait a while for our food, being the fact that my kids were hungry, they didn't acknowledge or take care of their customer needs by exchanging what we wanted since it was wrong on their end.   At this point I was already furious and wanted to leave, I then asked for the check right away, ruined our whole dinner, and they even forgot to get my check, so I went up to the register waited for them to print out my check, and they also charged me for extra butter and rice that I didn't ask for, but I still paid it, money wasn't the problem on my end. While I was waiting at the register, two customers got up from their seats and asked for hot sauce, forks and spoons. That shows lack of customer service. Something has to be done. Perhaps a more thorough customer service education? I would rather drive the miles than to come back to this place. I WILL NEVER COME BACK HERE. I will stick to Boiling Crab. Happy New Year!"}
{"text":"BTW! I failed to mention that one of the servers was super amazing. She was the brunette and I think she was featured on the Travel Channel. She was so helpful and nice!  But then we got this awful blond girl who help the other side of our table. She was so rude. We asked for more Blue Moon and instead of having it already poured in the glass like we FIRST got it, she just gave my friend the bottle and was like \"Do it yourself.\" This girl NEEDS TO GO."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The food is beyond great, as well as the pricing for the seafood as well. The seafood is a little spicy even with the baby spice, but its still worth it. Even when i cant sit down and eat i always make a to go order, because i love it that moment. The staff is always nice. The only thing is that the food might take a while to come out however its worth the wait"}
{"text":"If you haven't had real crawfish and seafood from the south, you might enjoy.  If you have, then you'll be disappointed.   They seem to cook their seafood in plain water ( no seasoning) and then put sauce on top of the shells by shaking it in a bag of sauce.  After you peel the shell off, there's not a lot of taste on the meat.   Not the way we do it in the south for sure.   Thumbs down"}
{"text":"Hot n Juicy over Boiling Crab, all day everyday! The food here never disappoints and what I love most about this restaurant is their sauce - thick, garlicky, buttery, spicy sauce. I ALWAYS get their shrimp (its head-on) and the size is perfect. Unfortunately the cost of seafood continues to rise every time I come here. I get it, the price of seafood fluctuates due to market price but I can go to an Asian store, get the same shrimp and make my own clam bake for 1/3 of the price. The only reason I give it 4 stars is because we tend to wait FOREVER for our food, never fails. They give you the rice way in advance that by the time the food is actually served, the rice is cold and has formed a hard layer on the top. Those frustrations aside, the food is on point."}
{"text":"Oh boy get ready to dig In bags of goodness. Great sea food and seasonings you can pick your own heat level."}
{"text":"This is probably the best crawfish/cajuin joint I've ever been to. I'm from the bay area and I thought that Boiling Crab might compare but it does NOT! This place is fire (the whole shabang spicy)! The flavor is great, the quality is fresh and the customer service is also good. Special thanks to our waitress and waitor, Ashley and Jeff. Definitely my new go to place on the strip!"}
{"text":"Hot and juicy was really good, my wife and I had the hot n juicy sauce mild and as a chilli lover I can say it still had a small kick. We ordered the shrimp crawfish and clams which was more then enough for the two of us. The seafood was cooked perfectly and the staff were very attentive.   Watch out if you don't want garlic breath!!!  The place is fully wheelchair accessible and has accessible toilets for both males and females but no assistance toilet."}
{"text":"In my to go order, (2 lbs clam, 2lbs shrimp and 2 lbs crawfish). I found two stones(6 oz almost) in the clam bag. Crawfish is not fresh at all. Shrimp is not bad. I ate hot n juicy many times in different city. This time is not a good experience."}
{"text":"ok..if you DO NOT like seafood, DO NOT go here.. It smells.... It's like watching people who have never seen food before..EVERYTHING IS WITH YOUR HANDS..SUPER MESSY! ALL their food INCLUDING the cheese sticks and corn on the cobb are MADE IN SEAFOOD spices!!! YES including the kids chicken nuggets..it ALL tastes like FISH!!  I left there and my entire outfit smelled of fish/seafood/crawfish/shrimp/crabs...and my hair...ugg took me 2 days to get the smell gone...  My family enjoyed the food, portions seemed reasonable...but again IF YOU DO NOT LIKE SEAFOOD, the look, the smell or the taste..DO NOT GO THERE!!!!!!!!  I do have to point out..my waiter was awesome and apologized...told me where I could get chicken and bring it in the restaurant, but the smell killed my appetite..that's ok..I don't need to eat anyways!"}
{"text":"i think the food here is excellent. the service is amazing, but 50% of the time they dont have crawfish =("}
{"text":"We're from Texas where the crawfish are always fresh and amazing. So seeing as how Hot and Juicy is so popular and reviews say it's soooo \"amazing\", we decided to stop in before hitting the road to Cali. Their crawfish was $11.99 a lb, and nowhere on the menu did it state that the crawfish came frozen. If we knew I would've never ordered it. We ordered 10 lbs and although the sauces/seasonings were good, the meat was so tough. I was so upset when it came and the sticker on the bag said \"Frozen\". Took them forever to seat us, forever to take our Order and the waitresses all had attitude and were short. Im usually really passive and patient when eating out because I used to waitress and still work in the service industry, but for such a \"famous\" restaurant, our experience sucked. I gave them 3 stars because the crab and lobster was good and so was the seasoning. We had to walk up to ask for extra bowls and spoons and even our check AND TO PAY, you'd think seeing as how we were the biggest party and our tab was $300 they'd somewhat cater to our needs, nope."}
{"text":"I've been here only once and it was great. It wasn't busy, we were seated quickly and the food was out quickly also. I ordered a pound of shrimp hot in juicy style. It was delicious.  The staff was very friendly and helpful. They even made suggestions of their favorite dishes. I will definitely be coming here again."}
{"text":"First trip to Hot & Juicy yesterday, after a failed attempt to get here on my virgin trip to Vegas back in April.  Boy, was it GOOD.  It reminded me of alot of the crawfish places in Houston - plastic table covering and a roll of paper towels included.  They were on point with the seasoning and the 'heat' of the food.  Bae ordered Fried Shrimp basket, with an order of catfish...cornmeal batter.  not thick, not dry; I had an order of Crab legs (Lemon butter/Hot) , and a order of shrimp (H&J mix/Hot). and an order of corn fritters.  The food is brought to you in bags....sold by the pound.  Everything was super good...I really liked the lil corn balls....They were just as described to me - fried cream corn...which was AWESOME SAUCE!!!.  They made me happy inside...they gave me life.  All of the seafood was seasoned to the core.  The only thing I didn't like was that the shrimp were still completely whole....head, eyes, poop-shoot, antennas, legs.... everything - so that was kinda icky....  I don't like having to clean my food before I eat it...I want it to go straight from the plate/bag to my mouth....but, I was a big girl and ripped those heads right on off. I had to request a bucket tho...apparently those do not come automatically to the table....I just can't have those black lil beatty eyes staring back at me while I consume their bodies...Food makes me emotional...but I refuse to feel guilt from a shrimp, damnit!!!!!   The shrimp shells kinda stuck to the meat, so it was hard to get off, and the meat was kinda chewy on a few....but overall - everything was GREAT and Tasty!!  Altho I felt like I was in a strip club, or Raisins on South Park, with the waitress calling everybody - \"Sweetie\" - The service was wonderful.  She was really nice, and efficient.  The drinking water was kinda gross, so I drank my tasty iced tea!  The bathroom was clean, and I liked that they give you numerous pairs of plastic gloves and the bib at the table...Seafood juices will be flyin'!!!! ...And, no one wants to leave out smelling like a yeast infection......  This was a dining success....I definitely hope to return on my next visit to LV!  I want to try the corn, potatoes, and sausage!  We ubered there -  but if you have a car....BEWARE - their parking lot is EXTREMELY small and very hard to get in and out of if there is any type of crowd."}
{"text":"It was a concert night so every where was packed. Went for a new spot because they had open seating. Service was very unhelpful. The smell is awful! The only good thing was 1lb of shrimp is a good amount. I won't be back though."}
{"text":"So good we came here twice the same weekend we was in Vegas. And I almost didn't want to come because I been to the one in AZ and it was just OK to me. But this location was sooooo good. The first spot we came as soon as we landed. The flavor of our shrimp and crawfish was soooo good. We need one of these in Nashville!"}
{"text":"I eat crawfish here every time I go to Vegas. Try the spiciest sauce. It is to die for. Girls remind me of hooter girls lol, young w tight clothes. My sister ordered a lobster once, and the whole thing came out. It wasn't peeled or anything. Don't wear white, and expect to get down and dirty on some delicious quality crawfish!!! My favorite. Will come. Back every time I'm in vegas"}
{"text":"after trying boiling crab in LA.. we decided to try hot n juicy since it seems some what similar.. parking is easy since there is a big parking lot..   order few lbs of shrimp, few lbs of Crawfish, sweet potato fries, fried catfish... for the shrimp and Crawfish we had half of it with the garlic butter sauce and the other half with hot n juicy special sauce..   to me the food is below average..  the flavors here is just OK.. only order i really enjoyed was just the fried cat fish..  i probably would not come back here if i were to return and visit Vegas.."}
{"text":"We ordered the get your feet wet. Crawl fish, shrimp, andouille sausage, potatoes and corn on the cob. All cooked together in baby spice. We enjoyed. The next table got the hottest spice. I saw tears coming from one girl. The bibs and gloves should of been my first clue."}
{"text":"After a terrible experience down the street at Bubba Gump Shrimp Company, we received a recommendation to come here. Brittney took care of us at the bar and she was amazing. Very attentive and great personality. The food was incredible. Best shrimp I've ever had outside of the gulf coast. My husband who normally will not eat seafood at all even enjoyed it. They even give you a bib and gloves so you don't get smelly! Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Hot and Juicy is definitely some hot stuff! I came here for the first time with Michelle W. last year and I really don't remember it being this packed for a weekend. However, the 20-30 minute wait was well worth the wait. We decided on the Hot and Juicy Snow Crabs in Medium, the Lemon Pepper Shrimp in Mild, Chicken Wings Basket with the Cajun Fries and a side of rice for me. I was definitely salivating waiting for the food to come out...which actually didn't take very long! Everything was SOOOOOO good! Next time though I think I will stick with the mild hotness level. My mouth was on fire by the time I was through...the cajun fries were probably not the best idea with all of this hotness going on, but I guess that's why they call it HOT and juicy. Everything that we ordered totaled up to about 45 bucks plus sodas....not a bad deal. BTW....the rice with some sauce is oh so delicious! I will definitely be back for more garlic dousing!"}
{"text":"during my vegas trip, i decided to stop by a crawfish restaurant! my friends and i were craving so we yelped out this place and decided to give it a try. being drunk the entire day gave us the biggest drink coma ever so we didnt get a cab til 1020 and didn't arrive here until 1040. service was great even when we came late and stayed super late.  we ordered hot n juicy crawfish and shrimp along with the catfish basket. the catfish was pretty good and the fries were good too! surprisingly we actually finished the fries and the catfish. we ordered the crawfish/shrimp in med. because the server was persistent about noting how SPICY medium really is. the sauce was good but a tad bit salty and not really the cajun texture i really like. as for spice level, medium isn't really that spicy. my friend and her bf can't eat spicy stuff but they were able to eat the medium with no hesitation. i liked the potato that was in the bag YUM. the crawfish were HUGE and the shells were soft so i didn't leave with bloody pricked fingers= ]. the shrimp; however, were a little small and the heads were kind of bitter. we weren't able to finish it cuz we were so full already!  i wonder why crawfish is priced differently in different areas? over here its 11$/lb. the catfish basket was 9 or 10$. it's about the same as in san jose. in LA it's 8$/lb and a catfish basket is about 8$. interesting! oh and they need to do something with the restroom because it's pretty dirty and a little gross.  btw hot n juicy is coming to SF:)"}
{"text":"The food is always consistently tasty and way overpriced. Problem is, it's the service at this specific location. It is just appalling here. Actually, it's like pulling teeth everytime we come here. They are quick to snap at you for asking a simple request and immediately give you attitude for pointing out something simple.   The last time we were there, the server just could not be bothered with being courteous and spraying herself with body spray. I do not appreciate being smothered by smoke before, during and after I eat in a non-smoking restaurant. It is disgusting."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! W stopped by on our drive back from Colorado and its only 5 minutes from the I-15, so it was a quick stop.   It did take a few minutes to be seated and get our order in, but they were understaffed and were all busting their butts to clean tables and get food out. Once we got our food in, it only took 10 minutes for it to hit our table.   I order the shrimp with Juicy Cajun Sauce and a corn and potato. The shrimp was huge and delious. My bf ordered the crayfish and they were really small and disappointing. He got the Hot and Juicy sauce, which was way better then my sauce. Overall, I would push the shrimp over the crayfish, but it was a fun eating experience and I can't wait to go there again the next time I am in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"The po boy had great flavor, but there were a total of 8 tiny shrimp on the entire sandwich. I had to move everything to one half to get the taste of shrimp. Server was friendly, but when we brought the fact that we were over charged to the manager she was less than friendly. She stated that the menus was wrong. I would get new menus before charging a dollar extra for everything and telling the customer they were wrong. So even if it says it comes with Cajun fries it is extra. FYI."}
{"text":"Fresh Seafood and Great prices. Staff was very helpful!! Oysters, 2lbs of mud bugs and 2lbs of shrimp!"}
{"text":"2-20-2012 Our 13th wedding Anniversary dinner. Great hospitality, quick seating. Ordered Crawfish 2 lbs was way to HOT for me (hubby ate), so the waiter ordered very mild for me 1 lb, didn't have to wait to long for my ordered. As I waited I chatted with people next to us, the young man ordered the VERY HOT Crawfish............. he said he couldn't man up to it, it was to HOT for him (but he ate it anyway while sweating). I must go back. I want the Crawfish again but wanna try something else on the menu. Certainly recommend when in Vegas and wanting Crawfish!!!"}
{"text":"Always love eating hot n juicy!! The servers were friendly during our last dinner here even when it was close to their closing time. They did forget our fries, but they brought it out for us as soon as we asked them for the fries. Definitely give a try to their crispy pork skin. It is a huge portion for 5 bucks and it is super delish!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The shrimp in the hot n juicy sauce is the way to go!! Cajun fries are great too!!"}
{"text":"Beer served within 5 minutes of seating. Hooray! Server was attentive and friendly. We ordered crawfish and soft shell crab basket. Basket served 31 minutes later. Not whole soft shell crab, just the crab legs. Womp womp . 10 mins later the crawfish came. They were 16/20's (16-20 crawfish per lb) We ordered Louisiana style and juicy Cajun flavoring. La style was just as expected.... Hot! Cajun was a degree less. Both good.  One potato and one half ear of corn with 2 pounds seemed a bit skimpy but all in all 4 beers 2 lbs of mudbugs and 1 side of crab 'fins' = $50 was not a bad value. Verdict: being from NOLA crawfish in the desert doesn't come easily.  Other than the wait the food was aok!  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"It was good and a fun experience, but I was disappointed that the baby spice for the shrimp was still spicy.  It was also too bad they didn't offer a smaller size dungeness crab and the juice could go through the plastic gloves they give.  This is great for a large group and yummy sides.  It's close to the strip and there are two nearby locations."}
{"text":"So..I was really excited and looking forward to trying this place that started it all, home of the Original and first Hot and Juicy establishment here in Vegas. I arrived a little before dinner time and the place wasn't packed. Ok. I got it, it's because no one has come for dinner yet. So, I'm happy about not having to wait but Not so happy about the service and their crawfish that day. The service was slow and unfriendly and the crawfish was not fresh at all. It was small and very chewy. I know crawfish is not in season in February when i went but I thought they serve up fresh live crawfish year round. I didn't expect it to be less great (being the first one opening) than their place in Washington D.C where it never disappoint. Every chance I visit D.C, I always stop by to order or eat in. The flavor of their sauces there seems tastier, more flavorful, and crawfish fresher. If anyone has a chance to visit D.C and loves crawfish as much as I do, then stop by the Hot n Juicy there!"}
{"text":"I give it four stars for the food.  Service is very poor, to say the least, but worth putting up with just to eat the food.   Again, I agree with my friend, Clint.   My wife has done crab legs and crab; I've done the Crawfish. We've both done the Shrimp.   My suggestion; stay with the shrimp. Order it to your spice level of comfort.   I like the Cajun Fries, my wife likes the Sweet Potato Fries.   Go early, or you will have a tough time finding parking and be greeted with a long wait.   It is pricey, but a great eating experience. We have taken my wife's relatives and friends from Korea to this place, and they always want to come back and make it their last meal before they return to home.   Not a great place for a first date, but great for someone you're very comfortable with, who isn't into trendiness and snobby atmospheres."}
{"text":"The food is always good, I've been there 3 times since March. I always get the Snow Crab Legs, Juicy Cajun Seasoning and Spicy for the spice level. The servers are always attentive and bring  my food out in a timely manner."}
{"text":"Extra Spicy Hot n Juicy is the way to go!!  Good stuff...took the sauce home and ate bread with it..ridiculously awesome!!!"}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. WORST food and WORST service I've ever experienced in my entire life. I ordered catfish and fries and my sweet potato fries were a soggy pile that was all stuck together and my catfish had no flavor. It was clearly heated up out if a box like from the frozen aisle of the grocery store. DISGUSTING. I will never ever go here again and neither should you. Oh and I forgot to mention that u had to wait to be sat and was completely ignored for 10 whole minutes!!!!!!! I hate these turds."}
{"text":"Seafood place that they charge per pounds. They have several flavors but I love hot & juice flavor and lemon pepper flavor. Finger licking they have a good size shrimp $ 11.99 / lb. I heard they have 3 locations , the 1st location is by spring mountain & decatur , the 2nd location by spring mountain & valley view, the 3rd by las vegas blvd & harmon. I never been to their 3rd location. It is hard to find the parking for the 1st & the 2nd location but the one by spring mountain & decatur is harder. Yummy delicious!! You should try it"}
{"text":"This place is delicious!! The only regret I have is I should have gotten the hot instead of medium. The service was excellent and a great location! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Pretty simple review. if you've had boiling crab, its similar.  Beware of the sodium content though. Just like any other crawfish place, it has lots of salt so drink plenty of water. (and be ready for sodium overdose)  Service was good, food was good, fair price."}
{"text":"I came here a while ago with a group of friends kinda predisposed. I had heard that you need to peel and break everything and that the food is brought in bags and you get stuff all over yourself. This is not my idea of a good time BUT the group I was with had already decided to eat here. We arrived and the place was packed!   With this in mind, I decided to go with a basketof chicken nuggets and sample food my husband and friends ordered. I was right, I am not a fan. People in the group ordered several seasonings, lemon pepper, cajun, etc. I found that once you peeled the shrimp, they didn't really taste to anything. i would have preferred the shrimp be peeled first then cooked with the seasonings. Everybody at the table enjoyed thei food so, I just figure it's just not my type of place."}
{"text":"Downright amazing.  I wish this was up in the Bay Area or that I lived in Las Vegas just so I could eat here ALL the time. It seriously makes me salivate every time I think about the delicious sauce that my shrimp and crab was saturated in.   I went with a fairly large group and we had a total of 12 lbs crawfish/shrimp/crabs. And it was completely devoured in 30-45 minutes. We had a mix of mild + medium spices and all of the food was soaking in the Hot n Juicy sauce.   MMMMMMM. I want to make another trip out here soon just for this place!"}
{"text":"Being from New Orleans I grew up on seafood so I was expecting to get bad seafood. Well it was way better than I expected. We was givin 2 crawfish a piece to test which I enjoyed. I ordered 1/2 pound of shrimp the sauce was hot n juicy which is a combination of all the spices together and the spice level was baby spice. I also ordered the shrimp basket and that was real good also.The waiter was very handsome and nice he explained the menu and kept the drinks coming. I will go again on my next visit to Vegas."}
{"text":"I came here because I was craving Sea Food. Best food choice that I have made on my trip to Vegas! The food was spicy and freshly cooked! I ordered \"The Drool\" and it was so good. They gave me a lot of Crawfish in this dish and only 2 Crab Legs which I did not like. This dish came with 2 pieces of corn and 2 potatoes, for the price I believe there could have been more of both and Crab Legs. The shrimp is not deveined which threw me off a bit but overall the food was seasoned to perfection, I would definitely stop in any time I am in town!"}
{"text":"We came here in a group of 6 and the food was good. I'm not a crazy into seafood so I usually order sides and stuff. My fiance is a huge seafood lover and noted that this was a great restaurant. We actually came here the night before but the place was closed already. This place is located in a strip mall in Chinatown. The price is average of all Cajun seafood businesses.  Seating area is very spacious and food came out quickly. If you're a seafoodie, do come and enjoy!"}
{"text":"I've had Hot N Juicy located in Chinatown, it was a great dining experience. This time around, we had a bigger party and we opted to have drinks in our hotel and get Hot N Juicy to go. Since this location was closest we called in for the order and picked up. It tasted good, they were pretty quick. So where is the problem? 8 out of 10 people got the bubble guts. Seems that shrimp was the culprit. Thank god our suite had 3 bathrooms. Maybe it was just a bad batch or to go is not the way to go, I just know that it got most of our party sick. Their stomach hurt for 2 days and 1 of those days we had to drive back down to San Diego. I know, sweet ride right? I like Hot N Juicy, Next time though, I will opt for dining in at their Chinatown location (:"}
{"text":"I, too, saw the segment on Man v. Food and was immediately intrigued.  A crawfish place in Nevada?  And it's supposed to be GOOD?  Hmmm..  Alright, you got me.  Let's go.  Touched down in Vegas at 5pm, checked into the hotel, and took a cab off the Strip to Hot and Juicy Crawfish.  It was a Monday night, and yet, the wait time for a table was 45 minutes!  Wow, really??  I was irritated, but at the same time, I was excited.  This must be really good if all these locals are lined up here waiting for crawfish!  After pacing back and forth and continually asking the waiters if our table was ready for about 45 minutes, we finally got seated.  Our table was buzzing with anticipation.  I ordered two pounds of the Garlic Butter ($10.99/ per lb.).  They have a lot of other seafood as well, but I came here for the crawfish!   And it was DELICIOUS!  They weren't as big as I've had them, but they were cooked perfectly and the seasoning was amazing.    After we finished eating, I was a bit startled when I got the bill.  $10.99 per pound of crawfish??  Supermarkets in Dallas sell crawfish for less than $2 a pound!  I guess you have to factor in the cost of shipping fresh crawfish from Louisiana all the way to Las Vegas, Nevada - which apparently they do EVERY day.    Is this the best crawfish I've ever had?  I'd say it's on par with the Boiling Crab, which is my favorite crawfish place in Dallas.  And it's only $4.99 a pound there!   However, if you're in Vegas, there's not a whole lot of alternatives.  If you love fresh crawfish, this is the place to go.   Pros: fresh crawfish, garlic butter seasoning is delicious  Cons: $10.99 a pound!  Always busy, expect a long wait time"}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Awesome food. Always comes out \"hot and juicy\". Philip is the best server at this joint by the way. He always takes care of us."}
{"text":"Waited 50 minutes after order is taken while all other tables came after us got food. Is it serious business or just incompetent."}
{"text":"Glad I finally got to try out this place. There was a bit of a wait to get a table around 8pm on a Thursday night. But there were many servers working and they were hustling.   Ordered the garlic butter shrimp with medium heat and a couple of potatoes. It is really fun to dive into it and essentially play with your food. Glad I asked for gloves as it really gets everywhere."}
{"text":"We've been coming here ever since they opened, you know, before they were uber popular because of Man vs. Food, before there was an hour wait to get seated,... We'd be the only ones in the restaurant and those days are long gone.    Plain and simple, the food is good. We had Crawfish and shrimp with garlic butter- less than mild, 2 sides of rice... OK, I love garlic but there's an abundance of it in the food. If you're not a fan of garlic, you are NOT going to like this  particular sauce.   The taste and smell of the food is pretty strong, thanks to the massive amounts of garlic, you can smell like seafood and garlic for a couple days after you eat here... No matter how many times you shower, no matter how many times I tried to get rid of the smell, it just would not go away. So if you've got some where to be and the smell of garlic and seafood will not be so appealing to the people around you, I suggest to come back another day because, it's no joke, the smell STICKS for days :)   (I'm doing laundry today, 2 days later and my purse and clothes still smell like garlic)"}
{"text":"This review isn't about the food or service. It is being written to inform others that there was a difference between what my intended tip was on the signed cc receipt and what was actually charged to my cc. Granted a $4 difference isn't all that much, but imagine if this was happening on multiple occasions. It's very dishonest and truly disappointing. They will no longer be getting my business."}
{"text":"Put on a bib and prepare to make a mess on your table covered in disposable plastic.  Hot N Juicy delivers delicious bags of crawfish, crab, shrimp, sausage, and other creole favorites.   I tried the garlic butter crawfish which was pretty good and lemon pepper shrimp which was also good.  Side corn was delicious and packed with flavor and the sausage was good soaked in the sauce.  The seafood in general is average..  My shrimp was a little overcooked - but still very tasty. It did not seem really fresh - perhaps it was frozen. The sauce is good and completes the meal.    The service was a little slow - make sure your drink is full as your food arrives or you may get stuck with hot-mouth!  I gave this place 4 stars because it is out in the desert. I love NOLA and I'm from Florida.. so I have high standards for seafood and cajun.  I am a true believer in fresh from the boat to your table. This is not really possible out here and these guys do an excellent job and have a really nifty theme. The place was packed and people seemed to be enjoying their meals on a saturday afternoon."}
{"text":"First time here man oh man soon as we got there we were asked if we wanted to sample crawfish I've never had it before so that was pretty cool they even talked us how to break it apart we ended up ordering garlic butter mild spicy shrimp half a pound and one pound of crab yum yum yum very delicious you get your food in a plastic bag full of yummy sauce have to peel pick get to the good stuff little messy they give you a bib and gloves but they were too big loose I went old school bare hands yum yum will return it is pretty big area inside plenty of seating tables have plastic on them for easy clean up all the staff were friendly very helpful"}
{"text":"Don't wear white, bring a hair tie and come with friends (so you can try multiple bags!) Hot N Juicy is an experience you have to try. No need to drive to Chinatown to get your Hot N Juicy (or similar restaurant) fix. The one on Eastern is just as good.  I'm going to assume you'll order the crawfish (because of the name of the restaurant), but I personally don't recommend it. The amount of meat in the crawfish is about a fourth of that in  the shrimp and the crawfish comes with more body parts (thus heavier non edible part, smaller amount of meat for the same weight and price? NAHHH). Also if it's your first experience the crawfish might freak you out.They look a little.... roach like.  1lb. of shrimp will be enough for one person, 1lb of crawfish won't be. Crawfish enthusiasts will tell you the meat is juicier and to suck out the juice from the head to get the full experience, but to me it tastes the same.   The Hot N Juicy sauce is buttery with a slight kick. They'll advise you that they come out spicier than you expect. We ordered the baby spice and that was perfect for us.  The Cajun fries were way spicier than the baby spice shrimp we ordered and we were unable to finish it. If you're getting a spicy meat, I suggest getting the good ol' regular salty fries to give your palate a break.  We also ordered the calamari (baskets come with fries, calamari is not considered a basket). Good, but it didn't seem worth the price- same price as the lb. of shrimp we ordered.   Quick service and no utensils. Just that alone sounds like a good restaurant to me."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of seafood but I find this place pretty cool, I like their shrimp by pounds! I always get my shrimp with a side of rice because I can't eat too much of shrimp. If you want something go either with medium or spicy, their medium is already hot (trust me, it is definitely spicy). It's an old restaurant, they could probably remodel it but overall it's clean. They usually have a long wait time on the weekends so plan accordingly. You usually get your food quick and they are friendly."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place.  Always come here when I'm in Vegas.  I never visit the LA location though...  I like this place better then boiling crab because it's WAY less oily and the flavor is more intense.   1 bad thing is that they are always out of blue crab and dungeness crab by late afternoon.    I always get at least 2 lbs of crawfish, HOT N'Juicy special (do not say whole shabang, the staff doesn't like that) Xtra Spicy... and I mean I like things spicy but they can never get it to where my nose is watering and my mouth is on fire... I guess thats better for my ulcer.  Staff works as a team and they are usually really good about refills and getting your order out to you quickly.    I always need to be near a bathroom 1-3 hrs after eating at Hot N Juicy though... if ya know what I mean..."}
{"text":"I love Hot N Juicy. I found out about this place from foodnetwork? or travel channel's mvf? not really sure.   The 1st time I've ever tried to eat crawfish was here. We ordered 1 lb of crawfish in medium hot&juicy sauce. After trying crawfish I learned that it's too much work for not enough meat, so never again. The hot&juicy sauce was delicious and pretty spicy. I love spicy food, but not so spicy that all you get is heat and no flavor.   I prefer to order the 1 lb of shrimp with 1 dozen sausage in mild hot&juicy sauce. With a side of cajun fries. This is a winner for sure. This entire meal would cost around $30 and good for 2 people. Hot&Juicy sauce in mild has a good balance of heat and flavor. I love to let my cajun fries swim in that sauce. The h&j sauce also has the best flavor out of the other flavor options they offer. Beware tho cause the garlic and butter in the sauce will make you smell all day. By the end of the day you can still sort of smell the sauce on your fingers.   I've also tried their raw oysters and you get 1 dozen for $15. It was good but the oysters are kind of small so I wouldn't really recommend it.  The calamari is ok. Cooked well. I tried dipping it into the hot&juicy sauce just because i love the sauce so much. Unfortunately it tasted too salty. The calamari is good on its own.   I'm from the Bay Area so I've tried Crawdaddy's and this is way better than Crawdaddy's. Crawdaddy's sauce is watered down compared to Hot N Juicy. Crawdaddy's shrimp also looks anemic compared to Hot N Juicy. I haven't tried Boiling Crab tho."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Seafood restaurant in town. it's always full to come eat here on the weekends but it is worth it!! you only end up waiting about 10 minutes anyhow. This has been the case everytime I come here on a weekend. The service is a bit slow but you forget about that once you start eating. The sauces are heaven if you love garlic and spice. The Cajun fries are the bomb!!! Definitely a must try if you are in the area."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love coming here.. However I have to say, every time we come here, it seems like the service is getting worst and unorganized. My boyfriend and I always get 2lb of shrimp and King crab legs. I have tasted all the flavors, but my favorite is the mild Hot N' Juicy sauce. I have noticed that shrimps comes out first before the sides or anything else and once the workers bring out all your food, they don't check back on you for refills or anything else.. Although the service sucks, the food is good."}
{"text":"Their Shrimp Cajun style is always good here. Great atmosphere if you have kids. It's messy so don't worry about the kids getting messy. Lol. Anywho Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Love this place for Cajun style seafood. This place is much better than boilong crab in shrimp size and flavor. I like getting extra spicy and soaking my shrimp in the sauce after peeling it.   Their clams are also really large in size but unfortunately most of them were no where to be found....I pulled out at least 7 empty shells at once trying to find one with some meat in them...I didn't know if I should tell the waitress or whether or not she would believe me. In the end I didn't but I know I should have !!   Their catfish is also really good but be careful it comes out hot ! They also forgot about our order so we had to wait to get it while everyone else already had their food. Cajun fries were also not impressive when compared to boiling crab.   Their best feature is definitely their sauce ! Would recommend just going for their shrimp and clams if you're lucky to get shells that aren't empty ( didn't get to try their crawfish)."}
{"text":"I like it!! best place in town for low carb diner. Inexpensive, very casual. Expect to wait for a table at diner time."}
{"text":"On Saturday night my mom and I decided to go here to have dinner. There was a 45 minute wait so we got ourselves on the waitlist. 20 minutes later we get a text saying they were ready for us. Once we got there we were taken to our table and had our drinks brought out to us. After our server took our order, she went back inside since we were seated outside. 40 minutes later, and still no sign of our server or our food. We see everyone who came after us get served their food, so we flagged down our server who said the kitchen said it would be a couple more minutes. So we then ask to speak to the manager and she goes to get the manager. An hour later since we ordered, the server comes back to our table and tells us that she put in our order five minutes after she took it but because of the long delay, she was told to pay for our meal because she will get in trouble if she doesn't. When she told us that she'd get in trouble if she didn't pay for our meal, she started to tear up, and We felt so uncomfortable and felt bad that again we asked for the manager. About ten minutes later the manager came to our table and we told her everything that has been going on and that we didn't think it was right to make the server pay for our meal for having us wait more than an hour for our food. The manager said she had no idea what was going on that she had to go back in to \"figure it out\". The manager then comes back out to our table and tells us to not worry about our meal. We then tell the manager that we don't want the server to pay for our meal because it makes us feel uncomfortable and that it isn't right to treat the servers in that manner. The manager then proceeds to tell us that we can then pay for our meal, which we tell her that we shouldn't have to for waiting now OVER an hour for both our meals. When the server came back to us, she tells us that it was fine that she would pay for it but we made it clear to the manager and the server that we didn't want the server to pay for our meal because it was not fair. All in all, my mother and I did not have a great experience at this location. Especially since the manager didn't act like a manager at all. It's insane how someone like her is in charge and how she treats her servers and customers."}
{"text":"We were gonna go to Hot N Juicy but we were 5 mins too early, and instead of letting us in to just sit down since it was too hot outside, they signaled \"5 minutes\" to us. We couldve been their first customer but instead they let us stay out in the heat. (Not to mention- hungry!) so we decided to eat someplace else. Too bad, I was really craving for it."}
{"text":"OMG hot n juicy... It's the BEST ive ever had and I feel bad for people who haven't tried it!!! Love love love their garlic butter seasoning, I always get 1 lb of shrimp and my husband's fave is hot n juicy seasoning for 1 lb of snow crab legs... If you want to enjoy the food you gotta just get \"mild\" as your spice level, otherwise it will be burning hot in your tongue and you wouldn't be able to enjoy it lol i always get their raspberry iced tea. This place could get VERY busy especially during Friday-Saturday nights"}
{"text":"I don't want to lower my rating here, but something must be addressed:  Prices.   This is an eatery with fluctuating prices based on market sales, so what a pound of shrimp costs today might not be what it costs tomorrow. And their entire menu lists \"Market Price\" where you'd normally find actual numbers.   So, where do they display this crucial information?  On the back of my waitress' order book.   They used to have a BIG SIGN advertising the day's prices. You know what's there now? A couple fucking TVs. How ingenious! Why let your customers know your prices when they could instead zone out on some fucking game and ignore the people they're dining with, all while annoying a waitress by making her hold up her \"price guide\" while I decide if I want king crab or clams.   Best part: there isn't even a fucking bar in front of the fucking TVs. Not that this place even needs one, but the lack of seating around these TVs proves their lack of worth even more so.   If you own this place/are a manager: lose the fucking boob tubes and try to look like a real eatery, not another jerk-off spot with 26 TVs. I go out to eat (novel concept, eh?), not space out on crap. Get with it, guys."}
{"text":"Oh, hell yes.   The first time I went, I didn't like it THAT much. The second time, I wised up and went straight for the snow crab legs ($14?). Its much more expensive than the crawdads, but yields way more meat. Hon n Juicy seasoning, mild.   I have so much fun eating here. Its so fun watching noobs struggle with the food.   Always a beer or two. Always some fries to soak up the juizez. Mm mm, bitch."}
{"text":"SOOOOOO DELICIOUS!!!!!! I love love love how affordable it is too! Ordered two pounds of crawfish, one order fried shrimp, cajun fries and fried catfish, all for four people, and it was definitely enough. I'm not sure if that's because I drank so much water that I became full. However, I love their sauce, you MUST go for their specialty! Really good asian blend of spices mixed with new orleans yummyness. I do have to admit that maybe about 10+ crawfishes in my tongue and mouth started to burn, but that wasn't going to make me stop eating!  Ok i have to admit that the crawfishes are a bit tiny, but the best part of it all is that you're suppose to suck it all. Not just eat the meat, but the brains/roes. For real! The corn was delicious after it absorbed all the flavor and it was so juicy!  Fried shrimp great, so was the catfish. I'm not sure what batter they use, but it's amazing. Nice and crusty and oh sooo full of flavor! I like how the shrimp was butterflied open, and the catfish was so juicy inside. Not overdone at all. Complaint was the cajun fries...not enough cajun seasoning.   I'm definitely having more cravings....I want some NOW! Will they deliver to CA? That would be GREAT!"}
{"text":"Ate here with my friend and had a great meal! The food came out fast and was great- our server was Max and he was really friendly and even showed us how to peel our crawfish. I normally don't eat  at places like this that often because I don't like to get my hands too dirty but Max told us we could get the sauce on the side which was nice!  Will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"The music and service was good. Food and drinks were ok. Word of advise....please dont wear anything white, it gets messy."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite hot n juicy crawfish when it comes to the other 2 on spring mountain. I have gone here plenty of times and I love the spaciousness of this location and the service is good. Can't go wrong with shrimp!"}
{"text":"Thanks to Jay Money for a great seafood tour of Awesomeness with all the bagged goodness. Cleaned the pours with Spicy Hot&Juicy sauce, made my day...yeah get to this place for sure. Super Nice People"}
{"text":"Pretty good seafood. I've had the crawfish and shrimp and they were both quite delicious. I like the fact the crawfish is fresh as that's pretty hard to find (if not impossible) at other Louisiana boil type restaurants.  The seasoning is different compared to other restaurants i've been to, which is a good thing. The only thing holding me back from giving this place 5 stars is due to the longer wait time for your food  I would definitely come back to this place"}
{"text":"Wow, when you walk in here you can tell this is a real food joint as you get a strong aroma of seafood and garlic!    My friend mentioned the better deal is the shrimp as you get more meat than the crawfish!  So we ordered a bag of shrimp with sausage each.  I also ordered some rice to soak up the juice!    We prepared for the meal by putting on the clothes-protecting bibs that they provide you!    2 bags came out and we digged in.  Man... the flavour of the sauce with garlic is just amazing!  Let me say however that there is a ton of garlic!  So much garlic that it stayed on my palate the whole night.  However it's totally worth it for the experience.    To wash it down we had a couple of Blue Moon's!    So damm tasty!  These places don't come around very often!"}
{"text":"Have to say this place is really good. I loved their happy hour. Buy 1 Beer Get 1 Free.  Had to rate a 3 for the shrimp and crab legs. Their hot n juicy season with a spicy level was a bit to sweet for my liking. But service was great!  Corn fritters were amazing!! Omg and the Cajun Calamari was to die for!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was a great introduction to Las Vegas.  The food and customer service was great. The Hot and Juicy seafood special (med heat, hot was to much for me) was enough for me and my wife; along with the calamari appetizer. DO NOT go to the one on the Las Vegas strip, you will pay double price due to being there...if you have a rental car, try and eat  as much as you can away from the mainstream strip and venture out where the locals roam..."}
{"text":"Great seafood spot that is very casual.  Crawfish is good.  If you enjoy spicy food, dont let them talk you out of getting the hottest they have.  Definitely wear the gloves!"}
{"text":"I prefer boiling crab. I think this place is a bit over hyped just because it was on TV. The food was just OK, not amazing. The service was great though, and we got there early on a weeknight so we didn't have to wait. My main issue was that they were out of crawfish when we visited. It was kind of the reason we went"}
{"text":"Such a fun place to check out. Try the shrimp and the mussels for sure! The seasoning is amazing and the smell over takes the entire restaurant. The cajun fries are totally worth the price and are spicy beyond belief! I can't wait to go back! The only reason why I couldn't give it a full 5 stars was that some of our mussels were not cooked all the way through and our bill was messed up."}
{"text":"Only been twice and each experience was wonderful. The staff are really friendly and attentive. The food is just amazing. Had the shrimp which i'll admist the heads being on them still is a little freaky but you get over it once you taste it. The crab legs are perfect. I shared the two items with my friend we got a pound of each and it was more than enough to go around."}
{"text":"Ate the king crab legs in baby spice garlic butter. It was so delicious. Obviously a lot of work and mess, but it is very filling. Only issue I had was that baby spice was supposed to be less than mild and I still found it super spicy. But again it was so good!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious and service was great. Our server, Shea, was awesome and very kind! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Hot and juicy is my favorite place compare to boiling crab. Came here on sunday and order 1 pound shrimp and cajun fries.. its little bit busy but the food came so fast!  Food 4 Stars.. Service 5 stars. Water never empty! Good service.  Will coming back to try crab for sure."}
{"text":"Awesome fun. Love the Dexter atmosphere. Wear the gloves and when they say it's spicy....it is!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying food is casual and a bit on the spicy side.  Plastic table sheet, all disposable sundries.  Food is good, flavorful, and fresh.   I had the calamari, etouffee, and shrimp po'boy.   Definitely coming here again."}
{"text":"yummy yummy yummy!!! hubby and i come here the girls are always nice...busy but nice. and they got mussels too...yummmmm!!!"}
{"text":"Do you like to have your fingers stinging and smelling like garlic for days? Then this place is for you!!  I went here after finding it on YELP and my gambling buddy and I had the fried calamari, two pounds of shrimp, one pound of king crab legs, corn, hot N juicy style MILD and used a WHOLE MESSSSS OF NAPKINS.  It was FABULOUS.  The only thing I would try differently next time is get it medium in spiciness."}
{"text":"Paid $40 for a Dungeness crab that provided maybe a quarter oz of actual, edible food. When I showed the waitress, she insisted on it being the fault of the way I disassembled the crab, which would've perhaps aided in yielding another 1/8 oz of crab meat if done correctly. Mind you, this was in addition to $100 worth of lobster, shrimp and appz, all of which were delicious.  I'm not a fatty, I just like to splurge when the situation arises. If the young lady serving us would've even offered to comp me a house salad for feeling just a tad dissatisfied, I would've tipped her $100 instead of the $30 I left instead, which even my date still considered generous. I wrote this on the receipt though I'm sure the girl was happy to receive a tip at all, regardless.  Cook it at home. You'll impress her more and save yourself the money and hassle of being underserved by a barage of young waitresses who could really care less about seeing you off happy.   LG"}

{"text":"Ever since I saw this place on Man v. Food (one of my favorite food-related t.v. shows), I was determined to try this place during my next Vegas trip.  Alas the time had come and I dragged my friends to this place before our long drive back home to SoCal.  There are four different sauces you can choose from: Juicy Cajun, Garlic Butter, Lemon Pepper, and Hot n Juicy Special. We got two pounds of shrimp, two pounds of crawfish and a pound of snow crab.  They were covered in Garlic Butter and the Hot n Juicy Special.  We also got cajun fries and sausage.  Everything was so full of flavor.  All the seafood came in plastic bags to seal in the steam and flavor.  The crawfish were a bit hard to eat, but it was still quite delicious.  However, the only bad thing is that you will not get the smell out of your fingers for a couple days..no matter how much you wash your hands...and use hand sanitizer, but that's the price you have to pay for some delicious cajun seafood. :) I would definitely go back during my next Vegas trip."}
{"text":"I was up puking all night. The service was outstanding, but the food was terrible. They took over 40 minutes to bring our food out, but offered us free Cajun fries while we waited which was really nice of them. They kept checking on us and were extremely courteous. If there was a section to rate the service, they would get 5 stars for sure! The food though...that only gets 1 star. I always drink water when we go out and their water tasted awful like if it was from the ocean or the toilet or some place awful. Even adding lemons didn't help. I feel bad giving this place a 1 star review because they were so kind, but I really hated the food (and water). As soon as we walked in, I told my husband that it stunk in there like dirty fish and I wanted to go somewhere else to get a cheeseburger. I only ate a small piece of corn, 1 shrimp and a boat of Cajun fries. I was super sick. That food didn't agree with me at all. I hated how the shrimp eyes and legs were still attached. I could hardly even watch the other people around me eat. It was really disturbing - I don't eat meat very often anyways and when I do it's only chicken or a small cheeseburger. The food honestly freaked me out and I didn't touch the shrimp after that 1 bite. My husband's fingers stunk like fish even though he wore the gloves - Great way to ruin a great night out. I won't be back...EVER. It's whatever floats your boat I guess."}
{"text":"Love eating here and have never been disappointed. I usually get the snow crab legs hot and juicy baby spice cuz my boyfriend can't handle the heat and shrimp in garlic butter. Love it!"}
{"text":"Ohhhhh, myyyyyy, Gawd. I love it here. The fried shrimp were right on point. I recommend the Bleu crab at market value"}
{"text":"Love the food. .. don't like the parking situation.. i would go more often if the parking wasn't too costy :/"}
{"text":"I came all the way from Phoenix to eat at hot and juicy and the severs(Leila and Kayla) where amazing. We had a great experience and the food was great."}
{"text":"Flavorful, juicy, and aromatic.  It never gets boring when you're eating a pound of seafood with friends.  Although it gets a little messy, I'd say it's a fun social outing to do with friends....now if you're alone, then that's a different story.  I discovered this place a few months after it opened up, and went back every 2 weeks to get it.  I was on the \"Hot N Juicy\" fever.  You do get a little stench of seafood delight for two days, but it's well worth it to me.    I usually order: - 1 lb of Butter Garlic shrimp with 1/2 a dozen sausages, and a potato --- no spice, cause somehow it's still spicy. And shrimp, cause it's more meat. - Cajun and sweet potato fries (cause I can never chose which one I like best)  Always ask for salt, pepper, and lime for the dipping sauce.  To me, it just makes everything taste better, and save some of the lime for your hands.  It tries to remove the smell, just a little bit."}
{"text":"Food was good, seafood was high quality but device was rather sloppy.  There was a lot of staff but they seemed to wander around without direction.  It took way too long to get drinks and the entrees came out about 10 minutes apart.  Not sure if we will return."}
{"text":"I finally got to see what all the commotion was about. And it's about the best damn shrimp in Las Vegas . We opted for the hot juicy medium flavor and it was amazing. Make sure you use the protective gear they give you, cuz it can be messy. Also gloves are helpful as well so your fingers don't smell like garlic for the next two days. All in all this is probably my new favorite spot on Spring Mountain or even maybe Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Terrible!!! Seafood wasn't good quality & drawn butter wasn't clarified! Got sick less than an hour of eating here!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love both locations (which are like two blocks away from each other. I always get at least one pound of the fresh crawfish and a little of this and a little of that depending on who I'm with.  My last trip I did find a piece of metal (scrubbing sponge thingy) in my fried calamari. They took it off the check for me no problem.  Put a bib on because it gets a little messy with all the juicy deliciousness in the bag. Beware, you will smell like the things you order (plus garlic) for more than a little bit, but it's so tasty that it's all good with me!!!"}
{"text":"Just like the food in the big easy. It is sweet to see it in vegas.  King crab in garlic butter ( both my favorite ) med heat is perfect HOT. I will be back"}
{"text":"Been eating at H&J probably over 6yrs. I've been to all 3 locations. Love the their shrimps, bluepoint oysters, and sweet potato fries. Service is always friendly and fast. My only complaint is....Why do the prices keep going up???  C'mon man, more competition around you would think keeping prices fair! Just a thought"}
{"text":"if you find yourself in Las Vegas, this place is a must go! We were seated right away...i got 1 lb of king crab legs and 1 lb of shrimp with lemon pepper seasoning and mild sauce...the mild sauce alone was hot, i cant imagine getting their hottest hot sauce...if you're not a big seafood person, like my girlfriend, they have chicken nuggets with fries...the chicken nuggets were very juicy, and the fries are indescribable definitely go back if i ever find myself in Vegas  for people in the bay area, hot n juicy crawfish pwns the boiling crab"}
{"text":"We had crawfish, crab legs and shrimp and all of them were delicious.  The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars was because the service was slow after we received our food initially.  Our mouths were burning and we needed fries and drink refills, but we had a hard time tracking down the waitress, and they weren't that busy!!  We'd still return because the food was out of this world."}
{"text":"Delicious!!!  We come here every time we visit Vegas!  It's a great experience. I highly recommend sharing a bag if there's two or three people together. The portions are enormous. The service was good as well."}
{"text":"4th time here & it's been nothing but good reviews. Shrimp was a bit off tonight... But maybe it was just tonight. Outside of that... Great staff great food great ambience!!!"}
{"text":"If I were to pick one word and one word only to describe this restaurants it would be: TASTY. The shrimp here is sooooooo good it's crazy! The only problem is that you get the shrimps full. Head and all and YOU have to deal peal them. That's the only pain. But the flavor is so good it'll make you come back for more."}
{"text":"Finally we don't have to drive off strip anymore for our mandatory meal at Hot N Juicy. Loved the crawfish and snow crab once again and it's low carb / keto!! We went with mild (which felt like medium) and medium (that felt like hot) with Hot N Juicy seasoning. We had 2lbs of crawfish and 1lb of crab which was reasonable. Didn't have to wait for a table. Service was a little slow towards the end to get the check and pay but otherwise no complaints. Thanks for opening a location by the strip. We'll be back!!"}
{"text":"I was lounging on the couch and was watching Man vs. Food. Okay, this pique my curiosity about crawfish. So, what happens when you're in vegas for a bachelor's party for a few days? We ended up at Hot N Juicy. We were seated soon. But as we sat there, the dinner rush hour started to near and the line has gotten long. There was even a waiting list. We ordered 2 lb of crawfish with extra corn and lobster.  The crawfish was good. But it was alot of work for such little meat. The lobster was a little more expensive but it was so worth it. There was so much meat, we didn't have to spend too much time getting to the succulent meat. The dinner rolls came to us warm. Too bad it took 2 bites and it was gone.  Even though it was good, but being spoiled by my regular spot in Portland, Oregon, I really can't say it's THAT good as My Brother's Crawfish."}
{"text":"It's pretty rare that I give out a 5 star review. We had a group of ten. We filled up 3 cabs. Two cabs dropped off our group at the first location. One cab dropped us off at their second location. We were bummed about the situation until the host offered to take us, at no extra charge, to the other location. So awesome. Thank you Nick.  We ordered the crawfish, chicken wings, soft shell crab, calamari, and shrimp...all spicy. Everything was spectacular. Super juicy crawfish, full of flavor. Potatoes and corn were perfectly cooked too.  The deep fried food were extra crunchy. I highly recommend the soft shell crab and chicken wings.  This is probably one of the best crawfish joint I've been too."}
{"text":"Crawfish in Vegas!! had cravings after all the partying, gambling and drinking i was doing. really good."}
{"text":"This place has all the quality to deserve 5- stars rating:  Service- very friendly and fast respond service. Called in for to-go, the server who took order remembered me over the phone and say hi to me. Ordered extra rice on the spot and was ready before I even paid for the check.  Food- 1IB of shrimp, clams, 6 pieces of sausage, 4 pieces of corn, mix sauce and mild spicy. Everything is fresh, juicy and none of that soggy shrimps I had in those Vietnamese crabs places."}
{"text":"Pretty good...for Vegas.  Here's my recap:  Parking could be better.  Not a lot of spaces.  Available spaces were a little tight.  Seated immediately upon entering.  The place was pretty busy.  Many tables with chairs, some with booths.  Some booth seating was not accessible because the neighboring table was too close.  Servers were friendly, fast, and knowledgeable.  Menu offered crawfish, shrimp, oysters, clam, lobster, blue crab, dungeness crab, King crab, and snow crab.  All market prices.  Seasoning choices were Louisiana style, juicy Cajun, garlic butter, lemon pepper, and Hot N Juicy special.  Choice of mild, medium, spicy, or extra spicy.  Sides: corn, potato, sweet potato fries, cajun fries, rice, rolls, and sausage.  Also, appetizers were etoufee and a large variety of fried items: calamari, hot wings, soft shell crab, catfish, shrimp, and chicken nuggets.  We ordered two pounds of boiled shrimp: one Louisiana style medium and the other juicy Cajun medium.  Bibs were served first.  The bottom of the bib folds over to make a pocket to catch debris you drop.  We also ordered a side of white rice.  The cook time seemed about right, not real fast, but not too slow either.  Constant line for men's restroom.  Only one person at a time.  Many people waiting to get in to wash their hands after eating.  The food comes out as it is ready, not served at the same time.  I prefer this method.  The shrimp is served in a clear plastic bag and the shells are left on the table.  Plastic table cloth makes for quick and easy clean up.  The shrimp was good sized, hot, and flavorful.  There was a little extra juice in the bottom of the bag which we used to dip our shrimp once peeled.  Also, we ladled some on the rice for a bit of flavor.  The shrimp was head and shell on.  This requires a little work, but is the traditional way to serve, saves the kitchen a bit of time, and leads one to believe the shrimp were alive when cooked.  I lived in Louisiana for many years so I know there is a difference between Louisiana style and Cajun style, but I don't know why they made the distinction here.  Most patrons in Vegas won't know the difference.  The difference here is that Louisiana had more butter and Cajun was more traditional with more spices and less brother allowing the sweet flavor of the shrimp to come through better.  The difference is almost not noticeable, but I prefer their Louisiana style.  The rice was okay.  All in all the food was pretty good.  We really enjoyed it.  On a side note, they did not purge the shrimp.  That is, the gastrointestinal track and the poop were still in the shrimp.  Vegas patrons don't know any better.  Its kind of gross, but I ate anyways knowing that it won't hurt you (otherwise, the place would have been shut down a long time ago).  There were plenty of paper napkins at each table and wet wipes served at the counter and with the bill, but I would have preferred a washing station, similar to those at Cravin Cajun.  You get really, really messy eating boiled shrimp and that stuff is super painful if you get it in your eyes.  They do serve alcohol, but we had tap water, which was served in styrofoam cups.  The server did not ask if we wanted lemon, but she brought out a styrofoam bowl with almost two whole lemons (kind of a waste).  Shrimp was $8.99 per pound and the side of rice was $2.  We really enjoyed this experience and will be coming back.  I tried the crawfish on a previous visit here.  It was the best crawfish in Vegas.  Flavor was right, but a bit small for Louisiana standards.  I love crawfish, but think the shrimp is a better deal because there is much more meat.  I really like this place, but Cravin Cajun is better."}
{"text":"Staff and restaurant... clean, friendly, helpful, don't wear good clothes and certainly not WHITE.  This is a get your hands dirty kinda place.  Can be LOTS of fun if you come with the right people."}
{"text":"Fun place to come and eat with friends cuz it's gonna take awhile to peel and eat your dinner.  Would do it again but take it from me, don't wear white or anything you like cuz you WILL get messy."}
{"text":"Never get enough of it! Always have shrimps hot N juicy or garlic butter. 5/5! Sweet potato fries is delicious as well. 5/5! My friends always add a corn. I ordered lobster once. 4/5! Lol I don't know how to eat it!! They said they can crack it for you. Crabs are good, my friends' favorite! 5/5! Sausages are optional,  I had them sometimes. 3/5! I have been both places. My friends like it on Decatur 4/5!,  but I kinda like it at Valley View because it is newer, even though there is wired smells and long queue! 3/5!"}

{"text":"I hate seafood but love this place. The shrimp in the hot sauce is amazing. The lobster is so delicate. This place really had the idea perfectly modeled."}
{"text":"Had a dozen oysters @ \"mkt price\" - took 30 mins, they were warm and ended up being $19/dozen and service sucked."}
{"text":"First time!! Found this place by mistake looking for a quick bite to eat and I was blown away! Jay the beautiful server was amazing!! She showed my husband and I how to break the crawfish. The food is beyond amazing and it comes out very fast!! We'll definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love a shrimp boil?!?  This place is Amazing!   We have been coming here for years and so glad they are expanding their locations - even in AZ now!     I used to not like peel and eat shrimp but now I can't resist. The flavor is hands down the best ever so come check it out!!"}
{"text":"I love this location the BEST!  The people at this particular location are AWESOME!  I always recommend my friends/family who are in town to go there.  The only downfall is their limited parking."}
{"text":"Went to eat to hot and juicy when we went to Las Vegas and we were tired of eating at the strip. This crawfish was amazing and the season fries went well with the crawfish. The name of the restaurant says it all the crawfish was yummy and juicy,  can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This location is not as great as it was when they first came to Glendale. My family and I went there last night and the wait was long (which is usually worth it), the portions seem way smaller than before and the shrimp in all of our bags were almost dry because there was such little juice (hot and juicy sauce). When our waitress came to ask if we were doing okay, we asked for a side of by and juicy sauce, more beer, and ranch... about ten minutes later she came back and said \"are you guys still doing okay\", we had to ask/wait AGAIN. We are still considering going back to this location."}
{"text":"Family restaurant with very friendly staff. I ordered the \"Get Your Feet Wet\" sampler with crawfish, shrimp, andouille sausage, potatoes and corn and had the hot n' juicy and lemon pepper sauces to enjoy it with. The server, Danny, was amazing. He allowed us to sample the crawfish etouffe which was delicious. We also ordered the corn fritters. Yum!! The fries brownies knocked my socks off. I was so tempted to get another order but I resisted. The food was great, the place was clean and the servers were awesome"}
{"text":"Service is great! All the staff is attentive and came by frequently to check on us.   Food has its ups and downs when compared to boiling crab. The shrimp is larger here and the sauce has more flavor (in my opinion.) The king crabs are also bigger and it was meatier here than BC. Oysters were fresh but they didn't have tobasco or any hot sauce, which was a bummer.. And the sweet potato fries were ON POINT! They're cooked perfectly!   The downside - don't bother ordering their any of their fried foods. We ordered calamari and the rings were TINY and overcooked, Cajun fries are regular French fries with Cajun seasoning sprinkled on top (nothing special), and the chicken wings were okay, didn't have much flavor to them.   All in all, I would come back here again for the delicious seafood and amazing service."}
{"text":"Crawfish, crawfish, crawfish.  Theirs nothing better then good fusion!!!  Just get their early cause it gets busy"}
{"text":"This girl named I think jaymee served us and did extravagant. If I could give it 6 stars, I would,  just because of her. HOLY BALLS, the food was amazing. GOOD JOB HIRING HER."}
{"text":"This place is definitely another Boiling Crab, but in VEGAS! Super dope!! i LOVE everything I try at Hot N Juicy. After a great weekend in Vegas this is how you should end your trip. A GREAT meal before the long ride home or easy flight. Either way this place doesn't dissapoint me at all. I will be here everytime I am in Vegas. Mark my word! Check out my photo of the Crawfish, Wings and Shrimp."}
{"text":"On Fri Jan 30th, my friends and I had a reservation for 25 people. It was my first time at any HnJ ever. It was recommended by a friend as many of were flying in from out of town.   My friend ordered a lobster at approximately 7:20pm. Everyone else, including those who arrived closer to 8pm ordered and received their food before my friend did. We inquired 3 times about his order, making sure his order was in fact taken. We were reassured that it was. In the interim, my friend was so hungry. He was able to get bits and pieces from what the rest of us ordered. At 8:35pm, over an hour after he ordered he got his lobster.   When I spoke to Jillian, the manager on duty that night about the situation, her reply was \"There's nothing we can do. It's Friday night and we're dealing with two big groups.\" Excuse me, but if you're establishment is so popular, yet you are not prepared to handle such business, then perhaps you don't deserve to be so busy. I mean there are plenty of places that would either employ enough staff to handle their clientele. At the very least Jillian could've offered a discount or something. Her nonchalant non-cooperative attitude was less than desirable.   I would also add that the lack of greens (collard, okra, spinach) would make me rethink visiting any HnJ anywhere.   The bright side of all this was Cassandra who was a positive and enthusiastic server, hence any stars whatsoever."}
{"text":"I came here and it was my first time trying Cajun food. I loved it! I ate here multiple times and always order the same thing which is shrimp, fries and rice. I always eat with my rice on the table lol. Although this location is small I would come here again...but thank goodness for the newer location just down the street!"}
{"text":"I love hot & juicy so I'm glad they opened this location. We came here after the grand opening for the first time since the older location is smaller and was always busy. My friend works here and ended up being or server the first night and the other workers were very nice too. As always, I ordered a pound of shrimp, rice and fries for myself. It's pretty cheap to eat here considering how good the food is. It's worth getting messy and eating with your hands lol. I will come here again in the future when I'm in town again."}
{"text":"The best fresh seafood freshly cooked, be prepared do dive in those loaded bags of cooked seafood, no worries you will be provided with gloves, this place is packed most of the time can't blame them the food is so good, prices are very reasonable for the quality of food you are getting but don't expect a cheap bill it's real seafood after all, enjoy the best seafood in Las Vegas and maybe Usa"}
{"text":"This is our favorite Hot n Juicy location, not only because of the speed the food is served, but also because of the awesome customer service we get every single time, especially from Max, since he is our server 90% of the time we come, amazing guy!"}
{"text":"After years of living here, I tried going in. When I left, I found out something very disturbing as to why I haven't before. It has nothing to do with the establishment or reputation, so don't let that dissuade you.  Out front, you see that it's in a strip mall and it's not a huge place. You go inside and it has the feel of a sports bar, but with a lot of families and bustle going on all around. Right away you see piles of napkins, bibs and seafood debris. No, it's not Aria, but that's what I like. People were comfortable eating with their hands, doing what needed to be done to get to their dinner locked in various shells and exoskeletons.  Service was the first and lasting thing I noticed. Someone sat me, and while I was deciding, 2 others came up to ask me if I was ready, what I may need, what to drink, etc. It was a tag team effort I appreciated. I have worked a lot of restaurants, and I know you have maybe 4-5 tables to take care of and honestly, 99% of servers don't give a shit about tables not in their section, \"they're not tipping ME,\" or if the the customer has a problem with them, it blows YOUR tip. But here, servers help every table they walk by.   There were people waiting to be seated and 2 large groups were less than half occupying their tables pushed together. The only problems I had in this is seeing the solution. Some restaurants have a policy of not seating large groups until they all arrive which is how the first should have been handled. With the campers at the other party, I have and seen other servers take a table as people from the large group leave to set it up for a new 2/4 top.   The tables are funny, the table cloth is plain white plastic and the napkins are rolls of paper towels. I find it comforting because they don't mess around, there is high volume picking and peeling going on here.  The menu is a simple piece of paper with most options listed on it and the spiciness of how you want it prepared. Aside from crawfish, there's shrimp, crab, much more. Damn, I can't find my copy of the menu they let me have... They also sell sides, so I got rice expecting some broth with my order. I ordered a medium spicy combo. I can talk about different types of spicy all day, scoville units, the whole thing. But this had a nice lingering spiciness to it. Drinking soda (acids) doesn't help extinguish spicy food, but I was being good because I had to drive. No, beer wouldn't have helped, either. It may help some people to bring antacid if they want to show off.  Ask them what the market rate prices are listed on the menu so you can compare, or don't get surprised.  Dinner was served, a server unceremoniously plopped a pound bag of crawfish on my table. Hahahaha. Rice came a few minutes later and I was already in my plastic bag. Crawfish is big in my family and I'm from the bay area. There is a LOT of work busting open the shells, sucking the heads and getting what little meat there is out. They had bibs and I opted to not get one, I thought I was a big shot. I didn't have a nutcracker either. You can tell some of the pros in the restaurant, they brought their own. But the shell was soft enough to bend and snap the claws (tip, snap towards the front of the bag, or rice bowl). The head can be scary to eat, there's cartilage and bits and things that I was used to having in a soup, hence the rice. It was a bed I let everything drip onto. People complain about how small they are, but you WANT that, the smaller ones growing have more flavor, just like peppers. You don't want a large or genetically engineered huge crawfish.  This is where it gets personal. To be honest with you, I haven't had crawdads in years since I worked at the Orleans buffet. But that was once and part of a larger meal. Before that, it was decades. I had a rush of all kinds of family situations and get togethers and people attacking crawdads. It's not like shrimp, there's a lot more savage carnivorous behavior in eating crawfish. I felt like I took the easy route with all the shrimp cocktail and larger crustaceans I've had in town.  And there were a lot more memories than I was prepared for.  I made the mistake of reading some of the others reviews. Their complaints seem to be about places outside of the valley which I disregard. Everyone knows the south has better crawfish, \"...everything is trucked into Vegas.\" But IN the valley, there's nothing like it.  I had about a quarter pound left to go for later, paid my tab. They have tee shirts there, which is nice. There's no greater advertisement I think than the local's place tee shirt. \"Everything okay?\" \"Everything was fine, just a little spicy, baby doll\" I lied. My eyes were red and teary from 25 years plus dormant memories."}
{"text":"Just picked up our order of 2lbs snow crab legs and 1lb shrimp Louisiana style \"mild\" and 1lb shrimp garlic butter \"mild\" to go. The waitress that helped me out was very helpful and nice.   Got home all excited but we CANNOT eat any of it! None of it. Everything was too spicy. My wife loves spicy seafood, took one (1) bite and her face turned red right away. Again, we ordered \"mild\" so we just couldn't believe how spicy everything was. I understand the name of the restaurant is Hot n Juicy but this is just insane.   Called them up to see what can be done since we had just paid close to $85. They said that they \"cannot control the batch of peppers they get\" and it can get really spicy. I was also advised to cook our food up again in butter. So our parents are currently recooking the meal that we paid for. Feeling very frustrated.   I'm not sure if it would've been different if we ate in the restaurant and if this is the norm for their \"mild\" spiciness. If it is, I'm not sure why they even have that as an option and please be warned that it is VERY HOT!"}
{"text":"Fantastic idea.  Crawfish, shrimp, crab, etc with a variety of sauces, served in a .....plastic bag?  Because they put the sauce and the seafood in a plastic bag and cook the whole thing, the seafood stays moist and the flavors of the seafood and the sauce all blend toegther.  And don't let that extra sauce go to waste, eat it with rice or bread, it's wonderful."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I was hesitant to try Hot N Juicy.  Now that my cherry was popped I can't stop thinking about it.  I've been back every week since the first time I went, and one week I went twice.  I'm not a crawfish fan.  Maybe that is why I was so hesitant.  Nonetheless, I wanted to be open minded and faced my fears.    There was a half an hour wait and I remember thinking- this better be worth my time!  The staff is pretty friendly and accomodating so it helped my nerves while awaiting for our table.  I didn't order the crawfish but I did order the Hot N Juicy medium shrimp special as well as some corn and cajun fries.  The sauce on the shrimp was spicy, buttery and garlicky goodness.  3 things I love the most.  The shrimp is placed in a big plastic bag so the shrimp soak in all the juices from the sauce, and they put the corn (on the cob) in the bag to sit in the sauce also.  OMG.  SOOO good!  Eventually tried to expand my horizons and get the crawfish, but I wasn't a fan.  That is only because they creep me out.  So I'm a bit bias.  BUT shrimp fans rejoice."}
{"text":"The shrimp was very large, juicy, and fresh!  We also go the crawfish, both hot  n juicy style spicy.  I liked the tasty sauce, it was nice and thick so the seafood was well coated.  The sausages were better than any of the other seafood boil places I have been to.  I just wish the hot n juicy style was more lemony but that's an easy fix- just squeeze more fresh lemon to your taste.  Great service for the soft opening.  Can't wait to come again!"}
{"text":"Love the food & service we are here for lunch, less busy today and only 2 servers available, but they're soooo amazing & friendly on taking care of all customers.. Food served pretty quick & great place to have seafood overall"}
{"text":"This place is simply awesome. Their special Hot n Juicy sauce is better than crack and pairs wonderfully with Shrimp, Crawfish, Clams...damn, the entire menu...It's pretty spicy but feels so good in your mouth...And best of all, its very affordable..For two people, we had  2.5lbs of crawfish, shrimp and clams chased down with 4 beers and the bill was only $47! I love this place! Better than anything you can get in New Orleans!"}
{"text":"It's no boiling crab but it's delicious and available in las Vegas."}
{"text":"We ordered shrimp and crawfish in the hot n juicy, lemon pepper, and ragin cajun, all at the medium spice level. MMM MMM MMMMMMM!!!!!!  My favorite was the lemon pepper and the hot n juicy was a very close second. I would pass on the ragin cajun next time. We also ordered corn, which soaked up all the delicious flavor. I always have to have corn at these crawfish joints.   I know the place is called hot n juicy CRAWFISH and a lot of people love crawfish...but it is a lot of work for a very small pay-off. Because of that, I think shrimp is the best way to go!! I love peeling the shell off and then dipping the shrimp meat back into the juice.   For the Bay Area people, this place is a lot better than that other crawfish place in Oakland and maybe at the same level (or better) as the uber-popular one in San Jose. I might even rank it higher than the place in San Jose because the sauce doesn't seem as buttery and artery-clogging.   Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"If your not afraid to get a little messy then hot n juicy is a must! They have a variety of seafood such as shrimp, lobster, snow crab, blue crab and of course crawfish. You pick your protein, then they have a variety of sauces. I personally like them lemon pepper the most!   Don't know how to eat crawfish? Don't worry they will demonstrate for you!    This is a fun date night or great for a group to share! They do get very busy very quickly though so a lot of times there is a little wait but it is well worth it!"}
{"text":"on our most recent trip to vegas, which was just this week, we ventured off the strip and tried Hot N Juicy Crawfish.  it was phenomenal!  we had never been here before so we were pretty unsure of what to order...the waitress was super helpful in explaining the menu to us.    we ordered two pounds of crawfish and crab legs (mild, hot n juicy) with potatoes and corn and a few blue moons. the food was so incredible. so messy. so, so good.  the spice level was right on with what the waitress said it would be and wasn't too overwhelming.  she said even the medium is a little spicy so we went with the mild.  my lips were tingly...and i liked it!  the crawfish are a lot of work with not much payoff but it's fun...if you go expecting to get lobster-sized pieces of meat out of a crawfish, well, duh.  it's a crawfish.  the potatoes were great...new potatoes that soak up all the juicy sauce.  same with the corn.    i can't say enough about this place except that i wish we had found it sooner.    oh...DON'T go in your fancy club clothes.  you'll leave smelling like garlic and seafood.   do go expecting to have a good time and an enjoyable meal. your palate will thank you!"}
{"text":"Great food, but couple of pointers.  1. You will stink, for a while. I can still smell garlic (probably coming out of my pores) a day later. So you probably don't want to take a date here.  2. King crab legs are good, but the shell is actually very soft, so that makes it very hard to break the shell to get to the meat.  3. If you order 2 pounds of crawfish, expect to get less... because we had quite a few tiny crawfish in our bag."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever .DC hot and juicy is the best . This place needs better management and customer service ."}
{"text":"I would hands down return again and again!   I loved the shrimp, the King crab, the crawfish and the sweet potato fries! The seasoning is A+!!!!  I'm just so upset we don't have this in Australia!"}
{"text":"Too bad they ran out of fresh crawfish but it didn't really matter. Frozen was still freaking amazing. We ordered other things and it was pretty awesome! The place was packed had to wait 30 minutes but it was definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"For the prices charged serving crawfish in a clear plastic bag is uncalled for. Seriously, how expensive is a plastic bowl. Food was good, presentation lacking."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. The staff is rude, they had plumbing issues and when the plumber showed up and we had already been waiting. That it would be another hour. The entire visit was handled horribly. This was our first time to hot and juicy and I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I dont know why I haven't been to this location before.  Same quality food but not a long wait like their other locations."}
{"text":"If you have ever had crawfish before this is not the place.  The crawfish are previously frozen and reheated in a plastic bag that is plopped down on the table in front of you. That's it.  No plate or tray. It is nothing like the Ad here on yelp placed by them.   The atmosphere is okay and it was still a fun to see the rookies give them a try. Generally I say take a pass on the frozen Crawfish from China unless you are out to try something new. Please open the attached photo of the presentation. All the boiled seafood comes this way."}
{"text":"Here's a plastic bag of small frozen mud bugs.  I ordered a pound of crawfish, cajin fries, and étouffée.  My order came out one item at a time with very poor service. The crawfish were literally in a plastic bag that was dropped on my table, no plate, no potatoes, no corn, no presentation.  The crawfish were clearly not fresh (which I could understand in AZ) and were smaller than I have enjoyed in East Texas.  As I was finishing up my crawfish my fries were delivered and later my étouffée.  The food was about a three star, but the poor service and horrible presentation cost it another star.    Comparing this meal to a Louisiana Crawfish Boil is a bit unfair, but the Juicy Crawfish didn't even make an honest effort."}
{"text":"OMG BEST CRAWFISH OF MY LIFE!  THEY REALLY ARE HELLA HOT AND JUICY!!  *mouth waters*  Seriously though, this place is  BOMB!  A must try for anybody that enjoys seafood and is hanging out in Vegas.  The restaurant is located near LV Chinatown, off the strip on Spring Mountain Road.  It gets really busy in the evening, so I would recommend making reservations before hand.  My group of eight had to wait 45 minutes for a table (but since we were all pretty buzzed it went by extremely fast, lol).  The décor inside is very nice; definitely makes you hungry and impatient for the seafood.  The smell of hot, juicy crawfish is mixed in the air... I could not wait much longer to sink my mouth into them!  We ordered three pounds of crawfish (each pound including a potato), calamari, and Cajun fries.  The crawfish wasn't too expensive (under $15 a pound), and when they arrived in bags, we were ready to chow down.  I took my first bite of spicy crawfish, and BAM!!  Juices flowed into my mouth, and I was in crawfish heaven!  Everything was delicious!!  The crawfish pieces were decent (I mean, they don't have a lot of meat on them anyway), but once you start crunching on its shell, the juices come right out and that itself is so tasty.  I definitely plan on coming back here in the future.  Valet parking is not available and is limited, but there is a grocery center across the street where you can park and walk over."}
{"text":"This location is much nicer and cleaner than the other places on Spring Mountain in China Town."}
{"text":"now that I've been here a couple times I'm pretty content. it's a lot bigger than the other locations. service is on point. (our server I thought he was kinda cute) food of course was hot n juicy! I'm definitely  a returning customer! :)"}
{"text":"3.5 stars  its not boiling crab but when your in vegas this'll get your fix  Pros - crawfish here is awesome, seasoning is great and the service is wonderful.      got a couple of pounds of shrimp and of everything there this was my fav.    if you like it hot n spicy this is the place to go... my nose and eyes were running like        mo'fo  Cons - boiling crab is much better imho    the cajun fries werent that good as opposed to b.crabs    i like hot food but maybe during my first visit it was a lil too hot for me   will prolly end up back here again... worth a try"}
{"text":"This is a place that will surely surprise you. From the road the restaurant looks unassuming. However when you enter the establishment it looks great inside and opens up nicely. You just wouldn't expect such a great atmosphere from the restaurant's curb appeal.   Furthermore, the other thing that surprised me was that we got plastic bags full of piping hot seafood equipped with plastic gloves and a bib. The experience is raw and very satisfying.   We did the shrimp and catfish. The shrimp was great and they came to us fully intact  (heads and all). As a Cajun I know all about peeling off the heads and eating the delicious meat. Loved the experience.  The catfish was not good. It came deep fried like it had used grease saved from years past. The insides (meat) was greasy too. Just don't get it.  Go here if you want great seafood in a raw manner."}
{"text":"This place Rocks!! Food Service Seating is all satifying.  The food and flavors are Excellent!  This is my go to for Cajun Sea Food.  I have not yet to hv a bad meal. I always get white rice and hot n juicy way of calamari.  The shrimp is my fav. I order it fairly hot and it is perfect - the shrimp is cooked in a baking pouch so when your food comes it is hot n steamy the entire time. The meat is cooked perfectly, juicy and flavorful of shrimp, muscle, crab, whatever seafood you ordered. I always get excited to dine here."}
{"text":"This place comes close to Boiling Crab; the house special seasoning is lighter and not as thick.  I always get shrimp but I noticed that the crawfish is huge here!   I love how the garlic in the sauce is minced up! Mmmmmmm"}
{"text":"Place was amazing. Sat us down right away, got our drinks quick, and very friendly staff. The food is also amazing. I got to try the crawfish, King crab, sausages and corn. They were all on point. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"1 lb of shrimp to peel with your bare hands before going out in Vegas? Totally worth it. The flavoring was great, not too spicy (requested because I'm a wimp.) Really want to try the crawfish!  Sides were yummy too. Crowded but didn't wait too long for a table of 6."}
{"text":"Awful.  Fist time here. Met several friends for a Friday evening. Menu sounded delicious so we all decided and placed our orders. Seemed like quite a wait for food although it was a Friday night so we were understanding. Once the order came out the server accidentally spilled red sauce on our friend (in a white shirt of course). She was apologetic just didn't add to our experience.  One person didnt receive their food. We asked several time and ended up cancelling it as we were all finished eating. The manager came over - ehh- not overly concerned with the experience in my opinion. Offered it for free yet based on the rest of our food he decided to pass. Food was blah. I suppose seafood in AZ in Sept maybe? Just not what we expected at all. No more visits for us."}
{"text":"Not my favorite place..  not worth it for somewhere that's always packed with people and for how much you usually have to wait. I was not happy with the hostess when I came in to eat for the first time because we waited for so long and they sat a big party of 6 and a 5 top before me and my friend.. I understand that they had to give away big tables first but we have been waiting for so long.. the crawfish seems to always run out so they only have frozen ones.. and for how much we paid, it was just not worth it."}
{"text":"Seems like every time I come here the services is get worse.. And it wasn't even busy this time.. I love this place,, but this time even the food was affected.. I'm daughter and I got a pound of shrimp and it wasn't even cooked all the way.... I don't know what's happening to this place.. It used to be the best in Vegas.."}
{"text":"Beware!!! Black mussels, clams are not fresh and too salty!!! Chicken nuggets from Costco, crawfish are babies (meat size only 1/3 of my little baby finger), + bad service (feel like we are invisible). Glad that we didn't finish the un-fresh seafoods!!! We got food poison within 6 hours!!!"}
{"text":"First time here! First time having crawfish! Seasoning is amazing!!!!!!!!!! I would say though I'd get lobster next time only because I was still hungry with the crawfish! Our server Alexis/Alexia was wonderful and very helpful!"}
{"text":"The shrimp in the Hot N Juicy sauce was so good!!! The shield was super easy to peel off. The crawfish were alright however the calm just soaked up so much of the sauce that made it very salty!"}
{"text":"The Good ....taste great. The bad they serve you your food like an animal in a bag and styrofoam I ordered rice and had to eat plain white rice.Like, I thought butter would come with plain white rice.O.K guess not   Place is very pricy, Not to have real forks and spoons.The sausage you order by the dozen Huh? Ughhh o.k.   This place penny pinches everwere.... I'm just use to this when it comes to seafood   Customer service great"}
{"text":"We actually wanted to go try Boiling Crab but there was an hour & 45 min wait so I called Hot & Juicy and they said it would be 40-45 mins so we rushed over there instead.   Upon arriving, we were told there would be a 20-25 min wait which was even better so we just walked down the strip to a clothing store to shop & wait.   Once we were seated, we were shown the menu with the market prices (which I forgot to take a picture of) but we decided we only wanted shrimp that night so we got 2 pounds of medium Hot n Juicy, 1 pound of mild Hot n Juicy, 2 bowls of rice, & 2 orders of Cajun fries.   The shrimp was amazing, perfectly cooked with awesome flavor (I ended up pouring some on my rice lol), the spice was perfect but we'll probably go a level higher next time. The fries were also great, everyone loved them.   The service was also great, I believe we had Loren (sorry if I'm mistaken) but she was so sweet & she checked on us very often which I really appreciated.   The only thing I would change is the fact that the waiting space is so tiny/awkward so everyone is clumped up by the door, blocking it so people can't get in/out. We actually waited outside because I thought it would be weird to just stand in front of the people who were sitting on the bench.   Overall: great food, great service, good prices, definitely would recommend to family & friends. My cousin who has been to both Hot N Juicy & Boiling Crab said HNJ is definitely better."}
{"text":"Went to this place and it is the bomb. I had shrimp and it was delicious . I would definitely recommend this place for everyone."}
{"text":"Our first time there.  Oh My!!!!  NOT our last.  It was super.  We had so much fun!   The waitress, don't know her name, explained the menu in details and then offered us samples.  So nice!   Then a young man took over our table and he was great!  He explained how to eat the crawfish and took plenty of time to make sure that we were enjoying our meal!   Great place to go w a group of people or just a couple.  But be prepared to get messy.  Well worth it!"}
{"text":"Well, we waited outside for about 20 minutes because it was so crowded. That's okay, the weather was nice. After we were seated And ordered, it was kind of a long wait but they were busy So I expected it. They brought out my husband's food first,and I had to wait for mine. When mine finally came out the sauce was delicious. I ordered the hot and juicy shrimp. The only thing I didn't like was having to peel the shrimp. But overall had a good time   I would go back on a less busy night."}
{"text":"Me and 3 friends came on Valentine's Day so it was B U S Y.  We checked in and were told it was going to be an hour wait. We still waited because I love Hot n Juicy. Because they're so great, and we didn't even wait an hour! We were seated in about 25 minutes. Despite the restaurant being so busy, we were served quickly. Mason made sure we had all of our orders correct and served us quickly and efficiently."}
{"text":"Hot n' Juicy is an old favorite of mine located on Spring Mountain between Decatur and Jones. Hot n' Juicy is definitely the messiest eatery in town, and all the more fun because of it. Sometimes when I give that description people don't want to try it, but it would be a shame not to. Besides the fun of eating here, the food is great. How can you really go wrong with fresh seafood, butter, and Cajun seasonings?  Today I ordered one pound of the crawfish ($9.99) and my husband ordered one pound of the snow crab ($13.99). We both asked for the Hot n' Juicy special seasoning, extra spicy! You are free to choose your heat level as well as the style of seasoning you prefer - Louisiana Style, Juice Cajun, Garlic Butter, or Lemon Pepper. Besides crawfish and snow crab, you can also order dungeness crab, blue crab, king crab, or shrimp.  The first time I had a crawfish boil was at my brother's graduation from University of the South in Sewanee, Tennessee. I remember them dumping huge buckets of steamed crawfish onto the tables and everyone would just have at them, discarding the shells and heads onto neighboring tables. At Hot n' Juicy it's a little different, but not much. You are given bibs and your table is covered in white plastic that is accessorized with your own roll of paper towels. They bring your crawfish in plastic bags that are tied at the top to capture the heat. When you open the bag you get an aromatic burst of spicy steam that gets you really excited for what you are about to enjoy. This is where the fun starts. Crawfish are peel and eat little buggers that require somewhat of an experienced eater to navigate through them in order to get to the savory bits. First you must detach the tail, which you peel just as you would the tail of a shrimp. Then, and this is most flavorful part, you must suck the head by gently squeezing it into your mouth so you can get all the juices and inner goodness out of it. If this sounds totally disgusting to you, go for the crab. They supply you with crab crackers, but Ian and I agree they should probably pre-crack them for you to make the experience easier and allow all the seasoned butter to seep into the meat. Whatever you decide to get, I'm sure you'll enjoy it.  If you order two pounds of crawfish you get a hunk of corn on the cob and a red potato in your bag, but since we ordered one pound each of different items we opted for the Cajun fries ($2.99). These came out hot n' spicy with a side of cooling ketchup. We managed to reserve some of the fries to dip in the juices at the bottom of our bags, and this was way better than the ordinary condiment. Who would have thought that you could make French fries even tastier and more unhealthy with the addition of seasoned butter? I guess Europeans serve their fries with mayonnaise, so I don't feel too guilty or out of line.  By the time you are finished, it looks like Hurricane Katrina has hit your table leaving a mass of wet and crumpled paper towels in her wake. This is certainly not a prime location for a wedding reception, but if you don't mind getting your hands dirty in the name of taste, you really should try Hot n' Juicy almost any other time."}
{"text":"I came here with the gf as she had been here before in California and said she liked it. I was pretty shocked as everything had eyes still lol.  After the shock wore off and I established a technique for acquiring meat from the carcass it wasn't too bad. We got crawfish and shrimp and I definitely preferred the shrimp as they had more meat. The crawfish were sort of a waste of time to eat because there was so little that was able to be eaten.  I wouldn't recommend coming here if you value not smelling like a sea creature, aren't a fan of wearing bibs and gloves while you eat, or if you just don't like the idea of cracking open a crustacean for it's meat."}
{"text":"So I've been going to the  first Hotn'Juicy and wanted to try their 2nd location. Their food was on point, just as good as the original spot. But I was disappointed by the service. Server was complaining that we were ordering too much. The place was not busy so I didn't know why she was in a hurry. Second, she accidentally knocks over my beer all over me and the table, which is ok cause it was an accident. I'm a server myself so I understand accidents happens. But she just stood there watching me to wipe down the spilled beer all over me and the table. On top of that she was laughing about the situation. Ok I understand maybe it's your first day, maybe tired but at least pretend your apologetic, and help a brotha out cleaning up. Thirdly, she never came back to the table to either bring more napkins, or perhaps offer a new beer! No one came down to our table except to deliver our food. We had to wave another person for another beer. No one checked back with us or anything. Our check was $130 for 3 people. We left $20 for the service that we didn't get. Let's just say not for awhile, but I will just wait in line to the original location."}
{"text":"Great place for Crawfish as the name implies. Came here a little while ago with some out of town friends and had a 30 minute wait for a group of 6 which seems to be the norm now since its been on TV foodie shows. Compared to the first time I came here there was no wait. Once we were seated we were quickly served by the cute waitresses whom a friend repeatedly flirted with but was shot down ;P  We ordered several 2lbs bags of crawfish in different flavors and several appetizers like the catfish, fried shrimp, and soft shell crabs. Everything was spiced nicely which they inform(warn) you that it is hotter than you might expect. The crawfish is live when they are cooked we were told, and that frozen were available because some peeps don't like it for some reason but I do notice the meat is a lot more tender. Don't wear your whites and prepare to dig in!"}
{"text":"I have family friends who have lived and grown on cajun food all their life and we all love this restaurant. The closest thing to great new orleans food in vegas."}
{"text":"Review is for the service:  My family and I came today for dinner and as we went in we were not greeted. A server who's name is Matt seen us walk in and did not even help us to get seated. He was starring for the longest time and mind you, we were hungry. Like HELLO, you have customers! And it's not like it was a busy hour, there was numerous amount of empty seats. A young lady ask if we were being helped after standing for a good few minutes and I said no. Matt, slowly set up our table and asked us how many and I said 7. We get seated and my cousin asked for waters all around. He did not ask \"can we start you off with anything to drink?\" He literally stood frozen like hello say something. And he had to count how many waters when I said in the beginning there was 7 of us. Him and the other team members were working slow except for this one guy who was not wearing a name tag. He seem Pacific Islander. He was a fast worker and helped a lot of customers and I would give him 5 stars but too bad he wasn't our server. He did ask and made sure that we were ok after we were done paying the bill."}
{"text":"Dude, everyone loves Hot and Juicy but when you have AMAZING service to boot you just wanna keep coming back for more. Heidi is a great server. Very personable, attentive and funny! To the owner, know that she's an asset and you don't wanna lose her!   Love the Hot & Juicy flavor and mild. So good!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love seafood and this place is banging. Their sauce is so amazing and rice cooked so perfectly!! I had a pound of shrimp and a pound of crawfish with the hot and juicy sauce and it was to die for."}
{"text":"Awesome first time. Came here with the family. First time for everyone. Server Joann was great. Explained to us the menu, how to order and everything. We ordered \"the drool\"... it's a little bit of everything. 1lb of crawfish, 1/2lb crab, 1lb shrimp, a dozen of andouille sausage, 2 corns, 2 potatoes. We ordered in a mild spicy level. It was delicious the sauce is on point and they are not messing around with the spice level. It all had a prefect kick to it. Everything was so good we ordered more.... another pound of crab legs, 2 orders of calamari, & 1 pound of green mussels. Everything was delicious. We ordered 1 order of calamari regular and 1 Cajun. Definitely Cajun was way better. Also had a nice kick to it. Nothing special with the regular. Definitely a fun family experience. Everything wearing bibs, earring off the tables covered in plastic, eating with fingers, no utensils. It was awesome, unique and fun. Definitely will be back"}
{"text":"Our waitress Letisha (not sure if I'm spelling her name right) was great to our party of six, even when she was busy. Our order was right, never waited for refills. As for the food, shrimp, clams, and crawfish in hot n juicy sauce spicy was delicious. Get the Cajun fries! Yummm."}
{"text":"Ok so I've been to the Westgate Hot N Juicy twice now. One if my wife's favorite restaurants to we will be going even more seeing the Westgate location is much closer than the Mill ave one.   I've given the Mill location a 5 star rating. Westgate gets 4 based only on the service. That understandable seeing it's brand new. They just haven't gotten the service thing down as of yet. From working in the service industry way back when..I can understand how it takes a little bit for things to run smoothly.   Came last night on a Monday and was quoted 1.5 hours wait!! I would normally just walk off but after looking around I knew it was shorter. I was explained that half of the restaurant is closed due to lack of servers. Saw I. A previous Yelp review that something was said like that to the, as well. Maybe Hot N Juicy is having trouble hiring or keeping qualified servers??    I was right, our wait was a little bit more than 35 mins,,,just enough time to run to Yard House for a drink before our dinner. We had two servers at first, then one after our order was taken. Both of them were friendly. We ordered lb of clams, lb of snow crab and crawfish étouffée.   Man the clams and crab was amazing. Both in Hot N a Juicy med flavor which is my favorite!! Not too hot, but hot enough to feel the heat after the meal.   The crawfish étouffée wasn't good this time around. Way too oily. We ordered it on our last time here and it was great, but after this experience I will probably choose not to order it. I would have sent it back today but the funny thing was that we got asked how we were doing repeatedly before our food, but couldn't find anyone while we were eating. I finally had to flag down a server for extra water and I thought I would confuse him too much so we just pours out the extra oil and filled it up with hot n juicy sauce and mad it even better!   The food was amazing, price point not bad at all..the only thing lacking is the service, but I'm sure that will get better when they can hire more. I really think Hot N juicy will be here for the long haul and we will be back!"}
{"text":"I'm so happy a place like this is here in Phoenix!  I've heard so much about HnJC in Vegas but never experienced it till it came to Mill Ave. we came here on a Friday night and surprisingly it wasn't too busy. We sat down right away and were explained the process. Basically everything was served by the pound, then you pick your spice level. Med was good enough for me!   We ordered a pound of crawfish. We were warned that it had been frozen and not fresh so it was only $7 a pound. I haven't tried actually eating crawfish whole before so I had to order it. We also had shrimp, and clams,,  I was a little surprised when we got our food. It was basically a bag and they provide you a bib and gloves. Make sure you use the gloves or you will get spic all up in your fingernails!  Went for the shrimp first. You have to de-peel them but they were outstanding! Clams were great too but the crawfish was just ok. I won't order frozen crawfish again so hopefully next time I come they are fresh!!   All in all we really enjoyed this place. Food was great and it was very reasonable prices. Even the craft beer was only $3 so you can't beat that. I just saw they are going to open up one at Westgate in Glendale so that will be closer to me but I'm sure we will find our way back at this location before the west side one even gets finished.lol."}
{"text":"Hands down the BEST and ONLY location I go to. The service and their food is second to none. We ordered the dungenous crab (spicy, hot n juicy), 2 pounds of crawfish (spicy, hot n juicy), order of fries and an order of rice. (gotta have some rice) :) We love spicy food and their 'spicy\" was pretty dang legit. Oh and btw, they have Stella....ON TAP!  Parking can be tricky. Come early. We came around 5pm on a Friday night and had no issues finding parking or a table.  This place is definitely outside of the strip, they have a location on the strip, but this location is worth driving to or getting an Uber to. No bad meals given here!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat. It's not too expensive it's pretty quick and the service is good !"}
{"text":"Came on game day. Buffalo wild wings had a long wait so decided to try this place and I'm soooo glad we did! Got sat right away and food came out fast. They had game day drink specials and the food was awesome."}
{"text":"Robyn, my future daughter-in-law had her trepidations about bringing me to Hot 'n Juicy Crawfish... In the past few years, virtually every place she thought I would like turned out to me... just Average, at best... And she heard from my youngest kids, that Dad doesn't like to touch his food - which is mandatory at Hot 'n Juicy.  When your Pound of either Blue Crab, Shrimp, or Crawfish is brought out in it's plastic bag... the Plastic Bib and the Paper Towels are definitely not enough \"protection\" to prevent yourself from getting MESSY! In fact, I'm proud to admit after the four of us finished the 2 pounds of combos - we had the largest remnants of \"stuff\" by far of anyone dining that evening.  You'll receive a free Cob of Corn and a small Potato with every 2 Pounds of stuff ordered. But, I recommend more - just for the fact that you'll have something pretty neutral to offset the HEAT from the Crawfish.  Hot 'n Juicy's recommendation of how to eat Crawfish is:  1) Gently twist the head apart from the tail.  2) Take the head and SUCK the juice from inside.  3) Peel away 2 to 3 segments of shell from the tail to expose more meat.  4) Pinch the bottom end of the tail while carefully pulling the meat out of the shell.  I have a few modifications to this procedure... Why would I suck on a Crawfish head when I don't do it to it's bigger cousin Lobster? That just.... SUCKS! I break off the tail from the head section and only retrieve the meat from the tail section.  The absolute best value is the Shrimp... I treat the Shrimp at Hot 'n Juicy like the Salt & Pepper Shrimp that is prepared at Chinese restaurants. I consume the tail section, shell and all - it's just too much work trying to de-skin the Shrimp! When Robyn heard that --- Eww!  Robyn's recommendation: Order a pound of Blue Crab Legs and a pound of Shrimp.  Kevin and Kathy's (my daughter) suggestion: Crawfish and Shrimp.  My suggestion: After a Crawfish & Shrimp combo... I'd go for a Shrimp and Shrimp...  Suggestions for sides - Bread Rolls, Potatoes, Sausages are OK. Corn on the Cob, which is boiled along with the Crawfish literally turns into Cream of Corn - way too soft.  And... don't Breathe and Eat at the same time! Took me a few minutes to recover from the HEAT going down! Kevin tried some of my Spicy Crawfish and subsequently devloped a heat reaction - blotches of red all over his face and neck. I think for most - Spicy is hot enough.  Robyn was totally shocked when I gave Hot 'n Juicy a Yelper rating of 5-Stars - despite that fact that you can't avoid getting Messy here and despite scrubbing down with virtually all the Soap in the restroom afterwards and returning home probably needing a Bath / Shower... you can't help but have a pretty good time!  I can't think of a more enjoyable time to spend a couple of hours people watching - customers or your dinner companions getting down n' dirty with the Crawfish, or just to lower your own clean-freak inhibitions.  I was wondering why this restaurant was located in the un-officially designated Chinatown along Spring Mountain... So far as I could see that evening, there was only one waitress of Asian descent... I queried our waitress whether Hot 'n Juicy was Asian-owned - she replied that the owner was Thai and resided in Texas and was the second Crawfish place he owned.  Highly recommended by one who abhors using his dainty fingers....   I do have one last thought though.... What exactly is the chemical reaction of flash boiling on a Plastic Bag? Are there any chemical breakdowns of the Plastic Bag that the USDA should be worried about?"}
{"text":"Good option for Louisiana style seafood in the middle of the desert if that's your thing.    I've been to several places like Hot N Juicy and its is on par with previous experiences.  They serve everything from clams to crawfish to crab legs and chicken wings.  Each entree can be served with a combination of different sauces like garlic butter, hot n juicy, Cajun, lemon pepper, etc.  Additionally, each sauce can be served mild, medium, hot, extra hot, etc.  I thought the sauces lacked a little of the flavor that I'm used to.  If you are craving seafood in the West Valley, its a definitely a good option...actually its probably the best option conveniently located at West Gate.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"Crawfish, Catfish, Calamari and all that other good stuff.  Something about the sauce at this place that makes it stand out above all the rest.  Really good food.  Only thing I would suggest, is to not wear any light colored clothing."}
{"text":"We go here every time we are in Vegas (at least once a year)....both a favourite of visitors like myself and locals like my family. The shrimp is juicy and tender. I think we only paid 11.99 / pound. Be careful of the sauce..the garlic can be very strong if you aren't used to it and the sauce can be super spicy...I case you're not a spicy loving eater.  The service is always great and the white rice on the side is a must!! Just and fyi, they refused to call us a cab back to the strip because they said that too many people call a cab and ditch the cab. As a result the cab companies have blocked out there business. You have to use your own phone which isn't that great because it was long distance for me. We waited about ten minutes instead and eventually we took a cab back to the strip that had just dropped off some diners at the restaurant. Good thing we were lucky because it's too far to walk back to the strip!"}
{"text":"Hot N Juicy } BC ANYDAY.  I'd come to eat here despite the summer weather.  There's a parking lot out front with tons of spaces, and the wait was short. Waitresses were super nice, we took awhile deciding what we wanted cause we had a big group and she let us take our time.  I personally feel like Hot N Juicy's taste is way better than BC.  I really wish they opened one in northern Cali!!!  I had a memorable time here and will never forget Hot N Juicy. I think we took the cab here from our hotel from the strip but going back was WORK. I totally forgot that cabs don't stop for you on the side of the road, but I didn't know that applied anywhere else too... SO... the whole group walked back to the strip all the way from Chinatown. It was CRAZY. I just knew what direction to walk towards and we literally walked on the freeway.   I would gladly do it again for Hot N Juicy though."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service from Faith our waiter,Hot n Juicy at Westgate location. She kept making sure that we enjoyed our food and had what we needed. The food is amazing! Very flavorful! Extremely spicy ans delicious. Really recommend coming here:)"}
{"text":"So yummy! Order their hot N juicy spicy for take out and it was perfect! 1 pound of shrimp with a bowl of rice. Took about 30 mins to get back home and everything was still great! Service was super nice too! And their spicy is pretty spicy!! But it's good!"}
{"text":"Hot N Juicy crawfish is my favorite place to visit when I am in Vegas. My boyfriend and I came here twice on our most recent trip.   The first time he ordered 2lbs of crawfish with Hot N Juicy medium and I ordered 1lb of crawfish and 1lb of crab legs Hot N Juicy spicy. Oh, let's not forget a basket of Cajun fries to share. Let's just say we were both sweating! The waiter said the spice level can vary based on the cook and my guess is the cook that night was heavy handed. We both enjoyed it, however, the service wasn't that great due to the crowd. The waitress apologized but I told her it was okay because we came for the food and not the service.  The second time we came we ordered the same thing only my boyfriend also got 1lb of blue crab. The food was once again great! The service was better and I am guessing it was because we came during lunch rather than the evening. The only thing I will say about the blue crab is that if you are not a professional at eating full crabs you may want to start with crab legs first. I watched my boyfriend eat it for the first time and it just seemed like so much work!  Overall I definitely recommend this place to anyone! I have never ate at another location so I can't speak for the others. I prefer this one because it is the original. However, there is another one right down the street.  Plenty of parking in the area, no waiting, always a correct order, and they provide gloves (I never use them) if you prefer not to get down and dirty."}
{"text":"Got the Spicy Crawfish Hot n Juicy style 2 pounds.... Loved it, so much flavor cant wait to go back and try the crab legs and shrimp."}
{"text":"After reading some Yelp reviews, I was really iffy about going here. It was my first time coming here with the boyfriend and man were we hungry.  First and foremost! Order TWO pounds of the Crawfish. If you order one, you'll be really sad. Like we were. Let the crustaceans sit in the juices for a while! You'll be really sad if you don't! And make sure you stick to mild if you like spice but not too much! Because mild is CRAZY spicy! Like, my nose is running and my lips are on fire spicy.  Other than that, service was quick and amazing and the fried calamari was thebomb.com"}
{"text":"I honestly dont see the hype unfortunately. My sister and I ordered 2 pounds of crawfish, Cajun sausage, corn fritters, and fried shrimp basket. The fries, Cajun sausage and corn fritters were amazing. The crawfish was definitely juicy and flavorful, I just didn't think that getting that tiny piece of meat was worth it all the work lol the shrimp basket- I was expecting a batter type but it was a cornmeal breading. Wouldnt get the crawfish again, but would definitely try something else."}
{"text":"This place was so good I made a yelp account just so I could leave my first review for them!    I had never been to a \"boil\" style place before and I gotta say it was awesome! The food was great (4 stars) but the service earned that extra fifth! If you do one food adventure in Vegas this is it!  I went at about 7 on a Saturday, and let me say the place was packed, I would definitely be more strategic next time!  But despite being run ragged, their whole staff were friendly, helpful, and attentive! They told me it would be about 20 minutes for a table, so when I got one in 15 I was quite happy!  Timothy, our server, was amazing.  Despite obviously having a lot on his plate he took the time to really go in depth with me about all of my questions when he found out it was my first time. He even put on a pair of gloves when we got our food and gave us a step by step on how to demolish our respective crustaceans!   Checked on us many times, made sure glasses were full, and gave us quite a few valuable honest opinions.   I wish I could have Timothy at every resturaunt!  The food!  DELICIOUS.  At Timothy's suggestion we had hot n juicy sauce on our crawfish and lemon pepper on our king crab and shrimp. Definitely the right choices!  I had the crawfish and crab mild level spicy, and I like spice!  It was definitely the right heat.  My partner had hers \"less than mild\", which is their secret lowest spice level, and for her sensitive palate it was perfect!    Order a variety, the crawfish is fun but not filling.   The king crab was great, but pricey, next time I'll stick to regular crab.    If you don't have them throw a corn on the cob in each bag you are cheating yourself, some of the best corn I've ever had.  The sauces are amazing, I definitely recommend asking your server what pairs best with each seafood.   The hot n juicy is awesome, but definitely spicier even t the same heat level.  If they open a HnJ in northern Cali, I hope the staff here considers moving out here! XD it'd be a privilege to eat with them again!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I went to get our hands dirty at Hot N Juicy. From reading previous reviews, we did have an idea on what to expect. Went on a Saturday evening and surprisingly didn't have a wait at all. We ended up odering oysters to start, king crab, snow crab and shrimp. Pretty good variety to test out. The crab was fresh and oooh so good. Gotta say I love that when you order spicy, it's exactly that. I was only slighly dissappointed on the waitress serving us, considering its pretty small, we had to flag her down a couple of times to get what we needed.  This is now officially my husband's weekly request!"}
{"text":"Once again my husband requested Hot N Juicy for dinner. I willfully agreed as I was wanting seafood as well. We called the original location... 25 min wait, called here...no wait, so of course we came here. Bigger location then the original, thus more seating and people. We had both the crab and shrimp. As always, taste is excellent. I make it a point to come in late and on a day when I know the next day I will not be out of the house because it will take at least 2 showers and 20 hand washings to get the scent out of your body. Don't get me wrong the taste is well worth it! The onle pet peeve that I had was that once again the waitress we had we practically had to chase down to get what we needed.I know that it gets busy, but having to flag them down sucks. Kinda makes you not want to order more and just ask for the check. I think next time, we will wait for a table at the original location. ."}
{"text":"Had the crawfish po boy.  There was not much crawfish on the sandwich and what was there was mostly fried batter.  My friend and I got the same dish and both got sick later that day.  Would never go back unless it's just for fresh shrimp or fresh crawfish as others seemed to enjoy these."}
{"text":"Both times I've dealt with the hostess she has been extremely unpleasant. I called in on Father's Day to see if they took reservations and she got an attitude with me and said \" we don't do that you'll have to come in and put your name on the list and wait, have a nice day bye\" and hung up before i could get a word in. So I decided to go somewhere else solely based on her poor attitude.  They need to put someone friendly and upbeat as the first point of contact, not someone who comes across as they hate their job and dealing with people. I can't wait until the angry crab opens in Peoria."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness this was just so savory and delicious!! My favorite crawfish place lol. Great staff, just wish there were more tables! You have to try this place! I had the hot and juicy crawfish (medium) my daughter had the mild, but it tasted the same to me? I'm gonna try the garlic butter next, can't wait!!"}
{"text":"^6 If you like seafood that's tasty, spicy & juicy this IS the place! First we were a little skeptical since the outside isn't appealing to the eye but forget about the cosmetic. It's clean & delicious!!!!  The spicy is REALLY spice so beware and take their advise....order 1 lower!!! Had 1lb king crab with corn in lemon butter @ spicy - enough and tasty! I think more would have been too much of the \"EXTREMELY RICH\"sauce!"}
{"text":"I ordered two pounds of fresh in season crawfish. When I asked what size they were I was told they were medium size. Well, the crawfish I got were about half bait size (2 - 2 1/2\") to field size (3- 3 1/2\"). There was one large crawfish in the whole bag. I also noted the there were approximately 6 that I could tell were previously dead ( tail meat fell apart, carapace crushed). I don't know about you but my definition of fresh crawfish is alive and kicking. I'll be back as I like the spices, just not for the crawfish. Oh, and they can't tell the difference between the mild spice and garlic butter seasoning.  Edit: the crawfish that I ordered were not purged or cleaned very well either."}
{"text":"Good food,  server was great, I think her name was Rachel. We had crab,  shrimp,  and lobster.  We had several flavors on each.  You definitely work for your food here,  so dress down and get ready to get your hands dirty!"}
{"text":"Experience:  I had been eyeing this place since I first moved here. Being a native Louisianaian, I was happy to see a spot that had crawfish.  I mean, I am a true head-sucking, tail-eating fool!!!  Most crawfish I have eaten has been a crawfish boil at someone's house.  Then some friends wanted to go to Hot and Juicy, and I definitely joined the party.   Service:  One of our friends at the table also worked here, so we were treated very well. Not really sure how the wait staff would be without our VIP.   Food:  Ok, I'm probably not the best person to critique the food, because I'm a little biased of what good crawfish is.  We did order a whole bunch of seafood for the table, because they have many other things...we had crawfish, crab legs, muscles, shrimp, and clams.   I started out with the crawfish...of course...and was immediately thrown off with the heavy garlicky almost sweet flavor of the boil it was in. I tried all the other seafood, but just did not care for this flavor no matter what the host.  The friend that works here suggested I order the Louisiana style, so I jumped all over that.  I ordered the crawfish extra spicy too!  It was much better than the original flavoring, but still not like home. I guess I'm just a crawfish snob.   Overall review:  I won't be back anytime soon.  I will save my crawfish cravings to be satisfied when I go home to Louisiana to see my kin folks."}
{"text":"I have not even gotten my food yet and I give this place five stars. Michael, who we commissioned to be our waiter was the best. I think he was the host or bus boy however he did a fantastic job of taking our order. Please standby for an update. We are presently at five stars based off of our customer service from Michael. Wait, he lied and said he was about to be off the clock and I now see him taking an order from someone else too so clearly he's not the \"bus boy\" what's going on? We are now at three stars I don't trust it. Update, he allegedly was describing the spice level at another table.   We ordered a shrimp Po boy, a softshell crab  Po boy, Cajun fries and black mussels. Our favorite was the shrimp Po boy because the seasoning on it was very nice and second is the black mussels."}
{"text":"Very good cajun fixin!  As soon as my wife & I landed in Las Vegas, we went straight to Hot N Juicy Crawfish and it was off da hook!!!  You'll love the entire experience here, the entire staff greets you when you come in and all of the waiters are always checking up on you (GREAT SERVICE!!!).  Now, on to the food.  We ordered the 2lbs. of Crawfish special (Garlic Butter & Hot N Juicy Special \"Spicy\"), cajun fries, hot rolls and Etouffee.  I've been to New Orleans and always loved Cajun/Creole food, but this place definately helps get your craving fixed in a hurry.  I absolutely loved the Etouffee and craved it everyday that I was there.  After trying Hot N Juicy, it will be a ritual to go straight here from the Airport once we arrive."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I ate there for a second time. They treated us like friends and family once again. Our waiter was very friendly and she checked on us periodically. Her knowledge of the menu was amazing and she had great suggestions. She told us to try the this delicious purple haze beer. We also tried the lobster for the first time. I was not expecting that. I'm for sure going to go there again."}
{"text":"Great seafood but just wish it wasn't that messy!  Been there a few times and tried the shrimps, crab, lobster and crawfish! Had the special in medium all the time."}
{"text":"This is the first time at this location and I'm writing this review solely based off the 15 minutes we've been sitting here with no service. Not only is it not busy today but no one has even acknowledged us since we sat down. Thanks for walking by, noticing we haven't had any food and ignoring our table completely. Thank you. Go to the Hot and Juicy down the street. Service is much better."}
{"text":"Definitely a fan--went back this trip, as I remembered this place from my last trip to Vegas.  I'll echo some of the other reviewers, if you go for dinner, go early, as the line builds up.  We were seated right away, at 5:30, but by 6:30, there was a line outside the door.  I had the crawfish and clams, medium spice, and my mouth was burning for a couple of hours after we left (and I am usually pretty tolerant of spicy foods).  I also made the mistake of touching my eye, even after washing my hands, it still burned badly.  Loved both the clams and crawfish.  My wife is not a crawfish fan, so she got chicken wings, which were apparently good as well."}
{"text":"Not sure if I came on a bad day but I wasn't impressed with Hot N Juicy Crawfish.  Read the great reviews about it but taste wise seemed mediocre and was lacking in flavor.  My bf and I ordered a pound of crab, shrimp and chicken wings with fries.  Probably a bit too much food for us but we wanted to try a little bit of each.  We ordered the hot & juicy sauce.  Yes it was pretty spicy but that's all it really was.  I felt like it lacked taste.    The service was good, however, and our waiter was attentive and checked up on our table every so often.  Pricing was average.. similar to what we'd pay for in Hawaii."}
{"text":"Checked this place out. They were out of quite a few of their menu items. Service wasn't great. Has the tell the waitress our order at least twice. Luckly we weren't at the table where she spilled the water all over the place. Seafood was cooked well. We ordered the garlic butter in Mild and it was super spicy. Maybe next time we'd order baby spice. Men's bathroom was a mess. I think we'll stick with Angry Crab."}
{"text":"My friend and I were so happy this spot was open late. Not only was the food amazing, the service was 5 star. I had only been going to boiling crab and have now found my new shrimp spot in Vegas. Ashley was so helpful and let us try some of the flavors to help us better decide what we wanted. The oysters were so fresh! What a great experience."}
{"text":"I would agree that this place is a little better than boiling crab, in flavor and in service. Would definitely come back here when I am visiting Las Vegas again."}
{"text":"I am not sure why I haven't wrote a review for this place, we have been coming here since it first opened. Hot n juicy and boiling crab has always been my favorite places to grab me a nice juicy pair of crab legs, or a whole crab or a bag of shrimp with rice and corn. With Last nights experience I will probably not be coming back for awhile. Let me tell you one thing I won't be missing! I won't miss spending an arm and a leg on the amount they charge for their seafood.  I have been eating crabs all my life and never discriminated on any of the crab clan including the blue crab (female ones are my fav)  So on with my experience: yesterday I decided on ordering the whole dungeon crab (per sons request) and as I was breaking that sucker open I saw some unfamiliar clear slime all inside the shell. I thought hmmmmm, must be some kind of fat. I was so caught in the motion of breaking my crab up for my son.  When I finally snapped the legs apart I saw the same thing on the inside of the body!  I was immediately alarmed! I've never seen this shit before in my life!  I told my husband WTF is this?  I sampled a piece and was so grossed out (mind you I don't like sushi) and Good Lord! I realized it was not cooked! The waiter happen to come in the nick of time and I showed him my broken up pieces, what the heck is this? I have never seen anything like this in my life! He was a little struck with shock, he then replied oh wow! That's not fully cooked!  So he basically confirmed it was raw! I was so grossed out!  But since my son wanted crabs so bad, I agreed to having another one fully cooked!   Can I just say this experience was probably one of the most difficult task in my life! Believe me I had plenty! But to Consume another Crab after that experience was unbelievably hard! I literally was forcing my self to eat my expensive crab.  Looks like I won't be eating Crabs or seafood for a very long time!  This morning I woke up with the reminder in my mouth and stomach!  Last night was ruff, I kept obsessing over my experience, and my thoughts took over, that I had to partake in google and researched my possible illnesses that could of occurred. As I read more into my research I have a possibility of symptoms occurring within 6months! WTF? Google was no help as I sat on my porcelain throne, pushing the night away. Overall: I was a little disappointed the way they handled my situation. The manager never came to my table and apologized or asked if their was anything they could do! The waiter apologized but also reminded me that it will take awhile to cook another one (which probably had more to do with them closing soon)  So overall, I hope I won't get sick with their neglect to properly cook seafood and I probably won't come back here for awhile. Which I am pretty bummed!  I love the sauces! The sides and shrimp! But after this experience, I won't be coming back for a very long time! I don't my stomach could handle it!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite stop when I'm in Vegas. For some reason, I like this location better. The crawfish is so good and spicy. Oh yes it burns! But it's the good kind of burn. I've had the shrimp, snow crabs and crawfish in the hot and juicy sauce. Try them all. It's the best sauce ever!"}
{"text":"The taste and atmosphere is real nice, food is great! A bit pricey but it is seafood so expect for seafood prices.  We waited about 10-15 mins as it was lunch time and busy, they are always busy but wait was worth!"}
{"text":"Went back with friends from out of town. Service is slow but food was delicious."}
{"text":"Had date night at Hot n Juicy in Westgate in  Glendale. First time here. A little bit of a wait bit it is a Saturday night so it's to be expected. Had a slight hiccup but rectified fast by the manager and server. It was phenomenal food, great atmosphere. Ask for Jordan Young to be your server, he was definitely above average waiter. All around A+ in all aspects from service to management and food."}
{"text":"Yes, it's worth the smelly seafood hands! My boo, his sister and I came here for a delicious dinner on a Sunday night. The wait was only about 15-20 mins which didn't seem super long to me. The service was quick and friendly. Our waitress was super helpful with any questions we had and explained all the spice levels to us. They also provide you with plastic gloves and bibs which I highly suggest using!   The food was awesome too! I personally am not a huge crawfish fan, but still enjoyed them because of the delicious seasoning. The shrimp was by far my favorite, very big and juicy. I also had a bite of the catfish po boy. It wasn't too fishy in flavor and was cooked perfectly. I can't wait to come back and try more!"}
{"text":"Finally popped my hot n juicy cherry! I've literally had this place bookmarked for years and I finally got around to checking it out. I went with a friend on a Sunday night and was able to get a table right away. The feel is definitely trendy and club like, they had some EDC music vibes going on. It was also nice that they had the football game on to cater to all the sports fans as well.  Now to the food! We ended up sharing the calamari, lemon pepper shrimp and hot n juicy crawfish. My favorite seasoning was the hot n juicy, it had the perfect balance of basically every flavor and tasted great with the crawfish, corn and potatoes we got. I do have to knock this place one star only for the amount of work it actually takes to eat the crawfish and shrimp. You have to man handle these bad boys pretty good to get the meat out and another sucky part is your hands smelling like seafood for a few days after. They provide you with plastic gloves, but it's honestly so much harder to try to break the food apart while wearing them. Can't win em all I guess.  Overall I'm super happy I finally stopped by and I'll definitely be back again soon. Can't wait to try something new!"}
{"text":"I can honestly admit I'm a lazy person when it comes to eating. Cutting a piece of meat with a knife and/or fork/spoon (when I'm even lazier) is probably the most strenuous work I'll tolerate. Using my fork or spoon is enough, isn't it?  The ONLY, I repeat ONLY, food I'll take time to carefully work at and eat is shellfish...specifically crab, lobster and crawfish. Unfortunately, being located in the Tri State area, there is a lack of crawfish which saddens me. Since I was in town for work I jumped at the opportunity to eat one of my favorite shellfish friends...crawfish!  After leaving the CES convention center, my colleagues and I hailed a taxi* and requested to go to Hot N Juicy located in Chinatown. A split second later, we realized Hot N Juicy sounded like a strip club so we joked around with the taxi driver and insisted it wasn't a peep show. We were going to that AFTER we ate.  My colleagues didn't know it but I was giggling like a little school girl when we arrived. Unfortunately for them, they aren't as adventurous when it comes to food so they ordered calamari, chicken wings and fries which they enjoyed.  Our waiter was extremely informative, briefly describing to us (mostly me) how to order the seafood (per pound), by seasoning and spiciness. Since I've been to Boiling Crab I already knew what I wanted...2 lbs of garlic butter crawfish with medium heat. The garlic butter seasoning is SO mouth wateringly good that I could drink it as a side (not recommended though). They serve the seafood in plastic bags with bibs and paper towels. This is the messiest meal you will ever eat but so worth it. I was in business attire but was able to leave without any stains!  As I twisted and separated the head and tail, sucked the head and pushed out the meat from the tail...my colleagues looked at me in complete disgust like I was a monster. Did I feel bad? Not at all. I easily finished the 2 lbs of crawfish like a true fatty. I ordered medium heat but my mouth was on fire pretty much the entire time I was eating so to counteract the heat, I took big swigs of beer which helped.   The seafood pricing on the menu says market price so be sure to ask the waiter beforehand. The crawfish was about $10 per pound. Currently, they're having a BOGO shrimp special because they opened up another Hot N Juicy location in Washington, DC. Do I hear a road trip?  My next visit will showcase their blue crab legs. If you're ever in Vegas or DC, I would highly recommend coming here if you're a seafood lover and don't mind getting messy. It's a freakin' dream.  A fun tip, Hot N Juicy was on Man vs. Food.  ------------------------------------  *In Las Vegas, taxis aren't allowed to pick up passengers on streets like NYC. They have to pull into a parking lot, hotel, restaurant, etc."}
{"text":"I've been to many Cajun/creole restaurants and this is by far at the top of the list! The seafood is so fresh and delicious! My man ordered the pound of snow crab legs with a cat fish basket, and I ordered the pound of black mussels. We both got it spicy with the hot n juicy sauce. Everything was perfect! They do have happy hour from 11-4 if you're interested, but only on drinks. Overall the service and food were absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"It doesn't matter if you go this one in henderson or the ones on spring mountain in china town, hot and juicy is the best food you'll get in all of vegas... At least as far as i am concerned.   It is messy, spicy, flavorful, saucy, fresh (and they will tell you when it becomes frozen crawfish time, a touch I appreciate) and delicious. The clams, crab legs, and shrimp are my favorite but you cant go wrong with anything they offer in any one of their awesome sauces.  This is literally my answer when someone asks me what my favorite food is: hot and juicy.  Love it!!"}
{"text":"Good. Seafood in a bag with gloves. Just be careful how hot you order it. I like spicy and I ordered mine \"medium\" but it was insanely hot. Overpowered the taste of the crab.  My fault. Service was good too."}
{"text":"Hot n Juicy came up after Boiling Crab became such a hit. Seeing them on Man vs Food back in the day made me really want to try it. I had such high hopes for them but it was a let down.   Decent amount of seating. Located in Chinatown. Service was good.  Hot n Juicy style was supposed to be a flavor bomb but it was lacking. None of the flavors popped, not even the garlic. Whole Shabang from BC has a lot more flavor.   Shrimp - $14.99 per pound Crawfish - $12.99 per pound  The seafood does come frozen. But the batch we got was terrible. The meat ended up being really mussy. It lost all its bite.   Big disappointment."}
{"text":"Just finished having dinner here with my friend. First time trying this place out and we will most definitely be back! I ordered 2 lbs of shrimp (with medium Hot N Juicy seasoning!) while my friend ordered the Soft Shell Crab basket.  One word: Amazing!  The seasoning on the shrimp was just perfect and the basket was way better than I expected it to be. I was skeptical of the soft shell crab basket since I've never had anything of that sort. However, once I tried it, I realized how wrong I was. The batter used to fry the soft shell crab gave it a very delightful taste and the consistency was nice and tender!  Overall a wonderful first experience at Hot N Juicy. The prices are quite reasonable and the customer service was top notch. Big \"Thank You\" to our server, Max, for being patient with us and answering all our inquiries. He was always attentive and was reachable at a glance. Really made an already-awesome dining experience just that much better."}
{"text":"Absolutely the WORST experience I've ever had in a restaurant in my life! The food took so long to come out then an additional 20 minutes just to receive my bill and charge me. THEN your waitress has the NERVE to follow me to my car and yell at me \" did you just try to steal the money off the next table\" EXCUSE ME I have never been so disrespected and humiliated in my life like your waitress and restaurant made me feel! I make $110 k a year in timeshare I don't need your little waitress money. This WAS my families favorite restaurant and I will be taking this to corporate!"}
{"text":"Excelente restaurante. comida maravilhosa, preço honesto e atendimento espetacular. Recomendo. e voltarei com muita, mas muita fome mesmo."}
{"text":"Let me say this first, we didn't have a bag of seafood, which seems to be their main item.  I'm not a crawfish fan, and don't like crab in the shell (unless they're stone crabs, which most places around here do not carry) or oysters.  That being said, I also have an issue with food that can look at me.  Anyway, hubby really wanted to check out this place, so we decided to try it.  However, since the baskets are also on the menu, I would assume they should be just as tasty as anything else.  We started with the corn fritters, which are more like corn nuggets.  I think of fritters as being a little bigger...but, they were very good.  Like little bites of corny goodness.  They were better without the mayo sauce they served with them.  We both ended up getting the fried shrimp baskets...hubby with their cajun fries, me with regular fries.  Now, herein lies the problem we both seemed to have.  The shrimp batter is really crunchy, but there's way too much of it.  The shrimp are butterflied, which flattens them out.  All I tasted was \"crunch\".  The shrimp definitely weren't being tasted and, unfortunately, the batter had no flavor.  I attempted to peel off some of the batter, but that didn't seem to help much...still no flavor.  The fries were decent, but hubby didn't realize his would be so spicy.    That being said, the service was good.  Our waitress was very friendly and fun to talk to."}
{"text":"This was the best crab I have ever had. I'm a wimp when it comes to spice and I got the Louisiana flavoring with \"Baby Spice\" and it was amazing! The staff was super attentive and sweet, made sure we were taken care of the whole time. We are from out of town and next time we come back to Phoenix we will definitely be going again. Can't say enough good things about this place! You need to try it!"}
{"text":"I finally made it!!!!  I took my friend Derek, as we have been pursuing the spiciest foods in Vegas and had yet to be happy with the results.  We had excellent service here (5 different waitstaff helping us out and refilling our iced teas, cleaning trash, feeding Derek's sugar packet habit, etc).    We got the soft shell crab basket to start since Derek never had it before.  It was a bit overfried but tasty, and the cajun fries were tasty.  For the meal we had 1 lb hot n juicy medium shrimp, 1 lb hot n juicy spicy crawfish, 1 lb hot n juicy extra spicy crawish, and corn + potato + rice.  The conclusion: the shrimp were large, juicy, flavorful and tasty.  The spicy crawfish was our favorite - not too hot but the spice added up enough to give us that delicious burning flavor on the tongue and runny nose/watery eyes.  The flavor also was great.  The extra spicy crawfish had a nice intense spice, but the butter and overly powdered seasoning muddled the flavor.    The corn and rice were nice \"neutralizers\" - next time we go here we would get the spicy level with anything.  A fun, messy, bib-ilicious experience!  and yes, I felt like a garlic breathing dragon all day!"}
{"text":"I would had given a 4 star but unfortunately I had to take away one star for the customer service. The waitress took my order, brought my order to me and never came back. I ran out of water because the heat level was so hot.  It's always nice to stop by Hot N Juicy whenever it's available. It's always a great experience with delicious cajun food. It is more on the pricey side but it is an experience that you will never forget.  I usually go for the shrimp, sausage and corn combination. I always feel like the crab legs are over price here. If it's your first time here, start with a low heat level because it can get really really really hot."}
{"text":"wow, what a place. good atmosphere, cute servers and real good food. Unique distinct flavors. Get the spicy and you will find your nose running and sniffing while trying to eat and suck Crawfish and shrimp. But the spicy flavors have you wanting eat another piece after piece... and to be honest you know a place is real good when most of the customers consist of different races...there were a lot of Asians, Blacks and White customers... meaning people of different cultures can find a common ground when it comes to good food and the portions were good and price very reasonable...oh and did I mention cute and friendly waitresses? one criticism, they were out of fresh crawfish..c'mon what the heck? that is the only reason this is 4 out of 5 otherwise 6 out of 5"}
{"text":"holy sh*t, i love this place.!!  literally, sh*t... frankly, having this as one of my favorite digs defies common logic as i KNOW eating here will make me sh*t like crazy later.!  *NOTE this is the same review for their new restaurant.   the only difference is layout.   the service, price, and quality of food does not diminish from one place to the other.  TIME SPENT once a week @ Lunch/Dinner times.  LAYOUT HJnC seems to be a chain and, for Vegas, this location is the older of the two found in Chinatown.   unlike their newest store, this location has more of a \"dive-in\" look.   it's an open space look with squared tables and 2/3 half moon shaped booth seating towards the back.     i've stopped coming to this location ever since the new one opened, but i recall the VERY long lines to get in.   they have a couple of seats to help with the waiting inside, but those fill up quick, and so it leads to many customers sitting around randomly (sp.?) outside.  also note that ths location has LIMITED parking.!   customers tend to park around a adjacent neighborhood or at the shopping center over (tow warning).  this issue may be gone with the new store opening...   but, garunteed - HJnC is always crowded nonetheles.^^  SERVICE no matter which HnJC you're at, the service is OUTSTANDING.   people are cheerful and conversational.   not only do servers ask what you need, but EVERYONE who works there will also eventually ask what you need.  FOOD there's an arguement here on how good the food is.   as i rave about the taste, my southern friends disagree that it's better back home.^^;  my one CON is the Snow Crab's \"freshness\" being on par with local buffet quality.   i found the shell soft and flavor off (sauce saves it).    you are basicly paying $16 a 1ib for something you can pay $24 and eat without limit at a buffet ($15 @ Rio's World Buffet as a local).  i have ALOT of friends who don't like shellfish, so can recommend their sweet-potato fries, shrimp etouffe (sp.?), battered shrimp, and battered catfish as alternate foods...  all of which, i don't order, but highly enjoy stealing from those who do.^^  PRICING on average, i eat 6-8ibs of various items (crawfish, clams, snow crab) which normally run $50-$80.   i've had friends do 1-2 ibs of things and spend $20ish...  maybe that'll give you a rough idea.  CLOSING HnJC will leave you with a lasting impression.  the service and welcoming you recieve there make it feel like you're eating at home with friends.   it also doesn't hurt that all the waitresses are gorgeous to boot.^^   it's as if they the catalogue of Suicide Girls were waitressing the establishment.!  TIPS 1.  SAUCES: please don't bother with getting anything under SPICEY.   the seafood just tastes bland otherwise.    EXTRA SPICEY will make you cry. 2.  Wear clothes u don't care about so you don't have to wear those ridiculous looking bibs...  some people go as far as wearing hamburger helper gloves to eat.!   please save yourself the embarrassment of looking stupid. 3.  i like to save whatever sauces is left over and pour them into one bag to go.   i know - it sounds YUCK...  but the sauce is great with everything you cook.   Omelletes (sp.?), over dry noodles with egg, etc."}

{"text":"Has to try this place out after seeing it on Man vs Food on the Travel Channel. It was really busy and they needed more staff that day but after talking to them afterward they were surprised by the rush that day. The Crawfish was really good. Ordered both the spicy and medium but I would say go with the medium I eat hot but it was spicy for me.   Great new is that they are opening one in Seattle where I live. Ya!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time during lunch. Had the shrimp, king crab and lobster all \"Hot and Juicy\" flavor.  The food was excellent but messy as can be!  I have to say the best was the king crab and then the shrimp.  The lobster was great but took a lot of work to break it up and access the tail.  Overall, the service was great and attentive and they helped to explain how the menu works.  Overall, a great experience and I look forward to going back to try it again!"}
{"text":"Went out for a late night dinner with the family and we found this place! the first thing u notice is that mouth watering smell! We ordered shrimp crab legs and crawfish. The oyster are fresh and delicious.Their hot n juicy flavor is very tasty and full of flavor! The servers are really nice and helpful. Great customer service i should say! Everybody is pretty much satisfied after the meal! Will definitely coming back to this place!"}
{"text":"Joanne helped us out and she made the experience so amazing in top of the food. She constantly checked in on us and i cant wait to come back for the amazing shrimp and fries. Great pricing too!"}

{"text":"YUMMY!!!!! good service!!!! the hot and juicy special sauce is the best. if you dont wanna wait for too long, better come before 5. The chicken wings and cajun fries are good too."}
{"text":"came to check out the new location and it wasnt great experience. everytime that we wanted to order something more or refill our drinks, it took them forever to come to our table. and the sauce was kinda different compared to the one on the other location ( i like the other one better)."}
{"text":"Best seafood on the strip. They have a great flavor and a good selection of seafood. Very laid back atmosphere. The shrimp comes served in a bag and they give you gloves and a bib. So you don't get covered in their delicious juices. Will definitely be back again. DELICIOUS!!!"}
{"text":"Chicago NEEDS a Hot N Juicy!  I'm a seafood lover and this is my cloud 9!   Fresh seafood seasoned in their garlic and butter sauce, yummmmmmm!   I can eat Hot N Juicy everyday, but would probably have to limit it to once a week on those days where I make the least amount of human contact as the garlic stench in my breath can make it difficult for me to communicate.  We had 2lbs crawfish, 2lbs shrimp, and king crab. Everything was delicious! I highly recommend getting a side of rice or extra potatoes and corn.  The other stuff like the fried catfish or calamari were meh so I would stick to the non-fried items. Also the sausage isn't worth it.  Great service, plenty of napkins and water, so why not go for it and get the very spicy?"}
{"text":"I love crawfish and coming from the Midwest you don't get to experience real delicious crawfish. Hot N Juicy was reccommended by a few friends that found this gem while visiting Vegas and being a big seafood lover I said it was a must.  So glad I tried it! We ordered 3lbs of *spicy* seasoned crawfish, spicy sausage, and white rice. They weren't kidding when they said SPICY. My nose was running and my eyes were tearing up, but I kept eating because it became an addiction to me. That hot n juicy of it was so powerful I couldn't let go.  We had great service, all 3 of the employees that serve was were friendly.  I wish we had a HOT N JUICY in CHICAGO! Yummmm!"}
{"text":"Food is good but service is lacking. Hot N Juicy is one of my favorite places to eat while in Las Vegas so I was excited when they brought one of their locations to Arizona. Unfortunately, the AZ employees don't make it the experience it is in Las Vegas. The portion sizes of the sides are smaller at this location and the marinade is a little watered down. I won't be back to this store."}
{"text":"Hot N Juicy Crawfish defines diamond in the rough. It doesn't look good from the outside and the inside isn't all that great either but the food...oh, the food. Make this pit stop a must stop pitstop on your next trip to Vegas. I recommend the shrimp with Hot N Juicy sauce. Ask them to throw in some corn on the cob - they cook it right in the bag and it's amazing. Their cajun fries are delicious. I'll admit, I ask for the gloves. It makes clean up a little easier. Don't forget the bib!"}
{"text":"Love this place, be ready to be messy. Good food, good prices, good vibes..  Spent the Labor Day weekend here with my family being out of town temporarily because I am stationed in central cal, and the ONLY DOWN FALL of this place is that they do not offer military discount, otherwise it would be 5 stars."}
{"text":"I went here so long ago... 2 years ago to be exact... but I can still remember how good this place was!  We ordered crawfish, king crab legs and shrimp and everything was a delicious mess!  At the time service was fairly quick on a Saturday afternoon and it wasn't crowded at all.  I dunno if things have changed in the last 2 years... judging from everyone's reviews... it seems like it's gotten better!"}
{"text":"Ordered a pound of shrimp with the juicy Cajun flavored mild and it was excellent. I also got a corn with it as well and though it was overcooked the flavoring on it was delicious. Im definitely coming back to branch out to something like the crawfish or clams. I ordered take out so I dont have much to say about thd service other than it was ready right when they said it would be."}
{"text":"I came in today as I was craving this place for a long time, we drove from Cali.   First the place wasn't as busy as we expected which was nice and we were seated right away. Our server came around her name I believe was Michelle, we ordered our drinks and food. We ordered 1lb of shrimp, 1/2 lb of sausage 4 corns and  potatoes with a side of rice.   As we were patiently waiting we get our food and as excited we were we started eating, at this point I didn't get my rice or the sausage in the bag, we flagged Michelle and advised her of the missing items, she then comes back and brings the rice.    Finally we are almost done and yet still no sausages were brought nor do we get her to come by for refills on our drinks or to let us know what's taking so long, we become frustrated and my husband gets up and goes to the servers and tells them to forget about it, we then have Michelle come by with our bill and says I took it off the bill.   At this point we didn't say anything to her as we were annoyed.  I wasn't expecting a free meal but a decent I sincerely apologize for the delay but I guess that's too much to ask. I give this place a 2 stars for poor service. Food was great.   If you want good food come by, but in my opinion not worth my money, service honestly makes the experience all that better. Such a disappointment!"}
{"text":"SNOW CRAB: great! great quality snow crab meat, sauce was good.  CRAWFISH: surprisingly, not as big, juicy, and flavorful as the no-name place down the street."}
{"text":"This place sucks with customer service! Would never would go back there again when visiting Vegas from Cali. The girl who took my order never came back to ask if everything was ok or did any of them came and fill up my water as I was there alone and not with a date or anyone with me. They totally ignored me the whole time until I flagged them down to asked for them for something like the salt, black pepper, & lemon supposed to come with the order  and more water. They sold me frozen crawfish and told me they were live and fresh. They lied bc the live and fresh ones are fleshy, juicy, red, hard and not black, soft or don't fall apart and in the entire one pound bag were all small ones except for one huge one on there when are served in the bag. I was completely disappointed!"}
{"text":"This is more of a service review than anything else. I love hot n juicy, it's always a great good quality experience. They're always on point with the seafood and the spice level. I'm not throwing any complaints to that. It's great!   This is more about how slow things took with getting out meal out and how long the gap was between food and our check to even cashing it out.   My first issue was that we ordered mozzarella sticks and fries with 2lbs of shrimp and we got each item one at a time. Our shrimp orders came out first and then about twenty minutes I asked the server about our fries and mozzarella sticks and they had to double check our order. It continued to take another 15 minutes to get our fries and mozzarella at this point we had finished our shrimp and just took the fries and sticks to go. It was such a bad relay from ordering to receiving it really ruined the experience.   An added fact to the ruined experience was that an action that should take only a few minutes took over 15 minutes. We asked for a check and to go boxes and it took an unnecessary amount of time to receive our check. I understand it was a Friday night and it gets busy. But an expedited process to get your check and cash out is key to a quick turnover and getting your wait down when you have one. I really wish it didn't take as long as it did to get everything situated.   Step up your game hot n juicy"}
{"text":"YYYYYYYYYYYuuuuuuuuuuummmmmmmmmmmm!!!!!  I love crawfish, shrimp, cajun fries and lots of mess!   It helped reading all the reviews on yelp on hot n juicy crawfish. There are a couple places in nor cal for crawfish but not in vegas but this place is pretty good. i've never seen crawfish so big ever.  The flavor was great, we order 2 pounds of crawfish hot n juicy special medium spicyness, and 1 pound of shrimp hot n juicy special medium spicyness cajun fries rice and 8\4 beers between the two of us.  I wouldn't mind going back tomorrow if my fiancee lets me eat it again tomorrow  You must try!"}
{"text":"I love the new location! Our second time visiting in 2 weeks. This location is way bigger than the 1st location and right down the street. Same great service, great food."}
{"text":"The shrimp, soft shell crab, Cajun fries, sweet potato fries, wings, and catfish were all delicious.  David was attentive, and his excellent service made our dining experience wonderful."}
{"text":"There was a 15 - 20 minute wait and this was expected. The ambiance is very casual at Hot N Juicy. It's also very loud on a Friday night, but I presume it's loud here on every evening. I am a huge fan of eating with my hands and I do love myself a \"different\" eating experience, so I am a little sad to be giving this location its rating. It had been my first time dining at this location and the other, I was very fond of. The food had noticeably less flavor, sweet potato fries were a little burnt, our server misheard an order or two of ours, but they handled it fairly well and my party was grateful for that. I really do prefer the other location, but the food is good and it's a great place to go to with friends."}
{"text":"Very different experience than I imagined. Spices were good. Eclectic atmosphere. Definitely a spot where a young hip crowd can kick back, relax, eat, drink and have fun with friends. I would try it again next Vegas visit."}
{"text":"Today we gorged ourselves on a bounty of seafood. At noon on Sunday, it wasn't too busy and there were only a handful of people in the restaurant. In addition to the sauce-laden seafood they also serve fried baskets and sides such as potatoes, corn, and fries.   We ordered 2 pounds of shrimp, 1 pound of clams, 1 pound of green mussels, and 1 pound of snow crab. Quite a feast! We also had a corn cob each, which was thoroughly soaked in the hot and juicy sauce for maximum flavor. We ordered each seafood in a different sauce, with the hot and juicy sauce being my favorite, and the cajun sauce my second favorite. Out of all the seafood, the snow crab and shrimp were the best. The clams were large and had a lot of meat to them, but they were a bit chewy. Same could be said for the mussels. We ordered every item as \"medium\" spicy which was just right for us.   Service was good for refilling drinks and providing extra gloves. The kitchen was on the lethargic side though as it took some time to get various parts of our meal out.  Overall a good experience!"}
{"text":"Warning: Do not wear your best clothes here, and come here prepared to get disgustingly messy, but it's worth it!  With that being said, come here to get fresh live crawfish!  I got a pound of house special marinated crawfish, and lemon pepper marinated shrimp to go.  The crawfish and the sauce was delicious.  The crawfish meat was cooked perfectly, and the sauce was rich and spicy.  The lemon pepper sauce was also very good, but the shrimp, while big, didn't taste as fresh, since the meat was a little mushy where you take the head off the shrimp.  I asked the waitress how hot the \"medium\" spice level was at, and she said 8/10, soo... I opted for \"mild\" which was just right: not too spicy that I won't enjoy the meal, but had just enough kick to prove quite tasty."}
{"text":"This was my fourth time in Vegas in the past couple of years and I was there for several days.  I realized that my previous Las Vegas trips have been Strip-Centered.... (I mean \"the\" strip, NOT strip club you dirty minded perv) Regardless I decided this trip to focus my eating on off-the-strip meals and activities and found Hot N Juicy Crawfish.  I had never eaten in a \"Boil\" style fish place.   I had also not eaten Crawfish so this was a perfect experience.   I ordered a sampler which had Crawfish, Shrimp, Andouille Sausage, Potato and Corn on the Cob.   They asked my spice level and I said medium, always seems perfect for me.   I got a beer too although the one beer that appealed to me the most was discontinued.     The meal arrived and it was an impressive amount of food.   Wearing the provided gloves I negotiated the slippery crustaceans and quickly mastered the fine art of beheading and shelling the little bugs.    As I popped them in my mouth they proved to be the freakin' hottest things I have ever eaten!  Holy crap they were spicy.   The fact that my lips were chapped from the dry Las Vegas air multiplied the spice ten fold and my lips went from cracked to blistered.  I begged the server to find me some Chapstick and started looking around the room for moms with large purses...    The waitress said that their heat scale might be a little on the aggressive side and suggested that next time I go with mild or even their wimpy beginner heat level of \"Baby-mild\"   Honestly I might just have to start there.     After all of this why five stars?  Because it was so damn fun!!!   And in spite of the heat it was truly delicious and the portion was more than generous.   I would 1000% recommend it but please communicate with your server exactly what your heat tolerance might be."}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY AMAZING.  I came to Vegas, with the saying \"what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas\" Well I cant express how much I love this place and how yummy the crawfish, shrimp, mussels, and sweet potato fries were.   Great service, they were very quick and attentive. The food was amazing packed with flavors, definitely better than boiling crab. Their sauce comes with chopped potatoes that absorbs all of the flavor from the sauce, yummy...  The shrimp: big, hot, and juicy. haha the shrimp tasted fresh and did I mention juicy? Crawfish: I am not a big fan of these little critters because it takes so much effort just to eat the little meat they have. But these guys here are pretty big.  mussels: my favorite! you guys gotta order these!  sweet potato fries: crispy on the outside soft and sweet in the inside (:   Definitely have to come back here again while I am in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Being a \"foodie\" and a an avid food network and travel channel junkie, I totally had to make a stop at this piece.  After seeing the Vegas Man vs. Food edition I attempted to do up some crawfish myself.  It was alright, not great.  So I had to go this place just to taste it.  Man oh man.  It was awesome.  I had 2lbs of medium hot and juicy special with potatoes and a sapporo.  Service was great, place was crowded at 5pm on a Friday night.    My only disappointment was that there was no bar.  I went there by myself and I felt bad taking up a table for four by myself.  Also, more TVs would have been nice...you know for those who dine alone.  Overall a good experience and wallet-friendly."}
{"text":"Ok, the only reason why this place gets 4 stars is because this was my first experience going to any crawfish spot and I have no where else to compare it to.  PROS: The shrimp was ridiculously good and damn spicy like I like it, crawfish was yummy too. Being a newbie I would say my first time was memorable =)  CONS: Service was a bit whack at first but nothing major to bring the place down. I had to keep asking for water and my cousin had to re-order her shrimp because they didn't ask her what kind of sauce she wanted. Luckily, the rest of us were hungry and ate her order, and she re-ordered... so, it worked out!  Beware! I was hurting after this... good lawd! If you plan on going to a club that night... make sure you go HOURS and HOURS before or else you're gonna have to go when you have to go. LOL.  FINAL ANSWER: Go because it will suffice your craving!"}
{"text":"Just celebrated my birthday here. Had a pound of shrimp, pound of snow crab, fried shrimp, and dinner rolls. Fairly priced, tasty seasoning, great atmosphere and service. Would come back again and recommend to my friends."}
{"text":"Gave this place another chance.  Tried to come here for my birthday a few months ago, only to face a 45 minute wait, a trip to their 2nd location, a waitress dumping a full soda on our table and finding out there was no crab - blue crabs, Dungeness crab, snow crab , king crab - NONE at all - only when our server took our order.  This time, I called ahead and yes, they had crab available.    Pros -   No wait at 6:15 on a Friday night Beverages refilled promptly Servers were friendly Food was good  Cons -  Two of us ordered Dungeness crab; and server gave each of us a claw cracker tool, and that was it.  No fork, no pick, not even a butter knife or even one of those \"sea sheller\" plastic gadgets.  How did they expect anyone to eat crab without any other tools?  One of us ordered the lobster, and he did get the sea sheller tool.  When I asked for two more, the server said she wasn't sure if they had more, but she would look!  Come on, it's a SEAFOOD restaurant, and you can't give your customers something as simple as a plastic tool to open crab legs?  She did manage to bring two more to our table.  Only the crawfish included corn & potatoes.  I can understand not including sausage with boiled seafood, but one tiny potato and half an ear of corn for three people added $4 to our bill.  How hard could it be to just include this in every boiled seafood menu item?  Petty money grab, IMO. And . . .  Sausage, corn and potatoes were brought to the table 10 minutes before we got our seafood.  They were cold by the time we ate them with our seafood.  Marinara sauce with mozzarella sticks from appetizer menu was cold.  Seasoning description on menu could have had more information.  I have no idea what was in \"Juicy Cajun\" or \"Louisiana Style\" - White pepper?  Black pepper?  Red pepper?  Paprika?  No clue whatsoever with no information in the menu, and server didn't know either.  Parking lot is too small for the capacity of the restaurant.    If you go - Call ahead and ask if they have the seafood you want Park on the street If you plan on ordering crab, bring your own crab tools Tell your server to bring the corn and potatoes with your seafood."}
{"text":"Found out about this place from MVF.  This place is awesome.  Service is much better than The Boiling Crab in Cali.  I actually like the seasoning here better as well.  Whatever seasoning I choose, I always ask them to not make it spicy; as mild as possible, yes I am a wuss.  Though crawfish is in their name, go for the shrimp because that is the best bang for the buck.  There is more meat and you do not have to fight for the little meat that you get in the crawfish.  The cajun fries are tasty also.  Pros: great service, great food  Cons: small parking lot  Definitely a place to stop by while in Vegas.  It is not really too far off the strip."}
{"text":"My favorite of all time. When I'm craving for something spicy and fun to eat, I go for hot n juicy. I always order side of extra spicy sauce and rice with my shrimps. I love snow crab legs because we get more legs than when we order king crabs. Corn and sausage and corn flitters yummy"}
{"text":"MAN do i LOVE this place :). Finally, a restaurant that KNOWS spicy. Be ready to get down and dirty! They provide you with bibs, plenty of paper towels, and wet naps because you will be splashing sauce everywhere and using a lot of your hands.  I recommend the shrimp and lobster. Of course the lobster is the most expensive; however, once in a while it's SOOO worth the money. The clams are fantastic as well. My regular order is a pound of shrimp and a pound of snow crab legs EXTRA EXTRA spicy with 2 corn on the cob, a bowl of rice, and occasionally the order of lobster but that's rare because I don't want to spend a fortune every time I'm there $$$. The Hot n Juicy special sauce is by far my favorite, but the cajun is fantastic as well. I usually do one of each. They also have fresh oysters for appetizers, and you can also choose from blue crab, king crab, mussels, and of course, crawfish for your main course ;).   The service is always great because the staff works as a team, so there is almost always somebody to refill your water, grab you more plastic gloves, etc..    **HERE'S AN IMPORTANT TIP!**: you WILL stink of garlic after this meal. Possibly for over a day! The food is worth it, but don't go here before your work shift, the gym, or a night out with friends because nobody will appreciate your stench! A thorough shower afterwards is crucial!  Overall, I love visiting Hot N Juicy for the fun environment, quick and attentive service, the killer spicy cajun flavors, and to get full off of a ton of seafood! As much as I enjoy Boiling Crab, HnJ is still on top mostly because of their sauces. HnJ has more of a kick and intense flavors."}
{"text":"Hawt n' Joosay!  The name really says it all for this place.  The sauce is hot, the food is juicy.  Get a garbage bag of food and tap into your inner caveman.  Most crawfish joints do kind of the same thing but the variations in the sauces make them different.  What sets this place apart is they use the sichuan pepper (i think) which leaves your mouth a little numb but taste great and creates a unique spiciness.  As far as the items to order Ive had most of the menu but here are my suggestions.  King Crab Legs  - Hands down the item to get.  Huge chunks of crab with little effort.  You just have to know how to use the little plastic claw tool.  Use one side to make a crack then the other to slice through like scissors through paper.  Ask your server if you need help.  Don't be afraid of the price these are well worth it, trust me you wont be sorry.    Shrimp - If your not going big with the crab legs then these are the best bang for your buck.  Best meat to price ratio and easy to eat.  Corn - Soaks up the sauce like a sponge.  Make room in your gut for this.  Don't Sleep!   Fries - Regular or Sweet Potato are both tasty and good sharing choices to break up all the buttery spice from the seafood.  Sauce - I prefer the everything mix or whatever they call it here.  I also prefer extra spicy which I wouldn't suggest for most people.  Even spicy has a kick to it.  They can handle large groups and there is a second one down the street if this one is full."}
{"text":"Same greatness as the location down the street but this one is a little roomier.    King Crab Legs, Shrimp, and Corn still the best.    If you got a big group I would probably try this one first."}
{"text":"Was there for my son's birthday. Always get shrimps, sweet potato and white rice. I was gonna give them 5 stars but giving them 4 stars.  Because they didn't have anything for birthday special and we had to wait for sweet potato fries for long time. But overall friendly staff, delicious food and clean restaurant. I like this location better than other two in china town."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE! am a long time customer of Hot & Juicy , but the other locations. This was our first time at this location and our LAST!!! We decided to visit this location because it was the closest and we were starving.  We ordered catfish baskets and corn. The corn wasn't even room temperature so we sent it back.  10minutes went by and they brought me the wrong order, a shrimp basket. I then had to wait 10 minutes for food including hot corn. We got the corn back and the reason we ordered it is because we want more sauce! They put a spoon full of sauce in each container. We complained , nothing was done. Instead we were told to order more food (anything that came in a bag). My friend doesn't order that stuff. We shouldn't have to order more food just to get sauce!! I complained online and the manager offered a free side order of sauce. Wth? No thanks!"}
{"text":"Total fan of this place! The owners are super nice too. Laina came over to make sure we were enjoying everything.  We ordered 2 pounds of shrimp, a pound of crab legs, and later added a pound of crawfish (it's their namesake after all). Like everyone says, the shrimp is where it's at. You let that shrimp swim in their Hot N Juicy special sauce and you're in seafood heaven. Make sure you add some corn to that bag of shrimp. I love corn to begin with, but after it's been soaking in that sauce, it becomes absolutely amazing.  Be ready to get down and dirty with your seafood at this place. Make sure to bring your appetite and leave your best clothes at home."}
{"text":"Same Hot n Juicy goodness. New location. This one has a larger interior and easier parking. It's nice to know there is an alternate spot to get dirty with your shrimps and your crabs and your corns and your crawfishes. OK so I usually stick with shrimp and corn. Specifically, my go-to bag of goodness is one pound of Hot n Juicy medium shrimp with 5 corn. Last night, I decided to switch it up. I ordered a bowl of their Étouffée and forewent the shrimp. However, I did hitchhike 3 pieces of corn in someone else's bag of shrimp. Corn on the cob is just oh so good when it's been swimming with the shrimps. I enjoyed the Étouffée; it came extremely hot and had nice spice to it. It was a nice diversion, but I'm going back to shrimp next time. Coz shrimp in a bag is just my bag baby."}
{"text":"I can't  say enough about a place that you pay to wear a bib?!.. getting down and dirty here is always a pleasure.. I still haven't mastered how to gracefully remove the meat out of any crustean.. but no matter, I leave smelling like Hot n Juicy Everytime. You can't not! I'm a huge fan of the crab legs and medium spice, other wise I can't hang lol. Great place for friends and couples, families everyone Never ever disappointed!"}
{"text":"I was finally able to visit this place after all of my friends have been talking about the location in Vegas. This was my first time and it was pretty good. We ordered a pound of the king crab legs, pound of crawfish and half a pound of shrimp. My bf love the crab and crawfish and the shrimp was cooked to perfection. I got the Hot N Juicy sauce with my shrimp and it was okay, nothing too special but I enjoyed it. We also ordered a side of cajun and sweet potato frieds. OMG, so good! The place was clean and the service was good. It was a little bit of a long wait for the food but I was with family so it didn't matter. They even gave us complimentary calenders for HnJ. Really nice! I will come here again but because I live in Chandler it won't be as often and the parking sucks but that is understandable because it is on Mill Ave."}
{"text":"11/1/12 - 6:30pm - I will admit, I am not a huge fan of Louisiana style seafood. However a large group of us were going out for dinner and this is the place they selected. I am pretty opened minded with food and wanted to give it a good shot.   The place is busy, I definitely recommend planing to arrive with the possibility you will have to wait a minute for a table. My girlfriend and I had a lb of Shrimp mild with the hotnspicy special seasoning and a lb of blue crap with garlic butter. We also ordered the cajun fries and corn fritters.   The shrimp showed up in a bag marinating in the sauce, the crab came shortly after in its own bag with the fries and fritters in tow. It was messy to eat and absolutely delicious!! I would definitely recommend the pace to anyone who wants to go enjoy some delicious seafood with incredible flavor. We had a great time and thoroughly enjoyed the food!!"}
{"text":"I came here with a group of my friends and I loved the concept of the fresh Seafood in a bag.  I was a bit skeptical at first but, after I dug into it I couldnt get enough of it.   My servers name was Rich and his recommendations were awesome.  We were a needy group and he went above and beyond for me and my friends.  The rest of the servers were friendly upon arriving and when I left.  I look forward coming back here soon.  The Lemon Pepper seasoning was by far the best with the Shrimp."}
{"text":"Our first time here the staff was awesome helping us pick the right sauce for us. The kids enjoyed being as messy as they wanted without getting into trouble. Everything we ordered was great.  Don't wear anything nice here as you will get it messy even wearing a bib."}
{"text":"Delicious fish.Crab and Lobster and crawfish rock.The sauce is delicious.the service is awesome and the drinks are great"}
{"text":"At last count there were two Hot N Juicy Crawfish locations in Las Vegas, but I have it on good authority that this is the one you want, at 4810 Spring Mountain Road. My husband and I were steered towards this one, further away though it is, by a reliable local, which is the kind of good advice you want when choosing an off-strip, local neighborhood place. Driving from the strip, you actually have to pass a Hot N Juicy Crawfish (in Chinatown) to get to the \"right\" Hot N Juicy Crawfish.  Located on a busy multi-lane road chock-a-block with shopping centers and fast food, Hot N Juicy Crawfish doesn't look like much from outside. Or inside, for that matter -- a decent-sized space looks smaller than it is because of so many ragtag tables squeezed together, it's usually packed, it's loud, and I wouldn't exactly call it clean. You're in the middle of the desert but the vibe is carefree beachside -- the floor is a mess and most diners are wearing plastic bibs, happily covered in sauce. You order at a counter, from a menu posted on the wall overhead, and they call you when your order is ready.   Though you can get baskets of fried shrimp, crab legs, raw oysters, wings and chicken nuggets, Hot N Juicy Crawfish put their signature item right in their name. When you order the crawfish, there's a method. No \"crawfish Nazis\" here -- the staff will kindly help you out if you're a first-timer. You order your crawfish by the pound, then you pick a seasoning, then you pick a spice level. For seasoning, you pick from Louisiana Style, Cajun, Garlic Butter, Lemon Pepper or a Hot N Juicy Special. Spice levels range from mild to \"holy s@#t.\" That's not what they call it, that's what I called it. If you like spicy, you love this stuff.  The best experience is to go off-hours with a group, get an assortment of seasonings and spice levels, get some cold beers and have a blast. Wear something washable, yer gonna get messy!"}
{"text":"Came here for my cousin's birthday and we had Randy as our server. I arrived first and was immediately greeted at the front. I waited for the rest of my party and was seated as soon as they arrived. Randy was very friendly and patient as we were deciding how to order. We shared mussels, clams, sausages, shrimp, and cajun fries. We got the \"hot n' juicy\", baby-spice sauce and it was delicious. All of the seafood we got were huge. This place is so worth it! Will definitely come back for the amazing servers, food, and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Sad to report that my lunch was a bust. Ordered Shrimp Po Boy, a small potato and a corn. Friend ordered 1/2 pound of shrimp and rice. The Po Boy came out in like ten minutes. I'm not going to sit and eat in front of my friend. 33 minutes and twice to ask the server if the food was coming later, my friends food and my sides arrived. Now the \"hot\" shrimp sandwich is cold. I asked if they could make another one. they took the sandwich and returned with a \"new\" one to go (lunch hour was OVER). I opened the box and saw that the sandwich had been microwaved or stuck under the heater. The lettuce was all cooked. I asked for them to just take it away and that I would return to speak with the Manager when I had a minute. The server stated, \"I don't know WHAT they did to your sandwich\". wow...just wow... So, no lunch. Still hungry. I DID get hit with a $4.15 bill for iced tea and a small corn and potato. LOL. No apology. I manage a huge high rise next door. Sad that I won't return. Even if it's 50 feet away."}
{"text":"First time I tried a place like this. Love it! We had garlic crab, hot/juicy shrimp, lemon crawfish. My favorite was the crawfish even though theres not much meat. Its fun to eat, and damn good."}
{"text":"IF you like FISH BAIT this is your place.  I found several things that were really bad.  1st service is slow 2nd they weigh there crawfish w the sauce in the bag. so you really dont get what u are supposed to get. 3rd. the shrimp are very tough and super dirty 4th the crawfish a very  very dirty 5th what ever spicy level you order they just give you whatever they feel like  6th CASH DISCOUNT? wtf is this. you mean if i decide to pay in cash, you will give me a discount? does this mean you are doing something wrong. Im pretty sure if you stay at bally's and when you check out. The front desk says. hey if you pay with cash i will give u a discount? no way. this is called tax fraud.  Rule# 1 about eating seafood in the nevada. ONLY in a hotel! there stuff is so rubbery and nasty. i really could not eat it. and i eat pretty much everything. but this was the 1 that was impossible.   I dont think any real foody would disagree.  my score: 1-10  staff- 3 menu- 2 price- 2 bathrooms- cant even be rated is was that bad \"0\"  over all- Total Scam!"}
{"text":"Liked it so much...ate there twice during trip to Vegas. Only suggestion is to peridiocally clean the table. My garbage (i.e. straw wrapper, used napkins,) was starting to comingle with my food."}
{"text":"one of my favorite places! I love ordering cajun fries and the sweet potato fries are a good addition too! I believe everyone should try this! ;)"}
{"text":"I love this place, best crab legs, shrimp and Cajun sauce in the city! I go there every time I visit Vegas! :)"}
{"text":"Before this review is set into place, I just want to say that I have previously loved Hot N Juicy, so much that I rave about it to others. Yet, I'm sitting here tonight to complain about their horrible customer service.   When I came here, my name was written down and I was told that it would be half an hour wait. Even after the half an hour mark, I insisted to my BF that sometimes servers are wrong on their wait time. I gave them the benefit of the doubt. The server started to seat people based on the amount of people in the party rather than giving priority to who came first. You might ask how the heck I would know this, and the answer to this question is that a party of 6 who very obviously put their name down after mine were seated first.   Once we were seated, 57 minutes later, we waited another 15 for a server to even ask us what we would like.   Dear Hot N Juicy executives,   We all get busy. I get that. But some employees of yours need to be disciplined on the meaning of customer service. I might have not brought a large party, but that doesn't mean I didn't bring a big appetite.   I hope the next time I come in, this indecency will not be an issue."}
{"text":"We got the Drool which was awesome and a lot of food for two people.  No pictures because we were starving and this place is messy (but fantastically good!)  Service was attentive and very friendly.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"We ordered the shrimp, crawfish & oysters accompanied by corn, potatoes, rice, corn fritters & sweet potato fries!  Everything was hot & delicious!"}
{"text":"Normally this would go without saying, but it happened; sorppt 74 minutes is too long to wait for food once youve ordered. Thats 1 hour and 14 minutes of sitting at a table waiting for a simple order. We came as a party of two; we're regulars so, whenever we come here we order as soon as we sit down because we are familiar with the long wait times. We know what we like and get the same order every time, we love the restaurant and always bring in our family and friends, and this is the first time we have ever come down and had to wait so long for anything.   Our simple order was for 1 lb of Shrimp HnJ Special (Spicy), 1 lb of Shrimp HnJ Special (Mild), and two sides of rice.   After the many times we have come we know that ordering clams / oysters takes about 25 min, ordering wings or fried cod can take from 30min-40min, but cajun/regular fries and shrimp are usually under 20 min. Yes i acknowledge that it was busy, it was the lunch rush when we came, and you did have 2 parties of at least 8 people maybe more, but still 74 minutes is a long time to wait from ORDERING to RECEIVING the food.  After 45 minutes we asked a waitress to check on our order, she left and came back and said, \"Your order is coming, when you got here the kitchen was behind at least 20 orders, ok? so its not as if we forgot about you.\" Heres a tip, customers aren't as interested in hearing an excuse of whats taking so long, as what you are/will be doing to remedy the situation, also note that a simple apology or showing that its unacceptable to wait so long goes a long way. No one was apologetic or sincere until the end of our meal, when someone dropped off the check and said, \"Here you are, and I'm sorry for the wait.\" The end of the meal is too late for the apology, it should happen in real time.  I was here twice last December and completed a survey each time, each visit the store wasnt busy, no wait time on a table and the friendliness was outstanding, straight 5s across the board. I hope your standards arent slipping, and your service isnt failing, i would hate for an tasty restaurant to suffer from bad/neglected service."}
{"text":"Shrimp were yummy.  Fun place for large groups.  My girlfriend enjoyed the crawfish and clams.  She thought the shrimp were the best."}
{"text":"Like most Yelpers, I first heard of Hot 'n Juicy from Man vs. Food but the Yelpers seemed mixed on this one so I kept my expectations low.   Even during midday, the parking lot was practically full. I could smell seafood-y goodness wafting through the door. I was seated quickly near a fuzzy TV & the waitress even moved me to a cooler seat. I was wary about service but was pleasantly surprised by the kind & attentive servers.   My friend & I shared 2lb crawfish & 2 lb shrimp mild (my body won't allow me to consume spicy anymore but mild still had a bit of spice). I'm not a fan of Boiling Crab's the Whole Shebang-- I prefer garlic butter-- so I am in the same camp with other Yelper who felt the hot & spicy sauce could use more garlic. I also felt the food could have come out a little hotter temperature-wise.    Water was free, the wait was nonexistent on a Saturday afternoon, parking was easy, they carried $3 bottled Sapporo (is this because it's near Chinatown?), you could add potato, & both they had multiple restrooms (one of my big qualms).  For me, it comes down to the food. Overall impression: Good, not quite Boiling Crab good."}
{"text":"Tried this place after work for dinner. I've been to a similar place like this called Boiling Crab and I will stick with them next time. The food wasn't terrible but I've had better. However, the service left more to be desired. As this was the first time being here I wanted to try the seasoning prior to ordering. I was told that I couldn't have a sample of the seasoning... it's not like I was asking for a crab leg just the seasoning.... less than a teaspoon. When I was finished I had to request wipes versus them being given considering the waitresses clearly just watched me eat with my hands. The check was brought in the middle of us eating as if to rush us out yet they weren't crowded. The shrimp was ok, wasn't seasoned well to me, corn and crab legs were good. All in all, I don't have to try it again, customer service goes a long way ?."}
{"text":"I was with a party of four and arrived at 8pm. We were told there was a 20 minute wait, which we were OK with. We ended up being seated about 30 minutes after waiting... which again was OK. The service seemed OK for the first 30 minutes but it progressively worsened. We ordered 8 pounds of various things (excited to try everything). About thirty minutes after being seated, we got an order of soft crab and a pound of clams. The clams were delicious! About 20 minutes later, we got 2 pounds of crawfish. Again, the crawfish was delicious. The seasoning they use is amazing! We ordered extra spicy and while it was very spicy, the taste was extremely flavorful and perfect for those who like very spicy food. More than an hour had passed from the moment we were first seated and we had yet to get the rest of the food we had ordered. When we asked about it we were told that there had been a ticket mishap and the rest of our food wasn't being made... this didn't make sense since a couple of the things we had ordered made it to our table. We were told it would be a few minutes. Again, more than 15 minutes passed and by that point we were extremely frustrated and disappointed. The servers seemed disorganized and kept asking what they had already brought and what we were still missing. We ended up canceling the remaining of our order and although the server said she would be speaking to the manager, there was no compensation or apology from the manager. Although the food (that we got to taste) was fantastic, the service was a shame!! The waitresses were nice (but couldn't get the job done). The overall experience was bad. We were there to try various foods and instead left disappointed because they failed to bring out all of the food we ordered within almost a two-hour time frame. To top it off, when the bill came, we were being charged for food that never made it to our table."}
{"text":"This place is, hands down, the best crawfish in the city!! My wife and I got the Get Your Feet Wet with an extra pound of crawfish and extra corn. I do have to say that I received 2 corns that weren't hot all the way through, but our waitress quickly took care of it and ended up crediting us. Overall, the atmosphere is nice and the food is wonderful."}
{"text":"WOW! Took my kids here to Hot N Juicy Crawfish for dinner while in Las Vegas for a wedding. I was excited that it was walking distance from where we were staying. I LOVE, LOVE ME SOME SEAFOOD and they prepared it perfectly with the right amount of yummy seasoning and their kick ass sauce flavors - Oh My! Started our order with juicy Cajun seasoning, medium spice level, 2 lbs shrimp, 1 lb Black mussels, 1 lb of king crab legs, potatoes, rice, corn and sausage. Oh how I wanted to order more, but there wasn't a microwave in our room for any leftovers. Nonetheless, we were stuffed and happy to go walk it off a bit lol. While we were sitting there, letting the food settle, we all had a laugh as we looked around and noticed everyone wearing over gloves to eat as we were looking at our messy, saucy hands waiting to waddle to the hand washing stations. I mean, we're Pacific Islander and we do eat with our hands, so maybe with that observation, we weren't offered those over gloves lol. No worries, didn't need them anyways ha! Thank you Hot N Juicy Crawfish for an amazing dinner! See ya next time :p"}
{"text":"The service sucks today.. This is one of my favorite places and after coming here today I may just find somewhere else to go EVERY SUNDAy...  After sitting here for about an hour I ask about my crab legs. 2 servers say the shrimp (my girlfriend had) has a shorter cook time than crab legs. Why would they start cooking her shrimp at the same time as my crab legs of that is the case? Also that's a lie because a table came in after Us and got their crab.. Smh the manager was notified and this bad manager for the sake of this post tool 2.40 off my bill? I wipe my ass with 2.40 he can keep that and they can find another regular.. I lost me.. Oh yea and I ordered a cat fish basket and I've been waiting 25 minutes.. Lmao this is an abusive relationship if u ask me.. I give u my money and u don't give me good service and expect me to be ok with that. #uncool"}
{"text":"Food has to be checked before consuming!!  Chicken was not cooked, restrooms are filthy, & place is small..."}
{"text":"If you love seafood like me you will get more than one pound of something or one pound of like 2-4 items. If this is true for you just know you will be spending about 40-75 dollars just on your food. I love the fact they give you a few sets of gloves because things can get messy real quick. The entire restaurant works as a team to serve the guest. I would recommend this place while you're in Vegas. This is the freshest seafood you're going to find in Navada!"}
{"text":"HNJ Crawfish is just ok. For some reason my friend got his food right away and I didn't get mine for another 20 minutes by which time he had already finished.   I got the snow crab and it was decent though nothing special imo."}
{"text":"LET ME BE CLEAR WHEN I SAY THAT I NEVER NEVER NEVER WRITE YELP REVIEWS.   I've worked in the f&b industry for 7 years and went to UNLV for hospitality so I don't like yelp. But this just made me angry.  We love hot n juicy. We think it's better than boiling crab to be honest.   We hadn't come in about a year so we decided that we wanted that for lunch. After this experience, I don't want to go back.    My husband, sister and I arrived at 2:20pm today to eat. There were 4 groups ahead of us that hadn't been helped waiting to get on the list. A server finally came over and sat 3 parties.   So now there was a group of 2 people and then us a group of 3.   After 10 mins 2 ladies walked in and they were put on a list. They had 7 people in there group.   A big group left that had occupied 2 tables.   Awesome! We thought we'd be next because the two tables would be easy to separate for the group of 2 in front of us and then our group of 3.   PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE tell me why you sat that group of 7 when not all of their party was there?!   The server said \"we are seating large groups first and then seating the small ones.\"  Why? You had 2 perfectly good tables that you could've separated.    This was at 2:48pm  We decided to let it go until they called for a group of 9 at 2:52pm that had arrived no less then 5 mins ago.   That was the last straw. We walked out and decided to go to BJs where we were sat right away.   Long story short, don't go to hot n Juicy with a small group of people because they won't seat you as soon as they can. Come with groups of 7 or more because they are the priority."}
{"text":"What is this place?! Hot n Juicy...i think not!  Went there with friends for the first time and being this our first meal of the day of the trip....YELPers and Hot n Juicy totally did not deliver...for shame for shame  Lets begin... the service - eh its ok, i had better at like a McDonald's but it wasnt like horrible but eh.... the decor - like again...nothing fancy, ive seen better McDonald's, but it was at least together...like there is a theme but it just isnt my cup of tea.  Onto the food - so their menu isnt BIG but its decent Price was a lil out there but then again...its seafood  I ordered fried calamaris...i know...but i still got something that is seafood and my friends got the shrimp and clawfish sha-bang. I tried a shrimp for myself, and ok the sauce was alright...nothing that i would die for if i dont have anymore but eh..im not going to miss it.  My fried calamaris...where are you, i was waiting!  I was expecting fries to come along with it since it said it would but...with a sad face...i didnt get it =(.  My calamaris? how are they you ask? umm...tasteless? is that too harsh, ok...it was very blah and not seasoned and the portion size...it is probably the size of my fists and then some.  Yea not much for 9 bucks...  so my friend's meal...NOT SO PRETTY....the crawfish was big but not fresh...it was black...and i know a thing about seafood or so...and it shouldnt have looked like the way it did....soooo  to just finish the whole thing...it wasnt good, it was a waste of my money and everyone else's....and never again... will i go back"}
{"text":"I love Hot N Juicy. This was my first time at the Vegas location and we were satisfied. The staff was polite and the restaurant was clean. They were pretty packed, but we only waited maybe 10 minutes for a table...not bad at all.  We ordered crab legs, shrimp, andouille sausage, and corn with the medium sauce. The food was so good and their sauces are still delish! The food is delivered hot, which is always a plus. The downfall with Hot N Juicy opposed to other seafood boil places is they do not give you all the food in one bag. The shrimp came out first, then like 5-10 minutes later the crab legs, sausage, and corn came out. A lot of people, like myself, like to have everything together. It's a minor thing, but it does drive me a little nuts. Lol. One other thing I didn't like is they make you order 6 or 12 sausage pieces, while other places allow you to order however many you'd like.   Overall, the food and service were good. I'd go back to this location whenever I return to Vegas."}
{"text":"I hate to give this place 2 stars because of a server's fault. The last time I was there, our server placed the wrong order for our table.  I ordered two different flavors of shrimp with one pound each. But the server somehow only heard one flavor. Everyone else in my table heard that I ordered two flavors.   It's fine when someone makes a mistake. It could happen to anyone. But, he insisted that he was not wrong. Instead of apologizing, he actually offered me to order another pound of shrimp of the flavor I want. Really?? Is he trying to upsell me another pound of shrimp in this situation? Or is he just too afraid to admit that he had made a mistake. Maybe he afraid that his manager will say something to him.    Maybe it was my fault that I didn't say it clear enough. Or maybe he is just not taking our orders seriously. Regardless of who is wrong or right, he shouldn't act so unprofessional. I was not that mad until how he handled this situation.   Luckily all other servers were really nice. Food was good as usual."}
{"text":"I got the Hot N Spicy snow crab legs and they were fantastic!! My second time here, my first time was just yesterday! It was so good that I had to come back! I'm from Pittsburgh on vacation and will def recommend this spot to anyone!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed myself when I ate here the other evening. I saw this restaurant on an episode of \"Man VS Food,\" so naturally I had to eat here on my trip to Las Vegas. We ordered a pound of \"crawfish\" with 'Hot & Juicy Sauce (mild)' & a pound of \"shrimp\" with 'garlic/butter (mild)' sauce. They both were amazing and the fact that you eat with plastic gloves (optional) is super fun. Be prepared to smell like seafood for a while and do not wear white. Shper fun & a must do while in Las Vegas.     P.S. Order a side of sweet potato fries. Yum!"}
{"text":"Puts many of the \"other\" similarly styled and structured restaurants to shame. Food was fresh and delicious.   If the waitress was more attentive and followed instruction better, it'd be a 5-star review."}
{"text":"The worst meal I've ever eaten in Las Vegas. Service was terrible. Brought out one meal then the other persons meal 30 minutes later. Definitely more work than it is worth. Save your money and time"}
{"text":"I take back my review from last time. Flavor is there but tonight we all got some super over cooked shrimps. I was literally choking on some shells & the server wasn't even apologetic. No solutions were offered what so ever. Never coming back here again. Disappointed!"}
{"text":"We used to love coming to this place. Their food is super yummy! BUT eating out at a restaurant is partly so we can be served rather than serving ourselves at home. Today, the only time we saw our server was when she took our order and delivered it. My boyfriends water cup was empty from halfway through the meal til we left.. we never saw her and wasn't even there to deliver our check. We had to ask one of the other servers ourselves! What made it worse was that the server checked on the tables around us but our table!  Not coming back to this place again :( I would rather go to the original location or boiling crab"}
{"text":"Another successful delish meal at Hot N Juicy. Every single time I am in Vegas we religiously come eat here. We get the pounds of Shrimp, sweet potato ff and some chilled beers. The food is consitently excellent. The service is friendly and patient. The dining room is inviting, clean and nicely decorated. The have elevated booths along the wall giving it a bar feel. The music they play is good and they also have a lot of Flat Screen TV.s I LOVE me some Hot N Juicy!!!"}
{"text":"Marx was terrific! So 5 star for service dude! Flavors were great, and lots of spice. Overall a little too salty for my taste, crawfish is a do it once kind of thing but the shrimp, crab, and corn fritters were awesome! Cool spot, and lots of people having fun. Be ready to eat out of bags and get dirty! Fun and yum!"}
{"text":"This place isn't really anything spectacular. My wife and I went there last night and the up sell like a beast. When we walked in, the smell was disgusting. It smelled like flammable methane fart gas. Lol has to be from the spices they use. We got to the table, it took a while for the server to get there. Once there, they got our drink order and then food order as usual. Then the server changed. We still got everything we ordered, but with the change there was a little confusion.   When the food arrived, it was hot...but not juicy! It was in an inch or two of hot sauce, and you had to dredge the sauce just to find the shrimp. The seasoning they use is just too much. It's actually overkill.   I don't plan in going back. I was hoping for some solid Cajun food and got slop.  Totally not impressed!"}
{"text":"I am not a sea food fan, but this place im willing to sit down and grub.  I went in, ordered 1 pound of crawfish, and 1 pound of shrimp, with there special blend of seasoning, its all the seasoning mixed together (suprisingly very good) and we choose the spicy, as in mild , hot, spicy , or extreme.  sit down at this table, no forks, spoon, there is a thing you tie around your neck to keep your shirt clean. its pretty funny never been to a place like this.  They serve you the food, in plastic bags, to keep the moisture and flavor locked in, and you just dump it out on the table.  I loved the Shrimp, not a very big fan of crawfish.  for a seafood joint, i liked it.  very cheap too, whole meal 3 ppl 35 bucks."}
{"text":"A lover of crawfish and all there is seafood - this is the place to go. Their seasoning is excellent. It may be pricy but totally worth it. The servers are very friendly and are always willing to answer any questions."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh. After today's visit, I finally understand the hype around HNJ! This place is GOOD. The only thing that sucks is the wait! So it's a good thing it's worth it!  We had a few people visiting from Texas, so my best friend Randy and I had to be strategic about getting a party of 10 people in this small space. Since they don't take reservations, I planned to put our name down early and wait before everyone else got there. The wait was at least 30 minutes when we got there. By the time everyone showed up, it had been 40 minutes, however, the hostess came out to inform us that they were preparing our table! Wonderful timing and within another five minutes, we had a table in the middle of the restaurant.  The food was delicious and with a large group, the experience was so much fun! I don't normally like getting dirty or using my hands, but with the bibbs, plastic gloves, cracker, sheller, and paper towels, it made dinner very enjoyable. I ordered a pound of the KING CRAB LEGS (market price today was $25.99/lb) with the Hot N Juicy Special (all the seasonings combined) in Medium. Oh, it was so tasty and those legs were huge! It was challenging with thin plastic gloves and legs with gigantic spikes, so I utilized three pairs of gloves and several paper towels. I think there needs to be gardening gloves and/or real towels for those heavy duty crab legs! It can be pretty dangerous. Ruben and I also ordered the calamari and Cajun fries. All delicious! But that Hot N Juicy Special seasoning/sauce, WOW.  Wonderful, wonderful place. The service was just okay, but I know they're busy and honestly, you're so consumed with wrestling crab legs that you forget your server hasn't checked on you. As long as they remember to keep the beverages filled, there's nothing lacking. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Spicy Spicy Spicy. You will be full when you leave this place. I will be adding more, but I gotta do a few more things on the menu. So far, everything was Good..... On warning though. Get there early before 6pm. If not you will spend some time looking for a parking spot, then you will stand outside for a while, waiting for a table to clear up. Another good thing, they don't rush you out of the place when you finish eating, you get a few to let your food settle before you hit the road.."}
{"text":"Come here for the experience- it's messy but  fun!  The service was good & the menu was well explained, we split The Drool (more than enough for two).  The craw-fish, shrimp, crab & calamari was all great however this place runs SPICEY;  we did the Hot & Juicy flavor/mild spice, my lips were on fire!  You get a bib,  gloves, napkins, & get to make a huge mess on the plastic table cloth.   I wasn't in love with it all but that's because it's simply not my type of thing (messy) BUT I'm glad we went & I'd totally go back with someone who I know would be into it."}
{"text":"Damn! where do I begin?! I couldn't decide over the steamed shrimp or the Snow Crab clusters. I ended up going with the Crabs. I'm East Coast and you need to steam and smother shrimp in Old Bay. I didn't smell old bay when I walked in, so I was sure they don't use it. So I opted for the Crab. I got it Cajun - Spicy. They will talk you out of spicy, but if you can eat a Jalapeno then you will be fine.  Food comes out in a bucket, and a steam bag. I dug in, and the crab tasted delicious. What I didn't know and what set this dinner into orbit was take a hunk of meat and slam it into the bottom of the steam bag where the juices are....FLAVOR BOMB!!.  I quickly poured out the butter dish, and poured in the juice from the bag. Corn was over boiled, but I don't eat corn, just sampled some from my awesome girl friends plate. Bread was good, sampled that too! I'm not a carb eater, so don't take my word for it. Everything had flavor and it was awesome.   I'm coming back for Bike Night, and will get 2 pounds steamed shrimp, and I'll bring my own Old Bay.  Good job Hot n Juicy."}
{"text":"Ok I'm hooked. Their entire menu is as good as it gets and service is excellent. I try to go about once a week. The only negative would be that the older location really needs a remodel. The food and service is as good but just feels dirty."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time. The wait is not bad. Ordered the set shrimp,crawfish,corn, sausage. Mild hot and juicy style. The shrimp was good and large, the sauce was good. Also, ordered oysters,this is where the 2 stars come off. They tasted watery not briny, and seems frozen. Not sure what happened. Service was good"}
{"text":"horrible guest service...  no tools to eat my crab with, was told we will get more crackers after it was washed, but never heard back, no water refills while other bigger tables gets refills constantly.  items missing from order.  i love the food but i will never visit this location again.  just a horrible experience."}
{"text":"I like the place but since it's still new the service still needs work.  Always ordering at least 2 lb crawfish and mussel (green) fries are always good.  I tried the etoufee was cold.  So that wasn't good.. But slightly satisfying the cravings"}
{"text":"Been coming here since the location opened.. I've never been disappointed food is always excellent!  Haven't been here on a weekday for a long time ..it's around 6:30 p.m. in the place is pretty empty.  The food always comes really fast.. With the exception of the fried shrimp it usually takes about 10 to 15 minutes longer and everybody else's meal that's with us but that just gives you time to snack nother food !"}
{"text":"Don't be afraid where this store is located. I have never eaten crawfish, but have eaten many blue claw crabs.  Step outside your comfort zone,  put on a bib and experience the juicy crawfish."}
{"text":"So dissatisfied....  I go alot to hot and juicy in West Hollywood CA I always get the drool which is about $50 in West Hollywood... Here I paid $52 +tax and it was the size of a get your feet wet... Had no flavor and I was told by the hostess it was FROZEN not fresh shrimp, crab and crawfish... The corn was also frozen had that chewy stick to your teeth texture.  Frozen crab was so salty i had to drench it lemon to even it out.   Totally left feeling unsatisfied..."}
{"text":"The 5 stars are for my husband. I would give it 4 for lack of options for non seafood eaters. He wanted to go for his birthday and was in seafood heaven. He was very happy with this pick and can't wait to return. Service was good. They let me serve his birthday cake (although they weren't equip to serve it, so bring your own serving utensils). We were easily accommodated for a group of 8. Chicken wings were greasy, but Cajun fries were good. Everyone who ordered food from the sea slurped and cracked and was silent with enjoyment most of the meal. If you like that sort of thing, this place is for you."}
{"text":"The best!!!! I'm obsessed. Get the shrimp with some sausages in it. And a side of rice to eat with the sauce in the bag. It is the best thing ever. Seafood that's perfectly seasoned. Love it. Ate everything till we couldn't move anymore."}
{"text":"My review is SUPER late ! Please excuse my lateness ! Lol .   Came in on Sunday March 1st 2015 , had a few friends waiting for us , which brought us to a group of 4 !   This was actually my first time here , I never liked this place cause I thought it was just crawfish , and I don't like crawfish AT ALL!! Until my Best friends said \"It's not only craw fish, they have shrimp and other stuff.\" And when I heard shrimp I was like \"YUM-O.\"   So we ordered a bunch of things and of course I got a pound of shrimp in some sauce , I don't know what kind of sauce it was BUT dear lord , it was BOMB , I topped that sauce off on my rice and at it , the BEST I had so far ! Anyways , I walked in and smelled this wiff of shrimp smell , I was like oh my !! Smells so good , and made me even MORE hungry ! For a first timer , I REALLY REALLY LOOOOOVE the shrimp there .   Our service was great ! Other employees came to check on us to see if we were ok , everything was fine , our order came out good , everything was fine . The only thing I dislike is that this place is dark , im not blind lol but I don't like eating in dark , spice that light up a little , the music was on point , of course I danced , lol . I blame the shrimp! Aha .   I recommend anybody who loves shrimp to go here , because it's the best shrimp by far !   The other thing I dislike about it and it has nothing to do with the place , you actually leave with the smell as well lol and I pumped my perfume so much times that the smell of it wont go any where im like \"Omg I still can smell it.\" But then again who knows , maybe it's telling me to go back lol .   I will definitely be back for more shrimp , maybe MORE then a pound this time. Lol  Thank you Hot n' Juicy for your great hospitality! I'm very appreciated !"}
{"text":"good heavens...   we had a pound of crawfish, a pound of shrimp, and a pound of snow crab legs... everything was amazing... we had the Hot N Juicy sauce, medium spicy... it was unbelievable...  i've been to boiling crab (which i love) and other similar type places... and hands down, hot n' juicy is the best.  ALWAYS a must for me whenever i'm in sin city."}
{"text":"I had to eat at the hot and juicy on spring mountain for quite a while because I loved the corn fritters and the crab legs but the other location made your fingers smell like garlic so I opted to go for just steamed crab legs I absolutely love the corn fritters and I was so happy when they opened the location in Greenvalley  I think I was going about once every two weeks and started to bring friends and family everybody likes this place and it's centrally located now with this new were restaurant definitely order those corn fritters I've had corn fritters at other places in there simply nothing like the ones here"}
{"text":"I went here Friday with a group of friends. I ordered the Garlic Crab Legs. Yes the food is absolutely delicious, the service is wonderful, the atmosphere is pretty kool, and there was parking.  I left with a great feeling! Now... its MONDAY... my fingers STILL wreak of the most nastiest stench of my life! I cant get rid of it no matter what I do.  Use Gloves, they dont give you forks so you gotta eat with your fingers like a damn Mongolian from the 18th century. The dog wont go near me, Everytime I smell my fingers I want to barf. Definitely try this place, good for a once in a lifetime thing bring latex gloves and a gas mask!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at this place several times I am not really into crawfish very much but I think that those corn fritters are to die for I've had corn fritters and other places but at this particular restaurant they are a must and probably the best corn fritters of ever had in my whole life  I normally order the mildest form of crab legs since they do not offer any type of lobster but my only real complaint is that the first time that I ever ate there my fingers mainly the tips My fingers reeked of garlic for literally five days You must wear gloves they provide you but if you are a real trooper bring your own sterile rubber gloves and put their gloves over it just trust me on this one there's nothing more annoying than having fingers that smell like garlic and fish Especially when you are a girl Catch my drift"}
{"text":"Yesterday was my first experience with Hot 'n' Juicy, and I was not disappointed one bit! I got some crawfish, calamari, cajun fries, and sausage as take out, and had a VERY hard time keeping some for my boyfriend when he got home from work! It was absolutely delicious food! My only complaint was that even the \"medium\" level was still so spicy! But anyway, fairly priced menu items, in my opinion. Good-sized portions. Very friendly staff members. I will definitely be going back again. :)"}
{"text":"Crab legs, little spice, hot N juicy seasoning - best combination on earth. This is definitely the place you want to take visitors or any seafood lovers."}
{"text":"We ate here for dinner tonight and yes, I am officially a fan!  We always drive by this place and the parking lot is always packed.  I've also been hearing about it a lot.  It was also featured on man vs. food.  Didn't need any more reasons to stop by here.  So we decided on dinner here tonight.  We got here at 9 on a tuesday night, mind you, and the parking lot was packed as usual.  We were lucky enough to get a parking spot and unfortunately there was a 30 min. wait for the 4 of us.  I don't mind waiting for food as long as it's good food!   We actually ran across the street to the crown and anchor to grab a beer while we waited.  The bartender there told us that that was pretty common.    So we get seated 30 min later and we're ready!  We started with 2 lbs of crawfish, 2 lbs of shrimp, 2 lbs of king crab legs all wth the hot n juicy marinade, spicy.  We also ordered fried shrimp sweet potato fries, corn and potatoes and a round of beers.   The tables are lined with a garbage bag and there is a roll of paper towels for each table.  No silverware.  The food started coming out really fast, within 5 minutes of ordering.  They are deiivered in plastic bags.  Oh man, the crawfish was delicious! Hot and juicy of course and the seasoning was so spicy and addictive.  My mouth was on fire inside and out!  But i couldnt stop!  Everything was really good.  Spicy, buttery and garlicy....Yum!  We ended up ordering 2 more lbs of crawfish, 1 more lb of crab legs and some more corn.  oh man, the corn was to die for.  Sweet, but so spicy.   A very messy meal and you kinda have to work for your food but it was definitely worth it!  The prices were reasonable as well.  I will definitely go back here."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night, the restaurant was packed but there were seats outdoors so we sat outside. The location of the restaurant is perfect and the service was great, the staff were super friendly! The food was absolutely amazing, hands down the best seafood I've ever had! The Hot n juicy special and Juicy Cajun are my absolute favourite seasonings, I get both every time I come here. Remember to get corn with it!"}
{"text":"I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!!!! It never fails every time i visit this place i always get the best waitresses !! Great vibe & nice area to check out."}
{"text":"Really delicious. The hot and juicy sauces are awesome. Great service. Our drinks never went empty. Aubrey our server was on too of it."}
{"text":"Hot N Juicy is one of those places that I never thought I would like.  Growing up, my relatives have always been obsessed with crab legs and other seafoods that you have to work for to get to the good stuff.  As I got older I saw that it wasn't just my family, it was pretty much everybody that was obsessed with peeling their food.  I just did not see the point in having to work so hard for your food!  And then there was Hot N Juicy.  Admittedly, my first visit here was made reluctantly.  If I didn't care much for crab, why would I care for crawfish?  The answer is easy: the Hot N Juicy Special sauce.  Medium spice.  I went from avoiding seafood that requires my hands to eat, to getting serious cravings for Hot N Juicy.  That sauce is spicy and leaves a (pleasant) burn on your lips as you continue to eat.  The garlic flavor can get pretty strong as it leaves it's mark on your breathe, and infiltrates every article of clothing you're currently wearing.  You'll probably end up doing laundry as soon as possible.  But all of that doesn't matter...because the sauce is worth it.  My current favorite is the shrimp.  Crawfish is good, but their size is inconsistent.  Not that that's the restaurants fault or anything, it's just that the first time I went, the crawfish were pretty darn big.  But with each subsequent visit...their size diminished.  But it's okay, I have my shrimp to keep me satisfied.  Next time I go I'll have to try the crab.  So has my mind changed about seafood?  No not really.  As it stands, I'm really in it for the sauce.  No Hot N Juicy special, no seafood peeling/cracking for me.  Five stars for instilling a craving that I never thought I would have, and having consistently delicious sauce."}
{"text":"Best seafood experience my family and I have had! Camila our server was on point and the food was delicious.i highly recommend this place.we will definitely be returning here when we want some crawfish and shrimp!!!thanks a bunch guys keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Totally worth having your fingers smelling like shellfish for the next 24 hours it is amazing and  So flavorful. We got crab clams muscles and of course crawfish we didn't go with the spiciest one just the traditional hot and juicy baby spice and it still had a kick to it!  Would definitely recommend this to anybody who is craving some seafood!"}
{"text":"Let's just say the so call manager working tonight should lose his title...I ordered crab,corn etc. The sauce, no matter how baby spice I get it is still too spicy for me so I told the waitress to bring my sauce on the side, thinking that the SAME sauce that would normally go IN the bag, I  wanted to add my own amount.  On my bill were 2 charges for EXTRA sauce, $3.50 total. I explained I didn't receive any additional sauce so remove the charge. This so-call manager said he would go speak to the server to find out first what took place. The manager came back and said he would not remove the charge because I got extra sauce. We went back n forth. I explained the waitress never said \" well if I have them separate the sauce there will be an extra charge.\" She even came over n explained the whole extra charge concept AFTER the fact BUT never said any this in the beginning or I would've said at that time the same thing I'm saying right now, \"that is stupid to do to your customers\" Long story short he would not remove this $3.50. It's the principle folks! I left the exact total amount of the bill, and my friend removed her tip that she had already had on the table. All of the servers were great!  The waitress lost a total of $16 in tip money between the 2 of us due to her brilliant manager over $3.50."}
{"text":"I used to give this place 5 stars but the shrimp is not as good as it used to be. Sometimes the shrimp barely has the sauce and spice in it because it was not cooked in it long enough. The shrimp may not be plump anymore but mushy, mushy as in maybe not fresh but aging quite a bit? At any rate, I no longer crave their shrimps after coming here for years. May have to even eat the ones at Boiling Crab. It seems once they expanded to 3 locations they just started sucking. Service is still good but the shrimp is no longer special. Even the secret sauce is. It that great anymore. Where's that strong garlic taste from when you order garlic spice???"}
{"text":"I honestly do not get it. This place is seriously over rated and over priced. As someone who has lived in Louisiana and had hundreds of crawfish boils, this place is a joke. I doubt very much that they use live crawfish. My son had just one pound at $10.99. He got a bad stomach ache shortly after. He said that the frozen crawfish we buy (in a pinch) at the restaurant depot were much better."}
{"text":"I love this place!! My first time here I believe my server was Tad,  he was so helpful and didn't have a problem answering any of my questions. The food was delicious and the atmosphere made me feel right at home. Definitely recommend Hot N Juicy for anyone who is looking for good food in Mill"}
{"text":"I had hair in my fries the waitress said it was from the shrimp when it wasn't. She gets me a different basket of fries and there was another hair net then she got me another. I still has to pay for my fries in the end smh and it was poor service."}
{"text":"Service was slow and disorganized. Part of our order came back so late it had to be taken home. No offer of a discount. No explanation. Heard several other messed up orders to other customers. My daughter's chicken nuggets (and adult dish) appeared of very poor quality. Sweet potato fries were good. Took far too long to get out the door. Yelp reviews don't lie.  Don't be fooled by the location. This is a sub-par operation.  UPDATE - I did receive a response that was generically apologetic and offered me some free fountain drinks if we came back. Thanks, but I think we'll just steer clear."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner tonight on a whim since the last time that I visited was 2 years ago and we were both less than enthused about our meal. The nice waitress did warn us that the crawfish were frozen since they weren't in season but I'm thinking the shrimp may have been as well since a lot of pieces were mushy inside the bag. The sauce was great that came in the bag but the random mushy pieces of crawfish and shrimp threw us off. I think we'll hunt for a place that does a crab boil with the sauce on the side since businesses that drench their seafood in tons of sauce can hide inferior quality much easier. Something at this restaurant definitely changed and the quality has gone down..maybe they're trying to cut corners to save money.   My boyfriend and I were both sick 20 min after eating here so it could have been the seafood hence all the mushy pieces in our bag.   Nevertheless we won't be back. :("}
{"text":"Are all the new Louisiana style shrimp/crawfish places the same? HELL NO!!!  A few differences from the research (now that translates to food eating) I have done  1) some places charge $.25 a glass for water 2) some locations have buy one beer, get the other free (that rocks!) 3) some places offer disposable gloves for your messy shelling fest 4) some places offer 3% discount off your bill if you pay in cash 5) all places have a signature mix, but don't be fooled...The tastes aren't duplicated! 6) One place is on the Man Vs. Food tour  Hmmm, wonder which place that is....Hot N Juicy offers selections 3-6 of the above list!  The shrimp are plump and yes, JUICY. The corn is sweet and succulent.  Come early to avoid long lines.  We got there around 5:30 pm and were seated right away  Service is attentive and swift.  Parking was kinda hard when we got there, so I can imagine it must be a madhouse when the place gets packed"}
{"text":"Tuy is so sweet and always so friendly! She gives the best customer service and made my bambuu experience enjoyable! I come in just to order my drink! What a class act! My drink is delicious and the service is always pleasant!"}
{"text":"Love! My go to spot for flavorful seafood! They keep the menu simple to the point and service is always great! I will always recommend this place to friends and family that comes into town."}
{"text":"So we came to this restaurant and the wait time was very short as soon as we sat down Jordan our server came up to us and asked us what we wanted to drink, the drinks came out really quick, 5 minutes later she took our order our food was out pretty soon as well . We had a party of four and we ordered over $100 worth of food , some of the orders that we gave Jordan were a little bit complicated but when she brought the food to our table everything was 100% correct ,  I can't say enough and get enough of this restaurant I recommend this to anybody who wants to eat something buttery and spicy and that loves seafood , 100% I recommend this"}
{"text":"I scheduled a ladies night with 5 of my friends on Saturday July 15th. 3 of my friends rcvd there food, me n my other two friends rcvd out apps n French fries only. 30min later our crab comes out. We had asked for a manager 10min earlier but they never came. Turns out the person serving our crab was the GM. She came to the table with an attitude.  I asked her to come on my side of the table so that I can voice my concerns. She insisted on yelling across the table where other patrons started to turn there heads n look at her rude behavior. The male manager came since she had lost her cool. He wrote down our grievances n gave us a contact higher up then this female GM. I lost my appetite at this point. I requested my bill 3x because I was ready to go. Items that were ordered was not taken off the bill, the 20% that was said was going to b deducted had not been deducted, I walked up to the podium where the Mgr n GM was n the female GM gave me more attitude, I told her to have the higher up contact me in regards to this n 20% was sufficient for the horrible dining experience n treatment by her, I have her my business card and left.  Hnj has lost 6 customers due to the GM not having any etiquette. Eduardo n our server was great. I will be reaching out to the higher up tomorrow. If the owner reads this please contact me."}
{"text":"Had the \"Mild\" Hot and Juicy seasoned crawfish.  $1 beer since Mardi Gras.  Came out to just over $15 for lunch.  Whatever you get, be sure to dip the meat back into the sauce.  It makes a huge difference.  A lot of people frequent this location.  Inside is much nicer than outside of building.  Restrooms pretty clean."}
{"text":"I am so disappointed in this place that I had to write this review before I even left.  If there was an option for 0 stars that would be my choice. I used to come here pretty frequently and after tonight's experience I will be taking my business elsewhere. Not only was the food bad but the service and attitude of the manager horrible. We had ordered crawfish, shrimp, and mozzarella sticks to start. The mozzarella sticks were at best room temperature, felt like it was just left out sitting under a warmer until someone ordered it. The shrimp and crawfish were beyond overcooked, the seafood was not fresh, the texture was mushy. The food was flavorless and dry. There was no sauce and as soon as we had mentioned it to a gentlemen walking around he gave us attitude an wouldn't even allow us to finish our sentence. He then left to speak with his manager and returned with a very bad attitude and said \"proportions changed, we will allow to give you some additional sauce this time only.\" He returned to get more sauce/seasoning and never once asked again how things were. Very disappointing for a place I used to enjoy coming to very frequently."}
{"text":"Four stars for taste.  Love the corns! Do get corns!  Besides their shrimp & crawfish, try their wings and french fries. Not sure what it is but it's good!  One star for service. Blah-"}
{"text":"What a concept! Put a bunch of food in a plastic bag, dress adults in bibs and gloves and let them have at it!!! I ordered the snow crab  and corn fritters, my friend ordered king crab and mussels. The menu is ala carte - you order an entree and choose which level of seasoning you desire. If you want to add bread, rice, or many others, have at it!  Your server will make sure your table is covered in plastic and when she presents you with your seafood, you can literally just dump it on the table and dig in! My snow crab was delicious, though you have to work for it by cracking the shells yourself. My corn fritters were not as great - kind of greasy and too bready, but that's not the main attraction.. There's a full bar to order cocktails should you desire to do so.. I opted for water as I was nursing a hangover, lol! The service was excellent and I can't wait to go again. Garlic butter sauce, yes please!!"}
{"text":"I don't see what the big deal is about this place.  Yes, the corn is overcooked and not plump.  Yes, the sauce does taste watered-down.  Just a fun thing to do when in Vegas, I suppose.  I do think the fried catfish was tasty, though.  Ordered: 1 lb frozen craw fish (not in season anyway so who cares), 1 lb shrimp, catfish basket, and 2 corn."}
{"text":"Omigoodness! My friend and I held our own competition between HnJ and BC. I read reviews of both places and after much research, careful review and taste, Hot n Juicy takes the cake...hands down!  The service here is awesome! I came in and put my name in to be seated. The lady told me how long the wait was, which was not that long, and I sat down and observed the others delve into their bags. Then when the time came for my friend and I to be seated, our waitress was right there ready to take our order. I asked some questions and she had answers to all of them. She was super nice and told me her honest opinion of some of the food. I decided to get what I got at BC to make a fair decision, so I ordered two pounds of the snow crab legs. One lb in medium and 1 lb in mild. My friend ordered 2 lb of crawfish in medium as well. And off she went to put our order.   From the tome we put or order in, to the time our food was in front of me was probably around ten min. At BC it was linger and I had to check to make sure my order was still on the way. My friends food came out first. Luckily, she waited for mine to come out and then we began stuffing our faces. Holy goodness and juiciness! At BC, I had to fight to get to the meat and it wasn't as sweet or juicy, but not here. The crab legs were tender, sweet, juicy and hot! I had to slow myself down and savor the moment. I didn't want it to end. I also ordered corn, which was marinating in the sauce. So tasty!  The corn itself was boiled to perfection, then sitting in the sauce was even better! Medium is hot if you dip the meat in it like I did. The waterworks began because it was a bit hot, but good. I dipped the legs in the medium then mild after a few. I ate some of the crawfish too and that was really juicy as well. Some of them were a bit small, but still yummy. Our lady checked in with us a few times and each time I had no words, but nods because I was so into my food, and my mouth was full. I was already eating with my hands, to speak with food in my mouth would be throwing manners completely out the window.  By the end of our meal, I was ready to pass out. All worth smelling like garlic for the rest of the night and into the next day.   The place has an open layout. They have booths, tables and chairs. Flat screen tv's hang on the walls and they also play music. The noise level is pretty high, but that's to be expected.   I will be back here! Some may not like it because you eat with your hands and all the sauce and juice is just popping and flying. But they do offer gloves and a bib. So not to worry. This type of stuff you miss when you're not there. How can you beat the service, juicy food and hip atmosphere? Well, you don't."}
{"text":"First time here and definitely will NOT be the last! Hot N Juicy Crawfish is located in the same plaza as the BJs on the strip of Eastern and is not difficult to find. Parking lot is shared with the whole plaza but I have not had a hard time finding a space yet.    Came here on a Friday afternoon around 5 PM and was seated at a booth as soon as we came in. There were already bibs, napkins, and menus at the table which was great. We were also offered gloves when our server came by. I've been to a restaurant similar to this and I was excited to see how amazing it was going to be based off of all the pictures and reviews.  They have a menu which lists their items and then a separate menu that has how much each item would be for half a pound or a full pound. I got a pound of the shrimp in their signature \"hot n spicy\" sauce in mild which was a combination of all three sauces - can't remember what they were all called though but it was mouth watering. Also ordered their Cajun fries which were seasoned to perfection!   Customer service was excellent - multiple employees came to check up on us and were always refilling our waters and our sweet teas. Can't wait to be back!"}
{"text":"This place is finger lickin' good.  I've been dying to go to this place ever since the review at Las Vegas Weekly http://www.lasvegasweekly.com/news/2008/jul/10/succulent-carnage/ The picture was too enticing to bear so I drove down to Chinatown and took some takeout.  The pound of crawfish and fried soft shell crab smelt incredibly good on the way home.   Firstly, this was the first time I've eaten crawfish so seeing the little buggers sort of eeked me out.  Twisting the head, pulling the first part of the shell and then pinching the tail as stated in the article was tricky at first.  Thats a lot of work for a small piece of succulent meat.  The all in one sauce has that spicy touch and is delicious.  Will definately go back there again."}
{"text":"I can't say enough of how embarrassed we were that we recommended this place to our friends. This was NOT our first visit! If it had been, it'd have been our last.  We and another couple went on Tuesday evening, 6pm....  The wait staff consisted of 4 people (from what we could tell) INCLUDING a trainee. Initial conversation with a seasoned waiter included informing us that he was glad it was a quiet night because he was training a new waiter. Lo & Behold just before our transition to another table, the trainee, by himself, came to take our order. No one to supervise the process, but maybe he'd been at this a few days and could handle it?? Yeah ... No. We asked if the oysters were fresh or previously frozen. His reply with a scrunched up nose was that they were most likely fresh (he couldn't imagine they weren't) but that he'd confirm. (I think he equated FRESH to simply mean not spoiled) His reply to what he would recommend .... He didn't know really because he wasn't familiar with the menu, he was training tonight. (Ut-Oh, this started to have all the signs of ... Hey, wanna try the place down the street?) But we had mercy, & didn't show fear. Everyone has a first day. We persisted! We ordered our Beverages, & Appetizers - Pork Rinds, Raw Oysters - SPECIFYING ONLY if fresh NOT frozen, which he acknowledged, assuring us he'd check & let us know. The rest of the meal was ordered to be brought AFTER the appetizers; Blue Claws & Shrimp, NO spice at all, just Butter & Garlic. Black Mussels, as hot as they come, and spicy Green Mussels. The wait time was ridiculous, there were maybe 4 more tables seated by now. Our Oyster Appetizer - if deemed fresh, had yet to be brought out, nor had the Pork Rinds. Finally someone brought over 2 bags of hot mussels. (which was half of the MAIN meal) We inquired about the Oysters again. Were they fresh or frozen? Were they coming out at all? He said he'd check. Were the Pork Rinds ready yet??? Again that was met with an odd facial expression (think puppy tilting head \"DOH\") and the promise to get them right out. It made little sense for the guest who ordered the raw oysters to eat the HOT & SPICY mussels first because if the oysters WERE fresh & indeed going to be coming out soon, she'd never be able to taste them after eating a pound of hellfire mussels. Understandable. The waiter agreed & stated he would be back with the fresh or frozen mystery solved ... OR better yet, the Oysters themselves might make an appearance, and he would check on the Pork Rinds, AGAIN. 15 minutes go by and just as I was walking over to a staff member to inquire about our order, a server enters the dining room with what he professed to be the NO heat, Garlic/Butter Crab & Shrimp. EXCEPT ~~ they WEREN'T. Instead spicy red sauce was bathing both. Ever the optimist, I decided to try a shrimp, not believing they could be THIS remiss! Alas ... I was wrong. Red Sauce = Spicy. We were subsequently informed that this WAS their house MILD sauce. That'd be OK, IF we ordered mild -- BUT we didn't. We ordered NONE. ZILCH. NO HEAT. JUST FRESH Chopped GARLIC & BUTTER. The Mgr himself couldn't explain the mix ups or the missing Pork Rinds, nor the raw/fresh dilemma. Another server introduced herself. She stated she took over our table since, as she explained, the first waiter was training & the place was getting busier so they traded tables. (Not sure what traded tables meant in that case but we were hopeful) She then explained what she believed to be OUR confusion -- mild vs NONE, and took them back. But not before we asked again about the Oysters &  the Pork Rinds. Again, they'll check. Are you getting the idea? RESULT:: Oysters never made it. Pork Rinds never made it. We actually watched as the Oysters which never made it to our table, were simply thrown away. Yep, sloppy management practices lent itself to witnessing the manager, in the middle of the dining room, assess the situation and approve OR instruct the staff to throw away the defrosted oysters knowing that at this point we were definitely going to reject them. Especially since the guest who ordered them had already desensitized her tongue with her spicy mussels which were delivered before anything else. I may not have even bothered going into such detail here except that when we thought explaining to the manager might help in the future (at this point we decided dinner here tonight just wasn't worth the hassle) He just kept shaking his head saying there was nothing he could do, took no responsibility in his share of this debacle & admitted that he was also NEW! He felt taking the Oysters & Pork Rinds off the bill was doing us a favor. Yeah, Thanks Eduardo for not charging us for what we NEVER got! Was he serious? Unfortunately YES! This isn't just an \"off\" night if this is how the MANAGER responded. It's an indication of whats to come. Unfortunate, because it's a good concept & not much competition in this type of restaurant cuisine."}
{"text":"Overpriced small no seasoning swimming in water crawfish. We were told they don't season so u can taste the crawfish we ordered 10 spice hoping for taste no luck 14$/lb and the etouffee was bland as well the spice was there no problem on spices but someone need to introduce them to some Cajun spices Tony chachere to make it easy and ur a beginner these people are clearly just doing something on the strip and attract customers by their name nobody there is from where crawfish are popular just pretenders."}
{"text":"Tonight was one of many family gatherings at this specific location in Glendale at Westgate, the last time my family came they warned me it may be the last but tonight is definitely the last. After ANOTHER 30 minute wait our table of 10 + (as per usual) was finally seated, told from the beginning we'd have to split the order in 3 bills. Management was not accommodating when multiple orders were incorrect and instead blamed us. The food was good as always, but for the third time our checks were messed up, our waitress charged the wrong orders to the wrong cards and various prices. After which we waited another 20 minutes for a to-go side order of 2 ears of corn and a potato and another 30 minutes for a margarita ordered at the bar that ended up being a shot of tequila for the sake of just leaving at this point. The food is always delicious but the ever changing staff is more inconsiderate with each new group. I don't know where else you can get a decently seasoned pound of ready to peel shrimp and crab legs in this desert but my family and I will be on a mission to find one ASAP! And keep in mind I literally live across the street from Westgate and at this point I'm willing to give the Tempe location a try in hopes for better service, even placing a to go order is like pulling teeth!w"}
{"text":"we had to wait about 20 minutes for our seat but it was worth it. the service was super nice. the choices were great! we ordered 4 pounds of crawfish, 2 pounds of shrimp, 1 pound of blue crab, extra corn and sides of rice. OMG. i love it when my mouth is on fire and this was a great experience. they offered gloves if you didn't want to get your hands super spicy and they offered bibs! refills were frequent and the staff were attentive. i really enjoyed everything!!!"}
{"text":"It's like boiling crab in the south bay...so if you've tried something similar, this place is not worth the trek. Personally, I don't think this type of food is worth a hour wait anywhere."}
{"text":"This place is really cool. The music is pumping and the food is really tasty.. I had the poor boy catfish sandwich, finger licking good (Sorry KFC)..  a must when u visit sin city"}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place. Once we figured out what spice level was tolerable for us we've been regulars. I know they're known for their crawfish, but I'm a shrimp lover. Their hot and juicy baby spicy pound of shrimp and Cajun fries is what lures me back there everytime.   Be prepared to get messy! I recommend wearing the bib and a couple pairs of gloves. A must try!"}
{"text":"Downright awful - shrimp were way overcooked - total mush.  Spice blend all water - nothing flavored the meat (makes me wonder if shrimp were pre-cooked and dumped in bag of spice soup)  And we had a lot- of people - not just one bad batch  Mussles were ok Corn fritters didn't have much fritternessx- chunks of corn fried  Not at all pleased  Mushy shrimp = bleh"}
{"text":"Friday night wasn't too crowded at 6pm.  I had the snow crab in hot n juicy sauce, medium spiciness.  Server said it was tabasco-like hotness but it really wasn't.  I'll get a spicier one next time.  The server was really nice.  The place is clean.  The crabs were cooked well.  The crab meat wasn't sticking to the shell.  My dinner was $21, this included 1lbs crab, corn & soda.  Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"This place is located in Chinatown. About 5 five minutes off the strip. The place doesn't look like much. But its great place to crawfish and seafood. The estouffe is fantastic and the corn fritters are amazing. Everything is boiled in season stock and comes inside a plastic bag. Service is very good and friendly. Food is spicy and full of flavors. Try it you won't regret this place"}
{"text":"Wanted to love this place as it's set up and atmosphere paired with boiled seafood is a perfect combination for Vegas. However, the seafood and in particular, the shrimp was over boiled and hard to peel and mushy. Shame as the creole seasoning is awesome and the vegetables (corn and potatoes as part of the boil) could not have been better. Here is to hoping it was a tough night and it's such a good idea for the area and being from the South I will try it again. It's a great departure from all the stuffy and over the top places on the strip that take themselves so serious.   Location on the outside of Planet Hollywood mall is great. Hostess was a little challenging but waitstaff was very attentive and always coming around. Please tighten up on the food!"}
{"text":"In Vegas had to try this place! It was just as awesome as the one in Orlando!!!  The place was very busy and the waiters was hustling. Waiter forgot one order but made up for it. Very nice place."}
{"text":"I eat crawfish all the time back home, and all my friends had said hot n juicy is really good, comparable to boiling crab, so we gave it a try today.. And it was eh. Very disappointing. The hot n juicy sauce was alright. It was a mixture of garlic butter, lemon pepper and what not. Make sure to shake up the bag for all the garlic at the bottom! Either way, the sauce was okay not that flavorful unless you pick up a crawfish with all the garlic on it. I had to order a extra side of spicier sauce.. We ordered 5lb and the crawfish was all small. Every 2lb comes with free corn and potato which was cool, but neither had any flavor either. I don't know. Maybe it was an off day, or it's just this location. Cause my friend who was also dining with me did not even touch her 2lb, she said Chinatown is much better? Idk but never again. Was not worth our 100$. We could've ate a buffet instead."}
{"text":"My family has been coming here since we first moved to Las Vegas in 2011. Best flavor in town when it comes to this type of dining. Choose your flavor, your spice level and get to it. The customer service is awesome as well. Get there before their peak hours, it gets packed!"}
{"text":"They have a simple small variety of seafood selection. You order by the pound and it depends on the market value of the day.   I order a pound of a shrimp which is about $12 a pound today with lemon pepper sauce and mild seasoning. The rest of my family order a couple pounds of crawfish with a really high spice level.  The sauce was really watery when I received my bag of shrimp. It was still tasty and I enjoyed every single piece of shrimp they gave. I was hoping the sauce would be thicker to stick on the shrimp better.  When I sampled a couple of my families crawfish, the spice level was too much for me. I am not really into spicy food so be aware of the spice level you choose.   The customer service was okay. A little bit slow on refilling on drinks and hard to find a server to ask for a few condiments such as ketchup.  Overall experience was good. I'd come back here whenever I crave seafood and to try out their different seafood and sauce."}
{"text":"Great seafood restaurant for family and friends. Depending on time of day but dinner time it usually is busy so expect to wait for a bit for a table.  Pretty simple menu to read and they offer a few selection of seafood by the pound. It depends how much based on the market price of the day but it is not too bad.   First you order what seafood you want and how many pounds. Usually a pound or 2 is good per person. Next is the type of seasoning and then the spice level. Servers usually warn you that the medium spice level is kind of spicy.   There is also a back side of the menu where they offer sides such as corn, rice, rolls etc. They also offer domestic and premium beers as well.  I usually order a pound of shrimp and their hot n juicy sauce which is a combination of all their sauces mixed together. I also order a corn mixed with the sauce and side of sweet potato fries.  The seafood you order delivers in a hot bag with the sauce of your choice. The shrimp you have to peel the skin yourself which makes the experience fun and enjoyable. You could also ask for a side of lemon, salt and pepper to add a little more taste to your food.   If you don't like getting messy, they have gloves you can use and oh they also give you a plastic bib too so you won't make a mess on your shirt because it could get messy.  There is a huge roll of paper towel so there is plenty to go around if you need to clean up.   Overall the food taste great. Came out in a reasonable amount of time. Food is nice and hot. Our drinks were always topped off.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. I ordered snow crabs legs and my husband ordered shrimp. I think they were both over cooked, but decent. The seasoning saved it. The service is slow and lagging. We both had sodas that didn't get refilled once till we were done and our mouths were on fire. They seem well staffed, but just kinda all over the place. Very nice staff though."}
{"text":"This is  great place to take your friends and Family and enjoy some great tasting shrimp and eat with your hands ;).....I recommend Hot and Juicy special sauce and mild spice cuz it is too spicey otherwise,unless thats your thing......a must try in Vegas"}
{"text":"I must admit, when the taxi dropped me off, I was nervous ... it doesn't look like much from the outside.   ... but the minute you walk in, like a SLAP IN THE FACE, the garlic buttery cajun smell hits you and you know you are in for some good eatin'   Once inside the restaurant is clean and there is plenty of room. The tables are covered in plastic and there are professionals here that actually bring surgical gloves to do their grubbin'   The waitress recommended a mild hot n' juicy seasoning for our shellfish feast, which was the perfect amount of heat for me - might be too much for some.   The crawfish were the best but the shrimp & king crab legs come in close second.   It was such a fun experience for all of us, we had a blast, probably the most fun I have ever had at lunch!"}
{"text":"The place is usually packed but you're looking at maybe a 20-30 minute wait at most, unless you have a large group. Because it's so busy, sometimes the staff forgets that you asked for more water, or more lemons or tobasco. It's somewhat acceptable when they're crazy busy, but I've also seen them semi neglect customers because they're busy chatting with each other, which isn't professional, BUT the food really is that good, that you'll probably come back for more."}
{"text":"As an Orange County native, I hate to admit it but this Hot N Juicy blows Boiling Crab out of the water!!   My man and I ordered a pound and a half of shrimp(hot n juicy;medium)  The shrimp were huge!! They were so full of flavor and the juices just give it that extra kick!!   My husband ordered a pound of clams and he's not impressed. That's one thing he likes a bit more about boiling crab! But the shrimp there were not as pleasing!  Seems like the clams were half pound of juice and half pound of clams!    We will definitely be back here again!!      Minus"}
{"text":"OMG....this stuff is like CRACK! This is what I'm going to miss from Vegas.   My sister, brother and friend went on Sunday afternoon and we ordered:  Soft Shell Crab - It was good and the fries had a kick to it. Etouffee - Flavorful and pretty spicy. 1 lb. Crawfish - Lots of work, but fun to eat. 1 lb. Clams - These were actually pretty disappointing. Also, seemed to be more empty shells than clams. 1 lb. Shrimp - OMG....I'm not a big shrimp fan, but I ate so many of these.  We went back Monday with two other friends and ordered:  Fried Shrimp - These were ok, but the batter was a bit too thick. Cajun Fries - Still had a kick to it. 2 lb. Crawfish extra corn - Still was good 2 lb. Shrimp - YUM! 2 lb. Snow Crab - Oh these were good too, but one of our friend inhaled most of it.......I know not to go with him again. 1 lb. Clams - Yeah, I would stay away from these as they are not worth it. 7 Garlic Butter Corn - These were so good. We ordered 4 first and we ended up ordering an additional 3. Must try these!  We ordered mild for all of it and it does make your tongue and lips burn, but seems to fade away by the time you leave. I am definitely going to go CRAZY next time and try......medium! =)  I thought the staff was awesome. There was a mix up and they ended up giving us 1 lb. snow crab on the house which most places wouldn't. Awesome!  I also thought the prices to be very reasonable!   Can't wait to go back! This is going to our place to go when in Vegas."}
{"text":"I'm so glad they have one on the Strip now. We planned to go to the Chinatown location, but saw this one.   The Drool - 1 lb Crawfish, 1 lb Shrimp, dozen Andouille Sausages,  2  Corns and 2 Potatoes  1/2 lb Snow Crab & Cajun Calamari   We went with the Hot & Juicy Medium spice. I thought the food was good, but seems they toned down the spice level. It made my lips tingle, but thought it would have been a bit more spicy. We enjoyed everything, but wasn't too fond of the sausage.  Will be back when I return to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Delicious food as always.. Service was average. Staff seems bored, not very knowledgeable of menu"}
{"text":"Gotta love my seafood :p  Note: If you are not korean, do NOT order extra spicy hahah my friends were sweating bricks except for me and this other korean dude lol  Food is bomb-tastic.. so go eat there if you live in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Always good, prices are fair. If you like boil style seafood that is the menu! Service is dicey, take out orders can be brutal."}
{"text":"I drove around and around oblivious to this place....until I realized the sign. Unfortunately the sign isn't as eye catching as I had hoped. I ended up coming here for Teri C.'s Bday party. Reggie grabbed me while I wandered around aimlessly. Maybe I was just having an off day and I was a little out of it?  You walk into this quaint little restaurant. and there's a bunch of tables, some of them are dressed with plastic covering...Oh yes. Grandaddy Crawfish Killa is here...The menu isn't big at all - dungeness, crawfish, shrimp, etc....with different levels of spice. I had to get the nosebleed(Ok not on the menu) - Yes this spice was definitely a creeper. But it wasn't nosebleed enough for me. They had a special of crawfish etouffe which was good but not enough heat.  When the crawfish come....well normally in Louisiana they're steamed in a water broth. The crawfish here....are put in a bag....with butter....garlic, spices, etc...Yea. WTF Talk about a cholesterol issue. Good luck with that! BUT IT'S SO FREAKING GOOD. I ordered two lbs...It was tedious having to pick out the meat. The crawfish this time wasn't as big as I was used to - but still good. I needed I definitely liked the sausage too! I couldn't finish it though....I wanted rice and I talked to one of the guys...definitely will try to incorporate rice or bread to the menu.  I did have to knock them for the portions of rice only because it felt like I was being rationed off on Survivor. I can't wait to go back. But this time - I'd like my crawfish shelled :)"}
{"text":"I love going to this place. We've been going here since they opened and they weren't even that busy. Now they have so many stores. I think that the hot n juicy sauce is one of the best. I've never had a bad meal here yet. The only downfall is, you might get a little messy and you guarantee will leave that place smelling like garlic. But you can't beat the flavors."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! HJ is one of my fave places to grub(and I mean GRUB). Delicious food, excellent service, and reasonably priced are qualities that makes this restaurant SO awesome! This place can get packed but totally worth the wait!"}
{"text":"OMG.....shrimp with Hot and Juicy Special sauce on extra spicy level.  I'm hooked now.  And I'm thinking about this all the time now. at the gym, home and work...  I work on the strip hotel and drove by this place every day on my way to work.  But I'd never thought I would eat  here. Looking from outside... is not so fancy.  I was totally wrong  The best seafood ever. My husband is a executive chef and he is always sooooooo critical about every food we order.  Even he is hooked.  Highly recommending."}
{"text":"The restaurant is off the strip. So keep in mind its really hard to get a cab heading back to the strip.   Never compare this place to the boiling crab because its incomparable!! LOL...  As my friends and sister enjoy their succulent and delicious crawfish, and shrimp, it wasnt too spicy as it was more of a mild flavor.  I had ordered the chicken nuggets and fries basket, i know i know why did I order that but I was hungover and I needed comfort food!!"}
{"text":"The food was really good but the service we received was even better! The hostess had a lot of personality but she was thorough. Nick went above and beyond as a waiter if you ask me. He cracked open crawfish for 6 ppl so we can try it...Wasn't even necessary. overall, we left happy and full."}
{"text":"I am very upset with Hot N Juicy Crawfish I was there on Tuesday April 10 and ordered the Get Your Feet Wet Combo (Mild) for take out. I did not get to taste it before I left or until later when I got home.   It wasn't mild it was the hottest they could find my mouth burned and sweat poured from me I was unable to eat this 35.00 that included tip meal.  It is still sitting in my refrigerator in case the manager would like me to bring it back and take a taste of it."}
{"text":"SCREW THE CASINOS, CLUBS, AND BUFFETS!!  Vegas is good for ONLY ONE thing and that's Hot N Juicy Crawfish!  This is by far (and don't worry I edit) the BEST crawfish shack I've ever grubbed at.  The crawfish is literally piping HOT and JUICY.  I ordered the house seasoning, which was finger-licking-good!  There are two bummers though-- one, it's pricey &  two, it gets packed.    Of all the things to gamble on, this is a sure bet! ;)  FYI-All the fancy pants eaters have been forewarned because this place is for those that aren't afraid of getting nitty-gritty with their food!"}
{"text":"I have eaten several times at this restaurant and have not been disappointed. My first time eating at the restaurant was during the premiere of Hot n' Juicy's spot on the Travel Channel, Man v. Food and I have been a regular since.   Moving to Vegas I found it was hard to locate the locally owned, unique restaurants. If you are looking for a unique restaurant with great seafood (hard to find in a desert), then check out Hot n' Juicy.  I feel like family when I visit and the servers are incredibly helpful in suggestions on what to eat.  This restaurant has great service, awesome seafood (try the snow crab!!), and offers a one-of-a-kind, affordable experience hard to find in the Las Vegas area. The best part? Your seafood doesn't come out on a plate. How does it come out then? I'll guess you'll just have to go see for yourself. Let's just say it is a hands on experience.    A regular meal for me includes at least a pound of snow crabs and a dozen sausage. For those who are looking for a milder juice lemon pepper is the way to go!"}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch today and had a pound of crawfish in half a pound of shrimp. The Crawfish were good juicy cooked well as well as  the shrimp.you I have the garlic butter and I had the lemon pepper and Mild spice. Crawfish were good but their shrimp where much larger than I was expecting. When I go next time I'm definitely sticking to the shrimp for the best value. I will go back next time I'm in the area and we tried some more. I will note that it was slow when I was there for a late lunch and the service was fine."}
{"text":"Came here last week in the evening decided to get off of the strip. Ok so my first thoughts when I entered was GHETTO but I had heard the crab was THE BOMB. Catfish was delicious and when they say the sauce is spicy they are NOT PLAYIN!! I had the Soft Shell Crab it was tasty. The Hawaiian sweet rolls were crusty hard, HELLO that is not how they are supposed to be served.  Do not expect tremendous amazing service it was very casual and they were young and busy and seem to just want to make sure you got your beverages and order and that was IT! I think their clientele isn't necessarily looking for more so I get the feeling that is why they don't try harder.  My advice if you are a local order take out. If you are a visitor take heed.  Respectfully Reviewed"}
{"text":"Since my last update, I have gotten a response from the owner of this place.  However, since I haven't logged on in a while I responded a month late.  Im awaiting a call and im glad to see that management is putting an effort to work on this issue."}
{"text":"It was my first time at Hot N Juicy & I loved it! Our waiter was the best! Made us feel super comfortable! Even showed us how to crack open some crab legs lol! Overall experience was amazing! The crab legs & shrimp with the hot n juicy seasoning is to die for! Oh and not to mention those Cajun fries were bomb!"}
{"text":"Ooooh!!! Hot N Juicy Crawfish!!!  I was skeptical about trying Hot N Juicy Crawfish, because I was an avid fan of Boiling Crab (yes, I am one of the crazy ones who wait in line for hours). My friend insisted that I try it, so I did.   First, I didnt have to wait for hours! Our servers were polite and were knowledgeable about their menu. I had 1 lb of shrimp(cajun, mild), corn and bowl of rice. Order came quickly, and my oh my. I am now a Hot N Juicy Crawfish convert. :) their shrimps were fresh and huge. My corn was also perfect.   This place can have my money any day!"}
{"text":"I have to say that I am quite impressed! I thought that Hot N Juicy was just another Boiling Crab knock off but in a sense it is actually better than it's competition.  The shrimp are of better quality and size and the sauces aren't too garlic filled. I actually left the restaurant without my my fingertips smelling like garlic for 2 days. (You know what I'm talking about. Haha)   The service was amazing! We had two servers that were helping my party of 6 and they were friendly, attentive and very fun. They made the experience even a better one.   The ambiance is even better than being at boiling crab! It still is fun but more warm (welcoming) and not as loud so you can actually hear what people at your table are saying."}
{"text":"Although I always leave smelling like I just rolled around in a puddle of garlic and butter, I absolutely love it!  I usually order a half a pound of the mild Hot and Juicy Shrimp with 2 corns and a side of rice. The calamari (regular) is really good and the sweet potato fries always leave me craving for more. The oysters are good and of decent quality.   The service was amazing! We had two servers that were helping my party of 4 and they were friendly, attentive and very fun. They made the experience even a better one. We were even given a \"girls of hot n juicy calendar\" that had a selection of their workers from different locations holding seafood. It was really funny and fun to look at. We got a kick  out of the model dressed up in an elegant gown holding up crab legs. My friend made a joke saying \"When you're classy AF but got crabs...\" hahaha. The waitress thought it was hilarious. She also gave us mardi gras beads and bud light bottle openers. It was a great dine in experience.  I definitely like HnJ better than boiling crab! It still is fun but more warm (welcoming) and not as loud so you can actually hear what people at your table are saying. I feel like the shrimp are bigger and of better quality and the waitresses are more fun and personable.  If i I could, I would eat here every day!"}
{"text":"Hot N Juicy is THE BEST. Ever since my husband and I discovered this place, we have been ADDICTED. My husband loves the crawfish and I love their shrimp. Their garlic butter sauce is to die for.  The place opens at noon- and by that time, there are usually people waiting to get in. Sometimes getting a soda refill can take 10 minutes, but it is SOOOOO worth it."}
{"text":"Wow, these places are everywhere! It's funny too because it's like Asian Cajun! I assume only in California and it's closest neighbor Vegas have places like this.  I actually really like this place. The spices they use in their signature Hot-N-Juicy is off the hook, much better than Crawdaddy (in San Jose) and right up there if not better than Boiling Crab (in San Jose). We ordered the King Crab Legs in butter and garlic and Hot-N-Juicy in mild and medium as we were all wimps, Shrimp in Hot-N-Juicy in medium also, Cajun Fries, Sweet Potato Fries and Corn on the Cob and Potatoes! I love that they serve the corn on the cob and potato in the bag with the juices, the other places mentioned above don't and they don't have potatoes either. They also have blue crab here which the ones in San Jose don't have. Can't wait to go here again!  The service wasn't the best, they forgot the fries and I had to keep asking for water. But all in all this is a good off the strip joint for those staying in town for the weekend. Get there early because I hear there is usually a wait, sounds like all the other places too!"}
{"text":"I came here since the opening of this location and never been disappointed. I always order the hot and juicy seasoning on the crawfish and the shrimps. The area is easy to find but sometimes parking is a little hectic. Food is always delicious and fresh!"}
{"text":"came here for lunch because i've been wanting to find a good crawfish joint in las vegas and boiling crab just isn't cutting it.  there are two hot n juicy on spring mountain and we went to the one that ISN'T next to pho kim long. you are greeted and served by a bunch of attractive girls and they all have head phones on. the crawfish here is pretty good but definitely nothing compare to houston's. (i love crazy cajun) we ordered the hot n juicy special with level spicy, but next time i'll definitely go for extra spicy. i also tried a little bit of the sausage and it was yummy!   i'd go back again when i'm craving crawfish & i do recommend this place if you're ever in town and craving seafood.  P.S they also have chicken nuggets and wings and such for kids."}
{"text":"Excuse me mam?  Did you say an hour wait?  (Thinking) \"WTF, are you serious.  This S%$T better be good\"  I gave this place a try 3 times already, and each time was horrible.  I really cant believe this place is highly rated.  I mean the best part was paying for the bill and leaving.  Service sucked, Food wasn't fresh, Shrimped looked like the shrimp from walmart (Frozen little kind), and having lived down south in Biloxi, MS the seasoning was whack!  It seemed like they just put more seasoning in the bag to hide the fact that the shrimp or crawfish taste like rubber.  Why do so many people flock to the so-called \"hole in the wall\".  I'll tell you why, its because they paid to be on TV.    \"Well they wouldn't be on TV if they weren't good\"   Listen up.....the Detroit Lions are on TV every football season.  That still doesn't mean they're good.  LOL  (I can say that I was born there)  Go down the road to Cajun Crawfish, there's no wait, service is not as slow, and the seasoning is more authentic (in my opinion).  If I have offended anyone with this post, go eat there and you'll understand.  If you like it.....more power to you."}
{"text":"So good, it'll make you think twice about SETTLING for mediocre Boiling Crab.  the seasoning/sauce they have is great and definitely a welcome change from the thick, saucy, and salty marinade that Boiling Crab has.   prices were reasonable (1lb shrimp $10) and so forth...  my friends and i got the breaded catfish (so-so, kinda bland unless you drenched them in tartar sauce, shrimp (delish), and crawfish (not really a fan of them, but still enjoyable).  service was friendly and efficient. bathrooms are on the right side of the restaurant down a narrow hallway, single occupancy per gender.  loved that there was no line and that it was a very short taxi cab trip from the strip!  will definitely come back again when i'm back in Sin City!"}
{"text":"Place is so bomb! They have two locations in Arizona and i believe the tempe location is a little better but either way both of them are still taste so good!"}
{"text":"Saw this place on man v food so I had to come in.  What a tourist...I know.  I've never had crawfish before I came here so I was excited.  Parking can suck as the lot gets crowded but there is parking on the street with no sidewalk.  That works I guess.    Lucky for me I had a huge paper cut on my thumb so I was praying they had gloves and they did. Whew.  My fiance got the crawfish medium and I got the shrimp spicy.  They come and bags, you rip the bag open and then go at it.  It's super hot and the gloves actually helped.  I think you get the best bang for your buck with the shrimp, as the crawfish is all shell.  The crawfish heads are delicious though, smoky woodsy flavor.  However, the shrimp are the way to go, easier eating, more substance, similar flavors.  My glove did get punctured and that spicy sauce going into my paper cut was a great feeling, but not as bad as sauce going into my eye when I accidentally scratched my eye.  Comedy of errors.    We stopped here on our last two visits to Vegas and think we will continue to do so.  Haven't found a place in LA that competes yet."}
{"text":"Not as good as a remember, but only have went to the other original location down the street.  Came in on a saturday afternoon around 1 and it wasn't packed at all.  No wait and food came out in about 10 minutes or less.  Service was adequate but the food was just so so.  Ordered a lb of shrimp and an lb of crawfish, medium spice level.  We used to love this place but not so much anymore.  Don't get me wrong, it's far from bad but maybe we just got used to the Boiling Crab's seasoning.  It's slightly different and we found H&J's to be slightly more spiced/gritty.  Overall was ok, but just prefer Boiling Crab more."}
{"text":"The crawfish were a bit challenging to eat. Be aware that their mild is still on the spicy side. I don't even want to imagine what their \"extra spicy\" sauce does to your mouth.   Oh yeah, also, you can order half pounds of the creatures you order to eat.  Be ready to spend some time and some money when you eat there."}
{"text":"So finger lickin' good.   The epitome of my dining experience here was not only watching myself and my friends devour the whole menu but the finale to the great dinner began at the restroom's line to wash my hands..   Two minutes into my wait in line, the young gentlewoman in front of me helped triple confirmed how delicious this place was when I struggled to keep myself from awkwardly admiring her as she licked her fingers clean. Classy woman was ~5 feet away from the restroom and probably only had to wait another minute for her turn at the sink.   Well, ain't no body got time to wash your 'Hot N Juicy' fingers at the sink when you're here!  Stay classy and put your cool bib on before you get your sanitized hands on what we ordered:  -As many lbs of shrimps you can handle -Dozens of fresh oysters -Sausages -Sweet potato fries -Fried cat fish -Calamari -Fried chicken wings! -Beers for the whole party  We also ordered the crawfish but I'm not a big fan of working so much for a little piece of meat. I did have a couple and it wasn't very impressive so it'd be my last recommendation to order. Spicy here is truly spicy - you'll get the heads up before ordering as well!  Also, be mindful not to ask for the 'whole-shebang' here or you'll get some Hot N Juicy stares from the waiters/waitresses. Just kidding, you'll just get kindly reminded that you're not at Boiling Crab and it's crowned the \"Hot and Juicy Special\" sauce here - could've been more saucily creative than that methinks but the taste is very up to par."}
{"text":"Never fails to disappoint. I've tried many places like this such as boiling crab etc. but I always find my way back to Hot N Juicy. Their sauce is sooo good. I like to get the Hot and Juicy special, extra spicy :) My favorite is to just get a pound of shrimp with the corn in the bag. I love how the extra spicy is actually spicy. Haha. I've gone to many places and their extra spicy is not spicy at all. I also love the bits of garlic in the sauce. Cajun fries are bomb! So is the calamari.  And if you're feeling a bit adventurous and like lemon pepper flavor, ask for lemons and black pepper salt. Squeeze a couple lemons into the sauce cup with the salt and pepper mixture. Mix the hot n juicy sauce with the lemon in your rice. So delicious! Haha. Also make sure to ask for gloves if you don't want to have your hands smelling or if you have cuts on your hands.   Service was great. The wait wasn't even that long despite how busy it was. Our server also checked up on us a couple times, which was great.   Definitely will come back!"}
{"text":"My first experience was a wonderful one.  Not a big fan of crawfish, but loved the shrimp soaked in hot n juicy sauce.  I can inhale a whole pound myself.  Mmmm... protein yay!!!!! Tasted my friend's super spicy crawfish, I swear my lips were comparable to Jay Z's.  Service was fast and friendly.  Except for the homeboy with the glue on black nails.  I hope he wasnt the one cooking up of crawfish.  God knows what is in those freakin press on.  YUCK.  Price is very very reasonable.  The pound of shrimp purchased was only $9.99.  No need for rice.  Must get cajun fries for $1, a dozen of sausage for $4, corn $.60 each, and potato $.60 each (potato is not that exciting, id rather get a corn)."}
{"text":"Yeah, this place is good.  In comparison to Claws and Boiling Crab in the OC, I like this place too.  The people I went with don't eat very spicy food, so the waiter dude recommended mild heat which was still good.  We had crawdads, shrimp, and clams, and crab legs.  Decent service, eye-candy patrons, TV's and beers on tap.  I will come back!  That ish is VEGAS, son!   BTW, to all you whiners that complain about waiting an hour to eat, TOO BAD! We got lucky and seated 7 right away by calling ahead and checking first before making the effort to go there."}
{"text":"I find it only fair to mention that I hail from the south and have had the best in boiled crawfish most of my life. I thought I would be getting the same quality since the owners are from Houston. Crawfish is not on par with anything from Houston or any part of Louisiana but since there are no alternatives in Vegas, I would have to say it's the best crawfish place (and I think the only one) in town. It is listed on The Best of Las Vegas but I've found that list to be a disappointment.   I was disappointed that they charge extra for red potatoes and corn on the cob. All the other patrons seem to always be amazed at seeing crawfish and that we know how to peel them and suck the heads. This just adds to my impression that people are easily impressed and amused here. Prices are moderate but I still don't feel like I'm getting my money's worth due to the portion size.   Crawfish is not really fresh due to the fact that we're in the Mohave Desert. I guess I just have a higher standard having had Crawfish in New Orleans and all over Louisiana countless times. Everyone else raves about this place I suppose because they have nothing to compare it to. I'm sure I'll be back when I have another crawfish jones but I just feel they could do better.   It's always blazing hot in the restaurant no matter what time of day I've been in there. I guess they are trying to save money?   Don't have enough bathrooms."}
{"text":"Best seafood place I've ever been to!  Go in with a plan though cause if you let your eyes order your chec can get pretty high (when ordering for a family).  My 6 yr son orders the catfish platter and he loves it.  I order the shrimp and crab legs with the seasoning that is a combo of all of the flavors (forget what its called).  If you take the sauce the shrimp is in and poor it over rice its sooooo good!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for years after hearing such great reviews about this place! I visited Vegas with my girlfriends one weekend and was adamant about coming to this restaurant. We started our lunch off with a basket of garlic cajun fries to share. The fries tasted mediocre and I don't recall tasting any \"cajun\" flavoring. I also ordered a pound of garlic shrimp at mild with added corn and sausage. The bag came out piping hot when our server brought it out to us.  The sauce was mediocre; nothing spectacular that made me wanting to come back for more. My corn tasted 2 days old which of course I told our server! She was at least nice enough to remove it off our bill. :)   After having such high expectations for this place, I realized this restaurant is totally overrated! I still prefer my Boiling Crab over this place any day!!"}
{"text":"GET 2lbs of shrimp with mild garlic butter, 2 corn on cob in butter, half a dozen sausages, sweet potato fries, and a bowl of rice for party of two! It's perfect!   DON'T GET calamari rings, as you get so little for what you pay; $12.   Melissa?Melody? The team leader of the restaurant was a very very good server!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food I have ever tried. The place is clean and cozy. Our server Daniel was professional, friendly and made the recommendations for our food. 4 star experience overall."}
{"text":"Saw this place many times when visiting Pho #1, but never plan to try it until I saw it on Man vs Food. Even though I had better Cajun style crawfish in Houston, this place is not bad. Compared with all the cajun style crawfish and shrimp place in Vegas, this place is actually awesome. For those who compared this place to other places in California, DON'T. THIS IS NOT CALIFORNIA. My buddies and I made quite regular visit to this place when we want a place to drink and munch on some good seafood.  Cold beer + spicy shrimp/crawfish = yum yum. One advice - the dungent crab is very expensive and doesn't absorb the sauce flavor good, so all you have is one expensive steamlike crab."}
{"text":"Service is horrific. Food is ok, but due to the lousy service, it gets one star. It is like a restaurant if village idiots. Will not be back. Angry crab Ahwatukee far exceeds this place, in flavor and service."}
{"text":"I don't know which Hot N Juicy I'm reviewing... I just know that they're on the same street. So I'm sorry this is the wrong one... but they're all good so it doesn't matter! I really like Hot N Juicy because all of their restaurants are SO CONSISTENT. East to West everything is well managed and the food is always AMAZING!  I love the sauce at Hot N Juicy, it is definately in the Top 3 in my crawfish eating adventures. I love the ratio of sour, cajun and just heavenly goodness. You can never go with the crawfish here, they are fresh, good sized and perfectly cooked! If anything is off, just let your server know and they'll take care of it.   Love their baskets as well, catfish is plentiful.. and kind of tastes like cod in my opinion... weird... I was expecting fishy! It's ok cod is good too. The fries they have are better than Boiling Crab because they are more starchy and taste more real! Love dunking fries in Ranch sauce. I'm not much of a fan of Gulf Oysters, but my company sure loved them, they were really plump and a nice medium size. Oh and Hot N Juicy is the ONLY crawfish place that has  The place is really messy though, that's my one complaint, I know they're busy but still at least wipe down and sweep a little. We were literally sitting on oil and crawfish shells it was a bit weird... Service is awesome, everyone who works at Hot N Juicy is so upbeat and chill. Food is fast and communication between FOH and BOH is instant since they have good In-N-Out like headsets (it's pretty funny). This location is pretty big so big parties would fit, the ambiance is cozy and nice (not as trashy as BC)."}
{"text":"The concept of putting seafood in a bag of sauce is a great idea. It allows the sauce to saturate into the seafood. With that being said make sure to allow several minutes for the sauce to soak in after receiving you bag for the best experience.   Though the concept is done by many places now, but it's the sauce that keeps me coming back! Myself being a spice lover, I always get the extra spicy, hot n juicy sauce! It definitely has a kick but what's awesome about the spice is that no matter how much sweat, huffing and puffing, I still wanted more! Now that's how a sauce should be. Definitely a sauce to recommend!   I always get the oysters because for some reason they have really big and creamy oysters! I don't know how they do it but that creamy taste wins it from other places! I also get the snow crab, shrimp and King grab which can't go wrong! Also if you want crawfish I would recommended going when it's in season (around spring time) you'll get the big batch!   I've been coming back here often and sometimes I actually crave it. Glad I can just drive 1.5 hrs from Tucson to enjoy it as oppose of going to Las Vegas or California! Taste it, love it, Yelp it!"}
{"text":"This place burned a hole in my stomach.   I'm not kidding. I went to the doctor, and I was on prescription-strength antacids for nearly a month.   BUT IT WAS WORTH IT!  Here's the deal: you buy a bag of seafood, pick your sauce, and they dump it on the table. We got 1 lb. of shrimp and 2 lbs of crawfish, as per our server's recommendation -- and it was WAY too much for 2 hefty, hefty eaters. The shrimp, especially. Ye gods. Now, don't get me wrong, it was delicious, but there is a lot of meat on each plump and tender morsel.  My favorite was the crawfish, with their signature sauce. It's incredibly flavorful, and the red potato and corn can't be beat. You pick it apart with your bare hands. My fingertips got bath-tub wrinkled. How primal. Yes, you can ask for gloves. Yes, you're less of a (wo)man for doing so.   Anyway, well worth a quick cab or car ride from the strip, not too expensive for what you get, cute waitresses. And you get a calendar. Bravo!"}
{"text":"I've been three times since my last review. Thanks to management for really taking pride in assuring their customer's are taken care of. Each time has been a better experience than the initial and I will definitely be back and bringing friends to try! I dinked them a star because one of the times, the spices were crazy intense and their crawfish were on much smaller than I anticipated and would have liked, but neither of which will stop me from going in!"}
{"text":"We were really craving some crawfish so decided to try this place out. The food was good. Very pricey compared to what I'm used to back home. The crawfish were kind of small in my opinion for the middle of the season. They also charge for getting extra crawfish sauce to dip in so be wary. We got the corn, sausages, black mussels, crawfish and shrimp in the hot n juicy flavor. The flavoring was decent, not bad but for the price and size I would think twice the next time. The sausage pieces they give you are tiny I would've thought they would come out as bigger pieces, but they're pretty thin and not worth it. The crawfish can be small, the mussels were the least satisfying, but the shrimp were the best here. The shrimp were good sizes and were very sweet tasting and flavor-some. Will probably try a different place before going here again."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place as cajun food and crawfish and gulf shrimp special to my heart. The meal began great with no wait and a very friendly and encouraging hostess who sat us promptly and explained the concept. We ordered the crawfish, clams, shrimp and snow crab. Each arrived at different times in plastic bags but within 20 minutes from ordering. I am a chef, so maybe I see things that others don't. The shrimp were served head on which should be reserved. for only fresh caught as the brains spoil within a day and these had been spoiled a few days ago. The heavy spiced sauce covered the taste. The clams were good and tasty but 8 shells per pound had no clam inside which was a letdown. I scoured the bottom of the bag hoping to find the missing clams to no avail, they must be in the boil pot which made me disappointed to psy for just shells. The snow crab was mushy and does not pare well with the over spiced sauces, my ordering fault. Our server was friendly but we never saw her again after taking iur order but maybe they share tables as we were serviced by 3 others. All in all a unique idea but lacking in quality fot the price paid. I almost want to try again as I love crab and shrimp boils but to spend $60 for 2 to walk away hungry and question the quality is too much for me. I wish them well but will not be back or reccomend."}
{"text":"I went here a few nights ago for the first time, and was very satisfied. The food is messy, but so delicious! I will be going back!"}
{"text":"This place is love.   I mean many things by that.  First and most obvious, the food is fire. In the literal and figurative sense. I get my shrimp Hot N Juicy seasoning (if you don't get Hot N Juicy seasoning, you should really question every aspect of your life) and at the \"Spicy\" spice level. Thus, after my meal, I am covered in sweat and have contact burns all over my knuckles/fingers. (They do provide gloves, but I always manage to rip mine when cracking shrimp bc i am a novice)  But I am also extremely happy because its so delicious. Thus, the pain and misery I am subjected to is justified, no questions.   To maximize my order, I always get two corns. The corn soaks up all the sauce and spices. So beautiful. So decadent. So fulfilling. Corn porn. Then I top it all off with a half dozen sausage. Because this is America and that is what the Founding Fathers would want.  Lastly, to round it all out, you gotta get some sort of heartier carb to mop up all the spicy juices. Or, else stomach acid and pure spice will fill your body to the brim. I prefer the corn fritters because I love life. However, many I know get rice.   (The below paragraph should not keep you away from this restaurant. The food is really that good. Please read until the end of the review)  Despite all this good and glory, I have only been here once and actually had my order come correct the first time around. Generally, it may take two or three urgings with the waiter/waitress to actually complete the order the way it was originally ordered. This problem isn't just found with me and my orderings, mind you. My dinner accomplices also fall victim to this situation as often. And frequently, one will see other parties in the restaurant complaining about such things as well.   If you are aware of this tendency, the overall experience is still awesome and magical bc the food is so flame. Don't let that keep you away. Just be ready for it and embrace it. Like cracking open seafood, Hot N Juicy can be difficult but it is still very rewarding.  So, in more ways than one, Hot N Juicy pushes you to the limits. They burn you emotionally and physically with their poor waitstaff and their scorching spice. However, as stated earlier, this place is love. And with love, you accept the good and the bad. Thus, I love you Hot N Juicy and will keep coming back like I always do because I don't know any better.  It would be great if you upped your game in the customer service arena tho."}
{"text":"After seeing this place on Man vs. Food and multiple pictures on my friend's Facebook page, I had to make a pit stop here while I was in Vegas.  The crawfish was good but super duper exceptionally bodaciously spicy.  You order the crawfish by the pound and it was $9.99 a pound and get to choose the seasoning sauce.  The specialty here is the hot and spicy, which you then get to choose mild, medium or hot.  Let me tell you, even if you can eat really spicy food, choose mild because it's going to so burn going in and coming out!  I can usually handle spicy food very well but found the mild here to be really hot.  The garlic in the hot and spicy sauce really came through and made the crawfish really really good!  In fact I think this place is even better than the crawfish boil restaurants that I've been to in both New Orleans and Houston.   We came here on a Thursday night and found it to be about half full which was to our surprise because we had heard it can be at least a 30-40 minute on weeknights and longer on weekends.  I guess we just lucked out.  3% discount if you pay in cash.  The total for the two of us came to $41 dollars with tax and tip; this included 2 pounds of crawfish, sweet potato fries, beer, rice and extra corn and potato.    Awesomeness is achieved here and this time man won, at least until his visit with the porcelain goddess later in the evening!"}
{"text":"Food is great.. Service is horrible !  I've been here dozens of times.  They are cutting back on service and it's definitely making it a less enjoyable experience"}
{"text":"Food was okay but not worth the wait. I tried to go in for my lunch hour and service is slow as can be considering I was only one of two tables in the place."}
{"text":"Heard of this place from many people! Finally got to try on this trip to Vegas! Awesome shrimp and crab! This place would be the bomb in Hawaii!"}
{"text":"i gave it 2 stars only because im from LA and we have Boiling Crab and Claws. 2 restaurants with the same concept, but very different flavors (in my opinion).  i get it...hot n juicy was featured on man vs food and i guess if you're ok with the spice level, its worth trying. i, on the other hand, dont like my food that spicy.  came in for dinner with a few friends and ordered shrimp and crab legs, and a few appetizers. service was ok. but the food was just...eh. maybe i'm spoiled by LA food and expect a lot more from seafood, but we're in a desert, so what more can you expect?  i didnt really enjoy the food because i expected what i get at boiling crab and claws, or maybe the hype of this place was built up so much i expected much more from it.  all in all, it definitely calms that seafood craving when i dont wanna go to a buffet and craving something with that bit of spice/extra flavor to it.  and - both times i came in it definitely didnt sit well with my stomach. same thing with my best friend. kinda left our stomachs a little \"hot n juicy\"...sorry i had to say it. thats exactly how we felt when we got home.  i'll probably back, if im really really craving cajun style seafood"}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal. Excellent, fresh seafood. Generally, I get a bucket of crab legs and a bucket of shrimp. The hot and juicy seasoning is my favorite. They also have deep fried catfish that is very good. The service is always excellent and the price is very reasonable. I would highly recommend trying this place."}
{"text":"Usually always pretty good... don't ever come in expecting to get those green mussels. They should just take them off the menu and write it up on the specials board. I've been here like 50 times and they never have them. That's the only reason they don't gets 5 from me"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the service we received from our waitress Samantha today! She knew the menu and suggested how I should get my crawfish - yummie spicy!! She was very professional and tentative even when it looked like she had numerous other tables!  WE Will definitely be going back!!  Thank you Samantha!!"}
{"text":"Very nice flavors and great service, but messy as heck.  The waitress was very helpful, polite and professional.  We had 2 lbs of shrimp, 2 lbs of crawfish, 1 lb of clams, 1 lb of snow crab, etouffe, accompanied by sausage, potatoes, rice and corn.   The hot n juicy sauce was outstanding.  The waitress warned us that we might want to order 1 spice level down, but I didn't find it too hot.  I love spicy food and the extra spicy shrimp was not overly hot.  Warning: do not wear anything you don't mind getting messy, you WILL get sauce on your clothes.  We will be back."}
{"text":"I knew I shouldn't have come here after having a early morning flight from Dulles Airport but I was convinced by my sister that it was a must have even if I was dead tired, sleepy and knowing i had to go out in the next few hours AND just got my french manicure.  We arrived by taxi which was no problem and got seated immediately.  I looked at all of the bibs and thought that this surely would make me pass out with no problem.  I did the best I could, I told our waiter that I needed cokes and any drink with caffeine.  I decided NOT to order the crawfish and went ahead and ordered the shrimp.  My sister went ahead and got the crawfish daggonit and a side of fries.    It all started really good, I felt alive,  I doubled up on my gloves and I felt like I could get past this 'tiredness' like I used to in college just push on through it.  I even got a crawfish from our 1 pound bag and thought - this is no big deal.  Handful of fries - gone. Broke off the heads of the shrimp (yes, they have the heads on) and threw them back in the bag and kept eating.  I then came up for air and then it hit - that coma, that feeling that takes over you as you realize you might have had a little too much and not only that you're 3 hours behind your NORMAL time.  Then i gave up.  To make matters even worse we walked outside and got punched in the face due to the heat.  We had a great time there and the service and food was great.  Just a note to those who did NOT rent a car and taxi their way through Vegas -- Taxi's are NOT frequent here so call ahead about 30 minutes before you leave.  4 Stars."}
{"text":"It's definitely a hit or miss here.  7 out of 10 times coming here the food is really good.  There are some of those shrimp and crawfish off season, they have really small crawfish and bad shrimps.  But more of the time it's very satisfying.  They don't do free potatoes/corns with your order per lb anymore.  It's all additional, if you want them under a dollar each.   Service was great in my opinion.  You're getting your fingers all dirty, you don't want that much service.  LOL  This last time we came in an hour before they closed.  There was no line.  The server took about 5 minutes to seat us, he was busy setting up tables.  We ordered 3 lbs of shrimp, 1 lb of crawfish, 3 corns, 3 potatoes all hot n' juicy mild and cajun fries.  I have to say, their mild is way, way to spicy for us.  We should have done the baby spice.  I don't remember if being that spicy.    Overall, we were all really satisfy.  Happy and stuffed."}
{"text":"I usually LOVE hot n juicy, but today's food was just eh. I got a pound of shrimp, with garlic butter sauce, mild heat. I like my shrimps to be fresh; not all mushy and gross. Half of my shrimp was all mushy and I definitely lost my appetite. When my shrimp came in a bag, it was very securely tied at the top with a layer of two bags; that tells me that it's been in that sauce for way too long. I was super disappointed. The waiters we had were super attentive, although one of them seemed to be in a hurry because she kept grabbing the check when we haven't paid yet and asking if the check was ready when clearly we were still eating. Very unhappy with the hot n juicy on eastern, maybe the one on spring mountain is better. I used to like hot n juicy better than boiling crab but now I'm not so sure."}
{"text":"Subpar food. Bad service. I didn't like what I got ($8) and they were unwilling to swap it out. Won't be back."}
{"text":"don't get the black mussels they taste aweful.  Everything else was mediocre.. I prefer the bay area stuff..."}
{"text":"Wayyy better than boiling crab. Just to start things off. Hot and juicy sauce is the way to go. Must try if you are into seafood. I got a pound of shrimp and snow crab. Well worth it. Believe the hype!   There was one thing, not that big of a deal but the corn didn't taste fresh and juicy like my experience with boiling crab."}
{"text":"I can never say no to crawfish :) We were in town to celebrate our three year anniversary. My brother is normally not a crawfish fan so I kinda had to drag him here and offer to pay :) but he usually goes with shrimp and blue crab. We ordered a dozen oysters to start off with. That was delicious! 1 pound shrimp, 1 pound crawfish and 1 pound blue crab later licking my fingers with burning lips ends off a good dinner. I love the lemon pepper sauce! We ordered two sides of corn and my corn was soaked in the lemon pepper sauce until the end of the meal finishing it like it wa my dessert :) I usually do not like spicy food but here I got with a medium for a kick. Which to me is spicy but probably to others is not spicy at all! I go and eat at Hot n Juicy every time I am in town. I wish they had one in Salt Lake! I probably would go everyday. lol. We did have to wait about half hour on a Friday night. All the servers help each other out which you don't see often at restaurants. They work as a team and that is amazing. There are two locations in Vegas so if you cant wait at one go to the other to see if there is a wait."}
{"text":"I recommend ordering a pound of fresh seafood and 1-2 potatoes and 1-2 corns.  I'm from New Orleans and had to try the crawfish.  Unfortunately, they were out of fresh crawfish during crawfish season.  Tried the clams.  They come with the shells, which works well for scooping up the seasoning.  I opted out of getting the gloves.  They weren't needed.  I also didn't use the bib and my shirt survived.  Extra spicy is nose running, tongue burning, eye watering hot or just about right.  The Hot n Juicy seasoning hit the spot.  I'll be bak to try the fresh crawfish."}
{"text":"The restaurant on 4810 Spring Mountain Rd. is wayyyy better than the new one on 3863 Spring Mountain Rd. What makes 4810 better you ask.....the staff is wayyy more friendly. They great you at the door and have you seated promptly, and even if it's not your waitress/waiter they all  help each other out by checking on all the tables not just the one they are assigned. The new place 3863, they kind of make you feel like you are burdening them. They also avoid eye contact when passing your table so you have to work double hard in flagging them down. The seasoning sometimes is watered down and not even hot. I feel like the one on 4810 is always on point. Hot, flavorful, and again prompt. The one at 3863 is definitely bigger/newer with all the TVs and music and nice bathroom, but I'll trade all that for the service you get at 4810. Oh, and did I mention I am from Louisiana. I've lived here now for 2yrs because of work, and enjoy a nice outing that reminds me a little of home. So, thank you Hot N Juicy on 4810. Y'all really give me that experience each time I visit."}
{"text":"I give them four stars for the service and the food. I am a very picky eater so it usually difficult for me to find something on the menu at these types of places that I actually like. I have enjoyed each meal so much that they have made me venture out to try something new each time. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because they don't take the heads off the shrimp. I asked if I could pay extra to get them cut off and the answer was no. If you don't like shrimp or don't care about the heads being attached I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Hey fun time eating out of a bag filled with juicy goodness crabs legs & shrimp and Craw fish   Outstanding Service , this party of 6 was seated promptly order explained and taken, The gentleman helping us looked like the Fighter Manny Paquiel , So we called him that,  He was okay about it and great, too bad I can't remember his name.   Thank for contacting me , the employee Marc was amazing attentive and Fun. We love his energy and attitude. When we come back we'll be looking for Marc."}
{"text":"ok so sometimes the wait is crazy long, it's worth the wait. The only restaurant that we will wait it out..the food is great..it's just awesome every time"}
{"text":"Where do I begin? I am a little lost for words for this place. Unfortunately, I wasn't a fan of Boiling Crab, so I was looking forward to an improved experience at Hot N Juicy Crawfish. Boy, was I wrong! Since I'm not a fan of peeling shrimps and breaking off the head, I decided to order calamari. I love calamari, so I was looking forward to them; specially after a four hour drive. Unfortunately, my taste buds went through an awful experience. The calamari looked pale, texture was soggy, and undercook! How in the world can you mess up something that goes in the fryer?! Second, the batter had no seasoning and it tasted plain. I was so disappointed, because I really wanted to like this place. However, our waitress was very accommodating and apologized; although, it wasn't her fault. The waitress offered to comp my food and asked if I wanted to order something different. I was very pleased with her customer service, but said no after getting something raw. I was afraid of food poisoning; specially, since I'm in Vegas.   Great customer service earned this place two stars and their fried shrimp. The fried shrimp tasted fresh and it was fried all the way. In my opinion, they serve better shrimp than Boiling Crab. As for the seasoning, it tasted the same, so don't expect to be wowed. My sister wasn't in the mood to eat seafood, so she ordered chicken nuggets with Cajun fries. The chicken nuggets are not fresh, but frozen, and they taste like they've been in their fridge for weeks. So, parents beware when you take your children to this restaurant. Also, if you're the type of person that likes to wait till everyone is served, your food will definitely get cold here. They don't bring all the entrees at the same time, but what ever comes out faster from the kitchen. I was the last one to be served, so you can only imagine how much I was looking forward to their calamari. Those of you who like different type of hot sauces for your oysters, they only carry Tabasco sauce. I wouldn't recommend this place, but you be the judge!"}
{"text":"Rustic Cajun eating at it's best!  What a great concept: Bags of boiled seafood, paper on the tables, no plates, just finger lickin!  I love it when places make it fun to eat your food.  You never have to give me any excuses to eat with your hands, I will always be there for that party.    This being said, I was not extremely impressed with the food at Hot n Juicy Crawfish.  The crawfish were frozen the nights I've been here, but they always say they usually get in fresh when they can.  The flavors were all pretty good, although I preferred the Hot-n-Juicy flavor and the cajun one was also very good.  The food came by the pound, and when we asked how much to order she told us about a pound per person.  This was way too much!  But I can never be mad at someone for suggesting a lot of food, it will all get eaten at some point, right?    The food was relatively cheap, at around $10 per pound of each type of seafood.  We got the shrimp and the crawfish, and wish I would have tried the Dungeness crab, it sounded really good.    If you're looking for a fun meal to grab with friends, definitely try out Hot n Juicy Crawfish.  But since the place was on Man v. Food, it may take you a little while to wait for your reservation, so maybe try to go during off hours."}
{"text":"I tried this place for dinner & we had mussel, shrimp & crawfish. I ordered the most spicy garlic butter for crawfish & it was so good, not extremely spicy like I expected but it was spicy to make my nose running. The service was very good with caring staffs to check on your need very often. They are awesome! Thanks guys!!"}
{"text":"We always pick out this place for enjoying crawfish & seafood rather than boiling crab. They have good selection of seafood for a reasonable price & they will come to notice us if there are just frozen things available on the menu. We got good service, good food but still the spiciness isn't that spicy like the way I expected."}
{"text":"The food was really good but the service was really bad. Our \"server\" David only took our order and did not check on us after that, not once. We had to get other servers for refills, the tab etc. and once we paid he did not even say thank you. Will not be back to this location"}
{"text":"My family went here because I love crawfish.  However, my mouth was on fire from the first bite of étouffée, even though I ordered mild bags (2 of 10).  Next time, I might not get the étouffée and order a 1 on the heat scale."}
{"text":"i wanted to try this place because i saw it on some tv shows like man vs food. hands down my favorite crawfish place ever. the spices to me were on point and the crawfish themselves lived up to the name, hot and very juicey. i live in san jose, ca where there are a few crawfish places, but this place takes the cake for me. the wait was really short too, it was packed but it only took us about 10-15 mins to be seated, which in san jose if u try to go to boiling crab can take hours! all in all, if you're ever in the vegas area and craving some crawfish definitely try this place out! i wish they were closer to where i lived =/"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to go here for months and finally managed to try it out. When we got there there was 2 parties in front of us but the worker at the front was in a really bad mood. We got seated after about 5 minutes. Server asked us what we wanted to drink about 10 minutes after being seated. He came back, took our order, and the food took about another 10-15 mins. Which wasn't bad.  However, 1) we never got bibs 2) we never got cutters for the crab, we had to ask a different server for it 3) our server didn't check up on us till we were just about done eating.  The food was okay. I should have gotten Baby Spice instead of Mild because it was hotter than I expected. Our stomachs were really upset after eating. I also noticed another person sitting near us who complained about her stomach being sore as well.  I would go back to Hot N Juicy Crawfish but maybe I'll try out the other location instead. I'm rating it 3/5 stars because the customer service was terrible."}

{"text":"Don't come here prepared to be eating a fancy meal! The tables are covered with a plastic table cloth, there is a roll of paper towels for your hands. You are given a plastic bib and gloves ( if you want them) and the food comes out in plastic bags that it has been boiled in.  My husband and I ordered 1 pound of mussels, 1 pound of shrimp, 2 pieces of corn and 4 potatoes in the Hot and Juicy mild seasoning. The seasoning was perfect amount of spice so that you could still taste and enjoy the food. The shrimp was not very flavorful and a few were mushy in texture. The mussels were amazing.  The wait staff did a good job on making sure our soda/ tea was kept full and seeing if we wanted to order anything else.  The bad... GARLIC! I walked out being able to keep vampires away for at least the next 24 hours. I enjoy  garlic but this is a little over powering. I can't imagine if I would have ordered the lemon garlic spice.  Over all... food was good but nothing spectacular. I would eat here again but won't rush back."}

Purtroppo l'aspetto negativo è che poi uscendo dal ristorante rimane sui vestiti (e non solo) una tremenda puzza di aglio...  Dopotutto però ne vale la pena!"}
{"text":"Another great time, took my 10 year old granddaughter for a birthday treat.  She had a ball.  Steamed clams are my favorite with corn added to the boil.  She had fun drinking the juice from the shells and dipping Hawaiian bread in it too."}
{"text":"We had tried the Angry Crab and decided to give this place a try.  My clams were delightful.  I tried the Hot and Juicy sauce with Baby Spice.  DELISH!!!!  The sauce was perfect on the corn and potatoes I added.  My husband had the Catfish Basket and sweet potato fries.  Gone! This place offers bibs AND GLOVES and yes you need them.  Some of my clams did not open so they did another order.  Two Dos Equis and I am a happy clam!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is sooo GOOD!  I was HOOKED after a friend took me here last year.  I ordered a pound of shrimp marinated in the Hot n Juicy special.  I love eating really really spicy foods and the medium spiciness I ordered had just enough kick for me.  My friends ordered crab legs and crawfish marinated in the Hot n Juicy special but I think the shrimp is able to soak more of the delicious marinade and easier to peel.  Heck, I even ate the shrimp's head and I don't normally eat the shrimp's head =)  The marinade is that good!  I'll never be able to go back to Hawaii and eat expensive Giovanni's or any other shrimp trucks again.  Giovanni who?  I can't wait to go back to Vegas and eat there again!"}
{"text":"This was a good pick! I had the snow legs, a half pound of shrimp,  1 potato and 1 corn. I would expect potatoes and corn to come with all the boils, but no, they are extra and charged per piece. The hot and hooky juicy flavor is a blend of all the flavors. The medium spice level was quite hot. The shrimp were large and cooked well. The crab legs were also a good size. They provided lemon, but you have to purchase dipping butter. This dinner is messy, so dress accordingly!"}
{"text":"Eat here yesterday for lunch. I had the lemon pepper spicy crawfish and my boo had the catfish basket the food was amazing as usual however we didn't have the best server we asked for gloves 4 times before she brought them. It wasn't that busy. I go only for the food though. I recommend it to anyone who loves seafood and doesn't mind getting messy"}
{"text":"My sister in law brought this home. Very delicious. We had the mild and spicy crawfish and shrimp. The shrimp are huge, and we loved the taste and amount.  The crawfish is an acquired taste. I was not a fan, but the rest of my family enjoyed the crawfish.    I would definitely eat this food again. Cajun fries super spicy- too spicy for me. But great if you love the heat."}
{"text":"We lived in Vegas for a couple years and would always hit this deliciousness at least once a month. Once we moved out of town we have tried to find a place like it and nothing ever compares! We came here tonight as we were visiting and had the \"Get your feet wet\" (crawfish, shrimp, corn and potatoes) and it did not disappoint! Great flavor with the perfect amount of spice! Service was awesome and quick as well. We had our food within minutes. We left with our bellies happily full, but after 10 min I had noticed that I forgot my watch on the table, so when I went back to get it, the guy ask what we had eaten and he literally stuck on some gloves and went digging into the big trash bin until he found my watch! So nice of him to do that for me! We will come back next time we are visiting Vegas not only because of the AMAZING food, but also the exceptional service!"}
{"text":"Wow never going to eat at any other sea food place again. I've heard about this place and had it on my list of things to do for a while now and regret not coming here sooner. Let's start from the moment I walked in. Well I walked in and it was a tad busy I got seated in another section on the right side of the building. I had an AMAZING SERVER her name was McKenna (insanely attractive ). Expected the normal type of customer service ya know? But no she blew it out of the water! She got my order and the food came out pretty quick. She kept checking on me making sure everything was perfect just like her. Kept checking up on me and even made sure I never ran out of the little things like more condiments such as sauces and lemons (which I need a lot of for my water). The manager (Maggie) also came up a few times and we had a great talk while she was making sure everything was to my liking and that I was enjoying myself. This staff is pretty amazing even the other servers would check up on me (Haley), would check up on me often it's like I never not had someone checking up on me. I felt like a celebrity. This location prides themselves in customer service and making sure everything is to your liking, you can tell by the way they make you the top priority on their list of things to do. THIS IS A MUST!! If you love sea food with some entertainment from sports, great background music and amazing customer service well this is the place to go!!"}
{"text":"That Hot N Juicy seasoning, though... ERMAHGERD, I can't get enough. I put it on everything.  The food is always so good and the staff is super friendly. I went with a group of five last time and we started with a pound per person and added on as needed - it comes out fairly quickly so you're not left waiting too long. ALSO - we had a variety of \"spice tolerance\" at our table ranging from \"I think ketchup is spicy\" to \"bring the heat, baby!\" and everyone ended up happy sharing EVERYTHING. Our waitress was really helpful - and they always are - to make sure everyone got what they wanted (secret - if you want it spicier, get extra sauce on the side!)  Being a desert dweller, seafood is kind of foreign... I always expect it to be super expensive and not be satisfied with the portions. That's not the case here. For what you get, the prices are VERY reasonable and I always have to roll myself on out of there after I've finished gorging."}
{"text":"My husband had eaten here the last time he was in Vegas so he wanted to take our group this time.   My husband had raved about the service on his last visit. This time, the service was ok. They weren't very busy but my drink still went a long time before it was refilled.   My husband ordered the crawfish, my cousin and I the shrimp and other cousin the fried catfish. Each item was really good. The shrimp aren't unshelled so you really have to work for them. Their sauce (we got the garlic butter) is delicious. It's VERY messy - thank goodness for the bibs. I had to scrub down my arms and hands in the bathroom after the meal - it gets everywhere.   The fried catfish was also delicious! I think I almost liked more than the shrimp.   Overall, well definitely be back."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place. They seafood is always delicious. I can complain that it's always extremely busy but I believe it's well worth the wait. Would definitely recommend to friends."}
{"text":"So I saw this place on the Man vs. Food so I had to try it when I went to Vegas with my Family. The place was cute. Lots of pictures of past customers. Some familiar faces on the wall. We ordered the crawfish and King crab.. The flavor was mediocre.. like many of the other crawfish restaurants I've been to but the king crab was delicious. A little over price though."}
{"text":"After waiting for an order they wrote down wrong, 2 pounds of snow crab - baby spice (they gave us 2 pounds of shrimp) the order came in medium not baby spice. Most of the people in our group were finished eating an hour ago."}
{"text":"I was just at Hot N Juicy with my girlfriend and her mother earlier today. This is one of my girlfriend's mom's favorite restaurants, however, today just seemed to be off. It was my first experience at this restaurant and things couldn't have been worse. To start off, the waitress (who was training someone new, yikes) only was at our table to take our order. After that, she never returned. On top of that, the food took over an hour to come out. Two tables that sat down after we ordered got their food before us. The manager came out and informed us that they lost the ticket. Okay, that could be forgiven and understood had their been some sort of communication from the waitress (had she bothered to check on us). Then, the story changed. The lost ticket never printed and it was a computer malfunction. Working in the industry, my girlfriend and I both knew immediately that the drastic change in the story meant the waitress never rang in the order!! We were offered a 25% discount and a $20 credit for our next visit. Truly, I would give 0 stars for the horrendous service. The two stars is for the food. It was delicious and flavorful as expected but it wasn't enough to get the bad taste of lousy service and management out of our mouths."}
{"text":"Being from Southern California where the king of crawfish restaurant resides, The Boiling Crab, it's hard to find another place that can dethrone it. But my wife and I had to give Hot and Juicy Crawfish a try after seeing it on one of our favorite shows, Man vs Food.  The food looked absolutely delicious on the show, everything that my wife and I come to expect from this type of restaurant.  We had a basketball tournament in Vegas this past weekend and made sure we made time to head over to Hot and Juicy.  Made it there on Friday afternoon around 1:30pm. I was happy to see that it wasn't so busy and were able to get seated right away. At Boiling Crab, the average wait time is an hour.  We ordered the following: one pound of crawfish, two pounds of shrimp and five corns all in the special Hot and Juicy sauce medium spicy.  The sauce itself was not bad. It's doable but it does not compare to Boiling Crab's shabang sauce.  The shabang sauce is love at first bite.   The crawfish was not bad but the shrimp and corn were not very good. The body of the shrimp was fine but the shrimp heads was dry. No juice/brains to enjoy sucking on and the corn was very rubbery, sort of like eating candy corn.  My wife and I shared one corn and left 4 uneaten. Normally, we could eat three each.  For those who have not tried Boiling Crab, you might find Hot and Juicy Crawfish a good place to eat.  But for those who have dined at Boiling Crab, you will be disappointed.    I will be sending Adam Richman (host of Man vs Food) an email of my review and a recommendation that if he is ever in Orange County California, to stop by Boiling Crab and see what he thinks."}
{"text":"Food is always tasty and nice here but staffs are not friendly.  Even on the phone. When i go pick up my food theyre busy talking by themselves"}
{"text":"They charged $12.99/lb for fresh crawfish, but base on what I got, the crawfish are not fresh at all.  Very disappointed for what I paid for."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing.  I started it off with a couple of beers and the catfish nuggets.   I got the pound of crawfish the hottest level and devoured it all. Our server was amazed!  Soaked the rest of the catfish nuggets with the Hell Blazing crawfish juice to finish it off.  Despite the 3 blisters on my lip I obtained from my meal this place is amazing. I cannot wait to go back !!!"}
{"text":"First timer, Gotta say the food was excellent. The shrimps were of good size, spices were just right."}
{"text":"What the hell is this sh*t?  First off, this crawfish place goes off of market prices so they are subject to change (the prices are on a separate menu).   I ordered 1 lb of crawfish, 1/2 lb of shrimp, and 1/2 sausages (6 pcs).   You can choose the level of spice which goes from baby spice to extra spicy.  I myself opted for Hot N Juicy Special(mix of Cajun, garlic, lemon pepper, Louisiana) in mild and should have heeded the warning from my buddies about the inconsistent heat levels.  Whoever is in the back mixing the seasoning needs to be re-trained.  My shrimp came out very spicy and my crawfish came out blazing and painfully hot.  By the time I finished, my eyes were watering and I was sniffling up and down.  Even my friend's \"baby spice\" was pretty hot.  The crawfish tasted like rubber!  I found out it was because it was frozen (wth right?)!  The shrimp and sausage were also very, MEH.  My buddy ordered Clams and Mussels, 1 lb each.  They left hungry!  I would avoid this since the weight of the shells really put a damper on how much food you actually get.  The service here was horrid at best.  They forgot to put the sausages/corn/potatoes in the bag.  They didn't know what we ordered and mixed up the 1/2 pound things with the pound things.  The food inconsistently came out, it was a good amount of time until we all got our food.  They even forgot the things we ordered and we had to do a recap at the end with the waitress when asking for our check.  Once we finally got our checks, is it weird to have \"tap water\" as one of the things on the check?  Damn, never again.      This is the most rubbish Cajun crawfish and shrimp I've ever eaten and the only saving grace is that, this is the only restaurant of it's type in the area.  Otherwise I would have definitely given it 1 star.  Aw, you poor people of Tempe, Arizona, you guys are totally being gyped of what could be great. *Sigh*"}
{"text":"Great little place.  Worth the trek off the strip.  Remember to get some extra potatoes, corn and sausage as they don't come with the crawfish."}
{"text":"No matter what Boiling Crab & Hot and Juicy will always be compared to each other! Their menus & concepts are practically identical yet the 2 are quite different~   Atmosphere: I prefer BC! The restaurant is huge with plenty of TVs and I love how you can tag up their walls ~  Service: BC wins! Their servers are always smiley & happy! I love how they put your bibs on for you~  Quality: I think it's a tie! Both places have always had fresh seafood! Yummmmmy! And they usually have the same prices~   Corn/Potatoes/Sausage: For some reason they taste better at BC.. they just do!   Special Sauce: I prefer the Hot & Juicy special sauce over the whole shabang! It has a stronger deeper flavor and you can definitely taste the garlic! BC can sometimes be way too salty for me..  Overall, The Boiling Crab wins but not by that much! I still like to eat at both places ~"}
{"text":"I am a hot & juicy fan.. Even before it was on the travel channel and became so widely popular. I have preached the wonders of shrimp and crawfish to all my friends and will even choose H&J over The BoilingCrab. I have had many wonderful dinners at the original location and the servers are always so attentive. So why the low rating for this new location you ask? Its not the food that lacks at this location, it's the service.   We tried out this place on a Thursday night around 9:00.. It wasn't too busy so when we arrived the hostess sat us right after she cleared up a booth. After a while a not so enthusiastic nor friendly server took our drink order. Then when she came back we ordered 2 lbs of shrimp + potatoes, rice, rolls and sweet potato fries.   Slowly our order started to arrive one by one delivered by a food runner.. Soon we received everything except the sweet potato fries. Over half way through our dinner still no fries.. And no sign of our server.. So we have to flag someone down & ask and we find out that they ran out of SP fries a while a go and our server was supposed to tell us.. Then we are told not to worry it will immediately be taken off our check..  At this point our server has yet to once check up on us.. I spot her bottle blonde pig tails numerous times chit chatting with her co workers and horsing around..   Then we have to flag someone down again to place a Togo order but then we're told the kitchen is closed...    Finally our server shows up only to plop a checkbook down on the table.. Peeved, we want to leave so we give her our card., when it comes back we realize they didn't take off the fries after all.. So we go to the front and the girl apologizes and says she needs to swipe the card again but we should be rest assured it will only be charged once because they settle all the transactions at the end of the night. So there goes another 5 minutes of waiting around due to bad service all the while food is still being brought out to tables.. \"kitchen closed\" my a$$..   ..The next day sure enough the card got charged twice from hot and juicy.   Now I'm sorry, I honestly don't mean to be rude and I am a pretty patient person but seriously how hard is it to be a server at a restaurant that only has plastic silverware, paper towels and serves their food from a plastic bag.. ? Had the server just done her job adequately my experience would have been great."}
{"text":"Been meaning to visit here when I'm in town on business, and finally was able to come here the other night. Thanks to yelpers, I now have another great place to add to my list.  This was not only a great place to grab some food, but reasonably priced with very friendly servers and a fun experience. Just make sure you don't have any paper cuts because you will be using your hands! And if you get some of the spicy seasoning, then beware!  They do provide you with a bib, which I needed. Actually, I needed two since I ripped the first one and it became unusable. Fail on my part. Coupled with the plastic on the table and the paper towels, you do not wear your Sunday best here, unless you'd like it covered in their delicious sauces.  I had the shrimp, calamari, and a bowl of rice. Wanted to try the crawfish but I had a craving for shrimp. Maybe next time, I come to Vegas often!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing but I am giving this only 1 star because the terrible service from the lead Eric! Yes, the lead. There are hundreds of other restaurants in Las Vegas with amazing food and amazing service so you don't need to settle."}
{"text":"Previous experience terrible!  However; the manager contacted me and invited me back. This time  my food was great and the waitress was wonderful!  Very glad to have had a positive experience."}
{"text":"We decided to stop here on our way home to California and boy are we glad we did. Our server Rene was awesome and because it was our first time he helped us decide what to order. We had the lobster, snow crab legs, and shrimp with the hot and juicy mild sauce. Not only was the flavor amazing but the atmosphere was fun. A neat little place with great food and service. Thank you again!"}
{"text":"Hit n miss. When it's a hit, I wanna come back.   When its not, it takes awhile before i come back.   I love it when the sauce hot n juicy mild is thick and not watery, when the shrimp is not overcooked and mushy and when the crawfish is live."}
{"text":"Hate to rate sooo low but honestly, if there was a choice to put zero stars, I would.  Went today...craving crawfish...was told because crawfish out of season, they had only frozen or live brown crawfish.  I never had either so I asked the waiter to give me a suggestion.  She shrugged and said many customers take the frozen.    Decided 1 lb of frozen and 1 lb of brown....this was the worst food I have ever tasted!!!!!!!!   So I told waiter to take back the frozen (only ate 2 pieces) because it was nasty and give me a lb of shrimp instead.  Shrimp sucked too!  and worst of all, i got charged 6.99 for the two pieces of crawfish I ate, which I almost gagged on.  So, I gave zero tip!  For those of you trying to compare Boiling Crab to Hot N Juicy, my suggestion, wait for BC to open up here.  Should be soon.  I live in Las Vegas and am telling you to SAVE YOUR $$$$$"}
{"text":"I realized when I walked into the restaurant last night to meet my friend for dinner that I've actually only been to HNJ once before, and at least 4 years ago at the old location.  I also realized that it was then that I first had this type of food but honestly I don't remember that experience at all.  This time however, I'm sure I'll remember as it was AWESOME!  This location is cute with brick walls and booths, as well as tables that aren't squished together.  There are a number of flat screens along the walls but I honestly didn't even notice them.  We got a booth right away and our server was great.  She brought our waters, answered all our questions, and took our orders and it was all seamless.    We ordered a pound of shrimp, clams, 1/2 dozen sausage, 2 corns and some potatoes.  Everything came out within 15 minutes.  We were really impressed by the size of both the shrimp and the clams.  The clams were nice and plump and cooked perfectly.  They weren't rubbery at all, quite the opposite.  Also, the shrimp were cooked perfectly as well, which I was really happy about because both the last times I went to Boiling Crab, the shrimp were over cooked and tough.  I also found myself loving the HNJ sauce more than the \"Whole Shebang\" at BC.  It was much more flavorful and not as thick so it coated all the seafood evenly.  Everything was served really hot so you never felt like you were eating cold seafood.  Our server constantly refilled our waters and was really friendly. After being a BC fan for this long, I'm totally switching teams.  Team HNJ all the way!"}
{"text":"Brought my daughter here for the first time and right after our meal she was already asking me to bring her here next time. Crab is amazing. Service is great too!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious. Messy, but delicious. Great place to eat some seafood and take the family. Wouldn't on a first date though, too messy!"}
{"text":"This restaurant looks like it's nothing special from the building but when you get inside it's pretty clean.  The wait wasn't too long when I went there for four people and they sat us right away.  The sauce that comes with the seafood was not too bad.  It was not as thick as the sauce from another Cajun joint in California, Boiling Crab.  It depends on how you like your sauce, I guess.  1 star for being away from all the touristy spots and near all the Asian stores! 1 star for free water 1 star just for being featured on the Food channel  -1 star for forgetting my rice -1 star for taking 20 minutes longer after I already addressed the waiter that I didn't get my rice  *tip* If you get dropped off by a cab you need to call one to get picked up because taxis do not come by this area of Vegas."}
{"text":"First time in this location... Service was very sloow, the sauce on the pound of shrimp and crab legs we ordered was weak hot n juicy sauce on spring mtn. Was on point as in it covered the shrimp. The bag that they served was over boiled and flavor was not in it. I don't know if I will come back to this place. The fact that I had to ask for the stuff we order several times was just plain annoying."}
{"text":"Haven't need to this location since they opened. However came back to get a good fixin of Shrimp and Crawfish.   Love the place, the food, the location.   On this occasion we were served by Jessica A.  and she is like the very best server in all of their restaurants.  Come here and ask to be seated at Jessica A's table!"}
{"text":"This place is a must!!!!!  However, go to Costco or Sams Club first to get a huge package of gum and mints.  You will be keeping all vampires and trampires (K-Stew) away for at least a few days......  1 Ambiance - 4 star - for an asian strip mall, where you expect nothing, you get a nice, large place, high ceilings, decent decor, room to wait and plenty of table and chairs. You are in a busy area, so parking is easy / not easy.  It is crowded.  2.  Service - 5 star - Everyone here is young and very pleasant. I think that people here enjoy working here, enjoy explaining the in and out of what to do and how to order. I really enjoy the staff here.   3  Food - 5 star - Wow, amazing, tasty and an experience that adds to the overall feeling.  a.  Shrimp - Large, tender, juicy, filling, easy to peel. b.  Crawfish - Well, they are crawfish, eat the tail only, a small bit of meat and tasty, just a lot of work to get to the tiny morsel of meat... c.  They have plenty of other choices, blue crab, snow crab, dungeness, lobster, mussels and more.  I just stuck to shrimp and crawfish. d.  Sauces - We try the Lemon Pepper and the Hot Juicy in mild and medium. Yummy and not too hot.   e.  Quantity - Easy to order more, generally 1 lb of shrimp per person at least and 2 lb of crawfish per person.  you get a potato and corn with 2 lb order of the crawfish!  Doesn't seem like enticing, however, when you are burning calories just to eat, to chow down on a marinated corn or potato is nice and different.  4.  Price - All are market price, however, for three of us eating about 7 - 8 lb of food, I generally spend about 30.00 per person, which is a good deal for seafood.    5.  Toilets - OK, this place must be owned by an asian person because the toilets need to be modernized or cleaned...  Hey, we are going here for the toilets though......  GK says, great place.  Check it out."}
{"text":"I personally believe Hot N Juicy deserves a higher rating on Yelp. I have eaten at many similar places in Northern California, such as Kickin Crab, Boiling Crab, & Crawdaddy. Even though the quality of Hot N Juicy is not on the same caliber, it is a good alternative for AZ.   We ordered the Hot N Juicy sauce with medium spice. I can't really eat spicy, but medium was surprisingly the right amount of heat. The sauce was flavorful, but very salty as expected for these types of food. I think a tad more garlic would have been perfect. For the two of us, we had 1 lb of black mussels, clams, and shrimps in addition to 2 corns. It was unfortunate that they ran out of green mussels, and only had frozen crawfish. I highly recommend not getting the frozen crawfish. It's worth waiting for fresh crawfish - yes, there's a big difference. The cajun fries were bomb - super crispy. Towards the end, I started to have a running nose as the spice finally caught up to me. The food tastes a lot better than Angry Crab. The clams were also significantly larger. However, I like the ambiance from Angry Crab a little more than Hot N Juicy.   There's plenty seating with TVs all around. We went on a Monday night, so service was great. They provided us with gloves, so our hands wouldn't get super sticky and smelly afterwards. They could improve on actively refilling our water. It would also be nice to have buckets at the table to toss our garbage, which will certainly leave more table space. I was running out of room.   I had an enjoyable experience and will definitely return for more."}
{"text":"10 TIMES BETTER THAN ANGRY CRAP  Let me tell you how much I love this place !!!  This is what I ordered.  Drink- Shirley temple  Oysters - juicy, clean , and extremely fresh  Mozzarella sticks - cooked to perfect and gooey in the middle  Soft shell crab basket with Cajun fries - great if you are getting boiled food  Boiled food- 4 pounds of live or frozen crawfish just because I don't taste that much of a difference and frozen is always easier and bigger to pull out . I got that Hot n Juicy flavor , you won't get full off of this only so you will need some more boiled food  1 pound of their king crab is to die for . 1 1/2 to two legs is about a pound but it's a lot of legs let me tell you!! I get that lemon pepper . Everything here is amazing and the service here is incredible. SELENA our waitress was extremely attentive to our needs and the manager EMILY was going around everyone's table to make sure everything was amazing. If it has a line and wait in front of it , you know it's delicious! Will be coming here more often."}
{"text":"This is the third or so Crawfish restaurant I've been to. I've come to the realization that the effort required to enjoy these puppies is not worth it for me. :|   The seasoning of the crawfish was nice (hot 'n juicy), although I enjoyed eating the shrimp more... maybe because there's more meat in the shrimp!?   The restaurant got pretty busy, and I can easily see a wait being possible. If you head in around 6 or so, you shouldn't have a problem getting a table."}
{"text":"5 star service! Brandon is the best! It was our first time in and Brandon took a ton of time with us, to help navigate thru the menu and pick the right options. His suggestion on the flavors were spot on! Also he took the time to get to know us and was very friendly and completely knowledgeable not only about the menu but about the history of the company as a whole.  He even took the time to show us how to properly crack and peel our shrimp and crawfish. Side note: he makes a MEAN long island iced tea!   My only complaint is that the fried shrimp was soooooo salty and I couldn't really eat it (I'm not sensitive to salt at all, so that's saying something)."}
{"text":"Renee, Janelle & Nick we're exceptional in service and the food was great! We got the shrimp, crawfish and mussels, hot, juicy & spicy! Bonus: great music & happy hour starts at 11AM!"}
{"text":"I can not recommend the clams, and it's not because they were bad.  I guess everything gets served out of plastic bags here,  that's their thing. What is really horrible is getting a bag clams in your favorite broth, instead of being served in a bowl, and then literally 4 out of every 5 shells comes out of the bag with no clam in it.  We had to go through the whole bag until the end result which was a small group of clam bodies sitting in the broth. Yes,  we did ask for bowls and they don't have anything to offer.  Worst seafood experience ever, see my picture."}
{"text":"The extra spicy shrimp was delicious!!! I will definitely be back. My only complaint is they have no wine and no beer on draft."}
{"text":"Great food but terrible parking. I called in a To-go order and spent 20minutes circling attempting to find parking. I love the food and will go back but if you think you're going to quickly get in and out you might be disappointed."}
{"text":"I've heard a lot about this place so we tried it out! The service was good and the people that work there are really nice. However! The food wasn't all that to me! The shrimp was fair but I was highly disappointed in the quality of my crab legs!!! Very poor quality!  It was just a waste of time and money! I do not recommend this place. The hot n juicy sause was good though! Giving 2 stars because the service was great!"}
{"text":"I was always a fan of the HNJ chain in California, but tonight was just not their night to be representing their chain.  Tonight was my brother's 24th birthday and I already called in advance that a group was coming in to dine in. Our waiter, who I will hold the name from this review, took our orders, served us water, and left his shift giving it to another young man who took over the table. Granted, I knew it was about 70 mins from Last Call and we were a big group, you would assume attention to detail is most important.  First we order appetizers, which were mediocre at best (the calamari breading was too salty and saturated from the deep fryer oil). Next, the orders of clams came out and within the first two clams I ate, I felt like I almost split my teeth because I bite gritty sediment in my food. Seafood should've been washed properly and rid of the rocks and grits of the clam. I had to send it back. By now, my appetite has faded because of the quality of the food I expected from such a reputable chain. As everyone one around me got their food, multiple bus boys/girls brought food out to the table. Unknowingly more people came to join our party, the late comers who ordered food after my brother and I received their food first. Granted, most of us ordered similar dishes, it should have been the staff's responsibility to figure out who's food went to who. I ended up not getting my 2lbs of shrimp with potatoes and corn, sending back a pound of clams, and not even enjoying my appetizer.  When the checks came back, none of the orders were organized in the way we set it with the first waiter to left serving us. I almost feel bad, which is why I'm donating a half star to the review, for the new waiter because he got bombarded with complaints from our table. Beers from one side of the table were charged to the other side of the table's tab, and one of my friends ended up paying $95 when he barely at half a bag of shrimp. It is just ridiculous, and what made it worse is that it was closing time, so pressure to get up and leave was felt. I've worked in the restaurant business and I know how staff get when the last few customers don't leave.  The only reason why I'm donating another half star to give this review of Tempe's Hot & Juicy a whopping 1 star review, is because he gave us a free pound of shrimp 'on the house' from the kitchen. I honestly don't know what is wrong with this chain but from what I remember at my experience in Cali's HNJ, it was a night and day. I'm leaving this review still upset and disappointed at the professionalism of the staff and food quality tonight."}
{"text":"Well worth the cab ride into Chinatown to try.  Crawfish was very fresh as was the softshell crab.  Next time, must plan a day trip to Chinatown and finish off with Hot N Juicy.  Beware that for most people, the extra spicy may be too spicy; would recommend starting off with the mild or medium.  Order one lbs first and go from there.  And don't ware anything you would mind getting juiced.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I've dined here three times so I know the drill.  1. Skip the crawfish and go for the shrimp. Crawfish is way too much work for that tiny piece of meat! I've had the crab legs as well and didn't think they were worth the price. 2. Order Hot n Juicy sauce mild or medium. The mild used to be pretty spicy but last time I was there, it wasn't as hot. Did they change their ratio of seasonings? 3. The catfish is the bomb.com! The cornbread coating was crispy and not oily at all. 4. It gets messy but that's part of the experience. They even give you a cute little bib.  What really impressed me was my server the last time I was there. I forget her name but she was such a sweetheart. She took the time to explain the menu to my friends and she was very patient. Keep up the good work guys."}
{"text":"We were really excited for a new Hot N Juicy closer to our house.  We've been to the other 2 locations in Vegas and loved them.  So, we had high hopes for the new one on Eastern.  The décor looks fantastic, they basically gutted the whole space and it's very modern looking.  Comfortable seating and lots of it.  Quite an upgrade from the previous tenant.  We had dinner around 7:15 on a Tuesday and it was about 3/4 full.  We were seated immediately and a server greeted us within 3 minutes.  Our drinks came out very quickly.  So far so good.......  After this, the wheels kind of fell off.  My wife ordered a half pound of the steamed shrimp with garlic butter.  I decided I didn't want to get super messy, so I got fried shrimp with French fries.  I've had Hot N Juicy's fried shrimp before and loved it, so I didn't think it was going to be an issue.  Well, after about 7 minutes my wife's shrimp was at the table.  I then waited............and waited.  My wife was put in the position of eating her shrimp alone or waiting until my food arrived and then eating a cold dinner.  During this period, while we waited, the waitress basically ignored us.  I think she could tell how angry I was.  25 minutes after my wife's food arrived, I spoke with a supervisor.  She was nice about it, apologized that they were short staffed.  The fries then came out after about 30 minutes.  My shrimp didn't come out until nearly 35 minutes after my wife's food arrived.  This was approximately 40-45 minutes after I ordered.  So, that kind of turned us off to the whole meal.  It may be that my opinion was colored by the experience, but I also thought the food wasn't as good as the Spring Mountain locations.  The breading on the fried shrimp was thicker than last time I had it.  The Cajun fries were good however.    They handled it well, we were only charged for the steamed shrimp in the bag.  The supervisor and our server were apologetic, but like I said, the meal was pretty much ruined.  I think we'll probably give this location another shot, but so far they seem to be having some issues."}
{"text":"I first went to HNJ on a Saturday afternoon.  Although it was crowded, we got right in with no wait.  We each had a pound of crawfish with the special, which is the mix of the various flavors.  We also got it on the \"medium hot\" side.  I like stuff hot, but I have heard they can really put the heat on, so I was a little concerned about ordering it straight up hot.  We also got some fried shrimp with french fries to share.  The crawfish is delicious, but you have to WORK to get them.  They have so little meat, I would recommend shelling quite a few before eating.  In subsequent trips, my wife has had the shrimp, which are of course much larger.  They have a much better pay off, but don't have the delicious heads to suck out like the crawfish do.  I was surprised by how good the fried shrimp was.  It's probably the best I have had in the valley.  The coating was crunchy, but not overly thick or greasy.  And, they are large.  This was surprising and certainly welcome.    All in all, HNJ lives up to its considerable hype after being featured on so many TV shows.  Give it a shot."}
{"text":"Love this simple yet fabulous concept of Hot N Juicy! Not a fancy establishment but clean. Tables are covered in plastic wrap for easy clean up and I love that they issue a bib and plastic see thru gloves for easy handling of the food.    Dress is casual and staff is friendly.   When ordering you pick your:  1. specific seafood such as shrimp, mussels, crab or any combination  2. spiciness level from mild to super hot 3. then you pick your seasoning (ranges from garlic butter, old Bays etc)   I always order a half pound of shrimp (they are huge) and they have the head on them, 2 pieces of corn in garlic butter and Hawaiian rolls. The shrimp tastes so fresh and is very filling and satisfying! The shrimp are very easy to peel.  My mouth waters every time that I tell someone about this place!  I wish we had them at home In NC!  Be sure to check them Out!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing. It was very tasty and ahh first time getting crab legs and it was really good! Our server was really nice and got us extra sauce."}
{"text":"Great food and deedee provided great service!! This is not my first time here, I recommend it to everyone I know. The music was enjoyable and the atmosphere was friendly."}
{"text":"The girls their were super nice and friendly!!!They get 3 stars by themselves!!!The food was just ok.It reminds me of the boiling crab.Yes will go again."}
{"text":"When I first heard that the place was opening in AZ, I wasnt as excited as my fellow foodies since the Vegas location was not so impressive.   However, that all changed after I took my first bite into their \"Hot and Juicy\" seasoned seafood. I shared a lb of clams, sausage, shrimp, and corn. This place is DEFINITELY better than the Vegas location and will happily refer anyone here.   After all is said and done, I still have to give a 3. I hate to give 3 stars if the food was perfect but you must understand that service is just as important as the food itself. We were told that it was a 30 minute wait but it turned out to be a 2 hour wait. I dont mind the waiting but setting realistic time frames are important.   Another issue we had was getting the incorrect order... 3 times... each 15 minutes apart... all 3 times with 3 different servers. With the 30+ staff members on board that night, it might be a good idea to designate servers to specific areas so we dont have to repeat our order so many times... Felt like a bad game of telephone and was surprised that we werent served a purple monkey dishwasher.   I can tell the servers were just as frustrated and without direction when someone dumped sprite into my water cup. I politely told her I didnt want sprite in my water cup but she smiled and walked off.   Although I dont plan on eating here anytime soon, thats not to say that I wont call in for carry out. I will give them a few more months to work out the kinks before I go again but great job for getting the flavor right the first time around and beating out your Vegas counterparts"}
{"text":"This place is the best! People will argue that boiling crab is better but the seasoning and the sausage here just can't be beat! We love getting the shrimp and crawfish with sausages and rice. a lot of rice. You need a whole lot to soak up all that delicious sauce. Get the hot n juicy special seasoning if you don't mind having garlic breath, if you don't want that the juicy Cajun is just as good. The mild is usually spicy enough so watch out if your not big on hot food. I love having those plastic bibs on and eating with my hands. Prices aren't bad at all. I think it's about $12/lbs for shrimp. Whenever we come we're seated right away. The servers are always friendly and the food comes out pretty fast. I would suggest coming here in clothes that's ready to go in the laundry coz it will end up smelling like garlic lol so leave your coats and jackets in the car!"}
{"text":"An awesome time.  My lady and I came in unexpected. She's always wanted to try this place, but I've always been trying to avoid it. At least, the one on spring mountain. I just don't like leaving a food place, smelling like the food for the next week or so.  This location, totally different.  We ordered the feast. Crab, crawfish, shrimp, potatoes, corn, and sausages. The works.  We got mild spice and the hot n juicy flavoring.  It also came with Cajun calamari.  Everything was awesome.  Honestly, we could've eaten more. That's how good.  We got to a good level of full.  This meal states it's good for 4 people, but if you haven't eaten all day, I'd say 1-2 people. I probably could've eaten it by myself.  The servers were kind. We sat at the booth near the door, and we had no complaints. It was like our own little spot, away from the loud people on the inside.  Food. Awesome. Service. Great. Five stars all the way."}
{"text":"Easily craving crawfish, especially since the Husband missed out the last two times I went.  Went last Sunday and the place is packed!  Dang, it's getting busy in there and it's only going to get busier!    Started off with two pounds of crawfish ($10.99/lb) of their Hot N Juicy Special seasoning with medium heat.  Easy to peel shells, juicy and flavorful crawfish, what's there not to love?  Inquired about the Dungeness crab, $17.99/lb.  They gave us a 1.7-pounder and it arrived whole in a bag.  Started off with the back legs and moved up to the claws.  The meat was sweet and the crab was fresh.  Deciding on how to move about the body, broke the head off and it was crab head heaven.  Loads and loads of crab fat/head etc. and so bad for our cholesterol!  But it was so good, really good.  We were scooping that stuff up and dipping it into the sauce.  Yum yum!   Finally moving onto the body, broke it in half and dug into the lump meat.  Really sweet meat and just good stuff.  Nice treat from having only crawfish.  They did a last call as we were chowing on the crab, which was fine for us at the time.  Come to today, a few hours earlier, the Husband looks at me and says \"I want to go back for more crawfish.\"  I realize that because we ordered only two pounds the other day, we just teased ourselves.  (We're used to two pounds each.)  Then my brother calls and asks for the address of this place.  Is he in town...no, this weekend he will be with his boys.  Uh, if you're gonna go, we'll probably want to go with you too so let us know...  Yeah, we like it that much.  Our cholesterol numbers aren't looking too good at this point."}
{"text":"Walked in and was not greeted by hostess who was already grabbing menus to seat someone else. He looked right at me and didn't bother to say hello and continued to walk away. I was greeted immediately after with another guy who sat us down and got our waters. We got our food out pretty quick, ordered wings which our my favorite.  Normally you automatically get bibs and I did not get that. Everyone around me had bibs. You k ow hot n juicy is messy. Eating our shrimp it was under cooked slightly. It did come out pretty quick which is a first. Unfortunately we did have to send back our shrimp for being undercooked. I would hate to get sick.   The waiter did take it back and offered to get us a fresh new batch.  He also came back and offered us  some free beers on the house. Most places would just apologizes and give you a Comp or dessert.   Overall our shrimp came back over cooked but it was still a average experience"}
{"text":"So, I can to Vegas for vacation, like many. When I was told there was a crawfish join in town, I knew I had to visit the place. So I was super excited to have some awesome shrimp and crawfish with the amazing seasoning and spice. Let's get started:  The Food Everything was delicious and quite satisfying. A friend and I shared the \"Get Your Feet Wet\" combo and that was perfect! We also had to order the cajun fries. Cajun fries were okay. I wish they had extra Cajun spice to it. Also, I like my Cajun fries with ketchup mayo and they were accommodating with no charge; where other places have charged me for that request.   The Service The servers were pretty normal. Nothing too exciting. My colleagues had stated they wish the server would check in with us more often.   Overall, if you craving some crawfish...here is the place to go."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Always come here for the shrimp. I love the service, everyone is always so friendly and kind. Never had an order messed up. Yes, I have had where servers take forever to refill our drinks but other than that this is the place. I believe everyone should try this place once, believe me you'll get hooked. I always recommend! My husband gets mad cause I always crave this. Update: amazing service today!!! Josh was our server of a party of 18 and boy was he always attentive and always with a smile! Josh if you're reading this you were awesome definitely going to ask to be seated in your area again."}
{"text":"Delicious! Just too good to pass on when this place is suggested to go eat. Food is always hot and well juicy! Mild Lemon Pepper Shrimp is my favorite. Service is almost always amazing. I think It just depends if they are swamped with a good amount of people and even then they are good. They are very friendly, I like that they are mostly very friendly with my kids. Good food and good people. A must try!"}
{"text":"Hot N Juicy shrimp with corn was delish! Saw them on Man vs Food so I made sure to try them next time I'm in Vegas. Did not disappoint me! Awesome service, friendly staff, and yummy food!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome, and I can't wait to go back!   My son, his girlfriend, and I went out for a fun little mom/son date night. I had never been here before. First of all, I could smell the seafood when I opened my car door! It smelled so good! We walked in, and I noticed there was white plactic on all of the tables, and no silverware. My first thought was that this was going to be an interesting dinner.    We were seated really quickly. We arrived around 9, and they close at 10, so the dinner rush had already come and gone. Our server was named King, and he was great. He explaned the menu, made some recommendations, and explained how to order. We decided on 2 sets of the meal that came with 1lb of shrimp, 1lb of crawfish, corn, potatoes, and sausage. One we chose the hot and spicy seasoning on baby spice, and the other was the garlic butter seasoning also on baby spice. Glad we picked baby spice on both, as even that had a little kick to it!  The server brought out the food, and it came out in plastic bags, and super super hot! We dug in! Being newbies to this place, we honestly had no idea what the shrimp came whole hahaha my son's girlfriend and I laughed and gave each other a look when we realized we were going to have to shell and pull the faces and legs off!  The food was awesome. The corn was the best corn I have ever had. The potatoes were kind of bland, but the fish was so good. I personally liked the hot and juicy flavored sausage the best, but the garlic butter corn and shrimp.   I am totally going back for a date night with my husband. I would highly recommend! Oh, and they give you a bib, and offer gloves if needed :)"}
{"text":"Great food!! We had the shrimp with the Hot N Juicy seasoning. It was fantastic. We then ordered the clams with the Louisiana seasoning. I preferred the Hot N Juicy. We ordered extra Hot N Juicy sauce, it came out room temp. I would suggest they heat it up before serving it. I really loved how they gave you gloves to wear so your hands don't get dirty. Be prepared to have a messy meal. I also loved that I got to eat the clams with my hands as they were. That was so not proper but this restaurant isn't like that. We also ordered rolls to eat with the sauces. We ordered the soft shell crab as a side, it cam on top of fries. That was a bit too much grease for me so next time I'll just stick with one of the Juicy Cravings. Beer goes great with their food. The service was very good as well."}
{"text":"we had a pretty good experience here.  Lotsa food.... about 1 lb of shrimp is enough for a person if that's all your eating.  The medium spiciness got pretty spicy by the end of the bag.  If you're ever out in California, Boiling Crab's Whole Shebang sauce is 10x better and they give a lot more sauce in the bag."}
{"text":"Everything was really good..ended up trying the super hot shrimp and not as hot as I thought it would be but overall great food! Only thing I regret is not trying the fried brownies. Also a must try is their Cajun fries!!"}
{"text":"Unique restaurant in the states. Their food is quite spicy but of very good taste (although you can not feel the freshness because they add a lot of salt and spice). Overall it is a place for one-time going."}
{"text":"This is an awesome place I wished that there was one in the new england area, the house flavor I think is the best a good blend of hot spices and garlic I can't get enough! But netxt time I think I will try the shrimp after trying to eat the crawfish in that spicy sauce your hands hurt from the hotness. Don't forget to wear gloves or try not to touch or rub your eyes or remember to take off ur contacts before you eat or suffer the the wrath of the spices :) it doesn't wash off even after 4 times :)"}
{"text":"Was here just the other day while in town for Halloween. I came in hoping it was good, and left satisfied. They were out o f a couple of items we would have tired, but we did get the king crab, whole blue crab, crawfish, and calamari. The crawfish and the crab we got with varying amounts of heat, all on the Hot n Juicy sauce. The sauce was very good. Plenty of tase, not simply liquid butter. Add dollar beers to that(not sure if all bottles are $1 everyday or not) and it added up to a very good time. I would definately go back.  The only minus is that they really have nothing BUT seafood. Several in our party do not like this kind of seafood, so their only choice was chicken wings(which they do not even have sauces for, they come out dry) and fries. A bit small of a non seafood choice.  Our waitress was very helpful and attentive as well."}
{"text":"Do not get the snow crab. It was overcooked, and bland even with tbeir yummy sauce. Over priced, under whelmed."}
{"text":"Had to come get this before my wisdom teeth come out. Last meal lol. Worth every dollar at this place. Right amount of juices with spice. Love this place and will keep coming with the family. This place does get packed so be prepared to wait a little but always worth it. Ordered 2 pounds of crayfish and 1 pound shrimp. My favorite is hot and juicy style with medium spice. Go for baby spice if you don't like spicy. I would try the mussels also. They were really good but it does take longer to make and come out. Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Got the refund, however, the managers probably did not want to deal with me when I called the final time, lol, so they ignored my call ha.   Not cool though."}
{"text":"We did not eat all day...so we went to H&J and had the best spicy shrimp and crawfish!!! Should have ordered the extra spicy...very fast and friendly service"}
{"text":"I am from the OC and when visiting Vegas my friend was raving about this place and I gotta say this is the worst crawfish joint I've ever been too. Our food took forever to come out and it was not very good. My friend and I ordered 1 dozen oysters, 1lb crawfish, 1lb clams, 1lb shrimp, fish n chips, and 1lb snow crabs. Nothing was fresh or good except the clams and fish. The crab was $15 a lb and tasted so bland and not fresh. The dozen of oysters was also horrible. Worst oysters I've ever ate and also not fresh. My most expensive dishes were both horrible. Our bill for just 2 was $90 including tip. But not only did our food taste like crap, our waitress was very rude that she pushed us off to another waitress. The next day my whole party of 10 all had stomaches and the bathroom was our best friend. It completely ruined my Vegas trip, yet alone the car ride home and it lasted for 2/3 days. Never again hot n juicy..."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed in this place. All the food tastes exactly the same. I couldn't even tell s difference in the texture between the shrimp and the crab.  Once we ordered they brought out the good in big plastic bags, steaming hot. However, there are no sides included, and limited sides to add on even if you choose to.  It didn't get one star because Laura was great. She kept our completely flat sodas refilled, and checked back on us frequently.  Also, the corn fritters were delicious. I would say stop by and ask to sit in Laura's station, get the fritters and one kind of seafood, a beer or water, and if you're still hungry go next door for desert or up the street to Ronald's Donuts.  Really overpriced for what it is, I think."}
{"text":"Service was horrible. Took the server forever to sit us then we waited longer for the crab legs to come out because \"they take longer to cook\". as a result. I was served rubber crab legs. When I complained the manager said he would give me a half pound when I ordered a full pound. Totally unacceptable. Visiting the area and will never return or recommend this site."}
{"text":"Ordered hot n juicy shrimp, there were three in our party. Two of us were served while the third person got served the wrong shrimp. The waiter quickly apologized and took the wrong shrimp back to the kitchen and assured us the corrected order would be out in 2 minutes. After 20+ minutes the correct order arrived. Needless to say the other two in our party were done eating. The waiter assured us he would discount the delayed meal. Hahahaha he discounted it all right -- we got $1.80 discount!!!! Seriously.....will never return. Customer service sucks!!!"}
{"text":"Date/Time:   Monday - 1:30pm Occasion:    Lunch Party of:   Two Ordered:   One lb crawfish and one lb shrimp hotnjuicy style with medium spiciness, one lb shrimp spicy, and chicken wing basket with fries Location:   Fun seafood style decor; nothing fancy; large space Total incl gratuity:   $53  I love cajun style crawfish and was eager to try this place out while on my trip to Vegas.  It's off the strip near Chinatown.  We walked in and were greeted by very friendly staff members.  The food was great!  A lot less sauce than the crawfish places I've tried in the Bay Area.  If you like spicy foods, definitely go with spicy....medium is nothing!  The seafood is very fresh!  You can tell because it's easy to take the meat out.  I think their sauce is really good - you will literally find smashed garlic in the sauce, which makes is all the more yum-O!  I'm getting hungry just thinking about it.  The service is great.  The waitress has very quick and very friendly.  She informed us that they'll be opening one up in SF pretty soon so I'll be looking forward to that.  One caveat - be prepared to have garlic cajun breath for many hours after you've eaten here.  No, it doesn't even go away after a handful of mints and mouthwash.  So worth it tho..."}
{"text":"If there were 6 stars I'd rate this even better.  We found this place because of Man vs. Food. When you pass by the restaurant in China Town, it appears to be a shady massage parlor or some kind of strip joint!!  But when you walk through the doors, AMAZING!  Don't try to make reservations, this place gets too crowded for this.  And if you want to test out a new date, definitely bring 'em here.  This will determine if they like to get \"down and dirty\" or if they have a problem digging in and eatin' a real good meal.   Prepare to have your sinuses cleared.  Don't count on having good conversation, you'll be too busy scarfing down yummy food.  Everything about this place is great.  The customer service is SOOOO GOOD.  Almost all the servers are real friendly (and there are some that have been there a long time which is great).  The atmosphere (music could use a little help) is perfect for a fun group dinner (New Orlean's style).  Expect to have the best shellfish and seasoning in Vegas and expect to leave with your clothes reaking of Hot N Juicy!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was nice enough, but this was a great example of style over substance.  I came here around 3pm on a Saturday with my family hoping to get my fix of raw oysters that I miss so much after moving to the southwest but was sadly disappointed. I know it's the strip, half a dozen was $13, I wouldn't complain about that at all were they not literally all smaller than a Starburst candy. I knew I should have called Uber and gone somewhere that wasn't touristy (i.e. not the strip) but we were hungry. On top of this the service was horrible, it wasn't busy and I'd say it was even overstaffed, yet every dish for the four of us came out at extremely different times, Oysters and a Calamari app first, one po'boy for my brother 10 minutes later, chicken nuggets for my Mother another 10 minutes later, and 30 minutes later another po'boy for our friend. He got tired of waiting and asked to cancel it so we could leave since we'd nearly finished but was told it'd be out in two minutes (it wasn't).  The really annoying part was the manager coming over and explaining in a patronising way that fried food cooks differently than non-fried food, and no we didn't mishear her say they cook at different rates, nothing on our table wasn't fried aside from the earlier oysters. We pointed this out and that despite coming in long after us the table next to us was served first, it was also all fried and served at very odd times. The \"spicy\" Cajun sandwiches and calamari were bland but at least edible, the oysters were fine but *ridiculously* small, the chicken was awful however.  Maybe it was a bad day, but I'd never go back nor recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Service was Great.  We ordered 2lbs of shrimp. One with butter garlic sauce and the other with the signature hot and juicy mix\" mild\" which definitely still had some kick to it. the shrimps we large, juicy and full of flavor. To compliment our delicious bags of shrimp was great service from Marc. He was attentive, personable and very kind to us. We will be back to sample some of the other seafood I saw coming out of the kitchen that looked equally appealing."}
{"text":"This place is far from the glitz and glamour of the strip both in location and in style.  Gone are the flashing lights, white tablecloths and candles, replaced by beer in bottles, cheesy lobster bibs and food served in plastic bags.  I will say, though, that it was delicious.  I got the crawfish boil with the signature sauce.  The sauce can be ordered to whatever level of heat you desire.  I went for the extra spicy, which I will warn lives up to its name.    There is a lot of flavor here, and the sides were no less disappointing.  From the sweet potato fries to the corn on the cob, everything was excellent.  This place is obsessed with quality through simplicity, and it's no surprise that the crawfish is shipped in fresh each morning.  Finally, I would be remiss if I didn't mention the prices.  Everything here is priced well below what I would consider reasonable for what is delivered, making this a huge value for the dollar.  If you're hankering for something more low key, more down home and (way) less glamourous than what's on offer on Las Vegas Boulevard, stop on in."}
{"text":"Eating seafood from a bag wearing a bib is a fun hands on experience. We had the get your feet wet to share and it was delicious :) the staff were super friendly and the atmosphere was laid back and fun. This would have been a 5 star review except the oysters were not so great."}
{"text":"I just want to thank Erick and the rest of the crew for the great service and hospitality tonight...   Thanks again Erick for the outstanding customer service.  10 stars for you!"}
{"text":"Come to this place once a week. I'm addicted and can't get enough. The lemon pepper sauce is my favorite. The service is always amazing and greeted with smiles."}
{"text":"I just so happened to be wanting seafood and I never eat it. My kids don't really like seafood so I looked on yelp &' found Hot N Juicy Crawfish. It was my first time at a place like this and I didn't know what to get. Sara was my server and gave me excellent recommendations and great service. There was no wait what so ever. I was taken care of fast. Food was amazing, it was just enough for my kids &' I. I'll be here again for sure! THANK YOU SARA"}
{"text":"We tried it for the first time tonight. We are huge fans of Angry Crab but were at Westgate, so we decided to give it a try. Prices were pretty high, and you could only get one type of sauce added to your bag without having to pay extra. Asked for no spice but my face was on fire afterwards. Drink from the bar took well over 20 minutes and was very sweet and barely any alcohol. Asked for extra condiments, that came 5 minutes before leaving. Food was rubbery as well. Stick to Angry Crab if youre feeling a seafood broil."}
{"text":"I miss this place. I moved away from las vegas and no place here in washington seems to know how to make a flavorful garlic butter shrimp like hot and juicy. Succulent and flavorful with wonderful sized shrimps. Their mild flavor has a nice kick to it without burning your tongue. Hopefully I can come back and visit las vegas soon so I can dine here again :D"}
{"text":"I've heard from a couple people that hot and juicy is better than boiling crab.  They say its more flavorful so I went with a group of friends to try it out.  I LOVE boiling crab!  The only thing stopping me from eating it so often is the wait, and the calories!  When i went on a tuesday night it was relatively empty.  The place looks like a boiling crab and the concept is pretty much the same.   Menu is about the same too.  They have fresh oysters, the seafood boils, corn, potato, fried catfish, gumbo, fried shrimp etc.  For the four of us, we ordered 5 pounds of food.  4 pounds of shrimp in every flavor except lemon pepper, 4 corns, and 1 pound of clams in the hot and juicy sauce.   The food came quickly...and we were ready.  This place offers gloves but I say ditch it.  They are big and bulky and get in the way and in the end, your hands get soaked in the garlicky buttery oil anyways.  The hot and juicy flavor is by far my favorite.  We went with medium and there is a spicy kick to it.  Not too bad because i'm not one who can handle a whole lot of spice.  Some of the shrimp were overcooked so it was crumbling when i peeled it (minus one star).  I forgot what the other flavors were but i remember peeling the shrimp in the other bags and dipping it in the hot and juicy sauce.  Corn was really good too!  Corn is always my favorite thing to eat at places like this so I'm glad it was sweet and juicy.  The clams were very flavorful.  They soak in the sauce way better than shrimp.  You just get less food for the money though.  All in all i really like this place and will definitely come back.  I do think that they don't fully give you one pound of food.  I mean we each ate 1.25 pounds of food.  We killed everything!  And at boiling crab I usually only order 1/2 pound of shrimp with 2 corns and am STUFFED.  The sauce here is also a lot thinner.  Boiling crab is thick with tons of garlic bits but this was more watery.  I personally like a thicker sauce so its easier to grab with my shrimp.  Room for improvement but I would come here any day over the hour wait."}

{"text":"I went to the Hot N Juicy Crawfish on Harmon adjacent to Planet Hollywood and the Miracle Mile Shops for lunch on a Thursday afternoon.  I love \"mudbugs\" and Hot N Juicy had long been on my Vegas and DC \"to do\" lists.  They offer a lot more besides crawfish, but I went for what I was craving, a pound of crawfish ($14.95) with Hot N Juicy seasoning.  I believe March is right in the middle of crawfish season, so I was willing to pay a little more for live crawfish vice frozen.  Not being familiar with Hot N Juicy and their definition of spiciness, I played it safe and went with the medium spice level.  I washed it down with my new favorite beer, Joseph James Citra Rye American Pale Ale, which they had on tap.      In truth, crawfish is an acquired taste as it's extremely messy to eat and there's a lot of work for the relatively small payoff of in terms of crawfish tail meat.  It becomes an even smaller payoff if you aren't into sucking the heads.  In short order, I received a plastic bag filled with a pound of whole crawfish bathed in the Hot N Juicy sauce.  The Hot N Juicy sauce was delicious and the medium had plenty of heat (I'll admit it worked up a little sweat on my brow) without overwhelming the delicate flavors of the crawfish meat.  It was good and messy.  Thankfully, they provided a bib.  Like I said, crawfish isn't for everyone, but if you don't mind getting messy (probably not the place to go if you're wearing a suit, or white or light colored clothing), then Hot N Juicy Crawfish is a great choice to get your mudbug fix."}
{"text":"It is what it claims to be.  When you want to experience lip smacking creole inspired food that is unique in presentation, them stop on by this place.  My daughter and I both order their \"Experience\" meal.  They plopped down a bag for each of us that contained a huge portion of crawdads, shrimp, corn cobs, potato chucks and sausage bits all in a pick your own level of spiciness creole sauce.   We opted not to use provided plastic gloves and just dived right in.  Glad we did because licking your fingers of the delicious sauce is part of the fun in my humble opinion.  Fulling, fun and flavorful.   Not for the dainty be a sure fire reward for foodies that crave something outside the usual and appreciate uniqueness."}
{"text":"Honestly me and wife come here about 2-3 a month. When ever we are hungry and are looking for a place to eat, the first thing on our mind is hot n juicy. We LOVE hot n juicy. If I'd have to recommend any food places to anyone I would say the best place in arizona would be hot n juicy."}
{"text":"Normally, I like spicy food.  The server warned us that \"medium is a little hotter than tabasco, and mild still has a kick\"  Believe the woman!!  Here's a tip: Ask for a side of melted butter to cut the spiciness if you need to.  This was one of the longest, messiest meals of my life. No fault of the restaurant; crawfish takes a lot of digging.  When it was all said and done, I ordered a side of rolls (three to an order) and mopped up all that luscious, amazing, spicy sauce in the bottom of the bag, even though I had no room.  DAMN! That's good!  And, yes, I had heartburn for a full day afterwards."}
{"text":"I just wanted to add further comment that I was personally contacted by this company about my experience.  They wanted to know what day I dined so that they could investigate to find out what may have gone wrong with my meal.  I'm impressed that they care enough about their customers to followup and try to prevent any problems they can find so future diners won't have a similar experience.  Every restaurant can have a bad day, or bad product that is unknown as the product was properly prepared.   Everyone else in the place was having a great time and loving the food.  I heard no complaints, just praise, and trust me there is no way I could not hear what the people were saying ;-D.  This restaurant was listed in the top 30 must eat meals in Las Vegas and I can see why.  While I may have had some difficulties, I would still recommend eating there to other friends, especially if they want to have a good time with their meal.   Based on the chance my experience was unique, that everything I did eat was very tasty, and that this company cares as much as they do - I will be going back again another day to give them another chance.  I hope it's good.  This is the kind of place I would like to bring a group of friends to for a tasty meal and a great time - something everyone else in the place seemed to be having that night.  Service was excellent in any case."}
{"text":"As a long time fan of Boiling Crab and Kickin' Crab in Northern California I was very excited to try Hot N Juicy Crawfish here at the AZ location!  After my party was seated, orders were made. I, of course, wanted to try their crawfish in the Hot N Juicy style (their signature sauce), Medium, 2 pounds of it since it comes with corn and potatoes.  Lemons, salt and pepper was provided along with bibs and gloves, the latter if needed (but where's the fun in that?) The crawfish came out and looked very generous for two pounds. Yummy sauce, I would say very similar to Boiling Crab but sweeter, more buttery and the spiciness was just right. The crawfish were good in size, not too many dead ones, but I could tell were frozen by the texture and flavor of their tail meat. The potatoes and corn were good dipped in the sauce however. I tried some shrimp which tasted fresh in the Garlic Butter sauce which was good and the calamari was kind of lack luster.  The service is a bit strange, they do attempt to refill waters almost every 2 minutes and each order comes out one at a time which is awkward for large groups. What do I do with this large bag of food while everyone else is waiting on theirs? Of course, wait ... but still it's awkward.  Same pricing as back home, but definitely isn't a crawfish place that can hold a candle to any of the previously stated two."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is always great and it hits the spot. The prices are very reasonable for the amount of food you are served. The staff is always very friendly as well. I've been to another location, but this one always works best for me and there's pleanty of parking space."}
{"text":"We love love loved it. Flavor, options, portions, customer service, everything was great. At 1st I was a little hesistant due to some recent, not so good yelp reviews. However, I took the chance anyway  and I am glad I did. My kids who are 12 and 10 loved the food and experience. For a Party of 5, We ordered \"The Drool\" and \"Get your feet wet\", both were recommended by our awesome waitress Nicole!! Since my kids cant handle too spicy we chose baby spice with juicy cajon flavor, it was perfect for everyone and got medium spice on the side.. delicious! Nicole gets 5 stars! She was great and made this experience extra special. We told her it was our 1st time and she truly took her time explaining food options, she even taught my kids how to peel their own crawlfish. I am glad everyone in our party truly enjoyed the food."}
{"text":"Not good and very weird. #1 I want to say, the waiters and waitresses tried to do a great job but they are disabled by a bad system. We ordered corn fritters, sausage, shrimp, crab, fries, corn, calimari, potatoes. The food came out 1 at a time and in a very odd order. My shrimp came out 20 minutes before my husbands crab. Very uncomfortable for a meal. What we thought was going to be an appetizer came mid meal. There is no designated waiter/waitress which made the experience odd and unsuccessful. We were asked 6 times if we were ready to order after we had already put in our order. Again, the staff were so nice but clearly the training and the overall plan are a mess. Our fries were brought to our table completely frozen. They never hit a fryer at all. We are still trying to figure out how this happened. Frozen, straight from the bag but served to us. This was my husbands birthday dinner, we just laughed. My potatoes were stone cold along with the corn. My shrimp was not deveined which is gross and unsanitary. My husband ordered the crab and only got 3 legs which seems odd. We also had to pay $1 for butter, who serves crab without butter? We had to ask for cocktail sauce for the shrimp, a pail for trash and an extra fork. Someone else mentioned chickens with their heads cut off, that explains the staff exactly. Although working hard, they are misguided. Clearly this restaurant is trying to break the mold, unfortunately they are missing the mark. We left to have deserts at another restaurant. Although our wait staffers tried very hard, we will not return nor recommend this place. Come on, frozen fries? No manager coming to our table to apologize. They all acted that this was not the first time this has happened. Sad sad sad, we had high hopes."}
{"text":"best food ever i had the shrimp crawfish clams mussels and crab!!!"}
{"text":"We had an amazing waitress name Allie who was so sweet, answered all our questions, kept our drinks full and hearts happy! We had crawfish, shrimp, fried shrimp, corn fritter, Cajun fries, and chicken nuggets.  Great staff and food!"}
{"text":"I go to Vegas FOR this place's crawfish.  I'm a huge fan of Cajun style seafood and they do it very well here. I haven't experienced a significant difference in the different spiciness levels. Also, definitely choose at least mild. My rating is basically for the taste of the Crawfish. It's exactly the way I like it. The only problem is it's in vegas and you usually do other things there like sit through a 2-3 hour show or go to an area with a lot of other people who will smell the garlicy cajun sauce all over your breathe and fingers.  The service as I remember has been fine every time (twice with a year a separation between). I have only ordered the crawfish although my friends said the shrimp was great too. It's a messy experience so don't wear clothes you mind getting dirty.  I have nothing but good memories. I always eat too much and border on destroying my stomach but i mean... look at what you're eating. There has to be some enormous bag of cayenne pepper somewhere in the kitchen. I never regret it though and I even wake up the next day wanting to do it again. There is however a lot of garlic involved so ... think about what you're doing that evening.  I suggest doing it the night before you leave (sleep it off and clear your system before you fly ... DO THIS...) and maybe before the part of the vacation you don't have anything special planned."}
{"text":"Came to this place yesterday because this was supposed to be the new and updated hot n juicy . Walked in when tables were full with no one in line . A couple groups came in after us and I guess there was a discrepancy where one waiter was gonna skip us when we were actually next . Got to our table our waiter was a male and he was kind of rushing . My friend had been there recently before but it had been a while for me . I wanted to ask him about the different seafood specifically the crawfish. He said they didn't have live only frozen and said there was a bit of a taste difference . After going back and fourth about the pros and cons of frozen vs live he finally said they could give us a sample . He brought us water and didn't come back for about 15 minutes to take our order. I told him I wanted to order when we had our sample and he looked like he forgot about our sample altogether. When he finally brought it out the crawfish was dry. It had no sauce or anything it tasted like they microwaved it and put it in a bowl with nothing on it. Hard pass. I ordered the shrimp instead. From the time we ordered to about 15 minutes after our food came our waiter was MIA . We flagged down the 'lead server' SELINA multiple times to retrieve our waiter each time she said he was 'busy' the last time she copped THE WORST attitude and said 'he's busy and I'm your server now what do you need' I couldn't believe her attitude . We didn't get a bucket for our shells . Our waters were empty it was THE WORST experience . I was also having trouble peeling the shell off my shrimp and I asked SELINA if she knew a better way to peel them and she rudely said 'we don't offer that here' Seriously ? Then I repeat my question and she again gave THE WORST ATTITUDE IVE EVER GOTTEN FROM A SERVER . She said 'oh you need ME to show you how I do it' ? As if she was being sarcastic about me needing her help . After that our original server started showing up again . And by then I was COMPLETELY DISSATISFIED WITH THEIR SERVICE. I don't know what she was going through or how our table caught the brunt of SELINA'S attitude but I promise I will NEVER come here as long as she is working there ."}
{"text":"Sooooo delicious and flavorful love sucking the juice out of the heads of the shrimp lobsters super good if you love spicy and seafood than this is the place for you"}
{"text":"Gave this 1* because the service the past few times I have eaten here has been horrible....and I go to both. Last night my boyfriend and I went to the smaller one and the server (male) took our order which was raw oyster's, crawfish, shrimp and the crispy pork skins after 20mins we asked the server about our order he said \"he put it in\" mind you two other couples cane in after us got their food we then asked about our food again he then said \"sorry ticket got lost in the back\" now I'm in the industry and I know things happen but I know he didn't put our order in at all because after the 1st we asked that should have made him remember and the couple who sat next us ordered the same thing if he was a good server he would have gave us their order.. . well we were pissed after 4Omins so we went to the broiling crab where our service was awesome even after they were about to close they still allowed us to order.  You have lost a good customer"}
{"text":"Did I really just eat what I just ate?  Wow.  Immediately you have the bib put on you.  You then order everything by the bag.  They claim that their super spicy is really spicy, but this is not the case.  Don't be afraid to eat spicy, it is the best sauce.of the bunch.  Also sprinkle a little bit of lemon on everything and you will not be disappointed.  Don't eat here if you don't want to get covered in sauce.  In addition to the bib, they also give you gloves.  Everything you eat is covered in sauce and nothing is shelled.  You gotta know that you will get dirty, but it is worth it.    We ordered crab, crayfish, breaded catfish, and shrimp.  The shrimp was by far my favorite.  Order extra shrimp and don't waste your money on the crab.  You only get two wimpy crabs for the same price as you get 25-30 shrimp.  Also order the corn fritters.  They are very good.  Again, this place was a really nice change of pace from where we had eaten in Vegas previously.  The prices were good, we all ate for under $18 a person, which was really reasonable."}
{"text":"My brother, wife and kids were in town and spotted this as we drove and bombarded me with questions. It was good the last time I went, but it wasn't impressive that I was dying to go back. I was dreading a very ridiculous wait, but they said 20 minutes and it seemed like we got seated sooner than that. I guess in the recent year they've really ironed out their efficiency since our orders came swiftly was well.  Ordered shrimp, crawfish, and clams in HNJ sauce, andouille sausage in hot butter, and one in lemon butter, half a dozen raw oysters, and rice. I've never been a fan of crawfish since it's a whole lot of shell for a little bitty nub of meat. The shrimp was big, juicy and perfectly cooked. The clams were pretty good but a few had a bit of sand still. I guess that's just a typical hazard with shells. After trying the sausages in other sauces, I still prefer the HNJ as my sauce- spicy and garlicky good. I was a tad miffed last time I came here with $2 rice being a piddly scoop- they made the serving bigger which they should. Asians rejoice!  My family liked this place so that's good. Sometimes being a Yelper everyone thinks you know ALL the things and I feel pressure being different in food taste too.   Service was great. Very friendly, checked on us often, fast about getting things. I really think the staff here has finally figured out a groove. Only helps them to faster turnover.  Of course this is a messy experience, but if you don't like getting your hands all garlicky and seafood smelling, you can request gloves! My nephew wanted gloves so his hands don't smell. They give you bibs of course but this isn't the spot to wear something nice to and avoid long sleeves like white button downs. Cracking shells is a splatter hazard.   Yeah, this place is hyped to hell and I don't think is the greatest thing to happen to seafood like people make it out to be, but it is solid if you just want simple, fresh seafood. Sometimes clambake style food just hits that spot. If only it came with a sea view, I would feel complete."}
{"text":"Ambiance: 4 - Big room. Lots of loud people. Television and good food. It's just my kind of place to be. It's super casual inside, and definitely fits the theme of the restaurant.   Service: 5 - The service was fast and responsive, and our server was super funny! There was absolutely nothing to complain about. It was pretty much excellent!  Food: 4 - I like and crave seafood all the time, so this is one of my go-to places for that. They give you gloves and bibs, which are a little bit pointless, because you end up smelling like sauce and garlic over your entire self, no matter what you do!!   Like a regular 'seafood and sauce' place, everything is styled so you can pick your food and basically make it how you want it. Because I'm a poor college student, I always get shrimp in the Hot N Juicy in medium or mild! And if you're Asian, like me, you know you're spending on that bowl of rice! Unless you're on some diet that day. But let's face it, you're at Hot N Juicy, you came to eat!!   Sometimes, when I save up money, I'm able to upgrade myself to crab legs and raw oysters..you know, on special occasions and such :)   If you like a lot of meat, I would suggest crab or shrimp, since they really have the most worthwhile amounts of that. The crawfish are actually really small here, and I'm not a fan of the taste, anyway.   It is a great place to go when you're hungry! Just scrub, scrub, scrub when you're at home, because the smell will take a bit of work to get rid of!!"}
{"text":"I freaking love this place! I wish we had one in Oklahoma where I am from! The food is outstanding and the atmosphere is awesome! We got shrimp with the hot n juicy special with mild spice... And it was DELISH! Def a must try! We will come at least once every visit to LV!"}
{"text":"Hot n juicy or boiling crab? Either one they are both comparable to me at least for the Vegas locations. You know what you're getting everything, never disappoints."}
{"text":"Went here to dinner last week with a couple of friends visiting from out of town. From the outside it doesn't particularily stand out. Upon opening the door though, one gets a huge waft of what's to come inside. The air just permeated of spicy, garlicky goodness. I tell you, it smelled SO good. A bit of disclaimer on this review: I'm not too big on most seafoods so take it with a grain of salt, for sure.  I realize it might sound odd then, that I would want to go to such a place. But hey, I love good friends and good food. And both at the same time? Fuhgedaboudit! And besides, theres still plenty I can find to partake of on the menu. By reading some of the Yelp reviews previously, it seemed the thing to make a nice mess of what's left at the end of one's meal. You are prepared for the upcoming melee with stylish HnJ logo plastic bibs and tools to dismantle shells. We were also warned that their sauces were very hot, so it was suggested to order one level lower than what you think you want. My friends got a mix of HnJ shrimp, crab legs, clams and crawfish. I opted for some etoufee, sweet potato fries and fried catfish basket with cajun fries. I also asked for some HnJ special medium sauce on the side so I could drench everything in it. My friend said all their food was great. I loved the HnJ special sauce. Probably could've gone to Hot, but the medium had a nice kick with savory garlic-ness. I was using a spoon to scoop the sauce from the bottom to make sure I got all the garlic bits and spices that settle to the bottom. I did have a feeling there was no cajun seasoning on the fries. No big deal, I just used the side sauce. Overall service and food was right on."}
{"text":"Spectacular. Bold flavors. Unique experience. Definetly not forgettable. Tried it for the first time last week and going again tomorrow.   The best 2lbs of hot and juicy shrimp of my life. A must in Vegas !"}
{"text":"This is one of my all- U.S. Favorites now. The seafood is fantastic! I like it spicy and they bring it (crab legs, lobster, crawfish, shrimp, etc.) to you all in a clear bag with a pair of gloves and a bib so you can tear into it and not get it all over you. They make it very spicy of you like it that way like I do! If you have the chance try it, you won't be disappointed and you WILL be back."}
{"text":"Sooooooooooo good!!!  Sunday evening at 7pm and it was packed...for good reason.  We ordered the \"Drool\" to share between two and from the first bite to the last it was beyond tasty. The corn was the best I have ever had. Simple menu and great interior space. Really nothing I could complain about...definitely deserves the high reviews it has. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious ... however the service could be better! I'm a local customer that visits often. I feel the prices have went up and the food is not equivalent to your order. I ordered a pound of crab and got 3 crab legs , asked to speak to the lead and he told me he would take my food In The back and take a picture with his phone to prove to me it was a pound ... I buy crab in the grocery store and you get at least 2 full 4 leg crabs . I just wish he would've gave me another leg or two or charged me less than $18 for 3 legs .. As well as getting soda In my water !!  But I truly love juicy just wish the service was better at times !"}
{"text":"This place is so amazing!  The food is absolutely to die for.  It's amazing! And such a fun eating experience.  I live in Texas and dream about coming back here!"}
{"text":"While the service here was great - the staff was wonderfully friendly and attentive - and the flavor of the food was pretty good, my boyfriend and I have been violently ill all morning. With the stomach pain and cold sweats, pretty sure it's food poisoning.  Sad too, this was my first time trying crawfish."}
{"text":"Heard about it, watched it on Man vs Food, but the experience was so much better!  Much more than just crawfish, they serve lobster and crab legs - snow and king - on the menu.  You can customize the heat and sauce offerings.    Ask for Tiffany - as a server, she's attentive and knows how to turn a table without rushing you.  To clarify my definition of attentive - the best servers are those who anticipate and observe.  They know when you need a refill or when a look of confusion crosses someone's face when they are looking at seafood tools like the cracker and splitter.  Tiffany is one of these.  Ask for her and complete a wonderful dining experience!"}
{"text":"Garlic shrimp.... yummy! This new location of Hot N Juicy, impressed the shrimp outta me. I was very impressed with the cleanliness and customer service. compared to the other Hot N Juicy i would say this is the best location they have. They have television for you sports fanatics. My best friend and I had dinner here one evening, we ordered the garlic shrimp and lobster legs. It was delicious and had no complaints at all. Service was phenomenal they checked on you and refilled your waters all the time. I will definitely go back to this place, had a great experience!"}
{"text":"First experience at HNJ last night as part of the UYE (unofficial Yelp event) and I had a good time. There were a good 18 or so of us there and everyone seemed to enjoy their food. The servers were very friendly and helpful. The place was packed but the food came out really quick once it was ordered. I had Blanche meet me there and neither of us were into the whole eating crawfish and messy thing so we took the easy way out and got some baskets. I ordered the Fried Shrimp basket (10pieces) for around $10.00 and a side order of sweet potato fries for $4.50. Blanche ordered the Fried Catfish basket that comes with fries for $9 and change. The fried shrimp was delicious. Cooked perfectly and nice size pieces of shrimp. However, at pretty much a dollar a shrimp I thought it was very overpriced. The sweet potato fries I could eat every day. So good. A bit overpriced at nearly $5 for a medium size basket of fries but oh well. Beer was $2.50 for domestics and $3 for imports. Not bad. Was a little disappointed to have them run out of Bud Light after the first one I ordered. I usually don't like switching beers once I start drinking one but I made an exception to try a Blue Moon. Overall it was a cool place and everyone else seemed to be having fun \"playing\" with their food. Or maybe its \"working\" on their food because it seemed like it got difficult at times. On a last note.. I do wish they would work on the temperature in their. I think it was cooler outside."}
{"text":"So far I've eaten here twice.  First time was dine-in and the food was awesome.  Second time was take-out and it seemed undercooked.  Even though crawfish is in their name, to get the most bang for your bucks stick with shrimps and crabs as they have more meat whereas the crawfish is mostly shell.  The fried catfish was excellent & the french fries' portion was large and a good foil for the spicy sauce they boil their shellfish in."}
{"text":"I wanted to celebrate my friends birthday on my day off so I decided to treat her and her fiance to some Hot and Juicy Crawfish.  I grew up in so cal where Boiling Crab reigns supreme, and after moving to Vegas I've had an empty void that needed filling.  I saw the Man vs Food episode and I've read the reviews before stepping in, So I came in excited, hungry and craving crawfish.     Between the 3 of us this is what we ordered. dozen raw oysters, catfish basket, 2# shrimp hot n juicy special very spicy with corn and sausage, and 1# crawfish hot n juicy special medium spicy.  The only complaint about the service was that our raw oysters, which should have been the first thing to come out, showed up on the table last.  Raw Oysters- accompanied by cocktail sauce, lemons, horse radish and tabasco.  I'm a big fan of oysters and these were decent in size (comparable to hama hama), but without any accompaniments they were very bland.  Oysters are suppose to taste like the sea, but these were washed so much they tasted watery and flavorless.    Catfish basket- breaded in a cornmeal crust served over a bed of french fries and accompanied by ketchup and tartar sauce.  Personally I'm not a big fan of cornmeal breading, but I can't really hold that against the establishment and their recipe.  Catfish was moist and flaky and had a hint of cayenne which perfected the \"Southern\" flavor.  I actually enjoyed this the most.    Shrimp hot n juicy special very spicy-  We ordered this with corn and sausage, both of which were awesome.  the corn was sweet and complimented the spice well. the sausage was spicy and tender and added a bold meaty flavor to the sauce for the shrimp.  the \"hot n juicy special\" sauce isn't as flavorful as I expected, and the \"very spicy\" here is comparable to  \"medium spicy\" at Boiling Crab.  But the flavor was decent and the shrimp themselves were \"okay\".  Not the freshest shrimp I've ever had but they weren't rotten or anything, but what can you really expect in the middle of the desert?   Crawfish hot n juicy special medium spicy-  I'm debating whether or not I should even review this item just because I should have known better than to order this when I already know that crawfish is out of season at this time.  Needless to say we received a previously frozen, bland, rubbery product.  So I'm just going to comment on the sauce, which was the same on the shrimp, but this had significantly less flavor.  Perhaps, more spicy=more flavor, or it could be that there wasn't sausage and corn in this bag to add to the flavor.    Maybe I'm being a bit unfair because I'm comparing this establishment to Boiling Crab.  However the food was decent and a better alternative to a lot of other restaurants I've been to in Vegas.  If I was asked to come here again, I would, but I don't see myself CRAVING Hot and Juicy Crawfish like I do for Boiling Crab.  I guess my best advice is if you're a Boiling Crab fan don't expect too much out of this place.  if you're just looking to satisfy a seafood craving this would be a good supplement while you're out in the middle of the desert."}
{"text":"Very tasty! Snow crab legs is great however crawfish are too small. I tried hot & juicy sauce & I like it. Great service!"}
{"text":"I had my doubts about this place at first but now I am fan! I was always told the Boiling Crab is better but my tummy begs to differ. First of all, their shrimp and crawfish are bigger which translates to MORE MEAT. Plus, their spicy is actually spicy.   I gotta say though, parking sucks. Tiny ass lot and no shade, but eh, it's not like I plan to eat their food outside in my car. Anyway, the servers were very attentive, so if I have to compare again to BC, well... there's really no comparison as I've never received good service from BC.   On the two occasions that I've been here, I've never had to wait for a seat so that's always nice =)"}
{"text":"There's a reason why there are 3 Hot N Juicy locations in Vegas.   Hot N Juicy is BETTER than Boiling Crab.   I was impressed with their opening weekend. I had a flawless dining experience tonight for the following reasons:  - SHORT WAIT - Don't let the 10-15 hungry diners in the waiting area fool you.  This place has FAST table turnover. - Greeted by server right away and drinks came by a minute later. - Orders were taken promptly - Food came out quick and hot (C'mon it's seafood & fried stuff...there is no reason why it should take long anyway) - Food was flavorful and cooked right! - Convenient sinks in the back for dirty hands. - Less than $20 for dinner for two :)  We ordered the lemon pepper shrimp (medium spice level) 1 lb. $12 and two side orders of rice (generous portions) $2 each  The layout and interior is nicer here compared to other locations.  Be prepared to leave smelling like the aromas of the restaurant & having a seafood or spicy taste in your mouth. Also, no desserts on the menu.  The new location on Eastern is surrounded by many places to satisfy your sweet tooth that it is pretty much a gimme after eating at Hot N Juicy. Frozen yogurt, frozen custard, boba, crepes and waffles. You name it.  Can't wait to get my hands dirty again!"}
{"text":"Came here to help celebrate a birthday. Unfortunately, the energy and vibe seemed very awkward and confusing. The party that I came with had a table near the front. The staff was not able to accommodate our seating due to safety hazards. Understandable, but didn't need the rude team member Melanie whom by the way was very rude.... honestly I was really shocked ... what a way to ruin a birthday get together. I love the food here but she just really ruined the vibe for tonight. Sucks but I guess we'll have to just deal with it. Some of us still haven't been seated and not sure when we can order food or drinks because we haven't been updated on the status. Maybe my experience will be better next time. :("}
{"text":"Incredible!  My boyfriend heard about this place from Man v. Food.  OMG it was so amazingly good.  We took a cab from the strip and a cab back to Binion's and worth every penny.  The servers were friendly, the owner very attentive and the food was amazing.  I had crawfish for the first time.  Not a lot of meat but watch out, they're spicy is super spicy. I'd be afraid to try the Extra Spicy option. The best thing I had there was the bag of Lemon Pepper shrimp.  Oh, my mouth is watering just thinking about it.  This will definitely be a must-eat place everytime we visit Vegas. SOOOO good."}
{"text":"The sauce....could do better. To me, there's no flavor, so bland. The sauce is too thin for my taste. I order the medium and it was mild. The sausage wasn't that great. I felt like I was eating a hot dog instead of sausage. At least I tried, but I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I got 2 pounds of crayfish and 1/2 pound of shrimp.  Honestly, it's all about the sauce.  you can dip a dirty old sock (i got the hot n juicy special which is like a combo of all the sauces) and it would taste good.  the crayfish was pretty hard to eat - takes a lot of time to deshell and the meat isn't that tasty to make it worth the effort.  the shrimp is a much better - less work, less shelling, and they give you pretty descent size shrimp for $10.99 a pound.  my only complaint is that they don't really sell any carbs to go with that delicious sauce - like some white rice, or bread or pasta.  i would go find that old sock to dip it in, so i can eat more of the sauce.  it is very messy, so don't go in your sunday best.  and you will probably need a change of clothes, bath and manicure after eating here, but it's pretty well worth the trip.  if i lived in vegas, i would do the take out - because it's kinda embarrassing licking your fingers in public, and walking out with all these little splatters all over your shirt."}
{"text":"We had the hot and juicy hot seasoning and it was incredibly delicious. The customer service was great and the food was out of this world. Parking was hard to come by so we were thankful we got there early. We can't wait to go back.  Perfect spot if you want to go off the beaten path in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"My order was to go and I always order to go because my friends were lazy. LOL  Delicious food, friendly staff, blah blah blah.  I feel like I am in love"}
{"text":"It's cheap.  It's messy.  It's fun.    Decided to give this place a try since its right across one of our local favorites (Pho So 1).  Was not disappointed.  We did just crawfish and a lot of it.  So it comes in a plastic bag filled with whatever sauce you want.  Be careful, the spicy sauce is VERY hot.   Just open the bag and begin tearing into them little crawfish.  Ample paper towels are provided at the table.  It's not fancy.  Service is friendly, local, and appropriate for this place.  Worth a try."}
{"text":"Went straight to Hot N Juicy when my friends & I landed in Vegas last week. I saw this joint on Travel Channel & being a fan of Louisiana  Style Crawfish...it was mandatory that we hit up this place.   The Crawfish were GINORMOUS & tasted pretty good. Could've used more seasoning, but it was  pretty decent considering the size of their Brown River Crawfish. I'd say the crawfish & the sauce here is tastier than Boiling Crab, but I still like Crab Hut much better. If Crab Hut served these steroid induced crawfishes...I'd be there prepared for high cholesterol.   Customer service kinda sucked cuz we ordered Calamari, which never came out...even after several reminders. Other than that everything else was great...we will be coming back the next time we're in Vegas & will continue to tell our friends about this place."}
{"text":"Same menu as the other location. They will tell you 20 min wait and sit 1 hour later. The wait is just as long as the other location. The reason I am giving this a 2 star verses a 1 star is because the only person that cared about her job or customers was the hostess tonight. Leaving this place after 3 hours. Very inefficient service and customer service. Very disconnected team. Took forever to get food. Even ordered rice and had to ask 3 times. We finally got after hour at table. Asked for knife to cut corn for kids with braces. Asked 2 times after another 30 min finally got.  Then got done and asked for the bill and finally got fed up went to counter to get it. Credit card machine was down and they are writing my number down on a piece of paper... Unbelievable and never had such an experience at the other location."}
{"text":"I don't like crawfish.  But all is not lost.  There are other hot n juicy items on the menu.  5lbs of delicious garlic butter shrimp is where our table started and we kept on going!  That catfish basket was my favorite.  It was tender and juicy.  The light and crisp cornmeal flour crust that made that all important first bite a thumbs up.    During the whole meal, i could not help but compare it to my first dinner in a plastic bag experience at the Boiling Crab in LA.  They are both good and l can't decide which I like best.  I'm leaning HnJ just because it's in Vegas!  BUT...what if they were right next to each other?  Which would I choose?  Aw man, now it's difficult to decide.  I'm not going to cop out and say both.   HnJ has more heat than BC.  The medium spice at HnJ for example is hotter than BC's.  Seafood selection is about the same in both.  Service was better at HnJ.  Waiting time at HnJ was a lot faster than BC.  HnJ represents Cajun seafood better than BC.  Hot n Juicy wins!."}
{"text":"It is an experience to say the least. If you like crawfish, this place is obviously for you. I am not sure how people order 3 pounds of them, but I would recommend the shrimp if you go. I had those and they were good. The place was slammed."}
{"text":"This review is for the newer Hot N Juicy at 3863 Spring Mountain Rd.  We got a pound and a half of shrimp with sausage and corn, along with lobster in Hot N Juicy Special (MED).  We made sure to stop by here on our Vegas trip. One quick cab ride from MGM, and 15 mins later we were elbow deep in amazing seafood.  The sausage here is sweet, and goes well with the flavor we choose. It does have a kick, so make sure you have water and beer."}
{"text":"Pros:  Nice place with a good vibe Wait list is your cell phone number, so you can walk around and get a text when your table is ready Unique dining experience with the bags/gloves  Prices: For those looking for prices, it goes by market - Fish ranged from about $9.99lb on the low end for shrimp to $25/lb for lobster. Crab seemed to be about $15/lb. They don't mix items (so 1/2 lb of crab and 1/2 lb crawdads) but you can split with your table. Sides are extra.   Cons: Food comes out staggered - so you have no idea what will be delivered. Example: a bowl of rice came out 10 mins before the main course that went with it. My food came out long before my friends. Meaning everyone sits with their food getting cold waiting for the rest of the table to get their food.  Inside has a very STRONG fish smell. Kind of what you'd think the inside of a crowded  3rd world women's prison would smell like. The patio was much nicer.   Limited items for people who don't like seafood - and by this, I mean zilch. Chicken nuggets. Our server told us we could go anywhere around the restaurant, buy food we liked and bring it back to eat there. WTF?  Lastly - spice level could be explained better. A mild hot n' juicy spice was far too hot for several in our party, but a medium garlic butter spice was much calmer.   It wasn't spectacular and while I applaud the uniqueness, it wasn't a good mix for a party that had varying love/hate on seafood.  Update: Shortly after writing this review, the manager contacted me and offered a $20 credit to come back and try it again. She offered to retrain the staff on spice levels etc. A nice gesture, but I turned her down. There are too many places to eat in Phoenix to go back to one that fell so short."}
{"text":"I loves me a good seafood boil. Mainly a crab and shrimp boil. I've never eaten a boil at a restaurant but want reserved because this particular place is well known by many. In our boil, king crab legs, whole Dungeness, prawns, potatoes and corn with the sauce that has a mixture of all the sauces. Ooohh yes! Perfect. My one and only issue...not complaint, was I wish they would've took the helmet of of the Dungeness crab. I.could've enjoyed it more"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. We have 2lbs of crawfish, 1 lb of shrimp, 1 dozen oysters and two beers for $60! The seasoning was fabulous. Wish it was closer to my house so we could go every week. This is a must try restaurant."}
{"text":"I come here every time I visit Vegas.  I lived in New Orleans for several years and know what good crawfish is supposed to taste like. This place is the real deal, best crawfish/shrimp in town for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"This place is a must go if ur in Vegas. Similar to the boil in NYC but more spice, bigger, and a little cheaper. Get there early because it gets crowded quick. Snow crablegs with the hot and juicy sauce mild was amazing. The black mussel in the butter garlic sauce was OMG good. I will definitely come back here."}
{"text":"I wish I could give more stars for this place because the sauce is absolutely amazing, this is more of a personal rating. I'm not a fan of being lied to so when I asked for live crawfish I expect live crawfish. When I asked if our bag was mixed with live and frozen the server said they don't even have frozen, only live.   Born and raise in Houston, TX, my tongue can definitely tell the difference between the two. In which I received about a handful that were deliciously fresh and the rest were frozen.   Service is decent. Not amazing, but not awful. Overall, just do not deceive the customers."}
{"text":"It ain't boiling crab but it's the closest we have here in Vegas. And this review is much more of a personal preference of which seasoning I prefer between the two. Being from Cali I might be bias but there is a bit more spice and kick in flavor in the whole Shabang sauce than Hot&Juicy special sauce.  But just a bit so the difference is tolerable. Everything else as far as the menu goes is the same.  The biggest difference though between the two is the service.  It's my second time here and I've excused my first experience. Slow waiter, you have to request for salt, pepper and lime, and bibs.  In Boiling Crab, all that is already a given and they tie the bib around your neck for you.  Me and my friend were seated right away but a group of 5 or more, expect atleast an hour wait. Overall with the exception of the service, food was great."}
{"text":"Our waiter spark was very attentive he listened to our order got everything right! Overall experience the food is hands down the best. I'm from Orange County so all I have is boiling crab or kickin crab. I wish I could have a hot n juicy close by :("}
{"text":"The food was amazing.   The staff was awesome as well. The atmosphere was welcoming.  Will definitely be back.  I can taste the Cajun Calamari now! Yum"}
{"text":"After hearing about this place and about how great it is. Me and some friends decided to come here while in town.   We ordered 2lbs of shrimp with hot n juicy seasoning, 1lbs of crawfish with hot n juicy seasoning and fried catfish. The shrimp was under cooked thoroughly and the flavor was bland! The crawfish were dirty and not fresh either. The catfish was neither firm nor fresh.   Our experience was disappointing. Service was good. We will never return!"}
{"text":"Any place where I need to wear a bib, is an instant favorite! Ok, I've been to Boiling Crab and other comparable places many times and all had their similarities and differences. Some people like the flavoring at BC and others like it at this place or that. etc...   So back to Hot n Juicy. We came here when it just opened for lunch (we knew about the crowds during lunch and dinner), we sat immediately and I ordered crawfish and shrimp both with med hot and juicy special. And you know what... i liked it. The crawfish was cooked right (not over cooked which i've gotten at other establishments) and there were different sizes of crawfish. a few really large ones to. the shrimp was equally tasty. With a side of salt, pepper and lime juice... oh my. I have my routines.  I also ordered the corn, sausage and cajun fries. Got a couple of Coronas to wash it down with and I was happy.   Ok, I wasn't really hungry.... ;) jk.  Service was friendly and attentive as well as attractive. Dining area is a decent size and i can see it getting a little cramp'd when it's a full house. Has a local dive feel. Don't expect gourmet here.  Sorry to hear about other's bad experiences at this place, as it was a good one for my friends and I. I look forward to going back and right when it opens for lunch. :) If you've never been, give it a try. Enjoy! :)"}
{"text":"Although I enjoy Boiling Crab's whole shabang sauce better than this place, I do have to give them credit for their crawfish and the sauce. Their crawfish are large sized and filled with a lot of flavor. I would go here again for sure when I'm in Vegas. Spicy sauce is probably my favorite.  Shrimp was tasty as well. I'd probably give them 5 stars but I'll visit here a couple more times to check consistency."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were craving Boiling Crab (BC) while we were in Vegas visiting his parents. So we yelped for the new Boiling Crab in Vegas, but stumbled across Hot N Juicy Crawfish so we decided to give it a try. GOOD CHOICE!! I am happy to report that this is my new favorite hot spicy cajun shrimp place to eat! There doesn't seem to be a line here to eat, which is good because I hate waiting for more than an hour for food.   Service is really good here. Our waitress explained everything and gave us her recommendations. And when your water is low they come and fill it rather quickly. The waiters and waitresses are usually walking around and asking how everything is.   I think prices were a dollar more than BC but that's okay. Totally worth it. We usually order just 2lb of shrimp (I can't even eat half) and cajun fries to share. And we got the medium spicy hot n juicy special.   The shrimp: It's so good. It's better than the shrimp at BC because the shrimp here are more plump and drenched more in sauce! Sometimes at BC it's either you get small shrimp or not enough sauce. But here, it looked like everyone's bags came with lots of sauce and plump shrimps. I think that is a win.  The cajun fries: Hot spicy goodness in the mouth. I felt like my mouth was on fire just after a couple! I love spicy food so this was a win in my book. It doesn't look like they just sprinkle the cajun sauce on the fries, but it looks like they cook it while the fries are in the fryer because it is seriously explosion of cajun flavor in your mouth after one bite.  Next time I'm in Vegas, I'm going to make a stop here. It's not near the strip so if you are visiting and staying on the strip, get a rental car or taxi it over to the \"chinatown\" of Vegas."}
{"text":"If your in the mood for some good Cajun food at a great price I would recommend.  I came her for my first visit because me and my Wife were craving some shrimp and oysters.  We good both and were surprised at the great price.  It a no thrills type of place.  The shrimp came in a plastic bag and its peel and eat; so be prepared to get messy.  No worries because they supply bibs.  They also have a slew of different sauces and spice levels you can choose from.   Our server was great.  She was very relaxed and took the time to explain the menu and give some recommendations.    We got beer because that what sounded good and at $3 a cup their pricing was great.  Parking is a little bit of an issue, and they do not validate the garage that is next to it.  So be prepared to probably pay for parking.  Bottom-Line I will be back; and do recommend."}
{"text":"I like the food here but I also value my time. I tried to call ahead to place an order to go. I called 5 times in 20 minutes but nobody picked up the phone. So I had to come to order in person.   The waitress told me it should take about 15 minutes for my order. I waited for about 15 minutes outside and came inside to check to find out that my order was not ready. Then I had to wait another 25 minutes to finally get my food.   If it takes 40 minutes to prepare 1 lb of shrimp then you should not tell me it takes about 15 minutes. Thank you for wasting my time!"}
{"text":"When the crawfish and blue crabs are fresh...they are the most delectable, mouth-watering, delicious dish in the world (wow...it makes me salivate just thinking about it)! If you love crawfish! This is the place! The Hot N Juicy seasoning (the mix of everything) is the best I've ever tasted. I'm a chicken, so I stick to mild...  But I didn't give them 5 stars because if the CRAWFISH ARE FROZEN...STAY AWAY! The waitress did warn us...and they were $6.99/lb but my sister was in town for Thanksgiving, and I raved to her about this place. EEEE GADS! We got 5 lbs and they WERE MUSHY! I think my sister complained of a belly ache afterwards. Not me, I have a strong stomach for crawfish...ha ha...  We did get a couple pounds of the fresh blue crabs and they were heavenly and the meat sweet and tender!  Also, be prepared...IT's MESSY! Make sure you wear a bib. Thank goodness there are plenty of paper towels...I think I used up a whole roll...  I highly recommend this place, as long as the crawfish and seafood are fresh! I think between July - September, they are the biggest!!! I'm sure I will be back there in January when they are in season (small...? Who cares...it's still CRAWFISH)!"}
{"text":"Great shrimp and crawfish! It's not Louisiana, but it is as close as you can get in the area. I will say it is season dependent, which is something you should expect for the crawfish. I have gone a few times and the crawfish were not up to par... but you shouldn't expect it at all times of the year. It is extremely busy, but the food is great! Plan on getting messy... the experience is just as great as the shrimp!"}
{"text":"Loved it. The corn on the cob with butter only is to die for.... We got 1lbs of shrimp in hot n juicy seasoning with mild spices, and 2lbs of snow crab legs with the same seasoning and spices. Everything was seasoned well and finger licking good. The meat of the crab was so tender and juicy. I loved the atmosphere. There were no silverware or plates just plastic table cloths and napkins. The price is very reasonable. We also got a fried shrimp appetizer and 2 soft drinks and our bill was less than 70 bucks.   Two thumbs up"}
{"text":"I was a little disappointed with cost versus the amount of food.  I ordered a pound of snow crab for myself and a pound for my son. Well it was less than two pounds. The prices seem to have gone up for less food. I really like this place and the flavors are great. But I feel that for what I paid it was lacking a bit."}
{"text":"What a surprise! I had to pull over for a phone call and looked up and saw the sign! I stopped here last year when when I was here and couldn't pass up this opportunity thrown in my lap!  Once again a fantastic  meal.   Bags of boiled and seasoned seafood? How can that not be a great thing?  Had me some shrimp w/sausage and clams.   My favorite sauce is Hot n Juicy -medium spicy.    My waiter was great as well and hooked me up with a calendar   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Very Good Fun Seafood Place Just Wish They Brought Your Food Out All Together Went With My Wife And Daughter And The Brought My Daughters Food Out Then 10 min later My Wife's Food Then About Another 10 Min Later My Food Which Took Away From The Family Eating Experience Also Starting To Get Quite Expensive But The Flavor Is Wonderful"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with visit today at this joint and walked out of the restaurant. We've been coming here a lot of times, and my husband brings his own bottle of green juice. The black lady noticed it and demanded we can't have it. Considering we come here frequently and how much our bill will be, no consideration from them or anything. We'll never comeback. Blessing on disguise, we found another place Spicy Crawfish in Chinatown, which is a lot better. NEGATIVE REVIEW!!!!"}
{"text":"Better than boiling crab! The shrimp and crab legs are pretty good sizes, and they're sauces are delicious. Not too oily, and amazing flavor! The service is usually pretty hit or miss depending on how busy they are. The servers work as a team and help all the tables which is good and bad. Good because you can be helped by the server who is closest to you no matter who they are, and bad because you don't really have a set server for your table checking in on you as often. Overall, definitely a place you have to check out off the strip if you're ever in Vegas."}
{"text":"i love hot n juicy theyre bomb.com and theyre just like boiling crab except there food are smaller and a lil pricer but still good!"}
{"text":"I have been here a couple if times with my best friends and also my husband. I leave full and happy and I like how at this location it is not as crowded as the one up the road. I always order baby spice hot n juicy shrimp. I would get mild, but their definition of mild is not the same as an average person's definition. It is too spicy. And the servers can have some improvement. They are not very good at checking on tables unless I flag them down. But still good."}
{"text":"Comparable to Boiling Crab, but not quite there yet.  I've wanted to try a Hot n Juicy for a long while now and finally got to pay a visit to this location today. In all, we got 1lb shrimp, 1 order of snow crab legs, 2 sweet potato fries, and 3lbs crawfish. All of which with the Hot n Juicy spice and mild/medium spicy.  The sauce is slightly juicier than BC and the portion of sweet potato fries is smaller. However, the crawfish were tiny and overcooked. The shell was basically falling apart at my fingers and and the meat of the crawfish stuck to its shell. I'm used to bigger, better-cooked crawfish but perhaps it's because LA and San Diego are close to the ocean or crawfish farms or wherever these little critters are from?  Cocktails were $2.50 each and beers were $4.00 each!   This location is obviously pretty new. Friendly service, but they asked us if we were doing ok every five minutes and forgot to give us our lime and salt.   In all, this place is good but I wouldn't return. I am, however, looking forward to trying the other locations (Vegas one is supposed to be reallyyyy good)"}
{"text":"Location is nice but call ahead during the weekend for dinner as it can get packed quickly with groups & when your enjoying a crab/crawfish cookout, it will take some time to turn tables.   We had about 5lbs of Dungeness crab (2), a half pound of shrimp & added sausage to both. The flavorings are good with one being a bit too spicy then expected. Also had an order of Etouffee (which was excellent) that I would highly recommend.  Staff works well to help each other with radios so if you need something, they will get it for you promptly. Order some beers from tap and via the bottle and would of liked them colder, but still a good experience. Would recommend for locals and guest coming to town as a group outing."}
{"text":"I love crawfish and I had the mood for it again, it was great..the taste never changed but this time crawfish was not very fresh.., must be because the season for fresh crawfish it's ending. But in all, I love this place!"}
{"text":"Ah, Vegas. So yeah, I dined at the supremely elegant Fleur de Lys, downed steak at the trendy N9NE Steakhouse, and ate my frites at Bouchon - but nothing was quite as satisfying as rolling up my sleeves, donning a bib, and digging into a bag full of hot and juicy crawfish.   After watching the Man vs. Food Vegas edition, we decided the trek off the strip was worth it for pounds upon pounds of seafood, all seasoned with the house signature, Hot and Juicy sauce.  This is interactive dining, not for the faint-hearted. We ordered several pounds of Hot and Juicy crawfish, Hot and Juicy shrimp, king crab legs, chicken nuggets, corn& potatoes and cajun fries. While extremely inexpensive and delicious, be prepared to get down and dirty. If you can dig your beer under the mounds of crawfish and shrimp shells, take a long swig because even the mild sauce had my senses in a frenzy.  Ask for extra paper towels. 3% off your bill if you opt to pay in cash. The wait can be long but at $3 a beer, the time will pass quickly."}
{"text":"I ate here last night and wow it was very tasty. i got the pound of shrimp hot n juicy style, i told them spicy but it really didnt bring the heat until it got to my colon. At 12 bucks for a whole pound it was a good deal.   We also got the ettoufee, which if you didnt have an authentic cajun as a roomate who made the best crawfish ettoufee ever then you wouldnt know that this was mid grade. They really didnt hook it up too fat on the crawfish it was mostly just liquid and rice. They do let you add a dozen sausage peices to the steamed bag of shrimp for 4 bucks. Now these were pretty solid. They did a good job of soaking up the juice. Now the shrimp didnt really do that. I would of had to slurp the juices out of the shrimp head to get that flavor. So overall it is a pretty solid joint. It wouldnt be anything special in louisianna but for tempe arizona its not too bad. The price was solid, the food was respectable and the service was very good. Now i didnt drink last night but i saw they had 2.50 well mixed drinks. So because of its location and chicks enjoy it because they get to were bibs and gloves and take pictures and stuff. Its also very close to the amc movie theater if your trying to do that.  You could get tanked on two dollar fifty cent wells and then go out and get blasted as well. Downside is that its next to a pay as you park garage that charges 5 bucks even if you are there for a few minutes, and the restaraunt does not validate parking. So tack that on to the price you expect"}
{"text":"Hot & Juicy crawfish is a nice, tasty alternative to the bland, pricey food on the Strip. Located in Chinatown, less than 10 minutes from the Strip, this joint was also featured on Man Vs. Food. I honestly wasn't looking too forward to eating here (I'm not huuuuuuge on seafood) but my bf really was, so I manned up and we went.  We ordered 2 lbs of the Hot & Juicy special sauce + medium spice level. The waitress did warn us that their spice levels are a little higher than most places, but I thought \"Eh, it'll be fine.\" No! No! Not fine! This is liquid death! But it hurts SOOOOOOOOO good. The sauce is succulent and ridiculously flavorful. But it burns, all the way down to your soul. Oh boy does it burn. Be careful of what you order. After a while I couldn't even taste what was happening, the crawfish were so hot. I recommend getting a side dish (we got rice) to help soak up the heat, it really helps. It also is awesome that they offer free refills on your drinks, because trust me, you TOTALLY need it. After every bite I needed a huge gulp of cold liquid.  Oh, and after you eat here, make sure you're going to be very close to a toilet for the next couple of hours. Oh! And if you pay in cash, you get 3% off!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the customer service we had here. I believe the guys name was Mark, he was very informative and really friendly. The food was good too! Have ate at similar places before that usually are just whole in the walls but this place looked nicer than expected in the inside. Also the price was great for all we got. Definitely recommend trying it out."}
{"text":"If your local and you love seafood and you haven't been here? Then what are you doing with your life?   Anyways another family favorite!  Unfortunately, they only have a 4 star rating but as far as food ratings then it deserves the maximum 5 stars. The customer service is the reason they can't reach that. We've been coming here for years. We usually always come to the original location. They have one on South Eastern and their other two locations are on Spring Mountain. They have opened multiple locations out of state as well. Back when they took pictures of you with their Polaroid camera and stuck your photo on the wall.   For most people it's either hot and juicy or boiling crab.   Hot n Juicy!!!   1)If it's your first time here becareful with the level of spiciness because your toilet might hold you hostage by making you pay   2)You have to try the hot n juicy special which is a mix of all their flavored   3) Ask for gloves   4) Be prepared to smell like the restaurant for the rest of your day  5) An odd tip, but use lemons to wipe your hands down with; it helps with the smell   6) Their shrimp makes the best leftover mini sandwiches for the win   7) Crab legs are my favorite thing to order.   8) n corn  9) n Cajun fries  10) n lemon juice"}
{"text":"Loved this place!  Whole different experience eating crawfish and crab. They not only give you bibs but plastic gloves too which I highly recommend. We ordered the garlic and butter sauce but it was so much more than just garlic and butter!!!  I cannot do the many flavors going on in the sauce justice. I rarely go to the same place twice while on vacation but will absolutely be going back again before we leave!  Very casual, food brought out in plastic bags which you eat with your hands."}

{"text":"The food was great here! The seasoning was just where it needed to be- i first had an appetizer of oyster which were very good- the oyster were a great size and the food came out fast. It was very busy but the timing of the food was on point. For the meal I ordered shrimp and crab legs - 1lb spicy with hot and juicy mix. The flavor was perfect!! Perfect seasoning perfect spice!! I just came from the island of Hawaii where seafood was amazing and to find a place here that taste just as good was perfect! I would recommend this place to anyone that wanted crab legs in the desert!! They were extremely busy but the waitress were very attentive and very nice. Great place I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Stopped here for the first time the other day and was pleased. Love the concept of peel and eat seafood served sauced up in plastic bags by the pound. Although the seafood in the desert can be somewhat small, the shrimp and crawfish we had were full of fresh flavor. After tying on our complimentary - and much needed - plastic bibs, we tried the hot n juicy (our favorite thus far), Louisiana style, and lemon pepper seasonings, but there are a number of others you can try, as well, along with setting your own spice level. Your server will also ask if you want salt and pepper, gloves, and lemons. Don't be afraid to crank up the heat...but do be prepared to leave garlicky!  Although there aren't many side options (rolls, short cobs of mushy corn that mostly serve to absorb sauce, potatoes, and a few others), there are a lot of good local beers on draught to wash down all that seafood. Our servers, who were all friendly and attentive, made sure to check that our pint glasses never ran empty. Definitely prepare to work hard for your food here - don't be in a rush and expect to leave messy! But enjoy the experience. It may not be the best seafood you'll ever eat, but it sure is fun."}
{"text":"Shrimp, crawfish, potato fries, sweet potato fries, corn, sausages, EVERYTHING was heavenly. Such a pleasant surprise to find such delicious/fresh/juicy food off the Strip!  A+++ for the phenomenal staff. Thank you for being so friendly and attentive!!  Hot 'N Juicy of Nevada (WIN!)  vs.  Boiling Crab of California (pfffffft.)"}
{"text":"Much, much credit to Hot 'N Juicy for getting the peppery Cajun ideal right. Too many restaurants label something Cajun and then bring out Creole, or vice versa. Hot 'N Juicy gets it right.  This is a very casual restaurant. Thin plastic table covers and the big roll of paper towels on each table are a very smart way of handling the mess left behind after handling and eating their bags of food. Yes, bags. Crawfish and shrimp and crab are offered by the pound and everything is served in plastic bags with their own spice and butter. Ordering more is simple: the service is attentive and enthusiastic.  My highest rec is for the shrimp. They're huge and easy to peel. The crawfish are on the small side, and the crab are a lot of work for a little benefit. They do also have sausage, served cut in big pieces. I was lucky to visit with about a dozen people and no one had any complaints with anything they tried.  Our table also looked like the remains of some Roman feast when we were done. Caesars Palace eat your heart out."}
{"text":"Never having gone to the first HnJ, my brother, Katrina M., and Aziz B. decided to avoid the hoopla of the original, and head towards the second location. The interior was open and modern. Service was a bit slow, and at times, left us fending for ourselves in pursuit of bibs and gloves.  As for food, we ordered a pound of the Hot N Juicy special, spicy crawfish with sausage, two pounds of the HnJ special, extra spicy shrimp - both with corn and potatoes - as well as some fried shrimp. The seafood were around $11, fluctuating according to market price. Corn was .75 cents, potatoes .60, and sausage 2.75 for half a dozen. For the four of us, we were shed blood, sweat, and tears from the meal (perhaps not the first, but you get the picture). When they say Extra Spicy, they mean it. But the crawfish was good as a commodity (necessary for a first time). The shrimp though? That's where it's at. Succulent, packed with flavor - those babies were my favorite. As for its fried counterpart, the cornmeal breading was a bit overbearing and fully encompassing. It didn't stop us from devouring it as refuge from the spiciness of Extra Spicy. For about 60 dollars, this was more than enough among the four of us.  I love the idea around HnJ - communal and casual eats. Good food around people who love you despite your barbaric eating habits. As for the technicalities of a restaurant, service could be better. But I don't expect much from a place with plastic tablecloths."}
{"text":"Very fresh and delicious sea food!!  The crawfish, shrimp and crab were great!  Attentive wait staff, food also came out quickly.  The Juicy Cajun seasoning is amazing!!  We'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered a soft shell crab basket (8) with Cajun fries and a calamari appetizer totaling $25.76, only to be completely underwhelmed by the food. I arrived exactly 15 minutes after placing the order, which is what time they said it would be ready.  1) All of my food was room temperature when I got there. Had you told me it would be ready sooner, I would have been there.  2) My 8pc soft shell crab basket only had 6 pieces. (Maybe someone needed a snack)  3) I was told I was receiving tartar sauce, ketchup, and cocktail sauce, but instead, received marinara, which is fine too but it would be nice to know what to expect. The same with the ketchup. It would've been nice to know that it was SPICY before hand.  All in all this was my first time in this restaurant, which should've been a dead giveaway by all of the questions I asked about the menu.  Therefore, it would've been nice to have a little more guidance in the first-time Customer experience."}
{"text":"This was the hot n juicy 2 which was off the strip in Vegas. We first went to the original one and saw the line was too long so we came to this one which I met up with some other people. I ordered 2lbs of the spicy garlic butter and calimari. My friend ordered the 4lbs of extra spicy lousiana style which he shared with his gf. The spicy garlic butter was amazing, it was not too spicy and not too garlicy flavored. The extra spicy was really spicy but still enjoyable. My friend mentioned that the garlic butter he had in the DC location had too much garlic that it was not too appetizing.  When I pointed out that the owner was there, we mentioned it to him and he was really cool about and appreciated our feed back. Hope the cooks in DC gets more training because I look forward in eating at that location."}
{"text":"Get ready to use your hands! Great food and good service! Reasonably priced! Bibs and gloves provided to keep you clean and fresh! Crawfish and shrimp are a must try! I got the hot n juicy medium sauce, it was spicy! FYI I like spicy, I'm not a lightweight lol"}
{"text":"I finally got to check this place out for my birthday. I'm from New Orleans so I've been craving some good crawfish and peel n eat shrimp. If I rated this just on food I'd give it 4 stars. I ordered a pond of shrimp, crawfish and blue crab with cajun spice at the spicey level. Spicy wasn't too hot, I could have gone to the top level. The shrimp and crawfish were excellent, fresh, a good amount. Crab wasn't the best deal, just two in a pound but I figured that.  What could have been better... ambiance is just OK. Maybe a few more booths and a little more space between tables. Needed some baskets for discards so we didn't have to dig through our old stuff in the bags. Service was a bit slow but it was a busy Mother's day Sunday.  I'll go back again just for the shrimp and crawfish and try the extra spicy."}
{"text":"Their hot and juicy sauce is perfection! Be prepared to drink water like a fish for the rest of the day though."}
{"text":"Had a craving for good crawfish so stopped by here for dinner.  I didn't have to wait long for a table for 2.  Our waitress greeted us right away and took our order.  I ordered 2 lbs of non spicy Hot n Juicy special.  Came out pretty quickly so that's a plus.  I guess if you in Vegas, then this is probably the place to go to.  Fortunately, back in VA, we have something similar to this place and the sauces are a little bit better IMO.  Overall, great crawfish and service here.  Will come back next time I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"Let's just say I had to order it to go recently as I had a craving! Love this place as they never disappoint. The staff is always friendly and very knowledgeable in regards to the menu options! Only thing I'd caution is how small the parking lot is.... other than that 5***** !!"}
{"text":"My friends Chris, Lee and Favi took me here for a bon voyage dinner.  We chose this because parking is easier and wait isn't as long.  I'll cut to the chase on this review.  Service was good and attentive.  When you have to call for a server, they're right there immediately.  The shrimp and crabs were cooked to perfection as always.  The only reason why I gave it a lower star is because the sauces tasted different.  We ordered mild spice on the sauce but it tasted like it was prepared medium.  Not sure if this is the server's but I could barely taste my food because it was too spicy for me.    Overall, I'll keep coming back just because it's part of Vegas and the shellfishes are always cooked right.  I'll just have to make sure to order sauce that is less than mild... maybe they'll do it light for me.  ;)"}
{"text":"I'm still amazed with this place even for the second time.  The shrimp is so juicy and the crawfish, as long as you only eat the tail, is bomb!  The combination of butter with garlic and spices just gives it the kick it needs.  Best if you come here with someone.  This isn't the place to come by yourself.    My friend suggested using gloves because the shrimp smell will stay in your hands for a week.  I just thought using gloves was too weird but I did it anyway and I will now use them every time I'm here.  My hands even today is shrimp smelling free."}
{"text":"I'm a Seafood lover so I enjoy coming here. I usually order the snow crab, muscles, corn, and fries all of which are delicious. I love the seasoning they use on their food and I dip it in butter as well lol. After finishing you may smell like garlic for a while but it's worth it! Lol"}
{"text":"shrimp and crab legs in their spicy Hot and Juicy sauce make me go back over and over. And yes, I stink for days, but who cares?!? lol"}
{"text":"I like this hot and juicy location. I feel that it's new and everything is clean inside and the seating is much better than the spring mountain location. The food is great which is pretty much the same as boiling crab. Just be prepared to get messy when you come here and you might want to wear something you don't care getting dirty."}
{"text":"I got off work and this was the closest Hot N Juicy to me.  I was nervous since this is the only location on the strip and thought it would be super busy.  It wasn't to crowded and I was able to walk right in, make a order and get it to go within 10 minutes.   I got the bag of shrimp and a side of the sausage.  All Hot n Juicy xxl spicy style.  It's was a great meal and I really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Came to this location for the 1st time.  Usually go to the original spot on Spring Mtn.  This new spot is much bigger, cleaner and quick service.  We always get the 1lb of shrimp (hot n juicy style eXXXtra spicy).  The food is always great, service is great and the prices are as expected for a seafood spot."}
{"text":"Alriiiiiiight Hot N Juicy- this location definitely made me rethink how I feel about your restaurant.  I had been going to the other location on Spring Mountain for years and one bad experience sent me packing. But this location has changed my mind about your food for the better.  I came here with a couple of friends for a late lunch on a Sunday. They were a bit busy but thankfully we got seated right away. Since they walked us to a table in the back of the restaurant, I was able to get a good look around. It was nice to see that they keep everything clean. Considering the waiters are also the bussers, that says a lot. The staff definitely stays on top of their sections!  Once we were sat we were given bibs and menus right away and we were asked what beverages we wanted. Quick service for sure! That's always nice. Loren was our main waitress and she made sure that we got exactly what we ordered. She also stayed on top of making sure our food was coming out. Overall awesome waitress!!  I can't remember what everyone ordered but I personally ordered one pound of crawfish with juicy Cajun medium and a pound of snow crab with lemon pepper medium. While the flavors were amazing and everything was cooked perfectly, the heat wasn't quite there for me. Loren definitely changed that. She got me a side of spicy sauce so I could add it to my food. Still wasn't hot enough for me. So she made sure they really kicked it up a notch and got me the extra spicy. The heat still wasn't there but she warned me it'd come as I kept eating it. Thank you for the warning, you saved me from having a stomach ulcer!  Once that heat kicked in it was over. Definitely satisfying though!!  Everyone seemed to enjoy their food and time here at Hot N Juicy. The vibes were great and the food was greater, so we'll definitely be back to enjoy more!"}
{"text":"We decided to try Hot N Juicy for the first time... I enjoyed the experience, however, we thought the prices were kinda high. It was $50 for a 1lb of shrimp, 1lb of crawfish, 1lb crab and a small basket of calamari. There were 2 of us and we left still hungry.  The seasoning on the food was great but, next time when we wanna spend 70 dollars on a meal we are going somewhere where the seafood is already prepared and de-shelled. The service was mediocre. Nothing special.   All in all again it was a good experience but not worth the money and probably will not be back."}
{"text":"This place is a lot of fun and the food is delicious. We ordered a pound each of crawfish and mussels as well as two fried baskets -catfish and soft shell crab. For the boiled seafood you choose seasonings and spiciness. We chose mild (as a compromise) and it still had a nice kick.    The interesting thing here is eating without utensils. You wear plastic bibs and where plastic gloves and pick up your food from the plastic bags break it apart and eat.  The crawfish are truly juicy and delicious and the other items were tasty as well.  I would definitely recommend this place when you are looking for something different from the standard fare.  A very fun experience."}
{"text":"We ordered 1lb clams, 1lb crawfish,  1lb snow crabs and not a drop left. They were seasoned with their \"everything \"spice and that was out of the park delicious. Wish they cooked the potatoes a little more and possibly serve garlic bread but other than that this place is a must go to."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place.   The hostess and all the servers were absolutely amazing.  Smiles on their faces when things were not easy.  Truly a pleasure to be there and watch how well they all worked with each other.   AND the food!!!!  Some of the best flavors!  Absolutely worth the wait, the craziness, the small parking lot!!!!! It was so yummy!!!!!"}
{"text":"What a terrible Mother's Day for my wife. It was her 1st Mother's Day and she wanted shellfish now that she can finally eat it. I had a great idea to go here because what I saw on FB, huge crawfish and crabs, lobster, and what a bad choice I made. Nothing like the pictures online. I will say the calamari was wonderful but the Crawfish were the size of my Flippin thumbnail. I took pictures check them out I'll post em. So it is what it is and the server was embarrassed and apologized over and over and it's not his fault. He thought they should be taken off the bill and I agreed since we barley ate the 2 or 3 pounds we ordered. Left most of them on the table and I have photos of that also. So our server (who was awesome) insisted the manager to come over  to check them out after she said no discount to him. So no wanting to she came over.  She saw them and said okay I'll take care it if for you I apologize for that them being tiny. So we order more calamari and shrimp. This is about after and hour. So 30 minutes go by and the calamari finally come out....not even hot. We were hungry so we ate them and also because they are good. 30 min later the shrimp hasn't even made it out yet. So now we are there for two hours and had a little shrimp we started with and two orders or calamari. So we decided to give our card to our server and ask for the shrimp to be bagged up Togo because we still did not get them.i saw he was frustrated for us as we were.  Our card came out and still no shrimp and the bill was outstandingly high at $87.... For what!!!? So our server looked at it and said oh crap she didn't adjust it I'm sorry. So the manager came out and she said \"I did adjust the bill\". I said $87 for 1lb of shrimp, calamari, and two beers!!!? She said \" I took off 10%\" I said huh? 10% off so the bill was about $95 for what!? Are you kidding me? She said \"well you liked the flavor right?\" I was speechless. She acted like a jerk telling me to stop interrupting her and let her talk and explain. I said there is nothing to explain even with seeing most of the crawfish was still on the table and not even touched.....Ohhh and the size of a almond. IM NOT JOKING check the photos. She said again \"well you ate some and like the flavor right?\" I said let me get this straight you want me to pay $60 for crawfish the size of a peanut and we did not eat even 1/3 of?! She walked away!!! We had an outside table next to the entrance and people saw us talking to the manager and they also saw the size of the crawfish even how she (manager) acted. The people said to us are they making you pay for those!!? I said looks like it. A party of 5 left and a couple (husband and wife) walked over and asked to see the crawfish. I said no problem. They were shocked they were so tiny....then replied that manager acted that way knowing you guys have 2 lbs sitting in the table and wants you to pay for that!!!? Yup I said. They looked at each other and shook their heads and walked out of line. Told us thanks for showing them and said they are going elsewhere, I said probably a good idea. The Manger didn't come back nor would she give us an itemized receipt of our lunch. She might have the worst attitude and managerial skills I've ever seen. Then the server came back with our check with cash but we paid for it with a card. She gave us cash back he said because she already ran our card knowing we were unhappy and wanted to talk with her. Anyone ever heard of that!? Lol. I apologized for to my wife and we are going to celebrate Mother's Day again tonight or tomorrow night. Even if they got in crawfish the size of a football I will never go back just because it that woman's attitude. HORRIBLE and the IQ of a door nail. Clean it up Hot N juicy MINI Crawfish."}
{"text":"After a short wait, our party of 8 was seated in the center of the dining room.  Bibs were passed around the table and the rolls of napkins teared to create \"dams\"  to prevent the juicy liquids from trickling onto our clothes. Disposable gloves were also provided, if you didn't want to get your hands messy.   Lime, salt and pepper was provided if you wanted to make a dipping sauce or use it to clean the fishy stench off your hands post meal.   Although the menu was basic, it was quite overwhelming to decide what seafood options to order.  Pretty much, the seafood choices are crabs, king crab, snow crab legs, lobster, clams, shrimp and crawfish.  Once you settle on your seafood choice, you pick a seasoning then pick a spice level.  Seasonings include Louisiana, Juicy Cajun, garlic butter, lemon pepper and the famous \"Hot N Juicy\" Special.  The server warned us that their spice level is above average and to choose a level beneath what you think you could handle ( I should have listened)!  We snacked on some fried corn fritters as we eagerly waited for our seafood feast.  If shellfish isn't your thing, there were also a few options for fish, chicken, calamari, etouffee, etc. One of the girls was allergic so she went with the fried catfish basket with seasoned fries.   To our disappointment, they ran out of fresh crawfish so we went with 2 orders of 2 pound frozen crawfish.  Although they were cheaper, some of the girls noticed the difference.  Each order came arrived at the table double bagged smothered in the special seasoning blend.  For every 2 lbs of crawfish, one corn and one potato was thrown in the mixture.  Our table pretty much ordered everything.  There were steamed clams, lots of shrimp, crab legs along with a few sides of rice and fries.  Yup, I should have listed to the server. My clams were super hot! Those were my favorite.  It was a good burning sensation but I knew I would pay later.  The head-on shrimp came 2nd. I'd tear off the head, suck it then remove the shell from the body.  Some were bigger than others but they were all good.  I did the same with the crawfish but they proved to be a bit more difficult and time consuming to eat.   I kept dipping the mild shrimp and crawfish into my sauce to make it even more spicy.  I was so excited, I couldn't stop tearing the shells of the shrimp and plopping it into my mouth with my dirty gloved hands.  At one point, it was so filthy that I had to change my gloves.  By this time, sweat was dripping down my face and I kept having to wipe it.  My cheeks were on fire form the combination of SPICY Hot N Juicy sauce and sweat. Despite all this, I kept on going. We had to finish.  I thought we were done and I went to go wash my hands.  The seafood stench still lingered on my hands even though I used lime and washed it with soap two times. It was that bad. My nails must have poked through the flimsy gloves, or maybe the shrimp of the head.  After I cleaned up as much as I could, I returned back to the table to find out that we still had more shrimp left.  I just couldn't do it.   With gratuity and tax, we averaged about $30.00 per person. Not bad at all for all that food!  The meal was a fantastic dining experience.  From the plastic bibs and gloves to the buckets of trash lined on our table. it was definitely a must try meal.  I would recommend this \"no frills\" place to everyone.   My only change would to NOT ORDER the \"SPICY\" level.... it leaves for a VERY UNPLEASANT NIGHT."}
{"text":"Yay! I finally got to have the hot-n-juicy experience.  It took years and family visiting from out of town to go.  I could never get the place to appeal to the hubby.  He was never thrilled with the idea of eating from a bag and leaving the shells on the table.  He's not big into making a mess, but me on the other hand...the dirty just makes it taste better, right?!  So I went with my mom, cousin, and his wife.  I was excited because I've heard so much about this place and the yelpers can't help but to rave.  Between us all we ordered the 2 pounds of shrimp, 2 pounds of snow crab legs (both hot n juicy special, mild), 2 orders of calamari, a basket of chicken, and an order of fries.    I zeroed in on the seafood, I didn't take all this time to get here to eat chicken!!  My mom freaked out a bit about shrimp with heads and made me pull them off for her (this is why no crawfish...no sucking heads for us that day!)  But she did eventually get over it and was able to take of the heads herself without being grossed out.  Everything tasted really good, just a bit of a kick that didn't overwhelm (enough of a kick for me, I'm a pussy when it comes to spicy).  I don't even remember how many paper towels I personally went through but I'm glad there was an unlimited number of them.  I think the family enjoyed the experience, but when my mom discovered they had plastic gloves after our meal she was disappointed her hands smelt like garlic and seafood.  I just asked the waitress for some lemons for our hands then went and washed them in the bathroom...good as new.  But my dog has that super sonic smell going on and couldn't get over how yummy my hands were!  I'm quite the happy fat-n-preggers girl after this experience.  Baby was definitely happy with all the yummy goodness I fed her.  Now that I know they have some pansy plastic gloves for the hubby I think I've got a better chance to get him to come with me for a return trip.  He's also a sucker for anywhere that serves sweet potato fries. :o)"}
{"text":"Highly recommended , but it was okay. Decor was nice. Staff was nice .. Just OK .. Nothing to write home about . food was okay . they DONT serve hard liquor or mixed drinks so that was a bummer. Would I go back? Prob not. The seafood is the draw ."}
{"text":"Ordered $100 amount of food to go: 1 lbs of clams, 1 order of King Crab Legs, 2 lbs of shrimp, and 1 lbs of crawfish. We got home right away (like 10 minutes from the restaurant) and found that most items were overcooked: clams were rubbery & shrimp and crab was mushy and stuck to the shell. And everything tastes like a cup of salt was poured into the seasoning. The only thing that seemed okay to eat was the crawfish."}
{"text":"I heard so many great things about this place, after trying it out it was mediocre. The service was lousy, and the food was just ok. I wouldn't recommend it. If you've ever been to a real crawfish broil avoid this place. The best thing about this place was the size of the shrimp, but it's like hot without flavor. The waitresses kept forgetting to bring out our drinks, then we received the wrong drinks, forgot our lemons after asking twice. There's too many good restaurants in Vegas to waste money here."}
{"text":"This place is right there off of Mill Ave. Let me say....If it lasts 1 year....wow. This place sucked. The service was lame....for example....The manager talking on some stupid headset to her employee who was 10 feet away.   All I had was calamari, it was flat out gross. Lots of fried stuff except for crawfish. I dunno.....As of today I have no plan on ever returning.....  Sad.....I wanted a nice seafood type place in that area....lunch at PF Changs can be crazy sometimes."}
{"text":"Food is good and I enjoy the Hot N Juicy with my shrimp. Food is always fresh and the atmosphere is good. The selection is always the same and I like the consistency. They go by market price for seafood items and it's usually the same whenever I ask for my check. Hop on into one of these restaurants and get your seafood fix!"}
{"text":"This restaurant had a really comfortable vibe to it. The wait wasn't long and my girlfriend and I were seated comfortably. The menu is easy to understand, and our server was nice and knowledgeable of the menu. My food arrived in a speedy time. My girlfriend's food took 3x as long to arrive. We both ordered shrimp by the pound and even ordered seconds! The prices are reasonable! The only thing besides the slow service for her food; is the bathroom was really gross. It was dirty and both toilets were flooded. Also, the sinks were sticky to touch and the drying tissue was low quality. Besides that, the food was good, the atmosphere was relaxing, and I had a good experience while eating here. I'll be coming back!"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum! Still reading this passed my snazzy expression, then stop and continue after you've eaten here yourself! The food is off the wall amazing! Fresh and inexpensive!!! I like the bibs and I asked my server for a pen to write funny names on my bib! Service was great and the entire spot was clean. My table wasn't sticky!!! I love that.  Pros: Delicious and fresh seafood, payment was easy, bathrooms clean, appealing decor  Cons: No wifi, food took a while to reach the table  Overall: Fun and casual spot to wine and dine yourself or a friend! I'm happy, be back soon! There's more to eat!"}
{"text":"Excited to see there's a location right by the strip. I usually had to hop a ride to visit, but now can walk. This place sits on the side street by Planet Hollywood.  True to HnJ style, the food was great. I went with the crab legs with medium garlic butter flavor, a corn, a potato and a side of rolls. The medium was a little spicier than I remembered, but still very good. One of my friends went with the shrimp, mild and my other friend has a shrimp and crab combo spicy. We were all satisfied with our meals and service was friendly and very prompt. Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Love, love seafood and love, love this place! We always get the same thing because why fix something if it ain't broken right?! We get the \"Get Your Feet Wet\" it comes with  1 lb Crawfish, 1 lb Shrimp, dozen Andouille Sausages,  2  Corns and 2 Potatoes. I'm not to fauns of the sausage. I've had better and that's the only negative thing I'll say. I like the Louisiana tasting spicy sausages more. Most of the time the crawfish are good size (medium) somedays we go they are small.l but I believe it depends on the seasons... the flavor we love is the hot and juicy mid cause although we love spicy trust me... mild isn't mild! Mild to us is more like level one spicy. We've tried the hot and it was too spicy and again we like spicy but not to where you can't enjoy you food. The flavor \"hot n juicy\" is amazing because it's like a burst of flavors all melted in your mouth. My mouths getting watery just writing this review lol. Love lots of lemon on the side which they aren't stingy about. The atmosphere is chill. We typically go on Saturday nights and it's a more younger/college crowd however you do see some families as well. It's a mix I guess you can say. They have loud top 40's music in the back and I can recall one night they had some uncensored music which maybe because it was already late and not family environment. Music is loud but not too loud where you can't hear one another.   I love how it's not all fancy and you don't need to worry about getting dirty cause it's gonna get messy but it's worth it. The staff are nice and friendly. Place is clean. The food comes out fast and is always fresh. This place hits the spot! The only down side is that parking is a bit of a hassle as it's in the theater area/club area but that has nothing to do with the restaurants awesomeness! You gotta try it you won't be disappointed :)"}
{"text":"Amazing service and delicious food!! It was my first time and our server Viktoriya was amazing! Can't wait to go back Highly suggest shrimp with  hot n juicy sauce!!"}
{"text":"Did not enjoy my experience here. The crawfish were not very large. Moreover, it took quite a long time to be greeted at the front. Would not go back."}
{"text":"We arrived at 7:45 on Friday evening for dinner for a party of 20. My husband and I were the first to arrive. We were sitting at the bar for a least a few minutes, completely ignored by a \"team lead\" before someone finally took our order. The bar area is really small with seating for only five, so they were in a hurry to cash us out from the bar before we even received the appetizer we ordered. Hubby ordered a peach ale which still hadn't arrived 10 mins after ordering since they needed to change out the tap - I appreciate they told us at least, but it would have been nice for them to get a move on! We received it after asking again. Cheese sticks were average. I asked for more sauce and received it quickly. This place obviously hasn't been open long - they're still figuring things out, working out the kinks. Another woman at the bar said the place should be twice the size - like they underestimated demand. Of course that's how it looks on a Friday night, but this is in July when everyone evacuates the valley so I can only imagine what this place will look like in November or (God help them) March.   All of the above would have been mostly excusable if the food were good... but it wasn't. Even mild was way too spicy for us to eat. And I'm not the only wimp - so are all my Asian and Hispanic friends. Time to eat some cereal at home... Also, plan to work really, really hard just to get a tiny bit of crawfish. Not nearly enough payoff for the effort. And they did NOT validate parking, so we had to spend an additional $12 on that. And then more for dry cleaning our clothes... Even if you aren't a messy eater, the person across from you will get you covered with sauce. I asked the waitress how to get it out of my clothes, and she said that's why she always just wears black... thanks (not)."}
{"text":"2 parts to the review..  First comes to the actual experience my group of 7 and I had. The second is how Noemy Avalos, the amazing manager took care of the matter.  We began on a positive note when our male server took our drink order and explained thoroughly about the process of ordering from the menu. He was very polite, patient, and knowledgeable. Once our drinks were delivered, we had a new server, Natali. After she took our orders, our experience quickly became negative, as our food orders were all mixed up and half the food came out much later than the rest. Natali was kind enough to take off 2 items off our bill that took over an hour to arrive. We were already in a rush to catch a show, and we decided to settle up as quickly as possible.   When Natali delivered the bill, there were items that were added that weren't ordered. We had to explain that these extra charges were in fact not ours. She brought a new bill out, without explaining the automatic 17%  gratuity that was added. Because of the amount of time spent waiting for food, we decided to settle using 1 visa card, and worried about splitting the charges within the group afterwards since we were out of time.  Due to the rush, we tipped an extra $50 on top of the automatic gratuity, which was NOT deserved. While signing the receipt at the cashier, Natali should of mentioned that tip was already included. We understand that we should've spent a bit more time reading over the bill, but with 8 people rushing to catch a show, we weren't fully able to analyze the receipt.   We let Noemy Avalos know of this matter, and she not only decided to give back the $50, but she offered to refund the entire tip $100+ back. Amazing manager, and a pleasure to talk with.  We will return, when we come back to Vegas for EDC 2014. :)"}
{"text":"Wow, this place has some good food!  very flavorful and tasty.  Anytime I go to vegas, this is a must stop destination to eat it.  Ive been here many times and its always satisfies my cravings."}
{"text":"Food was alright at best, but it took a whole hour to get my fries, shrimp and calamari. Well I actually never got the calamari. They then informed me they removed it from the bill... Well thank you?!? And small basket of sweet potato fries (drum roll please) 6.99. Then they ran out of validation tickets so after they took two hours to disburse our food we paid 4.00/hour. Probably not coming here anymore"}
{"text":"Alex was our server and Valentina was the manager on duty when we went to Hot n Juicy. They both accommodated us very well and of course, the food was delicious! We especially loved the green mussels and shrimps with the Cajun seasoning."}
{"text":"Bomb!!!!! Always yummy & usually they get the orders 100% right for take out. I love the bags of lemons they give to go."}
{"text":"This was my second time to Hot & Juicy. I was NOT disappointed at all!  Since I live in Henderson I was extremely excited to try this location out. This location was not nearly as crowded as the other 2 locations (although soon I'm sure it will be).   I took a coworker with me, it was a first for him and I'm sure this will be a new lunch spot for us...here's why:  Close to work...'nuff said.  I went with my usual...1lb of Snow Crab, 1lb of Shrimp (with Corn and Andouille)  I usually do the Hot & Juicy sauce and get this XXTRA Spicy...I got the Shrimp this way  but the AMAZING waitress, Molly recommended the Lemon Pepper for the Snow Crab. I'm glad that I took her advice!! We also got a side of lemon and pepper on the side.   The food was good as usual but the service here was key!! We were not rushed, beers refilled quickly and she even held a Shrimp seminar for my Hot & Juicy first timer friend which was really cool!! I will definitely be back!!  I will probably try some new things every time I go back but the one thing that I WILL NOT change is where I sat. Molly is the best!!  Seafood, beer, Molly, Seafood, beer, Molly....LOVE THIS PLAY!!  SERVED BY MOLLY AND I'M SWEATIN' ...WHOOOO!!"}
{"text":"The seafood tasted just like the name of restaurant. Hot and juicy! Lucky we arrived just after 6pm and there's no wait. The waiters were friendly. Food came out fast and YUMMY! We ordered the Drool. It had crawfish and shrimps not bad for starters like me. Will definitely come back if I visit Vegas again!"}
{"text":"After a long day of walking and shopping, we were hungry for some crawfish.  And thanks to yelp, we found a winner in Vegas!  This place truly lives up to their name.  We ordered two pounds of shrimp and two pounds of crawfish...all medium spiciness with garlic butter seasoning.  We should've ordered a pound with different seasoning and heat....to test our taste buds.  I'm eyeing the Hot n Juicy Special and Lemon Pepper seasonings for my next visit.  I think the garlic butter had more garlic than butter....extremely potent!    The crawfish was very spicy at medium...but we loved it.  Some of these crustaceans were larger in size than at most places I've gone to.  The shrimp was my favorite though.  Same spices as the crawfish, but more juicy and meaty.  We also ordered sausage, corn, and Cajun fries...which were all just okay for me.    Customer service was top notch here...I just wish they were open later than 10 pm.    We learned that the Man vs. Food show will be taping at this restaurant.  With their hot n juicy menu, it's evident why this place will be premiered."}
{"text":"Love eating here. It's worth the wait. Advice call them a head how long the wait so you wouldn't be surprise when u get there. They have 2 location so call both and chose which one you prefers."}
{"text":"Here on Vacation from Nashville. All of my friends recommend this place. So you know I had to come see what all the HYPE was about. This place was nice and cozy. When you first walk in you feel really relaxed. The food was really good. I find it to be a bit away over priced. I guess because it \"VEGAS PRICE\"! However I find it really ridiculous $14.00 for one pound of crawfish. But not complaining. Over all it's good. Nice to get out of the casinos. Servers are really friendly. We got the combination of The Drool. Came with one pound of crawfish. Shrimp, Crab Legs, Corns, Potatoes, & Sausages. And others items I may have left out. I don't find it weird that they give you the food in a plastic bag. But then again it's finger food!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty legit. Great food and decent brews for the most part. The prices can get a little steep but hey it's seafood and damn good seafood at that. I recommend trying this place out. It's worth the trip and then some."}
{"text":"We've been going to Crab Corner and I wanted something with less deep fried food.  We decided to try this place as our grand daughter was turning 7 and requested crab for her birthday dinner.  We didn't know what to expect but we were very pleasantly surprised.  The place was squeaky clean.  The wait staff was friendly and efficient.  The food? Amazing.  The birthday girl had a pound of crab legs and asked for more.  We each ate the pound of crab legs plus a pound of shrimp.  The sauces and seasonings were delicious.  The corn fritters were great.  Hubby, who is not a big seafood fan, will eat fried shrimp and these were great.  Our one regret was having show tickets and having to leave the restaurant when what we all really wanted to do was order another round of crab for everyone.  This is the new must-do when our son's family comes out to visit."}
{"text":"Camille is very nice, we got here for the first time and she made us very comfortable and gave us free crawfish sample.  Surely be back again here.."}
{"text":"Definately better than Boiling Crab, Kickin' Cajun, & Cajun King back in Hawaii. They make the shrimp way more juicier and with more of a kick to its taste. I was in crawfish heaven. Lol. We had a party of 4 and ordred 3 pounds of shrimp, hot, spicy and mild with butter. I probably ate most of the mild with buttershrimp because I love butter with my seafood. My boyfriend, his brother and his cousin mostly ate the hot and spicy shrimp. I tried the hot and spicy shrimp; it wasn't that hot, but I think the aftertaste got me. Haha. We also got side orders of rice just to keep the spicyness to a level. The corn in the bag was also amazing to its taste! I've never ate such a juicy corn smuthered in mild sauce before. By the time the bag was almost gone, I was really full. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"Its great that there's finally a Hot n Juicy here. We came on a Saturday before the lines hit. Service was good, food took forever! However they did just open an the cooks are getting familiar. I will probably re-rate this in a month but for now I don't think waiting 1 1/2hrs for 2 Dungeness crabs is acceptable. Even if your an inexperience cook! The sauce was a little different from the Hot n Juicy's we go to when we are in Vegas,  At the end they did take care of us ( Thank you Nickyjo! ) and apologized a lot. And because of that we will definitely try again in a month.  Overall food was fresh and good."}
{"text":"Yummy Crawfish with friend after long work day. Relaxing my mind with spicy & sour. Oysters best choice for me. Delicious place for crawfish here"}
{"text":"Went in for Fathers day. What a dissapointment the staff was very friendly. We had a 45 min wait which is not bad. Being my first time there not sure what to expect. We ordered the crawfish, king crab and lobster.  They were all over cooked, problem is when shellfish is over cooked it becomes rubbery and extra chewy. The lobster was the worst I should have complained I only took one bite and could take no more. The table was cramped and falling apart. I should have read the reviews but we live and learn. This place could be amazing on just the crawfish..."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place. The food is amazing and the staff is great. You must try the garlic shrimp. YUMM!!!!!"}
{"text":"From the outside, the restaurant seems a little misplaced, but once you walk in, the environment is so inviting and feels like a place to have a good time.   Got some blue moons for $3 each, which is a pretty good price if you ask me. I came with 8 other people so we ordered a whole lot of shrimps and crawfishes. Got 2 lbs of the hotnjuicy special crawfish and 2 lbs of garlic butter shrimp, 2 lbs of lemon pepper shrimp, 1 lb of louisiana style shrimp, 2 orders of sweet potato fries, 1 order of cajun fries, and some rice. The bibs and gloves they provide are very handy, and you should change your gloves once or twice during your eating period because the sauces definitely leak through and you'll be stuck smelling like cajun for a few hours or days after. The crawfish were a bit of a struggle for me to break into, but the sauce did it for me, so good and with a kick (my lips were for sure burning way after finishing eating). We started taking shots of balls of rice with the different sauces on top, DELISH! The shrimps had a significant amount more meat than the crawfish an were easier to peel. The cajun fries order got lost somewhere during the meal, but they were pretty nice about getting the order to us as fast as possible.   This place is definitely worth trying and won't break the bank!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! At least 3 Sundays out the month my friends and I gather here for shrimp, snow crab and king crab! We always add a side of rice and fries. My favorite sauces are the lemon pepper and garlic butter HOT! We have tried the corn fritters but I really don't care for them.   I would like to make something clear this place gets 5 stars for the FOOD! The service here absolutely sucks but I show up to eat so we always ignore it.  We always say we will try some of the other menu options like the fried shrimp or catfish but the Crab legs call my name every time lol."}
{"text":"Attended an awesome UYE last night and had a blast getting messy with some of Yelp's finest. My family is from New Orleans so I grew up on crawfish and crab boils. My standards are pretty high for crawfish and this place delivered!   They have so many flavors and spice levels to choose from ! We got the 2 lbs of crawfish with the Hot & Juicy Special flavor with no spice. I know that sounds lame, but trust me, the \"no spice\" is still plenty hot. The mild is more like a medium and medium = HOT. Be careful when you order here people! The waitress steered us to the \"no spice\" and I'm very thankful she did. They were perfect.   We also got 1 lb of the snow crab. The snow crab were some of the best I've had in Las Vegas. Absolutely no comparison to the snow crab you get on the buffet lines !   Soo the biggest con about this place is its' hella EXPENSIVE! I honestly could throw down 4-5 lbs of crawfish in one sitting but at $9.99 a freaking lb I couldn't justify spending $50 on dinner when I could get a steak at the nicest steak restaurant in Vegas for that price. I guess I'm spoiled coming from TX and New Orleans where crawfish over $5 a lb is considered highway robbery!! My mom died when I told her I spent $9.99 on crawfish. I know we're in the desert so we have to pay a premium for everything, but geez... I wish I could say I'll be returning frequently, but with my appetite for crawfish I can only afford to eat here every once in awhile!!"}
{"text":"I was in Vegas for a golf getaway and decided to try this place.  A co-worker of mine recommended after going to the restaurant in West Hollywood.  I ordered one pound of shrimp with the hot N juice seasoning.  This is basically a combination of all of the four seasonings that are offered.  The hot N juicy seasoning has a very unique taste that I didn't particularly like.  I did however LOVE the fried shrimp.  The breading that was used was spicy cornmeal.  Man...they sure know how to cook those bad boys.  They were so good, I returned the next day for a second helping!  I will go back again, but try a different seasoning the next time.   And buy-the-way....I really wish they would remove the heads of shrimp before they serve them however."}
{"text":"I ordered the shrimp and over half of them were old and mushy, the heads were broken off.. Yuck. I'll stick with Smoking Crawfish across the street, their sauce is very different from HJC not as greasy with much more flavor!!"}
{"text":"If you hate getting messy eating, this is probably not the place for you.  Half of the budget at this place is probably paper towels.  They do not have much on the menu, but what they do they do very well.  Border line 5 review.  I think the only thing holding it back from a 5 is the nature of crawfish itself.  I don't mind getting messy but it is a lot of work for not a whole lot of sustenance from each crustacean.  If I were to go there again, I would probably get the shrimp.  Less work, more reward.  The food comes out in boiled bags which you rip open.  Good idea to use the bib which is provided.  I went for one less than the spiciest sauce, and they were much spicier than used to when ordering at that level."}
{"text":"Hell yeah. I'm Southern by the grace of God and we know crawfish so do these folks!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times now.  I usually order the crayfish and shrimp(hot and juicy medium).  The medium isn't crazy spicy like boiling crab and the hot.  The crayfish are always good, I've never found gross or bitter one here.  Boiling crab is still my favorite spot, but this place is a close second when I come to Vegas."}
{"text":"Food was good, but not the best crawfish we have had.  Some of us ordered with the Hot N Juicy sauce, which some of my friends thought it was too salty; I didn't mind it too much.  I ordered a pound of crawfish and a pound of clams in the Hot N Juicy sauce extra spicy just for myself.  I didn't think it was spicy at all, and most other places I've been to, when I get it spicy, it actually burns my lips.  And they put my crawfish and clams in separate bags, which was fine.  But the clams were 95% empty shells because most of the clam meat had fallen out and I had to dip my fingers in the sauce to look for them.  It didn't feel like there was enough clam meat hiding in the sauce to match the number of empty shells.  We still enjoyed our dinner and left full."}
{"text":"This is their second location just a block from the over-busy original. Wow! This is a must when in Vegas! The crawfish, shrimp, mussles, and crab were all amazing! All were served bathed in cajun spice on a plastic clad table. FUN and YUMMY!!! Please open one in Scottsdale!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic experience! You must try the craw fish, but also get a good taste of their crab legs and/or the mussels also served in a boil bag dumped on your table with corn and potatoes - order them \"sweet & spicy\" style... attach bib and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Super good, I always get mine to go.. Only thing I'd say they could work on are their prices. Boiling crab has the exact same stuff (taste a little better too) for cheaper.. The staff is super friendly and fast so that's the reason I don't mind going here."}
{"text":"Great tasting sauce! I had the snow crab, clams, shrimp, and king crab. I would come back. Great service. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"If you told me about a Chinatown in Vegas, I would assume there is another theme casino going up where landing 3 fake Prada bags in a slot machine is a jackpot.  Apparently, it's an actual part of Vegas. Well slap me silly, get me an asian massage and love me long time!  Somehow there is also a Cajun style crawfish restaurant in the smack dab middle of it.  One of my favorite things right of the bat is the eat-in style - roll of paper towels, plastic single-use table covers, and bibs. They know yo' ass is gonna make a mess. And because their food is fresh, this is not a pun!  The shrimp and crawfish are a nice hefty size. Not the itty bitty crap you would get at Sizzler. However, if you cone hungry and have your eyes set on crawfish, you have to realize that there is a small ratio of edible meat per square inch. It's only the tail. Shrimp is a better option in this respect.    If you are really hungry, which is completely possible if there is a wait and you stand outside, watching people eat through the window, they have a great fried food menu, including chicken, crab, catfish, shrimp, and fries.  The shrimp, crawfish, and other fish is available in several flavors, ranging from mild to cajun to hot-n-juicy.  It comes out in a nice plastic bag with the sauce.  All get nicely fumed with flavor after they are boiled.  Pair that with a nice cold brew and you will understand the draw of this place.    I hope this wasn't a mirage in the middle of the desert and this place really does exist."}
{"text":"We had a blast here. Seriously bringing dinner in a big plastic bag? It was so much fun. Their sampler was terrific. Don't wear anything that can't be cleaned."}
{"text":"Very good, I recommend the shrimp boil with sausage,corn, and potatoes. It was inexpensive and worth the money. The hot and juicy seasoning was different, zesty yet lemony in a way. It's a lot cheaper than \"the angry crab\" and is a great place to eat if you want seafood by the pound for cheaper. Will definitely come here again"}
{"text":"The food was good, but awful service. We were ignored throughout our meal. We asked for assistance to 3 different waitresses. Finally we got the managers attention and she was the only nice one that stopped to help. It's a smaller location that fills with noise; people's conversations, crying babies, and laughter. I did not feel comfortable there and felt a bit claustrophobic. I recommend for you to go down the road to the 4810 Spring Mountain Rd, Las Vegas, NV 89102 location. Much better service over there!"}
{"text":"Had dinner with my cuz and our wives.  Place was packed and busy as always.  The shrimp, sausage, corn, potatoes, crab legs were pretty awesome.  However, the spicy levels might have been off a little.  If you're not into \"hot\" foods, then this isn't the place for you.  But, if you're willing to eat some good seafood and sweat a little, this is a must... just get the mild level at the most.  (You've been warned)."}
{"text":"This place is the BOMB!! The soft shell crab is a MUST!!! Crawfish were on point"}
{"text":"I decided to give H&J another try since the manager offered me a free pound for my not so good experience the first time. I came with my two good friends who LOVE Hot & Juicy so might as well try it again. This time I REALLY enjoyed it. It wasn't too sweet and this time I was given S&P with lemon and it was SO GOOD. We also ordered rice, cajun fries, sausage, and chicken nuggets. I usually try to stay away from pork but I had to give the sausages a try. They were really good in the H&J sauce. I will definetly be coming back and treat my boyfriend to dinner here so he can give them another try too! Thank you Noemy for the generous free shrimp! :-)"}
{"text":"Having recently been disappointed and Angered by another popular \"cajun\" Crab and crawfish place that seems to think it's cool to swap out cajun spices for mexcan spices, I had a little trepidation about trying H&JC. When I walked in I was actually pretty happy to pass a group of guys with decidedly cajun accents. Happy looking Cajuns in a Cajun restraunts is a really good sign.  I ordered a pound of crawfish...\"sorry it's Sunday and all we have today is frozen\"...I probably should have said thanks anyhow but was Jonesing for some crawfish and had just driven from East Mesa. I also ordered shrimp.   The shrimp was awesome with the seasoning, but I'm just one of those people that finds frozen crawfish to be very inferior to fresh boiled crawfish, the meats tougher on frozen and half the time the heads are just plain bitter and disgusting. I can't even eat etoufe because of those tough desecrated pieces of something that used to be a thing of beauty. It's like asking for poached eggs and getting two that were fried until the yoke starts to turn green.  I will come back...on a day other than Sunday. Other than the toughness of the frozen, the seasoning was excellent and exactly what I'd hoped for and expected from cajun...not some crazy mexican spice that still burn your hands two days later.  Next time I expect to give them 5 stars."}
{"text":"This place is so good. The quality and price are spot on.  The flavors are amazing and the menu is surprisingly extensive.  We had two pounds of crawfish, and it was exactly as I had hoped: juicy, spicy, savory with just the right amount of acid to cut through the generous amount of butter and not leave you feeling too disgusted.  We also tried the cajun fries, which were delicious and a half order of the andoulle sausage, both of which were delicious.  The main attraction, of course, is the crawfish.  It's fun.  It's messy and I like how the restaurant doesn't try to take itself too seriously.  This place is definitely a gem and I would recommend that everyone go at least once to try it out."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  I've been wanting to come here for quite some time.  1 - THEY HAVE GLOVES!  YOU MAY ASK FOR GLOVES AND THEY WILL GIVE THEM TO YOU.  Then you won't smell."}
{"text":"This place was so good! My boyfriend and friend who we were visiting and recommended this place, dropped in after a long road trip from Utah and it was so rewarding! It was us three and we got \"The Drool\" combo which included 1 lb Crawfish, 1 lb Shrimp, dozen Andouille Sausages,  2  Corns and 2 Potatoes,  1/2 lb Snow Crab and Cajun Calamari, we got that in medium juicy cajun and it was perfect. We almost went for the clams but realized we were going to have dessert. I can't wait to come back here because it was the first real time I enjoyed Louisiana style (typically not a fan).   As for the service it was ok. They would just speed past you but somehow magically dropped off the food. It was ok, could improve"}
{"text":"Our 2nd time here and once again, I love the taste of seafood with a kick to it.  This time around though was very poor service, the server only came to our table to take our order, bring the meal and pick up the check.  My drink cup was always empty and if I did not ask, I would have died.   Once again, the food is great but service is very important too.  I will continue to come back but I hope the service improves.  Happy holidays"}
{"text":"I get to Vegas about 5-6 times a year, and the last time we were in the mood for something different (and not in a casino). Our friend found a review for Hot N Juicy online and we decided to try it out.  The food was great (AND HOT), if you go, be prepared to get greasy and have really good spicy cajun/creole food.  The owners were friendly and made sure we had enough to eat and drink. The timing of all the food coming out was a little off, but I think that will improve with them only being open a couple of months when we went.  The only bad thing for visitors is getting back to your hotel if you don't have a rental car. The taxi situation near Chinatown is not good at nights (especially on weekends). If you have your own car... head west on Spring Mountain Road, and be ready for a good ol' fashioned crawfish broil..."}
{"text":"Stopped by here on vacation because of all the hype.  I was VERY disappointed.  Atleast half were dead and I'm being generous.  The flavor/spice was ok...it didn't absorb in the meat like it should.  3 days here and this has been my absolute WORST meal.  If you have crawfish in your area, don't bother with this place."}
{"text":"The wait staff was really nice and attentive. Now the Food....the Snow crab legs we steamed to perfection. The corn fritters were to die for and the fried shrimp golden crispy and flavorful just how I like them. They have several types of sauces and levels of spice. I got the light spice and that had a serious kick. Their special house flavor (thinks it hot n juicy,  you can ask) was amazing. My crab legs were steamed in it but I dipped the shrimp and corn fritters in it too be side that's how yummy it was. I definitely recommends trying out this place."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times but my most recent experience was gooooooooooood. The hostess or manager (couldn't figure it out) who seated us was very personable. Five stars because she engaged with my son. He hardly gets treated like he's there and I loved that she had a little conversation with him when we got to our table. We're not the type to use gloves when peeling our shrimp and dug in with our bare hands...all eyes on us and heads turning but we didn't care because that's Filipino roots for ya! :P"}
{"text":"This was the second time I've been to Hot N Juicy and both times they have not disappointed. Got 2 pounds of crawfish and the corn fritters and both were great. We were greeted immediately and our server was very attentive. Presented me the different teas and, of course, I had to choose the sweet tea. With this being a Tuesday, it was a good time to get in here as its always crowded on the weekends. Overall, the crawfish was on point and so were my wife's shrimp. Make sure to get them boiled in the garlic butter, or other seasonings as it makes it that much better. If you have a chance to make it out during the week, please do it. It's not as crowded and they will take good care of you."}
{"text":"One of the best Hot n Juicy I've been to in Vegas. Always chose the one close to Decatur on Spring Mountain! The Henderson location is the worst!"}
{"text":"Now this Hot N Juicy is pretty much the best in Vegas. I luv the setup and the food I had was amazing! I eat extra spicy food so not much spicy impresses me but I was impressed of how it made my mouth sting a bit! Service was fast and the wait wasn't too long. I went on a Sunday night an hour or two before closing. When I order Hot N Juicy I like to have them go easy on the butter so my flavor can be rich and less runny! The prawns were huge as well as nice size crawfish. The Cajun fries were amazing and the waitress I believe was Ashley, who definitely made sure we were well taken care of. I will definitely being returning!"}
{"text":"Always a great time here! Very great food and service. Tried the raw oysters here they have a homemade spicy cocktail sauce that is wonderful! Also got the corn fritters for the first time and they were great! Draya was a great server very personable and attentive all night! Will be returning very soon!"}
{"text":"Hot N Juicy Crawfish has my top vote.  The shrimps and lobsters are excellent with juicy cajun and spicy sprinkles.   My son and I had one lb of shrimp and 1.8 lb lobster because I didn't know, if he would finish it all.  At the end, it ended up being not enough for two of us.  The staff of ladies are awesome and ensures their customers are are taken care of.  Come on in and give them a try."}
{"text":"Great food!  We ordered half pound of shrimp with spicy cajun sauce and same for the whole lobster.  The food comes out in a plastic bag with a good layer of juice at the bottom.  When you open the bags, they are steaming hot so be careful.  Once you take a bite, you will see how delicious they are.  It's a little pricey, but well worth the cost.  I would recommend this location for sure."}
{"text":"I want to first say this place isn't bad, I just didn't find the experience worth the cost. My wife and I went here on \"Date Night\" and waited for well over an hour and a half for a table only to have our table given away due to poor management. Of course after they realized what they did we only waited another fifteen minutes to be seated. Now the crawfish is good but I don't like getting only 1/2 piece of corn per order that's a little ridiculous at these prices. My wife and I have never been back and probably won't because their are other sources of crawfish in the valley with much better prices who don't misplace your name."}
{"text":"I love this place! My fam owns a crawfish joint back home so this gets the job done when I need my seafood boil fix! Can't go wrong w anything here on the menu."}
{"text":"Love this place!  I used to go to one in Vegas when i lived there and could not wait when i heard this one was opening.  I love the spices and eating with my hands.  I personally have never heard of waitresses giving instructions on how to eat your own food. Lol.  I think when I was 6 I surmised the crawfish look like mini lobsters and you probably eat them the same.  Anyway.  The place is really good and everyone i have brought here has loved it.  I wish they were able to take reservations for large parties."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a great casual dining experience with amazing food this is the place. If you're looking for a romantic dinner this is not the place.   It's noisy but the atmosphere is good. The service was great and the food tasted incredible.  You're going to get messy eating here but it's worth it. Make sure you have a beer to wash it down!"}
{"text":"I am astonished by the people who don't seem have any problem eating with their fingers, at a table covered with what appears to be plastic garbage bags, instead of a table cloth.  They eat with plastic gloves on their fingers, cocktails are served in plastic cups, and there are no silverware, nor plates.  This place may have tasty food, but it irresponsibly generates a ton of plastic trash.  Your cooked seafood is served to you in a plastic bag and you are expected to eat it from that plastic bag!  It was a culture shock; it's not my cup of tea, and I will not return.  Positive note:  the staff is wonderful.    For the same money, I recommend Pappadeaux Seafood Kitchen."}
{"text":"Amazing!  Food tastes great and the staff is nice.  Hot and juicy special sauce with the lobster, king crab legs, shrimp, mussels, and clams is the winner."}
{"text":"I'd be lying if I told you I was excited to try Hot N Juicy. My Vegas friends were going on about it and I'm sort of a Cajun snob when it comes to this type of food. Whenever anyone mentions seafood in a bag in the back of my head I'm rolling my eyes thinking \"Psh, this is gonna taste like shit compared to Boiling/Kickin Crab.\" Okay I was wrong. The seafood was fresh and the flavor of the Hot N Juicy sauce was fiiiire (bomb AND super spicy). I got spicy because I usually get spicy at boiling/kickin and it was a bit much so I recommend getting medium. The fries were definitely not the business.... And the corn was a bit soggy... BUT ONE THING I HIGHLY RECOMMEND and will def come back for: ettouffe. It isn't necessarily gumbo but it's similar to it just less soupy...  omg seriously so fucking delicious. DROOL."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb and the prices are great.  I always get the snow crab, corn & potatoes but my husband raves over the fresh crawfish.  I am a huge fan of the garlic butter seasoning but apparently I get bad garlic breath and so I have since switched to the Hot N Juicy seasoning and it is amazing.  Everything is a little spicy so I always order mild.  The place can get packed at night and doesn't take reservations so try to get there early.  Definitely wear gloves & a bib or be prepared to get messy."}
{"text":"If you enjoy the southern expression of seafood. This is a must taste! We started with Soft-shell Crab and Cajun Fries Basket, Cajun Calamari then we moved on to The Drool covered in the Hot N Juicy Medium Sauce. All I can say is AMAZING! The sauce was so tasty I almost ate my fingers off! We ate during the lunch hour and experienced 5 star service from Selena. She informed us well concerning our menu decisions and recommended wonderful beverages. Can't wait to return for round two!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in Las Vegas. Especially this location never disappoints me. Their sauce is always on point. I always used to get a pound of shrimp with Hot & Juicy special sauce. But when I got introduced to the snow crab legs, I never went back to shrimp. It is perfection in my mouth. I can eat H&J all day errday!!!  Every time I go to H&J i request to be seated in Molly's section. She is so amazing and HOT! She is very attentive, especially with the drinks. It's annoying when your mouth is on fire and your server is nowhere to be found. But this girl is always taking care of her section. Great food, great service!"}
{"text":"Really fun experience with good friends! I've never worn gloves and a bib and had my food brought to me in a bag and shared with the table. It was messy and delicious and we got Cajun spices all over our beer glasses. :)   I have no idea how much it cost because my buddy grabbed the bill, but we got 2 pounds of shrimp, 2 pounds of crab and 2 pounds of mussels to split between three people. It sounds like alot, but it was just enough, actually. Plus it came with a little corn on the cob and a little potato for each of us. We chose the medium level of spice, which was plenty spicy for me!   So this is food you have to WORK for. You have to tear the heads and legs off of the shrimp and peel them and you have to crack open your crab legs and pry the meat out. But it's WORTH it! The mussels required NO work and were delicious. The shrimp was, ya know, shrimp. The crab was delectable - I freakin' love a good juicy piece of crab meat. :)   We felt like three ravenous animals tearing apart food with our hands and leaving a mess of shells and sea creature parts behind. Awesome.   My boyfriend was not a fan of the chicken tenders he ordered; he said they were slightly worse than the kind you buy in the freezer section of the grocery store. And they didn't have BBQ sauce, just ketchup and not-so-good ranch. So yeah. Get the seafood."}
{"text":"The Westgate location is nice.  Not too noisy, service was great, place felt clean.  The food, however, is not quite my style.  I had the lobster, which comes swimming in a pool of garlic butter and spices inside a plastic bag.  I had to wear their (provided) plastic gloves, which became so slippery in the \"butter bath\" that I couldn't hold the nutcracker to open the lobster.  My husband, however, loves their food.  He gets clams and mussels, loves the taste, loves the whole experience.  The messy, slippery, spicy part just isn't for me.  I'm sure we'll go back and I'll try the fried shrimp, one of the few items available without the \"bag and gloves\"."}
{"text":"Hot and Juicy Crawfish was good but not as good as Hang 10 in Alameda, CA.  I had shrimp in the Hot an Juicy medium sauce which is a combination of all of the sauces. It would have been better without the lemon pepper in the sauce. The shrimp were large and cooked perfect. It is weird to have the wait staff in a restaurant this small to all be wearing walkie-talkies and earpieces. The staff was very attentive to the guest. I can't wait to try the new location in Orlando since that is where I live."}
{"text":"My favorite low country boil style seafood place! Service is wonderful, can be slow when it gets busy but it's to be expected.  They really have a bit of an edge over other similar places; gloves, extras (corn,potato, sausage) included when you get 2lbs of crawfish. Be cautious when ordering your spice level, sometimes even the mild can be hotter than you'd expect, but always get the hot n juicy!  Only place that has compared to this place is chasin tails back in VA, but they are missing the rice :P"}
{"text":"This is my favorite seafood restaurant. The price is really affordable and the food is amazing. The costumer service is really good and it didn't take long to get your food."}
{"text":"First time here and I enjoyed it. I will probably be back, but our service was a little lacking... maybe it was just a fluke?  Went on a Wednesday night & Westgate was packed because there was a hockey game and a car show going on. We actually didnt have any wait so that was great. Our server didnt ask if we had been there before, so my friend had to explain everything to me/make recommendations.  I got half a pound of shrimp, Hot N Juicy, spicy & 2 potatoes. At first they tried to give my friend the wrong order, & it wasnt really busy so Im not sure how that was messed up. When we did get our food, we had to ask for plasticware & wait for that. The food itself was great! Lots of flavor, garlicky, & definitely SPICY. Maybe next time Ill try the medium.   The shrimp come shell on, head & tail included, but they give you everything NOT to make a mess (gloves, paper towel, bib) & I definitely appreciated that. Hopefully service is better next time!"}
{"text":"So basically the food was amazing i would give it a 10 star instead of 5. But im writing this and giving a 1 star because i've been bothered alot from the sink in the bathroom. The sink should be either automatic or at least it should have a handle where i can manage to open the water and rinse the oil and the food from my hand without worrying to press on the sink more than 10+ times while washing. It really bothered me because everyone is doing the same im doing and pressing on it while their hands are dirty and filled with oil and i'll have to press it after people and give my hands dirt again and again.  If you could solve this problem and change the sink to a sink that has a handle that would be so much great and everyone will be happy about it."}
{"text":"This is just a fun place to go, but not worth the work. We ordered shrimp and snow crab, both had great flavor. Of course, I wanted some rice to spoon the sauce over. I might take tourists here for something unique, or I may come back if I crave this specific flavor, but otherwise I don't see myself coming here \"just because.\"  I would totally pay more money for gloves that were appropriately sized. I despised those one-size-fits-all cheap plastic gloves that slide all over the place."}
{"text":"Its super cramped inside, but its expected because maximize capacity = more profit. If you're being seated next to a window, take off all top layers (i.e. coats and sweaters, NOT shirts and bras) because it WILL get hot.  We ordered two pounds of shrimp and a pound of crawfish, and I'm pretty sure the shrimp was not fresh. The shell was limpy and most of the heads were detached from the body. The crawfish was okay, as are the chicken wings and the fried shrimp, but the thing to try is the soft-shell crab and the Cajun fries- those two were unforgettable, especially the crab.  The staff here was pretty good, they checked in on us (genuinely checking in, as in how is the food and is there anything they can bring us) a few times and refilled our drinks often since fluids depleted rapidly to offset the spiciness of the the...spices.  With that being said this concept is ripped entirely from California's Boiling Crab, right down to the tables and chairs. BC is heaps better, with much more strategic interior organization and decorations, fresher seafood, and a more efficient staff. But hey, this is Vegas, so whatever opens in Vegas, stays in Vegas...right?"}
{"text":"Really love the food at this place. I try and hit this spot once or twice a month.   Here's a few things people need to understand:  1. Food can sometimes be slow(never has it came out wrong)  2. Food comes out at weird times, since different things take shorter or longer to cook rarely does it all come out at the same time. So for people who complain about this go to Angry Crab or their other locations. It's part of the deal.   3. The reason for the 4 stars. Service is a crap shoot and it's not like I demand a lot. Usually when I go, I ask for Maddie and things are awesome. Most of the rest of the staff is forgettable. I truly miss some of their staff from when they first opened. But thankfully Maddie is there and know how to rock things!!!!"}
{"text":"Customer service was top notch they made us feel like family. The food was amazing i got 1 pound of black mussels in a garlic butter sauce out of this world and just the right spice. I also got half pound of shrimp in the hot and juicy sauce. Well worth the mess on my hands. Hands down the best seafood i have had in a long time."}
{"text":"Wild style seafood, sauce became very thin. Less celery taste but pretty great for late night meal after bar!"}
{"text":"I always went to hot & juicy on spring mountain where it was always packed.  Since i moved to Henderson, i now come to this location very often and i love coming before dinner time. Hardly anyone there.  The service is great, friendly servers! Food always comes in perfect timing and never get disappointed. I always get a pound of the snow crab legs juicy Cajun & extra spicy with half a pound of shrimp and the soft shell crab basket with Cajun fries. It's soooooo good!  I'm a repeat customer & i love it here.  If you've never been to hot & juicy before, prepare to smell like seafood for the rest of the day lol. It's so damn good i don't even care! Haha."}
{"text":"Have been here several times since they open their doors in February. Its always a fun time!!! Servers are friendly, management seems to be always trying to go the extra mile. I really love their food but the atmosphere is what has me coming back!!!"}
{"text":"I come here at least once a week & they never let me down! The servers are always so friendly & attentive! The only thing I dislike is that the prices change every so often because it's based on market price! So you never really know how much you spend lol   My usual is always a pond of shrimp, GARLIC BUTTER mild-medium. Some cooks make it spicier than others! And if I'm super hungry, I'll get crawfish as well in a separate bag just for the extra sauce!  w/ Cajun fries or calamari!!!!! Definitely worth the try if you're a calamari lover like me! I do also sometimes get potatoes or corn on the side because you can never have enough extra sauce!!!!   So if you're looking to try seafood, but a different kind of seafood... this is the place!"}
{"text":"I am extremely disappointed in this location. It was my first time coming to this location, keep in mind I go to Hot N Juicy once a week but at the three other locations. It really just depends what location I am closest to. We just so happened to be at PH at the time I was craving shrimp!   Let's get back to the point! The lady upfront, her name is Ashley (Team Lead) was the rudest person I've ever encountered at any Hot N Juicy! First off, I understand you are busy and I understand it is very stressful! BUT DO NOT TELL ME OUR TABLE IS READY and have my family & I sit there for another 20-30 mins after already waiting almost an hour! And DO NOT tell me our table is ready when there is no one even cleaning our table. I had to tell 3 different servers why no one was cleaning the table we eventually got seated at! I eventually asked her why no one was cleaning our table & she responded \"well can't you see we are busy? We are short staff and our kitchen is backed up. I will get to your table in 10 minutes\" WHY WHY WHY tell me our table is ready????!!!!! If you were going to throw in my face that you're short staffed. Finally got a manager and asked her to clean the table because the lady up front told us our table was ready..   I am not one to doubt that they were all probably stressed because of the excessive amount of people there, but that does not give you a right to one give an attitude to your customers. I understand that we were a big party, but we were there before half the people she decided to seat before us! First come first serve right?! We waited over an hour and watched multiple people get seated before us! I am not impressed. I hope one day my opinion will change about this location. Sadly because I am someone's who loves this restaurant and their food! ?"}
{"text":"Overall, would I come back. Yes. The prices are comparable to other places like this. What stands out is the flavor of the sauce; not the strongest. What I look for when I eat at establishments like this is the flavoring they use. I like a strong full flavor, here, it doesn't give me that full flavor I'm looking for. I would still recommend trying it out for yourself but I've had better flavor at other establishments. The service was top notch, quick to accommodate and quick to refill. Nice environment and you don't feel rushed, you can sit and chat with friends without feeling like they are trying to rush you out the door."}
{"text":"Food and service was awesome we will be eating here every time we visit. I ordered a red potato w some type of spice and 10 shrimp which was ver flavor full.."}
{"text":"Pretty happy i got to try this place. We went mid afternoon, so there wasnt much of a wait for seating or food.  We got crawfish,  but they ran out? Of fresh ones,  so we got frozen,  and got half pound of shrimp.  The seafood was a big size,  had to order 2lb of crawfish to get corn & potato. We got the hot n spicy special with medium hotness. It was really spicy! If you're use to spice maybe itll be fine, but next time ill get mild,  which im sure will be my medium. The sauce was definitely worth it,  flavored the shrimp so well. The same sauce was use for crawfish, was still good,  but since it was frozen,  the sauce didnt seep through the crawfish for flavor,  it was a little bland/taste of water after u defrost any seafood. But it was still good.  I can only imagine what the fresh ones will be like! And the frozen crawfish were also cheaper.  Service was fast and food was good. Definitely glad we went oit of our ways for it."}
{"text":"This place was pretty awesome. Service is great. Our server was Ashley and she was very attentive! Now, nothing against this place, but my family and I were comparing to The Boiling Crab the entire time, And really nothing can compare to the boiling crab!!! But Hot & Juicy can stand on their own for sure! We ordered clams, shrimp, and crawfish and everything was amazing. We added corn and potatoes and sausage and mmmm!!!! I'm craving to go back! Hits the spot when I don't want to drive 6 hours to LA!"}
{"text":"Had to try it since we were in Vegas... People told me it was better than Boiling crab... i ain't a fan of craw fish/shrimps but i mean... boiling crab's seasoning is pretty good! So we went in... looks very similar to bc... but when we got the food..... yea... def not like our bc... don't think i would ever go back..."}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of Hot N Juicy even though I'm allergic to shellfish (nothing Benadryl can't fix).  It's laid-back, service is great and the food is simple but fantastic.  It's always busy...packed with locals and tourists.  We go here a lot especially around lent.  If this location gets to crazy-busy, there's another one a few blocks away.  They have oysters, mussels, crab legs, lobster, blue crab, clams, shrimps, and of course, crawfish.  With the exception of the lobster, you order shellfish by the pound.  You can pick the seasoning you want: cajun, Louisiana style, garlic butter, lemon pepper and hot n juicy.  Pick your spice level: less than mild, mild, medium, spicy extra spicy.  Pick your sides and appetizers.  You get a bib and you could ask for a pair of gloves because it'll get messy...you don't want to ruin your manicure, do you?  I do away with gloves since I like to lick the juices off my fingers when I eat here.   I'm not a big fan of crawfish because you it's too much work and you get a teeny tiny bit of crawfish meat.  I always get less than mild garlic butter...either crab legs or lobster.  Hey, if I'm going to have an anaphylactic reaction, I might as well make it count.    Don't take your date here unless you've been together forever.  Or maybe you can test-drive your date to see if he/she's down to get dirty.  The garlic smell lingers...on your breath and hands no matter how many times you brush your teeth, gargle and wash your hands.  After a day, you should be good to go."}
{"text":"The last time I went before last night,  they had ESPN on. Can't miss my OKC game! Sweet!!!  I've always been satisfied every time I come here.  I like the food and definitely the service.  So last night, my BFF and I had a talk over crab legs, sausage and shrimps which were delicious.  Our server was extremely patient since it took us a while to decide what we want to eat.  A pile of dirty plastic gloves and bibs later, my friend and I were still chatting away but we didn't feel like we were being rushed to get out already when our server said, \"lemme clean the table so you can continue talking without getting anything dirty\".   They're taking pictures of diners now to post on Instagram.  Then the BFF decided to embarass me to death by having a male server come to our table and ask him odd questions!  He was very nice though and wasn't ticked off or anything like that.  That is one true test of the great service here!"}
{"text":"I am a Louisiana girl, I almost crashed my car when I saw a place called HOT N JUICY CRAWFISH! I had to go and I am glad I did.  When I arrived, there was no wait, my girlfriend and I were promptly seated. We ordered 2lbs of crawfish and a pound of shrimp, we added corn and potatoes to our mix (which are 50 cents a piece to add on). They have several different flavor profiles. We went with the Hot N Juicy Seasoning. It was heaven. It was spicy, savory, and garlicy.  In Louisiana when we have Crawdad boils, we throw down newspaper, here the tables were covered in plastic and they gave us bibs (which I need whenever I eat).   They will show you how to eat mudbugs if you have never had them, but I am a pro. They serve up large drinks in Styrofoam (which is so 1995), but they keep them filled.The seating isn't the most comfortable and the smell of place is in the air from like a mile away. After eating here, be sure to shower. You will smell like the fruit of the sea and garlic for like 2 days. It is totally worth it!  I don't know if their prices are fixed, but 1 lb of Crawfish was $9.99, not bad at all."}
{"text":"Shelby was sooooo amazing!!! One of the best servers I've ever had!!! She's beautiful, knowledgeable about the menu and very easy to talk to. I'm DEF coming back to ask for her."}
{"text":"Went to Vegas over the New Years and lemme tell you, this meal made my entire trip. We had some issues with the hotel, the plane, and pretty much everything in between but this meal here made the entire trip for us. It was SOOOOOO good. We had mussels, oysters, king crab legs, snow crab legs, lobster, and of course crawfish. Mouth is watering just thinking bout it. We got both the Cajun seasoning and hot n juicy seasoning in various different heat levels. For me the medium was perfect. My boyfriend got extra spicy but he said it really wasn't all that hot. Then again he eats spice like it's nothing. Overall the meal and the service was awesome. We only waited bout 20min till we were sat and we had a relatively large party(7people). Definitely plan on going back my next trip !"}
{"text":"this is definitely a pull your hair back and dig in kind of place.  everything is served in bags and I normally order the shrimp hot n juicy medium.  i love spicy food, but medium is just right for me.  love the corn soaked in the sauce and the andouile sausage.  Cajun fries are spicy hot and crisp... service is normally good, but always expect a wait to get in.. even having 2 locations it's always packed"}
{"text":"My cousin and her bf took me and my bf here when we were visiting Vegas. They actually ate @ hot n juicy the day before and it was sooo good that they wanted to take us and eat there again. They kept raving about how great it was and boy were they rite. We went during the day for lunch so there wasn't really anyone there which was good bc the place gets packed for dinner. I'm from the bay so I'm not new to the crawfish scene. I've tried several crawfish places in the past but hot n juicy is by far the best. If you've ever been to a crawfish restaurant then you know it's all about the sauce they cook it in. The hot n juicy special is the bomb diggity. The perfect combo of herbs and spices. You also get to pick the level of spicyness that you want. I personally prefer the shrimp over the crawfish but thats just me. Peeling shrimp is less work and more meat so you do the math. I wish there was a hot n juicy in the bay. Maybe they will think about expanding soon. lol Be prepared to get your hands dirty but it is super worth it. You will not be disappointed! There was also an episode of man vs. Food about hot n juicy too so you know it must be good."}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing service! I ate here a few days ago. Our server Trent was very attentive and caring. He was very energetic and made me feel very comfortable while getting messy in public. I ordered a pound of crawfish and a pound of shrimp hot and juicy, spicy. It was delicious!!! I compared it to Angry Crab also but I think Hot N Juicy is way better! I'll be sure to come back for this awesome food and service!"}
{"text":"Great, hole-in-the-wall type of seafood place! Have gone here a couple of times with my sea-food loving friends and their families, and everyone left very satisfied!  The service was charming, and helpful, as the menu is a bit confusing as far as prices and options. The food was delicious! Probably one of the best raw oysters I've ever had! The spices used were out of this world! Just make sure to ask for mild if you can't handle spicy food.  The location was authentic, right on the edge of Las Vegas China town. Servers spoke English and were informative.   I really enjoyed my dining experience here and will be back when I have a craving for seafood."}
{"text":"I came here once early last year with two of my friends and forgot to review.  This place was pretty busy, we had to wait for like 35min although we arrived at around 6pm. The service was alright, they didn't fill up our water unless we asked for a few times.  The food tasted okay, not as good as the ones I've tried in the bay area. I would try other Cajun style restaurant in LV area the next time when I visit to compare.  We asked them to call a cab for us when we left, they seemed annoyed by calling one for us; we waited for another 20min for the cab to arrive."}
{"text":"Max is an amazing server. Very attentive and always checks up on us. Food was really good but the service was top notch. Definitely going back here to eat in the future."}
{"text":"Hubby and I were looking for some good fried seafood and this place didn't disappoint! We ordered the fried seafood basket and an order of fried shrimp, DELISH!!!! WISH they had one of these back home in GA."}
{"text":"Super good food! My friends and I ordered 2 lbs of shrimp, 2 lbs of crab legs, 2 Cajun fries, sweet potato fries, calamari, and fried catfish!  We ate it allllll up.  My only concern was that the crabs were a bit difficult to crack but then again I'm used to cracking the Alaskan crab legs.  But other than the difficult cracking, the mix of all the seasonings was just a great fusion of flavors to really individualize their seafood from anything I've ever tried.  And it was not primetime when we went so service was pretty fast! Hope they're on top of their game when it is busy!"}
{"text":"I love this location. The building is always neat and clean.  Service 5 stars: Our primary server lazar was a rockstar. He greeted and seated us immediately when we walked in. Of course when someone asks me \"have you eaten here before?\" my answer is \"no, this is my first time.\"   He gave a complete, simple and friendly explanation of how to order, engaged with our group asking what we liked, our level of spice tolerance and his recommendations. We actually added some additional items, we would not normally order off of his recommendation.  Lazar continually maintained our drinks while we were waiting on our food. We were thirsty and we never had a chance to ask for refills he was there.  Food was delivered timely and in the correct sequence.  From that point they maintained an excellent wait time check on our needs and kept our beverages full.   I stopped and asked one of the female wait staff what the name of our server was? She replied honestly \"we are are all your servers here sir, is there anything I can assist you with.\"   First thought: Damn the wait staff here got game.   Food:  4stars Ordered  2 lb crab ordered different flavors and spice levels.  1.5. Shrimp, diff flavor and spice levels. Full oysters on a half shell. Oysters were clean tasting but were disappointingly small. Corn tots, didn't care for them but other members of my party raved about it.  The service put this visit over the top at 5 stars. I will come back here again. Sorry BC."}
{"text":"Service was great! We called it in & picked up our to go order hoping for the best and that's what we got! All cravings satisfied. We got 2lb bag for 2ppl and that was PLENTY. They told us the crawfish were frozen as fresh is out of season. We appreciated the honesty.. They were really awesome from frozen anyway... so YAY! I would recommend this place for eating in too since the atmosphere was great and the staff really friendly. Smelled REALLY good in there too. (Medium heat is pretty hot BTW)."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!!!!! Exactly what I was craving for my Birthday  and they had my wine!!!!!!! Definitely coming back. We ordered king crab legs with must have hot and juicy sauce and shrimp. We were in seafood heaven. Service was top notch too!!!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic spicy shrimp.another go to spot when in las vegas.always busy but the wait is never too long."}
{"text":"Like many others, i decided to try this place after watching the food network.  The fried catfish i ordered was really good.  Definitely would recommend that.  However, the shrimp and crawfish were just average.  The sauce wasn't that good and super duper spicy even though i ordered the mild.  The service staff there was great but i'm sure others reading this post will agree that they really really try and get you to drink a lot of alcohol.  Every time someone passed us by they kept trying to get us to buy more beer.  I understand they're  just doing their job so i'm not gonna hate on them for that.  The service overall was great.  Very attentive and our server even showed us how to properly de-shell and eat crawfish.  My group had an interesting situation while waiting.  The place was full and their was a sign that read \"please wait to be seated\".  So we stood in line at the door and waited.  There was a host that was taking down names for the waiting list so i tried to get his attention to put my name down but he was very busy cleaning the tables and told me to wait.  So i patiently waited only to see people come in behind me and walk up to him and he wrote their names down.  I figured he was smart and courteous enough to realize that i've been standing their waiting especially since we were blocking the aisle and he had to constantly excuse himself from walking past us.  Of course he sits other's before me and i have to go up to him and ask him about my table.  Expectantly, he tells me i'm next and to just be patient.  I honestly feel that this was an isolated situation on my party and shouldn't reflect their overall great customer service but i thought i should share my experience.  If you read any of my other posts you can tell i'm usually pretty quick and short....hopefully you can tell by the length of my comment that this situation annoyed me"}
{"text":"My cousin saw this place on the Food channel and added it to her list. We went late on a Monday night (they are only open until 10pm.) We ordered 2lbs of crawfish & 2lbs of shrimp, Hot & Juicy seasoning, medium. They were boiled in a bag and brought to the table in the bag. We also ordered Cajun fries that were hotter than expected. Fun place with great food."}
{"text":"This location is a bit difficult haha but it's in the same plaza as Bambu.  It's usually crowded to be prepared to wait but wait usually isn't that long.  Bun opt for crab legs while I got the shrimp, I believe my shrimp was about uh... $12 or $14 per lb. We also got their cajun fries and oo they were yum. but over time, it did get salty but if I remember correctly, these fries had more of a cajun taste while boiling crab (my next review!) was more of a kick spicy taste, however Bun says the exact opposite and he's more sensitive to spicy.  Soda beverages were $1.25 with free refills. Sad that they got my flavor wrong but were willing to change it kindly. Tbh I couldn't taste to much of a difference in terms of taste between this and Boiling Crab haha  Total bill was about $40 with tip.   Will be back!"}
{"text":"What's better than good? Great? No! The answer is, \"Finger licking good!\" And let me tell you, Hot n Juicy is the definition of finger licking good cause I will always be licking my fingers afterwards!   This place is delicious. I moved out of Las Vegas for a period of time and whenever I visited this city, I always always always have to eat at Hot n Juicy at least ONCE. It is always a must! The flavors are unique and different. No, I didn't come here due to \"Man vs. Food\" .. in fact, I never watched that show. I came here because I heard it was good and their first location was ALWAYS packed! The wait is always humongous!   And yes, there are actually two locations and this one is their second location on Spring Mountain. It's newer so the decor is more modern and the ventilation should be a whole lot better than their first building.   So you don't like crawfish? That's fine. I don't really have a preference for them either. In fact, I think they're not really worth it. Each crawfish doesn't have much meat ... you'll be eating a few tons before you get full! Why? Well, Hot n Juicy sells it by the pound ... so with the little amount of actual edible goodness you get that comes in the huge clanky shells, you don't get much. But no worries! There is SHRIMP on the menu!! Of course, there's crab and whatnot on the menu too but that's not my concern. SHRIMP is my recommendation and it will fill you up for sure!!  So what they do is sell seafood by the pound. You get to choose a sauce and the spicyness level between mild and extra spicy. The shrimp is cooked in the sauce and they bring it to you in a plastic bags. Yes, it's different. Yes, you may not like being served food still in the bag. Sure, you may not like using your hands and they got plastic gloves for you folks. But it is YUMMYLICIOUS. Prepare to get messy ;) It's honestly worth a try ... get adventurous once in a while. You never know what you'll come across!  I typically order 1 lb of shrimp. Hot n Juicy special. Add corn to that. As for the spicyness level, it depends on my mood. I have tried mild, medium, and spicy. Mild is the best and their mild is not the traditional mild. It's actually spicier than what people would consider mild. It is delicious with a little kick to it that gives it an oomph. Medium, to me, was very similar to the mild ... no real big difference. Now, spicy, that's the REAL kicker! It was SO GOOD. SO SPICY. SO FLAMING HOT. But honestly, go for the mild.   I usually also order the cajun fries. They used to make them as regular fries with cajun powder on top but now they've incorporated the two? Who knows how they go about it but it's pretty good.   So their sauces have a lot of garlic in them. You'll be eating and smelling garlic all night. Be sure you're a garlic lover! You'll even take the smell home so be careful of what you wear and what you bring in! Make sure they're all easily washable :D   And a tip...if you're using your hands to eat, make sure to ask the waitress for some limes/lemons. After you finish eating, wipe your hands with the paper towels to get rid of ALL sauces on your hands. Then you wash and rub your hands with the lime/lemon. Do it thoroughly. It should take off a good deal of the smell away from your hands. Then you just wipe your hands again to get rid of the lemony goodness and wash your hands the regular way! :D  And now I'm craving some Hot n Juicy after writing this review!"}
{"text":"The worst place ever the service is horrible and on top of that we ask for mile but I think they gave us the wrong order because we couldn't even eat it and they take for ever to bring ur food and no body even bothers to come ofter that !"}
{"text":"Food was on Point! Customer service was great too. Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"READ FIRST: DO NOT get the crawfish! I know It's a bit ironic, but they are TINY and can barely get anything out of them.  Now onto the review. I visited the original place in LV a while back and thought the place was decent. Well, this location gives the whole concept a nice face lift with a spacious and casual dining room and a cool-looking bar you can seat at if you are by yourself. Being a saucy peel-and-eat seafood place, please expect a messy experience...and table, and hands, bib, etc. This is a unique eating experience to be shared with friends over a few beers, as long as everyone at the table is willing to work a bit for their food (peeling can be tedious).  I ordered the lemon pepper shrimp with no oil (I was actually impressed the cooks prepared my order fat-free) and my girl ordered the butter garlic crawfish. The seasoning was very good but a bit spicy, specially if you are not into spicy foods at all. My pound of shrimp was very flavorful and each shrimp was plump and perfectly cooked. On the other hand, the pound of crawfish was awful- tiny crawfish with little or no meat in them...A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. I cannot say this enough...JUST GET THE SHRIMP!  Important tips: * Be ready for a messy experience. If you do not like eating with your hands and perhaps getting splashed with shrimp sauce, this place is not for you.  * Get the shrimp and not the crawfish. Also, get two pounds of it if you are hungry.  * They charge 60 cents for a tiny potato! You are better off getting some rice on the side.  * Expect to spend about $15 per person.  * Even no spicy IS a bit spicy."}
{"text":"When they say Hot n Juicy they mean Over-seasoned and Slimy! I ate here almost 2 weeks ago and I still feel like I could breathe salt-water. Add that on top of half my party's food being under-cooked it was a horrible experience. Wasn't even that busy they must just have been new hires. The wait staff was very pleasant and attentive though, the one saving grace. Everyone tells me I just had an off night to give it another shot and maybe I will in a few months when I forget how bad everything was."}
{"text":"Used to love this place. But the service is awful. The last 3times we dine here we were told the blue crab is unavailable. The 4th time we tried, we called ahead to make sure that they do have it. We were only about a block away when we called. We were told that the blue crab is available and that the person on the phone said that she is very sure that they do have blue crab. When we got to the place and finally sat down to order we were told that it hasn't been available. This really freaking piss me off. The parking is a hassle and we don't appreciate being lied to. We called ahead for a reason."}
{"text":"I am definitely a fan as far as fresh seafood goes in town.  We came here for a friend's birthday lunch.  I thought it was odd that there was no sign for the business but the reviews were good so we figured what the heck.  Initially I was skeptical because we were slowly filtering in for a large party and the server bypassed me a few times before I finally was able to get some water and a beer.  After that though it was a good experience.  The server was pretty attentive the rest of the time.  Word to the wise - be prepared to get a little messy.  This is fresh style seafood so they sell it by the pound and toss it in seasoning so you have to pick the crab or crawfish or shrimp depending on what you get in order to eat it.  If shrimp heads gross you out, this may not be for you.  My girlfriend got the crawfish Louisiana style with medium spice which was pretty good but if you haven't had crawfish before be prepared for more work to get to the meat.  It was still pretty good though.  I had the shrimp cajun style with medium spice and it was outstanding.  You still have to pull the heads off and peel the shrimp but the  shrimp were a good size and the price was good too for the amount that you get.  We ended up getting another order cajun style with mild spice.  The birthday boy had crab legs and enjoyed those as well.  Granted, I have had fresh seafood in New Orleans and in D.C. but this is pretty good for being in Arizona.  I would have no problem going back here when in the mood for fresh seafood.  Just make sure you aren't wearing white when you go :)  Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Easy parking, comfortable booth, very good service and clean.  I meant to review that place a long time ago...  Here, everything is about the spices and that flavorful sauce, you cannot  go wrong with any of the seafood items.  I specially like the clams cause there is no pealing to do and you can use the shell to scoop all the juices...so yummy!!!  My favorite side items would be corn, rice and bread roll (French people and their carbs lol!!!)  I also appreciate the Fact that they use real tasty butter and not the hydrogenated crap...  The Cajun fries were not all that but I guess that's because my grandma spoiled me with those fried goodness back in the days!  Perfect place for a Bday party.  By the way the \"medium\" spicy is actually spicy compared to some \"crab shack\" and other restaurant chain but here this is the real deal!"}
{"text":"**Disappointed**        - Boiling Crab - Ever since boiling crab opened last November, Hot & Juicy has done the opposite of stepping up their game (http://www.yelp.com/biz/boiling-crab-las-vegas).        - Watered Down - They have been consistently watering down their \"Hot & Juicy Special\" sauce. They put so little per bag now, I can't even dip my shrimp back in.        - Prices - Their \"Market Prices\" are still a dollar or two above Boiling Crabs.        - Crawfish - Their crawfish are smaller and less fresh than Boiling Crab's crawfish.        - Conversion - Eventually, all of their patrons will wise up to the other \"crawfish/shrimp in a bag\" place in town and it'll be too late for them to turn it around. I used to favor Hot & Juicy over Boiling Crab, but not anymore. **Recommendations**        - I want to give this place a 3.5, so I'll round it up to 4. It's still good, but just a shell compared to it's former self. Unless Boiling Crab has too long of a wait, I'll probably not be coming to Hot & Juicy anymore."}
{"text":"Love this place. Always come here whenever we visit Vegas.  The service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Came to Las Vegas with my hair and makeup team they wanted and were craving this place so we came everybody love their food I would say it was a little messy but delicious"}
{"text":"Poor service!! Food was good but terrible terrible service! 3 hr experience not the good kind!"}
{"text":"The sauce is just amazing but you'll definitely pay for it later.  It's definitely worth the bubble guts and burps. The crawfish wasn't frozen and the crab legs had plenty of meat.  I would definitely skip on the etouffee but overall great meal. They serve beer to wash it all down as well."}
{"text":"Not a fluke, the second time proved to be just as good as the first. I am not proud that Katrina M. and I came here two days within a three day span, but it was that good.  This time we came with her family and ordered 4 pounds of shrimp in spicy Hot N Juicy special, one pound in medium garlic butter, one pound in extra spicy Hot N Juicy special, one pound of spicy Hot and Juicy special crawfish, and one pound of spicy Louisiana Style crawfish. Out of all the seasonings, their namesake is the best at the second to hottest level. Their \"extra spicy\" did not deliver the scorching hot flavor I was expecting and would not make for a decent food challenge. The other two flavors were just mediocre, nothing special. We had also ordered calamari, but they are extremely salty. The sweet potato and Cajun fries are cooked to a superb crispiness. Ask for corn and potatoes to be cooked with your seafood.  Yet again I could not resist the temptation and ordered a Blue Moon to go along with the meal. I might be completely out of the loop, but it has been a while since I have seen a restaurant offer beers for less than $5.50 a bottle. Heineken, Heineken Light, Corona, Corona Light, Sapporo, and Blue Moon are the beers they offer for $3.  I cannot stress enough that you should get there before 6 because the wait is nonexistent. For a party of six, half of us being present, they sat us right away. Yet if another large party came and our group was not all there we would have to give up our table. They cannot be faulted for that. I understand the need to meet the demands. Once we were all sat and ordered, the staff were very attentive with refilling drinks and taking our additional orders."}
{"text":"The flavor is still ridiculously good, the atmosphere is better with the high ceiling and well lit space, but the crawfish are not worth the money. The ones during this visit hardly had any meat. The real deal are the shrimp. These big, plump, and juicy crustaceans steal the show.  At Hot N Juicy, start by picking a protein, followed by seasoning, then the spice factor and finish it off with extras that they will cook in all the juices. For four, we easily dined on one pound of Hot N Juicy Special Spicy Crawfish with two pieces of corn and potatoes, two pounds of HNJ Special Extra Spicy Shrimp with two pieces of corn, two potatoes and half a dozen pieces of sausage, and a basket of ten fried shrimp ($10.99). Most of the seafood are sold at market price, but they tend to stay between $10-$12. Corn are .75, potatoes are .60, and the half portion of sausage was $2.75. The fried shrimp were not a favorite. The cornmeal batter is great for crispiness, but I could barely spot any shrimp. It end up feeling like I was eating friend bread. Beers are cheap for a restaurant. $2.75 for Bud, Bud Light, and Miller Light. $3 for Heineken, Heineken Light, Corona, Corona Light, Sapporo, and Blue Moon. For a quarter more, I am down with getting the import beers.   The service was decent tonight. Our server was quick to refill our water cups. Even one that wasn't ours refilled our cups. Our server did look disappointed that our order was so small, but it was more than enough for us. At a little over $60, the bill is not a cheap meal. I am still more fond of the original location, but this one is rather attractive."}
{"text":"We ordered a half pound of shrimp the whole shabang hot for $8.99 and one pound of green mussels for $10.99 same flavoring, rice and Cajun fries.   We were surprised to see that one pound of shrimp was $13.99, I've never seen it that high before.  The food was what I expected. Had lots of flavor and spice. I've been to multiple locations in CA, NV and AZ.  I've noticed that the service is never really great at hardly any of the locations.   Our servers name was Amanda. Our fries, shrimp and crab came out and we asked if our rice was coming out and she kept saying she would check on it. We would see her coming in and out (we sat outside) and still nothing.  One of the other servers noticed that we wanted to ask for something and she was actually the one who brought it out to us.  Amanda came to check on us a few times, but hardly.  We then asked for more lime and she pretty much forgot and brought it to us when our food was gone.   I enjoy the food at Hot N Juicy, but it's hard to actually get good service here."}
{"text":"We went here a month or so after they had their grand opening. The wait was really long probably about one hour.  Our food took forever to come out, I would guess about 40 mins.  Then when we got our food the rice took another 30 minutes to come out. I was pretty much done with my food already.  The service was horrible and the food wasn't even that great. Which is odd because the Hot N Juicy in Las Vegas and Orange County are two of my favorites.  We only been here once, and never went back."}
{"text":"Horrible.   Went here based on a referral from someon who said \"if you like angry crab you should try hot and juicy\".   Couldn't be further from the truth!!  Nothing about this place is better than Angry Crab. Not the shrimp, the sausages were tiny and not very tasty. The Softshell crab and the calimary were the saltiest things we have every tasted. We couldn't even finish them. The sauces are not hot even when we asked for spicy.  The drink orders got messed up at least 5x during the meal. The server girl had no clue or interest in what she was doing.  If you want good food of this type stick with Angry Crab. This place is all over the place."}
{"text":"The food at this place is delicious! We came in to this Las Vegas location, it was pretty busy so they told us it would be about 30min. In reality it was about 15min. The server was ok, not as friendly as we like our service to be. But the food was fantastic. I got the lobster with potatoes and corn on the \"hot and Juicy\" seasoning it was super fresh and savory! Kind of spicy!   Overall the place is very simple but clean and well kept loved the food!"}
{"text":"10/10 I would definitely come back! I got the medium spice level today and it was awesome! I got a pound of shrimp and they were pretty big!"}
{"text":"Las Vegas is Sin City for a reason; it celebrates the seven deadly sins. In Vegas, your greatest weakness or vice becomes the source of all your pleasures. We were ready to give into our carnal desires and get down and dirty, indulging our voracious, gluttonous appetites. We wanted to get stuffed with something Hot N Juicy.   Hot N Juicy is known for their seafood: crab (Dungeness, blue, snow), shrimp, and of course, crawfish. You pick the type of seasoning (Juicy Cajun, garlic butter, lemon pepper or the Hot n Juicy Special) and the level of spiciness (mild, medium, spicy or extra spicy).   We ordered 2 lbs of snow crab legs and 2 lbs of crawfish with Juicy Cajun at medium, 2 pieces of corn, 2 red potatoes, etouffee (a Cajun seafood stew, similar to gumbo), and a side of sweet potato fries. Eating at Hot N Juicy is not an elegant refine affair. It's messy work because they dump a plastic bag of whatever seafood you ordered and you're only protection is the plastic table covering and a plastic bib. You open the bag and dig in.  The crab meat was very sweet and juicy. It was perfectly cooked. I found that the spiciness of the food depended on the type of seafood because the seasoning is on the outside of the shell. The meat isn't spicy unless you soak it in the sauce first. I found the level of spiciness in the crawfish much higher because the tail meat was much smaller and there was more shell around it, unlike the crab meat where I could pull out large pieces of meat out of the shell. Also I got more spicy sauce from the crawfish because I sucked crawfish heads. After a while my lips got tingly and numb from the Cajun spices.   I've never had crawfish whole before. I only had them de-shelled. While I love crawfish and the meat was great, I'll never have them whole like that again. The tail meat is rather tiny (I like 'em big -- size matters when it comes to these things). At the end, we looked at the mountain of shell and agreed that it was more work than it was worth. Crawfish is mostly shell and I'd rather pay someone to shell them for me.  Etouffee was a spicy rice seafood stew. I liked the flavor and the level of spice was just perfect for me. I thought the rice was a tad overcooked and mushy from just sitting in a pot all day, but in general it was enjoyable.  The boiled red potatoes were much needed as a break from the relentless Cajun spice. They were nice and sweet. The corn is out of season, so not as sweet and juicy as in the summer, but still tasty. The sweet potato fries were crispy and tasty.  The final price for all of us was $30/person for three people. We gorged ourselves on great seafood and left utterly satiated. Happy ending for us indeed.  What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas. But this is one of the few times where you wish you could get crabs and bring them home with you."}
{"text":"You have to know what you are getting when you come here.  I had the shrimp and crab legs.  Food was as expected and sauce was on par as to how the staff described it.  I've been to the boiling crab and I would say this is better since its got more variety and this is more raw in your face good."}
{"text":"I was in Vegas with some buddies this past weekend and made it out to Hot N Juicy.  I got a pound of snow crab, pound of shrimp, corn, and potatoes in the hot n juicy medium sauce.  Everything is fairly priced and cooked to perfection.  The sauce is super tasty.  I don't think you can ask for much more.  Ditch the strip and get out to this gem."}
{"text":"We had the crayfish, the shrimp, the clams, the corn and also had the chicken nuggets.  We had a really good time the food was excellent and will go back!"}
{"text":"What a shame, I certainly liked the food here but the service on my last visit was less than acceptable. I was alone so I was told to have a seat at the bar, that's okay I've down that before. I sat at the bar for about five minutes without being acknowledged by anyone, another customer pulled up a seat at the bar a few mines later and she was immediately assisted by server Aimee. I'm not one to cause a scene, but I had to flag down a server and let her know I wasn't served as yet. Food finally arrived with no offer of gloves, but Taylor made it right by quickly getting me a setup. It was a poor start, but thanks to Taylor, I might stop in and give this place another try."}
{"text":"Do not come here is all I can say.  I ordered on the phone and gave them 30 mins of wait and they still did not even have my order  No apologies and they give attitudes instead.   Save urself from the aggregation and go to other locations"}
{"text":"Coming from New York and having \"The Boil,\" this place was a complete let down. First, there are no buckets to put your shells. Everything just goes on the table. The gloves are also very cheap and thin that you can feel the food burning through. When you take your gloves off, you'll also realize the sauce seeps right through and your fingers are dirty. Totally defeats the whole purpose of wearing the gloves. The calamari is dry and not as amazing as I expected. However, the shrimp was very fresh...we ordered two pounds of it. My dad thought the catfish po'boy sandwich was the best. Overall, we'd had better seafood with the same concept but perhaps for las vegas, it is something different and delicious for folks nearby. I do recommend to try The Boil in New York though! This just isn't a place I would go out of my way to come if I came back to Vegas."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try and I honestly left without the most important thing.. a full stomach. This was my first time going here and I ordered 3 pounds of crawfish which were 10.99/pound. I ordered two of the Hot N Juicy flavors and 1 pound of Louisiana. The crawfish were large and it was messy and everything I thought when it came to eating them. Only one of my bags had a piece of corn while the other two pounds just had crawfish. I ate them the traditional way where I ate the tail meat and sucked the heads. I ordered butter which was 1 dollar extra. The problem I guess I have is the amount of meat that come from crawfish and the amount of money that will be spent on the amount it takes at least me to get \"full\" is not worth the price of admission. Other than that the main thing the crawfish were actually good and you come for those.. so give it a try .. but make sure you get those bags filled with more corn."}
{"text":"Always so delicious and smells amazing. Anything with the Hawaiian rolls to help sop up the savory juices from the food makes it better."}
{"text":"As a Boiling Crab fan, I had to finally try out Hot N' Juicy. Have to say I didnt see a huge difference in the two food wise. Hot N' Juicy has really nice, good quality seafood. Tried the shrimp and king crab. Both were very good, fresh, juicy, good seasoning.   The main difference I saw in this place and Boiling Crab was the space and the wait. Waited about 20 minutes to be seated on a Monday night. Also the interior is a bit small and cramped. That means when it is full its quite loud and you have people sort of packed in all around you. Add in the music and it can get pretty loud. Also, can be sort of weird to have a big crowd of waiting people watching you as you eat. On the other hand the service was incredibly friendly. They greeted us immediately upon entering and our server was very good. Give Emeli a raise!  Overall, not much of a difference between the two besides the space and noise level. Hot N' Juicy seems to have good quality seafood, good service, decent prices (perhaps a tad more than Boiling Crab). Really just depends on your preferred location and whether you mind the wait."}
{"text":"1st time for me and the Wife in Vegas, and I was told that I had to try this place. Although we weren't super hungry, we stopped by on our last night in town. We originally started \"light\" with 1Lb of King Crab and 1/2 Lb of shrimp but ended up enjoying our meal to the point where we had to have more. Even though we were rushing to catch a show, we could not resist ordering another round of the very flavorful crab in the Hot N Juicy seasoning with some corn fritters on the side. The seasoning is sooo good that you will want to sop it all up with everything in site. Awesome place to go if you like seafood with a kick! Yum!"}
{"text":"Don't love it but don't dislike it either. I think there are better crawfish places but this will do for my stay in Vegas. Coming from Houston, we have more varieties and better quality crawfish places available. The flavor was on point but the crawfish itself was quite disappointing. It was mushy and tastes odd. A few of them even tastes rotten to me or perhaps it was already dead. However, I do like their boiled shrimps! jumbo boiled shrimp in a hot & spicy sauce.. definitely succulent. I've been to this establishment in Orlando before and it was amazing there so I was hoping for the same wow factor here  but didn't get it. I'll try again the next time I visit Vegas because I have high hopes for this restaurant."}
{"text":"Hot, Juicy and you will be working for your food at this place. Hahaha!   What a cool experience at Hot N Juicy Crawfish.  I have to say that I did have a good time once I got the hang of this place.    If you're a Booshie Chic like me, be ready to get down and dirty and work for your food.  Luckily, I was with a bunch guy friends and colleagues who were more than happy to help me crack my crab legs and peel my shrimp.    I'm not a crawfish lover but I love Crab.  The Crab Legs were yummy delicious.   The food all comes out in a plastic bag all steamed, hot and spicy.   The appetizers were yummy too.   Now this place only serves Beer and sodas.  No alcohol and no wine. So that's one less Star.  Other than that everything was great.  After getting the hang of it, I finally was able to fill my belly and keep up with the guys.   Ambiance is nice and the staff was very helpful and accommodating.    Forks up on Hot N Juicy.  I'll be back this summer!"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!! It is so yummy!   Just a heads up, sometimes the wait is long but there's another location down street.   Another heads up, don't dress up because when you leave here... Well, your gonna smell like this place HaHaHa   Don't say I didn't warn you :)"}
{"text":"With Shrimp being my Favorite, this place is the best place for It. I am in love with the lemon pepper (no spice) it's sooooo yummy!!!!!   Down side of thing is... I hope you don't have anywhere important to go After you eat here because you clothes will smell so bad lol :)"}
{"text":"I have to start off by saying that I may be a bit biased since I looooooooooovvvvvvveeee boiling crab.   After we landed, our first stop was to drop off our luggage at our hotel and then we jumped into a cab \"hot n' juicy please!\" This place isn't too far from the strip, a 5-10 minutes ride from where we were staying [venetian], about a $10.00 cab fare. When we arrived there were only a table or two dining which got us worried since we're used to boiling crab always being packed. As we were overlooking the menu I noticed that they serve blue moon, which deserves extra brownie points!   We ordered 2 pounds of the shrimp in their hot n' juicy sauce which is a combination of all their sauces, cajun fries, and an order of rice. [FYI: you can't order half pounds here ]The food took quite a while to come out, but once we got to eating we noticed that the shrimp were wayyy over cooked. The skin and heads of the shrimp were falling off, and some pieces of shrimp were definitely too soft for my liking. We were probably only able to get through a pound-if that, of our order. But their sauce weren't too bad, definitely better than most places I've tried, but definitely doesn't live up to boiling crab's whole shabang sauce.   All in all, this place isn't bad; if I'm ever in Las Vegas having major shrimpas cravings I wouldn't mind coming back."}
{"text":"When this first opened it pretty much didn't have much competition, that is no longer true. We have eaten there numerous times and the food is good. We love the crab, so sweet and meaty, even the snow crab. The sausage is perfect, crisp skin and just the right amount of spice. The etouffee is yummy, it actually tastes like the one I had in New Orleans. The fries are good, not really spicy though.  We never had the lobster there, just figured crab was their thing.  My only issue is the explanation of the spice level is sort of off. I can eat very spicy food, but for some reason, maybe due to the messiness, I get cuts all over my mouth from the peppers. On my second visit, I even downgraded the spice level, but yet again the same occurrence. I tend to now stay close to mild. Maybe I have sensitive skin, I don't know. Never the less, it's always a very good meal. But we have had better now. Don't get me wrong it's awesome food. Service is hit or miss. They are just so busy. But even really busy I have had an awesome male server.  These are my negatives 1.) What is up with the tiny, tiny plastic ramekin for all those fries?? Seriously? Every time I go I have to ask for ketchup like 6 times and every single time (with exception of that awesome guy server we had) they bring 1 tiny, tiny ramekin. I don't consider myself the queen of common sense but I feel like I am dealing with servers that might not have the sense of urgency and common sense gene! If you are busy, wouldn't you just say  \"F it, let me bring her the freaking bottle, because I don't have time for crazy ketchup lady!! \" ?  But no, again comes that plastic ramekin of 1 tablespoon of ketchup. Oh, OK I have calmed down, please excuse my rant. I guess I didn't realize how upset I was about the ketchup, I will get over it and move on. ( I don't mean to offend any of those servers they do work hard and service really isn't bad) Plus, I haven't been there in a few months, so maybe things have changed.  Negative #2) The seating is a little congested for my liking. Tables are way to close together. I do understand it's a small place, so it's to be expected. But for me, when I want to relax and enjoy a meal this venue isn't appetizing to me.  3.) 2 restrooms, again it's limited spacing so I understand. But it doesn't mean I like it. And no bar to wait until your table is ready. Maybe I am spoiled. I don't like sitting, if you are lucky to get a seat ,Like I am waiting for a bus outside.  Well, in conclusion, is it good food.? Yes it's great! I chose to come here when the negatives are not going to bother me. When I am hungry and want to grub and I don't care who sees or what I see!"}
{"text":"If you are going to call your place Hot & Juicy then you can't serve Luke warm food.  We ordered a pound each of black mussels, shrimp, and crawfish.  The mussels came out 20 minutes later at room temperature, except for one that was somehow ice cold.  I can't figure out how they pulled that off.  As for the shrimp and crawfish, I can't say because our bill arrived before they did so I just had them remove it so we could get to the hockey game.  We got the standard apology along with the excuse that they were behind because it was so busy.   I guess they would prefer an empty restaurant so they could provide better service.  I was really looking forward to this visit because I like the concept and love fresh seafood.  I suppose I will have to continue looking for a good experience because I don't think this place is capable of delivering."}
{"text":"This place was pretty decent.  I couldn't believe there is a place like this in Vegas.  The service was good and the food was decent.  I did smell like garlic for days though.  I will go back, but it's not first on my list."}
{"text":"I've been going to Boiling Crab since I'm from socal and this place is just as good, if not better!! To me, the seasoning is right on par with BC. The one thing I love about this place is that their crawfish are always huge! I've come here a couple times already and every time I come (around lunch time), there is no wait, which is a plus. Definitely recommend this place if you're craving some tasty, flavorful crawfish :)"}
{"text":"Second or third time here, if ypu haven't been, you order by the pound, pick a sauce/flavor, pick the level of spice.   This time we got lucky no waiting, we ordered a lot, one pound clams, two pounds green muscles, two pounds shrimp, one pound crab, medium heat and spicy! All very good, love that they offer gloves now, it's messy eatting but soooo good!  Service was good, food good, beer cold! Hard to find parking, this location is busy!"}
{"text":"OMG this place SUCKS! Its NOTHING COMPAIRED TO BOILING CRAB  1st... the shimp is over cooked..too soft  2nd...the seasoning is soo watered down..and it gives the shrimp no flavor at all  3rd...the \"cajun fries\" suck.. its has barely no seasoning  4th..the corn sucks.. it taste just like KFC corn  ..and adam richman was here?!..sorry man vs food guy u gotta come down to the OC n go to boiling crab"}
{"text":"5 stars for the food, no good as for the service... BEST SHRIMP AND MUSSELS I've EVER had! Hands down!! Garlic butter and the Hot N Juicy is AMAZING. But the service is incredibly slow. I work In the food industry so I'm usually very leaniant because I understand but this is kinda crazy. Our waiter is very nice and friendly but we wanted to put in another order and we didn't see him for about 20 minutes or so. We got our second round of shrimp and mussels and it tasted NOTHING like the first time. Sauce was very thick and pasty. Water tasted terrible, so I'd stick to a fountain drink or a cocktail. All in all, I'll be back again but still slightly disappointed"}
{"text":"I love Cajun seafood. I love Asian spicy....this was terrible!  $30 lobster was so over cooked I gave up it was so tough  Paid extra 75 cents for garlic butter.  It wasn't butter at all!?!??!  It was Garlic and OIL!!!!  I asked the waitress and she admitted they didn't have butter....really? For a $30 lobster!???  Étouffée was BURNT - truly, black flakes in it   Sampled the crawfish, but did not buy.  Small and mushy   Corn on the cob?  Totally mushy and tasteless  Shrimp, actually pretty good  Friend had the catfish.   More breading  than fish....tasteless except for the rancid oil taste  The food?  The server was very nice and tried to please.  We were not high maintenance   Both of us felt sick afterward.  Sunday morning diarrhea   Not cool!   This is NOT a good place to eat!  Com'mon owners. Serve decent food, or at least edible food that doesn't make your customers sick"}
{"text":"Unique concept with a nice menu that's bundled into a great location. I had the spicy boiled crawfish and I'm very impressed with their food- great blend of flavor and quality.   Only thing that I didn't like was the service. Epic service failure."}
{"text":"The waiter was good but the hostess did not provide good service. I had called to verify where they were located since it was was not easy to find. The hostess who answered the phone and was the same person who greeted us was a bit rude and unfriendly. Food was reasonably priced and was good. It was not easy to find."}
{"text":"Best shrimp I've ever eaten ...and I've had shrimp from NoLa New York Boston Jamaica Guyana Florida u get the point... Worth the wait"}
{"text":"My first time at Hot and Juicy was mostly great. The Hot and Juicy sauce is incredible, and the corn soaked in that sauce may be the best corn I have ever had. I had 2lbs of crawfish and in medium Hot and Juicy sauce. Really liked it, though would probably go with shrimp to it is easier to eat next time. My wife and oldest loved the crab and shrimp they had in garlic butter.   My two younger kids were not as impressed. First, my son's fried shrimp (not the most complicated order) got lost, not once but twice. He got his food nearly 30 minutes after we had gotten ours. Also, my youngest really had a hard time finding something she really liked. It was ok for kids, but probably a better place for adults.   Overall, very great place to spend Father's Day with my family and our friends and their kids. But communication between servers and kitchen needs to be better. The food came out very inconsistently for all of us over a 10-minute period, let alone the completely unacceptable handling of my son's meal."}
{"text":"My family loves this place. We get a 1lb shrimp each, rice, rolls, and corn. Got to get the hot n juicy flavor. If you like spicy get the spicy! Wait times are not too long. Service is good. I don't suggest you dress nice because you will get dirty even with your bib."}
{"text":"I tried this after watching Man vs. Food (seen it before but never really gave it a thought). Good place to try!  Not a fan of the actual crawfish (we had 1 lb. garlic butter)...but LOVED the shrimp (we had a lb. of that as well).  We also ordered sausage/corn (all ala carte).  The starches they offer are rice bolws (1.75 a pop), and potato (boiled or french fries).  The sodas were free refills.  We actually went w/mild (which still had a bit of spiciness).  It was messy, but if you wear the bib...you are good to go!  They offer: king crab, snow, and other seafoods (menu says market price).  When we ordered, both the crawfish and shrimp were 9.99 p/lb.  For 2 people, average price is about $40 (w/drinks & tip).  Parking can be congested.  Either go early (to avoid dinner crowed) or go later (like about 8-ish).  Dining area is small...most tables only accomodates 4 ppl at the most.  I don't recommend for small children (the garlic is really strong), they don't have a children's menu.  We weren't thrilled, but we were satisfied w/our meal.  BEWARE: Garlic taste lasts a good 48 hours!!!"}
{"text":"There are 8 pieces in 1/2 lb of shrimp at $1.12 a piece. Our Po' Boy was dry with not enough of anything inside. Our 1.6 lb lobster wasn't worth it at $45. The service wasn't great either, we were never checked on. The experience at Hot and Juicy is always fun but food and service is lacking."}
{"text":"Placed a Togo order and they said it'll be done in 35 min, but it was actually 1hr and 10 min. Walked in to pick it up but since it wasn't ready, the cashier said she'll bring it out to us. Another 15 min and we had to walk in and check on it. It was just sitting on the counter.   If you say you're gonna do something, do it.. Don't make people wait. One star for the crawfish itself, but the service was horrible.   Not to mention, we could've walked out with free food because she didn't even know we paid or not.. This place needs to really train their staff."}
{"text":"Tasty! Got the snow crab, lobster, clams and others. Fun eating messy! The seafood was fresh and tasty. Maybe pricier than other similar restaurants (like Angry Crab) but service was good-- friendly and prompt. Only way con would be smaller space and limited seating. Overall fun and good place to eat!"}
{"text":"For starters, crab legs are nice size. Great spicy flavor.  Went for my birthday it was amazing food"}
{"text":"My coworkers and I went here for birthday celebration and it is our first time to come here so we thought we'd try the food. Most of us ordered shrimp just different spiciness level. When one of us got the shrimp he ordered he saw a battery inside the plastic with the shrimp. We took the this picture before we call the manager. Good thing he looked at it first before he starts to eat it. Another that is upsetting is they still charged our friend. It was shocking to see a battery on your food. So check it first before you eat it."}
{"text":"Good little spot if you dont feel like boiling up your own seafoods. it is what it is really can say much. the food is fresh reasonably priced and it has options.   The staffing could use a little more help with promptness as well as friendliness. I think most of them are there just to make some cash but it should also be about the customer too!"}
{"text":"Decided to do carry out this time. ***Didn't know they offered this***  Hot n juicy always comes through. Ordered 2.5lbs of shrimp, 1lb of snow crab, sausage and rice.  Shrimp was seasoned with HnJ medium. (Shrimp was possibly not in season as there were a few mushy textured pieces (reason for 4 stars).   Crab was seasoned with the same HnJ medium and was fine no mushy texture.  Sausage was added to the shrimp and was great  Rice was just good ole rice  All in all a great idea to take it home if you don't mind your car smelling like garlic and seafood for the next 3 days haha"}
{"text":"I am sorry i have to say good bye to my crawfish eating ways. i can no longer eat these little creatures because of the toll that it taking on my health. I will miss drinking/ slurping the sauce like a water on a super hot day. i love this place because they serve rice. im asian and you know i love the rice. please tell me how six girls can consume 12lbs of crawfish. i still dont know. goodbye crawfish i will definitely miss you."}
{"text":"My husband and I were able to try this amazing restaurant for the first time last night and were extremely please with our experience!  Service: The servers were super friendly right out the gate. They were very accommodating and sweet enough to teach us all about the craziness we were about to experience that was hot and juicy! They constantly check on our table and always made sure we had enough to drink.  Food: after we learned a little bit about how the menu work, we decided to try a pound of the shrimp since they were out of blue crab and also the Cajun fries and Creole calamari. Everything was extremely delicious and the space was on point for the spicy shrimp. My only hope, and being the fitness girl, was that there was some kind of salad or greens option which was the only thing missing from the menu-I have to remember that not everything can be healthy  Experience: we have eaten crab legs before in the comfort of our own home but it was really fun to experience hot and juicy with the plastic bib and the plastic gloves and the nonuse of utensils-it was like being a big kid out in public! Everything was awesome and we definitely want to come back when they have more seafood in stock so that we can try out the entire menu."}
{"text":"It taste great, just wish the shrimp didn't still have the poop in them. I wish the had more locations spread around town."}
{"text":"Food was good and the place was packed but the service was horrible and when it came time for the bill asked for cash do they wouldn't get charged for using their card machine!!!  Then I didn't get my change, they just put it in their tip jar!! I had to ask for it and dug it out their jar in front of me!! As a foodie, great food, as a person who has been in the food and hospitality field for 10 years, bad FOH staff!!"}
{"text":"They have the best spices! Loved the experience and our waitress was very polite and nice. Ill be visiting again soon"}
{"text":"If you were familiar with garlic favor , it would be suitable for you enjoy this restaurant."}
{"text":"Hot N Juicy is a located right in the middle of Westgate, restaurant is clean and speedy.  Food; Got the Snow Crab Legs Hot n Juicy with Medium Flavor, the heat was perfect.  The crab was delicious.  Service;  Our server was friendly and outgoing, received hot food in a timely manner."}
{"text":"Food was great! Nice variety of spice and heat. Can have without spices... had the drool and it was enough for 2. Fresh food and great service."}
{"text":"This is a tradition for me and Chrissy whenever we are in Vegas.  Beer n soda selection is weak but the food is top notch.  Shrimp, crawfish, crab.....AMAZING.  We have yet to have something bad and eat pounds....yes pounds of food every time we go.  Lot's of flavors to choose from.....but we get hot n juicy mild or spicy.  DELICIOUS.  This is a must eat destination in Vegas."}
{"text":"Hot and Mushy is more like it!  This place is WAY over priced, and they do NOT stand behind their food.  We live in a neighborhood of friends, and often get together on a Friday night and order something fun.  Many times it has been Hot and Juicy.  This week we ordered hot and juicy for pickup.  We ordered 13 lbs... 11 lbs of shrimp, and 2 lbs. of crawfish.  The shrimp were inedibly mushy when we got them home.  Luckily, I had defrosted a bunch of king crab legs an lobster tails from Costco.  This higher quality seafood saved the day, and the party.  We called hot and juicy the next day to see if they would refund the money for the shrimp, and that we would gladly bring back the mushy shrimp.  It took 4-5 calls and many hilarious conversations dealing with several of the 20-something children who seem to run the place. One girl said \"for the future, I would ask them to put no more than a lb. per bag.  The shrimp are fickle\"  Really, young child??  As if we are the ones who packed all of the shrimp in one bag!  I'm not at all convinced the amount per bad has any bearing, but she shed all responsibility, saying she doesn't have the authority to give a refund. After a few more calls with other little girls who had no authority, we finally got a hold of a manager, since the owner is apparently too important to deal with his customers.  He offered a 5% discount on our next order.  when we promised to write the story on Yelp, he upped it to 10%.  The problem is, I don't want disgusting mushy shrimp paste nastiness at any price.  The manager said \"I checked with the 'chef' (I'd call him a cook at best) and he said that they were cooked perfectly\".  Did he?  Hahaha!  Of course he said that. I have 10 people, one a sous chef at a restaurant in the Bellagio, who beg to differ.  The manager also practically accused us of lying when we told him we order from there often saying \"well, I don't see an order history on your card\". This, after we had already mentioned that a different person in our group of 10 picks up the food each time. Some of us pay cash.  This place is damned sure not worth the wait, and certainly not worth the exorbitant prices they charge.  They just lost a ton of business from all of us and everyone we know, and don't seem to care at all.  They simply don't stand behind their product at all, so why should we?  Order at your own risk!"}
{"text":"Crab is amazing! Hot and Juicy Special Medium is amazing on everything. It is my nephew's favorite place in Vegas."}
{"text":"Just got done eating and I am stuffed. The food was really good.  Food was good but the service was even better. Thank you DAVID!!! Make sure to ask for him when you go, he went above and beyond for us. I will definitely be back to see DAVID.."}
{"text":"Catfish was good crawfish was ok service was not good at all not going to recommend this place to anyone"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE Hot N' Juicy Crawfish. I honestly prefer this over Boiling crab.. Their sauce is perfect! Boiling crab is really good too, but it's oilier compared to Hot N' Juicy. H&J's sauce is thick and goes perfectly with some steamed rice. Eat that ish with yo hands village style, straight from the table! cause it tastes better that way.  I find myself craving H&J alllllllllll the time!   The reason I'm not giving them 5 stars is because BC has their seasoned fries and catfish/shrimp basket on LOCK. if you've never had it, it's a must try over there.  Also, I've had a bad oyster here before, and had severe stomach pains... I didn't know it was bad because I've never had a bad oyster before, but when that excruciating pain kicked in, I knew it was that last oyster I had right away. It tasted really bad too, but I just swallowed it quickly as a natural impulse. (that's what she said!)  I would still come back of course, I love hot n' juicy, but owners, if you're reading this, please make sure you train your staff well enough to differentiate bad oysters vs good ones.   Until next time H&J.. I will be dreaming about dat sawwwwwwse."}
{"text":"I've been to a few Hot N Juicy's and have enjoyed the experience. However, this time wasn't one of those times. In the first place, the name of the restaurant is Hot N Juicy Crawfish and they didn't have any Crawfish. This is not a good sign...we then ordered oysters, typically they have blue points, this day they had Canadian oysters, they were unbelievably small, tasteless, very expensive and a big mistake to get. We shared our displeasure, they didn't care. We also ordered the soft shell crab, a bit pricey for what you get, but pretty good. The three of us got the shrimp and it was very good. The service was very good. For what we paid, I can't see us going back.... it's just not that good."}
{"text":"We came to eat here after our stint with exotic cars at LV Motor Speedway. My friend saw Hot N Juicy Crawfish in Man vs. Food. Good Cajun seafood. Definitely better than salty Boiling Crab but just a tad behind our local Ray's Crab. We had 2lbs of shrimp, 2bls of clams, sweet potato fries, and rice. I liked their clams the best; tender and delightful. Big plus on their servers that could definitely strike up some conversation.   What I like the most is that their hot is hot and not watered down. Its definitely a tingling sensation in my palette that is delightful and pleasing. I am pretty sure their spicy could be a workout.   We will probably be back if we desire hot cajun seafood and we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"My wife wanted to get off the strip at least once while we were in town. She read about Hot N Juicy on Yelp and decided it would be the best place to go.  We made sure to beat the dinner rush and enjoyed a couple of pounds of shrimp and crawfish.   Definitely get everything Hot N Juicy style, and if you like only a little spice, don't feel like a wimp getting the mild, that is still got quite a bit of kick."}
{"text":"Love Love lovve this place!!! My boyfriend and I eat here once a week. Even their servers call us their regulars and they know us by our first names. When I first tried this place I ordered the crawfish. I now get a pound of shrimp because the shrimp has more meat and it's easier to peel than the crawfish.   What is so great about this place is their special sauce..hot and juicy special! I get it medium spice level, if I do spicy (which I have) my lips start to puff up. But the medium is still pretty spicy. I've also had their snow crab, Alaskan crab, Cajun fries, sweet potato fries...all very good.   BEWARE you will smell like garlic after leaving this place. And your fingers will smell for two days. The secret to getting the smell out of your fingers is to rub lemon juice after u are done (and I mean a lot of lemon juice).  They are opening a second location which I am very excited for! Their staff is very friendly too.  also the wait is pretty long but well worth it!"}
{"text":"We didnt try Hot N Juicy until this year, and now we eat here regularly every week. The shrimp, crawfish, sausage, fries etc are delicious. We have gradually been increasing the spice level, medium is pretty decent, we are heading towards the next level.  The service at this location is really good, when we are lucky enough to get Michelle, its amazing, we love her. I highly suggest eating here, try the Get your feet wet mild for the sensitive, and go higher for the adventurous."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last night and it was outstanding ! Draya, Olena, and Juan made the experience even better by their great customer service ! Will definitely go back !"}
{"text":"If you want to get your hands dirty this is the spot!  Crab & beer, no frills, but very good."}
{"text":"Only 'local place' I've found for great & messy crab.  The 'hot n juicy sauce' is on the spicier side so go mild before you go hot.  Snow crab, king crab, corn and potato...you are good to go!"}
{"text":"Okay so I live in New Orleans, and even I still prefer Hot N Juicy over any seafood place I've tried in Nola. This place is absolutely delicious and a wonderful experience for your whole family! Be prepared to get messy, even though they do give you gloves and a bib! Mostly everything is served family style, where you can order your seafood by the 1/2 or full pound, and choose the flavor and level of spice. We usually order a few pounds of shrimp, a pound of mussels, an order of catfish and an order of calamari to share among 6 people! They're supposedly famous for their crawfish which is their logo, but personally I prefer the shrimp which is way easier to shell, and way more worth it since you get about 4x as much meat in each piece. Their catfish also comes with fries that you can upgrade to Cajun flavor, and they also have delicious sweet potato fries! We usually spend around $15 per person once you break it down, which isn't too bad for the variety of seafood and the fun experience of it! My favorite flavor combo is the garlic butter mild, and don't forget to add some corn on the cobs that they'll cook right in with your seafood! They come out in plastic bags and you eat straight on the table so you'll have an absolute mess afterwards so don't be alarmed, but it's worth it and is an absolute favorite of almost all our relatives visiting from out of town!"}
{"text":"Ok so let's talk about Hot N Juicy...by now in case you do not know let me inform you that I am from Louisiana. So...my standards for all things seafood and coined as Cajun or creole are through the roof high. My favorite season of the year is CRAWFISH SEASON. I live for mud bugs and all cuisine Cajun and creole. I could go on and on talking about how no food is better than what we have in Louisiana but I will spare you at this time. So, Hot N Juicy....they don't have high rating for nothing! My friends and I needed a crawfish fix and this spot was literally across the street from where we were staying. We ordered: crawfish, corn, fish platters, shrimp po boy, Cajun fries, sweet potato fries, and deep fried brownies. Almost forgot to throw in the snow crab legs. We got our seafood medium heat and seasoned in Hot N Juicy. The spice kick was just right. The seasoning stuck. It was nose running, lip burning glory! Since moving to Cali where the food has been subpar at best, Hot N Juicy was a nice change of pace for me tastebuds. I now have to see if the one in West Hollywood ranks in close comparison. The service was good. Our server kept our glasses full and made sure all was well. The prices were at market value. I cannot complain about market prices but what I can say is in Louisiana we are fortunate enough to get seafood for much less. Typically crawfish is sold at $2.99/lb live and depending  on time of season cooked ranges from $3.99-7.99/lb. I understand a business has to make a profit and it is not like crawfish are being plunked out the water in the west. Thank goodness home is only a short plane ride up the road.  I said all this to say...eat Hot N Juicy."}
{"text":"Perfectly cooked & perfectly spiced soft shell crab (no sauce necessary) & crawfish (Louisiana seasoning)   My boyfriend is from New Orleans and he said it's the best he has had in AZ and for that matter many places in NOLA.   Service was beyond great and super friendly. Love it so much we will likely come back every Sunday."}
{"text":"I would have to say my favorite place in all of Henderson/Vegas area.  The Hot and Juicy special sauce is like crack. I love seafood and the sauce just makes it that much better.  I've been a regular at this place for the last year.  I've become friendly with the management and all the staff. I have not had a bad experience yet.   The oysters with their special red sauce are some of the best I have ever had. I've had expensive oysters at fancy steakhouses not as good. I've pretty much tried everything in the restaurant at this point but my favorites are the oysters, clams, snow crab and occasionally i will get crawfish if I am in the mood.    It will be hard for me to ever leave Henderson/Vegas and move somewhere else that does not have one of these restaurants.  In fact I just ate their last night and I still crave it again today.    I first tried the place after seeing Man vs Food on TV. Noemy who was featured on the show still works there. She is super cool, very friendly manager.  I just tried it by chance to say I went there. I had no idea how addicting it would become. The management is great. They always treat us good at all 3 locations in Vegas area.   The only advice I can give you is to wear a bib, wear gloves because you will get messy.  You will smell like the sauce the rest of the night even still so don't plan on leaving your house without showering like 7x.    I usually take all my friends/family that visit me to this place when they are in town when they just want to kick back and have a few beers and eat some good food."}
{"text":"DELISH!  Reasonably priced, make sure to wear comfy clothes (you will need to pull your sleeves up and wash your cloths right after), spicier than average (so you may want to order a spice lower than usual on your first try), service was ehh but they were SUPER busy, parking sucks, bathrooms are eh..  But what can I say, it definitely hits the spot when you are looking for a crawfish joint."}
{"text":"Visiting my sister for Labor Day , & of course checking this new location out , I've been to their first location yrs back & it was bomblicious & pack .  This new location is bigger clean & our server was nice which is a plus , when our crawfish & shrimp , sausages,  corn arrive  .  We dig in , it was blasting full of flavor not too spicy but sweet garlic mouth watering  seafood , now I don't know who's the winner from boiling crab / or Hot n juicy crawfish ."}
{"text":"Boiling crab is far better than Hot n Juicy. service was very mediocre and the shrimp that we ordered was too soft, almost a \"mushy\" type of texture. A little over priced compared to Boiling crab. Environment @ BC is much more friendlier. Food portion is much less generous than BC and overall i was very dissatisfied. If you don't like sweet in your shrimp, and prefer a more savory and bold flavor, go to boiling crab, other wise, Hot n Spicy isn't the place for ya!"}
{"text":"Looking for a fantastic seafood boil while in Vegas? This place is the winner! Seafood you order by the pound and add your choice of sauce and spice level. You can also go with a pre-selected feast that includes corn, sausage, and potatoes. We opted to order by the pound, and got shrimp, crawfish, and blue crab. Sauced it up with garlic butter and mild spice (still definitely some heat with the mild! ). All choices were soooo good. I should also mention that the fried calamari we shared is the best I've had. It was perfect! You're definitely gonna get messy here so they give you bibs and gloves to help keep you from looking like you just swam in a vat of cajun butter, as delicious as THAT sounds. Definitely check out this place, worth every penny!"}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure this place always has a wait, but it wasn't too bad when we went. The smell was overwhelming and delicious as we waited for our table. I saw mainly Asians, and wondered why. Are these people from out of town or are they locals? Anyhow, it was definitely worth our short 25 minute (instead of the 15 quoted) wait for our hot n juicy seafood. We ordered some shrimp, crab, corn and potatoes. All were delicious, and our waitress was helpful in verbally assisting two crab dissecting virgins. We got through the meal happy, and with one cut on my finger, nothing too bad. I would definitely, absolutely, positively recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"This is my second time i come to eat here. The food is great . The place is a little dirty but only cause you eat wiyh your hands and dont use plates. They rated yhis rest in vegas weekly and got great reviews. Definately everytime we come this rest is a must. Also this rest came out on man vs food"}
{"text":"Awesome place great food from shrimp to crawfish, I love the juicy Louisiana, great spice and heat....service was alright it's my second time going and they are always busy. Parking sucks because it's so busy there's just not enough of it. Not a long wait time to get seated and and service was fast to the table but then got a little slow. But the food made up for everything, I don't like eating with my hands but it was too good. I will definitely be going back soon......"}
{"text":"Our server Rebecca was so sweet! And also the entire staff! They got us exactly everything we needed.  I ordered a pound of crawfish , shrimp and clams hot n juicy medium flavor. The crawfish was in season yay!!!"}
{"text":"I had a great experience at this restaurant. The food was great and the service was even better. I think her name was Shelby. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"OK, I'm not a Las Vegas local (even though my 2 brothers-in-law are).  So I found about Hot N Juicy from TV, specifically Travel Channel's Man Vs Food.  Knowing that this place was been made famous from this show, I came here for lunch on Friday of my last Vegas visit.  We met one of my brothers-in-law for lunch here, arriving in the parking lot 5 minutes before 12 noon.  Even though the restaurant wasn't even open yet, there were over a dozen people waiting outside the door already!    Once the staff let the horde in, we were seated right away and given menus.  As this is an Asian-owned establishment, I recommend not ordering all spicy seasoning, unless you can power through the heat.  Here's what I ordered for our party of 3:  1 pound of shrimp, with Garlic Butter, mild spice 1 pound of crawfish, Louisana Style, medium spice 1 order of Calamari 1 order of Sweet Potato Fries  The fries and calamari came out first; they were good and hot, but not exceptional.  But when the shrimp and crawfish arrived, the real feast began.  The shrimp were big, and the sauce was mild and tasty.  And while the crawfish were cooked in a \"medium\" sauce, it was plenty hot for me and my dining companions.  Just be careful not to suck the sauce too quickly; it will clear up your sinuses in a hurry!  Just like any of these seafood boil places, be ready to get down and dirty.  They have lobster bibs and full rolls of paper towels on the tables for a reason!  Overall, this was one of our favorite meals in Las Vegas.  It's in Chinatown and pretty far away from the Strip, so rent a car to get here."}
{"text":"I hate HATE crawfish!  But it's messy filthy fun date.  You're offered a bib and U get pounds of crap thrown on ur table and just get messy!  If u like crawfish GOGOGO MUST GO!  I just hate u can see the feces that you are eating!  Barf Out!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat a pound of shrimp. Crab legs are also a fav. I had the pleasure of eating at the Westgate location"}
{"text":"Great shellfish selection.  It is important that you understanding your preference for spicy level and how that translates to their heat scale is critical. A mix of all the flavors and spicy is not a good look. The flavor becomes confusing essentially cancelling each other out. I enjoy spicy food but the individual flavors (Cajun, garlic, etc...) medium spicy is best here. None spicy is best for older folks and children. The spiciness affected my digestion.  Bring plastic gloves because the sauces are wet can linger on your finger."}
{"text":"No meat for me, just seafood during this Lent. So, it was my first time at Hot N Juicy Crawfish. 5 Stars for the cheerful service, the promptness in cleaning up the tables, and for the amazing food!  Yum!!  It was really good.  I'm coming back again."}
{"text":"This was my first time going, best decision I made, I was expecting less food due to sea food being expensive, but prices aren't that bad, took my family with me. Make sure you get the right portion, it's allot of food, thanks to our server we took her advice. We are definitely going back again soon."}
{"text":"I love seafood, and even better...seafood with seasoning!  Can't get enough of this place.  I come here everytime I go to Vegas.  Looking forward to going again next month! :)"}
{"text":"Pretty much one of the few reasons why I keep coming back to Vegas.   If you love spicy food and seafood you should consider moving in next door because this will be a need in life you can't help but want more.   The service is great doesn't matter how busy it gets. The restaurant is the perfect size. And the food is just incredible. The price is amazing for the quality and quantity.   I am in love with all the flavours with that being said I can't pick my favourite. If you don't want things to get too messy because you don't like wearing gloves when eating you can definitely request to have the sauce on the side (you're playing it too safe. Stop that, it's boring).  By far one of my favourite spot for seafood and if you haven't been you really are missing out.   P.s. The best corn I've ever had in life is from here (yes I thought that was an important piece of information that I needed to share)"}
{"text":"This is our first time and we were actually heading for another place when we decided to take a look. This is real Louisiana Style food. Crawfish was as the name says, Hot and Juicy. Large shrimp with the heads still on. Soft shell crab with fries were a hit with my grandson. Tables covered with plastic, bibs, and plastic gloves tells you this is going to be messy. This is eat with your hands fun.  We plan to come back. If you have not checked this place out yet you should put this on your got to go list."}
{"text":"I'm originally from Louisiana where crawfish boils and Mardi gras are equally looked forward to as any other major event or holiday and being new to Vegas, Hot n Juicy was a welcome find. The crawfish was as delicious as any I've had back home. The Louisiana medium spice was perfect! Gem, our waitress, rocked! Thanks for everything!!! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Stuffed! Go hungry to this place! A lb of shrimp is A LOT OF DELICIOUS SHRIMP! Don't forget to order your corn. Super delicious! It's a bit out the way from the strip but totally worth the drive! @hotnjuicycrawfish #lasvegasmusteat #sooooogood !"}
{"text":"Amazing shrimp. We ordered all five flavors. Along with some rolls and andouille sausage you are in for a treat. Get on your gloves, bib and get sum spicy. Great experience."}
{"text":"It is no boiling crab. The spices were a bit off. Service was slow. Our orders mixed up, hence, our bill took some figuring out."}
{"text":"I've never heard of this place (Hot n Juicy Crawfish) until my bf had suggested to check the place out. I went with a couple friends and the bf today to give it a shot. I wasn't expecting so much from it due to the past experience of another place with the same style of food (Angry Crab) that we tried and turned out quite a disappointment in the end.   Surprisingly, Hot n Juicy Crawfish turned out better than I expected. We got here around 3ish so it wasn't busy at all which was perfect cause we didn't want to wait for hours just to be seated. As soon as we were seated the waitress immediately got us started with our drinks. I was pretty impressed with how fast service was and how quickly they got our orders out. The waitresses/ waiters worked as a team and I thought that service was just excellent. It didn't matter who our waitress was because every now and they all took turns checking up on us asking if we needed anything else.   The food was GREAT! We ordered 2 lbs of hot n juicy shrimp, 1lb of snow crab legs, corn & cajun fries. Our friends ordered oysters, clams, and crawfish. They definitely give you good portions of the food; definitely a lot more than what we would have gotten if we went to Angry Crab. The food was fresh and delicious! We were so stuffed we almost didn't finish our food. The place was also very clean.   We had a great first experience at Hot n Juicy. I would recommend checking this place out. :)"}
{"text":"Baby spice would be the ideal choice for mild pallets. They also offer different tastes, if you don't like hot cajuns.  I feel very relaxed and cozy, the lighting is just right.  No obnoxious music playing Bruno mars or lil pump.  - Televisions that display sports."}
{"text":"I am so glad this place opened up near us! Beats going all the way to spring mountain! The seafood here is amazing! I love how they have different flavors and spice levels! Prices are pricy but hey it's seafood! I've been here the first time they opened and trust me I was skeptical about even returning... But I noticed through time they've improved a lot! Service wise. I mean it's always a hit or miss but you need to go in at a certain time when it isn't so busy. I remember one time I came in and it was slow at first and they got slammed out of no where. So our waitress totally forgot about our table and we waited for our check for half an hour when we finished our food less than an hour ago. Anyways, one of the servers there changed my perspective because he was very attentive and kind. Kudos to the gentlemen who loves spices there! He told us a story of how he would put XXXL spice and ghost chili peppers on all his food in the fridge so his roommates wouldn't touch his food. He definitely made our night and I do apologize for not catching your name. Thank you so much though! I will definitely be returning. I can't deny good food!"}
{"text":"I had been fighting coming here for over a year due to the whole Diners, Drive-Ins, & Dives episode hype.  I knew that it would be tough to get a table but I finally gave in and thank God I did.  We stopped by the other location first, looked like an hour wait at 6PM, crazy.  Drove a mile down the street and got the last table at this location which was lucky because after us there was a 20-30 minute wait.  Ordered some shrimp ($10/lb) and dungeness crab ($15/lb).  The shrimp was awesome, serious flavor...make sure you dip them back in the sauce after you shuck them.  A single dungeness crab was $20 and not worth it.  I'll stick to the shrimp next time.  You will definitely want to wear the bib and also some eye protection.  I shot hot 'n juicy sauce in my eye, that sucked.  The food is great and I will definitely be coming back..."}
{"text":"I have a hard time deciding between which one is better between the two: Hot N Juicy Crawfish or the Boiling Crab. Yes, I know there are other establishments in town that involve eating seafood with your bare hands, but these are the only two I've been to so far, and that is where my judgment stands.   I never quite understood the hype of these kinds of joints when I heard all of my friends talking about it. After all, why would I PAY to do more work? I'm the type of person that just wants to eat. However, after eating here a few times, I can see what the hype is about. It's the experience.   It's fun, really. If you haven't tried it yet, those are the only words I can describe it. I'm not too good with my spices, but the butter garlic baby spice hit it right on the dot for me. SOO good.   My table order the King Crab, shrimp, crawfish, and oysters. The oysters they gave were all decent in size and I didn't feel like I was being ripped off with my money.   The legs of the crab were quite big, tasted juicy, but was definitely hard to open, even with the cracker.   I feel like the crawfish could be skipped just because they're so tiny. Not just for this place, but crawfish in general. Unless, you extremely love the taste of prawns, it's more work than what it's worth. But that's just me.   As for the shrimp, it was the big winner here.   My only big gripe is the table we were seated at. We were a group of 5 seated at a table meant strictly for 4 people, and it was definitely uncomfortable having such a tiny eating are to split between us. After all, we did order a lot of food. At times, it also felt like the servers were rushing us with the way they kept checking over us towards the later half. It didn't sit too well with some of my acquaintances."}
{"text":"Food was very very good but the best part of it it had to be my waitress Molly she was great and she even pilled all my shrimp for me ask for Molly and she's gorgeous"}
{"text":"Tonight I placed a phone order for pick up. The young lady who took the order gave me a 15 minute wait time. I get there within the wait time and pay for my order. I sit waiting almost an hour before a waitress sits down next to me; \"We forgot to put your order in. Its going to take another 15-20 minutes and you'll be put in the system for a free meal the next time you order.\" I sat for another 20 minutes and asked for my refund of the money already paid. The cashier began to hesitate like she didn't know what to do. Eventually as they were refunding my money the food came from underneath the counter; not the window where everyone else's food came from. I think this establishment needs a bit more customer service and less texting from their employees."}
{"text":"This review is from Monday.... Forgot to write it then. We went on Monday 03/21/2016 for lunch. Let me just say Mmmmmm good. Great flavor. Got some shrimp, crawfish, corn fritters, catfish, Cajun fries.  Got our shrimp n crawfish in mild flavor. Not too spicy but still was delicious. Catfish was great too. Waaaay over did it. But good food sometimes leads to that. Service was excellent and CUTE ASS waitresses. As one said to me... \"where the waitresses are HOT N the Crawfish are JUICY\" So true!!! Thanks Miranda!! The best kinda place for me. Definitely make this a spot to try. I will be back again for sure. All food was great and flavorful. Service was top notch. Topped everything off with some complmentary fried brownies for desert. Wow!!! It is true that if you deep fry anything it's better. Delicious!! Keep up the great work Miranda and all the staff."}
{"text":"This place sucked servers had attitudes but it's not my fault they were in the weeds. The calamari had no flavor  the hot n juicy sauce wasn't all that great either should've went to maggianos"}
{"text":"This is a must try place, if your looking for something different and unique this is the place to go. I did enjoy the different atmosphere this restaurant offers.  You gotta get your hands dirty that's the fun part about this. The best is the hot and Juicy special sauce and i did enjoy that more with shrimp than Crawfish and it was just awesome with the dungeons crab, which was a little pricey but that's normal for crab. Its all in the sauce i can eat that sauce with anything, it was also great with bread more than rice. Just try this place i don't think you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"Food was good. Service was slow but good. Shared a shrimp po boy with a friend and the fried calamari. Super spicy and good."}
{"text":"Fun place to go.  Service was good and you just eat everything like a viking.  I found the crawfish to be unsatisfying....too much work for such a little amount of meat but good flavor.  We had to order a pound of shrimp after we ordered 2 pounds of crawfish and a pound of blue crab because neither of us felt remotely full.  Everything tasted great though.  But I will only order the shrimp the next time we come here.    As soon as we were leaving, a bunch of poker players (JC Tran, Nam Le, Amnon Fillipi etc) came through the door to eat.  I thought it was interesting that these guys could eat at Picasso every night yet they chose to come here of all the places on a Wednesday night."}
{"text":"I had a pound of shrimp in their original sauce...and their soft shell crab with fries. The shrimp they served were pretty big and juicy and garlicky too.  Tasty!!  Great service too."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to go to this place since seeing it on Man vs. Food. It is always packed, so don't be in a rush when you visit. Plus you will stay there awhile. It smells kind of gross if you aren't used to this sort of thing. The service was very good. Our waitress was helpful as we were on our maiden voyage. The service is the best part of the entire experience.  If you are with others and never had crawfish I would highly recommend to first order one pound then order more if you like them. It is an acquired taste and to tell you the truth I didn't like them. Especially sucking the juice from the head. Blah! I only tried the Special Sauce Mild and found it to actually be very good. I also had shrimp and it was more satisfying after all the work of peeling. Bigger reward at the end not like the tiny reward from crawfish. I was disappointed only because it looked so much better on TV. Would I go back? I highly doubt it as I couldn't get the smell out of my nose and breath for a coupe days. Wearing gloves makes it so hard to peel but saves on the stinkies. Maybe I needed to wash it down with a cold beer but in any case it only gets a 3Star because a 2Star wouldnt be reflective of the awesome service we had from our waitress. Waitress 5Star food was 2star.  UPDATE: As funny as it might seem, I am wanting to go again, but staying away from the Crawfish. Have upped my rating because of the craving."}
{"text":"This place is so good we went two days in a row. It was crawfish season and you can tell they were fresh. The food comes out really quick. The garlic butter spicy is the way to go. Add a side of Cajun fries and oddly enough the wings aren't too shabby either.  On our second day we added a pound of shrimp and glad we did. Delicious! What keeps this place from being a 5 star is the service seems disorganized. Which ever waiter/ress is free will seat you vs. having a host and the set up is its difficult to see the front of the restaurant. The staff also doesn't check on you often so be ready to waive em down. The second attempt was better service.  But the food alone is a definitely repeat. I'd gone a 3rd day but we had to leave town."}
{"text":"Just ok nothing special. Considering that it's at west gate your gonna pay a up charge just for that. I would find a Angry Crab and go there."}
{"text":"If you love shrimp then this is the place to come !! The shrimp is fresh and the whole idea of getting a pound of shrimp is great and on top of that you can pick your seasoning !! We also got the sausage witch is pretty bomb too  I would recommend this place to everyone"}
{"text":"We went there last night 1/9/2016 was the worst dinner I can think of, even Golden Corral has better food than we had.  We had a party of 7, our meal was 2 fried shrimp,1 chicken wing, 1 chicken nugget, 1 seasoned shrimp 1 seasoned crab, and my lobster (worst I have ever had, tough and loaded with garlic). Which I had not requested.  Not one person in our party had an enjoyable meal,  Really disappointing.......spent over $200.00 with tip....tip was eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"Awesome service, great food. It's nice to finally have H&J on my side of town. I got 1lb of shrimp in the special sauce and it was delicious as ever. My only complaint is that I was told you can no longer order a side of extra sauce- but I wound up not needing it and nommed on some corn instead- which was a lovely addition and helped balance out the meal. Very happy about this new location! Wait staff were very friendly, prompt, and attentive."}
{"text":"It was my first time here and I'll be honest, I was skeptical. I have been a \"Boiling Crab\" fan for many years and each time I've gone to other joints, I've been severely disappointed so I've stopped trying.   Our friend Andy recommended this place and seeing that we were crashing at his place, I thought we should at least try it out.  I ordered 1 pound of crawfish medium spicy with their special sauce, 1 order of dungeness crab legs and both were delicious! The sauce was just right, not too oily, had a great garlic flavor. I also ordered a piece of corn to sop up the sauce.   I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone who loves seafood!"}
{"text":"I was surprised how messy the tables looked when I fist stepped into the restaurant. But .. I decided to stay and try and wasn't disappointed. I had shrimps and it was really good.  Will be back some day."}
{"text":"The best crab boil I have ever had! Get the hot n juicy seasoning and you won't be disappointed. Who would think vegas would have great seafood!?"}
{"text":"Oh yeah ! Let's get down and dirty at hot and juicy ... Calm down, let's keep it G rated.   The restaurant is hot and juicy and when you eat here you better not mind getting your hands dirty.   NOTE: they do provide gloves for you, but I think if you're gonna eat here you need to enjoy the experience, I mean how often is it that you're eating with your hands ??  The food is always on point and the flavor is always consistent.   The family and I prefer medium hot and juicy flavor for everything.  Typically we order 2 lbs of crawfish and 2 lbs of shrimp.  Now they offer 1/2 lbs of food too, so that was a nice addition.     Here's the negative side. Man, this place gets busy,especially on holidays or since right now it's lent and on Fridays Catholics can't have meat .. I think they all decide to go to hot and juicy, just like we did.   Over 45 minute wait.  BAD IDEA.     Now I like I said, the food is consistent, so that's fine, but the service seems to go down the drain when they get busy.   It's like chickens running around with their head cut off.  Our bad experience was that we got all our food, but we were missing a bowl of rice.   3 different servers kept telling us \"the rice is coming, the rice is coming.\"  It literally came when we were almost done eating.   How difficult is it to scoop a bowl of rice ?? I can understand if they told me, we actually ran out of rice and we are making a fresh batch, because it took that long for our rice to come.  Drinks take forever to refill, it's just a mess.  I understand they are busy, but they gotta come up with a better plan for busy days.     TIP OF THE DAY:  Just come here on a regular day, you'll get better service and you'll enjoy the food !!"}
{"text":"I definitely love this place!! Hot n juicy style srimp 1 pound defiantly my favorite !! I been coming here for a while.. They recently added chicken tenders on there menu these are amazing !! Our service was amazing Andraya is one of the best And on top of everything !! I will keep coming here with my family and friends!! Don't forget there deep fried brownies first time having them they were soooo good! Thank you Andraya for giving me amazing service!"}
{"text":"The sauce is amazing. Now I love spice but baby spice is a good kick. Enjoyed the crowd.. Oh and the but one very one free beer!!! The service was excellent This place is a hidden treasure"}
{"text":"After much anticipation I finally made my way down to HnJ this last week with some girlfriends and we had a blast!  Pros: 1) Awesome service - our waitress was so friendly and even showed us how to eat the crawfish 2) Price- for all three of us only set us back $50 and we were stuffed! 3) Its cool to eat somewhere that was featured on the Food Network people!  Cons: 1) Did not fall madly in love with crawfish...but did like it. I guess we all preferred the shrimp....still it was fun. 2) Mild is still spicey! Be aware that the regular is spicy. I eat like a spice virgin soooooo kinda my own fault.  ( neither con is really anything wrong with them....just preferences..)  Overall it was a great experience and I would go back again! Maybe on my next Hot n Juicy Date :) LOL"}
{"text":"I've been to hot n juicy many times ,but this time it was a different. Due to my sweet waitress Dani, she helped and showed my how to crack a crawfish. She was so cute showing me too. Myself and my company really appreciate the great service. #vegaslocal"}
{"text":"Shrimp was great.. Crawfish were small.. Overall food was good.. Try the medium spice.. It is hot.."}
{"text":"I'm just not a fan. I came here once with my buddy and it was just plain messy. I do love to eat seafood and crawfish but clothes and hair smelled like fish after leaving that place. I'd rather go to my go to seafood place I've been going to for many years. Unfortunately, I will not be back!"}
{"text":"Landed in Vegas and went straight to Hot n Juicy Crawfish.. We ordered one lb shrimp with Hot n Juicy Special Mild and a shrimp basket, which had 10 shrimps but no fries. We ordered a side of Cajun fries since the boyfriend doesn't like sweet potato fries.   Overall, the food wasn't as spectacular a I hoped it would be. Maybe I'm a bit biased since we go to Boiling Crab in the Bay Area.   The sauce reminded me of a lemon butter sauce with a hint of curry. Even though we ordered mild, it was still spicy.   The Cajun fries were just regular potato fries and a bunch of Cajun powder dumped on top. Made the top fries spicy and the bottom fries bland.   The shrimp had too much batter and difficult to chew.   But the service and music are pretty good. Plus two stars for that."}
{"text":"Got to be responsible! Don't drink on an empty stomach, which is also an excuse for our first stop in Vegas to be Hot n Juicy! My friends and I came here just before close and the service was fantastic and the food was equally delicious!   The table ordered fries, fried shrimp basket and two pounds of crawfish. Unfortunately I didn't get to try any cause I was destroying my own pound of shrimp! It was so good, I understand why their name is \"Hot n Juicy\" because the food is just that! Prepared to be messy but satisfied.   Also can't forget the service, they staff was amazing and really made sure to take care of us."}
{"text":"delicious!!!   you walk in and that smell of garlic hits you and you automatically become hungry.   crawfish and blue crabs my fave, in Hot N Juicy sauce ( which is all of their sauces combined)   the shrimp can be mushy if they're of bad quality. I havent had good quality yet so i tend to stay away from that.   also order their fries and wings! super crispy and they stay that way throughout the meal.   nom nom nom! i am glad theres one in vegas so i dont have to go to california to get a boiling crab fix."}
{"text":"I had to update my review here. It was my older brothers birthday yesterday and I told him we should eat at angry crab. He preferred this place instead and I couldnt say no because it was his birthday. We ordered shrimp, black mussels, king crab legs, and crawfish all in hot and juicy sauce mild. We also ordered fries and soft shell crab. I was actually surprised because for the first time the sauce tasted great and everything was fresh. Out of all the times I visited here it did not taste right at all. The only downside towards this whole meal was the crawfish. It was overcooked. It was hard to get the meat off the shell. I wasnt surprised because their crawfish was always like that either over cooked or old. It would have been a 5 but Im a crawfish lover and it sucks that they could never get that right. So for all of you crawfish lovers I recommend you not to order that here. Everything else is great. Im glad I gave them a second chance. Will be back if my brother decides to eat here again."}
{"text":"Here from TX and always have to hit this spot. As usual, they don't disappoint. Service was great but we were the first customers of the day. Andrea and Selina were very attentive even as the restaurant filled up with hungry guests. Food was amazing. Even the frozen crawfish was on point. I may just come back later tonight to get something different. I normally eat here more than one time every time I'm in Vegas. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The food was excellent, spices blended perfectly, and came out a few minutes after ordering. Huge Shout out to Randy, he was friendly, fast and made my first time dining here all the more memorable. I'll definitely be coming back because of the food and great service"}
{"text":"Safe to say that it definitely lives up to its name! Crawfish were hot and juicy!!! We got their signature sauce spicy. It was definitely spicy in a good way not too overwhelming. Definitely recommend if you enjoy crawfish and crab legs. Only thing I would suggest is that the crab be cleaned a bit better."}
{"text":"really enjoyed going to this place  but they have a very limited bar menu, especially for the location at west gate where there are so many place with a larger drink menu.  Food is always good, i mean that why you right   for the seafood , lol."}
{"text":"Jaymee was a great waitress that made sure our cups were full and our meal was to our liking. Decided to step up from the dungeness crab and go with the king. Despite the thorns destroying my fingertips, the meat was well worth it. The Cajun fries were awesome as well as the oysters. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Wait time on a Saturday was said to be 20 min and it took about 30 min to be sat. Good thing we could order drinks from their bar. Atmosphere was a little muggy with the amount of customers inside the restaurant and the humidity outside. Food came out rather quickly and it was delicious. Worth the wait. 3 bags of crab legs, 3 bags of shrimp, 2 bowls of rice and a basket of fried shrimp and fries for $143."}
{"text":"First time here and was not impressed. I have been to Kickin' Crab in Southern California & also Vegas' own Boiling Crab, so the expectations were set pretty high for a restaurant of this nature. When we walked in all the tables were not bussed, and they sat there untouched until they did last call. My bf & I aren't messy eaters so we put all of our trash in one bag and a server came to our table and picked it up and moved it to another dirty table. The food came out all at different times, the first thing that came out was the extra seasoning we ordered with our crab & shrimp...and even that was cold. I love king crab and their king crab tasted fishy and very salty and was very small portioned compared to BC or KC. Same as the blue crab, one of which had an empty shell. The shrimp was too fishy for me, my bf said it was fresh but I didn't like the taste. The Cajun fries were the only thing we really liked out of the five things we ordered. Service was poor. Didn't live up to expectations and wasn't worth the money."}
{"text":"The  food was spectacular! My friends and I ate like 8 pounds of crawfish amongst us. The hot and juicy sauce was yummy but take it mild cause it's pretty spicy."}
{"text":"We waited 30 minutes to be seated when half the restaurant had empty tables. Host boy took a party of six before us and had us waiting some more. Staff needs more training.."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.   Since we've been to Angry Crab several times now, we wanted to try Hot N Juicy to compare! Right away, we loved the location and energy in Tempe. They played fun music and the floor to ceiling windows let in a lot of light and was ideal for people watching haha. The location is much smaller than Angry Crab and the closest parking was in a parking structure behind the movie theater. They don't validate parking so we had to pay $12 to park there, yikes. I guess its expected to pay high parking prices in the heart of downtown Tempe but you'd think there would be a discount for dining close by at least?   Anyway on to the food. We ordered the shrimp, snow crab, etouffee, oysters, and cajun fries. They let you order half pounds of shrimp (only for shrimp) here which is great but overall the prices are higher than the other place. Seafood tasted fresh though. The oysters were tiny so we were disappointed by that. The corn and potato we ordered with the shrimp was mushy though.The etouffee was yummy, kind of like a hearty seafood gumbo with peppers and crawfish, but for 8 bucks we got a container filled with 70% rice and maybe 30% etouffee. Not cool. They were nice enough to let us sample the etouffee before we ordered it though since we've never had it before.   I think what kind of ruined this visit for me was how runny the sauce was on the shrimp. We got the Hot N Juicy Special which was a mix of Louisiana Style, Juicy Cajun, Garlic Butter, and Lemon Pepper. Overall it tasted diluted to me... We ordered the same sauce on the snow crab but the sauce was a lot thicker. So we would peel our shrimp and dip it back into the sauce crab bag. Not sure if its this inconsistent all the time but I guess only a second visit will tell.   Oh FYI if you don't know what kind of crab to order, there are 4 options. King crab is more meaty and saltier, the most expensive, and a harder shell to penetrate. Snow crab (our favorite) is the second most expensive, with a thinner shell and sweeter meat. Dungeness crab is the whole crab, harder to break through and also has sweeter meat. They were out of blue crab so we didn't get to try it, but this was the cheapest option at about ten bucks a pound."}
{"text":"Our party of 12 was treated fabulously!! Food was great as always. Andrea rocks!!"}
{"text":"The food here is great if you're looking for some good seafood. We got the get your feet wet. Great combo! Our server was max. He's always attentive and polite."}
{"text":"I came in on a Saturday night and it was a full house. It was a 15-20 minute for small parties and bigger parties were 30-45 minutes longer. The parking lot is definitely small but I found people parking near the street they are near. I feel like this location is a faster place to dine in than the one near Pho Kim Long. People eat and go immediately. The food comes out quick as well and it's much more juicier than the other locations. La was our server and she was very welcoming and attentive with our table. She's great at refilling waters which is a big thing for me while eating anything spicy! The rest of the staff was also friendly. You never get the \"let me get your server\" when being asked for simple things like other restaurants."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if I get more excited about any other restaurant in Las Vegas, than I do for Hot N Juicy!  This place is amazing!  You can't be a prissy girl and eat at Hot N Juicy.  You are going to get your hands filthy in the most amazing sauces ever, you will not have silverware or even a plate, but rather a plastic table cloth- and you will smell as though you bathed in the garlicky goodness that is the Hot N Juicy sauce!    I live and breathe for the Hot N Juicy Special- SPICY Snow Crab Legs!! They are my true guilty pleasure!! I always get at least a pound or two and a side of Cajun Fries with extra seasoning, and wash it all down with their super inexpensive beers in a frosty mug.    I would, and could eat here at least once a week and never get sick of it.  They have a large variety of seafood (and chicken!) so there is something for everyone.."}
{"text":"OMG yummy!  This place had me licking my fingers, literally!  From seeing the reviews off yelp, we got off the plane and hailed a taxi straight to this place, which was only about 10 minutes from the airport.  The decor is low key and straight to the point...meaning they have no utensils and only a roll of paper towels on the table.  We ordered the fried catfish and chips and one pound of snowcrabs in their signature hot and juicy special.  The Fried catfish was so good!  The crust was perfect and the fish was so juicy on the inside.  The snowcrabs are to die for!  It comes in a plastic bag with the crab drenched in the sauce.  I swear for at least 5 minutes, you could not hear anyone talk because they were just eating.  We also ordered Fried Soft Shell Crab but they didn't have it =(    If you love cajun and you love seafood and shellfish, you must come here !"}
{"text":"First timer at HNJ. All around great experience. The servers were attentive, gave good suggestions, and the food was excellent. Our table tried the shrimp, crawfish, snow crab, oysters, and jumbalaya. All were delicious. We tried the HNJ with baby spice and the lemon pepper spice. The lemon pepper was my favorite. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went here with friends a few days ago after lunch rush hour. I was excited because 1) of all the reviews on Yelp 2) many friends have raved about this place. The atmosphere was nice and we were sat at a 8 person able even though there were only 5 of us, that's a plus because you'll need room when you eat this!   I ordered 2 lb craw fish , 2 lb shrimp with corn and sausage and potatoes. I enjoyed the \"hot n juicy\" flavor, which is a blend of all of their flavor and got the \"medium\" spice. It was yummy and the shrimps were insanely big!! Crawfish were frozen but they still were tasty. Ordered Cajun fries-- they were ok, have had better.  Service: it was ok, that's why I'm giving the place only 4 stars. Our waitress asked if we have ever been there and we said \"no,\" she didn't care to explain the menu or anything to us. She took our orders and after that she or anyone didn't come to even check on us the whole time. For first timers I feel like she should've tried to be more enthusiastic and at least asked us 1x how it was going with the food. Overall, I would come again."}
{"text":"Food was good, very flavorful but took a long time to get to my table. Service was average."}
{"text":"In the heart of downtown Tempe is where my boyfriend and I found this gem. I was super skeptical, cause how do you get good seafood in the desert? They made it happen though!   I ordered a pound of crab legs and 1 pound of crawfish with potatoes and sausage. Both were seasoned in the Hot and Juicy season with spicy seasoning. It was delicious! Although they were out of fresh crawfish (I had the frozen), I was still impressed.   Server was great, order time was decent for a Friday night. I will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Crawfish and oysters, oh my!    The oysters are served on ice and come with all the fix-ins.  Want some hot sauce?  It's there.  Want some horseradish?  It's there.  Want some cocktail sauce (I think that is what it is, lol)?  It's there.    Wanna talk crawfish?  No?  Well, I do!  The crawfish come by the pound (which is how they should, by the way)... and they come in a bag-o-sauce.  Perfect for making sure all them there crawfish are evenly covered in the most amazingly delicious sauce you could ever want.  I get mine with the Hot N Juicy spice and \"medium\" spice level (although sometimes I venture to \"spicy\" when I feel like punishing myself a bit).  No matter which way you go, the crawfish are always well cooked and delicious.  The place is usually crazy busy and there is almost always a wait... and while I am a huge fan of this place, I'm guessing the wait has more to do with the prime location of this H-N-J on Spring Mountain Rd.  The waitstaff isn't always the most attentive and I have ran out of water a handful of times during my multiple visits... but I always just reach over and drink the person's water from the table next to mine.  A must-have while in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Don't Bother, the craw fish are tiny and hardly worth the work trying to get a smaller than thumbnail"}
{"text":"Kudos to hot n juicy!!! So here's the story. Me and my hubb eats here like every single week. So we ate here again last weekend and thru the week I've been looking for my watch and my pandora bracelet (girls y'know how important our pandora bracelets) lol then suddenly I just remember I removed my watch and bracelet while eating here lolol so I called them and asked if they happen to see my bracelet and watch (remember its almost a week) and yes they have it!!! Thank God. They kept and sealed it in a ziplock. Thank you guys!!! Thank you and god bless your restau. More happy customers to come :)"}
{"text":"I try and always make a stop here when we visit Vegas. I order the Crawfish, shrimp, & clams, King Crab legs, corn of the cobb (MILD) that's all I can handle.  The taste of their sauces on everything are delicious. The girls/Staff there have always been very friendly to us. Prices are fair for what you're getting.  There are a lot of places like this in my area, but none have that delicious flavor like they do.  My only Con: is parking, you have to be there early or your parking somewhere down the street."}
{"text":"Who doesn't like butter?!?! Right? This place is absolutely amazing! I've been here numerous times and I always leave feeling completely endulged and the satisfaction of doing work!   You have to be willing to work for every bite, but boy oh boy is every bite worth it. I usually get the snow crab or the shrimp with the lemon seasoning.   I always have to get my area situated and ready before the beautiful sight of bags full of butter and critters! =] It is messy so don't plan on wearing your cute outfit for the night! Although you do get a classy bib to wear.  Also, be aware that you could possibly smell like butter for awhile.  But despite the lingering smell, this is a MUST HAVE MUST GO!  The service is great and the food is even better!"}
{"text":"We waited over 30 minutes to get a table at 9 pm, but it was worth it.  Honestly can say that this was the best meal during our trip."}
{"text":"I like this location because it is right on the strip and they are open till late (midnight). The workers are pretty friendly and the food is always delicious. The crab is always cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"Very tasty seafood, which was served in a plastic bag all mixed together, that you dump on the table and just dig into. Wait staff was attentive, we were greeted by the hostess and sat right away, all in all a pretty good experience."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place. Crawfish and crab was delicious. I also really enjoyed the corn fritters. Will most likely come back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"OMG! This place is so fire!   I've never been here until today. I wanted some hot seafood but didn't want to hit up red lobster. I came in and was greeted by the waitress who let us sit wherever we wanted. I ordered the mild spice level \"Drool\" which was $47.99. It came with 1 pound of crawfish, 1 pound of shrimp, half a pound of snow crab legs, 2 corns, 2 potatoes, and cajun calamari. I ordered the brownies for desert. My choice of drink was the sweet tea. They bring me a bib, gloves, and utensils to eat with. This was a first for me and after I was done they just wrap everything up on the plastic table cloth over the table. This place was great and I enjoyed myself a lot. Will definitely return!!! I recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"Service and food was amazing, everything from crab to shrimp in a bag with corn, sausage and potatoes, and on the day I went in they even had a nice cold Modelo beer and a chilled glass served from my beautiful waitress Valentina. Valentina was on point and a great waitress make sure the customer service was beyond my expectations, I will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Unbelievably messy,hot,flavorful......AMAZING!!!!! 11 outa 10 plus it's located in Sin City need I say more...... I didn't think so."}
{"text":"Went here with the wife and a few friends.  There was no wait so that was definitely a plus seeing the last time we tried to visit this place the wait was over 2 hours.  Anyway, I ordered the shrimp with sausage and some rolls.  Wifey ordered shrimp and fries and my buddy ordered shrimp and sine catfish. I can't remember the other orders.   First,  let's talk about the drinks.....if you want a few cocktails definitely visit sine of the other bars at Westgate.  The beer was ok, but the Margarita and lemon drop were a total waste.....and I mean they weren't even half finished when we left and we usually don't leave liquor. I didn't try the catfish,  but my buddy ate only one piece and threw the rest out, so I definitely didn't want to try it.  The shrimp was good,  but plucking the heads off and trying to get the vains out was getting tiresome.  Although we did have a good time and the staff were very friendly, we won't be going back.  Also,  the sausage was tasty."}
{"text":"long line,  parking was a bit challenging. foods was ok.  the sauce was not spicy,  but sweet. overcooked shrimps...i guess i came on the wrong day that time. crawfish was over done n small so its really hard to peel them."}
{"text":"My husband and I come here a lot. We love the food. The hot and juicy shrimp is our favorite. Food, I have no complaints ever. We keep coming back for the food.  We come about once a month and the service hasn't seemed to improve. First of all, there is no check in. Yes there's a check in booth, but no one is ever running it. When there's over 5 groups you just got to keep in mind who is next because they aren't keeping track. Second, it takes them a long time to bring your refill. Sometimes forget all together. They also take very long to bring your check.   Bathroom is always clean so that's a plus. Food is awesome though,  that's what keeps us coming back"}
{"text":"Yummy and delicious seafood. You'll get your hands and possibly your clothes dirty. It's really fun to go here with a bunch of friends. It is about the same as boiling crab."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!!!  Every time I am in Vegas, I make at least one trip here.  They offer a variety of seafood options.  We always start off with a round of oysters, fried calamari, and their cajun fries.  Then we are off to pounds and pounds of crawfish, king crab legs, dungeness crabs and shrimps.  Our prefer seasoning is the Hot N Juicy special with the spicy level of spice.  Boy is it spicy, but sure hits the spot.  The seafood is always fresh here and the fried food stays crispy and is non-greasy.  You really cannot go wrong with this place if you are an avid seafood lover."}
{"text":"Came here Sunday night at 8. Was informed that there was a 45 minute wait and that they do not book reservations. You must be there to keep yourself in line which I think is annoying because now I have to wait. So to kill time, my family and I walked around Westgate until they texted us saying our table was ready. It was super busy but our server was attentive and friendly, making sure to check up on us. My little sister spilled soda and about 3 ladies came over to help clean, so I applaud them for that. We ordered a lot of crawfish, shrimp, Po Boys (chicken nuggets, wings, and chicken tenders one for the kids), fries, and a dozen oysters. Many of the crawfish were soft shell but I have to say the sauce/juice was good. Oysters are good as well, I think if they washed it a bit more then I would've enjoyed them more. Overall, I like it here."}
{"text":"This is the worst place to go.. Crawfish was so small and dry... Crab legs had no taste... It took them forever to make food as well. Better go seafood supermarket and buy some live crabs and boil them."}
{"text":"Ate here after the Seahawks/Cardinals game.   The Good Wait staff was attentive and checked on us multiple times  Raw Oyster appetizers were very fresh and good size.   The Bad Fried shrimp - stay away. Huge lumps of fried dough. You had to peel away most of the cornmeal dough just to get to the shrimp.   Steamed Snow crab legs. We had the buttery garlic sauce which was nice but we ordered two pounds and only got two clusters. Very anemic portion for $40.   Won't be coming back"}
{"text":"***VERY DISAPPOINTING*** As a Louisiana native, I was excited about getting some decent seafood. This is not it, and is hellishly overpriced to boot. We had black mussels that had been obviously frozen and reheated to the point of being mealy. Ugh. The crab legs were much the same, though crab legs are more forgiving. Skip this ripoff and go to a casino seafood buffet."}
{"text":"Fearful of the crowds of people who flock here due to their popularity, hubby and I booked it here on Friday evening around 5:50pm.  I'm so glad we did!  By the time we left, there were tons of people waiting.  Service was good, though not always available.  When we wanted to add a pound of shrimp, I had to send hubby up to the cash register to place the order.  Normally, when we go out with friends to other crawfish places, we get (insert house spice here)-Medium.  Because this was hubby's choice/birthday weekend, I let him order mild.  As it turns out, it was delicious!  The sauce was buttery, not greasy and very tasty without the flames on your tongue.  We did notice that the seafood was about $1+ more per pound than out here in California but that's understandable given that Las Vegas is kind of far away from the o-chin (Ralphie May fans will get that lol).  We enjoyed our meal and have promised to bring our friends back when we return to Las Vegas in about 3 weeks.  All aboard!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place,I'm a shrimp lover.Their sauce is sooo good!I like to get the hot and juicy special,extra spicy.And if you're feeling a bit adventurous and like lemon pepper flavor,ask for lemons and black pepper salt.Squeeze a couple lemons into the sauce cup with the salt and pepper mixture.I would try the mussels also.They were really good but it does take longer to make and come out.Fun place to get your hands dirty and have some good,fresh seafood."}
{"text":"?????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"My extra large party waited an extra long time but it was so worth the wait!  We had just wrapped up a long day of meetings and venue tours and Hot N' Juicy was calling our names.  The hosts were more than accommodating of our large party of over 30 people and they were very friendly once we were finally all seated.  The hosts appeared calm and collected despite serving so many people and I was impressed with their professionalism!   We quickly ordered our food and waited in anticipation for everything to arrive to the table.  We were pleasantly surprised with how quickly everything was brought out!  All the seafood arrived steaming hot and there were surprisingly no errors in any of the orders.  I got the mild Cajun seasoning and that proved to be a bit too spicy for my sensitive palate.  I powered through my tears because it was still so tasty; baby spice next time for sure.  The only disappointment was the Cajun fries! They were so lightly seasoned that it wasn't worth paying extra for the flavor!   Despite the bland fries, we had a wonderful time here and all raved about the fun meal to our friends that could not make it in time.  I'll definitely be back for the baby spice."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I love seafood! I would give up beef, pork, chicken..haha, but I could never give up seafood. Came to this place for dinner & ordered hot & juicy shrimps. It was spicy!!!! The lemon pepper clams were good as I like a bit of sour flavor. Two cajun crabs were yummy! One pound of each. Can tell I love seafood?! Lol  If you come here, make sure you come early. Parking is a pain. The place is in China Town on Spring Mt. Road (across from Tofu Hut) so, it is usually crowded. Parking somewhere down other restaurants is fine & then walk down to this place. This place is busy inside as well. So, plan accordingly!"}
{"text":"I called to place a to go order and everything went as smoothly as possible. They answered the phone very promptly which I loved because the planet Hollywood location doesn't. You have to call that one a few times to get an answer. The person who took my phone order was great, she made sure she had my order correct by repeating everything to me after we finished, I had a very large order so I was glad she took her time and made sure it was right. When I got there I walked right up and let them know I was there to pick up an order. Everyone was very friendly as they pulled up my ticket so I could pay. My food was already ready when I got there which was great and they made sure I had whatever condiments I needed and also wet naps. The food was amazing as always! I love this location because even though it gets busy everything still is done in a timely matter and the wait is never too long when I actually go and sit down and eat. Great job guys!"}
{"text":"********************* 1256 **********************     I was anxious to check this place out. The moment we landed to Vegas, my best friend I came here for an afternoon snack. The place was nice, clean and good looking waitresses. Our waitress was very nice and attentive to us.     The place was 2/3 empty on a Wednesday afternoon during CES 2015..   - Snow Crab Legs - Hot N Juicy Special. medium spicy. The bag came out looking good, until I tasted to sauce, it was so salty that I almost spitted out.   - Crawfish  - Hot N Juicy Special. medium spicy. The waitress told me it was fresh, it wasn't. It was frozen, and uneven in size. A few of them was smelly and mushy. The sauce was unbearable salty.     I looked around and I wonder was it just my best friend and I, our taste buds could be that way off. How can anyone eat food this salty. We left with our mouths swollen. I didn't touch the crawfish.... We told the waitress, she said no one was complained and they have been popular in Vegas for years. Although she didn't offer us the credit for the food we didn't eat either.     My best friend and I used to own Coco's Crawfish in San Francisco a few years back 2008-2011. We know the business well. This was before the crawfish got all trendy in San Jose and the OC.     I don't know how it can be this off. I would never come back here again. It got me sick later in the day. It ruins my palate for the rest of the day. Sad!      P.S. They also sell their waitress calendar, it's almost like Hooters, except they didn't show much skin."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!, Enrique was an incredible server which was very attentive and extremely knowledgeable in his products. I live by another crawfish up and I drove past it to come to this location!"}
{"text":"Loved it!!!  Was going to get my own and the server expertly recommended my mom and I share and thank heavens she did!!! It was so much delicious food!!!!"}
{"text":"I'd give 3.5 stars if I could.  Lots of comments already on Hot 'n Juicy so I'll just make some observations and recommendations for newbies:  - You might want to avoid the crawfish. Not enough meat to justify the price. Ordered once and never again. - Why they don't serve a nice bread to sop up the intensely flavorful sauce is beyond my comprehension. - Shrimp are jumbo sized and a good option for first timers. - Wish they would serve a better quality rice as a side dish. - Prices are a bit steep, in particular for the catfish basket and calamari. Doesn't feel like a good value for such simple deep fried items.   Overall an enjoyable messy experience."}
{"text":"WAS our favorite. Til thursday 5/24.  I and my husband went here around 7pm because the one in Chinatown had an hour wait. We haven't been to this one so we gave it a try. As usual, food was great. We had the Get Your Feet Wet plus a side of Sweet Potato and Cajun fries. It was great until I chew on one of the crawfish and it tasted like sand and dirty water. Since I was so hungry I didn't mind at first. A few more things left in our food, I and my husband started having a tummy ache. We thought that we were just over eating honestly. When we got home, he started having diarrhea and I was throwing up. We gave it a couple minutes to see if we just really over ate but the following day, I threw up again and I also had the diarrhea. I and my husband were both very nauseous for 3 straight days.  We're giving you 2 stars for great service while we were dining. But not giving you that 3 as you need to focus more on making sure that you clean the food thoroughly before you actually cook it so no other customers get food poisoned like us. Will not eat here anymore. :("}
{"text":"I've been to many Boiling Crabs across CA so I was anticipating a lot from Hot N Juicy. I ordered: 1/2 lb shrimp with 1/2 dozen sausage, corn, cajun fries, and I tried some of my friends' oysters and crawfish. Got Mild with Hot N Juicy seasoning.   Firstly, prices were a little steeper than BC, maybe $1-2 higher. Dived into the food and after a few bites, my mouth was ON FIRE. Seriously. I got Mild, the lowest spice setting and I had to stop eating a few times because my mouth was suffering. I got the sweats, Corona & water didn't help, and my stomach even hurt a bit. You might call me weak and maybe I am, but I order a Mild at BC and I have no problem finishing a Whole Shabang there.   It was so spicy that I could barely taste the seasoning. The corn was mushy/soggy. The sausages were good, but still had the same level of insane heat. Oysters were bigger than I'd like, I prefer mine small and sweet.   Overall, the most memorable part of my meal were the sausages and the saltine/oyster/horseradish/cocktail sauce combo. Boiling Crab over Hot N Juicy any day."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I stopped by this place last week, mainly because we saw the restaurant featured on Man vs. Food and because of the great reviews it gets on Yelp. Sadly, I was let down by Adam Richman and all of my fellow Yelpers.  Shortly after we were seated, the waitress warned us that Hot N Juicy's spice levels were much higher than your \"typical restaurant\" and advised us to go for a lower spicy level when we ordered our shrimp. Taking her advice, we went with a milder sauce. We noticed a lot of things wrong when we got our shrimp:  - There was absolutely no \"juice\" in the bag. We have been to similar restaurants where the shrimp/crawdads are served in the \"juice\" to give added flavor. Considering that this restaurant is called \"Hot N Juicy\", we were both expecting JUICY.  - The shrimp had absolutely no flavor to them. It literally tasted like they boiled a bag of shrimp in water and served it to us. Again, considering that this restaurant is called \"Hot N Juicy\", we were both expecting HOT.  We asked for a hotter sauce on the side to dip our shrimp in since we were let down by the sauce we ordered. The waitress was kind enough to come back with a small container of their \"Hot N Juicy\" sauce. This was also very subpar - it tasted like a blend of marinara sauce with a hint of Tabasco. Again, the sauce was not spicy at all. I think its important to note that my girlfriend and I aren't huge fans of spicy food. When we do order wings or shrimp, we tend to go for a medium level of spiciness due to our own sensitivities with spicy food. That being said, nothing in this restaurant (that we tried) is even remotely spicy.  We also ordered a side of calamari. These were ok, but considering the price for the order it was not worth it.   The only saving grace for this restaurant is the ambiance and decor. The restaurant itself has a cool modern look, is very well air conditioned (which is a big thing for me) and plays good music. I would come here to buy a beer but would stay the hell away from the food."}
{"text":"One of the most horrific waste of plastic products ever! One time use plastic table cloths...bibs...stack of plastic gloves...styrofoam water cups and plastic beer cups...straws and plastic spoons...even the meals were served in plastic bags! service was horrible. I was sick of the waste and lost my appetite. Wake up people..."}
{"text":"Hot N Juicy, my forever Vegas go to for southern style seafood. Amazing food and even better service. My god Eric was a blessing from above. Boy, if you want service he's the man to speak to!  Came in late during the peak of lunch service and was still able to get seated promptly. Food was nothing short of amazing, I practically ordered everything on the menu for a group of 6 and everything came out in quick fashion.  Only problem was a rude table next to us that seemed to complain about everything. There was nothing wrong, just their attitude. I commend the staff on their ability to handle the stress in such situations. But I certainly won't let that diminish this review.  Great job guys! 7/5 would definitely recommend to others and will certainly be coming back."}
{"text":"So I just flew into Vegas tonight and pretty much headed straight here after checking into my hotel. What can I say, I was fiending. While I was a little skeptical reading some of the reviews from loyal Boiling Crab fans (because honestly, who doesn't love BC), I decided to give it a shot. So, let me reiterate that I have been to both Boiling Crab and Hot n Juicy, and each has their pros and cons. I personally think they stack up pretty well (and I have reviewed both).  Pros for Hot n Juicy:  1. Wait time was less than 10 minutes for a table for 2. It was a \"slow\" night for them (Monday) around 8ish but there was enough space to sit while waiting. While we were waiting, C and I searched their wall of Polaroids for Adam Richman's...of course, he had his own frame.  2. Wait staff was friendly. Our server Amanda was excellent. She checked in with us frequently and let us know that the kitchen was closing and asked if we wanted any more food before then. After it was kind of cooled down a little (we were one of the last to leave) she came over and talked to us and we bonded over our dogs. I think that their wait staff is WAY nicer than BC's. They say hi as soon as you walk in the door...and they smile. Who'd have thought.  3. Price is pretty good. After reading previous reviews, we decided to skip the crawfish, and we got 2 pounds of shrimp (with their version of BC's \"whole shabang\" sauce) with sausage (which are bigger), sweet potato fries, and 2 beers a piece and the total was less than $45. I saw complaints about the shrimp being overcooked, but ours was done perfectly.  4. They have a full bar.   Cons for Hot N Juicy:  1. Their parking lot is tiny...fits maybe 20 cars. We had to park in the lot across the side street and walk over.  2. Restaurant is a lot smaller than BC. If you go on a super busy night, it might take you a bit longer to get seated. That's the main reason that we went tonight instead of on a Saturday.  3. You walk out of there smelling like crap. But...you would at BC too. So I guess that's not much of a con.  In terms of the food...the level was about the same, although I will say this (and I hope it makes sense): while H&J was a little bit spicier, BC had more flavor to it. My friend and I both liked the sweet potato fries here better than at BC. The size of the sausage (har, har, har) was bigger at H&J. Beer prices were the same, which is a huge plus. You really can't beat $3 for a Corona. Both places have TVs, which at the time were playing the Lakers game.  If I was in town again, I would probably end up going back. It's no BC, but it fills the void.  I'd give it 3 3/4 stars, but I round up because I'm nice."}
{"text":"Food is delicious and service was fast and friendly. Prices were reasonable but parking was tight. There was no long wait so I recommend you come early between wpm and 6 pm. Myka was my amazing server please request her if you are looking for positive energy."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a while. Took a friend here for dinner. I remember them serving with great flavors in their shrimps and crawfish's in the past. This time though, the shrimps seems to be a little undercooked."}
{"text":"I personally did not like their \"signature\" sauce which is their hot n juicy, ummm yuck, it was alright if you have nothing to compare it to but I did and seriously if you're craving this style of food, go to Angry Crab Shack in mesa and get the trifecta sauce, now THAT'S amazing! On top of the sauce being just alright, I asked for mild and it was way too spicy to be considered mild, like nose leaking, mouth on fire, had to wipe off the sauce from crab legs spicy, and I grew up in Asia eating spicy foods so I'm not a whimp. What a waste of 2 lbs of crab legs and $40. Ugh needless to say I'll never get food from here again, I'm willing to make the extra miles to go to mesa to get the real deal!"}
{"text":"Smelly and gross.  Cheap seafood and powdered seasonings served in plastic bags.  Friggin disgusting.  Really.  Salty!!!!  Ugh.  It made me sick.  Crappy shellfish boiled with salty water.  Disgusting.  The garlic was on my fingers and coming out of my pours for a week.  One of the worst restaurants ever."}
{"text":"I honestly don't get why people go crazy for this food.  Cheap, overcooked, smelly seafood served in a plastic bag?  It's really disgusting.  I was sweating garlic out of my pores for a week.  You have to peel the crawdads and shrimp, which is fine, more flavor up in there that way, but it's so overcooked the meat turns to mush and your fingers will stink of farm-raised crawfish from god-knows-what southeast asian cesspool and garlic for days.  Bleccch.  Don't know why I went back."}
{"text":"I like this place with the friendly stuff and the hot n juicy food! (Heh..) I never had a problem here or a complain. Though its a bit small place don't let that stop you from coming here and enjoying the \"Hot n Juicy\" food!!"}
{"text":"Great service and seafood. Love the King crab legs.  Hot and juicy sauce has the right amount of heat."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!!! The service and the food was amazing as usual. Thank you so much Dani all the recommendations ."}
{"text":"The last few times I've been here the crab is so salty it's inedible! All 5 in my party agreed. I asked the waitress Shaunna about it, and she dismissed me by saying \"everything is the same as usual.\" It's too bad. I will not be coming back here."}
{"text":"After passing by this place half a dozen times and laughing at the name, I saw it recommended in Fodor's, and quickly Yelped it to see that  it was indeed a highly appreciated, just two dollar signs, seafood spot.  Couldn't wait to go, and it was dee-licious!    I had a pound of snow crab legs in their hot and juicy sauce.  Normally I would get the crawfish, but they are out of season right now, so they just had frozen available.  Thankfully our server had given us a heads up that their spicy was a notch or two above most other places; I had \"mild\" and my lips were burning with the first bite.  Not that I let a little thing like that slow me down.  You have to order corn and red bliss potatoes by the piece, so I had one of each, and they had also absorbed the awesome hot spicy flavor from the sauce.  The weak link in this restaurant are the servers.  Supposedly every server is yours, not just one.  But we found that meant asking several people for the same item before we actually got it.  Happened twice to us with requests for more ketchup and more water, and we heard the table next to us say the same thing.  Also, our original server placed our order incorrectly (which she acknowledged immediately) so then one member of our party had to wait 10+ minutes for her food to come out while the rest of us were eating.  And since we didn't have our \"own\" waitress, nobody gave us updates, nobody let a manager know, and we kept having to flag servers down to find out what was happening.  It definitely turned a five star rating into a four star rating."}
{"text":"I first tried this place on Christmas Eve and let me tell you, their food was delicious! We had shrimp, and muscles with their special sauce and everything was just fresh and delicious. Their service was also good. We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"This place was Awesome! Everything was delicious. You have to try the Hot n Juicy/ Medium on any by the lb item and the fried catfish."}
{"text":"Been to this place a few times now since check in.  Whenever I am in the mood for seafood I think of here.  I like the very simple menu and choices of sauce you can eat with.  Of course not their fault but I wish some of the crab wasn't seasonal.  The location is in the heart of mill and can be crowded in that area but it's great that one is pretty close by."}
{"text":"First I would like to start off by saying the other location is not the same.  We come here every time we visit HNJ and I tried giving the 2nd location in chinatown a 2nd chance the flavors to me taste different and I believe service is better at the original location.. But then again I was wrong.  We were told there was no wait to go to the other location and it's exactly the same I said no because I like this original place better.  To me the flavors are different.   I hyped about HNJ to all my girls for months before our bachelorette party weekend and when we got there the girls were impressed and loved the HNJ sauce!  But our complaint is our server.  She said she could split our tab 3 ways so we grouped into 3 groups.  We had 10 girls. When we got our tab all our bills were wrong some orders were scattered in different groups which isn't a big deal because that can always be fixed.. Then we found out one of the girls had ordered 2lbs of mild HNJ crawfish but only received 1lb she just said forget it. There was a moment where a different server tried to drop off a 1lb of HNJ medium and no one knew who it belonged too we sent it back because no one ordered it well our server told us she brought it back and gave it to is anyways and someone ate it. We told her no one ate it and we would have noticed a extra bag of crawfish sitting around the table!  She couldnt even tell us who she gave it to.  The girls could barely manage what they ordered and I was the only person that ordered a extra lb after my order! The server Helaine said there is a extra order I brought it back out and put it on the table someone ate it and I didn't eat it so I'm not paying for it since I didn't eat it because this is coming out of my pocket! We told her no one got it we returned it and she insisted that she sent it back out! I said u should check ur cameras and roll the tape and see where that extra bag went!  She already got her 18% automatic gratuity from our large group of 10 and she was complaining about $9.99 coming out of her pocket that was our automatic tip that went to her poor rude service!  HNJ should re-evaluate there servers!  We didn't want to cause a scene since there was so many of us.  We figured if she really wanted that $9.99 she can have it!  We definitely did not return!  I been coming here for years and always rave about this place to my friends everywhere but beware the service is a hit or miss!  I admit the seafood is great but service is down right awful!  This happened memorial day weekend"}
{"text":"We are hot  n juicy fans since I first seen them air on Man vs Food.  We always go to Hot N Juicy the first day when we land and usually have crawfish everyday we are there during our trip.  We come a few times a year from the midwest.  We were very disappointed with the new location.  Poor service the waitress ordered us double of everything, she rarely came by, we had to ask for everything from other servers which didn't seem so friendly, and they over charged us for duplicate orders the waitress messed up on.  When we walked up to pay for bill and have the mistakes adjusted the waitress was rude!  Next the hot n juicy sauce tastes different more watered down and all canjun.  I found more dead crawfish in my two lb bag then fresh ones and the food was so disappointing that we didn't even finish our food.  We usually start with 2lbs and end with at least 4-5lbs each.  The new ratings are right food doesn't seem as fresh, poor service, and the flavors are different.  We need more consistency.  I didn't want to go to the new place because you take that chance it's not the same different cooks and I lost my appetite for hot n juicy for this 4day vacay.  Maybe before we go home we will try it one more time at the original location and get the real taste of the hot n juicy sauce with more thick tangy juicy tastes and not watered down Cajun like any other crawfish joint."}
{"text":"***Reminder not to eat 1 pound of mild garlic shrimp before going to Club Jet*** LOL"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I had never been here but a friend, who has eaten here on several previous occasions, suggested a group of us meet here.  What a great idea!!!  The setting is plain. Be forewarned, your food is delivered in a plastic bag and there is a roll of paper towels on every table (you're gonna need it!)!  We each ordered 2 lbs of shrimp in garlic butter with mild spice. I am embarrassed/proud that I had no problem eating the 2 lbs of shrimp plus corn and a potato.  Again, another heads up, the shrimp have shells, including heads, intact so it is peel and eat. The shrimp were firm, meaty and had the proper texture for cooked shrimp. The garlic butter was just right, also, with good sized chunks of fresh garlic. I will definitely return to this no frills but tasty restaurant!"}
{"text":"I have wanted to dine at H&J for so long, but the other locations are so dang far from me that it just hasn't worked out.  I was SO SO SO excited to see the new location open in Henderson that I set up a UYE.  The restaurant is in a great location, just off the 215 on Eastern.  There is plenty of parking, and although the restaurant isn't huge, they had no problem accommodating our party of 10.  This is a messy, messy place.  Be prepared to be up to your elbows in spicy, juicy sauce!  Don't be intimidated, just dive right in.  Here's the deets:  1.  Pick your \"meat.\"  They sell everything by the pound, according to current market price (posted throughout the restaurant). They have lobster, king crab legs, snow crab legs, mussels, clams, shrimp, and off course crawfish.  2. Pick your spice level.  The waitress said that their sauces tend to be on the spicy side and they recommend going 1 level down to ensure you are comfortable.  If it's not hot enough, they can bring you extra sauce on the side.    3.  Pick your sauce.  They have cajun, garlic butter, and some others, including their special H&J sauce, which is apparently a mix of all of the other sauces.  You can also add sides - the cajun fries were really good.  They also have corn and potatoes that will be added to your bag.  Yes, bag.  Your food will come out in a large plastic bag!  They will also provide gloves if you don't want to get dirty, but where's the fun in that?!  There is a sink in the hallway leading to the bathroom where you can wash up when you are done - what a life saver!  The decor is nice and modern.  There is plenty of seating, with tables in the middle and large booths around the outside.  There was also a bar, but it looked seriously out of place and didn't look like there was anything going on behind it.  Couple of things to note:  They add auto gratuity to large parties.  They will also only split checks 3 ways.  Our server was very friendly and offered to split them up for all of us, which actually created mass confusion and took a long time.  I felt bad for her!  Everyone was super friendly.  If you've been hesitating to try this place out - DON'T.  It's something different that you should definitely try if you love seafood.  Although, they also had chicken nuggets on the menu if you don't!"}
{"text":"Not sure why people love this place so much! It's good, but I know I don't particularly don't enjoy eating my food out of a plastic baggie!   Yes it's hot & juicy for sure, and yes it makes sense to wear the traditional crab eating bib and to use the gloves, but I damn, I don't know, I would have preferred a bowl, or a plate.   And definitely use the gloves, but your hands will still smell for a day or so!  The grab & mussels were good. The corn fritters were amazing!"}
{"text":"I was never really a seafood person but my friends have been telling to go try it out, so I did. Do not regret one bit! Our server's name was Dianne, she was wonderful. Made us feel super welcomed with her bright smile. The food was amazing!! Can't get enough of the sauce XD  My overall experience was wonder!"}
{"text":"The food is good but the service is horrible. They are out of everything right when they open, the wait staff doesn't know the menu, and the server asked me how to make a Bloody Mary even though it's a drink on the menu. They need a management change immediately or it will fail like the other restaurants at the Westgate."}
{"text":"It was our first time there and the experience was not good. Here we sit at Baskin Robbins writing this review because Hot N Juicy was out of the ONE dessert that they offer. The food was mediocre. Overcooked shrimp and crawfish. We ordered the lowest spice and once we got the food it was NOT the lowest spice. It was my boyfriends birthday and we told them twice thinking they would do something a little special but didn't even acknowledge it. They were also out of almost every item we tried to order except for the main meal. We went for a good time and a good meal and were very disappointed. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Had dinner here yesterday it was crazy busy and we had to wait about 45 minutes.  It turned out to be totally worth the wait!  We had a party of 4 and we tried most of boiled options (except for lobster since they were out).  Our waitress Valerie was incredibly helpful all of her recommendations were spot on.  We had crawfish with garlic butter, shrimp with lemon pepper,  mussels with garlic butter, clams with lemon pepper, dungenous crab with garlic butter, snow crab with hot and juicy spice, oysters, corn and corn fritters.  Our favorites were the shrimp (we had it twice) and the snow crab.  We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"After seeing a special with Hot N Juicy Crawfish Las Vegas on the Food Network, I had to give this place a try when we were in town last week.  The hubby loves seafood and I'm not much of a fan but this place definitely made me think differently.  We had lunch here since it was less busy than dinner time and were so glad we had a chance to try out the food.  Everything is pretty much steamed and then tossed in thick clear plastic bags to absorb whatever sauces you choose.  They also give you gloves and bibs because it does get messy, but that is where everything tastes so much better.  We ordered a dozen oysters on the half shell, 2 lbs of Dungeness crab, 2 lbs of frozen  crawdads (they didn't have any fresh ones flown in that day), and 1 lb of shrimp.  We had them all tossed in the famous Hot n Juicy sauce (which is a combination of all their flavors they have) with a spice level of Spicy.  Man, it had major kick and made all the seafood taste so much better.  The hubby was surprised to see me for the very first time actually sucking on all the sauce juices from the seafood, normally I just peel away and eat the meat.  It is definitely two things that make this place well known:  the freshness and simplicity of their seafood choices, and the killer sauces everything is tossed in.  Staff were all very friendly (especially our waitress Polina) , always stopping in to make sure everything was okay.  Definitely recommend this place if you are a seafood fan.  We will return next time we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"THE BEST!!!! enough said! everything about this place is awesome the price, the selection of seafood, and the omg taste of it all gets u drooling just thinking about it haha. love this place recommend it to anyone thats a seafood lover and loves spices.   quick tip expect a lil long wait cause theres probably alot of ppl dying to get into this place just like you will be."}
{"text":"Really disappointed.... the service was really slow, took forever to get our drinks and server spent most of the time standing in the corner. She seemed annoyed just having to get us water... Didn't get everything we ordered and some of what we did get was wrong. Overall, the food was ok but we definitely won't be going back."}
{"text":"When I first walked into this place I noticed everyone wearing a bib and I thought to myself I refuse to look like an idiot and wear a bib. 10 minutes later when the crab came out, I looked like an idiot. I like this place as a nice change of pace in Las Vegas, it's different and when the food is dumped right in front of you, you have to bypass your usual table manners and just ripping into the food with your hands hoping you don't get juice in someone's eye from all the cracking. I never knew a roll of paper towels could vanish that fast. I didn't get to try much just the crawfish and the crab, marinated with lemon pepper and garlic butter respectively. The crab was good, what's not to like about snow crab legs? I just wish crab itself was cheaper because I'm hungry and 20 legs deep just makes me want more. The crawfish on the other hand, I can do without. Love the juices, but after about 30 crawfish I felt like all I had was a bowl of soup. Good place, medium layout, decently clean bathrooms (B-) and the more people the better."}
{"text":"You're gonna have to get your hand dirty on this one!  I could eat the shrimp here all day.  Go with the Hot N' Juicy Sauce for a veritable taste explosion!  Be sure to supplement whichever shellfish you get with corn or potatoes they are great as well!  Your food will come steamed in the sauce in a piping hot plastic bag.  Gloves and bibs are around for those who need them, but that ruins the fun.  We have taken to saving the sauce and bring it home to put over rice the next day...it gets even spicier but is delicious!  This is a \"must go\" any time your in Sin City!"}
{"text":"So this is my 2nd time here at hot n juicy mills...and once at westgate. I have to say I love it. Very affordable, clean , and the staff is very friendly. It kinda sucked our server had to relocate her section, which wasn't too bad cause it seem like everyone was helping out. Only suggestion I would have is HNJ need to make sure they are leaving at least 1 bucket to discard waste from shell fishy the table. We had to ask for that and we only received one bucket being a table of 6 . I also went to the one out in west phoenix they had amazing service as well. If I had to choose between the two I'll drive to west phoenix location in westgate.   My recommendation to customers get the drool...you'll enjoy it I would say that feed 2. Sauce u want is HNJ side of butter and a beer. Wink wink. The snow crab us phenomenon and the calamari is to die for. Why your at it try the black mussels they hold the HNJ flavors just as well as the potatoes and corn. YOU'LL LOVE IT."}
{"text":"I don't know what happened to this place. It used to be decent tasting. Nothing worth praising but also not so bad that I would review before I even left the place. I don't know if its under new owners or what but their food is down right atrocious now. They blanched the heck out of the shrimp and crawfish and served it to us practically dry. When we asked for more sauce the waiter said they needed to talk to the manager. Apparently this their new \"proportions\". Aside from the terrible food the attitudes of the people involved need to addressed as well. They were so rude. You would think we were asking for gold. It's not like we were expecting California quality food but this is unacceptable. Considering that everything is cheaper in Arizona I don't know how they are needing to save money on seasoning like they aren't making a profit already. If the places In California can serve good food and still bear the California prices then they should be able to too."}
{"text":"I have had the hot n juicy sauce as well as the garlic and butter.  Both are good but I like the garlic and little better.  The fresh crawfish is great but the shrimp and crab legs are my favorite!"}
{"text":"I went here for my big's birthday because normally i wouldn't choose to come here but im glad i did. This type of seafood is not my favorite but i tried a half pound of shrimp with hot n juicy flavor and BABY SPICE level LOL. I cant take spicy at all and my friends gave me a lot of shit for getting baby spice so beware hahaha. But it was really good and i can definitely see the appeal of this restaurant. The only thing is that it felt really chaotic there which is understandable on a friday night. However our servers and food runners were really confused or something. Like 4 different people asked us about these 2 pounds of medium shrimp and we was like nah son we already got it!! They also overcharged us and we had to get that fixed. It was hectic in there. Also apparently theres this ongoing debate of hot n juicy vs boiling crab. I def need to try boiling crab so i can choose a team. I will come back an update zont worry. 3 stars because service was spotty and they didnt have corn fritters WHICH I WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO TRYING :(   I came here like 3 days ago... And i swear my fingers still smell LOL like i even wore gloves while eating??"}
{"text":"Me and my husband to Vegas just to eat here once a year. Not for the strip or the night life but for hot and juicy crawfish! We call it our heaven on earth. Try it once you'll be hooked for life"}
{"text":"It is rare to have restaurants like this that people needs to peel shrimps and eat crawfish in the states, but I enjoyed it so much, as the process of eating is fun as well. I went to this restaurant by myself without any hesitation, and then ordered half pound of shrimp and one pound of crawfish. The waitress is very friendly and explains the menu in detail. The food is served on table within 2 minutes, when it is a Sunday evening and the whole restaurant is already full. The spice smells terrific, and both dishes taste so good. I finished them like a hog! If you enjoy spicy food, this is definitely a must to go place!"}
{"text":"I got this recommendation from a Las Vegas Hoya!  What a great recommendation it was.  I have seen this place recently near Woodley Park on Connecticut Avenue in Washington, D.C.  I have to pay it a visit.  This place is worthy of All-Madden status.  Crab Legs with a delicious blend of Cajun and Creole spices in a bag.  It does not get much better than this.  The crawfish etoufee appetizer is wonderful--more like a soup than the traditional etoufee I am used to.  I had the stone crab legs which were wonderful, but I think the King Crab legs are the best.  This is not a place you would see Rachel Ray at, but I love it!  Thanks to the Las Vegas Hoyas!  We are Georgetown!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! me and hubby come here alot they always are friendly funny & nice! crablegs are delish !!"}
{"text":"This location is huge inside like my muscles! Ha! Seriously there is a lot of room inside. Speaking of Muscles, we ordered the black mussels. Can I get a \"moan!\" Yes it was good. Blue crab and Shrimp was kick booty. Not over cooked. The very pretty server with braces checked up on us several times to make sure everything was okay. I liked that. When I looked into her eyes, I saw that deep down fire inside her to take care her guests.   Food came quickly, things got dirty, lots of finger licking, had to use protection to avoid the burn... Gloves. I love going here, I love talking about the food, the prices are not bad. The menu is super simple too. Not like Applebee's, however their menu did shrink a little which is good. Remember that viral story of the girl who got fired at Apple Bees for some social media bullshit?   Crabs. I love crabs."}
{"text":"The food is so spicy, it's a nice burn. Buffalo wild wings blazin wings rips my stomach apart and other parts. Hot and Juicy is hot enough to satisfy. Eating the hot rice was a marathon.   Usually when we eat here I have trouble keeping the bill under $80. However!..... this last time I ordered 1lb shrimp and my sweet heart ordered black mussels with 2 pieces of corn and a cup of rice. The total was like $27 bucks."}
{"text":"I said I would give this place another shot, and I'm glad I did.  The food was not only fantastic, the service was a night-and-day difference from the last time I came.  This is not a lazy man's restaurant; It takes work.  It's well worth it too, although, I could use less tourists next time I come, but hey, it's good for business."}
{"text":"Very disappointed! No meat on a 2 lb./ $38 dungeness crab. And green mussels has a big shell and small meat. Tried to complain to the manager and she insulted us by opening the crab in front of us to show it has meat. We have a photo to show how bad quality of the meat was. Service was bad. We asked for our ordered rice 3 times from different waiters/waitress until i finally just got up and requested for it in the counter. Also,  restroom is dirty. 2 star bc the shrimp is delicious and size is acceptable."}
{"text":"Omg we eat here and it was soooooo good coming from Miami we live see food and this place was Super good must try"}
{"text":"Yup, I was one of the many people who saw this place on Man vs. Food. I came on a weekday around 5pm to avoid the crowds. This place gets really busy around 7 and on the weekends. I got 2 pounds of crawfish and a side of fries. Came out close to 30 bucks. Not a bad deal. I think the only problem when I ate the crawfish was that my fingers smelled for quite a while and you will surely smell like garlic so if you plan to go on a date, bring some mints, mouthwash and prepare to take a shower when you get back to your room. But you know what, it;s worth it."}
{"text":"My husband really wanted to try this place on our trip to Vegas, and on our way to the original location (on the same road), we saw this one. Thinking our GPS was wrong, we pulled in. No matter as it was just an additional location. Not wanting to eat alot of food, we ordered a pound of crawfish ($10), a pound of snow crab legs ($16), a corn on the cob and half dozen andouille sausage ($3). Service was attentive (by multiple people) and one of the employees showed us how to peel/eat the crawfish. The sauce we chose for the food was garlic butter and it was fantastic. The seafood was tender and flavorful. My hands still smelled like the seasonings after many hand washings. Guess we should have used gloves. Including a beer and soda, the bill was $34 and well worth every bite and broken shell."}
{"text":"Fist of all we waited an hour. After they sit us we waited another 35 minutes for apps. Our food came out in 20 minutes gaps. We where so hungry and my daughter fell asleep waiting for hers. We just left, They suck no one told us the kitchen was backed up or afford anything while waiting."}
{"text":"I've always seen this place but I never bothered to stop by. It was after I went to the Boiling Crab in Cali did I finally decide to come here.   It's not nearly as good as the Boiling Crab, IMO. I ordered one pound of shrimp (they don't do half a pound like BC) in spicy Cajun, mild. It was the sauce that wasn't really good. Hence why I liked BC's more.   My friends all got different flavors. The Hot N Juicy special tasted like Cajun to me. I did really like the lemon pepper, though. I'll probably get that next time.   We got sweet potato and cajun fries. Sweet potato was okay, but I preferred the Cajun fries. They were yummy.   All in all, it wasn't that bad. I would come back in the future. :)"}
{"text":"Okay, I KNOW the place isn't as good as the Boiling Crab in the LA area, but it's all we have in Vegas. This second location is considerably larger than the first location. When I peeked inside, I was like holy shiz, it's so huge. Most likely I'll be coming here instead of the smaller location. Traffic here will be slow compared to the other one for now since it's just recently opened.  My friend wanted to try this out so we came here for his birthday. I usually get my delicious cajun fries (they're spicy!) and 1 pound of the mild Lemon Pepper seasoned shrimp. Pretty yummy. I don't like the Hot N Juicy Special seasoning (I tried my friend's). I just prefer the lemon pepper. Don't think I'll risk the other seasonings, but I will definitely try them if a friend gets them next time. I believe I've tried them at the other location, but don't recall any of them standing out except the lemon pepper.  I absolutely adore the fries! Hell, just get the sweet potato fries and eat both of them. They both taste yummy. Just make sure you don't wear WHITE when you go eat as you might make a mess on yourself and just wear a dark-colored top. Yes, you get the bib but it doesn't cover all of you. With that being said, enjoy your seafood :)!"}
{"text":"I thought it was time to amend my review.  I love the true cajun flavors as well as the bada$$ spice.  My recommendation is the shrimp because you get more meat than with crawfish, as well as an ear of corn swimming in the garlic, lemony, goodness.  I can't believe I still come here with a shellfish allergy. Lol. I just pop a Benadryl beforehand now."}
{"text":"Im visiting from LA and i had an amazing experience!! The food was so fresh, crawfish is out of season though. I really enjoyed the shrimp and snow crab, my server Randy was great he made the experience worth while."}
{"text":"omg, drool, yum, drool, and repeat!!!! i chose this for crawfish as i saw it being featured on the travel channel.. so when i was in vegas, i HAD to come here! the prices are steep but what do you expect!  delicious ice tea unlimited, and delicious crawfish, and delicious shrimp and fries.. thats about all we ate here. don't take folk who want to have a salad or whatnot because they have NO OTHER FOOD available. no salads and no rice! lol.. we started off with 3 crawfish sauces (ordered by lb) .. the lemon pepper, some garlic one, and some other non memorable one. the lemon pepper was by far the attention grabber because you get a PANG of flavor the minute the juices hit your tongue. however we were not full with just crawfish, fries, and an appetizer of soft shell crab. we decided to get an additional bag of shrimp with lemmon pepper sauce because everyone else was feasting on shrimps and they looked so good! the meal is gona be pricey but it's totally worht it! i wish i knew about the shrimp sooner! either way, a tip: be careful with the spice because even at the lowest level it is FREAKING SPICY!!!!!!!!!! i had to pee 3 times within an HOUR and the last time we were driving back to the strip and i couldnt hold it so we took a detour to a gas station ready to piss on myself already and the gas station had no bathroom! WTFERAK??? i was freakingggg out!!!! needless to say we ended up in old las vegas (downtown) since i found a bathroom! that was bad... so make sure you are careful with the spicyness!!!!!"}
{"text":"second time back in vegas and i decided to check out this second location. the reviews are right, this place is more spacious and comfortable than the original place. but we came on a monday night and it was packed for dinner! we waited about 45miinutes to be seated ..most parties were in 6's. if you come in 2's and 4's might be easier to find a seat. i realized im actually not that big of a fan of crawfish. but i did get my garlic butter shrimp fix and it was yummier than i last remembered! service was a bit spotty though, at times constantly refilling our sodas, and at times non existent. also had the black mussels with hot n juicy sauce which were ok. i definitely think theres something for everyone if you are seafood lovers"}
{"text":"The usual affair: lemon pepper shrimp with baby spice, cajun fries (make sure to dip the fries in the sauce), and a bowl of rice (mix in the sauce). It's so heavenly.... Later, i will regret, because I will have a dragon breath burping for the next few hours. It's totally worth it though.   All the seafood is sold by the pound, except for shrimp which you can get minimum of 1/2lb.   Dont forget to wear the plastic gloves provided. (if not, the sauce will linger in your fingers and you will be sniffing it for the next few hours). To avoid long lines, I usually go between 2 to 4pm for snack.   For the jetsetters: the crawfish and shrimp is TSA approved as carryon. I guess the sauce is not considered liquid. I've flown with Hot n Juicy for about 3 times with no problem. Make sure to triple bag these suckers or it will stink up your carryon very fast!!!"}
{"text":"Went last night with a group of friends. First time. I'm from NYC and spent summers in NJ catching and preparing fresh fish, clams, and crab with my grandparents. I've also eaten seafood on both coasts and here in AZ. This restaurant is way over rated. While the gimmick of no utensils and serving seafood out of plastic bags is different, I cringe at what type of plastic bags they are... Now on to the food review: I ordered a 1.6 lb lobster, garlic butter, baby spice. It was WAY overcooked. So rubbery and chewy I could barely eat it. Couldn't get any waitstaff attention to save my life so I ate most of it anyway. They gave me 10% off which was only $3 off. Wow. I also ordered black mussels. While they were cooked properly, they were so small you'd have to order 3 lbs of them to satisfy any hunger.  My friend ordered boiled shrimp and they were cooked nicely.  Stay far away from the fried shrimp, though. Way too salty and the cornmeal breading was not done well.   So- stay away from the lobster is my tip. I've seen reviews that say the same about over cooking them. If you're gonna pay $30 for a lobster go where they know what they're doing.    Another low point- the waiter had a table of 10 of us and barely checked on us the whole time we were there."}
{"text":"If you've been to Boiling Crab or Red Claw in Orange County, CA, then you'll find this place is fairly comparable - though maybe with much better service.  But honestly, your opinion on which is better will be based entirely on your own specific tastes and what you're used to. (Ex: I was a big fan of Boiling Crab until I started going to Red Claw a few times and the garlicky taste grew on me. Now I love Red Claw and think Boiling Crab is a bit too salty. Some may think Red Claw is too garlicky.  So it all depends. Red Claw not ever having a wait is the biggest influence in my decision to always go to Red Claw now anyway.)    My husband and I were in Vegas and were looking for a place to get good, inexpensive seafood.  Most buffets on the strip definitely don't cut it for me (since seafood is my favorite food), and their seafood is usually not fresh.  Since I love Boiling Crab and Red Claw, I was very excited to find this place on Yelp and we made our way to the original location - as it's a bit more tucked away from the second location, which is a bit more touristy.  I found out later from our server that this location is generally more of a local's spot than the newer location.  So when we arrived at about 7:30 pm on a Thursday night, we were a bit sad there was no parking in the small lot. But thankfully a group of people left shortly after we circled the lot and nearby neighborhood for parking. We got in and were quickly greeted and told that the wait would be about 20 - 30 mins, though maybe quicker because they were cleaning up some tables.  Okay, so while I was waiting, I noticed a few things.  1. The mixture of people in the restaurant was extremely diverse.  I'm sure there were at least 10 different ethnicities there!  The age range was also very wide - from young to old.  This was a great sign, as I noticed EVERYONE in the restaurant seemed to be enjoying their food - the food fit, apparently, for varying taste buds. 2. It was pretty busy in there, but the servers were extremely friendly and were all helping each other throughout the restaurant. No server was strictly confined to only one section or certain tables or customers.  If you stopped any server, they happily got you what you needed. This was honestly rare to see, and I was impressed at how the servers all seemed to interact together as a team rather than stressed out, competitive individuals.  As far as the food, we got our shrimp, sausage, and corn in the hot and spicy sauce at spicy level. The clams, we got in the spicy garlic sauce.  Shrimp - Mostly fresh, juicy, plump, easy to peel and crunchy (sings of freshness).  Clams - Were good, though the actual clams were a bit smaller than I hoped they would be. I guess maybe they just use different clams than what I'm used to at Red Claw.  Sausage - Were not polska kielbasa sausages as we hoped. :( My husband was very disappointed and didn't like them at all, and he normally loves sausages.  Don't get these. Even though I ate them, I didn't enjoy them.  They were pretty oily and fatty tasting in a bad way.  Hot N Juicy sauce - This is similar to Boiling Crab's sauce.  I would say the spicy is pretty spicy, and a little spicier would make it so that you couldn't taste your food very well.  My husband and I have a pretty high tolerance for spicy food, and the spicy here is in between the medium and spicy spiciness at Boiling Crab.  Garlic sauce - We got this sauce spicy, and it tasted fairly similar to the Cajun garlic sauce at Red Claw (though Red Claw uses tons of real chopped garlic and is much better, in my opinion).  My husband liked this sauce over the Hot N Juicy sauce, which is ironic since I'm usually more of the garlic lover.  Cajun fries - Fries sprinkled with Cajun seasoning.  The fries were good and crispy and moist on the inside.  The Cajun seasoning is pretty spicy, so be mindful of that if you don't like things too spicy.  They were good fries. :)  Overall, this was definitely a great place for good Cajun-style seafood.   The service was great, and the food really good.  Overall, I'd definitely go here again the next time I'm in Vegas and craving seafood.  Be warned though that your hair, skin, and clothes will smell like your food.  I suggest you keep jackets and sweaters in your car and wear something you don't mind stinking up.  You'll probably have to take a shower when you get home, unless you don't mind smelling the food on your hair and skin while sleeping. :)"}
{"text":"Hot and juicy is right, stumbled upon this place, and we weren't disappointed, fun food, fun place, we'd come back again!! FYI FOOD IS SPICY, we got the mild and it was great!!"}
{"text":"I have been here many times and usually get the shrimp.  This time I got crawfish and I kick myself for doing it.  The crawfish were so small and soft that they were a pain in the butt to eat.  A few were so small that I just ate the whole thing shell and all.  It was like eating a soft shelled crab.  Oh well, live and learn.  No more crawfish for me, I'll stick to the shrimp."}
{"text":"We had friends in town from Virginia over the summer. Hot N Juicy Crawfish was on their list of places they wanted to try during their Las Vegas food adventure.  This was also the first time my guy and I ventured in as well.  I want to be clear that in no way is Hot N Juicy a fancy place.  Your food is served in a plastic bag and your drinks are in paper cups.  Make sure your dress casual, expect the possibility of a wait, (as it's located in a smallish space) and have a good time.               I for one was grateful for the cute little plastic bibs available.  Yes, everyone looks cute and it makes for a fun photo op.  But the fact is you get REALLY MESSY!     My guy and I had shrimp.  I chose the garlic butter, medium while my guy had the cajun, medium.  Both were very tasty. Others in our group had crawfish and combos.  All 6 of us enjoyed our food and the experience very much."}
{"text":"I've been a frequent patron of this very busy little joint even before it became famous from that show on the food channel.  Since then every time we go here it's at least 20-40 minute wait unless you get there before 5:30 pm.  I hate waiting and usually would not wait for anything...................... except for this darn hot n juicy crawfish!!  The minute you peel off the head and suck the tamale off the shell you remember why you wait 40 minutes to be seated (the waiting area is standing along the wall), drink off of styrofoam cups and plates and pay $10 a pound (I eat minimum of 5lbs).  Sounds like I'm bitching, but it's soooo damn good you forget about all the \"little\" inconvenience and just saviour the succulent crawfish.  Prepare yourself if you don't like spicy food.  Just a little advice and make sure you ask  for mild if you like medium in a Thai restaurant."}
{"text":"This was hands down the best seafood I have every had.  It was fresh and simple.  I got a 1/2 pound of shrimp and a pound of crab legs with Hot and Juicy Sauce and mild seasoning it was heavenly! The prices are awesome for the size of the shrimp and the amount of crab legs.  I could not stop licking my fingers that damn seasoning was....(there are really no words)!  The seafood is so juicy that I got seasoning in my eye and my eyes began to tear.  Did that stop me...absolutely not!  If I every have to request my last meal I will definitely be eating Hot N Juicy Crawfish!"}
{"text":"We went to boiling crab but there was a 45 minute wait so we came here. Worth the change in plans. Flavor was delicious. Ate king crab, shrimp, crawfish, sausage, chicken fingers, fries (regular and sweet potato), fried fish. All was delicious but the work you put into it seemed like a lot. Thought it was odd that a 1lb of shrimp or the experience meal were brought out in plastic bags and they don't give you plates but that's how they roll here. Waitress was nice but she just recited all the menu items to us. She also forgot to give us gloves per my request. They also were hoarding the cracker. We had to ask. How do you serve crab legs and don't provide cracker? We had 9 people and they only gave 1! We requested another and they mark the number of the table cloth. Apparently people steal the cracker or it gets wrapped up in all the shells and paper towels and accidentally thrown away. Overall good experience. If you're ok with getting messy and eating off the paper table cloth. It cost $1 for butter. I'm surprised they don't give you butter to dip the crab legs in."}
{"text":"This place really deserves the 5 stars.. its a tad bit pricy but worth it. I had the shrimp with the medium hot n juicy marinade they got.. let me say that medium had a real good kick to it. I also ordered the soft shell crab basket and it comes with fries deep fried soft shell crab and it also is really great. But the softshell crab basket is not that big at all..  People need to try this place for sure.. I would give it the full 5 stars it deserves but its jus a lil pricy like I said in the begining with 1lb of shrimp. The soft shell crab basket and 2 drinks it came out to $30.. we left there hungry because its very little for wat you get. But definitely worth chrcking it out"}
{"text":"Take it from a real live coonass cajun...This ain't it. Dumping a ton of cayenne pepper on something does NOT make it Louisiana!"}
{"text":"Food was fantastic server Loreal was awesome even showed us how to eat the crawfish there signature sauce was so good I wish there was a way to bring it on the plane home I even ordered extra on the side"}
{"text":"After seeing this restaurant featured on the Man vs. Food show, we headed over to try it out.  We ordered the shrimp and crab in their mild garlic butter sauce with corn and potatoes.  It was fresh and delicious with a spicy edge (even for mild).  Be prepared to dig in and get dirty.  I highly recommend using the \"stylish\" plastic apron they provide.  We oozed garlic from our pores for about two days!"}
{"text":"After our 3 month break from Hot N Juicy we decided to give it another try. Tried 2 other \"similar\" restaurants, even tried to make some at home! Was missing that Hot N Juicy finger licking good flavor!!  Due to our past experience my girlfriend was contacted by Jill and offered us a free round of drinks for our table if we ever decided to come back, we were hesitant at first but it was my brother in laws bday and he had been wanting to try this place. So here we are again, and boy was I happy we came back! . As soon as we got there you can tell the customer service had already improved, seen some new smiling faces!  I let Cat( I LOVE HER VOICE!) know what Jill told me and right away she made sure everyone received the free round of drinks even added some fried brownies. Food was to die for as always!! We even took some newbies with us and they kept saying they didn't like Crawfish and Hot N Juicy changed their mind. Everyone was happy with the whole experience. The staff kept checking on us making sure no one was left thirsty. And it was not just our table that received the special attention it was everyone in the restaurant! Shout out to all the servers helping each other out! Every one worked as a team and made everything outstanding! Thank you for accepting the feedback and making this place back to #1 in our book!"}
{"text":"Awesome food. Absolutely delicious. We had shrimp, lobster, mussels, crab legs and crawfish (which I personally feel are a waste of time and energy to eat) but bottom line this place is great. We actually loved the  butter and garlic sauce which is not typical butter and garlic. All the sauces have a Cajun prep to them. But it had more flavor than their hot n juicy sauce. Go and try. If you love seafood and don't mind heads on shrimp...you'll love this place."}
{"text":"Thanks to fellow yelpers, we decided to give Hot N Juicy Crawfish a try.  We weren't disappointed.    The table was lined with plastic.  The seafood and corn were boiled in thick plastic bags with your choice of sauce.  We had 2 lbs of shrimp, 1 lb of crawfish, 1 lb of snow crab legs, a basket of catfish and cajun fries, 5 bowls of rice, 3 corn on the cobs, all in that delicious hot n juicy sauce, spicy.  It was mouthwatering good!!  If you are freaked out with shrimp and crawfish all still dressed, go for it!  It was the best seafood I've had in a long time.   There was a ton of garlic in the sauce.  So good!!  Paper towels are provided for your messy hands.    There was a couple who was from Louisiana who actually sought out this restaurant and they also loved the food!    Get there quick!  BTW, don't forget to wear your bib so you don't get that sauce all over your clean clothes!"}
{"text":"Hot N Juicy Crawfish restaurant no. 2 is just as good as restaurant no. 1!  I like this restaurant as it's much bigger and airier.  The food is just as good as no. 1.  I noticed that when you order the medium spicy sauce, it is medium and not screechingly hot and if it's mild, it does come mild.  In other words, the sauce come as ordered.  We ordered 3lbs of shrimps and it was so good, we ordered another lb of shrimp!  Also, we ordered the catfish and cajun fries and some rice to sop up that wonderful sauce!!    Will be back!"}
{"text":"Great food excellence service wasn't very crowded n we had a nice meal. Would definitely go back n have dinner. I'm from Louisiana n the seafood we had was very good n fresh. See ya next time. Good luck with your new location"}
{"text":"It has been a while since my last visit at Hot n Juicy, I was craving that basket from Boiling Crab but I drove by Hot N Juicy for the time being on my lunch break. Upon my arrival I was very indecisive when reading the menu. I was going to order the usual food I would get however the waiter Max did mention the King crab and shrimp, So I lived a little that day. I appreciate the recommendation of the gentleman that help me with my order. Satisfaction guaranteed. Id say for excellent service recommend this guy to be your server. You wont be disappointed. Cheers."}
{"text":"Wife and I ate here twice last week!  We ordered crab legs, shrimp, and crawfish w/ hot n spicy and lemon pepper sauce - mild heat.  This place is wayyy better than Boiling crab."}
{"text":"$1 Sapporo beers??!!!  Count me in!  Husband and I went walking mill ave looking for something new for date night.  I'm from CA and loved Boiling crab, seeing this was a similar atmosphere. I was in.   Husband isn't big on seafood, he was obsessed! Talked about it for days  We got 2lbs of shrimp  1lb of snow crab (which was about 6-7 pretty large legs)  All in \"hot and juicy\" flavoring. No spice, however it was pretty spicy!!!  & some Cajun fries.   Service was excellent, our server took the time to explain everything on the menu  Music & crowd was great! We were expecting a lot more chaos being it was the first week of school at ASU   All that plus 4 beers for around $50!! We were stuffed & happy!"}
{"text":"It's my favorite Cajun seafood place in town!!! All those others crawfish places can't beat HnJ! Why!? Cuz it's all about the sauce baby!! Their HnJ sauce is so special to my heart and most to my mouth!! If you like spicy flavorful garlicky kinda food HnJ is ya kinda place!!! I left one star out cuz we are in the desert seafood here comes frozen"}
{"text":"Very yummy! My husband and I have eaten here twice in the last year. I had eaten here about 6 months earlier and liked it, but the spicy option was so spicy it made my lips literally peel. I do not mean literally like most kids today do. I mean, it LITERALLY made the skin come off of my lips. I normally can take a lot of spice, but the combo in the spicy option was way too much for me. I enjoyed it while eating it, but the next few days were torture. The next trip I ordered the lowest grade of spice (can't remember the name) and enjoyed it thoroughly. It was still nicely spicy, but no loss of skin. :) The sauce is very flavorful, so much so that I ordered extra biscuits just to dunk in the sauce. I am not a bread girl and normally pass on it. I've seen complaints that the crawfish are expensive for the amount of meat involved, but I felt the pricing was very fair. You will NOT be able to replicate the sauce at home and the crawfish itself is priced close to market. You MUST check this place out, you will be happy you did!"}
{"text":"All I can say about this spot is: MMMMMMM Good!!  Prices are unbeatable and the food is good!  I take all my loved ones and co workers here every time I'm visiting Sin City!"}
{"text":"They charged us more than market listed price by a few dollars food was average tasted like everything had too much celery salt on it ... Not a good experience ... I would rather eat at angry crab any day way better food and this place only gives you one wet nap for real lets not be cheap now .."}
{"text":"After listening to my GF and her sister rant and rave about \"Hot N Juicy Crawfish\" in a manner that, I swear, included dilated pupils and a lil bit of drool coming from the corner of their mouths... I said, alright, if they place is so good, I'll take both of you there for lunch and it's my treat! Little did I know that this may be the most over priced restaurant in Las Vegas... And that's a fiercely competitive category.  First of all, if you're not into eating your overpriced Cajun style food from the same plastic bag it was cooked in, then you won't like this place.   Now, pleeeeeze don't get me wrong, all the food we ordered TASTED GREAT!!! Big time... Although I recommend either be Mild or Medium spiciness levels, since the mild is hotter than most restaurant's Medium. My crab legs were delicious although a pound of them yields about 2 ounces of actual crab meat. The sausage was fast and the only item not so grossly overpriced. The corn was just OK, and the beverages were not up to the standards of an average Wendy's. For three of us, with only a single beer, an iced tea and an Arnold Palmer for beverages, the total for three of us with tip came to $118.00 and was $97.22 before gratuity.   I am not a cheap diner, for example, I don't think twice about the cost of a Morton's or THE golden Steer or even the Fagao Do Chao Brazilian restaurant in Las Vegas... But, they at least provide cutlery, silverware, genuine plates, cups, glasses, great service and keep your table fairly clean. Hot N Juicy brings your meal out in a plastic bag, warns you to put their chintzy and inadequate bib on to protect your clothing and wishes you the best of luck with only a seafood shell cracker and a plastic poker to dig the meat out of your food. Their napkins are not up to the task and look like the stuff used by high school cafeterias... Despite rudimentary service, a lack of utensils, throw away beverage containers and the overwhelming presence of enough plastic to cause a petrochemical shortage... And undersized portions... The food was as tasty as I was told... But no better prepared or quality than many other restaurants that provide dinnerware, utensils, cloth napkins, bibs that are OK for those bigger than a toddler and much better service.    My three star rating is justified by the excellent flavor and preparation, as well as fast service as they rush you to get out so they can turn the table and make more money... I envy the owner of this place because with a 15% food cost and no dish washing expenses, the menu prices must make this business a Hot N Juicy Cash Cow!"}
{"text":"I was in town for a Vegas trip and my friends wanted to go and get Pho in the shopping center and I saw this place and said,\"Oh this is where the Hot N Juicy Crawfish is!\" I saw this restaurant on unique eats and I was hoping to eat there at one point or another. So the following day we want here to eat before leaving Vegas.  We came in a little after they opened, it wasn't too busy. Probably 7 other parties but more came later. Hostess sat us in a booth and the server came not too long after.   Since this place is very similar to boiling crab I ordered what I always order. I ordered a pound of shrimp, i got it hot n juicy medium and cajun fries. I got my fries first, they were tasty but I kind of expected it to be more spicy, but that's ok it definitely helped satisfy my craving for cajun fries. Then my shrimp arrived, I opened it up and dived right in and my goodness this sauce was so damn good! It definitely did not disappoint me! I wish I ordered a pound and a half. I also had a bowl of rice with this and by the time I was done I was completely stuffed. I'll be sure to come back here next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Seafood is my go-to for anything. I haven't been to Hot N Juicy in a while but it definitely exceeded my expectations. I got half a pound of shrimp, hot'n'juicy mild and the quality was stupendous. The shrimp were big and filling. The service from Max Kim and Rachel was the best service I have ever received. They excel in professional service. They constantly were refilling my water, asking if we needed anything and their optimism perfects on what a server should be. I will defintely come back."}
{"text":"Eating seafood with my bare hands has never sounded like a better idea. We ordered shrimp, crawfish, crab, and mussels. I had no idea there were so many animals in the ocean.  We started with appetizers of fries and calamari, the latter of which did not have much and was $11 to top it off. Despite the poor start I was in a good mood because it was still bright outside. Nothing is worse than looking out the window and realizing the sun sets at 5pm.  The waitress asked what level of spice we wanted and we said medium, which turned out to be almost more than we could handle. They definitely tend to be on the hotter side, and I'm not just talking about the waitresses. If you have congested sinuses I would still recommend Nasonex.  The snow crab legs were delicious, but I'm starting to feel a bit guilty. I don't think the crab will be able to get around very well without his legs. I've seen enough Deadliest Catch to know that being a crustacean is hard enough. Best of luck to you Mr. Crab _______  Just like Boiling Crab back home! Pricing is fair and service is good. The food won't quite fill you up but if you're up for a messy meal you won't be disappointed.  Allen"}
{"text":"This was my First and last time at this restaurant. Not only did our food come out at different times, they brought out the wrong food, appetizer came out in the middle of the Neal and my friends food never came out at all. The waitress didnt seem concerned until we asked for it to be taken off the bill and then the mgr finally got involved. Then when the bill came it included the food that we didnt order. Will never go back."}
{"text":"I'm southern. I love seafood. This is NOT southern seafood faire. I ordered fried shrimp. It was covered in a cornbread BATTER... No no no no... There is no such thing for shrimp in the south. Its JUST cornbread but not on shrimp! A meal mate ordered crawfish. They were TINY... Not enjoyable.  If you like the food there.. don't go south and expect to find the same.  Its really much better at Angry Crab.. but even they are not true southern seafood pleasure."}
{"text":"Pretty good compared to the other two in Las Vegas. I like that this one seems more for locals and not crowded with tourist.   The shrimp were cooked perfectly, I find that the other locations tend to over cook them. I like the lay out of this one a lot more then the others.   I was impressed overall considering they have only been opened for only 2 hours!   My only complaint is that the sauces didn't really seem the same which is why I took a star off. However that star will work its way back up since its only their first night open!!"}
{"text":"Came here the other night and order my usual 1 lb of lemon pepper shrimp and with it came limes. WHAT?! Limes?!?! So I give it a try, I figure well if they are serving them with it, it has to be amazing.....It was!! Next time I think I will try the hot n juicy sauce with the limes."}
{"text":"Fried soft shelled crabs with Cajun fries-delicious 1 lb shrimp with garlic butter sauce in spicy-delicious 1 lb shrimp with hot n juicy sauce in spicy-delicious 1 lb clams lousiana sauce in mild-o.k. I prefer the flavor of their food over The Boiling Crab"}
{"text":"Still love Hot N Juicy better than the Boiling Crab. I had shrimp with garlic sauce in mild because my lips were chapped and didn't want it to burn even more. Still spicy but still so good. I tasted the corn fritters that weren't on the menu a year ago. Very good, but they should try serving it with something else other than catsup. I've had them served with hot pepper jelly elsewhere & it's a good combination.  I didn't care much for our waitress, but the blond girl who rung us up was sooo nice. My sister liked our waitress though."}
{"text":"I'm an avid lover for Boiling Crab, but when that place gets too crowded Hot n' Juicy comes in second for me.  Personally, I'm a shrimp lover. I love a little spice to my food, but not too much where my nose is running. With that said, I get the shrimp with the Hot n' Juicy season mild. No surprise here that I have to order a side of cajun fries. I feel like you can't go to these types of restaurant and NOT order a side of cajun fries.  The only difference with the sauce is that this one seems a tad bit sweeter than Boiling Crab. I'm still a lover either way =) This place also has a bigger selection on beer.  So if you're into cajun food, but want to drink tons of beer as well - this place takes it over Boiling Crab. Although both places are good and you can't go wrong with either."}
{"text":"Hot and Juicy Crawfish - Don't know if there are other places to eat louisiana style crawfish but this place is pretty good. Best place in vegas for now! HAHA. The crawfishes are pretty decent size and the spices are good. Unlike other places I have had, when u tell them mild, it is mild. When you tell them medium, its medium and so forth. The catfish basket is so-so here. I have had better, I don't like the way it is breaded. The Dungeoness Crab is VERY GOOD. They tend to run out so if you are going there for dungeoness, you may want to call before hand. My boyfriend won a contest with 4 other people.... 20 LBS is 5 minutes! Hahahahahah!   I prefer boiling crab in oc & alhambra and everywhere (they are a chain/franchise) but this is as good as it is gonna get in vegas til they open one!"}
{"text":"The crawfish here lives up to the hype!  The waitress warned us that their spice level is one level hotter than other places.  I don't know if I'd agree with that.  I ordered the medium spice level (which I usually order at other places) and it was about as hot as expected.  Definitely not too hot.  What I really liked about their crawfish was that they were HUGE.  the crawfish were so big that we even decided to crack open their claws bc there was actually meat in there too.  What did not meet my expectations was the oysters.  We ordered a half dozen of the raw oysters and they just weren't tasty.  The flavor was weak and tasted watered down for some reason.  The only way to salvage the oysters was to pile on horseradish and cocktail sauce, which was a shame.  I usually love to eat oysters raw with nothing else to take away from the great oyster flavor.  I also tried a pound of the green mussels.  They were good, but not great.  I was disappointed that in my bag of about 15 mussels there were 4 empty shells.  Also they were slightly overcooked and ended up being a bit more rubbery than I would have liked.  Overall, I would still come here again, but I'd stick to the crawfish!"}
{"text":"I have to be tough on the one.  Seafood is my favorite and I have had some.of the best in the U.S. that being said. It was not bad for a chain and I may come back when I am in Arizona and just really craving seafood!"}
{"text":"Food here is mediocre. Nothing special, had the shrimp with their seasoning that has everything (forgot the name) and it was bland.   I also ordered a fried catfish basket and when all the food was brought out that was missing. Waitress said it'll be out soon. 10mins later I see another waitress give that order to a table that had come in AFTER we did and the waitress still said it was coming. She comes back 15mins later and says it was given to another table by mistake.  Each time I asked her about it, she just seemed to ignore me.   Only good thing that came out of the meal with my mom was that they didn't charge for the fried catfish after having me wait 30+minutes. Basically, I didn't get it until we had finished our meal."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Cajun/creole shrimp! When I was living in california I was a frequent visitor to boiling crab. Once we moved here to Vegas I had tried out boiling crab here and it was disgusting! So here I was in search of a new place to fulfill cravings...and I can honestly tell you that hot n juicy is BETTER than boiling crab! Seriously it's delicious. I went back to San Jose's boiling crab a few days after I had hot n juicy and it does not compare! Their sauce has an extra kick to it and they use less butter for sure. I am a definite fan of this place now."}
{"text":"Lord, My family cannot get enough of Hot N Juicy that we went back twice in one week. The crab legs are always great the hot n juicy seasoning is perfection. The catfish is great too. The staff was very friendly and the atmosphere was really relaxed. We will Definitely be back and has traveled across the country to eat it at each Hot N Juicy restaurant."}
{"text":"This place has been the best crawfish restaurant I have ever been to! I have tried ones in Reno and all in California but so far this place has the greatest types of sauce and worthy size seafood for the price. The staff here was very helpful and friendly! I ordered a pound of shrimp with the hot n juicy intermediate. If you can handle it and enjoy spicy food then it would be the best sauce to try! I was very impressed on how they offered gloves to make it less of a hassle to get your fingers dirty. Great taste in music and atmosphere"}
{"text":"This was my first time here from moving to Vegas a couple of weeks ago and took my husband here for his birthday dinner. The staff is very friendly and took care of us. Great atmosphere !!"}
{"text":"Good food - bad service! :( We came as a party of 3 and were told that it was going to be a 10m wait. We waited and waited. There were many uncleaned tables, and it took them 20m to finally clean one and another 15m after cleaning that one to seat us. The server came to take our order right away but we didn't see her again until after we had to STAND UP, WALK TO THE BAR AREA AND REQUESTED TO ORDER MORE AND HAVE OUR DRINKS REFILLED!!! I mean really? That meant she didn't check on us at all for a good 45m, after we finished our cajun fries and 5lbs of crawfish!!! What did she do meanwhile you might ask? She was CLEANING TABLES! Like come on!!! When we needed the tables to be clean, you didnt clean it. She decided to clean tables when there were literally only 2 people waiting. Ugh!!!! If it wasnt for the great flavors of food, this would have been a 1 star review!! Im a server myself so I found this experience to be very frustrating!!!"}
{"text":"Always a great experience! This was a cleaner , slower location and the food was perfect as always!! Loved the quick service , we were in and out"}
{"text":"Great customer service. I will return and my take out order was ready and hit when I got there.  You know me I love walking into a Resturant and seeing it's busy. Let's me know it's popping. And it was. In and out was all I had time for. My belly is happy and now I can go back to sleep and get ready for tomorrow."}
{"text":"Crawfish potato and corn.. Just excellent. Service was fast and kept coming by to check up on me. Looking forward to the next time."}
{"text":"Hot n Juicy is crap!!!  I can't imagine why it has four stars and why people are comparing it's goodness to boiling crab!  This place doesn't even come close to BC, and I'm not just referring to the food.  First of all, there's nothing hot n juicy about the food they serve!  The sauce is so boring!!! it lacks so much flavor and is freaking watery.  It seems like the shrimp was cooked, steamed, then tossed in the bag along with the sauce.  If this is how they do it, they're missing out on some major flavor absorption within the shrimp!  Not to compare it to boiling crab, but you can tell BC lets their shrimp stew in the sauce because every piece is saturated with it's yumminess.  Anyway, that's all I've bothered trying here.  To make things worse their prices are a tad bit more expensive and definitely not worth paying for watered down shrimp in a bag.  Moreover, they do not use fine ground pepper!  Ugh, who wants to have big ass chunks of ground pepper on their shrimp??!! How hard is it to invest in FINE ground pepper??  Yes, it's that important and yes, it makes a difference in taste.  All food aside, the decor of this place sucks too!  They have these tacky posters of all this French stuff.. Why???!? of all places would you have these hanging at a restaurant that is totally irrelevant to the type of food being served?!  Also, I think the pictures of people on one side of the wall looks weird.  Whatever, I gave this place a try every time I  had my sporadic craving of BC (twice).  Will I try again?? I'll probably just wait til I'm back in the bay to satisfy my hunger because hot n juicy ain't hot or juicy enough for me.  Btw. Service is just alright.  Nothing major and nothing to make note of.  Oh, and if you pay with cash I believe you get 10% off your check."}
{"text":"Amazing seafood...Great staff......I was hoping for the oysters on the half shell would have been just a bit more fresh.... Not a fan,,,,  Everything else is amazing!"}
{"text":"I'm comparing this to Boiling Crab...it's not as good and here's why...the sauce is different, kinda tastes like they put cream in there, not worse just different. The clams were not washed well and had sand bits in them. Anyone who's bit into a grain of sand knows what I'm talking about. The catfish basket was more expensive, had a subpar batter and had much less catfish than they give at BC. One thing I'll give them credit for is their shrimp...big and super fresh. BC has tendency for old shrimp that become mushy, so this is one area BC could improve on."}
{"text":"Not a place for a first date... unless... you really want to get to know her/him... it's messy, it's SOOOOOO GOOOOD! I'm currently craving the bag full of succulent shrimp. I could only snap my fingers and be there now. YUM"}
{"text":"If you're looking for an adventure in Las Vegas when it comes to food, this is the place to go (and this adventure isn't for the weak!) I had to say I was extremely sketchy because you get a pound or more of crawfish freshly boiled, mixed in with their seasonings and sauces, and you have to be the one to crack them open yourself to get to the crawfish meat, but that is the whole experience and beauty of the restaurant.   I wish I could try their other sauces and seasoning, but I feel even the next step up from what is considered mild is way too spicy and hot for me. Guess I need to work on becoming a novice here! Anyways, this location is always busy, and expect a bit of a wait every time you come (larger parties are always going to be an hour of more). I rate this 4 stars because this is a very interesting experience when it comes to dining! Be fearless!"}
{"text":"I must admit I only wanted to try this place to compare it to my favorite spot in Cali. After doing so, I still have my #1 favorite but this one is pretty good as well. I first ordered 1 pound of shrimps, 1 pound of blue crabs and one basket of catfish (pretty much my usual). I shared it of course with my sis. Both shrimp and crab was made in the Hot n Spicy sauce mild. Some of my friends got the highest spice level (cringe). The shrimps were huge compared to what I'm use too! This was the first thing that came out and me and my sis went thru it pretty fast and since she wasn't having any of the crabs we decided to get another pound.... terrible mistake cause she got pretty full so we ended up sharing with our whole group hehe. I lucked out on the crab. Both females!!! and I love the eggs so I was a happy camper :D   One thing and its a very little thing, the cajan fries were not very cajan. It was barely seasoned to what I'm use to... But this place is definitely GREAT!!! Make it a place to stop by if your partying in vegas for the weekend"}
{"text":"I've been to HnJs in Vegas and both of the ones in Arizona now and I must say that things are pretty consistent!  Service, that Hot n Juicy sauce [I'll be tasting and smelling of this for a couple of days], and even the decor are all the same.  They even send in the same pretty lady to all their stores to help gets things off the ground given by what she has said at their Tempe grand opening.  Anyways, I pretty much always order the same items:  Hot N Juicy crawfish, lemon pepper shrimp, a basket of their cajun fries, and their oysters.  Their oysters are always a gamble though since you can never tell when they're fresh until you actually bite into one.  After the past few hit-and-misses, I think I'll pass on their oysters from now on.  They are currently serving frozen crawfishes as it's not in season so I say hold off until summer if you can.  If not, they're still big and plump but nothing beats fresh crawfishes.  This is such a great and prime location for Hot n Juicy!  Now the west valley folk can get their fill of seafood and the Tempe location can be all mine... MINE!  Best of luck to HnJ!"}
{"text":"Although Hot N Juicy has been opened for a few weeks now, yesterday was their official grand opening!  Hearing that there's an amazing \"buy 1lb of crawfish and get 1lb free,\" we decided to put off our visit until yesterday.  Being patrons of their Las Vegas location for years already, we were pretty excited to have our very own location here in Phoenix.  Too bad metered parking on Mill Ave sucks butt but oh well!  For their grand opening, there were balloons, a red carpet, a cheesy Hot N Juicy backdrop, and people giving away swanky Corona Extra t-shirts and necklaces.  We arrived exactly at noon and was told there was a 30min wait that ended up being an hour wait.  Oh well!  We got to stand around inside enjoying some sparkling cider, A/C, and being photographed by this sweet gentleman.  After being seated, everything just flew by!  We each ordered 2lbs of crawfish [Hot N Juicy seasoning, medium spice] with an extra pound free and 1lb of shrimp [Lemon Pepper, medium spice].  I never felt so full after eating 2lbs of crawfish in my life!  I barely even touch the shrimp and it had to be taken togo with my extra pound of crawfish.    The Hot N Juicy seasoning has always been my go-to even after all these years of going to Hot N Juicy.  It's the perfect combination of spices, garlic chunks, and herbs.  I like being able to see it coating my crawfishes.  Lemon Pepper is my second favorite because it's a bright sauce with a nice bite of black pepper.  This stuff coats the shrimp well too.  I'm not sure if it's the gratification of not having to drive five-hours to get to Vegas but the crawfish seemed to be even better in this Arizona location.  The service was great, the wait staff and managers were really friendly and checked-up on our table frequently despite how busy it was, and we even got to see the owner!  It was like being on Man v. Food!  I will DEFINITELY be back again.  No more having to drive to Las Vegas for crawfish.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"WOW!!! Love this place!! I serve in a local restaurant and actually tell my customers about this place. My daughter and I try to go at least once a week! Not only is the crawfish fabulous but they have the freshest oysters i have ever eaten! Always happy and unpretentious servers that are attentive, always keeping my drink filled. I will keep wrestling with the dilemma of spreading the word of this place but afraid that too many people that know about it will ruin it. Last time i was there i overheard a couple of ignorant patrons complaining, obviously they have no idea what good taste is. Can't fix unsophisticated taste palates. Let them eat elsewhere, perhaps a hamburger chain. We will continue to patronize as long as they are open!!!"}
{"text":"Caught this on TV and book marked it for our frequent trips to Vegas.  Also, there's a place in Houston that I've been to that was voted top crawfish joint in the city that has a very similar concept.  That place was good so I had to check Hot and Juicy out.  The concept is brilliant - pick your seafood, pick your quantity and pick your seasoning (or just fry it).  No muss, no fuss.  Prices are relatively cheap and the food is tasty.  Our server was great and we really didn't wait long to be seated (maybe 5 minutes).  In that respect, I guess we were lucky with parking too, but I can see how it may be a cluster on other nights.  My one pet peeve is no full bar, but I'll live."}
{"text":"The service was great here and the entire staff was friendly. The food was also good. We were looking for fried seafood. The calamari could have been seasoned a bit more but I added Cajun season (which was super hot) lemon and dipped them them in the marinara sauce and they were good. The shrimp was seasoned well and all the food was hot when it came out l. The catfish was good also. The only thing that I could have asked for was regular hot sauce (not tabasco) and a basket with both shrimp and catfish."}
{"text":"Messy and delicious! We got a pound of Louisiana style spicy crawfish and a pound of the hot n juicy special medium shrimp. Our waitress told us that the \"spicy\" level was really really spicy, but it was still an enjoyable spice in my opinion. The service was great and the food came out fast. Definitely a fun and unique dining experience getting messy and peeling the shrimp/crawfish all over the table. My hands still smell like the sauces from all the peeling, but I don't care because the sauce was so good!"}
{"text":"Get ready to get messy! I love this place. You eat with your hands and no one cares. The beer and shrimp is a perfect combo."}
{"text":"The wait was over an hour but it was on a Friday night. When we got seated they ran out of some seafood. The reason for four stars was the fun atmosphere the waitress provided.  She was having fun with the large party we had (10 people). The food was very spicy and full of flavor. The crab and crawfish were the best. My brother also ordered fried catfish. He enjoyed that too. We are heading back for another good time."}
{"text":"I love this hotnjuicy location the servers here are really nice but one server stands out the most her name is Rachel she always smiles and talks to the customers to make sure u are alright. I know that is what you are suppose to do but I feel she goes above and beyond and she is why I keep coming back and bringing more people in plus this location taste better to me but it's a plus when Rachel is there."}
{"text":"It appears that this restaurant recently opened. It is located in an Asian strip mall. There seems to be ample parking along the whole area. When we went there this Saturday noon, there was luckily not a wait.   The employees here were very accomodating. Kudos to their excellent service. Also, the food was great. I think the shrimp was actually the best thing I had here. I also had crawfish, etoufee, and clams. We got the Hot N Juicy Crawfish spice mix and everything was about medium spiciness.   Even their bibs were of premium quality, although the question of the day is, why is there a lobster on the bib? Isn't it a crawfish place?"}
{"text":"Amazing! Crawfish are best when in season and FRESH.. I went here in the off season, when the crawfish are frozen, and they were STILL delicious. Also tried the shrimp, the cajun fries (a bit too spicy for us) and the corn fritters (OMG!!).  Everything is messy, juicy, and so satisfying..  During the summer its recommended to call ahead for seating or just expect a wait. Our waitress told us this place is usually PACKED.   We will continue to come here when we visit Vegas.. The perfect lunch spot after an foot massage in Chinatown :)"}
{"text":"I stopped by because it was recommended by Adam Man vs Food and overall the restaurant was easy to find, looked acceptable, I found Adam's picture on the wall. I had never had crawfish before so I didn't know what to expect.  I ordered crawfish and shrimp.  The food was good and I didn't give Hot & Juicy a higher rating because half of the crawfish were so small it wan't worth the trouble to try to eat it and the waitress wasn't friendly or welcoming.   The shrimp was excellent but I don't think I'll order the crawfish again."}
{"text":"Hot N Juicy is my go-to spot in the Valley for boiled crawfish.  I've been to Angry Crab and wasn't impressed with the flavors.  I prefer the flavors of HnJ.  The Boiling Crab is still my favorite, but since we don't have one here, HnJ will do just fine. It's definitely pricey, but it's worth it once in a while to get my crawfish fix."}
{"text":"First time, I come here with my brothers, I was so surprise about their service. Amazing fresh seafood. The seasoning is unforgettable. So, we started to order craw fish, shrimp, crab and oyster. When the food come out, I was so excited that I can open the bag of food and eat it right away, but it was too hot to eat.  I had the shrimp Cajun style with medium spice and it was outstanding. My brother got crawfish and he loved it, the flavor was great for everything. It was so fun when you eat food by your hands, but absolutely they give us glove and an apron with the logo of Hot N Juicy Crawfish.  This is a nice place, nice decorations, awesome music. The sever took care of us very carefully and took time to explain the menu. I had been try in different place have seafood, but I love this place. This is petty good to have fresh seafood in Arizona :)  I would have no problem going back here when in the mood for fresh seafood.  Just make sure you aren't wearing white when you go :)"}
{"text":"DUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUDE. WHAAAAAAAAT.  Alright, so, I have NOT been to any type of boiling crab, hot n juicy type of place since 2009 or so. After trying out boiling crab in LA at two locations (the original in Alhambra and then koreatown thereafter), I sorta \"gave up\" on it. I thought I was crazy, since I seemed to be the exception to the rule...EVERYONE LOVES THIS STUFF.   Well, I wanted to give it another stab. I really didn't like the flavors too much at boiling crab, and thanks HOT N JUICY, I have renewed hope!!!  I loved the MILD sauce flavor A LOT, and it tasted VERY different from boiling crab or some other places I've tried.   The corn with the mild sauce was SEW GOOD. The shrimp was my fave!  I love snow crab, but, it's hard since you can't get much of the sauce in the crab meat, and I just love snow crab on it's own. Plus, my hands are too lazy for all that workout.   I've NOT been able to stop thinking about this place since. GONNA BE BACK THERE SOON."}
{"text":"This was my second time coming to this location and I will only give it a 4 star mainly because it's the closest thing we have to 'boiling crab' on the west side. The first time the food was REALLY good, the spice was on point and the shrimp was great. However the crawfish was super small the first time but I think they weren't really in season yet. Kind of wish they warned us about how small they were...this time or most time now I just order the shrimp. I was disappointed today because although the shrimp meat was really good the sauce tasted watered down. Seems like the flavor is usually a hit or miss thing even with their Tempe location so that's unfortunate, would be happier if their flavors were more consistent. Also there seemed to be a lot of bugs flying around us today which was a little annoying but the service was great and everyone kept checking on us which is always nice."}
{"text":"Not Quite What I Hoped For  I headed for \"Hot n Juicy\" in Tempe with pretty high expectations the other evening. I probably should have tempered my anticipation a bit. First of all, this isn't a place to go for the ambiance, not that ambiance was all that high on my list. That said, I got over it and settled down to order.   My server was friendly, attentive, very courteous, and appeared to know quite a bit about the food and various preparations, but her explanations didn't really guide me to ordering what I really wanted. I ended up ordering a pound of shrimp, and had the Louisiana Style seasoning in mind, but my server made that sound like dish water so I went with the Hot N Juicy Special seasoning that she guided me to, at the medium heat setting. I was going to order 1 piece of corn and 1 potato, but she made each sound as it they were tiny, so I ordered 2 corn and 3 potatoes. Being accustomed to boils in New Orleans, I threw in an order of sausage as well.  My food came out promptly all sauced up in its plastic bag, as anticipated. I tied on my bib, pulled on the plastic gloves to preserve my manicure, and started in.   Having read a review by someone who indicated that he didn't like to fight with his food to get it out of the shell, I anticipated a bit of work, and a good bit of messiness. Being pretty used to peeling shrimp, I was prepared for a bit of effort - but this was pretty extreme. For some reason, the shells appeared to be bonded to the shrimp pretty firmly, and getting shells and legs off of the shrimp was rough, time consuming work. I took off the gloves, thinking they were the problem, but, no - that made no difference. Enough about that,  What I was most disappointed with was the seasoning. It was rather thick and pasty, so that on the corn and potatoes, it just sort of sat on top. The shrimp fared a bit better for flavor than the veggies, but again, it was mostly surface flavor. The sausage was similar with respect to the impact of the seasoning, but was also very salty - so I pretty quickly just left it alone. The Hot N Juicy Special seasoning was just ok, medium was just right for me, with a bit of bite, but the seasoning profile was nothing like what I was accustomed to either in New Orleans, or on the east coast where I grew up in Baltimore with wonderfully seasoned boiled shrimp. I don't have any desire to ever try that seasoning again.   The potatoes and corn were about twice the size that my server described, so I had way more food than I wanted or anticipated. To the restaurant's credit, the corn, potatoes and sausage were all reasonably priced, so I didn't feel that I had been unreasonably up-sold.   After 6 shrimp, I got fed up with the peeling process, and eating as slowly as I was (so much time peeling in between bites) I found myself fairly full and gave up on eating any more. I still had more than half of my food remaining, although I'm not really a big eater anyway. My server helped me wrap up what was left, promptly brought me my check, and I headed home.  Considering my experience, I'm going to try Hot n Juicy a few more times. Once, to try the Louisiana Style seasoning, or the Juicy Cajun which hopefully will be a different experience. I'll ask more clarifying questions, and not rely on the server's preference or recommendation. I may even ask to try them both before deciding, since it is an investment that affects the entire meal. I'm also curious whether the shrimp peeling dilemma was related to the pastiness of the seasoning I chose. I will also return another time or two to try the Soft Shell Crab Basket, the Calamari, and the Blue Crab (if I find a seasoning that I like).   All things considered, I had an average experience that didn't destroy my overall interest, and the service really was fast and friendly. I hope to have a better review after my next visit."}
{"text":"ate here yesterday with the hubby. place wasn't packed which was good for us. i saw some tables needed cleaning. so the waiter asked us to have a seat while he cleaned a table for us. we waited for like maybe 10 mins thinking he forgot about us or maybe he decided to clean ALL the tables before seating us? a waitress walked by and the hubby said something. she was apologetic n sat us right away. she took our order right away. we ordered 4 lbs of the hot & juicy special crawfish. came out right away, looked and smelled good! the crawfish were  big but you can tell some of them were dead before being cooked.  we had to ask for bibs and i noticed so did a few other people. so i duno if it's given upon request or what. i thought it was nice that they had gloves available upon request for the non messy eaters. the crawfish was just ok. i ordered medium and it was SPICY!!! and too garlicky for me. it was hard to get past the very spicy n garlicky taste to be able to taste any other flavors. they checked on us a couple of times which was nice. but at the end when we wanted to check out no one  paid  attention and we were just sitting  waiting. i saw a few other tables waving their hands trying to get someone's attention. finally i said the heck with this i got up n when to the cashier and paid for my food. i don't care to come back here. but if i'm in vegas again and am dying for a crawfish fix maybe just maybe i'll come back. hopefully the service will have improved!!"}
{"text":"I'm never going to Joe's Crabshack again. This place has amazing food and even better service. Emeli made sure that it was an excellent experience all around."}
{"text":"The food was mediocre. The crawfish was frozen and over cooked. The fish was really fishy. Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"Great place to eat. Doesn't look that impressive from outside but nice inside.                     This place is just different from the places that I've been in. Very good crab legs spicy garlic awesome food the corn is the best ..            Recommend to everybody."}
{"text":"Good service with well seasoned seafood except for the taste less oysters that I don't recommend to anyone who loves oysters."}
{"text":"I don't normally write reviews here (mostly do to sloth, I imagine) but I do use yelp constantly to find the best places to check out in my city and the places I'm visiting.  After reading other yelpers complaints about the service, wait, etc. at Hot N' Juicy, I felt compelled to disagree after eating here a couple of weeks ago.   When the bf and I arrived for dinner the place was packed (always a good sign as I learned in San Francisco) but we were seated fairly quickly considering.  I'm usually a fan of a more refined dining experience but I found the no-frills, bid and paper towel decor very utilitarian.  All of the staff we encountered were great, especially our server (I think her name was Shawna) who was wonderfully sweet and helpful.  She made the awesome recommendation of the Hot N' Juicy sauce (spicy cause that's the way I like it) and gave us invaluable pointers on how exactly to attack the 3lbs of crawfish, crab and shrimp (\"you gotta suck the head!\").    Other than the awesome crustaceans the best part of our meal was finding out they're opening an San Francisco location.  If the SF outpost has the same great quality food and servers like ours you can bet we'll be regulars!"}
{"text":"I eat hot n juicy as much as I can, it's the best. Thanks Diane for helping me with the little things in my order, I appreciate when a server knows the little quirks to make a customer happy."}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying that I will be forever loyal to Cajun Corner on Brookhurst.   However, anytime I'm craving some cajun in Vegas, this would definitely be the place I would go to.    I came by with my parents when we were visiting Vegas over winter break cause my dad is a seafood fanatic and loves any form of seafood.  We started with some oysters which were shucked off the shell and came with plenty of lemon and Tabasco on the side.  We also had the hot n juicy shrimp with extra garlic which was fantastic, but not as spicy as I'm used to from Cajun Corner.    The crawfish was also well seasoned and had a bit more meat than I expected which was a big bonus.    My dad had the softshell crab which came with cajun fries although there wasn't that much cajun seasoning on them which was a bit disappointing because the seasoning was deliciously spicy and salty.  The corn was alright, only because it somehow didn't soak up the juice as it does at Cajun Corner (maybe I'm just biased)  The reason that I'm willing to give this place five stars despite a few minor preference issues is that the wait staff is great.  The waitress who took our order was fantastic, very nice and somehow managed to memorize all of the things that we ordered with modifications and had it all come out correctly.  That was impressive enough in my book considering that our ordered included different levels of spice, amounts of garlic and there was just a bunch of stuff to memorize.    I will definitely be back when the craving for cajun in Vegas strikes"}
{"text":"Good place for crawfish when it is im season. close to the strip...a little pricey thats why 3 stars"}
{"text":"Not as good as the competition.  Service was great but the sauce just wasn't as good as TBC.  I had the Snow Crab in the Hot n Juicy Baby Spice.  There wasn't much sauce for dipping which is what I do :)  It was just okay for me.  Parking is a pain in the booty on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"We had a less than stellar experience here.  We ordered a pound of shrimp and a pound of crawfish to share between my wife and I, which would have come to about $23 at current market price.  When the waiter dropped off my bag it seemed unusually beefy, and when he returned with the wife's shrimp, it too seemed large.  I asked him if these were one pound bags and he replied, \"No, two pounds each.\".  I told him we didn't order 2 pounds of each, just one, and he basically just shrugged his shoulders at us as if to say, \"Oh well, you've got em now.\" and walked away.  I had to get up and go track him down to explain to him that I did not want that much food and did not want to spend $50 on lunch and that he needed to figure out another option.  He came back to our table and picked up our food, then returned with the proper amounts.  The food itself was OK, not great as other reviews state.  Crawfish seemed on the tiny side, and many of the shrimp were a bit overcooked and mushy.  Flavor was tasty though, we had the mild Hot N Juicy seasoning.  This place wasn't worth the drive from the hotel for us, but maybe we just caught them on a bad day.  I would say this place is worth a shot, but I really can't recommend it based on my one and only visit."}
{"text":"The food was good but not great. I'm basing this off of my experiences with a place in the DC area called Chasin Tails which is a 6 out of 5 stars.  I would highly recommend that they provide a bucket when Yorker crabs or shrimp as it's super messy. I thought it was just me but noticed the same with everyone else  The sauce has a good flavor and there are many variations however it doesn't have that \"fresh taste\" it's more like a pre-made sauce that's added to the broil/bag.  They don't include corn or potatoes with your order, it's all a la carte. I think they should at least have one of each included.  Service was ok however it was pretty slow even though it wasn't full.  Would I go back? Yes but I would ask for less sauce in the bag.  TIP: Do NOT let that sauce go all over your fingers unless you wanna smell like you have a job peeling garlic all day."}
{"text":"Soooooo good spicy king crap legs were delicious and the shrimps are to die for , I'll be back for sure :)"}
{"text":"This location is better for larger groups compared to the other one on Spring Mountain. I personally like Hot n Juicy better than Boiling Crab. Their special sauce tastes more garlicky and savory to me. Be warned that they make things SPICY, just the way I like it! If you can't handle too much spice, ask for the baby spice level. Their mild is already a 5-6 on a 10 point scale. I usually order the Cajun fries, corn or rice to soak up that delicious sauce. Consider saving this for the end of your trip. I know you're clubbing tonight and hot garlic breath for days is not going to help your game."}
{"text":"Love this place! Its never a let down. I usually order the 1lb of shrimp (snow crab or alaskan king crab legs) with HnJ special sauce, medium spice with corn and a bowl of rice. You have to eat the corn last. Gotta let that corn soak in all the buttery, garlicky, spicy goodness. I also scoop some of the sauce onto my rice! Then down it with a nice cold Corona w/lime! Hits the spot!   I've tried Boiling Crab. Their sauces aren't bad but it doesn't do it for me. I love HnJ's sauce better."}
{"text":"Great cajun food! The food is served in bags with your choice of different seasonings. It's a messy and fun way to enjoy your meal. The prices are fair and I'd recommend this place to anyone who loves shrimp, mussels, crab and crawfish."}
{"text":"I had a great dinner experience here at hot n juicy . CEASER was my server and he was so sweet and kind very welcoming I'm definitely coming back and asking for ceaser ! Thanks hot n juicy"}
{"text":"Amazing place. Staff is very friendly. Me and my friends first time Going waiter helped us decide and we weren't disappointed"}
{"text":"I saw the Man vs Food episode featuring this restaurant and had to try it out.  After reading a few Yelp reviews, we ordered a pound each of shrimp and crawfish.  I'm so glad that we did.  Though the crawfish was very good, there was so little meat.  Enter the shrimp, here you get an entire mouthful of sweet flesh for the same effort.  I really liked the special sauce or whatever, but did wish that it saturated the crustaceans better.  We also ordered the etoufee...not a tomato based etoufee, but very good.  It's completely mixed in with the rice so it was almost like a gumbo.  The sweet potato fry were crispy.    All in all, we are very happy with the food.  The next time, we will order more shrimp...so delish.  O, and instead of mild, we'll go all the way."}
{"text":"Saw this place on Man vs Food and had to try it.  It was great!  Crawfish and shrimp were excellent and the Cajun Fries were terrific too!  Service great also."}
{"text":"Honestly I must say I went for my bday I had some girl with curly hair and glasses she was so rude who serviced us for my birthday it was a party of 11 we asked questions and very sarcastic I really felt like this would be good ok day of bday but I regret it seeing the fact how rude she was and talked to us and she ain't serve us good other than that I hope next time I enjoy it with other ppl besides her"}
{"text":"After the Man vs. Food special at Hot N Juicy how can one not visit this place while in Vegas. Its location is in Chinatown if you are visiting and staying on the strip, but the cab ride is well worth the money to try these succulent crawfish.  Wait time to be seated was expected for a restaurant seen on Man vs. Food, so don't be surprised. The hostess may even tell you to try their other restaurant down the street with \"no wait time,\" but we of course wanted the real deal. When we were finally seated, service wasn't bad at all for a busy Tuesday night, food came out consistently as we ordered. Which brings me to...THE FOOD!  I suggest tightening that bib across your neck because once that food comes out, get ready to lick those juices around your fingers slowly running down the side of your hands because it's going to get a bit messy!  Sweet potato fries: The perfect balance between sweet and salty. Fries came in a basket and had the right amount of juicy flavor, not dry but not drenched in oil either. A great way to start the beginning of the feast.  3 lbs of Hot N Juicy Special Crawfish and 1 lb of Shrimp: Better than expected! Crawfish come steamed in a bag drenched in their special sauce. Full of flavor and deliciousness! The heads don't come with too much juice, but crawfish meat come exceptionally hefty, as do the shrimp. I actually prefer their seafood drenched in so much flavor than the fire burning crawfish we had at New Orleans! Spice isn't too overwhelming... I think we got the medium. Get the potato and corn as they are steamed in with the crawfish too!   Well worth the trip and money! We had a great time getting down and dirty with these crawfish and shrimp. I don't think I'll ever find the perfect blend of spice and flavor! This place is a definite must when visiting Vegas!!"}
{"text":"maybe its unfair because in compairing this place to boiling crab in so cal.. but this place wasn't good at all.."}
{"text":"When I goto Vegas for work the first place I also go first is Hot & Juicy Crawfish!! The Original sauce is the best, I usually have crab, shrimp and crawfish. Don't forget to add the incredible sausage and corn. The food is very messy and fun. Expect to taste  and smell garlic for the next 24 hours!!"}
{"text":"Damn good crawfish and shrimp.  Loved the seasonings and the casual atmosphere.  Not far off the strip and great prices.  We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Went to this awesome place with my daughter and was served by the most amazing customer service giving guy named RICH...he was amazing and took great care of us. I will now come and ask for him because he knows the value of giving great customer service and made sure our visit was amazing. Written by a highly satisfied customer...RICH you rock keep up the great attitude!!!"}
{"text":"It was once upon when I visited the other Hot n' Juicy location on Spring Mountain and Decatur. If my memory serves me right I had no complaints with the food, the service was fine, and the concept of eating shellfish out of a bag was kind of cool. One thing that I remember vividly of the time was the shower I took that night I ate the meal and how much my hair smelled like garlic and how my clothes were marinated with the smell of the restaurant. Although the food and experience was mediocre, I felt like all the work to get rid of the stench was too much.  Like I said, though, that was once upon a time. The other night, I was in the mood to eat some shrimp; some really spicy shrimp. I was out in the Henderson area visiting the in-laws and I searched Yelp for Hot n' Juicy with the intention of visiting the same location I had gone long ago, knowing full well that I should to gear up for the occasion and what would be required after. To my surprise, however, a location that was much closer to where I was popped up in the GUI and I decided to try it out.  What a great decision! This location has recently opened up I have learned. The inside of the place looks modern and contemporary, they have nice big booths for dining and quite a bit of seating. We arrived right around 8:30 to 9:00 pm and there was about a 15 minute wait, which I was expecting for a Sunday night. There was plenty of open seating at the bar where I would have sat had my wife and I not brought our little niece along to enjoy the experience. There were 3 to 4 flat-screen TV's on each wall meaning if you every wanted to eat spicy seafood while you catch a game, there wouldn't be a bad seat in the house.   Part of the experience was identical to that of the other location on Spring Mountain and Decatur; the tables are wrapped in plastic for you to discard the shells of the fish, gloves are given upon request, no lids for the drinks (although, you may be able to request one), and a little plastic bib to remind you that you hardly need to be careful while you eat.  Another part of the experience, which I thoroughly enjoyed, that I couldn't recall (or perhaps didn't exist) from my previous visit to the other location; there was a nice ventilation system in this place. The air was only mildly filled with the flavorful aromas simmering from their savory sauces.  Ok, now the reason I really wanted to write this review: THE FOOD. I got was I was coming for; I got my shrimp. However, I don't remember the food being this good! I ordered two pounds of shrimp. In one bag we went with the Louisiana sauce \"spicy\" and in the other we got the\"Hot n' Juicy special sauce \"spicy\". Although they were both good, the house sauce was exceptionally good. I found myself dipping the Louisiana flavored shrimp in the remnants of what was once a pound of of Hot n' Juicy Special flavored shrimp. I probably looked like a rabid dog while I sucking out whatever was contained in the heads of the shrimps just to enjoy every last drop of the sauce. I was going to the empty out the bag as a drink, but by that time my wife was already giving me the look that meant I needed to take it down a notch; so I complied.  I walked out of that place a happy man. I didn't smell like I spent a couple hours in a garlic-steamed sauna and I had just enjoyed some of the best tasting shrimp I had ever tasted. Needless to say, I'll be back, and most likely to this location."}
{"text":"Love it.  My friend and I had two pounds crawfish and a pound of shrimp plus corn on the cobs.  I was sweating like crazy.  It was very good.  We tried the Lemon Pepper and spicy hot mild on the crawfish.  The shrimp was medium spicy hot.    The staff were awesome too.  Very friendly atmosphere.  Thanks! We will be back!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. I'm here every 2-3 weeks. I'm not a crawfish eater but the shrimp is delicious. They never fail to serve it the way I like it, plain and not spicy! Service is quick, wait times on the weekends are crazy but so worth the wait! They recently opened another location so I'm sure wait time have decreased dramatically. I recommend visiting here if you love seafood, also great for first dates. :)"}
{"text":"I normally eat at the other location but parking there sucks and if you arent lucky enough to find a parking space you can drive the mile down the road to the new location there is plenty of space there.  Of course be prepared for horrible customer service. Outside of being sat right away we didnt see our servers but once every 30 mins and that was because we stood up and waved one down when our drinks were empty.  After our meal was done it was another 10 mins before our bill came and we had to ask for it twice.  This store is laid out better and you dont feel like you are sitting on top of the people next to you.  The food is still top notch. Gloriously spicy and delicious. Almost perfect...I say almost only because they dont serve something to cool you down afterwards. A simple soft serve ice cream machine with one or two flavors would make this a perfect dinning experience but 98.5% is good enough for me!"}
{"text":"I am pleased with the experience I had here. At this location I visited during lunch and the service was not memorable but the catfish was yummy. I never ventured away from the Crawfish, I am glad I did."}
{"text":"Way too messy.  Just not my thing.  And I know way too much about this type of cuisine to say give it a shot if you want the experience.    No.    They bring your food to you in bags.  No.  So okay, you don't go here to be healthy to begin with, but really?    And it is just so messy, everything was so messy and it really did not taste that good after all.    No."}
{"text":"I think I've been spoiled by the likes of boiling crab in OC and the other 4 cajun seafood restaurants..  With that said, The service here was great. He went through the menu and let us know what was available.   We had Medium, Hot and juicy  sauce 1 pound of crawfish and 4 pounds of shrimp, cajun fries and calamari.   Let's just say that no one should ever let me order food. The sauce was pretty good but we couldn't finish 4 pounds of shrimp so ..."}
{"text":"This is a recent discovery of mine.  It's hard to find a good place that only does seafood, and not just with the plain old butter. As many of stated, you will be expected to get your hands dirty at this place, however they do offer bibs and gloves if needed. And if seeing shrimp with their heads on scares you, then this is not the place for you.  I'm not a big crawfish fan, I just stick to my regular choice when I come here, Hot & Juicy style, Mild, 1 lb of shrimp with corn & sausage with a bowl of rice on the side. It comes to less than$15 total before tax & tips. It is cheap considering it's fresh and well-seasoned seafood!  The only down side I would say is the parking as many have mentioned here. I was lucky couple times and found a spot in their little strip mall parking lot. But other times I had to park in Church's Chicken lot because all the side streets were taken. And throughout dinner I was nervous that my car would get towed, but luckily it didn't. So my suggestion is carpool, go early if you can! Otherwise if you have a big party and go later, be expected to wait at least 30~45 min at least."}
{"text":"Yummy!!!! My boyfriend and I shared the crawfish, and shrimp sampler. The shrimp were really good but the crawfish was ok. It was plenty to share.  It also came with potatoes, corn and sausages.  It was nicely seasoned and the staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"First timer and wow!! Great outcome. Service was fast..let's not forget to give a shout out to the girls, they are amazing!! Amanda thank you for putting my bib on for me."}
{"text":"this place is GREAT!   If you're looking for a stylish and fancy place, this is not for you. There is no glamour in pealing and cracking crabs, or looking like you're about to perform surgery (due to gloves and bibs). However, everything tastes amazing and because intensive product rotation, I do believe everything is very fresh.   Crawfish is overrated, thou. It is hard to crack and you get a small amount of meat.  I always order shrimp and king crab, both with Hot N juicy sauce (extra spicy!). Do not miss sides of corn and potatoes.   This place is fun and delicious. Best of its kind."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Food was tasty and services was awesome especially MAX. Great experience."}
{"text":"Wow....I am an addict of H&J now.  To be honest I didn't think H&J would be better than Boiling Crab but holy moly it sure was way better.  Less oily but still very buttery delicious and flavorful! Thank you"}
{"text":"My friend got a bad batch of oysters and became ill about 20 min after eating them. the service was really disorganized but I understand they're still new and getting new servers trained but we had several servers come try to explain the menu and multiple people constantly stopping by to ask if everything was ok. it got a little annoying but whatever. my friend didn't get sausage in her bag and one of the servers acted as if we were lying about it saying \"I saw sausage in your bag, it's in there, let me check again\". sir... I'm looking in the effing bag and there is no freakin sausage. I ordered a pound of mussels and they were tiny! but their Cajun fries were pretty bomb, crispy and really well seasoned and the seasoning was spicy and had a nice kick! overall, nice place but I prefer Angry Crab in Mesa."}
{"text":"Ill try to write about this place as short as i can..  I got there and was actually taking the food to go.  I ordered 3 pounds of crawfish hot and juicy style mild medium and spicy as well as 2 pounds of shrimp garlic butter seasoning.  All i can say is everything had a good kick of a flavor.  The restaurant aroma was lingering in the air as soon i stepped inside.  All the garlic burned my eyes with passion :).. Okay so we got the food home as soon as possible to try and taste it.  So i tore open the bags and noticed that there were about 4-5 large crawfish  and rest were pretty petite.  By the way there were 3 of us and we finished the shrimp as well as two bags of the crawfish.  The  taste was great as i expected.  I would definitely return for more when i am in town."}
{"text":"I was at hot n juicy in Florida and was impressed with that one. And since I'm here visiting my in-laws and they were craving seafood, we decided to go here.  Let me tell you - I WILL NEVER GO HERE AGAIN. SERIOUSLY. I'd rather take them on a bit of drive to the Angry Crab shack in Peoria. Their food has higher quality AND I'm more than willing to pay the price for that quality. Here? Pft, I'm paying for stomach ache!   As soon as I started peeling the crawfish, the meat inside the shell just fell apart. I stopped eating the crawfish after my first one and just ate the shrimp instead. I'm actually lucky that I got away with mild nausea whereas my hubby got a stomach upset about 20min after that meal.   We ordered 2lb of shrimp, 2 of clams and 2 of crawfish - 1.5lb of clams were all shells. The meat fell out somewhere in cooking process. The crawfish must've been frozen for a while already before it even got cooked. AND not to mention that all of us were still hungry after paying for all that food. It was just pathetic and NOT WORTH IT. Go to Angry Crab instead if you can drive a bit further."}
{"text":"I'm a BIG crawfish fan back at home in Norcal, so coming here I was ready to try Vegas crawfish. I came with a party of 14 and surprisingly got seated right away. Service was kind of slow, we literally had to flag down the waitress to ask for gloves and more lemons. Then when the bill came out there was a minor mix-up. Anyways the crawfish tastes a lot like Boiling Crab except with a more lemongrass flavor to it. Not bad at all. I deducted 1 star for the dozen raw (and runny) oysters we ordered that tasted gross and not fresh at all. So when you order try to stick to crawfish or else u would get a nasty old oyster taste in your mouth. The shrimp was meaty and juicy just perfectly done. We boxed our leftovers to bring back to our hotel and it still tastes great after we microwave it. Definitely a win!"}
{"text":"Fun & messy! It's fun to sit around with your friend working for each tiny bite of crawfish meat. My favorites are the black mussels and shrimp because the meat is easier to get to."}
{"text":"We're visiting from out of town, stumbled across this place via Yelp. Loved it! Similar place in San Diego with the same kind of peel and eat using your hands. Fabulous service, great food, good prices"}
{"text":"I love the hot n juicy sauce from this place. It makes everything so much better. Spice level is not as hot as advertised. At least not for me.   The shrimp was good. Clams and king crab legs were excellent. No wait either on a Friday night at 7pm, which was the best part."}
{"text":"5/5 customer service  5/5 food quality  Finally got to try it and it wasn't a mistake at all. Same concept applies as Boiling Crab, you choose what kind of seafood you want, any extras inside the bag (potatoes, corn, sausage etc.,) and then your seasoning and spice levels.  I got: 1lb shrimp Flavor: Hot N Juicy  Spice: Baby spice  My boyfriend got: 1/2 shrimp w/ 1 lb sausage  Flavor: Hot N Juicy  Spice: EXTRA SPICY (TBC XXX is spicer)  It felt like love at first bite, I loved the sweetness of the sauce. It goes great with rice and lemon with salt and paper. They also offer many selections on fried food items/appetizers, I wish I got the chance to try them but there's always next time. They do offer gloves, which is nice and makes eating more convenient and comfortable.  The only reason why I'm giving it a four star is due to cleanliness. The girls bathroom needs a little attention, the paper towel dispenser wasn't working, there was trash everywhere. It was just harder to clean up after yourself, especially after a dirty meal but other than that everything was great."}
{"text":"The corn fritters were amazing. The sauce for the snow crab legs I got was also amazing, this is the only place that can stand up to Down and Dirty Seafood in Albuquerque for Cajun boil style seafood in my opinion (since I've never been to Cajun country)."}
{"text":"$15/lb shrimp $14/lb crawfish $11 calamari  $0.75/corn  They weren't so busy the night of cinco de mayo so we decided to stop by. I was craving calamari and boy did that hit the spot. They have marinara sauce (thank goodness). I got a half pound of shrimp, lemon pepper, baby spice with a corn added and a side of rice. My boyfriend got a pound of crawfish, hot n juicy, medium with two corns on the side, one plain and one in the sauce.   Their service was great and they always checked up on us. They gave you a bib and gloves once you sit down. They had specials that night, $2 coronas and $5 margaritas which were definitely worth it! I like the location since it's on the strip and open late.  If ever you're near Planet Hollywood and looking for that shrimp or crawfish fix, hot n juicy is the way to go!  They allow outside drinks. *two thumbs up*"}
{"text":"I was really hoping this place was going to be as good as on the reviews but I have to say this is the worst place I've ever had crawfish at. Maybe it's because I'm just use to the flavors in Houston?...probably not because I've had good crawfish in San Diego and New Orleans. So maybe I just don't like the taste of frozen crawfish? My crawfish tasted like it was over-cooked and lacked salt. Even though I got their most popular flavor 'hot n juicy' and my fiancé got their 'garlic butter' our crawfish tasted exactly the same. I had to send it back. I'm pretty disappointed because I really wanted to like this place. If they wouldn't have taken the crawfish off my bill, I would have given them a 1 star (so thanks Hot N Juicy).   Other than the crawfish, I think the rest of the food is good. My friend got the snow crab and she said it was good, and her Cajun fries (although received after she was practically done with her meal) were good too."}
{"text":"H-N-J was good but not the best bag seafood that I've had....    We came on a Sunday with a hungry party of 5. No, line and we were instantly greeted and seated.   Like the real rocket scientists that we are, we ordered a large sample of the menu:  2lbs Snow Crab 2lbs King Crab 3lbs Shrimp 2lbs Craw-fish  The seafood was quality; no complaints on the size or freshness of our feed. My beef is with the seasoning. I've been to many a boil bag seafood places and was blown away by the taste. Yes, there was alot of sauce but for some reason none of it stuck with the meat?!? Once the seafood was extracted, shucked, cracked, peeled or decapitated, there was not much taste left?!?  Maybe they didn't let our stuff soak long enough in the bag? I know that it's possible because I've eaten at other places and the sauce penetrated (hehe) the shells and soaked into the meat. So yah it was a bit of a disappointment for me.   Questions: Why do they only serve corn and potato with the crawfish? (notice the singulars) I wish that they offered it with all of their bags. When we drop $200 + on a seafood feast, that's the last that can can do. How do you decide who get the one potato or corn among 5 people? Don't nickel and dime us when we are spending mad money here.   Why do they not have mixed bags? I think it's a bummer if you want to sample everything and didn't bring a large enough party.  Maybe we will try the one across the street to compare. Maybe...  Sorry fellow Vegas Elites I must go against the grain on this one...   Up to you but Pat no approve..."}
{"text":"Okay, today is 3/20/18 Me and my family had a Bday get together  At this place I have two kids 3-5 years old  First off the furniture of this place is faulty!! Chairs we're falling apart... god forbid an elderly  Sits on a chair there.... smdh !  Not only that they took them away and gave the chairs to someone else totally didn't give a shit... Then ! Upon ordering we asked the waitress to recommend something for the kids, Because my kids don't like spicy food.. She recommended the baby spice so we ordered the drool since it came with crab legs, shrimp, crawfish. When it finally arrived the bag was tied too tightly to tear open! Totally spilled my drink upon opening the bag! kids started crying it was too SPICY!! On top of that cause that's 50$ bag that includes snow crab we found ONE single leg !!!!! Smdh!!!  We ended up ordering 2 additional chicken tender meals for the kids that TOOK 35-40 To make ! The kids we're SUPER HUNGRY!!! It's was hot mess!!!  The overall service was HORRIBLE!!!! I recommend boiling crab DONT even waste your time at this shitty place!!! NEVER AGAIN!!!!! Totally wasn't worth the money!!!! I give it 0 STARS!!!!"}
{"text":"10 dollars for a pound of cooked shrimp or crawfish?  It's a good deal.  Get the combo flavor, it's their most popular and for a reason.  Lots of butter and herbs and spices.  Their food is spicy so order their mild which is actually medium.  The crawfish wasn't interesting after the first one. They look like aliens and you can see their prominent lungs after you take off the shell attached to the head. The tail meat is about the size of my thumb's nail.  Don't try breaking open the claw, it's hard to do and the meat is so insubstantial that it's simply not worth the time to get to it.   I don't recommend the crawfish unless you are patient and on a diet.  It would have helped if shell crackers were available for the crawfish.  The shrimp is much more interesting and worthwhile, you can really taste the lovely butter mix when you eat their little arms.  However, don't suck out the heads because the heads taste very bitter!  They don't devein the shrimp so expect to eat shrimp poop.    The whole eating process is amazingly messy (the name Hot N Juicy is appropriate) and expect to stay for about an hour at least to take off the shells of each small creature.  This is definitely not the place for a date unless you find butter and shrimp poop sexy.  Definitely order the corn, it absorbs the butter and spices beautifully.   This is a place to enjoy a messy but delicious meal. I recommend their shrimp.  Service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Great experience, the service was excellent, especially Michael. It's a little strange with all the plastic table cloths, food bags, and bibs. When the restroom ran out of soap and was a little nasty, they jumped on the cleaning. I really like the responsiveness of the staff.   Now for the food, we had Alaskan King Crab($27/lb) with garlic and butter, Snow Crab($18/lb) hot and spicy style, fried shrimp with Cajun fries, and corn fritters. Everything was good. The spicy version of hot and spicy was enough to numb my lips for the first 5 minutes. Burn baby burn! We needed a few beers to quell the fires in our mouths. Don't expect fine dining. The atmosphere is extremely casual with dance/club music playing throughout, basic bench and wood chair seating, aluminum siding accents, TVs spaced out on the walls, and tank top clad young ladies and t-shirt wearing men serving the tasty food in plastic bags.   So, this is not a first date place, wouldn't be very impressive to a potential mate. But for the family, friends, or long-time mate, it's fun. Ask for the mild versions and work up to the heat ladder. I can handle straight Thai peppers and fresh Serranos. So believe me when I say they can make it hot."}
{"text":"Came here for a UYE that Teri W had put together!  So off the bat, we were a larger group.  Some insight for larger groups, they will divide the check into 3 different checks.  Were were not told this in the beginning so our server was kind enough to split the checks for each party.  Also they auto grat larger parties so watch out for that as it usually not mentioned.  This was the first time dining at a place like HnJ.  There were no prices on the menu for the main courses but they were posted at the register and different places around the restaurant.  I would think a daily printing of the menu with the prices would alleviate squinting to see the price posted across the way and table mates not thinking that your staring at them when your actually reading the menu.  :)  Our server suggested that if it was your first time here to order spice level that is one level lower than you are normal used too!  I myself am a medium level gal all around and decided to just go for it!  I ordered the snow crab legs, medium spice with butter and garlic. After putting on a bib and choosing to dig in with bare hands, the fun begins!  Plastic gloves are available if you choose not to get dirty!  The crab legs were good.  They were fresh! and fun to eat!    I would come back here another time to check out other options!  Give them a try and decide for yourself!"}
{"text":"I told one of my coworkers about a new business that is having a grand opening today, and to meet us there after work.  I didn't know the exact address, so I told him to just search for the Hot N Juicy by name and go to the one closest to the Wynn.  He immediately thought I was trying to steer him to some other type of establishments hidden in plain sight throughout Las Vegas.  At Hot N Juicy, where the girls on average are pretty, the service is very friendly and attentive, Hot n Juicy Special is always on the menu, individual experiences can be customized from Mild to Extra Spicy, you can definitely treat your mouth to a messy but happy ending.  And today only, you can enjoy it with a 2-for-1 special*.  Come early and expect to wait at least 40 minutes, or take up the offer of a free limo shuttle service to Hot n Juicy (original location) where the food is the same, but without the wait and the services of the Hot N Juicy All-Star waitresses.  Again, the limo is presumably for the Grand Opening promotion only.  Spicy level is supposedly a little higher than other places, so customize accordingly.  1 pound of crawfish may sound like a lot, but it really is not, as most of the weight is contributed by the lobster-mini-me shells.  If crawfish is not your thing, shrimp, lobster, clams, and various crabs (Dungeness, Blue, Snow and King), and raw oysters can be ordered.  You can add the following sides to your above orders: Corn, potato, sausage, Cajun fries, sweet potato fries, bowl of rice, rolls and even extra seasoning sauce.  Appetizers include Fried Shrimp, Fried Catfish, Soft Shell Crab, Calamari, Chicken Wings and Etouffee.  What I like about this place?  \"It is bigger on the inside\".  The waitresses remind me of Suicide Girls.  Perfect place to visit to satisfy your spicy food craving. In case there is a wait for the use of the restrooms or you have a tendency to stare at the waitresses, you have portraits of the lovely Hot N Juicy Girls to check out.  Or you can just pretend there is a line for the lavatory.  What I don't like or care for:  Shrimp are not de-veined.  The parking here can be a pain, as it can be rather scarce during peak hours.  Not to mention some less than proficient drivers to deal with.  Overall, I enjoyed my Hot N Juicy dining experience.  The food was pretty good, but dining here is more of a social activity for me. And if you have a problem with eating with your hands and getting messy, it is best to patronize a different establishment, otherwise enjoy!  Ambiance:  4/5  Roomy, with fishing theme decor adorning the walls and pictures of the Hot N Juicy waitresses on the hallway wall leading to the restrooms. Cleanliness:  5/5  It is new, but I hope they keep it looking that way. Food:  4/5  Nothing extraordinary, but it is enjoyable and fun. Price: 3/5  About what you expect.  The main items are all priced at \"Market or Seasonal Price\", which for shrimp and crawfish are around the $10 mark. Location:  4/5  Definitely close enough to the Strip for the out-of-towners to take a cab here.  Pretty solid 4 Yelp stars.  *Buy 1 pound of crawfish get the 2nd pound free, all day until it is sold out."}
{"text":"Had a good impression on Enrique, a very nice handsome guy we never feel like abandoned even sitting at tables outside."}
{"text":"I was here on April 11, just happen to spot it from a bridge and let me tell you the way the served the food was different. The flavor was very good. Just to think you can find something in Las Vegas strip. A must go."}
{"text":"I have heard good things about this place for a while and have driven past both locations pretty often. However, I have never REALLY wanted to try Hot N Juicy Crawfish because I am kind of like a cat, LOL. I don't like messy eating and if I am going to go out and pay for my food, I prefer all the work to be done for me, if you know what I mean.   The in-laws were in town and have been wanting to eat here, so we finally came here for dinner the other night. We arrived at just the right time because there were a few tables still open and we were seated right away. 10 minutes later, the restaurant was full and many people were waiting outside. We had no luck with parking. The parking lot is very small and we had to park across the street.   My husband and the in-laws ordered a variety of seafood: blue crab, clams, shrimp crawfish, and catfish.   Their opinions: - the shrimp and catfish were the best - the crawfish required too much work for too little meat - the crab was very hard to take apart - \"mild\" was still pretty spicy  I ordered the fried shrimp and sweet potato fries. I know, boring right? The fried shrimp wasn't very good. I think that the size was decent, but there was just too much breading on them. After eating 2 pieces, I didn't want anymore. The sweet potato fries were standard, nothing special.   I'm glad I tried it, but I don't think I would come back again because I didn't enjoy it too much. However, I will give this place 4 starts because my family thought it was alright and had a good time. Service was friendly and attentive. We even had nice neighbors who showed us what they had ordered and commented on what tasted good.  Just a few tips: - DO NOT wear nice clothing because juices will squirt everywhere and you will get dirty! -Remember to take a shower and do laundry ASAP because you will smell like the restaurant even after you leave! Skin, hair, clothes, everything!"}
{"text":"To me I thought Hot N Juicy was just like boiling Crab, Everything tasted the same except I thought their Fried Shrimp Basket was delicious. It seems like they fried their shirmp in corn meal which gave it a tasty bite and crunch. I think that was the only difference and you don't have to wait an 1 1/2 hour in line like Boiling Crab in Garden Grove. Prices I think are a little more expensive but hey they got to ship everything to Vegas... I would come back esp. for the Fried Shrimp."}
{"text":"All I have to say is: It's about...damnnn time! My friends and I always, always make a stop here when we visit Las Vegas.  But to finally open here is pretty much a dream come true.    They are the best in the business of crawfish and other cajun style seafood.  I can finally say there's a great place in town I can take visitors to if they never had Cajun food or even a seafood boil for that matter.  Let's start off by talking about their crawfish! They are consistently fresh.  They pretty much perfected their secret recipe to a science.  The temperature and sauce is spot on.  I love my seafood HOT and SAUCY.  The garlic and Cajun spices truly pack a punch.    If you are new to this, I highly suggest starting off with the crawfish since that is what they are known for.  If you just hate digging your nails into hard shells, then shrimp might be your next best option.  The beauty of eating this type of seafood is to taste the freshness from the sea.  I always, almost order 2lbs worth of crawfish.  Why? You get free corn, potato, and sausages fused with heavenly Cajun flavors.    A trick I love doing is to order a side of rice and making a poor man style gumbo.  As you are peeling your seafood, take the juices, like guts or brains from your seafood and dump it into you rice and let it build.  At the end, tear up some sausages and pour in your left over Cajun juice from your boil onto the rice.  Voila! Enjoy!  Since they just recently opened, now is probably a good time to get your crawfish fix before the word is out.  There is a bit of wait during dinner time.  First come first serve.  Don't worry its worth the wait.  I hope they will open more around the valley.  I will probably eat here atleast once a month."}
{"text":"Probably the best Crawfish joint in Southwest USA! Imported FRESH from Louisiana.  This place is the real deal.  The last time I was there, we happen to run into former Louisianians and had said they were just as good as they had them back home.  Be prepared to get messy.  You order by the pound.  They come in plastic bags and a tin bucket (for disposing shells)."}
{"text":"The Drool which is a bag o plenty filled with crawfish, crab legs , prawns, sausage, corn and potatoes could probably feed three people!  You also get an appetizer of fried calamari! Great place for friends, family and co workers.  In the heart of Chinatown Las Vegas.  Service was great non need to be proper eat with your hands like barbarian kings!  If you must use the shell cracker ok any other utensil is inexcusable!  Food Tate's great! You have the option of how spicy you wanted and if you wanted Cajun or regular!  Do not go there unless you have an empty stomach!  Plan on walking the strip afterwards to burn off the calories!"}
{"text":"It wouldn't be right if I don't call myself an addict after eating at this place 7 times since I moved to Vegas (that was 3 weeks ago) I was used to the Boiling Crab hype living in the Bay but this place...is just so much better! Now, I am aware of what I have been missing and it's Hot N Juicy. The name describes the glorious seafood available to be devoured with friends. I have also tried their original location up the street but this particular spot just speaks to me in volumes. The service is phenomenal and I never have to wave a server down for drink refills. This is definitely my go-to spot for crawfish cravings and with that being said...I will see you in an hour Hot N Juicy!"}
{"text":"The service was slow and our waitress was rude. We were a party of three and when we go there, the place wasn't even crowded, but it still took them nearly 40 minutes to seat us. Then when we were finally seated, our table was practically ignored. We had to actively flag the waitress down to get her attention, it was just awful. I don't think I'll ever eat at that establishment again."}
{"text":"i don't even know why i'm reviewing this. i feel like i can't do it justice because i'm not really crazy about this kind of food to begin with ... but out of an obligation to being a good yelp steward, here goes nothing.  no full bar. only beer and wine. of course, i can't even imagine drinking something else with a seafood boil so i guess that works. the seasoning is really good. i had the garlic butter something something skrrrrimp mild... and even mild was warm so be careful.  it's a super popular place so either go early or prepare to wait. after you order, utensils will arrive in the form of a bib and gloves. get crackin'. hope you enjoy seeing what your insect of the sea delight looked like shortly before its demise because it is fully intact.  they have a fried selection if that isn't your thing. ;-)"}
{"text":"If you don't mind getting messy and love seafood this is the spot to go! My friend goes every time he's in Vegas, so we came along this time. Awesome catfish, and the garlic butter shrimp was phenominal! The Cajun fries are great too! Definitely check this spot out!"}
{"text":"Great place to get your seafood fix. Friendly staff. I would definitely come back. Not too $$$. They sauce they had was amazing. Nice place to get your hands dirty!"}
{"text":"Solid place to go if you're craving a messy Louisiana boil. I'm so glad this location exists because it's relatively empty and close to home. If I'm ever craving shrimp or crawfish, I'd definitely come here instead of Boiling Crab or the other Chinatown location.  My go-to order: Cajun fries (kinda spicy), 1 lb. Medium Hot N Juicy Shrimp and a side of rice. I think it was about $12.99 per lb for shrimp. This definitely filled me up! Unfortunately, I still prefer Boiling Crab's Whole-Shabang, but for the location proximity and little to no wait, this place is definitely the next best alternative.  Delicious. Messy. Smelly. Garlic-y. Yup. This place has it all! Service was attentive throughout our visit and they were super friendly. My partner ordered crawfish too, which was tasty. They had a frozen crawfish or fresh option, which was interesting to see. When we went, I think it was about $7.99/lb for frozen and around $12.99/lb for live crawfish.  In total, we spent about $58 bucks including tip and tax for a party of 2. This was definitely expensive for a seafood craving, especially since we didn't even order crab or alcohol. No regrets. Ever."}
{"text":"Smelled great. But we waited 20 min to be seated. Then once seated  , we waited 25 mins for someone to come. No one ever came so we left.  Very disappointing"}
{"text":"We had to wait for about 45 mins which was reasonable since the place was packed. We ordered the black muscles, and get your feet wet .... I think that's what it was called. We opted for the Cajun spicy mild. The shrimp was a bit over cooked (not to the point that we sent it back) but everything else was really good."}
{"text":"Prepared to get messy but it's sooo worth it! They give you gloves a bib and wrap the table up in plastic so you can enjoy the seasoned bags of seafood. My favorite is the hot n juicy spice and if you're sensitive to spice definitely go with baby spice because even the mild has a major kick. I also always order a side of butter and extra lemons.   I usually order the snow crab legs and my husband loves the shrimp. This time I did it big and ordered a pound of the king crab legs and it was totally worth it, although it does cost significantly more. Even though I only got two king legs they were huge and there was probably way more meat in them than all of a portion of the smaller snow crab legs. I also highly recommend ordering the corn on the cob because it comes seasoned in the bag. If you're hungry order a side of fries because they're seasoned really well and you're more likely to leave feeling full."}
{"text":"First off, let me start by saying the Ladies who work at this particular Hot n Juicy are amazing!  Their service is above and beyond!  I went to this location on April 21st to order take-out.....and when I say take-out, I mean driving an hour back home!  I ordered 7lbs of the live crawfish, garlic butter baby spice, with the sauce on the side.  Since have to drive back home I always try to bring ice with me to quickly cool down the crawfish so it won't keep cooking in transit, then I reheat ut when I get home; but, that day my stop at H n J was on a whim (hey when you have a craving you must obey!).  The manager (I'm so sorry I forgot your name ) was kind enough to bag up some ice for me to put on top of the crawfish bags!!!  To top it off, she packed the order in a box, put the ice in, the picked up the box told me to open the door and she took the box out to the car for me!  You can't ask for better customer care than that!!!!!  Thank to the wonderful servers and manager at Hot n Juicy!  This is my new favorite location.  Oh and the food was amazing...trust me it reheat really well."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic... once they actually got everything that you ordered out on the table for you. I went here on a kinda busy Saturday night, and my party of 4 was sat in about half of the quoted wait time, so that was a plus. The experience started off well, the server was very friendly until we needed her and she was nowhere to be found. You definitely have to ask a few people for the things that you are missing to get them out, it took about 20 minutes to get melted butter to my table. My parents ordered chicken wings, and those came out before any other food, when they were brought out we realized that the inside of the wings was still cold by the bone. The server came and took them back to the kitchen to reheat, once they were brought back out they added a few more on for the hassle. Other than that the food was amazing like I said, the seasoning made everything so much tastier, but it is super spicy! We ordered a half pound of shrimp, a pound of snow crab, a pound of black mussels, and a pound of crawfish, with two potatoes and two pieces of corn. We got the crawfish out first, and waited a while for the rest to come, when it did we were missing a potato, but another server brought out an extra one for us. When it came time for the bill there were a few fishy things, I believe that we were charged for an extra drink, but I felt that I had already complained enough, and it would be my word against the servers anyway so I let it go. Then we asked the server to split the check, and an extra dollar was added on to each bill! Once again, I let it go it's only a dollar, maybe the server made an honest mistake. The server was still tipped well, regardless of the service quality because I work in the industry and understand that on busy nights it can be easy to forgot small things. That being said, I loved the food and the concept but I won't be back on a busy night. I will probably try hot n juicy again on a less busy day, or at a different location than the one on Mill Ave."}
{"text":"If you're a big seafood fan like me, you'll love this place.  I always order 1lb garlic shrimp, fried calamari and a cup of rice. Its delicious! The shrimp is a tad too spicy to me but the calamari actually balances it.   The pricing is a bit too much for me. 1lb shrimp for around $10 and the fried food is also around the $10 range.  Its very casual, dim and loud place. Go crazy with your food :)"}
{"text":"Amanda Amanda Amanda! I can see you are very popular from the other reviews.    First I didn't appreciate how you looked in the trash bucket after I told you about the 3 corn on the cob I never got, just to make sure I wasn't lying.  Second, I love how you kept reassuring about how my muscles just need to open up and it only took 50 minutes, I counted 12 empty muscles out of 16 and 4 of them fell out of their shell, did you get hungry along the way?  Last, all I asked was for you to check on my brownies and you immediately snapped back \"no\" without checking. Maybe it was the fact that I had a newborn baby and a child that had to go to school along with it being 10pm that I request for you to do me a simple favor.  I appreciated the management to compensate me $20 credit for the brownies taking 30 minutes. It still does not make up for Amanda's work ethic.  Also all the cash tip I left was for Daniela who was not my server but just the simple fact that she kept checking up on me was all that I requested."}
{"text":"Hostess was nice, waiter was stoned and acted tired, annoyed, and confused when we had questions, being it was our first time there. He said look at the menu everything is on there. Paid 60 for 4 crablegs, they tasted good, but they forgot to bring out half our order. They acted rude when we suggested they forgot half our order. Corn was good, king crab was great. Next time I will stick to blue crab, fried shrimp and crawfish for the value. Over all the food was over priced, tasted ok, but the service was terrible. The plastic bag thing was interesting, but it was loud with no music. Bathrooms were disgusting!"}
{"text":"This was my first time coming here and it was about what I had expected.  The food was nothing spectacular and the service was decent.  Our waitress could have been more attentive to us but I can cut her a little bit of slack because she had around 5 other tables with full parties that she had to watch over.    Specifically on the food, it seemed a bit over priced compared to other restaurants in town (Boiling Crab).  I personally didn't order any seafood as I just ordered a catfish basket and tried my friends' seafood, which had too much sauce in my opinion which was swimming at the bottom of the bag.  As far as the restaurant itself, it's odd to have it as an L-shaped restaurant as opposed to a more open area.  There were a few TV's tuned to sports but they weren't very loud.  Overall, it won't be my go-to spot for Cajon food, but at least now I know."}
{"text":"Hot N Juicy Crawfish Have been wanting to try this restaurant for some time.  Ordered the Catfish Basket with Fries, Soft Shell Crab Basket with sweet potato fries along with a bag filled shrimp, sausage and corn on the cob.  Enjoyed the food as it was prepared well and came out somewhat timely. Pricing was average and good for what you get.   Very popular concept style restaurant and fun to take out of town guest to."}
{"text":"I hate to even have to do this because I seriously love this place.  I've recommended it to so many people but my last encounter with them this past weekend made me not want to come back, at least for a very long time.  We got there around 3pm and the place was not packed at all.  Two of my friends were going to the movies right after for a 4:30 showing, so we thought because this place has such fast service, they could be in and out.  Not the case.  We put in our order around maybe 3:30.  We ordered cajun fries, those came out before our meal.  Before we knew it, we ate the entire basket of fries because we were THAT hungry.  It's about 4:00 now.  My friends have to miss their original movie time and push it back to the next show because we still have no food at our table.  I'm very observant, and I noticed there were 4 other tables with the same expression as us and we could tell they were just as fed up as we were.  There was a young man working the front and it seems like he's just a host.  When I tell you this kid did every single job in that restaurant, he literally was all over the place.  We ended up giving him a healthy tip because he had worked so hard between seating people, checking on food orders, getting drinks, cleaning tables and hell, he probably cooked the food too!  We probably saw our waitress 3 times throughout this entire time.  Finally my friend gets up to go ask what the hold up was.  I ordered shrimp, so I thought it couldn't take that long because it normally takes 15 minutes.  At about 4:15-4:20, we finally get our food.  I could tell my shrimp had just been sitting there because the bag wasn't steaming, the shrimp was bland and overcooked. It was just bad.  The service was awful minus the young kid at the front.  I could tell one of the other waitresses could see the expression on my face and heard me say I'm not coming back here again, because she kept asking if we were ok.  I'm not sure what happened within the last few weeks, because we were literally here about 3 weeks ago and it was PERFECT and it was packed, but we got our food in a timely manner.  I'll be taking a very long break from here because this last experience was unacceptable!"}
{"text":"Amazing fish, food of the gods. The food is so fresh and very hot in a good way though. I'm definitely coming back here multiple times."}
{"text":"Tasty and delicious but not very filling.  1 lb of king crab is $30 and feeds about 1 person.  (1 lb is Just 2 very big legs) Corn, potato, and sausage are the fillers while the shellfish are to be enjoyed for the amazing taste. Service was top notch, thanks Marc! Atmosphere is cool (way Better than original location)"}
{"text":"Solid 4.5 stars. (docked half a star for the slow service).  i've lived in Las Vegas for 6 months now, and can't believe it has taken me this long to try this place.  I have been to Boiling Crab and other places like it in Southern California, but this place is by far- my favorite.  The \"hot n juicy\" sauce is the best I've had.    I came with 2 other people, and we ordered  a calamari appetizer, 2 lbs of shrimp, 1 lb of crawfish, and a dungeness crab (2.4 lbs), and a side of rice.  And I am so glad I ordered the rice, because after all of the crustaceans were devoured, the rice was the perfect vessel to soak up the remaining sauce.    Everything was delicious, but the Dungeness Crab was the star.  Every bite was perfection- so meaty, so sweet, so juicy! This is now my go to place to bring Las Vegas visitors!"}
{"text":"What a fun experience! We had such a great time at Hot and Juicy! The food was cooked to perfection and the service was great- thank you Jesse for taking great care of us! I'm already looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Prepare to get messy (don't worry they will give you a bib and gloves)!  The food was awesome and cooked to perfection!"}
{"text":"I've been hearing many rave about this place out in Vegas and being a crawfish lover myself, it was a must eat! It's pretty darn good, the Hot and Juicy flavoring is the one with all the flavors combined. Nice rich butter and garlic flavored paired with Cajun spices. Probably you're best bet if you come here. And the host wasn't kidding when she said theirs is usually a little bit hotter than you think with the added garlic. I have a decent tolerance for spicy and normally here in San Jose I can eat the medium or spicy (on good days) and have no problem. I ordered the Mild and it already had a big kick to it. I do definitely want to come back because the day we came they said crawfish is in season but I know it really wasn't and so the crawfish was small and many of them were black and dead. The meat of the crawfish was not crispy and very flaky, not fresh at all. Great service by the waiter and host though."}
{"text":"Five stars for sureThis was my first time IN  Las Vegas and it was pretty good. A wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"Location: it is located on Mill avenue behind the PF Chang restaurant. They have plenty of tables you can choose from and can make reservation ahead of time.   Service: Our waitress was friendly, but wasn't very good at giving us refill at the beginning of our meal. She also didn't take away all the bags from our table when few of them were completely filled with trash and shelves in it. Nevertheless, she tried hard to keep up with our orders as much as she could. Overall the service is decent.   Food: the queen crab legs were soo good!!! So are the shrimps. The corn in hot & juicy sauce was so spicy and tasty that I ended up ordering two of them. The clam was a bit chewy and I probably will not order that again.   Rating: I will come back here again and again."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly service!! I love spicy and the snow crab and shrimp is to die for. The manager Lindsey on duty was amazing!! I will come back with friends and family."}
{"text":"Great seafood in the strip. Good prices. Nice staff and vibes. Hot n juicy mix is my fav !!"}
{"text":"Went here a couple times recently.  When I come here,  I always order crawfish.   Always.   I can eat a pound of crawfish faster than most folks,  so eating those in this place don't bother me.   Anything else, besides the bivalve shell creatures,  require too much work in a messy saucy environment.     I grew up eating crawfish.   I do love to eat them.   They are in season for about 5 months every year.   As a child,  I recall waiting for the first signs (billboards)  that appeared advertising crawfish boils.   So,  happy I was last spring when HnJ  and the AC opened in Phoenix.   I have been to HnJ 3 times this season.   2of the 3 experiences were stellar,  one was poor.   It seems as though when I bring a guest from home who loves Southern style crawfish and crab boils as much as I,  this place fails me!     I have come to the conclusion that HnJ is inconsistent. This is based on my 3 or so visits last year and this year.   When their seasoning and their crawfish are great,  I have a very good experience.   This week,  the crawfish was just OK,  a few straight tails in there (don't eat the straight tails).   But this time,  their usually thick and flavorful seasoning was liquidy and rather transparent.   *sigh*  I desperately want to call this place the King of seafood boils in Phoenix,  but,  alas,  AC is winning this battle for me.    The menu is fairly limited.   There isn't much more to choose from if you aren't having a seafood boil.     Kid Factor: 4/10 My Return Factor: 20%  sadly,  I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Ordered the Get Your Feet Wet.  First time here and probably the only time.   Food: the 1/2 piece of corn was soggy, over - cooked but tasted semi-ok.  The potatoes were, well, potatoes. The shrimp was great and plentiful!  The crayfish were fine (I am not a huge fan, but had to try it).  I think they are too much work for so little meat when paying by the pound.  The spiciness was great and the sausage was perfect to go with the meal.  The service staff was not too educated on their meals because she told me I would have to devein the shrimp.  Luckily I knew better on these type of shrimp and they showed me how to tear up and eat crayfish so it wasn't the end of the world. Otherwise, I was checked on many times for any refills or whatever.  Overall, not a bad meal made to order, but I'll stick to east coast or Louisiana for my boiled shrimp."}
{"text":"Alright! My first review write up!  First off, as a bay area native, I will admit that Boiling Crab was better in the area of flavor and freshness of the Dungeoness Crab.  BUT!   I did not have to wait 90 minutes for a table like BC, which makes it a huge plus! This was my first crawfish experience, and now I know not to order them next time. So much work for so little payout! I mean really?! I am not gonna pay $10+/lb for lil morsels of meat!  Next time, only crab and shrimp for me!  The shrimp and crab were much better and more meaty payoff. It wasn't the freshest, but for Vegas and the price it wasn't bad.   The hot & juicy special sauce did the job and make me reek of garlic for more than a day after!  I would eat here again and recommend it!"}
{"text":"I give 5 stars for great service but I will not be back. One must have a taste for this food. I ordered crawfish (1 pound) and shrimp (1 pound). I also ordered 2 snow crab baskets with Cajun fries. The shrimp and crawfish were staring right back at me and were in full shells. I guess I assumed they would be breaded and fried. I'm not knocking this place as some people like their food this way. I did however enjoy snow crab baskets. They aren't big enough to share but totally worth it. (13.99 each). The staff was very accommodating to let me exchange the crawfish for a snow crab basket. My husband and I did eat the shrimp because we love shrimp no matter what. It's in full shells with eyes too. A little weird but still good."}
{"text":"Yummy. Definitely juicy. We ordered hot and juicy mild and also medium flavours. The medium was pretty spicy for medium, be warned. Mild still has a bit of heat so might do that next time. A lb of king crab was two legs for which we paid $27. We also had the shrimp which was excellent and more value for $11. The dungeoness crab and lobster were too pricey on the day we went because they only had larger sized ones available, so the minimum order was pretty much two lbs. service was VERY friendly and efficient. I really enjoyed this dinner a lot!"}
{"text":"I either go to Hot N Juicy or have it delivered at least once a week. It's my all time favorite. I decided to take my mother their and enjoy dinner. The server took my order and I was specific about baby spice for The Drool(mother doesn't like spice) and a separate order of 1.5lbs of shrimp in Xtra Spicy(love the heat). Heidi the server let me know the 1.5lbs would be on separate bags (1lb and 0.5lb). I had no problem with that and I even repeated to her about 3 times for the Xtra spicy for the shrimp. She read it back and things were great. The shrimp comes first and it was baby spice. I reminded her that that wasn't correct. She said the kitchen made a mistake and took the shrimp back. Another server comes 2 minutes later with the shrimp she said it had been fixed but as I tasted one it had the same sauce as before and there was no spice in the bag. I brought it to my servers attention and she said she spoke to the manager and that they could only bring sauce on the side. No problem but the weird part was the server totally ignored my table after all that happened, didn't apologize for the mix up, and I was waiting a good 10 to 15 minutes for the Xtra Spicy sauce only for a different server to ask if I got the sauce ( which I hadn't). My original server Heidi serviced the table next to mine but never looked over or came to the table. I had to wave my hand in the air for water because she kept avoiding my table. Once the check came I noticed that it wasn't the kitchens fault. She put the order in wrong. So I asked for the manager only to find out there was never a manager on duty. I then spoke to the head server and the explanation she gave me wasn't an apology for mix up she had stated that when there are different orders they can't differentiate on the bag the different spice levels even though the table next to me had 4 different spice levels with 4 different flavors and there items weren't messed up. I let her know that I never got an apology and that was the hurtful part and all she said back was hey at least you got the sauce on the side. I was furious and sad. I left without a tip and feeling like the place I go to didn't care that it was their mistake and not mine. They kept making it seem like I was complaining that the spice wasn't 'hot enough'. I was sad because there was no spice and they kept making it seem like I ordered wrong.  It's highly upsetting and it makes me rethink about ordering or going in the restaurant again. It use to be my favorite up until this last visit last night 4/5/2018"}
{"text":"Food & service are good. Nice atmosphere with music playing. Downfall is they only sell beer and one type of wine by the bottle ONLY. They also ration all of their seasoning and condiments."}
{"text":"I am so happy that Hot N Juicy came to Phoenix!  I've never been to it in Vegas but while I was at work, one of the trainers came in and told me about it (she was getting lunch for her team.) I'm not going to write a lengthy review, I'm just going to touch on the important parts  -We waited for about 10 minutes before we were seated, which isn't bad considering it's a small place. -The customer service is wonderful! Our waitress (it was her first day but she did well) helped us pick out our food while a manager and other server hovered over her, which made me kind of nervous.  -The food. The food. The food. We all got shrimp but I will definitely the crawfish later. They were fat shrimp, the Hot N Juicy sauce and I thoroughly enjoyed eating them.  -I actually received the wrong order (I think I received Garlic Butter?) but they were happy to bring other 1/2 of what I wanted while I ate the other order. They never ended up bringing it (I did received a tub of Hot N Juicy Sauce to dip with) but we told them it was no big deal. We couldn't spend any more time peeling shrimp anyway!  -I used lemons in my water and later noticed little flies in my water... so that was disturbing.  The grand opening isn't for a few weeks, so I understand that there are issues.  I will definitely be going back then and writing another review!"}
{"text":"Came here today with my classmates to have lunch. The parking area is so small so it was hard to maneuver in and out of the parking lot.   The restaurant itself was pretty nice. Has the same feel as the other hot and juicy restaurant down the street which is also in spring mountain but is a bit smaller. I believe this was their original location and the inside is still super nice and has a casual ambience.   The service was great as was the food. The sauce is a bit spicy since it does have Cajun spices in the sauce but I really like how they have an option to get baby spice instead of mild or medium spice.   Our server was super nice and very attentive to our many requests. I never knew but our server also said if we would check in we would be getting free deep fried brownies. They were so delicious and we got 16 pieces because we didn't know they came 8 per check in on yelp or Facebook. I will for sure be coming back to this location in the future."}
