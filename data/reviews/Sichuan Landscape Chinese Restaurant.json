{"text":"Terrible service, very unorganized. We had been waiting for over an hour only to see the other table who came in later got their food served first. Even worse, the waitresses looked like they didn't care at all."}
{"text":"Terrible food quality and the food portion is way too small (tapa size) for main dishes.  For one of the dishes we order which btw is an authentic Sichuan dish, but it tasted like it's made from instant mix package you can buy from any Chinese supermarket, and there are no more than 10pieces of sliced meat, the whole dish is full of sliced onion.  Service was ok. Never going back again."}
{"text":"This restaurant appears to have good food, kind waiters and clean furniture however, appearances can be deceiving. I arrived at 6:45 pm with my parents and ordered 1 plate of fried rice, fried beef with hot sauce and beef fried noodles. I waited for almost half an hour and still no food was serverd. A group of six people came a little bit after we arrived and some how that group ordered more large and complex dishes than us and was already fully served in about 10 minutes. And as for us, no food yet. FINALLY! at 7:20 pm my mothers food had arrived! Shortly after at 7:30 my fathers plate of rice came. All that was left was my beef fried noodles. However we were losing our patience because as family, we like to eat together! So no one eats till everyone has been served. 7:48 pm absolutely nothing! We had enough everyone else is being served and not us! So we cancelled our order and left. This place seemed quaint and it's food seemed delicious honestly. The waiter started reminding us that our food was on the way. She first said that at twenty minutes after we arrived. However, the wait is not worth it for the food, food is not ment to be eaten cold and stomach's are not ment to be starving.  Don't come this restaurant unless you truly want to waste precious minutes of your life."}
{"text":"The  worst experience ever! They delivered my food to the wrong address caused even more delay.  I ordered delivery at 5:30pm, but got the food delivered to me after 7pm.  When I call them and asked about why the delivery took this long, the girl on the phone claimed she's the owner of the restaurant,  she said\" you can cancel the order, never order from us again.\" And hang up on me. I was shocked, never had this kind of experience. Just 5 minutes after she hang up on me, the delivery woman showed up. When I opened the bag, there was no napkins, no cullary,  food portion were much smaller than most sichuan restaurants next to it. Absolutely my last time there!"}
{"text":"Seriously?  This place is awful.  The food is barely edible, and I don't really consider myself that picky.  We ordered several dishes - fried pork kidney, cheng du dry hot chicken, ma po tofu - all of which are standard sichuan dishes.  All the dishes were spicy, but had absolutely no flavour!  The cheng du dry hot chickent had little fried pieces of overly sweet chicken and overly fat skin bits which we had to dig out from the mountain of hot chile peppers (where's the chicken, I found myself asking while digging around).  The kidneys were bland and tasteless.  Ma po tofu, which is so standard, it is the mark of a restaurant was horrible with a thick cornstarch sauce and no pork to speak of.  Sadly, the ma po tofu was probably the best dish of the bunch.    On top of all that, we ordered take out, and they jammed all the food into one bag when clearly it needed two.  As a result, when we opened the food at home (after a mere 5 minute walk), the ma po tofu had leaked all over the bag.  How much does an extra plastic bag cost?  5 cents?  Tops?  Don't understand why they couldn't spare an extra plastic bag to prevent spillage.  To me, this just speaks of a lack of respect to the customers.    There are so many Sichuan places in chinatown, I definitely will not be returning.  Sichuan house, just a couple of doors down is way better and makes one of the best ma po tofu dishes I have had in a long time."}
{"text":"Review your bill carefully. Last time they added one dish to our bill but we never order that, this time one item is priced 5 dollars higher than the menu price, and they just corrected it by pencil."}
{"text":"Very tasty authentic Chinese food. I had the spicy beef on rice and was surprised at how amazing it tasted. The portions are appropriate which is unfortunate because it definitely opened up my appetite.  The service is a little slow as we waited for maybe 15min for our dish to be served. A good idea is to call ahead and place order before even heading out. The really bad thing they should change is the fish tank. It is an eyesore with a few fish floating belly up in milky water. For that reason alone it should be 3-star or lower but the taste is so good it almost makes up for the rating."}
{"text":"This is literally my worst dining experience.  We booked a separate room and when we go there, we needed to pass through a greasy, dirty and narrow hallway connecting the kitchen. Frankly speaking, the food is fine, but when we were about to finish, the kitchen lady started to fight the lady working in the reception, who seemed to be the owner.  The kitchen lady cussed a lot and she was so loud that everyone in the restaurant could \"enjoy\". So we just wanted to pay the bill and get out.  But the lady said no credit card. Seriously?! we were 10 people dining there! Definitely would not go ever again!"}
{"text":"I eat here often.  I really do wonder if there are two restaurants that people are confusing because I love Sechuan Landscape.  It only has one room and you can't go through the kitchen.     It has incredibly good food. It is the best Chinese place that we have found on Spadina and we live just up the road.  Every time I eat here I am surprised by how wonderful a new dish is.  Last time it was the very tasty sweet and sour soup which was so much better than any other soup with the same name.  The prices are very good too.  Give it a try and make sure that the place you go into looks like the picture on Yelp."}
{"text":"Solid Sichuan cuisine. I have no complaint at all with the food. Everything that I had ordered always came the way I imagined it to be. Most chinese restaurants in Toronto are inconsistent. On certain days, the food is too sweet, too salty, or just completely bland. I had never had this kind of consistency in Toronto chinese restaurants. Since this place is near work and I often get sichuan food craving for like every 3 days, I could say that I come here at least 10 times per month. Price wise, it is more expensive than the usual chinese food at china town, but the consistency is worth it.  My only complain is service. I kinda expected that the staff don't speak english at all, so I reverted back to chinese when speaking with them. However, it is still annoying when I eat dumplings covered in chili oil and found that my glass has no water. This is very obvious when I came late at night when the waiters are these two 20-something boys.  There was a time when I came around 45 minutes before they close. I ordered 3 dishes. 15 minutes afterwards, they handed me the check even when the last dish hasn't come out. I paid the bill. 5 minutes after I paid, my last dish came and it was a spicy wonton. Not long after, came a group of 4 international students from china. They came in like 15 minutes before closing time!!! WTF is that!? One of the waiter seems to be friend with one of the international students. Not long, both went smoking right outside the door. I would have been fine with that IF their door is tight. IT IS NOT!!! I could not taste my dumplings at all!! All I could taste is their smoke!!! I did not see a point to continue eating when I can't taste anything AT ALL!!!  I would recommend coming during the day when the waitresses are these middle age ladies. They seem to ATLEAST treat you like human, not some lump of protein. Next time I have Sichuan food craving, I would probably peek at the window and check who's working first before I walk in."}
{"text":"Food was not too bad. We only got the double cooked pork and onion pancakes because we were still pretty full from the previous meal. They pancakes were tasty and crispy. The double cooked pork was average, nothing special. The double cooked pork taste better in the Sichuan house just a few steps away and is cheaper there as well.  The decoration is nice and better than other restaurants. And the seats look fancy and are comfy as well.  The reason for the lower than average rating is because of the service. It wasn't busy, in fact we were the only guests but they didn't come check on us or refilled our water. Out waitress was in the back having a nice conversation with her coworkers and we had to call them in order to get their attention. They also didn't smile once.   I might come back to try some other dishes to give it another try but it would have been a more pleasant experience, if the waitress was more attentive since we were the only guests."}
{"text":"Came here a year ago with my dad and we're both avid fans of spicy food. The decor with tablecloth and highback chairs seem to indicate it's pricey but whatever we got was totally not spicy enough! Avoid and go to the glass tabled place up the street!"}
{"text":"I love it here. Their steamed veggie dumplings are the best. I also love their chive pancakes.It is crunchy and delicious.  I tried their dessert, I don't remember the name of it, but it is soup like and it had Chinese dates. It wasn't bad at all. The service was teriffic. I will be returning again, that's for sure! This is authentic Chinese food at it's best."}
{"text":"Ordered take out from this place by phone at 6:30pm, was told that food would be ready at 7:00. Came here to pick up at 7:00, got the food at 7:35. Service was bad, attitude was worse."}
{"text":"Honestly, after reading all of these reviews. I'm left wondering if I ate at the same restaurant as my fellow yelpers.   I ate here at Sichuan Landscape tonight with my girlfriend and we loaded up on food, after driving up from Buffalo N.Y. on empty stomachs, we were hungry! So we ordered the Sichuan Smoked Duck (half), Hunan Beef, Double-cooked Pork, Mushroom & Vegetable, and the Stir Fried Baby Bok Choy.   Neither of us has had better Chinese food up until today. Suffice to say, the Sichuan Landscape had the most flavorful, authentic and tasty Chinese food either of us had ever had.  Even the best Dim Sum restaurants in NYC's Chinatown or Brooklyn, or Flushing in Queens NY could compare. The ingredients were all of a very high quality. Normally I can taste an aftertaste in Chinese food or in most restaurant food for that matter, because it's usually very highly chemically contaminated because of the conventionally raised/grown meat and vegetables. However, tonight's meal tasted just like a home cooked meal using organic farm to table ingredients.  Seriously did any of you actually eat here?   Maybe we just got lucky tonight... Regardless, next time I'm in Toronto, I know where I'm going first!  Yours Truly,   Josh Krouse... A truly satisfied customer!"}
{"text":"Had a solo dinner here tonight, like the fact that they have smaller plates (which would be lunch special size) in the evening. No need for a doggie bag to take the excess home. Really impressed that they have linen table cloths and upholstered chairs. Really folks, Chinese food on Spadina can be such an iffy proposition, you really have to go with an open mind. Service was a little slow, as there is only one waitress who of course speaks little English, but what she brings out is delicious, and not expensive at all. Had the Kung Pow chicken with rice. Really imprewssed it wasn't just some breaded chicken balls qith cuts of green peppers like the usual delivery suspects provide.Waitress claimed they had been there 17 years, but I think its a lnguage proble. Please eat here, don't let them wither away to a red glop house! And FREE wifi!"}
{"text":"the taste is ok. But the service is not that good and charges the price higher than on the menu!"}
{"text":"I agree with previous review by Josh K. It's possible that some of the reviews aren't for the correct restaurant since there are a few restaurants with Sichuan in its name in Toronto. Some of those ratings seem unfair if it is indeed the correct restaurant.  In any case, I was walking around Chinatown looking for a restaurant that accepts Mastercard. Unfortunately, I couldn't use Yelp as I didn't have internet service as I was visiting Toronto from the US.  So I stumbled into this restaurant after seeing they accept Mastercard (if you spend $10+) and I'm glad I did. First of all, I was pleasantly surprised with its modern decor and clean, updated bathroom. The chairs were really comfortable and much needed after walking around so much.   But the real star of the show was the food. I got the Kung Pao Chicken and a beef dish with onions (can't remember the name). But both were delicious and I would say Sichuan Landscape rivals the best Chinese resto in Tampa (Yummy House) in terms of taste. I'm really quite surprised at the negative reviews but I do understand the comments about bad service, which is why I deducted a star.  I had to flag the waitress down to refill my drink and  she didn't check up on us.  Considering I was Yelpless, I think this restaurant was a good find and I'd recommend it."}
{"text":"WTF? I went there for Asia Food Fest. And 3 dishes for 19.99 per person. Is this a wannabe buffet or a rip off place to go? Maybe both??"}
{"text":"If it were up to me, I would have been much more loyal to my Yelp app when trying to find a Chinese restaurant after a show at El Mocambo on a recent trip to Toronto. Sadly, with no wifi and no international plan, this sad American was forced to just duck into the first open place she saw.   The first thing that I feel that I should say about this place is that they did little to disprove the probably very annoying stereotype that Canadians have to deal with that they put maple syrup on everything. Because I have never in my life been served sweet and sour pork using syrup until this night. And it was definitely syrup - no mistake about it. It didn't taste awful, but it was a bizarre experience for my taste buds.   Secondly, the staff spoke no English. OK, probably to be expected at an authentic Asian restaurant, but it was to the point where the waiter couldn't understand when we were asking for water, another chair, or to order our food - very essential things! Finally someone else stepped in who was a bit better, but after a lot of painful blank stares.   Also, I found it very, very odd that we were served warm to lukewarm water with our meals. Hot water would have been great, as it was freezing cold outside and would help warm us up. Cold water, more standard but equally welcome. But lukewarm water that tasted dirty was just not the business.   We did eat a lot of food and left the place full. But unfortunately in Chinatown I expect more than just full, I expect satisfaction in flavor as well!"}
{"text":"To sum up, shit service, small serving, and OK taste.   I tried another Sichuan restaurant a bit south from this place and loved it. But when I walked pass this one tonight, it was a crowded house, so I decided to give it a try.   I walked in, stood in front of the door and wait to be seated like in another other Chinese restaurants in town. However, the waiters were too busy chatting behind the counter to notice me. After I tried harder by waving to them couple times, I finally got to sit down. Without any greeting, a guy in black brought over a cup of water and a menu book, then immediately left without even saying hello. Of course, he did not bother to ask what I would prefer, tea or water.   The menu is not impressive so I decided to just order the classic Dan Dan Noodle. When it arrived, the dish was as small as the size of a side dish in French restaurants! The small serving is barely enough for someone who is on a serious diet. On the other hands, tableware should have been placed before the dish and napkins are among the basics. However, at this place, the waitress waited until she came to serve the dish that she brought over a pair of chopsticks, which were in a weird head-to-toe order. And of course, she must thought that I would not need the napkin so did not bother to give me one or ask me.   The waiters at this place are quite inattentive. None of them had ever approached and checked with me if I need anything. In order to get the bill, I had to ask two waitresses and waited for like 10 minutes. When I got the changes, again, they automatically assume that I would not need the receipt and had all the numbers at the back of my head, so they did not bother to leave a receipt for me.   The place stands out among other small Chinese restaurants nearby probably largely because of its slightly modern decoration. However, this is a poor representation of Chinese customer service practice.   For those who like authentic Sichuan food, good services, and big servings, I recommend going to another Sichuan restaurant which is just one block south of this place."}
{"text":"BOTTOM LINE: A solid Chinese resto in Chinatown that is actually clean! Their spicy noodle soups rock.  This new addition to Chinatown recently opened up next to the New Ho. The interior is clean and the staff are friendly [shock!].  It's your typical Chinese resto with over 100 items on it, but since it's Sichuan, they have some wonderfully spicy offerings. I've come a few times and ordered their spicy noodle soups for about $8 each. They're made fresh and they've got some serious kick to it. The noodles are nice and chewy and the broth is very flavourful. The also pack a decent amount of meat and veggies. Overall, it's a solid place to dine at."}
{"text":"Food is very authentic and mostly consistent. Service is the type that you normally get in Chinatown, but this is not important from a Chinese's perspective."}
