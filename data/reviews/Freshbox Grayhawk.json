{"text":"Great place! It is comforting to eat somewhere that cares what goes into their food. It is a little pricey but it's worth it knowing you are getting the best ingredients!"}
{"text":"Fantastic salads, mostly organic and great portion size at a good price!  Wonderful ingredients to choose from, delicious stevia lemonade and healthy raw snacks!  Clean, friendly!"}
{"text":"Tried for the first time today.  Had the Cobb salad.  People who rave about it have never had a good one.  The chicken and eggs were overcooked, the avocado was grossly overripe, and the blue cheese was in pieces so tiny that they were unrecognizable visually or by taste.  $12 for a bad salad left me feeling ripped off. I applaud the use of organic ingredients and free-range chicken and eggs.  I know that adds to the cost.  If you overcook them and use produce that is halfway to rotten, however, my applause disappears. On the positive side, this place does have creative dressing choices.  Maybe you can buy the dressing and put it on a better salad, because it's wasted on what you get here."}
{"text":"My wife & I tried the Fruit Patch smoothie...Fantastic!!  Cool and Refreshing.  We are fans of Healthy AND Tasty this saved our afternoon.  The Customer Service was outstanding...Warm and Comfortable.  Alex, the Operations Manager, takes the lead displaying Great Customer Service and the entire staff knows the menu very well.  Thanks Alex & Freshbox.  We are planning to return and to bring our friends."}
{"text":"Great addition to the area north of the 101. Everything was fresh, local, organic and very yummy. I had the Holey Moley which had great flavor a. The staff was awesome. Definitely will be returning!"}
{"text":"Omg WHERE HAVE THEY BEEN ALL MY LIFE?!  This review is for the new location on Thompson peak and Bell.  I write very few reviews but just couldn't be lazy and not acknowledge this place!  I cannot find any fault at all here and I am extremely nitpicky with health food.  They serve all organic, grass fed, no antibiotics etc etc.. Even the water they use in the food is purified!  As someone who struggles with chronic illness I'm able to eat here totally guilt free.  It's delicious and super healthy. LOVE IT!!!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Just stopped by for a lunch with the little girl I nanny. They have great healthy options for kids and adults. They have free wifi and the two owners are really nice and informative as well. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Wow. If your looking for healthy food this place is the bomb. All creations come in salad or wraps. Juices fresh made right in front of you. Fast friendly service. Loved it."}
{"text":"Great food! Fresh and locally sourced. First time here,certainly won't be the last.  In a sea of fast food, it's an island oasis! My highest recommendation!"}
{"text":"Just found out about this place today, two words, FRESH and TASTY!  Run don't walk and try it.  I had the Park Cobb but I added Brussel sprouts and cucumber!  YUM"}
{"text":"I am all about local farmers and fresh ingredients. Freshbox is a great place to design your own salad or wrap. There were so many choices and varieties. Everything was so fresh! The staff was very friendly and helpful on my first visit. I didn't know what to expect walking in but they handed us menus and really helped us know exact ingredients in certain thnigs along with not pushing us to order quickly. If I lived closer I would go to this place more often. The prices are about what you would spend somewhere else but for me one wrap is two meals. I love the fast casual environment of Freshbox as well."}
{"text":"Absolutely a gem.  All organic, juice, smoothie, salad and sandwich offerings.  The portions are generous.  A wonderful place to go for a healthy meal that makes you feel great the rest of the day.  My favorite is the rocket fuel juice with jalape√±o."}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant!! Healthy food--the real deal! All organic and fresh ingredients. Leave feeling good about what you ate and that you supported a local family-run restaurant! Don't miss out!!!!"}
{"text":"SOOOOOO GOOD! The service was above and beyond wonderfull, you can tell everyone working there is very passionate about the food they are serving. It was the best wrap I have ever had! It was the Park Ave Cobb! You get so much bang for your buck, while prices intially seem a little high, you get so much food and such high quality of food as well! Will be my go to spot from now on !"}
{"text":"The description following the choice of 5-stars is accurate: \"Woohoo! As good as it gets!\"  I'm picky about the quality of ingredients I eat so I'm grateful this place opened in North Scottsdale.   Fresh Box essentially offers big salads (or wraps if you prefer) and smoothies / juices (plus soup, homemade lemonade, and cold brew coffee).   They source grass-fed(!!!) beef, organic chicken / organic tofu (if tofu is your thing), and local organic produce for their food. It's not 100% organic but they do as much as they can. I'm not sure the dairy (cheeses) are from pasture raised animals, but they seem open-minded so perhaps they can look into that.   We've tried four of their salads so far: Seoul food (asian inspired and spicy), Wholey Moley (mexican inspired - this one is my husband's favorite so far), Herban Cowboy (just as you'd imagine with some bbq sauce - very good), and my favorite so far, the Park Ave Cobb - loaded with creamy textures and fullness.   You can build your own salad, too, but I'm still working my way through their signature salads.  We like everything we've tried - a lot. The portions are large and filling. I don't bark at the prices (about $13 per salad) because they're big, mostly organic, and have grass fed beef or organic chicken. Those ingredients are not cheap so I'm willing to pay for the quality. Oh, they also don't use cheap crap oils. They cook the beef, for example, in avocado oil. No canola oil in the house. SCORE!  We've had the Gogo Green smoothie and it was so good. They nailed it on this recipe with lots of healthy fats, nutrient greens, and just lightly sweetened - nothing overpowering. I am eager to go back for that number.  They make a terrific stevia extract sweetened lemonade that my family loves. We never order lemonade at other restaurants because they're always made with crap stevia or crap sugar. Fresh Box made it just like I would do if I made it with a quality stevia. Refreshing and delicious and just lightly sweet in flavor.   They don't have kid food per se, but they're working on that. My interest for my 4 year old (who usually orders off the adult menu anyway because I don't want her eating only beige food which is often the result of children's menus, right?) is that she could order a half salad or maybe one of their homemade dressings with veggie crudite. They also offer hummus and chips but that's not our thing - being gluten free as we are. Ordering a half salad is not officially on the menu but they said they'd do it. Kids could also get soup or smoothies.   I hope they do well because I'd like this to become a regular spot for my family - if there is one thing I loathe making, it's salads. I love knowing I can come here for one with quality ingredients to nourish my body. No guilt.  Oh, the service is super friendly, too. :)"}
{"text":"found this place last weekend. So delicious, healthy and restaurant quality service with fast-food time commitment.  So many veggie options and great kids menu.  Appropriately priced which is really refreshing in this neighborhood.  Will be a regular. Welcome to the hood!"}
{"text":"Great and tasty fresh food for a decent price. Staff is friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"This place just opened and I already really like it. Fresh organic juices and smoothies. I had the the GoGo Green and changed it a bit and they did an amazing job. It was not watered down. For my lunch I had the Pho King signature salad but as a wrap...wow I liked it a lot!  Fresh local organic produce. The portions they serve are nice size. I also tried their cold brewed coffee. Now I'm not much of a cold brewed coffee drinker since most places I tried were either watered (iced down) or bitter, but this was very good...smooth with a rich coffee flavor. The owners and the help are very excited to be here and are more than excited to serve you. Nice people! I'm definitely very please with this place and ever so thankful to have an organic fresh food restaurant in North Scottsdale. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Seoul food salad was spicy, but perfectly matched with coconut dressing. A great neighborhood weekday dinner pick up place catered to clean diet."}
{"text":"I love this place and I'm addicted to so many delicious items on the menu & I feel great after eating here. However, lately I'm disappointed about the dressing options...really miss the pom vinaigrette and blood orange dressing...& please bring back the goat cheese! Also went there today and they were out of wraps and closed on Sunday's...I'm really hoping this place stays in business I love it here but worried about recent changes. I'll keep coming back in hopes they will bring back some of their items..."}
{"text":"Finally, a quick and organic juice and salad shop in the North Valley. The name Freshbox is truly fitting! When you walk in the door your hit with a wonderful aroma of fresh fruits and veggies. With the help of the manager ( who was extremely knowledgable about the menu)  I decided on a juice called The Alien. It was packed with fresh veggies and absolutely delicious!  Freshbox definitely on my favorite list."}
{"text":"I went in on Opening day and they were still getting their menu items set up.  I didn't have a menu to refer to so I gave them an idea of what I liked and they whipped up a delicious dairy-free smoothie.  The staff was super friendly and helpful.  This is a great place for quick foods, smoothies, juices, and for people with food intolerances or special diets."}
{"text":"Between this place, Mad Greens, and Whole Foods, North Scottsdale has a ton of salad options. I got the Herban Cowboy, and the staff had no problem substituting chicken for tofu. The salad was fresh and delicious, and I grabbed a hummus box for later.   I loved the presentation! These trays are adorable, and the cold brew tea was delicious."}
{"text":"I am so happy to have found this place! Highly recommend the clean food.  I am impressed at the effort the store has put in toward informing the customer about their meal and where it comes from. I value clean eating.  I recommend this as one of my favorite lunch spots to friends and family.  Thanks Freshbox! Stay deliciously healthy!"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this amazing spot on my way to the gym after a long day at work. Tried the jolt protein smoothie for a quick pick me up and was beyond impressed! Will definitely be dining here on the regular as I noticed their entire menu if allergy friendly! The staff is also amazing; extremely nice and so helpful! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I eat here 3-4 times a week since they open.  Love it.  Their food is good and I love that I can design my own salad.  I'm not vegan or gluten free, I just try to eat organic and healthy and this place fits the bill.  For sure check them out.  They even have a loyalty card."}
{"text":"The guys who run the place are great and the food is even better. They have salads, wraps, smoothies and juice and I can say I've never tried anything I didn't like! The potions are pretty big so come hungry. Best part is the ingredients are super healthy so you can feel good about leaving full. Make sure you don't leave without trying the watermelon/jalape√±o lemonade! Sounds crazy but it's one of my favorite drinks now."}
{"text":"Salad was big enough (as was the price) and ingredients looked fresh, but salad really wasn't all that tasty. I had the Cobb that had bacon and chicken, and its hard to go wrong with bacon, but it didn't much taste like the bacon I've tasted. I like this concept, but hopefully they can tweak thinks to make it taste better.  $12 for a salad, even in Scottsdale might be a bit much.  I didn't get the suggested dressing and got an avocado dressing and maybe that was a problem.  Maybe not the best choice because the dressing was as tasteless as the salad."}
{"text":"LOVE the 'Wholey Moley' salad box ....my fav... soooo good!!  The ice teas are delicious also!!   Glad to find a 'go to' place for food that has fresh, delicious healthy organic food!!   Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Friendly staff. The wraps and salads are fresh and full of flavor. My kiddo digs the quesadilla. The star at fresh box is their da jolt! Best smoothie ever!"}
{"text":"Freshbox is one of the best organic and clean eating places near me. It offers a wide variety of delicious and healthy options. I typically order the Gogo Greens smoothie without stevia extract, but add in vanilla protein. The perfect mix of coconut milk, kale, avocado, spinach, and banana are a delight to the clean-eater. The staff is very friendly and willing to help you make the best choice. I would recommend going in and I know I will visit often. The only downside is it is a bit pricy; however, you know you're eating healthy."}
{"text":"I just discovered this place on Sunday and made my third trip back today, Wednesday!   I have tried the Park Ave Cobb, Herban Cowboy and the Wholey Moley salad and all three have been amazing! The portions are very large and the quality of ingredients is really impressive. They also make their own dressings which have been delicious. It is a bit more money than I would typically spend on lunch, but I feel genuinely full and think you are definitely getting what you pay for here. I've also tried a juice and two smoothies and really enjoyed all three. The fruit punch smoothie was my favorite so far.   Aside from the incredible food, I really appreciate of the genuine staff. Every time I've come in, they are willing to offer suggestions and seem to just have a really good, positive vibe. On my first visit, they had brewed a new raspberry tea and asked my opinion. I raved about it and they ended up bringing me a free tea to go. How cool is that?!?!   Everything about this place just makes me feel better. I'm really happy to have found this awesome gem!"}
{"text":"Solid build-your-own healthy rice/noodle/salad bowl place. The ingredients all tasted and looked very fresh, and there is a wide selection of options. Similar to GrabbaGreen, but I'd say a little better.   I can't remember the name of it, but I had an Asian noodle bowl and it was very good. Would be nice if it were slightly cheaper, but what can you expect with how trendy these types of places are now."}
{"text":"awesome place!  great selection of veggies to choose from....LOTS actually!  salad dressings are on the spicy / oil side with little sugars which is nice.  you can get wraps, salads, juices, etc.  i wish they would open more of these."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place.   My diet focuses on organic, grass-fed, good fats, no sugar...  This is right up my alley.  I had the Cobb salad with Turmeric Ginger dressing.  It was fresh, delicious and a decent portion size too."}
{"text":"I really like the food, but the $$ is too steep...especially since the recent change in the container which reduced it's size by half...now it's certainly not worth the $12 for a very small salad. Although I love the food, I can't justify that cost with the reduction in size."}
{"text":"Absolutely fresh and delicious. Great for raw vegans, vegans, vegetarians, carnivores, and everyone in between. I've introduced many of my unhealthy-eater friends to Fresh Box and turned them into fresh loving freaks like me!   Every single thing we've tried, we loved. Full of flavor, which many don't expect from fresh food. My goal is to try every single item on the menu, but I keep getting spoiled by the same few items. It takes several visits to even think about trying something else.   David, the owner, is a dream. Kind and personable and he really cares about his customers. Very humble man he is. A big plus for my desire to patronize his establishment."}
{"text":"Fresh Box is a fast/casual High End salad, wrap, smoothie and juice place. Ingredients here are locally sourced and organic. High end oils are used like avocado oil and high end sweeteners are used like coconut sugar.   You have your choice of building a salad yourself or picking an already thought out salad from the menu so I went with the sumac daddy salad because that sounded different and unique. My salad was made with FREE RANGE sumac coated tender fresh chicken, turmeric coated cauliflower, other fresh vegetables, quinoa and a better quality feta cheese that was creamy and not too salty. The Tahini cucumber dressing that came with it was interesting. The salad was very large but satisfying and filling but not in a heavy way.  My husband built his own salad with grass fed steak. The steak was fresh tender and flavorful. He also picked a bunch of other items including pickled onions that were tasty. We both thought his cilantro dressing was very good.  The people working there were friendly and helpful and the salads were prepared quickly. The dining area was attractive and seemed clean."}
{"text":"Dang! That's a good salad! Got the Herban Cowboy and was served by a super nice, extremely helpful young lady who really seemed to enjoy working there. The salad was refreshing and really unique, the tea was flavorful and fresh and not too sweet, and the service was spectacular. It wasn't cheap - not gonna lie, but I ate half and am enjoying the other half 5 hours later and its still really really good, so its reasonable for two meals. Hint: the BBQ is really tomatoey (i'm gonna say that's a word), its not like sugary bbq sauce. The nice young  lady who made it for me threw in a side of avocado dressing (because that's the way she likes it), which made the whole thing PERFECT. I bragged on them at the hospital, so hopefully you guys will packed soon. Another hint: if you pay with a credit card, they don't have a line for a tip, so make sure you bring cash - they're super helpful Gluten Allergy FREIIIIINDLY!"}
{"text":"So excited this place is open!  Being picky about the food you eat can sometimes leave you limited on options.  But not anymore!  Organic, fresh and grass fed meats, yum!  They make all their dressings from scratch and the serving sizes were huge!  The staff was SO friendly and open.  They are talking about expanding the menu to include breakfast too, can't wait!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  Huge large salads made to order.  I don't venture out of my norm but it's tempting.  Someday I'll brave their juices.  Maybe a little pricey...but not for Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Great ideas, excellent food, incredibly friendly staff. They just opened so they are still working on getting the flow of everything down, but there is a lot of potential. From what I understand, everything is organic and locally bought. I had the Herban Cowboy wrap, which was very good. With the first bite I was blasted with a variety of unique and delicious flavors.   The portion sizes are very generous. I typically eat a lot, and I was able to take half of my wrap back home. It is somewhat pricey, but that is the cost of local / organic. In addition to their signature salads / wraps, you can also build your own.   Overall it was an enjoyable dining experience, and I would return if I'm in the area and looking for something healthy."}
{"text":"Great concept, friendly service but $12.95 for a salad and then charged an additional .95 cents for extra dressing, and $4 for an iced tea is just outrageous. My total was around $18 for a salad meal!  Thats just crazy."}
{"text":"Freshly open just within about a month, I was happy to discover this healthy eatery just next door to a gluttonous burger shop. Talk about ying and yang! I stopped by for some takeout and upon entering, was greeted by a friendly lady who immediately walked me through the entire process.   The way this eatery works is that everything is fresh and made to order. They have a buffet style of vegetables, protein and dressing options to choose from. First, you decide whether or not you would like a salad, wrap or bowl with rice. From there, you get to choose between a wide variety of toppings including avocado, corn, peppers, lettuce, etc. Everything is non-GMO and all natural. In addition, all the salad dressings, hummus and lemonade is made in-house. It's as fresh as can be!   I decided to go with a wrap and put chicken, corn, avocado, lettuce, tomato, peppers and a delicious yogurt ranch inside. It was a hearty and very filling wrap with delicious flavor. Their ranch is yogurt based so on the healthier side and the wraps come with homemade hummus and pita chips.   I was very happy with my meal and service and will definitely be frequenting this healthy eatery often!"}
{"text":"Every time I come here I'm never disappointed.  The service is great the food is fresh I don't have to wait long.  It's like an organic healthy version of subway but way better.  The price is worth every penny seriously! The salad is big enough for lunch & dinner.  Give em a try it's totally worth it  The ranch was not to my liking but that's ok I substituted it for a spicy coconut vinaigrette which was lip smacking amazing."}
{"text":"Great healthy choices! I tried the Park Ave and Herban Cowboy and both hit the spot. To top it off the Go Go Green Smoothie was a nice compliment to an already healthy meal."}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh, and healthy food! I had driven past a different either old (or not yet opened) Freshbox location on Thompson Peak and Bell before, and was happy to find out one had just opened in Grayhawk.  The concept of this place is awesome, very similar to GrabbaGreen, though I think I prefer Freshbox over GrabbaGreen now. I love how all the fresh veggies and ingredients are on display, very appealing. I also like the design, like how the lights are in wooden crates and the overall setup. At first I was only going to get a juice. I love vegetables, but not big on vegetable juices, so I tried the Firefly because there was apple and lemon in it. I hate to say, but the juice was room-temperature and I could only taste carrot and an overpowering ginger flavor. I was disappointed and told someone working there. I said I wanted to buy a salad instead and he was super nice about it, and gave me the salad for free which I was super grateful for! I got a build your own salad and it was awesome! I got kale and arugula for my leafy greens, black beans, quinoa, sweet potato, and broccoli for my four toppings, and goat cheese and almonds for my premium toppings. Also had the creamy avocado dressing. I really enjoyed the salad, very fresh and the portions were large. I would love to come back and try out their cool lemonade flavors, they sounded excellent! I will definitely be returning, a little expensive, but completely worth it!"}
{"text":"I was really impressed with the food at fresh box! It was my first time coming here. I ordered the Seoul Food which comes with organic spring mix, chilled rice noodles, house made kimchi, charred broccoli, shredded purple cabbage, mung bean sprouts, grass fed steak, and coconut chili vinaigrette. The wrap was humongous! It was enough to feed at least three or four adults! The coconut chili dressing was phenomenal! I will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Great concept, good food, nice staff, HIGH prices.  I got a salad, and a lemonade and paid $16.  The food is good, everything is healthy, even down to the dressings- but I can't justify spending that much on a salad."}
{"text":"This place is great! So many options to choose from which is perfect for our family which has a vegan, a vegetarian and a carnivore. The portions are large and everything is fresh and delicious. Great smoothies too. My daughter loves the blueberry with oats."}
{"text":"I tried this place out about 3 weeks ago and fell in love. The portions were large, so for $12 I could eat half my salad and save the rest for the next day or next meal which made up for the kind of pricey amount for a salad. They have some really rest and fresh options to create your own salad which makes it fun every time you go. The staff is always friendly and I enjoy them when I'm there getting my to-go items.   I went back a few days ago, excited to make my own salad for lunch and save the rest for lunch the following day; which always makes my life easier. However, they increased their prices, and got new to-go containers that are half the size and are cardboard. I paid $12 for a salad that was half the size that it normally is, so it's barely enough for one meal. I tried to make it work and only eat half and the instead get a juice. I packed the salad (dressing on the side) and brought it home for the next day. The next day I opened the salad and it was stale and soggy and not edible. The new contains are horrible and wasted a meal.   I will not be going back. I am very disappointed, and I had been going every other day for 3 weeks up until the management made these horrific changes."}
{"text":"The service was great. The veggies were fresh and crispy. You can choose from a menu of salads or make up your own--everything we tried was delicious."}
{"text":"First time here and it was delicious! The ginger lemonade is yummmmmm. The staff was welcoming and very friendly, and the place is very clean. I'll definitely be back for another visit."}
{"text":"Love this place! Delicious and healthy, what more can you ask for. Only wish I could get delivery or that there was a drive through."}
{"text":"AWSOME salad and great employees. So fresh and salad dressings are SO good. Just wish it was closer to me I would be there so much more"}
{"text":"I was hungry for something healthy and found this place.  The prices seemed way overpriced but the location is in the heart of high priced Scottsdale.  The toppings on the salad are all cold and I wish they were hot or warm as cold sweet potatoes and brussels sprouts really do not taste good.  The concept is good.  But paying upwards of $10+ for a lunch salad is bit too expensive.  The buttermilk dressing has way to much spice and pepper in it which is not listed as the ingredients.  There are other good salad places in and around Scottsdale which are priced less expensive and offer more options.  It is nice to check out, but I will not be back.  This place reminded me of fired pizza except it is a salad place or you can make it into a wrap which I could not do as I was allergic to one of the ingredients in the wrap which they make fresh daily.  Upon entering they said I can try as many of the ingredients for free but after the second one they said I could not have any others so much for trying as many as I wanted to."}
{"text":"I'm obsessed. Since going here a couple weeks ago, I've been back to the North Scottsdale-Greyhawk shop almost daily.  To say it is a wrap and salad place doesn't really do freshbox justice.  There is a short list of really interesting, pre designed combinations....I highly recommend going this route first.  The wraps are completely filled with healthy, delicious flavors that will make you think twice about the normal sandwiches and wraps we all eat. The herban cowboy wrap is my favorite so far.  It is a chicken wrap with wall to wall vitamins and minerals. Sweet potatoes, arugula, red cabbage, non GMO corn, sunflower seeds and more in the HC.  I don't normally love wraps but this place rocks my world. I've introduced quite a few friends and everyone has the same reaction--DELIGHT!"}
{"text":"Still my favorite place in North Scottsdale for organic juices, smoothies, wraps, salads and soup.  It is great to call ahead and they will have it waiting for you.  Great staff."}
{"text":"Really great experience! Loved how fresh this place was. Quality ingredients and great service. I got a salad turned into a wrap and when i asked to substitute a few items and swap out dressings they didn't mind. Really great to have a healthy alternative in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Wow is this place awesome! Great food and drinks and absolutely worth the price because everything is so fresh and delicious. The owner and his brother are very attentive and open to feedback with excellent customer service skills. I'm hooked on the Pho salad! You will be happy with your experience here if you like healthy, fresh, yummy food with speedy service and an energetic vibe!"}
{"text":"Really nice people that run it and we try to go there a few times a month but the food is average and for the price it's below average imo"}
{"text":"Wow wow wow...Finally a resturant with fresh choices that won't break the bank..staff was friendly and helpful..can't wait to come back!!!"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to a great salad for dinner after having a Da Jolt smoothie earlier in the day. I returned with a friend about 6:30pm for dinner. Two other ladies walked in just before us. All 4 of stood and waited to be greeted. Finally 1 of the employees (there were 2), stopped making a takeout salad to get an order from the other pair. My friend and I waiter 18 minutes before anyone even said hello, gave us a nod, apologized for the wait, anything. If it weren't for the beautiful fresh ingredients displayed in the restaurant, we would have taken our business to one of the many other choices in the plaza. But wait we did. The 2nd employee finally greeted us, explaining she had an order for 9 salads and that's why she couldn't help us sooner. Well, that person isn't here. We are. And now we are HANGRY. I ordered the Cobb and iced tea. The salad was good, not great, and the overall experience was definitely not worth the $16 price tag. I won't rush back even though this restaurant is 5 minutes from my office."}
{"text":"Very happy that a place like this is in my neighborhood. Fresh salads and wraps whenever we want now. I tried the \"Herben Cowboy\" and loved it. Also tried a cup of the chicken soup that was just ok. The place is very clean and the people working there are very courteous and professional. They also are good at recommending great things. We also got to sample a lot of different things. Try one of there chocolate bars for desert."}
{"text":"Thank god for fresh box. There are few choices for healthy food in north Scotsdale. Fresh box delivers on the need for quick healthy salads and juices at an unbeatable price. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Freshbox is one of my favorite places to eat at least 2x a week and i have over 60 visits total. It's healthy, fresh, portions are substantial, prices are fair, service is outstanding, the owners and employees really appreciate there patrons. They genuinely care about delivering fresh and healthy food options and supporting the community in there healthy lifestyle. you can call in your order or stop bye, as we often do and pick up our salad or wraps after our work outs. It is a family business which we value and proudly support."}
{"text":"Healthy food... it really is \"fresh\" and it's also tasty.  They make great salads and smoothies.  They have some recipes ready for you or you can create your own.  This could be the future of fast food if people start making better choices.  The prices are a bit more expensive but this is what real food that is locally farmed costs.  Not chemicals made in a factory."}
{"text":"Love this place. All food is local from AZ and you can taste the freshness. It truly makes a difference. It's a little pricey but that's pretty understandable considering the quality"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place considering it's a short distance from my house but unfortunately this really missed the mark. The lemonade I had was akin to ice cold dirty dish water. It tried sipping it a couple different times and ended up just throwing it out, it didn't taste like it had ever been near a lemon.  The Herban Cowboy I had was just okay, tasted fresh but the flavors were kind of all over place and at the pricepoint, I'd rather just go to whole foods two miles down the road and make a salad myself. Which I wish I could have done here because not even did the staff say hello to me in a customerless restaurant, but they took a solid ten minutes to make a salad.  Overall: awkward, bland experience. Best wishes Freshbox!"}
