{"text":"Awesome wings. Really good prices. Quick service. More of a take out place than dine in which Is perfect for me. Gem in Scarborough, their combos are really good value. Will be my go to wing place."}
{"text":"The wing are pretty good. The lemon pepper i think was the best. It bit on the pricer side but well worth it."}
{"text":"We were intrigued by some of their flavors - terydactyl (that's how they spelled it), mystery, treasure island, suicide & Texas homicide (5 pepper rating \"extremely hot eat at your risk\"). After numerous questions and sauce tastings we decided on lemon pepper and regular homicide wings with blue cheese dip, spicy garlic parmesan onion rings and bacon cheddar fries. While waiting for our order we noticed a number of regulars coming in to pick up their to go orders. We decided to take ours to go as well. In the car we opened our styro containers so we could at least taste everything while it's hot.   Bacon cheddar fries - tasted like they used frozen french fries, not fresh. Cheese was already starting to harden. Bacon looked and tasted like Bac-os (soy alternative to bacon), please see picture.  Spicy Garlic Parm Rings - The garlic was a sauce and not a dry seasoning. It tasted like they used pre-made frozen onion rings. They were not spicy nor crunchy and they became soggy while we were sitting in the car.  Homicide wings - not \"extra hot\" as rated on their menu. It tasted like a medium spicy buffalo sauced wings, heavy on the vinegar.  Lemon pepper wings - were better tasting than the Homicide wings but the taste reminded me of the chicken wings I would buy at the grocery store in the freezer section and bake at home.  Blue cheese dip - sweet with a funny texture almost slimy.  In conclusion, everything tasted like it was previously frozen and just heated up. I hate giving low ratings but I gotta call it like it is. However, the friendly and helpful staff deserve 5 stars."}
{"text":"The wings are ok here.  I had combo # 2 with 30 wings and a large fries and 3 cans of pop....and an order of mozzarella sticks....plenty of food....wings were larger than some places ive been and pretty tasty."}
{"text":"I've been on a search for the best wings in Scarborough and this place takes it, hands down!  This past New Years Eve we decided to order wings and I found that this place was open until 10pm.  We found their site and menu online and I called to place my order.  The woman who took my order was very friendly and helped me understand their variety of sauces.  We decided on messy honey, terodactyl, and mesquite.  Our favourite was the messy honey (honey garlic with garlic parm sauce on top) but the other two were tasty as well.  For those wonderding, mesquite is a smokey bbq sauce and terodactyl is bbq with teriyaki sauce on top.  The wings were big, juicy and crispy on the outside.  They will let you split your sauces for a small additional fee and I say go for it to try all their different flavours.  Will definitely order from them again!"}
{"text":"Awesome delicious and pretty big wings, friend fly and quick staff, and good prices.  They had interesting flavours such as suicide & Texas homicide (which tastes good)..."}
