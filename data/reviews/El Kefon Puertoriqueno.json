{"text":"Authentic Puerto Rican  food with HUGE portions and cheap prices. Had beef stew with Spanish rice and some sort of meat pocket and all of it was delicious. Not a fancy place by any means..."}
{"text":"The food is ok. The portions are huge, the price is cheap. When I need a fix of comida tipica not cooked by my own hands - this is a relatively close-by good alternative. I wish there were more options in Lorain."}
{"text":"This was the jam to me! My puerto rican friend complained about the fatty bits in the pork. I got the beef and plantains and empanadas. Yum yum local lorain realness."}
{"text":"My sister used to live out this way and knows how I love my puerto rican food, suggested I try this place (thanks Alicia). Now she moved and lives near me, so I have no reason to go out to Lorain and therefore have not had any of my fix in a while. I was just saying how I'm going to make a special trip, since I have been disappointed with the overpriced and underwhelming puerto rican restaurants in Cleveland.  Lets talk food, the rice is great. I like my rice white, so I can dip it in some of the rich sauces your meat is served in. I love empanada's and the plantains (doused in garlic). I always, I mean always, get a side of the yucca or cassava. It is kind of like a potato, but is served with onions and red peppers and spanish olives. It is so moist and yummy and the flavor of the sauce and texture of the yucca is wonderful. I love their bacalao, spanish salt cod. It is served in a salad form and I only get this in small amounts and also pair it with a meat. I'm big on the pernil, spanish style pulled pork. Also, you cant go wrong with any of the meats. Pork, chicken, steak, beef stew, whatevers clever.   Just had to give El Kefon their props for making me miss them so. After having a few bad experiences on Detroit Rd and Fulton Rd in Cleveland, I really miss your affordable, filling and consistently divine offerings. I hope to see you soon El Kefon."}
{"text":"Had a craving and needed my fix!  I'm not sure why I haven't heard of El Kefon yet but, so glad I gave them a try.  It was as good as I hoped!  We had as much as we could... the chicken and pork, white and yellow rice, beans, empanadas, and ruellenos de papas.  Fantastic!  I'm confident to say 2nd best Puerto Rican cooking behind only Mrs. Camargo's kitchen in Brookpark!"}
{"text":"This place is exactly what I expected to walk into. Family run, authentic recipes, with super large portions.  This could easily be three reasonable meals.  I ordered the steak with beans and rice.  Flavor was good, but the salt kicked in after a few hours.  I would prefer if it were a bit spicier, but that's just me. I will  return next time I am in the neighborhood.  Five stars if the spice level goes up!"}
{"text":"Not as good as it used to be... Portions are smaller and quality has taken a nosedive.. Definitely do not get what you pay for anymore....pastaleos used to have lots of meat now they are all dough barely any meat....and they no longer accept credit cards"}
{"text":"The food is amazing, prices are good for the amount of food they serve. Delicious Puerto Rican food. The people are very friendly and the location is clean. We'll be back for more."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb! I am from NYC and have eaten lots of Puerto Rican homemade dishes. This place reminds me of all the girls I new from HS and College who made authentic Spanish dishes. It's a cash only place and the food is made fresh everyday. It's a no frills kind of restaurant. You can eat in or take it to go. The smells of steak and onions, plantains, yellow rice and beans fills the restaurant. I would eat here everyday if I could. The food is that good!"}
{"text":"You can hold up your nose and say this is a dive. You can knock the formica tables and the cheap plastic and foam containers used for serving. You can even decry the lack of decor. You cannot criticize the large portions of well seasoned Puerto Rican food. And you gotta love the owners.   We all know that it is best to go grocery shopping on a full stomach. Fortunately, El Kefon is a few doors down from Flignor's Market. Every time I want fresh Ohio meats from Flignor's I stop first at El Kefon. I always claim prices are so low at Flignor's that my total bill is surprisingly low. I suspect being so full from a platter of stewed chicken, yellow rice and red beans may have contributed to my disciplined cart.   I usually arrive at El Kefon near 1:00 PM and there is perpetual small line waiting at the counter. Food is already prepared and sits behind a glass partition. Either the husband or wife takes your order as well as the order of the next person or two. That way as they pass by the trays they can fill more than one order. I do not know how but they outfast fast food. You help yourself to canned sodas in a refrigerator. Most customers carry out their orders but I sit at one of the long tables in front of the window pouring on the homemade pepper sauce.   The menu is in Spanish so I either point to what I want or say chicken or beef or pork chop. I limit myself to what I see but some leave with steaks or other things that must be stored somewhere other than behind the glass. The pasteles seem to be the most popular item and fresh trays keep coming from the back. One of these days I will have to discover these other dishes. I know if I did not like what I eat here it would not be such a regular stop."}
{"text":"Wonderful food & huge portions at a low price. Great Puerto Rican food!"}
{"text":"Owner acts like we're bothering him, if he's the owner. Some well dressed people were in front of me, omg....he was SO different with serving them. He even gave them SAMPLES!  In all the years of just trying to patronize our Latino businesses, he's never treated my family with any hospitality!!  Food is mediocre.... nothing to write home about. Don't use bathroom, like most people, a clean bathroom & clean windows says alot about ANY restaurant!!! Yuck..... This \"restaurant\" has so much to be desired!  #unsatisfiedcustomer"}
{"text":"Got this place today when I was on my lunch break. In a sketchy place but very nice inside. Modern, with tv screens showing food items, an aquarium and hot fresh food. The only thing that made it not a 5/5 in my book was that there was no menu, You had to either see the special sign outside or know exactly what you wanted, and they had a sign that said they had coffee but there was none. Very little English was spoken but this did not matter, everyone I saw was happy to get the food they enjoyed. Now for the food. Greasy(which I could care less about) and fall off the one delicious. Huge portions. I will definitely be back again. Guess I will just have to teach myself some Spanish"}
{"text":"El Kefon is an Amazing Puerto Rican Restaurant! The portions are out of this world for the price. The family that owns the restaurant are friendly and social. There's seating inside if you want the dining in experience. The only down side is that there's only a few vegetarian options. Otherwise, this is a great place for someone who loves meats of all kinds."}
{"text":"Went on two different Sunday's, both times they were closed.   The store hours on their window shows that they are open till 5:00 on Sundays."}
{"text":"It's OK but they don't use enough seasoning for it to be authentic.  I mean Puerto Rican rice and beans is orange and it has gondules but they don't add them.  Just plain Jane rice and skimp on the sazon.  Everything is way over cooked and doesn't have a lot of flavor.  I mean it's OK in a pinch if your favorite Puerto Rican mom isn't cooking but there are way better restaurants out there.  This is just mediocre."}
{"text":"If you want a  styrofoam container full of lukewarm food-borne illness then this place is for you.   I saw grease everywhere! It was revolting!  Combine that with the cooks smoking cigarettes while cooking and you have a trip to Mercy Hospital coming."}
