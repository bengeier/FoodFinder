{"text":"Great place for anything Asian-- sushi, sashimi, chinese you name it. Food is very flavorful. Megan Stone is great. Our server Jenn was flustered a bit at the start. Got me the wrong beer and wrong sashimi dish as well. As the evening progressed, she showed a bit of humor. Drunken fish very tasty. Seaweed salad another winner."}
{"text":"It's the best in medina.  Fresh food. Great service and love the new management    You must try a drink from the bar."}
{"text":"Hu's House?  RUN'S HOUSE!!!  Man, that never stops being funny to me. \"Hu House,\" as it's affectionately called by those in the know (probably just me), is a pretty dang solid dine-in Chinese restaurant for Akronites and Fairlawnians alike. More of a pay-a-few-bucks-extra-and-dine-in kind of place than a quick takeout joint, the restaurant sports a comfy/classy interior and provides excellent service. The food is good and the quality is very consistent. They also have sushi. It's not the greatest sushi, but it's definitely respectable."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since my mom was  pregnant with me. While I generally love the food I was disappointed when the server told me there is no more egg foo young.....guess I'll have to start going to Cleveland or make it myself."}
{"text":"It's about as good as you are gonna get in Medina as far as Asian food. It's a stylish space with moderate pricing (especially lunch hour carryout.) Most dishes are a couple notches above standard carry out. They also offer sushi which is nothing great, but it's at least comparable to Shinto, which is popular in Strongsville up the road.   One downfall is their lo-mein. I tried it twice and was let down.  Overall, it's pretty good for the price. Combine that with the nice decor, and charming location in Medina Square, and you have a pretty nice place to get some Chinese food."}
{"text":"This restaurant was nice and clean and the hostess was friendly.  My waitress was obviously frazzled or frustrated or what have you, but was friendly enough when I asked questions. As far as Chinese food goes, it was good.  I thought the Gyoza (fried dumpling appetizer) was actually pretty good.   The water and green tea had an odd flavor to it, so I didn't drink much during my meal which was inconvenient. I ordered the peach schnapps chicken with no spice which ended up being fine, just nothing special. Didn't taste any peachiness. Just a basic breaded chicken dish at any chinese place. My major complaint actually is that the chicken pieces are small so you're really getting way too much breading and little chicken. Portion size is fine though. Bottom line: Ok, standard food. I'd try it again and get something else but I'm not in any hurry to get back there. I'll be seeing what else is around before I go back."}
{"text":"After seeing wait and cook staff behind the restaurant throwing \"snot rockets\", wiping their noses, and then wiping on their aprons, I just could not find it in me to step a foot in that place again.  While some of the food is okay, what I had wasn't that tasty.  I asked for spicy in my dish and it barely tasted like they added anything.  The interior is nice and the doors open to the square, very nice touch.   If I could give them a zero I would...just for lack of being clean.  Just plain gross."}
{"text":"Not really a Chinese restaurant, but an Asian restaurant that serves selected Chinese, Thai and Sushi dishes.  Late on a weekday afternoon I sampled from the dinner menu. I tried the hot and sour soup. Most of the hot seasoning was on one side of the bowl. I had to finish mixing it up.  The pot stickers were not inspired either: tough and overdone.  The atmosphere was comfortable: dark and good for conversation. The service was excellent.  House of Hunan left me longing for the Chinese restaurants of Northern California."}
{"text":"Price gouging at its finest. My son took his girlfriend there for lunch today. She ordered an eight dollar lunch item and asked for a side of sweet-and-sour sauce to flavor her rice. The charge for the sauce was four dollars. This was more than my son's egg rolls. So her $8 lunch became $12. Nothing was said about the extra charge when she asked for it. Be careful for this crappy way to make more money.    Food is good but this sucked.  No different than if McDonalds charged $4 for ketchup to go with the fries."}
{"text":"Great food and very friendly staf... Clean and comforting ambience... Do try their 3 Cup Chicken!!!"}
{"text":"I went here last time I visited family to get sushi and loved it so I knew I had to return again.  House of Hunan is located right on the Medina Square and is quite modern and decoration is clean and simple. Staff are friendly and helpful, able to make recommendations on dishes to try.  On my first visit, at dinner time, I asked the waitress for her recommendation of sushi and ended up ordering that (It was one of the Halloween sushi rolls, I believe it is called the Spooky roll or something like that) along with some fried rice to share with the others. Hands down, this was the best sushi roll I've ever had!!! I've also heard the On the Square roll is also highly recommended.  For my second visit I dined during the lunch hour. I ordered one of the bento boxes (vegetarian and my boyfriend the chicken) and we both really liked them! it comes with soup, sushi, meat/veggie and is quite filling. A great bargain in my opinion! We also ordered some tea to share, which warmed us up during a cold winter's day.  Although more pricey, it is definitely worth the visit as you get good quality sushi at House of Hunan! Go during lunch if you have a craving but are lacking in the budget!"}
{"text":"My family and I decided to go to House of Hunan for dinner last night and it was amazing!  My Mom and sister split the Sweet and Sour Shrimp, I got the same dish and my daughter got Cashew Chicken.  We hasn't been there for a few years and the food tasted better than I ever remembered!  We will be going back again soon!"}
{"text":"I just went there for lunch and was handed a very limited lunch menu.  I was disappointed because I wanted spring rolls and one of the items I like on the regulars menu.  I had moo goo gai pan that was bland and the meat was like mush.  Tasted like it was soaked in msg.  I live in Medina and won't go back.  Such a cute place though."}
{"text":"We went to House of Hunan in Medina for dinner.  What a horrible experience.  We were seated at a table that was very wobbly, which ruins the dining experience.  My wife ordered sweet and sour shrimp.  Most of her item was heavily breaded.  The shrimp was not deveined, and cold.  Also, the \"stir fried vegetables\" i.e. green peppers were cold, soggy and uncooked.  The only thing good about the dish was the sauce.  I think they were hoping that no one will notice how bad the food will taste if they sauce the heck out of everything.  My dish was ok...I ordered the general tso's chicken.  It was NOT better than any take out Chinese food.   Our waitress looked like she didn't care at all.  Very poor service, and she only came back once to fill water.  I would save your money and go somewhere else.  We will not be back, ever."}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill, and the food I had tonight was barely edible.  I used to love their food.  The moo goo gai pan consisted of soft rubbery chicken floating in a tasteless sauce.  It tasted as if water had been added--it didn't taste of chicken, garlic, onion, or anything that would have enhanced the flavor.  The fried rice had no taste--or eggs, peas, or anything else.  I'm seriously thinking about not going back, and this has been a favorite restaurant for years.   The waitress admitted that she knew I like extra sauce and that's why she brought it that way (but I did not request extra sauce).  If I had, it should have been more of a savory sauce and not water added to make more sauce.  Disgusting and flavorless!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat for dinner. Only 3 stars because I ordered sushi pick up twice and the order was wrong both times. So stick with dine in and skip the pick up."}
{"text":"The pad thai is incredible. They give you a giant plate and the service is great. I always try to come here when visiting. The best in Akron."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing!! The sushi is phenomenal- the Angry Dragon, Nemo, & Empire are some of our favorite rolls. The previous reviews are completely wrong- they do not use tuna paste- the rolls are huge, fresh, & delicious!! For dinner you have to try the Khing Curry, the Chicken Pot, & the Mongolian Beef... The entire place has been remodeled with a beautiful bar and foyer, the staff is amazing between Megan at the bar for $5 martini night (every Saturday!!) and Josh the GM recommending amazing wines to go with your dinner!! It all comes together for a fantastic dining experience- one word sums it up, Yum!!"}
{"text":"We eat at Hunan enough that the entire staff knows us.  My kids and I would eat the sushi multiple times per week if we could.  We have had sushi in major cities around the country (and abroad) and we have yet to taste better than Hunan."}
{"text":"for starters..I almost fell on my rear entering. seated a little slow. waitress acted like we were inconveniencing her. bathrooms were disgusting. food was average. for filet of beef for $13, I expected more. tasted more like a food court meal. manager acknowledged the front door problem and brushed it off as a tile problem. not a solution. I didn't feel welcome and probably will never go back."}
{"text":"Pretty good place to nosh in funky cold medina.   I had the sushi - especially enjoyed the tempura crispy kind.  My frenemy whom I was dining with that night had some sort of veggie and tofu stir fry offering which looked delish as well.   The drinks were cold and refilled often which was optimal since I was pretty parched.    Restaurant is swank, comfy cushions in the booths, cool little waterfall pyramid thingy... I felt way undressed in my sweatshirt and yoga \"sexy\" pants.    The highlight of the meal was our waiter... Mike Carlson.  He had brown tousled hair, which I just wanted to run my fingers through, dorky yet sexy glasses and a cute pixie-like nose.  Carlson was very attentive as a server - very hunky as a man - a total dreamboat.    Now my dining partner even has a crush on him ... (sigh) I guess we are going to remain frenemies."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere since remodel. Great sushi and cocktails.  Nightly drink specials are great! King curry is awesome as well. This is a favorite in our families repertoire!"}
{"text":"Came in today for lunch. I've been coming here for about 4 years and never have had a bad meal. The last time I was here was in October and it just wasn't up to par with the last times I've had it:/ but today at lunch was the last straw. I ordered hot and sour soup which is always good and the beef and broccoli lunch special and the sesame seed chicken. When the lunches were both brought to the table one was beef and broccoli and the other Szechwan chicken. I told the waiter that I had gotten sesame chicken but he said this was it and left abruptly. I've had sesame chicken 4 times there and it wasn't. He came back once again and I told him sesame chicken is fried with a sweet sauce and has SESAMES on it! He proceeded to say it doesn't and he was correct it was sesame. When getting the bill too it was listed as Szechwan. The waiter was named Joe or John. But I'm never going back after the waiter was trying to take advantage of me."}
{"text":"3 stars because my husbands dish was very tasty - peach chicken. 2 stars for service- wait was entirely to long to get our appetizers and  meals for a week night. The place wasn't packed from Ordering to finally getting out food was exactly a hour. Our waitress wasn't the most happy person either. You can get a better dinner for  $60 somewhere else."}
{"text":"Was nice and clean but the food was average and not memorable. A bit overpriced but the restaurant was comfortable."}
{"text":"I don't understand the negative reviews. One of the best Chinese food we ever had, a new favorite! The servings are huge. My sesame chicken had actual chicken breasts in it. The fried rice, beef with broccoli, and orange chicken are great too. Orange chicken is not spicy, but I can not eat spicy food, so I was happy with that. Best egg rolls I've had. Also love that the take out comes with oolong tea, a nice touch."}
{"text":"Ordered out for delivery last night and was served with THE BEST shrimp fried rice I've ever had. Colorful, fresh and delicious. Plus the \"delivery guy\" was 15 minutes early and dressed like a host.   Awesome service and awesome food. I am definitely going to try the dining room next time!"}
{"text":"Cooks never washed their hands even once in the two years I worked there. Two times I saw one in particular pick his nose and then put his hands on the food. Waiting staff did nothing but talk trash and make fun of every table they had. Morale here is damaged. I witnessed first hand a fist fight break out between two of the cooks. The dishwasher at the time who is one of the only decent people in the staff got BIT when he tried to break it up. The owner and management's final decision on the incident was to, and I quote, \"Let them finish it outside. No one go out and get in the middle\". There were food items used in dishes that I knew for certain had been in the cooler for months at a time. I could go on and on. The one cook used to bring prostitutes into the restaurant when he wasn't on the clock. You can't make this stuff up."}
{"text":"Great meal for myself and 3 others. I had their interpretation of the bird's nest and the seafood was fresh and delicious. The won ton soup wasn't that great ..colder than I would have liked and more of a beef rather than chicken base. Generous portions. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Oh House of Hunan Your food is tasty Your location is neat Medina Square? It can't be beat! People might ask me why .... Six words. Fun glasses ... Filled with Mai Tais.  Publc service announcement:   Don't steal the Mai Tai glasses.  Buy them."}
{"text":"I recently moved to the Akron area from Chicago, and this restaurant has become my new favorite for take-out. My husband and I are vegetarians, and the offerings at House of Hunan are great! The food has consistently been fresh and flavorful. They also know how to prepare tofu properly."}
{"text":"I will keep this short n sweet. Took 35 min for waitress to bring us our drinks. Only because she was the only one working, at first i thought it was poor service. Come to find it was poor management, or i should say lack of. Only one waitress when we sat down, with eight tables occupied, and the pip-squeek so called mngr is sitting at a table drinking wine. The only time i saw him off his ass was when he got up to make him and the people he was  drinking with with shots. The food was good, but going in there for a quick lunch during a shopping day with a friend turned into a two hour nightmare. As for the pip-squeek, he should turn in his so called title, and go back to the frat house, since drinking was his priority tonight."}
{"text":"Good and Bad.  On a positive the food was excellent.  The negative, the greeting staff is horrible.  Upon entering we gave our last name which apparently was the wrong thing to do.  The gentlemen corrected us by telling us he needed a 1st name.  Really?  For a buzzer  a last name is not sufficient.  The young lady who then lead us to our table DID NOT speak one word!   We assumed when she started walking away with the menus that we were to follow her.  After seating us and still not speaking she basically shoved the menus 6 inches from our faces and walked away. A real charmer that gal."}
{"text":"For a chain Asian restaurant in suburban Ohio, it's not bad.  The Chinese food seems a little heavy on the MSG, but I've been happy with the appetizers and the Thai dishes.  The spicy dishes are genuinely spicy.  On several occasions, I've asked if I could substitute tofu for chicken in a dish, and every time it was done.  Furthermore, the tofu was always properly fried and cooked.  Hooray!"}
{"text":"Wow has this place gone down hill !!   This used to be one of the great places in NE Ohio for Asian food and esp sushi/sashimi.  5 rolls 1 sushi and  minced chicken lettuce wraps and pad thai later I am devasted.   Tuna roll was PASTE tuna !!!  Salmon sushi was frozen.  Rolls had virtually NO FISH in them.   Best of food was C-    Worst was inedible.  Tuna paste in the roll was shocking.    I have had much better from a grocery store - and I don't think grocery sushi is sushi.    All the more shocking because this place used to be the best.   Very sad.  I would never come back.   I strongly suggest you learn from my sad experience  Final touch.   They tried to charge us for a roll we did not order and did not eat !!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in the Cleveland Akron area hands down. The Futomaki rolls are gigantic sized and excellent fresh quality. The rolls are bigger than any sushi place I've ever visited across the US including NYC and San Francisco. My friend and I have girls nights here and we always enjoy the food. Beef fried rice is also excellent, the beef is soft like butter. The service could be better in terms of more friendly and attentive waiters. They are slow, don't bring refills of water or mixed drinks or ask if you want dessert which is only going to hurt business, however, it won't stop me from coming here. I adore their sushi."}
{"text":"My family went here for dinner. We have heard lots of good thing about the best Chinese restaurant in town. As we stepped in, the tall hostess didn't even crack a smile.  She was even wearing super high heels, towering over people. Stuck up was spelled across her forehead. My husband ordered Khing chicken, which was ok. Mine was Gulf of Siam, a combination of variety seafood. Food was very bland, not a typical Thai food at all. Since there was no kick of spice to my dish, I asked for some sriracha to help the food taste a little better.  Guess what? We were charged $1 for this. I have been eating at restaurants  all over, north, south, east, west but I never heard of being charged for hot sauce at a semi fancy restaurant. Overall, service was ok and the food wasn't all that great. You just have to deal with Snoddy attitudes when you eat here."}
{"text":"I have been here several times and have come to the conclusion that the sushi is wonderful and the cooked food is ok.  My friend and I visit at least 1/month, so you would think I would have better things to say, but alas, I think we do this more out of habit than love. This time I ordered sushi (Key West Maki and JJ Maki) and a salad with ginger dressing. The sushi was WONDERFUL!! the ginger dressing was like chewing on raw ginger root. If you like sweet/citrus ginger dressing, DO NOT order this. You will be disappointed.  We were there no longer than usual, but our waiter was a little too helpful. He began by trying to talk my friend out of her meal choice, which we both thought was  incredibly odd. He then went on the critic other items on the menu and inform us of items food critics did not enjoy. Once again, we thought this whole conversation was odd; not helpful. BTW, she loved her meal (something with shrimp and pineapple)! We really love the decore and the items we always order (I, sushi; she, General Tso). Those items are definately what keep us coming back. Side note- If you have small children, make sure you are not seated by the waterfall and they do NOT have a children's menu."}
{"text":"I would never eat here again.  The General Tso chicken was the worst I ever had.  The chicken was pounded out and the breading was way to thick and burnt.  The sauce tasted bland."}
{"text":"It honestly pains me to have to even give this place one star. While I have never eaten here I NEVER will. On Saturday I parked in an open lot behind this location. The lot had a 4 hour time limit. After the 3 hours that I was at the square I returned to my car only to find a big truck parked behind me. The spot next to me was open and I figured I could easily maneuver my car through this spot without having to have the truck owner move. As I was getting into my car 2 men came out of the restaurant one wearing a chef jacket and the other was the truck owner, presumably an employee also. The truck guy starts screaming at me asking why I would ever think it's okay to park where I was parked or try to leave the spot without getting him first. I explained my thought process to which I was told was \"pretty stupid.\" The chef then came up to my passenger window and asked me where I was while I was gone. I told him I didn't feel like that was his business and he kept asking. I told him I was at cool beans and he replied \"not for that long you weren't.\" I rolled up my window and the truck was moved all the while the owner of the truck was in the cab throwing his arms in the air and screaming some more. I'm not sure in what world it is okay to try to intimidate someone that wasn't doing anything wrong, let alone a young woman that's by herself. Harassment is never okay and was the last thing I expected on a Saturday afternoon in the Medina square. I will tell everyone I know not to ever go to this restaurant again!"}
{"text":"Everything here is amazing.  Definitely worth the price.  I like the idea of fresh meats and fish rather than some hard alley dog served at most Chinese restaurants.  One item that I cannot live without is the tuna avacado salad. So good!  The service here is amazing even when you call in.  They are very personable and helpful. I like that not only do they have your traditional American Chinese food but thai and Japanese options.  They also have delivery which is huge.  Never been dissatisfied.  The sushi is also very good."}
{"text":"I was looking for decent Chinese food in Akron since moving here from Boston a few months ago. I am happy to say that I have found it at House of Hunan.   I ordered the crab rangoon or as they call it \"crab with cheese\". Doesn't sounds as appetizing to me but they were still pretty delicious. I also ordered General Tso's Chicken. I know, I know, I order the most basic and Americanized crap available...anyway...judge away. It was delicious. I am looking forward to coming back when I have a craving.   The restaurant itself is pretty nice and very clean. Our waiter was very nice and attentive. We did go here on a Saturday afternoon and ordered off the lunch menu. I ordered the small(lunch) portion of the crab with cheese thingies but they brought us the must larger much more expensive dinner serving. I can't complain about that too much."}
{"text":"House of Hunan has been one of my favorite Northeastern Ohio Asian restaurants for many years now.  I have had the pleasure of sampling a wide array of items on their menu.  In over 20 years, I have never had a bad meal at any of their locations (2 Locations also in Akron, Ohio), including this one which is my favorite.  The food not only is always fresh, and has a very balanced flavor, but it is also presented very well, and often has a certain elegance about it.  Their won ton soup is exceptional!  If you like Pad Thai, it's definitely worth having here.  Also, I recommend the Empress Chicken if you want something slightly sweet, but tangy too.  I would also like to mention that I live about 45 minutes away from House of Hunan, but I will make an extra effort when I am in the area to make sure to stop in for lunch, or dinner.    In regard to service, I have noticed that their service staff does seem to change frequently.  However, I have enjoyed good service there over the years regardless of the size of my party, or whether it was during lunch, or dinner.  The dining room has a trendy, Zen inspired Asian design.  I would describe it as leaning towards a casual, but slightly more upscale type of ambiance which is suitable for a date, or just a casual get-together with friends and/or family.  In warmer weather, they often open the large sliding panel windows that look out onto the square, and if you are fortunate enough to have a table in the bar are, the people watching can be both entertaining and quite comfortable.    House of Hunan is definitely worth experiencing for yourself if you enjoy casual, but full-service Asian dining with a comfortable, Zen-like vibe."}
{"text":"Good food, but prices are driving us to search for other options. Sad to say, but when we ordered from last summer's menu & saw our total go from $65 to $88 we were SHOCKED!!! Good was good, but not good enough for such a HUGE price increase. No wonder the restaurant wasn't busy @ 6:30pm when we picked up our order. Sad..."}
{"text":"The food here is great, but don't trust their online orders or their delivery service. They have 1 driver, so the wait time every time we've called is 1 to 1 1/2 hours.   I'll spare you the long description of this whole ordering process. Mistakes happen in any business, but what them apart is how a manager deals with a mistake when it happens!   We just ordered a simple order through their website, and when we got home with it it was all wrong. We called and spoke to a manager who gave us a bunch of unrealistic explanations of how it got so wrong, instead of just taking responsibility for their website and their mistakes!   Instead of saying \"Keep the dish you didn't order, and I'm going to send someone out with your missing orders right now\", they made my wife drive back (20 minutes both ways) to pick up the missing orders and final kicker: bring back the order of shrimp fried rice that we didn't order... Really?!   We might go there in person again, but it's the last time we try to make our night relaxing by ordering from here.   I'm still hoping they'll come back with some kind of redeeming story, but I doubt it. If they do, I'll update."}
{"text":"Oh! So that's how a spicy tuna roll is supposed to taste! Nori that's not rubber, perfect rice, spice that accents rather than overwhelming the fish... The Love Boat for 4-6 plus one large roll filled the four of us amply. We each chose one the four different soups, and we were all very pleased.   We made a reservation for the tatami tables, a nice touch for a long meal. The higher walls around the section kept out some of the background noise from the full house.   The Green Tea ice cream was delicious and portioned so large that two of us couldn't finish. I was not one of them.  We had very pleasant, non-rushed, service throughout our 2:45 minute meal.   Thanks for a lovely evening."}
{"text":"Went on our 2 year anniversary.  Sushi is awesome, I wanted to try the duck which was suggested by our waiter.  The sushi when it came was colorful and was wonderful.  My wife and I loved the sushi and she was full after her 2 rolls that she ordered.  When my duck came it smelled great, but that was about it.  The duck was chewy and lacked a great plum/spicy flavor.  Some of the duck was very chewy and some pieces where way over cooked and crunchy.  When the waiter asked what I though of the meal he suggested I told him that the duck was not all that great and he apologized.  Overall the meals where good, the atmosphere is nice, tables are clean, staff is nice, and a great location for a summer night stroll or winter night stroll for some coffee if your bundle up."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant.  I live in Columbus which has a lively food scene and I just can't find anything that compares.  The wonton soup is delicious and I love to pot stickers and the dipping sauce is amazing."}
{"text":"So I must say, I am insanely disappointed in House of Hunan. I always make it a point to eat there every time I am in town. Usually each experience has been pretty good. However, my mom and I ordered take out a couple of nights ago. While we were eating the \"minced chicken and lettuce\" she got a piece of metal in the chicken mixture. It was so disgusting, not to mention she is lucky she didn't break a tooth. We couldn't even bring ourselves to finish the meal we had ordered. Skip forward to today (Friday 4/05) and I decided to give them another chance to redeem themselves. (Plus I was craving sushi and I had heard decent reviews.) So I ordered a nothing special avocado roll, a California roll, and an order of edamame. So I went to pick it up and brought the receipt from the previous night (along with the piece of metal) and mentioned that this was in our chicken the other night. The hostess (white male) simple said \"oh yeah, the cooks clean the woks after every order with a stainless steel brush and that happens sometimes.\" Not so much as even an apology. I wasn't expecting anything out of this ordeal other than an apology and making sure it doesn't happen to some other poor person who may actually break their tooth... Ok so bad to the sushi that I ordered today... By far the WORST sushi I have ever eaten (and come on it's a freaking avocado and California roll, how hard is that to mess up?!?!) so for beginners, I ordered the sushi to be made with soy paper (which they charged me $2 extra for... Really?! I just moved back from Columbus where I are sushi ALL of the time and they never charged for this and I always had amazing sushi which was also not as pricey.) then they jammed a bunch of nasty pickled ginger in the to go container so the entire row that was next to it tastes like disgusting pickled ginger. Next the rice was so incredibly awful... It was so sweet. Which could only mean it is so insanely processed (yay!!) Do dispite those two issues, I was starving so I attempted to eat a piece or two, which proceeded to completely fall apart. I'm pretty sure I can roll sushi better than they can... I was so ridiculously disappointed with the entire experience. I do not think I can bring myself to spend another dollar there again. Pretty bad customer service coupled with metal pieces and crappy food? No thanks!"}
{"text":"I just went to House of Hunan for the first time yesterday. I heard from some friends it is a cool place with great food. I went with a couple friends and we had to wait for a table to clear for about ten minutes before we were seated. Mostly our fault it was packed on a Saturday afternoon. My initial impression was a good one, the place had a cool layout with Asian decor, a minor complaint was I wish they had more booths and tables.   The menu had a good amount of variety: Sushi, fried pork and chicken meals, tofu, and a lot more. Our dishes were fantastic and didn't take long at all to bring out. Each of our dishes came with a side of rice of our choice but no egg rolls. I had honey walnut chicken, came out hot and could tell was made with love and not thrown together carelessly, which was fantastic. At the end the bill was $60 for three people, which included the sides, drinks and dinner. I think it was a bit pricy, so do keep that in mind if you want to come here.  In all The House of Hunan is indeed a very nice place to come and try if you want something new. But you may end up with a larger bill than expected, so this may not necessarily be a place to go to every weekend but more a once in a while type place."}
{"text":"Very nice find in downtown medina.  The decor is very feng shui.  Plenty of options in the menu including Chinese and sushi.  We had the tuna/avocado and spicy tuna roll for an appetizer.  Both very tasty.  I had the red curry entree - also very good."}
{"text":"Would love to love this place...great location (sushi in the burbs?) and atmosphere but overall its meh.  The disappointment starts at the front door when the overweight, grumpy, disinterested manager greets you with a less than enthusiastic hello.    You MAY get a great waiter...or NOT.  I've had both here.  Generally, the sushi is good, if overpriced. The cooked food, not so good,  and still overpriced.  Too bad they no longer have half price sushi Tuesdays OR a Happy Hour - a 50/50 shot at good food and service was worth the gamble then, but we no longer patronize this place. If we are hoping for good sushi we hit up Sushi on the Roll just down the street."}
{"text":"we don't live in Akron, but come to Akron every three months or so. every time, we visit Akron, we always order food/ eat in  from House of Hunan. It is one of my favorite places to have Chinese food in Akron, Ohio. Last time, we ate here and I ordered a Bento dinner ( a Japanese dish). It was good as well."}
{"text":"I had the \"Peking duck\" half. Those \"traditional Chinese pancakes\" were nothing more than tortillas I could of gotten from Walmart. As for the duck, it was okay but nothing worth $17 even after you put everything together. The meat was cooked decently but all together the dish isn't worth what you get. I fear what the $31/whole has to offer honestly."}
{"text":"I haven't ever got a great vibe from the managers on duty that are at the front to greet you as you first walk in the door - at least seem a little enthused about being there.  However, don't get too hung up on that as the atmosphere and location are great being right on the square in an older building.  The Sushi is always consistent and VERY tasty, VERY fresh.  Check this place out, it won't disappoint"}
{"text":"Always a great meal, delicious & happy friendly service.  Wonderful wonton soup and miso soup.  Prefer the spring roll o egg roll, we've been coming here for 15+ years & it never disappoints."}
{"text":"Quality Chinese, Thai, vegetarian, & sushi choices.  Familiar restaurant ambiance and it is often full of patrons. This time we sat waaay in the back. I did not realize it went so far back. Great chicken dishes, good dumplings, and very good beef with broccoli.  Service is good, food is fresh and satisfying, and the price is fair value."}
{"text":"Order the Asian Pear martini and the Hawaiian Roll. The Hawaiian roll is unlike any sushi roll I've ever had! It was so delicious and only $13!  The inside of the restaurant is beautiful!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere that is only exceeded by the food. Quality light Chinese food that makes you want to keep coming back for more. Waitstaff was very knowledgeable and helpful"}
{"text":"The best place I have been to for sushi in Ohio. If you go for dinner on the weekends, the person that knows how to make the \"tomato roll\" is there (raw tuna wrapped around crab, mango, avocado, and maybe spicy shrimp). Otherwise, you can't go wrong with the New York City roll. Thai coconut soup is very good, too."}
{"text":"We went for lunch once when they first opened here in Medina, and we only remember being not overly impressed and did not go back. Years later, we were curious, because we have seen good reviews for them. We ordered carryout to give them another chance. The lo mein was bland. The fried dumplings contained a pink meat mixture that was also bland, and the sauce that came with the dumplings was disappointing. We are used to dumpling sauce being gingery, and this was just soy and ?? I don't know what. The Singapore noodles, described on the menu as having a yellow curry, included surprise ingredients that were not included on the otherwise very detailed description, eggs and mushrooms of some sort. I suppose we should always ask about mushrooms since I am averse to them and you never know when a chef will add them to something. Anyway, I don't think we'll try again."}
{"text":"Clean, efficient, good food in Medina. Great booths! - nice back support.  MUCH better than the Fairlawn location."}
{"text":"Two people told me about this place. Who are these people? What are their stories? The first, my dear, dear mother, who's lived her entire life in Kentucky, Ohio and Florida. The other was a friend of a friend (you know, Brandon) who lived in New York for about a decade. They both recommended the House of Hunan in Medina.  I cannot complain about the quality of the food, the service, the atmosphere or the prices. I'll be back.  I ordered the egg rolls to start. Two in an order. They came out fast and were cut in half - smart. This way you don't burn your tongue on the first bite, ruining the rest of your meal. Crunchy and light - really, no grease at all. They might be my new favorites. They came with two dipping sauces: what looked to be a homemade duck sauce and also our old friend hot mustard.   Next, I ordered the standard spicy tuna roll. Big pieces compared to some sushi places. These guys didn't even think about falling apart either. Nicely rolled and tasty, with the right amount of pickled, pink ginger.  I almost ordered the scallops for my entree, but the server said I'd like my choice from the Thai menu better. So I got the Bangkok Galaxy. It had a very good blend of sweet and spicy with the coconut milk just giving it a little smoothness. The veggies were cooked well, not overdone and the pork, chicken and steak were very tender.  I have to get back over there sometime. Highly recommend this place for a date or just getting some sushi with friends."}
{"text":"Great sushi. I had the salmon and tuna sashimi. I also had the blackened tuna roll which was awesome. My wife had the dragon roll and it was good too."}
{"text":"The Food has not always been that good. My parents went their on valentines day or something and The food was awful, messed up on the order, waited and waited for the food, Some nights the food is good other night the food is not.  good."}
{"text":"Colleagues of mine decided on House of Hunan for lunch as they are fans of the restaurant.  The restaurant itself is very nice and has a modern and zen feel to it.  The menu includes Chinese and Japanese selections.  I opted for the beef and broccoli and one of my colleagues ordered a sushi roll.  My dish had a good sauce but I was disappointed in the quality of the beef - there was a lot of gristle.  I also did not care for the fried rice.    I have to comment on the service because I was very impressed with the server.  Our server had excellent manners and served us very well and in a timely manner.  That was the thing that made the best impression about this restaurant for me.  I was also surprised on how affordable our lunch was.     Overall, I think House of Hunan is a good option if you are in the mood for Asian food with a good variety of menu items."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised to have good sushi and Asian food in this part of the country. My favorite was one of the sea bass dishes I had. Sushi selections are limited; however they were very fresh. Looking forward to going back when I make it back to Seville."}
{"text":"Overall: Overhyped and subpar. I've eaten here at least a dozen times in the past as a result of group dinners. It has been permanently removed from my list of places to go for sushi or Chinese food in the Akron area.  Food: Overpriced but poor quality. The fish used in the Chirashi and sushi rolls is old (but can be masked with copious amounts of ginger and soy sauce). Chinese dishes are Americanized, sweet, not cooked at the right temperature for the right amount of time, and lack any balance; your local hole-in-the-wall Chinese takeout place can do better for half the price. Quality and portion sizes do not match the price.  Service: It was acceptable until the last time I went. I had a server who pretended he was French and spoke to us in a French accent the entire meal. I studied French for over 7 years, have traveled to France, and assisted French people in previous jobs; I know what a real French accent sounds like. It was very annoying.  Atmosphere: While this may seem counterintuitive, the restaurant was nice and clean, which is typically a big red flag that you're going to an Americanized Chinese joint. You're paying for decor and native English-speaking servers, not good Chinese food."}
{"text":"Probably the best Chinese food I've ever had.  Their lo mein and General Tao's chicken are amazing.  They also have some of the fastest delivery I've ever seen."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the food. Fisrt of all for delivery you have to order a minimum of $15.00 plus a $2.00 delivery fee, no problem of the food was worth it. The sushi was horrible, used tuna paste instead of real tuna, the pieces were huge and poorly done. The eggs rolls were the worse I ever had. The pork lo mein was decent, egg rolls were terrible. Would not eat from here again."}
{"text":"I will preface this review with the fact that I prefer authentic Chinese food. I was expecting Hunan style and spicy; very disappointing in the spicy level. Also the food was very Americanized. It was a little better than the American Chinese food at PF Changs, but not great if you are looking for real Chinese food"}
{"text":"This is Out new Asian go to place.  Fusion.  I had peach schnapps chicken.    OMG.  Like orange chicken w a twist.    Not real peachy.  Chicken was little strips fried.   I loved it.    Also had mu shu pork.   Better than we have found in Cleveland.     We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Quality of food in no way matches the over priced menu.  Not kid friendly. Service was awful yet 18% was included in the bill. Never eating here again."}
{"text":"Visited the House of Hunan in Medina more times than I can count. Always have great sushi but tonite (feb 8) was the absolute best we have ever had. Don't know if they have a new chef or cuz of Year of the Snake celebration, but it was excellent!!!"}
{"text":"If you like good sushi then this is the restaurant for you! I can't enjoy sushi anywhere else since I've had the sushi here.   All of their appetizers are delicious whether you go with the wonton soup, the edamame, the vegetable spring rolls...I've had them all and they are amazing.   My boyfriend always goes with the Empire roll, I however love spicy tune and hot food so I always order the JJ roll which comes topped with two different hot sauces.   The service is always quick and friendly and the casual atmosphere with top-notch sushi is perfect."}
{"text":"I haven't been back to this place since I was young. It definitely change a lot, but the decor and atmosphere was nice. My girlfriend and I split the Salmon Bites as an appetizer. It was delicious. Fresh salmon wrapped around sweet potato and covered in a sweet and sour type sauce. My girlfriend got the Empire Roll as her entrée. The presentation was nice and it tasted great. I got the King Curry. Definitely good, but would be better with avocado. We got the fried bananas for dessert and I would recommend those, too. Overall it was delicious food and a good experience. The service could be better, but that didn't bother me very much."}
{"text":"Tried House of Hunan for the first time. Ordered for to go. Hostess is really friendly and helpful. 5 stars for her.  On to food. Ordered Peking Duck, Satuteed string beans and Beef Ho fun. Where do i begin?  Peking Duck was not freshly cooked. Which is fine, since freshly cooked duck takes a long time. However, that duck i had was so stale that the skin wasnt crispy and the meat was so dry that it's falls apart when you pick it up.  Duck is not suppose to fall apart when you pick it up.  Satuteed string beans. Was so stale. Very oily, salty and lots of MSG.   Beef Ho Fun. Very Salty, Sweet. And Oily.   Spicy Seafood soup and vietnam cold noodle. Basically the same soupbase with different condiments. And the Vietnam cold noodle wasnt cold noodle at all. Maybe i have different understanding from vietnam cold noodle. But i know for sure that the soup base in the vietnam cold noodle included Japanese Hondashi. Which is a Japanese dried fish seasoning MSG. Honestly, i doubt vietnamese uses Hondashi in their food. And if it's not vietnamese, don't advertise it as vietnam cold noodle.  All in all, being chinese and having this food, very highly disappointed. All the oil in all of my food, really makes me wonder whether the oil was on sale and it's about to go bad. Will be my one and only time going there."}
{"text":"2.5 hours.  Thats how we were there from the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out.  The upside is that the sushi was super and we didn't have anywhere to be, the downside...we were there for 2.5 hours for lunch, seriously?!    I think it was the manager who was at the front when we walked in and we were frankly not paid attention to for about 5 minutes, I was stunned, but my in-laws have the patience of a saint, so I kept my mouth shut and waited.  In case you're wondering, they weren't slammed busy.  Once we sat down, our server was very friendly but almost never came around to check on us, we had to get up and find him to get the check.    3 stars because the food was yum.  But service is key and it was lacking."}
{"text":"I've been eating here for 40 years. Let that sink in. The original owners served amazing food that has sadly been going downhill since they left on the early 90's. Several ill advised decor changes later the only decent thing on the menu is the wonton soup.  I've had bad sushi here and tonight I had some really greasy fried rice. Time to move on and quit hoping they get better."}
{"text":"I should preface this review by saying, although I was born and raised in California, I do not have extensive experience with sushi, and only began eating it in earnest when I knew I would be leaving for Ohio.  In fact, I had sushi three times during my last week in California.  I came to House of Hunan on a Wednesday night with two friends.  I'm still not used to going to Asian restaurants and not seeing Asian patrons, let alone Asian staff.  My friends both ordered chicken dishes, and I had the salmon nigiri and an Alaska sushi roll.  The nigiri was surprisingly good, with large pieces of fresh fish and well-prepared rice.  However, the roll was less pleasing.  The seaweed was tough and soggy, as if the roll had been prepared ahead of time, and although it came with six pieces, the diameter was very small, only a bit larger than a quarter, although the height of each piece was nearly an inch.  With the tough seaweed, this made for a rather chewy consumption process.    The service was quite pleasant, if a little on the over-attentive side.  Decor and presentation was nice as well.  However, given the many other listings for sushi in the area, I probably won't return for that particular meal."}
{"text":"I would not recommend this place for Chinese food or sushi. They are very expensive, & the food is very spicy & salty. For people who are trying to cut back on their sodium, this is not the place to go. My husband got the Gulf of Siam that was very salty. I got a salad along with the meal & the chicken had a big bone in it & I almost broke a tooth on it. The food is also very high in fat grams & carbs. I asked for a substitute for the rice & they did not even give me a choce for a vegetable or anything else. That is not very good way for a person who can't eat rice or that much of it , if you are a diabetic or have high blood pressure. If you want to raise you blood pressure just go there & you will make sure by the time you got out of there it will be up to the sky with all the salt that they use in their food. Their sushi is okay but it is very expensive. Parking is terrible also. They do not have a private parking lot at all. The food is way too expensive for what you order."}
{"text":"Anything lower than a one.  Have eaten here for years.  Service was poor.  Sent back food 3 times.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Terrific all the way around.  Definitely one of the finest if not THE finest in the area.  Very nice ambiance, great service and the food was excellent across the board.  We had a variety of Asian dishes, as well as a boat-load of sushi and it was all top notch.  The biggest surprise was the sushi, very fresh, excellent rice (which is key) and good presentation.  Im recently back living in the area after 25 years and House of \"Human\" is back on the list of favs."}
{"text":"Went there early on a Friday night. Asked the host if I could eat at the bar and was told \"yes\". Upon ordering a glass of wine I asked for a menu and was told I could only order sushi or appetizers at the bar. First, I was annoyed that this wasn't made clear with my initial question and second, it made me try to think of another restaurant that I've been to where they don't let you order off the full menu at the bar?? I'm still thinking. I ordered the spring rolls with shrimp and the threaded shrimp appetizers. They were both disappointing. The spring rolls were soggy and one of them had a decent amount of shrimp and the other didn't have any shrimp!! I'm not sure what is being attempted with the threaded shrimp dish as it has a deep layer of \"threads\" that surround the shrimp, making it hard to eat. I ended up having to break off most of the outside layer just to be able to take a bite. After a bit of work, the shrimp was okay and I enjoyed the dipping sauces. Service at the bar was good, although I did have to endure one of the servers showing a fellow server the infected cut on one of his fingers that had become swollen. Nice! I won't be back."}
{"text":"This House of Hunan has one of the loveliest interiors of any restaurant I have ever been to, and for that I would like to keep coming back. It's cozy but spacious, classy but still casual enough to be comfortable. They have a nice assortment of options on their menu for both the adventurous and the traditionalist, and I opted for mildly adventurous with the seafood nest. (Ok, I also just couldn't pass up such a cute name for a dish...a nest?)   Sure enough, my seafood came in an actual nest made out of fried potato shreds, and the presentation itself made me grin. All the seafood was cooked just right, and the shrimp was especially good. The vegetables were rather al dente, which is not my favorite, but I've come to expect it at Chinese restaurants. My boyfriend enjoyed his chicken in peanut sauce dish as well.   Our server wasn't exactly Mr. Warm and Fuzzy, but he did his job well, and didn't interrupt, so no complaints there. Unfortunately, my beef with this place, and the reason for two missing stars, is how it leaves me feeling. I know it's a Chinese restaurant, and if I want healthy I should go elsewhere. But for the price point of House of Hunan, I would think I would be able to walk away from a meal feeling better than I have both times I have visited.   However, I have yet to try their sushi, and I believe I will give them a shot to redeem themselves with that in the near future, hopefully leaving with a happier belly."}
{"text":"I feel giving a two star is being very generous.  Yes it is the 24 ice festival but the bar area was totally a no go.  No bar tender, no menu, no service.  Not a happy customer"}
{"text":"The service was terrible.  The food was okay.  Both me and and my friends credit card numbers were stolen from the waitress.  Be sure to bring cash if you decide to dine here."}
{"text":"Sushi is one of my favorite foods and the thing that I love about this place is how fresh the sushi is! But that's about all I can say about this place is the food is really good. My waitress today was in a very fowl mood when I first arrived. I was glad her mood had improved by the end. Also the presentation of my sushi (which usually isn't a big deal to me) but today was very noticeable that the sushi was made in a rush and looked like it was just tossed on my plate. That's was annoying to me. Although the food is fresh with everything else it is not worth the price point. Very overpriced! Which is why I don't come very often. Maybe not again after today's experience."}
{"text":"House of Hunan Fairlawn, Ohio (I am assuming since there's three locations and I am from out of town) Friday December 30, 2011  Four Stars  It is really awkward being the only Asian at an Asian restaurant.  White people always ask the same questions: So I have made a T-shirt to answer them: \"1. I am Chinese. 2. I was born in California. 3. I don't speak Chinese. 4. I don't know what you should order at restaurant that I have never been to or Panda Express.  The food here is not Hunan food but more of a general Asian restaurant.  Food from Hunan is characterized by its Spicy Flavor (chili pepper, shallots, and garlic). Here they have Japanese Sushi, Cantonese Noodles, Thai Dishes, Etc.  The service was okay.  The food was pretty good.  I had their Drunken Noodles: Shrimp and traditional rice noodles mixed with fresh garlic, hot peppers, and basil leaves, stir-fried in a tamarind sauce; & Crispy Scallops: Quick fried sea scallops and sautéed broccoli, served with a spicy sweet sauce and honey roasted walnuts.  The noodles were thinner than usual, but the dish was solid.  The Scallops were a little chewy and sauce was a little sweet but the dish worked.    On a side note, the restaurant allowed my girlfriend's Ohio Family to get blitzed on beer and sake, use vulgar language, scream and laugh like hyenas, and steal a really nice coffee cup.  Thank you and Sorry."}
{"text":"Have been a long time happy customer of Hunan in Medina. In past they've been simply incredible but the new management team need some massive improvement to get them back to where they used to be.  There's a new guy that's supposedly the manager that follows the staff around looking for areas to correct their weaknesses instead of pitching in to help. I'm now waiting for my take out order placed over 40 minutes ago on way back from airport that was supposed to be ready in 15-20 minutes.    I observed the manager reprimanding the very courteous hostess at the front counter saying she should quote at least 30 minutes for take out orders making it look like it was her fault.    They have a decent crowd but sushi bar was empty.   I'm really hoping the get back to where they were on the management team since they have usually been very good on putting together small orders in 15-20 minutes regardless of how busy they were.    Edited portion - Once I arrived home and opened the sushi container, wasabi was nowhere to be found so adding to disappointment."}
{"text":"Really good Chinese/Asian food in Medina.  They have several choices of seating types.  The General Tso's Chicken here is good.  The hot mustard is awesome here, it really goes well on the egg rolls."}
{"text":"One star is generous...we have, more than once, had bad food here; but our most recent visit went beyond poor cuisine. First let me say, our server was a pleasant person, and I believe she did her best...that being said, the service was atrocious. I'm left with the impression that it's due to poor training, rather than lack of personal effort on her part, but I could be wrong. It took Forever to even be greeted once seated and all items ordered took forever to come out of the kitchen; even soups, which were salty and lukewarm, took until just before our entrees finally came, how does that make sense? And this seemed to just be run of the mill, no apologies for the crazy long wait for food, or for the fact that temps were way off. At the end of our meal, we let the manager know we were disappointed in the experience, and he seemed, not only nonplussed, but annoyed to have been disturbed from running his mouth with members of his staff. We were a large party, and we never tip less than 20%, so one would think there would be an effort made to simply retain the customers...but not so much. Won't be back and will continue to tell people what a disappointing experience this place offers..."}
{"text":"First time here for dinner. Service was slow at first. Took them about 7-8 minutes to have a server come over to our table. There was no explanation of food specials or drink specials.   Ordered the Crab Rangoon  and edamame for an appetizer. Crab Rangoon had more cheese and very little crab. The edamame came out partially cold.   For dinner my wife got the Pad Tai and I had the Mongolian Beef. Her Pad Tai was very heavy on the fish sauce. The beef was supposed to be spicy, but I didn't taste any spices. It was also very heavy on the green onion tops.   All in all, the food was acceptable although my wife couldn't finish her meal due to the fish sauce taste.   The restaurant was kept up fairly well, however there were noticeable issues. A mixture of lights, upholstery missing buttons and areas needing paint.   If you are looking for authentic food, skip this one. It ranks up there with airport or shopping mall Asian restaurants in food quality. It was inexpensive though. At $37.00 for two dinners and two appetizers (we drank water) it wasn't bad."}
{"text":"With Chinese food everybody has there favorite spot. I judge a spot the most popular dishes. Like, egg rolls, fried rice and orange chicken. When I tell this place is amazing, boy, it's finger licking GOOD!"}
{"text":"Horrible experience at the fairlawn house of Hunan. I've eaten here several times dine in but have never gotten food to go. I ordered the seafood nest with no vegetables and extra sauce. My sister picked it up for me, and when she returned with the food there's no nest. That's literally half of the dish missing. I called house of Hunan to figure out why it was missing. The guy who answered sounded clueless and went back and forth with his manager about it, while I could hear every word. Both acted as if I was an annoyance. Finally the guy tells me you have to request the nest and it's $1 extra. When I've eaten in, it's never had to be requested and it doesn't cost anything extra. I relayed this to him only to be told it's different with carry out. Yet the website says $18.95, specifically says \"w/ nest\" so I had no reason to think it cost extra or wouldn't come with the seafood. So now my sister is on her way back, wasting her time and gas, to get something that should have came with the meal. Oh, and I can't forget that I already payed the full listed price $18.95 so I don't see why I have to spend an extra $1. I suggest you fix your website and update that the nests have to be requested if you're getting food to go, and list the extra $1 customers are required to pay. I manage a business and know false advertising when I see it, and this is a grade A example. You've lost a customer not only because of your error but also because you had no attempt to make it right."}
{"text":"What happened here?  I used to eat at this location two or three times a week a few years ago.  Lunch, dinner, drinks - it was excellent!  I stopped here at lunch on a Wednesday in October 2017 on my way home from Columbus.  The thought of Asian cuisine urged me on as I circled Medina square (lol!) twice in order to find a parking space.  I was greeted nicely by a familiar long-term hostess.  I was seated promptly and had a bit of a wait before Cristie came to take my order.  I was very aware that the restaurant closes between 3 PM and 5 PM.  I was there before 1:00.  I ordered a drink and requested a dinner menu (I wanted to order take-out for hubby).    As an app I ordered shrimp chips - these are fresh, warm, crispy, salty pork rind-like morsels that melt in your mouth!  They were everything I remembered them to be!  I also ordered edamame.  I was presented with mushy grey-green oversalted cold seed pods (with brown spots).  I left most of them on my plate.  How can you screw these up?  Microwaved fresh soy beans would have been better.  For lunch I ordered the Seafood Nest; this is normally a spectacular presentation of lobster meat, scallops, crab, shrimp and veggies in a thick clear sauce, nestled in a hot, sizzling, deep fried, shredded potato basket.  My lunch today included a half-tail lobster in its shell.  The meat was grey in color and when I grasped it to remove it from the shell it was slimy.  I smelled it and it was fishy... I put it aside on my extra plate.  There was NO WAY I was eating this!  The potato basket was cold, chewy and stale.  The seafood mixture was not fresh.  The (fake) crab meat was unnaturally shredded like tassels and laid over the lobster tail.    I ordered a General Tsao's Chicken dinner for my husband as take out.  The jury is still out on his dinner.  Cristie didn't ask how my lunch was and was non-plussed by the un-eaten grey lobster tail on my plate.  She must have been in a hurry to vamoose - I heard her giving the \"bum's rush\" to a table of four men as I left the restaurant at 2:30.  Bill: $66.00; tip: 15%.  I will not return."}
{"text":"I try and come here every week.  They have a great happy hour including half price sushi.  The have the best egg rolls ever.  I know it sounds silly but they are amazing!! I always take a few home also. After eating here I can not eat Chinese or sushi anywhere else.  You can tell the food is always fresh and high quality! The Singapore noodles and spicy crab rolls are my favorite! Honestly though, I have not tried something here that I didn't like.  This is one of my favorite restaurants in Akron, if not number one! It's worth every penny every time I come here! If you have not had the chance to dine here, you don't know what you are missing out on!!!"}
{"text":"I went Chinese and sampled the sushi.   Authentic Chinese, my mouth is watering as I type and I wish I was there for some pot stickers!"}
{"text":"This was an excelent meal.  The food was one of the best Chinese meals I have eaten. Hot and sour soup was the perfect combination of heat and flavor, I was sad when I reached the bottom.  All the food is made fresh here; egg roles, dumplings and you can task it.  The staff is friendly and prompt it was just great."}
{"text":"The last 10+ orders of our favorite dish, Prosperity Shrimp, have finally come as described on the menu. Thank you!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years. It had been about 2 years since my last visit since I moved away and was pleasantly surprised by the new remodel. It looks absolutely gorgeous! Unfortunately, it seems the food and service has gone down hill. My sweet potato maki was made with sweet potato fries. Yes, french fries. What the heck? It was awful. Soup and entree were both lukewarm and our waiter could not wait for us to leave. We came in 40 minutes before close, but were out before they closed at 10. I probably won't be back again on my next trip home."}
{"text":"An open letter to the good men and women hosting and hostessing House of Hunan:  Smile though your heart is aching Smile even though it's breaking. When there are clouds in the sky you'll get by.  If you smile through your pain and sorrow Smile and maybe tomorrow You'll see the sun come shining through For you.  Light up your face with gladness, Hide every trace of sadness. Although a tear may be ever so near That's the time you must keep on trying Smile, what's the use of crying. You'll find that life is still worthwhile- If you just smile."}
{"text":"You can tell someone really cares about this restaurant, the food that is served, and the manner in which it Is served. This is the best Asian inspired eatery in Akron. The sushi, Thai specialities and classic Chinese restaurant style dishes are all equally good. I would not hesitate to recommend House Of Hunan."}
{"text":"Sushi Home Away From Home.  I live on the West Coast where good sushi joints are plentiful and part of the regular fare. However, I am from the Midwest, where it is harder to find good, reputable sushi. Sushi is one of my favorite foods, and when I come home (which is often) it is nice to have a a good sushi place to go to.  I have eaten from the regular Hunan menu many times, and it is fantastic in its own right, but the sushi is what I really come here for. My daughter is 11 and loves to sit at the sushi bar. This restaurant is now one of our regular dinner/lunch spots.  There are a couple things you should know before you begin. As this is not a sushi restaurant by definition, they offer traditional seating and a a traditional Chinese and Japanese menu by default. If you sit in the regular dining room, you will not receive exactly the same service as you would sitting at the sushi bar. This is not a fault in the restaurant. For the layman, it is a difference in tradition:  If you sit in the regular area, the service has no way of knowing in advance what you will be ordering, and so they only treat you like a sushi customer in the sushi area. However, you do not have to order sushi when you sit at the sushi bar. The sushi bar area is full service and offers the regular bar and food menu as well.  The sushi menu is actually in two places on the menu, and it took us a few trips before the server pointed this out to us. They offer the traditional rolls inside the regular menu. However, as good sushi foodies do, I'm sure you'll want to see what creativity the chef has to offer. You will find the specialty rolls on the back page of the menu, apart from the other offerings, under the Futomaki heading, and be sure to check the Specials board as there are always one or two special creations that are not on the menu. That is where the fun is. There are many, and I have yet to try them all, but the specialty rolls here are delicious. They are 8-10 rather large pieces each instead of the usual smaller 6 of the standard rolls. There are many specialty rolls to choose from, and they are all presented with flair. Your roll will come out looking like a piece of art, right down to the cucumber display. Nothing on the plate is just \"put there\".   Regardless of which rolls you order, you will find that Hunan sushi is high-quality, fresh, hand-rolled, and does not smell like fish. Their presentation is as artistic as the ingredients themselves, and if you have a large party, your sushi will be delivered on a large wooden sushi boat. The prices on the standard rolls are well below $10, but you will pay closer to $20 for a Futomaki roll; however the Futomaki rolls are well worth the price in both portion and taste.  As picky as children are about their food, especially \"fancy food\" or food that requires a more mature palate, my 11 year old always manages to find something new that she likes when she dines here. I think it speaks highly of the restaurant when they can not only get a kid to eat such food, but to continue trying new things every time we go. The staff is friendly to her and treat her as well as any adult customer. She likes to talk to the sushi chefs while they're preparing food, and they are very friendly and talk back to her, even on busy weekend nights. They do not, however, offer a children's menu or child sized portions on either the sushi or the regular menu, so order accordingly...Sushi may be fish, rice, and veggies, but it is surprisingly filling, especially for younger diners. However, since it does not take long to pepare and doesn't get cold, you can order one roll and then order another later if you're still hungry."}
{"text":"Chef Paul was the greatest. A friend of mine and I would go in, sit down, and say, \"Wow us.\" ....and he always did. Always something new and exciting to  try when he was the sushi chef. I don't know if he's there anymore (my free time went from very little to none at all, sadly), but the man was phenomenal.   The rest of the restaurant is rather good for asian food in Akron. I don't like their pad thai (but I'm very particular about pad thai), however, their seafood is always a hit, and the service is always very good."}
{"text":"Went there for Mother's Day!  Loved the sushi, and my husband's Salmon was excellent!!  The fillet was huge, on top of veggies covered with a wonderful sauce!  I have never had a bad meal here! Can't wait to go again!!"}
{"text":"After another enjoyable meal tonight I have to upgrade House of Hunan to 5 stars.  I had the Hunan Pork, wife had the Yu-Shan chicken (try it if you like garlic).  The portions will fill you completely plus you leave with enough for another full meal.  Consistently high quality, quantity, and service."}
{"text":"This used to be such a great place to go on Sunday afternoon when you could get the lunch special prices.  Now they charge you full dinner prices all day, but you still don't get a table cloth or oil lamp during lunch hours.  Half the food for three times the price.  Wife got the Cashew Chicken, daughter had the Happy Family, they said that they were OK.  I tried the Gulf of Siam - the breading on the seafood was much too thick and soggy from the sauce.  Our female oriental server really spoiled the experience.  Long wait to take our order, the food came out quickly enough, then she starts snatching our plates away before we were done eating with her fingers in our rice bowls.  The restaurant was only about 1/4 full.  Never asked if we wanted beverages, appetizers, tea, or dessert.  Never refilled the small water glasses."}
{"text":"Holy seaweed salad! I have never had a better General Tsu's chicken in my life. This is one of best Chinese places I have been to. The restaurant is really cool too. The decor is very modern and the atmosphere within the restaurant is really electric. We have been here a couple times just for post-meetings and what not. I would love to stay one night for drinks but haven't got around to that yet. I have never been here and had a bad experience and I will definitely recommend to others!   if you like Chinese, give Hunan a try!"}
{"text":"I took an out-of-town friend here for a nice evening out and we were not disappointed. I recommended the Orange Chicken because it's a personal favorite and she loved it! I tried something new, the Peking Duck. It was very enjoyable. This is a great place for guests."}
{"text":"The ambiance was really the best part. Nice decor and good service. The food was rather disappointing. It definitely wasn't bad, but for the price I expected much more. Still one of the better restaurants in the area though."}
{"text":"Not a great experience.  Took well over an hour to get my food delivered. They forgot my drink. Had the Rose Beef. It was whatever. Supposed to be filet but was not or if it was it was the toughest filet ever. And it was not in small prices. It was large patties but they don't give you a knife to cut it. Just cheap plastic forks that bend. I will not order from here again."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Chinese food in the area. I have been going here since I was very little and my grandmas took me. Now I bring people here all the time for the delicious sushi and egg drop soup! The staff is always friendly and make guests feel welcome and appreciated. I'm not too crazy about the new look of the restaurant, but the food is still phenomenal. The seafood best is a must!"}
{"text":"We used to like the Medina House of Hunan very much years ago, but not any longer. It seemed to have run its course and has declined in every way. I would not recommend it any more. I ordered the same dish off of the Thai portion of the menu to compare it to my favorite Thai restaurant in Brunswick- Larb. It was so much worse than Larb's version that I couldn't finish it. My wife ordered something else and it looked like something that had washed up on the beach. It looked disgusting and had no flavor. The texture was awful. Good bye House of Hunan."}
{"text":"This place is da bomb with a gong! Everything they have is delicious. They have traditional dishes which are excellent and the more Americanized goodies too."}
{"text":"I love the Medina Square, it's so cute and quaint and House of Hunan just happens to be my favorite place to go to on the square. When I think of Asian Cuisine, I normally don't think of Medina Ohio, but dang House of Hunan on the square makes me think otherwise. My favorite thing to get is the Bangkok Galaxy & the OMG Roll &  The On The Square Roll. The only thing I wish House of Hunan would do better is dessert.... Sometimes you just really need to finish a meal off with something sweet. But in the past House of Hunan's dessert menu is unfortunately nothing impressive."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE!  My wife ordered some lo mein and a cup of soup this evening. The soup had a used, rolled up napkin in it! I've lived in Akron for a few years now and this is the most disgusting experience I have had at a restaurant since I moved here. The worst part of the experience was that their main staff member, Josh, was a complete prick about the entire thing. He refused to comp the meal despite that fact that someone pretty much wiped their mouth in my wife's meal. What a joke."}
{"text":"The food is great but service not so much. Have been here during lunch and dinner hours on weekdays and weekends. Food is always on point, but staff seems to rush you through your meal (which I can understand if it is busy ) but they do it even when you and one other table are the only ones in there. Have even had them take a plate away as my mother was still eating it. Very embarrassing when that happens being was her 1st trip to Ohio and wanted to take her somewhere nice. I want to be able to eat and enjoy my food not be rushed out for the next customer. Food gets 5 stars (if not higher) but over all experience gets 2.5 to 3 stars. Due to the get them in get them out method."}
{"text":"I had the General Tso's Chicken with brown rice. It was pretty bland and mediocre, without peppers even though the dish was listed as spicy. The brown rice was dry and did not clump, making it hard to eat with chopsticks. Worse, the brown rice didn't taste very good, something I've never experienced with rice, since it is usually pretty neutral."}
{"text":"Worst place ever! The food mediocre at best the service absolutely sucks! Management can care less if you tell them your food came out prepared badly they just argue with you. Don't go there this place is horrible!"}
{"text":"Grabbed some takeout at the request of my Chinese-speaking, Chinese-food-craving daughter. The bar area is nice, and I enjoyed a cold Kirin beer while I waited. The food quality was good. Chicken fried rice was excellent. I ordered the moo shu pork for myself. The flavor was good, but the wrappers were a little stiff and, most disappointingly, they didn't include any hoisin sauce! How can you miss that! Still, pretty good overall."}
{"text":"Food was really great!   General Tso chicken had just the right amount of spice.   Service was abysmal. Sitting for 20 min and still had not placed an order.  Had to flag down hostess to get a food order placed."}
{"text":"Today I picked up an order to go.  Hunan shrimp, extra spicy, to go. I understand there wasn't a lot of shrimp (6) for lunch would be appropriate. Missing from original recipe:  no pea pods, water chestnuts, corn, 2 pieces of mushrooms. I know you have to cut back because of cost, but it's too much elimination. Please don't do this to one of the best dishes you serve. I am one of your 50+ yr customer."}
{"text":"Good service even on a busy night like Mother's Day, of course it helps to call ahead. The menus selection was very authentic and tasteful."}
{"text":"Its a bummer to write this, because the food here is generally good, but this week they have lost my business.   On 12/11/17 I was charged for the full amount of the bill including the tip. On 12/26/17, I was charged AGAIN, this time, just for the amount of the tip. I called the front desk. She informed me that on the weekend of my visit, the server went down that processes the credit cards, causing tips to be processed later. Her explanation didn't explain why tips were processed 2+ weeks later, nor the fact that I was correctly charged the full amount of the bill and tip after my first visit.   I am still awaiting a call back from the manager, but it has been 2 days so I don't suspect it will happen. In the meantime, the charge has been disputed with my bank.  Potential diners beware."}
{"text":"Great place to go to when you want authentic Asian food. I get the orange flavored chicken and a spring roll. The wait is not long at all and the waitress we had last time was very nice but hard to understand. The food is great but sort of expensive    I recommend this restaurant for sure!"}
{"text":"The interior is really beautiful and the lighting is dim, making this a great place for a date.  I went with a group and we sat at this floor level table, but it was comfortable.  The food and sushi were great and the prices were reasonable.  Overall a great experience and I would definitely return."}
{"text":"I was quite surprised to find great Chinese food hidden in downtown Medina, Ohio. It has become my favorite Chinese food restaurant over the last few years. Great food (a great secret is the sushi roll dish \"On the Square\", it is not on the menu), good service and a trip to Medina Square is always enjoyable for me. If you get there early enough, you can walk to the bakery next door for dessert. The prices are a little high in my opinion but you get what you pay for in this instance. It also has a fun \"appetizer\" seating area in the front of the restaurant. Don't try to sit there for dinner though, the chubby manager hasn't heard the saying that the customer is always right. We argued over it and I was willing to lose in order to still eat the sushi:)"}
{"text":"Well, I was really hoping to review this as a 3 star establishment, but I would not classify this place as \"A-OK\". Because, Eek; Methinks not!  Now let me make one thing clear, I have only been to this place twice. Once which was meh, and the other time which was absolutely horrible and cannot be forgiven on any level.  My first time here was barely memorable and so was the food, so I can't really speak on it much. Now my second time here, well, let's just call it an atrocity.   First off, we were quoted a 20 minute wait that turned into an hour almost. We had our Grandmother with us, who is unable to stand for very long and she had to basically climb up a barstool and sit uncomfortably the entire duration of our wait.  We were finally called to our table and introduced to our abominable waitress. She looked at us, as if we screamed \"no tip\" upon her greeting us. She was rude, hostile and extremely short on taking care of us. I wish I had of complained that night about her, but it's too late now.   Ok, let's get to the worse part of the night...the food. I ordered the Tiger & Phoenix, and oh, my, God. It was horrific! There was barely any Lobster at all and it was still a blue tint, indicating that it was undercooked. On top of that, it had an extremely fishy smell and taste, which means it was not fresh. The Chicken was so fatty that I had filled my napkin with wads of fat spit.  The only reason I did not throw a fit was because our Grandmother was buying and she is very old. I just wanted her to be happy, so I said nothing until later on to my Wife. She was so upset, telling me that I wish I had of told her. Apparently her food was horrible also. Go figure.  So yeah, that's about it for this place. Nuff said."}
{"text":"Awesome sushi! Delicious food. Great atmosphere and very friendly staff! Great for date nights. The best Asian cuisine and fantastic menu selection."}
{"text":"So I must say, I am insanely disappointed in House of Hunan. I always make it a point to eat there every time I am in town. Usually each experience has been pretty good. However, my mom and I ordered take out a couple of nights ago. While we were eating the \"minced chicken and lettuce\" she got a piece of metal in the chicken mixture. It was so disgusting, not to mention she is lucky she didn't break a tooth. We couldn't even bring ourselves to finish the meal we had ordered. Skip forward to today (Friday 4/05) and I decided to give them another chance to redeem themselves. (Plus I was craving sushi and I had heard decent reviews.) So I ordered a nothing special avocado roll, a California roll, and an order of edamame. So I went to pick it up and brought the receipt from the previous night (along with the piece of metal) and mentioned that this was in our chicken the other night. The hostess (white male) simple said \"oh yeah, the cooks clean the woks after every order with a stainless steel brush and that happens sometimes.\" Not so much as even an apology. I wasn't expecting anything out of this ordeal other than an apology and making sure it doesn't happen to some other poor person who may actually break their tooth... Ok so bad to the sushi that I ordered today... By far the WORST sushi I have ever eaten (and come on it's a freaking avocado and California roll, how hard is that to mess up?!?!) so for beginners, I ordered the sushi to be made with soy paper (which they charged me $2 extra for... Really?! I just moved back from Columbus where I are sushi ALL of the time and they never charged for this and I always had amazing sushi which was also not as pricey.) then they jammed a bunch of nasty pickled ginger in the to go container so the entire row that was next to it tastes like disgusting pickled ginger. Next the rice was so incredibly awful... It was so sweet. Which could only mean it is so insanely processed (yay!!) Do dispite those two issues, I was starving so I attempted to eat a piece or two, which proceeded to completely fall apart. I'm pretty sure I can roll sushi better than they can... I was so ridiculously disappointed with the entire experience. I do not think I can bring myself to spend another dollar there again. Pretty bad customer service coupled with metal pieces and crappy food? No thanks!"}
{"text":"No more half price sushi.    I've been in mourning for the past three months, since they discontinued the popular Tuesday night offering.  Not to worry, they still have tasty happy hour specials and their food really is worth the full price.    House of Hunan caters to larger groups (if you call ahead), and if you come with someone celebrating a birthday, they will bring a scoop of ice cream with a sparkler out after the meal.  Now that it's summertime, I suspect they will start opening their front windows during the day.  Those are the seats you want, and sushi really is a nice meal on a warm day.  Be sure to ask about their specialty rolls.. the ones not listed on the menu.  Service with a smile, and still walking distance from our home."}
{"text":"I ordered the shrimp tempura bento and it was delicious. I did get some unexpected tempura veggies like a slice of green bell pepper, egg plant and a red chili pepper. The tempura dipping sauce was perfect! The miso soup was also really good and had both tofu and seaweed.  I have it 4 starts because for dessert I had the mojo and it was terrible. The mochi's outside case was thick, hard and lacked flavor. The ice cream inside was okay."}
{"text":"I was out shopping with my girlfriend one day in Akron and happened upon a Chinese restaurant reminiscent of old Chinatown.  Instantly I was intrigued by hoping for a great restaurant, but fearful of judging a book by its cover.  Upon entry, the seating area was huge.  Staff was friendly and directed us to our table.  I cannot explain what it was but I had a good feeling about this place.  The menu is quite large with Thai and Japanese options as well.  I went with a sought after rare to be done well favorite dish of mine...Sweet and Sour chicken.  I also ordered 2 spring rolls.  My lovely ordered red curry dish and hot and sour soup.  We made small talk about our great finds in the shopping center and wondered what the delivered package would taste like once served. The spring rolls I had were fantastic, lightly oiled vegetable only, great fine crisp crunch both in roll and veggies each bite.  I am told the Sweet and Sour soup was great, among the best.  My Sweet and Sour Chicken was near perfect as to what I look for...Light sauce, not too heavy, fresh pineapple, green pepper, and onion.  The batter of the chick was light, fluffy yet satisfying.  Crisp, not over cooked, not too much oil.  Tasted perfect with the sauce If I have one complaint its that dessert was not what I had expected.  The menu had said fried bananas and I am still forever searching for a restaurant that will flambé right at the table.  I had asked the server if that was done and she said yes.  This was not the case, but what was brought out was quite the treat.  Individually fried banana slices with decadent vanilla ice cream and almond cookies.  Being that everything was served satisfactorily, I will choke the mix-up to miscommunication, but the food is great, and we will definitely make a trip out of our back here.  Perfection"}
{"text":"I asked the Chinese waiter what the most authentic Chinese dish was. He suggested the three cup tofu. I ordered it but was not impressed. I moved to Akron recently and was craving some real Chinese food but this wasn't it at all. It was incredibly salty and just fried tofu... Not authentic at all. It looks like their prices are also high for their quality... Probably because so much money goes to pay for overhead like their ornate entrance and all the decorations. I much prefer Chin's place down the hall. It tastes more like food my parents would make."}
{"text":"The dumplings in chili sauce are divine. Service was fast and friendly. I love how the cozy atmosphere."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this restaurant!! The food is always fresh and cooked perfectly! I always order the vegetable steamed dumplings and for my main meal I order the seafood nest with no potato basket! I love it!"}
{"text":"After having a horrendous experience at Pad Thai Fairlawn less than a mile away, and storming out of there, I enjoyed a wonderful meal with my wife and two young daughters at House of Hunan. Food and service were excellent. I have been there multiple times in the past and will go back for sure."}
{"text":"Huge portions amazing quality. General Tso's is best around.   Normally you get rice under your chicken.. Here you get chicken under your rice."}
{"text":"Food and service has taken a steep dive.  Sushi is no longer any good and food is barely above that in a mall food court.  This used to be the best around, but no more.  Very sad indeed."}
{"text":"The inside is really nice and I didn't expect to see such a spacious, well-decorated interior, based on the sign outside and the large double doors at the entrance. Like other reviewers mentioned, the menu is expansive and includes an array of Asian cuisine, not just Chinese food. The food we ordered was not bad - we had the sweet and sour chicken, spicy orange beef, and some noodles. The quality was not bad, but the food was typical in the sense that it is greasy and heavy. I"}
{"text":"We have been eating at House of Hunan for as long as we've lived in Akron (24 years) and have always been huge fans...until recently. We went there for Mother's Day and had an awful experience. After making reservations a month in advance, we still had to wait a half hour for our table. This wouldn't have bothered me so much if they'd had a highchair for our then 11-month-old. We were told that all of their high chairs were being used and that as soon as one became available, they would bring it to us. When I made the reservation, I told the person on the phone that we would need TWO highchairs (one for my niece). Unfortunately, we never got that second one...nor did we get any kind of apology from management. That pretty much ruined our lunch as trying to eat with an 11-month-old and a two-year-old who aren't strapped in to highchairs is virtually impossible. It was Mother's Day for crying out loud! People generally go out to eat with the children. How could any dining establishment not have enough highchairs?? We spent close to $200 on lunch that day (there were 7 in our party) and not even one apology for not being prepared, even though we had reservations.  Their food has taken quite a downturn in the past year. Definitely not what it used to be. Such a shame. Their Crab Meat with Cheese wontons are still good...and that's about it. You're better off going down the street to PF Changs...you'll get better service and better food."}
{"text":"Beautiful decor, disappointing food. Both my Hot Sour Soup and Sechuan chicken had an overly vinegar undertone. Nice Spring Roll, but that's about it."}
{"text":"Been here several times now ...favorites are the House Fried Rice, Drunken Noodles, Hunan Chicken!"}
{"text":"The staff here are super friendly and very knowledgeable. I am gluten free and they went back and checked the ingredients for us. They can pretty much make anything gf and it tastes awesome!! The Hunan veggies with fried tofu is a great meal. Lunch specials are a very nice price. Even the ginger dressing for the salad is gf and that doesn't happen at any place. I will definitely be going back. They are going to be getting a gf cheesecake in the near future"}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal at House of Hunan and I've been eating there for many many years. I am certain, though, that if anything I ordered didn't live up to expectations, the staff at the restaurant would correct it in a heartbeat.  The atmosphere here is very pleasant. You can tell they took a lot of care in placing their decor and arrangements. The staff appears to have been trained well, pleasant with smiles and attentiveness.  The food is excellent, and never takes too long to be delivered after the order. A few favorite items of mine are : spicy tuna roll, spicy crab salad, drunken noodles, ho fun (stir fried noodles), noodle soup, twice cooked pork, and mandarin hot pork. Their noodle dishes are quite authentic which is why I like them so much.  Update : I have a pet peeve about restaurants charging eat-in customers extra for steamed rice with their entrees. I am very disappointed that this establishment which I have been a patron of for over 10 years, is now charging me $2 for a bowl of white rice after the first one. Because of this, I will now avoid eating here when I am in the mood for entrees that are served with rice."}
{"text":"I travel for a living all over the World.  House of Hunan, located in my hometown, has proven to be my favorite of all for almost a decade.  I'd highly recommend the green or red curries."}
{"text":"Super slow and inattentive service.  Burned spring rolls, very forgettable meal.  The wood floor needed refinishing years ago.  No on sight management the most depressing music on earth . Seems like who ever owns this sad establishment is just milking it for cash."}
{"text":"House of Hunan is one of the nicest places to eat in Medina.  Not only do they have a great variety of Asian food they also have a great location.  I love when they open up the windows when it is nice outside and you can look out at the square.    One of my favorite things to get at Hunan is the sushi.  It is a great quality and not too expensive.  It was even better when they had half priced sushi on Thursdays.  I'm sad they discontinued this.    Hunan is the only place in Medina you can get Thai, and I love Pad Thai.  Basically you can't go wrong with Hunan.  Make sure to check it out if you're driving through Medina."}
{"text":"In my mind, there are tiers of Asian restaurants:  Tier I - Cheap. Greasy. Typical menu. Hits you like a rock. Low quality meats. This place sells a lot of Sweet and Sour Chicken. Primarily take out.  Tier II - Middle of the road. More defined menu. You have your go-to dishes that are consistent. Nicer dining area. No plastic silverware.  Tier III - Nothing bad on the menu - never a regret in selection. Upscale dining room. High quality meats and seafoods. Signature dishes.  For dinner, House of Hunan is a solid III. My favorite dish is Three Cups Chicken, but I have yet to be disappointed. The quality is high an you pay for it, but you leave satisfied.  For lunch, however....order off of the dinner menu, Solid II for mid-day (at least week-day) dining. Same great atmosphere, clearly serving lower quality food. Still better than a I on it's best day, but I'm just saying...  Good Thai and sushi as well!"}
{"text":"I recently moved back to Akron after six years. I used to eat at House of Hunan frequently and always thought of it as a superior Chinese restaurant.  I was in there last week and was greatly disappointed. I had chicken fried rice. A simple dish that should be a no brainier for even the novice chef. This stuff was awful! It was oily and under cooked and the \"chicken\" in it looked like the stuff in a chicken mcnugget. What happened to the House of Hunan I knew and loved?"}
{"text":"Very poor food. It just had no flavor. The chicken had way too much breading. The service was very poor."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere.  The dining area was very busy for a Monday night, almost full but the service was top notch and never rushed.  The Tom Yum soup had a delicious broth and a large scallop, shrimp, mussel and shiitake mushroom, a couple halved grape tomatoes and a couple pea pods.   For an entree I ordered the Hunan chicken and it was 5 stars.  The chicken was moist and tender.  The sauce had a nice spice to it  and the veggies were cooked just to the edge of tender, perfect. Entree portion was large.    I'll come again next time through this area.  The prices are on the high side ($3-6 for soup, most entrees $12-16 range) but for good quality food I'll pay."}
{"text":"So disappointed. I stopped here with my mom while walking around the square. We came in from out of town to visit, but used used to hear so many great things about HoH when I lived in the area. Unfortunately those things were either a fluke or things have gone downhill.   The decor is great. Very contemporary and the space is small but doesn't feel cramped.   We each ordered a drink, both of which were tasty. I'd give compliments to the bartender or whomever was making drinks that day at lunchtime. The Medina Mule was definitely a repeat if I could bring myself to order more food there.   Now we ordered a few rolls and sashimi. The rolls' names don't matter because the key here is none of the fish tasted fresh. I think the tuna sashimi was the only one that was decent. The rest of the food tasted just old. Also our server would have been notified but she didn't seem interested. We barely saw her and when we did she was gone as quickly as she arrived.   Overall, I'd never recommend sushi here. Didn't have any of the entrees, but if the sushi is an indication of the pride in their work, I'd rather not. I probably won't return."}
{"text":"Came back for an encore on Mother's Day with a party of six.  Same experience, different day!  Pot stickers, egg rolls, Tsing Taos, and wine by the glass to begin.  Had an assortment of main courses to share:  Mongolian Beef, a filet dish, a sauted chicken dish and multiple sushi orders.  We all mixed and matched.  The six of us left happy and contented!  Not a cheap meal, but well worth the cuisine, atmosphere, and service.  Will be back once again..."}
{"text":"I've been to House of Hunan countless times, and while the food (I mainly go there for the sushi) is typically good, the service is ALWAYS horrible. I've worked in the restaurant industry for 10 years...I know what good customer service is supposed to be. The employees at House of Hunan, however, do not.  The most recent time I went to House of Hunan, I called ahead to see if I could place a reservation.  The man on the phone was unbelievable.  He was rude and unhelpful and somewhat offensive in his tone.  When my friends and I arrived at the restaurant, we were NOT greeted, although there was a middle-aged man (I assumed it was the same man I spoke with on the phone) AND a twenty-something year old girl standing at the hostess desk....doing nothing. They stood there and ignored us until I approached them telling them I had a reservation. After a few moments of them fumbling around and telling me to \"hold on,\" I was informed that they had no record of my reservation. They were not accommodating, they offered no explanation as to why my reservation didn't exist, and told us they had no room for us for \"at least an hour, probably longer.\"  Needless to say, we left still hungry, and I vowed to never return."}
{"text":"This is one of the only restaurants in this area that is consistently amazing.    No matter what you get, you will not be disappointed.  I always get the General Tso's Chicken, which has an excellent flavor and spice to it.  And of course, you have to get some egg rolls as an appetizer.  They are THE BEST I have ever had.  Service is great, fast, and a little comical as well.  It's a little on the expensive side, but it is well worth it in my opinion. It's always a favorite place to go!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was doing a quiet business on a recent Monday night. Located on Medina Square, it is contemporary and appealing. It featured special pricing on wine, beer, and some appetizers and sushi rolls. I believe the special pricing continued until 7:00PM.  I had a good Chardonnay and the pour was generous. I could only drink part of it. My friend started with beer. We shared a small version of gyoza, a little  over-fried, but still good.  We both ordered the Alaska rolls and thought they were very good. I also ordered the shrimp tempura roll and it too was good.  No complaints on the sushi rolls. Couldn't quite finish those either.  The bill came without the advertised discounted wine price. After I pointed it out to our server, she rectified it. I recommend this as a desirable restaurant in Medina."}
{"text":"Really enjoy this restaurant but I would avoid it for take out.    Second time I'm a short while I have ordered take out and got home to find out the meal was missing the rice which is a major part of an Asian meal.  Called and all they could offer was a 2 credit.   Sorry but not good enough customer service in my mind."}
{"text":"My family comes here for special occasions and holidays so we don't have to worry about cooking. While the food has always been just fine, and the service great, we've noticed the prices seem to be going up.  Today we ordered Pad Thai, sushi. General Tso Chicken, Beef Lo Mein. While General Tso Chicken was fine, the pad Thai was incredibly underwhelming. I'd never call something gross, but his fish was vertically near that. I'm very familiar with Pad Thai and back where I'm from I'm familiar with the flavors. This Pad Thai is something I've never tasted before. It tasted very sweet and had a peculiar flavor to it. It wasn't eh fish sauce but something else. Definitely not worth the price we paid.  The sushi was fine, although one of the tools had seaweed a little more chewy than expected.   Overall this experience today was very underwhelming."}
{"text":"Met a friend here, and it was so good I wanted it again later that night, and the next day when I saw a location in Medina.  Mmm.  We came near their mid-afternoon closing, but they were very flexible.  We got our order in so the kitchen could relax, and service was good, not rushed.  The decor is sort of modern old-school, classy, open, and relaxing.  And the food?  Phenomenal.  Checking in on Yelp gets you a free egg roll, and it was pretty darn good.  Smallish, but packed full of good meat and cabbage.  We shared a California roll, which was nicely made, with perfect rice and good \"crab\" and veggies.  Also had one of the specials, chili pork wontons.  Obviously made with love, and then doused with hot chili oil.  Tender, tasty, a little spicy (the kind that builds to a nice burn.)    My friend had General Tso's and said it was very good.  I had the 3 Cups chicken, and- wow.  I think the cups are garlic, basil, and chicken?  Anyway, brought out in a super hot pot.  Be very careful.  Sizzling, tender chunks of chicken, bursting with flavor from the garlic and basil.  Nice portion.  I chose fried rice with it, and it was a very good version.    Very interesting menu, and I want to explore the rest of it.  But what we had was great.  Every single thing was tasty, and we had leftovers.  Less than $40 for all that food, very very good food, and a good experience."}
{"text":"Nice little place, great dishes, generous proportions. I get general tsos , mild, combo, and vegifried rice, and egg foo young, usually and never dissatisfied. prices are good and quality, and service great."}
{"text":"I've enjoyed dining at House of Hunan several times in the past, but tonight I decided to order carry out for two, and it was a big disappointment. Upon arriving home and emptying the bags, we discovered we were missing the Fried Rice for the Teriyaki Chicken \"soup\". No, they don't actually have Teriyaki Chicken soup on the menu, but the chicken and veggies were swimming in so much liquid, it spilled over the edges of the container when the lid was removed.  It was almost as disappointing as the missing Fried Rice. But still not as disappointing as the bland Eggrolls, and the crabless, cold Crabmeat with Cheese (Rangoons). The Pad Thai wasn't terrible, but not as good as it's been in the past, while dining in the restaurant. The only reason this review gets two stars, is because the Spicy Crab Salad was delicious . . . but still not worth the $50."}
{"text":"The sushi is average but most of the Chinese dishes are excellent.  The wonton soup is so good that I sometimes eat it as a meal. The waiting staff have never been anything less than awesome. The lunch prices are great."}
{"text":"This is truly a unique restaurant in my opinion. I love the quaint sub-city feel of Medina square and House of Hunan really plays on that vibe. There is a modern feel with a hint of an offbeat layout. The front windows open up on warm days to the busy sidewalks from a drink lounge with leather chairs and cocktail tables. Past the lounge area, there are some booths and regular tables next to a indoor water fountain in the middle of the restaurant. Next, you can sit at the sushi bar accompanied by a very large fish tank with many exotic fish to look at. Finally, there is an area where you can actually enjoy your meal in a floor pit that gives the illusion you are sitting where everyone else is walking. Basically you're sitting in the floor. Very cool.  The food is just as imaginative and fun to look at. Sushi comes beautifully prepared on the plate with other forms of seafood on top of it. Shrimp, caviar, all sorts of stuff! The General Tso's Chicken isn't the best I've had around the Cleveland area, but I would definitely recommend the sushi here. I would love to review some other dishes, but I'm afraid I'm a creature of habit when it comes to Asian foods. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Great service (unless it's right before closing), great food every time.   Creative drinks that don't disappoint!  They have doors that open to the picturesque square."}
{"text":"Like dirty martinis? Get a vodka (or gin) with the wasabi cream cheese olives... Or just ask for some olives and skip the alcohol (although I wouldn't recommend it) Also try a mango mojito (it's not on the menu but the owner makes a wicked one!)"}
{"text":"I have tried their lo mein, Hunan Chicken and Kung pao chicken and they are yummmm. Their soups are good too. Hands down the best Chinese food near my house"}
{"text":"Fast, hot and delicious. A little pricier than other thai food, but worth it with the quality ingredients."}
{"text":"Im not sure what's with all of he not-so-hot reviews. The places is beautiful, feels like a swanky restaurant. My fiancé and I dined her this evening and our food was delicious and came out in no time. The restaurant is very clean. It offers everything from sushi to Thai to your neighborhood chicken and broccoli. They offer a beautiful wine flight with your choice of 4 wines for 6 bucks. I loved it."}
{"text":"Always Delish!!!!!   Ask for the Happy New Year ....... It's not on the menu !!!!!   It's my little secret and I'm sharing it with all of you!"}
{"text":"I've gone to this place for 25 years or so. It's changed a lot over the years but there are dishes that have not changed. I don't like the addition of sushi because it's not very good at all and they put way too many sauces on it. The wait staff has not changed:very attentive. I believe I will probably always go here because I've been going since I was 5 or 6.   The one on Exchange is awful and completely disappointing."}
{"text":"It had been over 10 years since I had been here so I wasn't to for sure what to expect. Their food is very fresh and large servings. They are also very helpful on allergy issues. Their menu indicates all GF foods and they were very accommodating on checking other ingredients for us. We have been there 3 times in the last month and it has been very consistent.  Will definitely  be back."}
{"text":"We ordered take out.  The edamame appetizer was delicious.  The Tom Yum soup broth was delicious.  The menu stated it was to be loaded with seafood and tofu.  It one piece of 5 different items for a total of 5 bites and broth.  I was disappointed.  This is not a description of loaded.  Sushi was delicious as always.  For the price, we expect it to be a step above other restaurants.  For take out, it was not.  For eating in, maybe, as you get the atmosphere."}
{"text":"We got take-out on this occasion. I got shrimp with broccoli, and my wife got beef with broccoli, (George Sr. be damned.) I requested mine spicy with brown rice, a nice option), and my wife got standard seasoning and white rice. These folks have always been a notch above the standard Chinese restaurant, and they remain so.  I think there might have been a gram or two of protein that happily found it's way into my egg-roll, and both main dishes were fine. Part of the reason these folks are a cut above the standard competing Chinese restaurant is that they are a bit pricier.  Not quite a PF Chang's, but a cut above the standard rates one finds elsewhere."}
{"text":"Always awesome food and atmosphere.  I've been here many times and never had a bad meal.  The menus offers a wide variety, and suitable for a pallets.    Service on the other hand is another story.  The hostesses are not friendly, and seem like you are bothering them for coming in.  Waitresses are not attentive and leave your cups empty, and plates at your table.  We have had a few occasions when they've been just rude; again, almost like you're interrupting them for coming in.   All that into account, the food is worth some tolerance as long as you bring good company...or order take out."}
{"text":"I was super excited to visit my family and check out downtown Medina with my son last Sunday. We decided to have lunch at House of Hunan at 1pm and had a group of 5 including a 3 year old. The restaurant had a very tranquil and relaxing vibe with the windows opened in the front so everyone walking could see inside from the street. The seating was interesting as there were 4 large tables surrounded with big leather chairs, regular chairs and tables and long wooden benches that are accompanied by pillows down the middle. The middle also has a metallic waterfall down half of the restaurant that my son seemed to enjoy. Nice and relaxing.   We were greeted by our server and we decided to have a shared meal that included appetizers, sushi and the lunch specialties. I started with the wonton soup that was just ok. To be honest, the broth was pretty salty and the wonton didn't have much flavor. The egg roll I had next was filled with lots and lots of cabbage but it was pleasant appetizer that I would order again, especially with the duck sauce that accompanied it. We all shared the crab and tuna sushi's which were very fresh. We also shared the volcano roll which was a California roll topped with spicy crawfish, which had a little heat and definitely a roll that will fill you up. The best ways to describe the Teriyaki Chicken dish was that it was bland and didn't have much seasoning. Our General Tso's dish was the complete opposite with fresh flavor and the heat I was looking for. I was not impressed with the fried rice, it tasted like just plain old cooked brown rice.   Overall, we had a pleasant experience at House of Hunan. Our server was friendly, accommodating and the atmosphere of the restaurant was fantastic. I would come back but I would probably just stick with a meal of sushi and skip the specialty dishes."}
{"text":"I have had really great experiences at House of Hunan recently. I have both catered and eaten at this location and all times the service has been great/the staff accommodating. The restaurant doesn't open until 11:30, but they have had my large catering orders ready at 11:30 or earlier. The staff also did a good job on checking to see if I needed anything, helped me out to my car without asking, and even called and checked in later in the day to see how everything went.  Hunan gives great portion sizes and plenty of plain or fried rice with your order. I have ordered a number of dishes (noodles, chicken, vegetables) and all were good. I have had the sushi here once and didn't have any issues with it.  I will say I wish they were open earlier for just catering orders as it is impossible to get  back to the office and eat before noon if you pickup at 1130. Chinese is great for catering, less expensive and more then enough food, and would probably use Hunan more if I was able to guarantee pickup by 11AM or delivery by 1130AM."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and got the chef's choice sushi with California Roll. My table also had the spicy tuna and Alaska Roll. The spicy tuna is not the tuna steak with sauce as I prefer but more the purée. While the Sweat and Sour soup was very flavorful, the sushi we each had was very bland. Glad we went as the decor and atmosphere is contemporary and a nice dinning experience. The sushi however I would simply pass and go to Project Sushi."}
{"text":"Waited thirty minutes for a cold dish that tasted like dog food. Going to Tokyo next time."}
{"text":"Hmmm...  My sister and I were in Medina visiting our cousins and we all had cravings for sushi and pad thai so they suggested House of Hunan.  I was surprised by how quaint yet modern with a more upscale feel the restaurant is.  The ambiance, however, doesn't really make up for the service.  Evidently you need to call way ahead of time to make a reservation otherwise they look at you like you are out of your mind that you might want to eat there.  After waiting over thirty minutes for a table, we were finally seated at one of the large booths near the water fountainy thing in the middle of the restaurant.  We ended up needing to bring one of my cousin's kiddos with us due to dad having a late running golf outing... I do not recommend this as House of Hunan is not kid friendly in the least.  The manager actually came over once to let us know that \"the water has an awful lot of chemicals in it\" when he noticed the kids sitting next to the fountain and one of them had stuck a finger in the stream of water (aka \"Tell your kid to get his fingers out of the stupid water fountain.\").  There is no children's menu and they do not serve child size portions.  Service started out decent but after the food was served it was hard to find the waitress for refills and such.  As far as food, everything was pretty tasty.  We had a variety of plates overflowing the table.  Several different sushi rolls (everyone really liked the Key West), edamamme (can't really jack that up), salads, tofu pad thai, lo mein, some kind of green beans, and chicken and broccoli.  Beware that they charge you for rice with the entree meals.  She asked if we wanted fried or white with the chicken and broccoli so you would think it was included but we were charged $2.50 for it.  I guess that they have some kind of signature dessert that consists of a cheesecake layer with chocolate cake and chocolate mousse which sounded delicious.  However, they had already sold out of it.  Overall, a decent meal but make a reservation and leave the kids at home."}
{"text":"Everything I've ever ordered here has been absolute perfection! This is a menu you should feel confident trying new things from."}
{"text":"Definitely the best Chinese food around. You can tell they use high quality ingredients and they even give you a teabag in your takeout order"}
{"text":"Very tranquil place from the moment you walk in. I was warmly welcomed at the door and by my server, always makes for that much better of an experience. Im realizing, its the little things in life. The center aisle-seating is pleasantly set next to a running water, fake wall we'll call it. Chef is nestled kindly in the back corner, as to oversee all of the customers, as well as put on his show of creating excellent dishes.   Now for some constructive criticism, I am an avid sushi eater. I like to think of myself as a conneuiseur of the cuisine. pseudo fantasy. Anyways, I would definitely buy my seaweed wrap from another company, it was a little tough and dry-tasting, which is in no way a knock on the chefs skills. Everything else could not have been better.   Now for a little story on my experience here. I was called upon to work out here in lovely Medina due to an unrelated issue that is out of my pay-grade. No problem, here I come Medina! I stopped here for lunch, put in work at the office and home I went. It was not until then I realized I did not have my bank card, back to Medina I go. I called to make sure it was there and it was, luckily. The lovely hostess remembered my face, I will never forget hers either, gave me my card and back home I went. I could not help but sing my senior class song all the way home. Check it out...   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3MXiTeH_Pg"}
{"text":"Unfortunately I cannot contribute to the positive reviews this place has.   To start positive, the atmosphere is very nice and set up well for an intimate meal or a place to meet with a group. In addition, everyone was pleasant that we interacted with.   However, the looks and pleasantness are all a facade for a sub-par meal. I admit I am not a sushi eater so if that is what you are looking for then you should read other reviews. That being said, we did have an order of California rolls. While CA rolls is not the most flavorful dish (the avocado mutes them) these had no flavor and all you could taste was the seaweed wrap.  For our meals I had Mongolian Beef and my wife had the Happy Paradise (steak and scampi). The Mongolian beef was bad. While I am all for tender meat, this was mush. In addition, the sauce had an odd taste and tasted like it was stale (how is that possible?). Both my wife's steak and scampi were chewy (steak ordered medium).  For the prices of our meals, we expected so much more. I could have gotten better Mongolian beef at the take out place down the street and a better steak at Applebees for a third of the price."}
{"text":"I have been here about 4 times and find it very good.  The Hunan dishes are nice and spicy, the fried rice is great and just about everything I ever got was wonderful and the portions are spectacular.  The won ton soup with vegetables is enough to feed a family for $4.00.  I go out of my way to go here at least once a month.  Sure beats the fast food, Asian carry outs all over town.  The people are always nice and I recommend this place to many people.  While not a fancy sit down place, there are plenty of tables and real silverware."}
