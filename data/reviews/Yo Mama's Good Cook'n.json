{"text":"Unfortunately I was underwhelmed by Yo Mama's Good Cook'n when I made a visit to the south Phoenix restaurant two weeks ago. 

I like the atmosphere. Yo Mama's Good Cook'n is a simple, quaint eatery on the northwest corner of 24th Street and Roeser Road (next to a barber shop). The restaurant seats a max of 44 people, has booths, tables for groups and a patio (which is not open during the summer). You'll hear old school R&B/soul music on the stereo system. 

However, the food got a C from me. I tried the BBQ beef ribs, collard greens and the corn on the cob. The greens were actually decent. I splashed some malt vinegar on them and I was satisfied. The corn on the cob was OK - you should not be in a kitchen if you can't make corn on the cob! I prefer mine grilled and although this was boiled, it was still fine. 

As for the beef ribs - they were bland. The meat was tough and even though the sauce was thick, it just didn't have that ooomph! I prefer pork ribs, but you will not find any swine on the menu! This restaurant is 100% Pork-Free!!

Owner Abdul Levon says his restaurant aims to provide a healthier version of soul food. Fish, chicken, salmon and turkey are the main staples at Yo Mama's Good Cook'n.

I hear that the desserts - especially the apple cobbler - are off tha chain!! I didn't try the desserts but I've received several good referrals from friends who have eaten there. 

Overall I plan to visit Yo Mama's Good Cook'n again even though this isn't the most positive review. There are many other options on the menu so I have to believe that I'll have a better experience when I go next time. I'll try the BBQ chicken. 

I wish much success to Abdul and Chef Zee. However, I suggest that they spice up their food a little bit more so they can become a major go-to soul food spot in the Phoenix area."}

I have to say, I was eager to fall in love with this little place, mostly because it's in my own backyard (which currently, is overgrown with chain restaurants like Applebees). Thankfully, I was not disappointed with either the atmosphere or the food. 

Yo Mama's Good Cook'n is a simple eatery on the northwest corner of 24th Street and Roeser Road. The restaurant seats a max of 44 people, has booths, tables for groups and a patio. They were playing   R&B/soul music (not Motown) on the stereo system which added to the atmosphere.

My husband, Ross, and I went on a rainy afternoon -- we thought it was a perfect day for eating \"soul food.\" The place wasn't bustling, but there was enough business for us to see the ginormous beef ribs come out to one table and Chef Lynn's famous smoked turkey legs go out to another table -- both are listed under $6! 

Between the two of us, we ordered: Mama's Famous Chicken and Waffles, a side of corn bread, sides of BBQ Baked Beans, Sweet Corn on the Cob, Chicken Tenders, Soul Fries w/chili and cheese and the Apple Cobbler for dessert.  Seeing all that food in writing is definate validation that  Ross and I were  in need of serious \"comforting.\"  Our bill came to $30. 

The service was a little slow, but Chef Lynn was the only one in the kitchen with two youngish/teenage-looking servers out front. We weren't in a rush so it didn't bother us.  I think you have to readjust your timetables when you go for \"Southern\" style cooking - which in some ways is simply a reminder to slow down your life a bit and  just enjoy living."}
{"text":"I was dying for chicken like my grandmother made. I'm from back east and didn't know a thing about soul food. The chicken was just like hers. I thought it was great."}
{"text":"I just ate @ Yo Mama's! - for the first time and had a very good experience.  The ambiance inside was MUCH better than expected and very nice.  Service was also very good.  
For dinner, I had the smoked salmon and 2 sides for $10.95.  The salmon was good, and for the 2 sides I had the collard greens cooked with turkey bacon (Awesome), and the yams (cooked with cinnamon - best damn yams I've ever had!).  I also tried the mac & cheese which was homemade and Very good too.  If you live in, or are visiting the area (24th St & Roeser (1/2 mi north of Southern)) - you should pay them a visit.  They are open late.  I'm a big fan of Yo Mama's!"}
{"text":"This place was okay. I got the signature \"Chicken and Waffles\" and it was pretty unique for someone from the East Coast.  I never thought having a whole chicken and actual breakfast waffles would be a good combination, but it was! The waffles were really good!"}
{"text":"This is definitely not my favorite soul food restaurant in the valley. The service was ok. It really seems like it is run by 2 or 3 teenagers. They don't do a bad job, but they do not do a great job either. The food was ok. I honestly was hoping to see some grill marks."}
{"text":"I was a fan - the turkey leg and greens were outstanding, however a friend just told me they were closed.   I called their number, and it is no longer in service.   Hopefully, this is a temporary situation."}
