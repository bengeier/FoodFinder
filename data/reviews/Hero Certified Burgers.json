{"text":"The first hero that opened up and it is still the best one!
The best food option in Hazelton Lanes and in YorkVille.
The staff is always friendly too."}
{"text":"When i first moved to Yonge and St. Clair i was really excited to have a Hero burger close by.  i remember really liking their burgers the odd time that i've had them back in Etobicoke.  I went a few times but really wasn't that impressed.  Nothing wrong with the food, it just didn't make me want to come back.

After a long break from eating there we decided to try it again. We sat on the patio where we sat right beside their 'conditional pass' sign from their Toronto Public Health inspection. 

Won't be going back."}
{"text":"I went to this resturant this weekend and it was absolutely amazing! The food was great and the service was awesome Really nice atmosphere with the music and cleanness."}
{"text":"This is the first Hero Burger restaurant. It's in Hazelton Lanes, a swanky shopping centre, and it's by far the best one.

They keep crappy hours, like they close at 5PM every day and open at 11AM, and they are certainly not fast, but in comparison to the other locations, they seem to be the only ones who've ever actually eaten the product, or know it at all.

The service is great and even the cooks are personable.
This is where you go for your first. Once you're in love, then you can start trying on the others."}
{"text":"Totally unimpressed with this burger.  The meat was gray .... yes, gray .... and fairly tasteless.  The sauce was OK, but made me think McD's, and the bun tasted rather stale.  Thankfully I didn't order the fries - my friend did, and they weren't anything special either.  What a waste of money....."}
{"text":"I was there today and found that everything ran well,  It has been open 3 days and honestly I though it was great. People clearly don't understand the teething problems to start a new company. I loved it and I feel its welcome to our area!

Love the food!"}
{"text":"I have come here three times in the last week around 5 to 630pm. Its usually not busy at all when I arrive. I was served by a very helpful lady and gentleman around these times on different days, who have helped make some delicious selections. I havent noticed much of a delay in how long it takes them to make the food, I was actually pleasantly surprised when they brought the food to my table with condimenta and napkins. I would recommend this location because of its service and they are not cheap with their ingredients (cheese, bacon, etc) like many other places. I enjoy places where you get what you pay for like this."}
{"text":"The burgers are fine. But they are SLOW. Really slow. But... they are also the only burger and fries immediately in the vicinity. Both the McDonald's and the Harvey's across from the ROM were sacrificed to build condo towers. If the Harvey's were still open, I'd go there instead -- cheaper and the food was better."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers and great service. They also offer smaller burgers ideal for kids. Definitely worth the trip."}
{"text":"This was my first time going to Hero's. It was just alright.... actually make that sub-par. The burger was kinda greasy and they messed up my order. 

I went there for lunch, then later in the evening I felt really sick to my stomach. I was sick for 2 days. I think Hero's was the culprit. :-("}
{"text":"Terrible service and terrible burgers. I ordered two burgers with fries and two milkshakes. The burgers I received were wet and soggy, the fries bland and limp. There were also missing ingredients that I had  paid for. Not only that, my milkshakes were forgotten by the delivery driver and they refused to send us them after we called, telling us their delivery time period was over; despite still being listed as open on just eat. To be honest im not sure what was worse, the customer service or the burgers, either way they both left a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"My friends on facebook are consistently checking-in to various Hero Burgers throughout the city, and for awhile I've been successfully ignoring them, and subsiding curiosity.  But damn I was in the area and I got hungry.

This place is also a salad place?  There is a big screen television for all the football fans, and that's as much as I can say about the d√©cor.  
There are two girls behind a small counter, and with their pearly white teeth, they'll take your order with a big freaking smile.  I'm trying to understand the menu and the options that apparently comes with the burgers, but I just ended up getting the 'signature' burger because it was easier.  I also ordered the poutine.    
Fill your own drinks, and table service for my order...reasonable for the $18 price.  

The burger was prime, I understand now why people snap crackle & pop for this franchise.  Yummy yo!  Poutine, well to be fair...there is no such thing as real poutine in Toronto.

Just a completely normal experience.  Completely acceptable for a sandwich joint.


Not gonna lie, I checked in."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers!!!
We were looking for a place to eat in the area and saw this new place. Turns out they were open just a few days ago. We were welcomed right away from the counter \"welcome to hero burger\"  which I have to say doesn't happen anymore. As it was our first time they kindly explained that we could pick from one of their signature burgers or we could build our own. I took the 8 ounce and the sweet potato fries. It's  other your typical fast food place. It took less than 10 minutes for the kitchen to prepare the food which is a great sign as I'm sure this meant that it was cooked fresh and not reheated. I easy blown away by the taste. You can tell they only use fresh ingredients and honestly for the price compared to the other handful of other burger shops and artisanal burger restaurants in the area this blows the rest out of the water. I highly recommend that you give this place a try you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"New burger joint established right in front of the Concordia Hall building to obviously attract all the students possible in the vicinity. The prices are a bit above average for fairly above average burgers. So, all in all, fairly priced. Patties are slightly overcooked, which I personally prefer. You've been warned if you prefer juicy burgers though!

The service is supremely adequate and charming but I suspect it's mostly due to it being new. The place is nice, spacious and clean as well.

Possibly the most cringe-worthy name I've ever seen in my life for a burger joint though. Zero effort put into the name and the logo."}
{"text":"While it's cool to have a halal 100% angus beef burger, I do think the burger is a little bland. Add lots of sauces for flavor."}
{"text":"Only one person in the kitchen, long wait for single burger. Ordered Signature Burger, to go and it had no toppings on it when I opened it later. Meat is good, but how do you mess up such a simple order."}
{"text":"Getting into the parking lot from the busy intersection can be difficult. But I would say, the overall experience is worth it.

When I first walked in, no one was at the register but someone eventually came out and took our order. It was hard to hear him and it became confusing. However, another cashier came out and was very nice and clear. He was interested in what we thought of the food and was friendly. No one was rude and the overall appearance was very clean and well taken care of.

The food was very good. I order the Vegetarian Soul burger and the Classic Poutine. They give you a generous amount of toppings and a decent sized poutine. The patty in the soul burger tasted almost like meat and kept together really well.

I would return and recommend this as a great burger place."}
{"text":"The service here is 10/10. Location is also great as it's right beside Concordia,  very convenient for students.  The prices for the burgers are pretty reasonable considering there are a few gourmet burgers in the area that charge significantly more and don't have the options you can get here. The zipp if anyone is wondering is a vanilla ice cream swirl with a few choices of toppings.  I wouldn't say it is worth the 2.99 but if you're coming here it's probably for the burgers. Overall very friendly and helpful staff and the food was great."}
{"text":"This location really surprised us pleasantly.  We definitely weren't expecting a tasty burger place located on the bottom level of the higher end Hazelton Lanes, which is surrounded by expensive restaurants, shops, exclusive retirement homes just outside in Yorkville.  A hidden eatery inside this shopping centre, Hero Burger had pretty much complete access to all the tables and chairs set outside in the indoor courtyard.  It was fairly quiet during lunch hour in the middle of the work week.  The hustle and bustle of Yorkville and the Bloor Street traffic certainly didn't seem to affect the indoor space of this mall.

The burgers were very tasty.  We came here on the $4.50 combo wagjag deal which was accepted without any issues.  I would actually have never even known that this location existed if it was not for the deal.  The 4oz burger came quickly.  While the patty was thinner than other gourmet burger places, I had no issues with it - there really wasn't any need to leave completely overstuffed.  Served on a toasty sesame bun with some sort of mayo sauce, it was delicious and did not leave a nasty after-taste nor an I-am-so-thirsty feeling like a typical McDonald's ick-burger.  The fries were so-so.  A bit oily and not at all crispy.

I would definitely come here again for a quiet, delicious lunch!"}
{"text":"Burgers and sweet potato fries are amazing. The packaging is very cool. I believe it's called the pleat pack by Greendustries. But it's always good no matter what kind of toppings you get on it."}
{"text":"boo,  not worth it.
boo.
it looks liek it's gonna be awesome when you see all the options, then you actually see the meat and the way they put it together.  so below average for the price.  go to burger king if you want a burger."}
{"text":"Just found out recently about this burger place. I went with my sister. The service is very good. The food is exceptional. One the best burgers ever. The fries are definitely delicious. Our sodas were watered. So on Facebook, I gave 4 stars, someone contacted me to ask what can be done to increase my star. I told them about their soda. I found this to be a super good service. I haven't been back yet... but I can't wait to try again... maybe next time 5 stars."}
{"text":"Nice to eat there. 

Well, it is a good restaurant to have burger and fries although they do not serve promptly however taste of burger and other stuff is really good, I assure you that it's much better than Big smoke burger also this is only place to eat in mall... 

Totally recommend you to eat there but be cautious at your time, it takes time to serve it."}
{"text":"Being vegan, I'm always on the lookout for delicious veggie burgers. I even have a gallery of veggie burgers on Facebook that compares the different veggie burgers offered in your typical meat burger franchise, like Licks, KFC, and Burger King. So far, none of the veggie burgers I've tried have surpassed my beloved Lick's Nature Burger.. until I met Hero Burger's \"Soul Burger.\" It was SOOOOO delicious. The veggie patty was thick, juicy and very tasty. Hero Burger also offers a wide range of FREE quality condiments that other places might charge you for, I ended up loading my burger up with most of their vegan condiments, such as jalapeno peppers, red onions and creole mustard. The owner was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu, he told me that the thin burger bun is vegan friendly, which is perfect because the thinner bun has less calories than the standard bun. Less calories and vegan = true perfection. 

Since I was working overtime and the boss was paying for my co-worker's and my meal, we made it a combo, which came with fries or onion rings and a fountain drink. Next to veggie burgers, my second love is onion rings, so I got the onion rings and they were SO good. They were thick and crispy, fried to perfection. I'm not a big fan of fountain drinks, so I just picked a random soda that I haven't tried before and had a couple sips. 

I would definitely come back to Hero Burger for their Soul Burger and Onion Rings, probably not together because that's too much food in one sitting. The price is pretty fair for the quality and quantity of the food you receive at Hero Burger, it's actually quite a steal!

(I think this location provides the best service and the food quality is consistently good. Plus, the owner is super nice and cooks the food himself most of the time... -probably because I tend to visit him near closing, which is 7PM on weekdays)."}
{"text":"This has got to be one of the worst burgers I've ever had in my life. I don't usually leave bad reviews because I try not focus on the negatives but I can't let this one go. 
Maybe I visited on an off day but It was just bad. The meat was rubbery and dry and tasteless. The sauces and the ingredients were not fresh at all. 
I added guacamole to my burger and you couldn't even taste the guacamole. 
The custom hero sauce is basically salad dressing. 
The cheese doesn't taste like cheese.
I never ended up eating the whole thing which is always sad.

The prices are just too high for what it is and I was really let down by this place. Might give it another go with people who enjoyed this place. They will know what to order."}
{"text":"The most disappointing experience with food/take out we've ever come across!! If I could put 0 starts I would!

 first impression was... impressive, the options seemed endless! Gluten free, vegetarian, even seafood! The place seemed nice....

-our experience-
After a very long and exhausting day, from work, to dealing with our little kids and schools and after school karate, and driving around all day, it was just one of those nights where we had no time to make dinner, and excitedly decided to try out this new hero burger!

My husband ran inn and placed our order, (hoping it wouldn't  take too long)....while I waited in the car with our exhausted and grumpy and very hungry children! Luckily the place didn't seem so busy....... Or it seemed that way... 
After about 15 min wait, the girl at the front asks my husband what he was waiting for?!?.. He mentioned 4 burgers and fries Etc....
She walks away... Steps outside, returns and continues to serve others who seem to come and go, come and go, come and GO....and in between she would step outside again and again..:every so often.... 

-Aporx 30minutes inn... My husband was approached by one of the other customers who asks ' wow! Are you still here waiting!?' (Meanwhile I'm still waiting with very hungry and very tiered children!!!)
Yeh! 3o minutes of waiting and still nothing, he approaches the young 'lady' (who seemed to be stoned! ) and asks where his order was?? She asks him WHat order? And what was it that he was waiting for?!?!?
(As if that,  has not been discussed, as IF he didn't place the order, with HER!) 
Anyways... After expressing his frustration and yet another reminder that our young children were waiting to eat...... She made every excuse in the book, the printer broke, the order didn't go through to the kitchen... once confronted, finally promises to make it... BUT after 30 minutes and the fact that he had reminded her of his order at least once... We no longer wanted it! We just couldn't wait ANYMORE!!!
The end result was that he demanded our money back!! Since our order was never even placed from their end!! Angry, tiered and still hungry at nearly 9PM! We had to take our poor kids to McDonald's! (Which I hate doing!) 
Thanks hero burger! Very very disappointed in the Terrible staff! 
Who does that anyways? Very unprofessional! And disgusting attitude!
One of the worse locations from our experience!"}
{"text":"I feel like a slight trader to my vegetarianism by commenting on this place.  I'm not a vegetarian-thumper (similar to a bible-thumper), or anti-meat, I'm all about free choice, my choice just happens to be the minority vote.

This store is pretty sleek looking. The menu is pretty big and bold. Prices were a little up there for a burger joint, but keep in mind these were hearty burgs. They did have a vegetarian option, sadly I didn't notice until everyone was almost done their meal (and I got full on the fries). Next time... 

Fries were pretty crispy and delish piping hot, but by the end, not so great. I much prefer cold Swiss Chalet fries, but that's another review.. OR IT IS?"}
{"text":"This location is absolutely terrible. Frozen sweet potato fries served up with no taste. The burgers look and taste awful. The entire menu is a Sysco system processed food nightmare. Honestly folks don't eat at this place!"}
{"text":"Heard the hype about this place while on a trip to Toronto this year but didn't have the chance to try. First off, great service at the Bishop location. The woman behind the cash was very helpful, patient and brings you the food while you're seated. I love that the menu has the calorie-count of each menu item. You can choose your protein, bread, cheese (extra cost),  toppings (some included, some not) and sauce. I ordered the grilled chicken breast on sesame bun, with fried onions (extra), lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, guacamole (extra), spicy sauce and hero sauce. $10.80 may seem a lot for a burger but it was deliciously perfect! Juicy and spicy, the chicken was tender and I would order it again. I also got to try the hero burger which was good but i think i'd prefer it well done... their sweet potato fries were perfect. I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly the poutine was very delicious, and the veggie burger on the gluten free bun was amazing."}
{"text":"This is a brand new location. However the staff needs a lot more training. Orders took forever, staff was making the burgers with their bare hands while wiping nose and face. Wasn't pleasant to see that as a few guests asked for refunds."}
{"text":"Ordered two burgers to go. We drove back home only to realize that they gave me a wrong burger. It would have been okay if I just ordered one with basic toppings, but I paid for premium toppings. I called the store right away, they offered me to make a new one if I come back. Btw the burger I got was so sad...just a patty with ketchup, some creamy sauce, and red onion. I was too lazy to drive all the way back. Not going back ever."}
{"text":"Overall was very disappointed in this franchise, felt the burgers are way overpriced and for what we got I didn't appreciate what I had. I don't think I will ever return, There is nothing about this place that would make me want to return or tell someone to try it. I can appreciate the franchise owners reaching out and offering to buy a burger and for that I will add 2 stars to my rating but will decline the offer of a free meal as I said was not overly impressed with the food"}
{"text":"Mmm... who doesn't love a good burger?
But when that good burger is an OUTSTANDING burger, then it is worth talking about!

We visited the first Hero Burger branch in Montreal on a Friday after work. Inside, it is smaller than the Toronto branches that I've been to but it is cosy and has the same theme and menu. 
Despite having opened a month or two ago, it already seemed popular with nearly all the tables full. We were given a very warm welcome by manager Yusuf and were impressed by his service and hospitality.

It wasn't too difficult deciding on what to have... you choose your patty size (6-10oz), choice of bread (healthier options available), cheese (mm blue cheese!) and choice of sauces, salads, toppings and sides. If you get stuck deciding on how to build your burger, go for a ready-made combo which is what I did. I  went for an 8oz, named 'The Hero' I believe and changed the cheddar cheese for blue cheese. 
The combination was definitely delicious - you could definitely taste the quality beef and ingredients - very fresh and gourmet compared to its competitors. 
I loved the fries but missed the super-cool automatic drinks machine that they have at the Toronto branches. Maybe they will introduce it soon?
Price-wise it is reasonable, similarly priced to its competitors but can get higher if extras are added.

To top it all off, Yusuf let us try a complimentary Nutella Sundae which was absolutely delicious. I love when ice-cream tastes more milky than just sugar and this had the texture and taste of frozen yoghurt almost. The added Nutella just brought that extra wow-factor!

Overall, loved the place, the quality of the burgers and service. They are open 'til late so we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I tried the Heavy Hitter Burger, it tastes like a Big Mac in addition to all the healthy qualities they claim: hormones or antibiotics free..."}
{"text":"Not happy with this location. They guy who I think is either the manager or the owner of the location got the order wrong and wouldn't change it afterwards either- even though the cook didn't start to prepare the burgers. I ordered a chicken deluxe and 2 soul burgers and he for some reason added another soul burger. I told Him repeatedly it was just 3 BURGERS that I wanted but he still got it wrong. So I ended up paying for the extra burger that I did not need. He seemed like the guy who was just trying to make another sale. This location was so cold and clearly they did not have the heater on cause ate with our jackets on. It Would have probably been warmer in the car. The only reason why I'm giving two stars is because of the food actually tasted good. They could have used more guac for the veggie burger that I ordered especially because it was a dollar extra so they were kind of stingy on that part. Overall, there are much better locations that I've been to."}
{"text":"Awful!
Pre-formed rubbery burger patties with zero flavor. 
The fries are soggy and under-cooked.
Reminds me of the tasteless Harvey burgers I had as a teenager, when Harvey's was the only burger place (other than Steak n Burger) in town.
Toronto in 2009 deserves better."}
{"text":"This was the first, and best, hero burger in the city. 

The beef is higher quality and they have some good sauces (the maple chipotle is a personal favourite). Nothing spectacular, but it's clearly a better option than fast food burgers."}
{"text":"I had a Soul Burger combo (vegetarian burger) today. Not bad actually, I thought the burger was pretty tasty and good value for what you get. I preferred it to the meat burgers I've had here."}
{"text":"This location is on the corner of a busy intersection. At least the interior was clean and modern. 

Whe we arrived we had to wait a few minutes before someone popped out of the back to come over and take our order.

When we were ordering the cashier kept pointing to the menu behind him when we asked about toppings, very unprofessional.

My daughter ordered the vegeterian soul burger, poutine and a drink. It was all a hit so at least the food was good."}
{"text":"Wish the burgers were juicier,
Hope they'll stop overcooking them.

The burger patty needs to become the Hero.

Good service though, nice owners."}
{"text":"Overpriced tasteless burger. Fries are no better. Don't bother with this place. It's a big disappointment. Brought my family here. We were all disappointed and it cost more than $60 even with coupons."}
{"text":"Was in the area and hungry.  Went in because I saw that HeroBurger has 'think pink' campaign supporting breast cancer in the window.  Staff was wearing pink t-shirts and suggested that for $1 I could a Pink Bun with money towards the campaign.   I like that !!
Lunch was Great.  Burger was Great, and I like the music playing in the restaurant.  Comfortable seating, Free WiFi, and free refills.   The place fills my needs."}
{"text":"One of the best locations I've been to! I have had some bad experiences at hero burger where the food wasn't so fresh. Everything was on point at this location. The guy at cash was very friendly and helpful. He went out of his way to provide good service. The food was also fresh and tasted great. 10/10"}
{"text":"Great help at counter , Gluten free buns available , great tasting food , great options , lots of toppings , healthy choices  like salads instead of fries if you want , clean store , good seating , food brought out to the table in large order instead of us standing to wait . We liked it !!"}
{"text":"An easy choice for take-out as the place is pretty close by and the food is quite good. A little bit overpriced but that is not the issue! We have ordered food from this location 5 times in the past 6 months and on 3 occasions, including last night, the cheese has been left off the burgers. Very disappointing especially when we pay extra for these toppings... The last time we returned, and they re-made the order with cheese and an apology. But we do not the hassle of returning every time. That was our last visit."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Hero Burger as a chain.  But, this location was a bit disappointing.  On two occasions they messed up my order, and the staff still seem like they have a lot to learn.  Maybe it's because they just opened, but hope they get things sorted out soon."}
{"text":"Unimpressed. Basically you're paying gourmet burger joint prices for quality that doesn't even match Harvey's.

The Soul Burger, aka veggie burger, is $7.79 with fries and a drink. I upgraded the fries to a Poutine for an extra $2. The veggie burger was a thin, bland patty with hardly any toppings. I asked for extra pickles and still only got about 3 tiny slices of pickle and they were the cross-sectional slices rather than the larger lengthwise slices. Lame.

The fries were undercooked and the gravy was bad. At least they use proper cheese curds in the poutine.

Some of my coworkers got the meat burgers and they were equally unimpressive. Thin, tasteless, pre-formed patties.

If you're looking for a quick and cheap burger go to Harvey's. For a proper gourmet burger go to Craft Burger or one of the many other gourmet burger joints in town. Don't bother with Hero Burger. It's the worst of both worlds."}
{"text":"Every time I see \"Hero\" sign I'm getting really excited - they are a premium burger chain after all... However, reality is different: they are premium priced burger chain with very inconsistent quality. Now, when I'm saying quality - it's more about the way it's cooked (and seasoned). The patty is usually thick, juicy but completely tasteless. Salt and pepper are nowhere to be found. Fries are not bad, however the whole thing is not good enough for the price."}
{"text":"The original Hero Certified Burgers.  Nothing beats the original!  Friendly staff and of course who can pass up on their awesome home made sauces?  Whenever I'm in town I always make sure to stop by for lunch."}
{"text":"Turkey cranberry is my burger of choice (it's called \"Fiesta\" but let's forget about that), and it's so good. The staff is so friendly!"}
{"text":"This is the new burger on Bishop, the hero burger shop. 

They offer a real personalized burger of your choice : you can choose from beef patty to bun to ingredients and toppings. On top of that you can choose a side dish, fries, poutine,  sweet potato and salad. 

I ordered their hero burger with their famous hero sauce and as a side, a poutine to fill in my crave. 

Their burger are juicy, my only complaint is their poutine. They put too much gravy sauce on it and it's pretty sure it has been sitting in the kitchen for awhile because the fries aren't crispy anymore which is a bit of a turnoff."}
{"text":"This Hero Burger has not been too busy whenever I've visited. It's been a decent spot for me to visit knowing I'd have to wait quite a while for food at Scallywag's next door during big games. 
There are only two people working the whole place on some weekends, and they have a second counter selling some salads, bagels etc. 
The burger is the usual Hero fare; better than your average fast food grind, but nothing to really write home about. Though I guess I just did."}
{"text":"I have been looking forward to coming here since they opened and I'm very glad that I did! Upon entering, I was greeted with a smile. The owners are currently running the establishment and they were beyond nice and helpful - the service was excellent. I really hope that the new employees are as kind and accommodating. Additionally, the restaurant was very clean, and tables were wiped down immediately after they were used. 

Before coming, I read that their veggie burger and GF bun are both vegan and celiac friendly, which was confirmed when I asked the staff. Basically, there's a burger here for everyone! Their prices were also reasonable. Finally, the food was great. Both my friend and I were very impressed. 

I highly recommend that anyone who enjoys a good burger gives this place a try!"}
{"text":"I don't often review chain restaurants because I wrongfully always assume that the quality and experience aren't noticeably different between them. I was wrong. I've been to several Hero locations and this is by far the best one I've been to. 

We've been here twice and got the gluten free soul burger. The burgers tasted outstandingly fresh and it was evident that it was assembled with care. Service was great both times too. Bonus: amazingly clean bathrooms (yes, it matters). 

Casual fast dining need not be overlooked. Simple = good, sometimes, and this Hero Burger's got your simple fix back."}
{"text":"I've been to a few Hero Burger chain's and I found myself to liking only this location. There's a ton of parking and it's located at one of a major intersection. 
The burgers always taste fresh and it's stacked nicely. I always get the signature burger - I should probably try something new but I just love the taste of this one. 

I usually come here in the evenings on random off days and it's not that busy. Most of the time I come, I see people come in and order to go. I sit in most of the time. The person at the register was very knowledgeable about the menu and usually would tell us what deal ends up being cheaper because my boyfriend is very indecisive. 

Signature burger: recommend to get, my fav.
Heavy hitter: if you're a gymmer and want more cals, get this (basically 2x  the signature)
Classic poutine: not bad, tad salty (fries are ok- they can be better)
Sweet potato fries: very good, crispy and huge portions
Chicken fingers: this is new, pieces are small (6x), lightly seasoned and fried - these are ok)
Tempura zucchini: didn't like this one. zucchinis were too wet so batter was a little soggy. Wouldn't get this next time.

Great burger joint in the north end of Sauga. Would recommend to go!"}
{"text":"Great food and awesome service from Elias. If you are into organic this is the place for you. The blue moon burger is very good. Too bad other places don't promote organic as much as here burger does."}
{"text":"Food is great, staff are friendly and helpful when ordering, but the wait to actually get your food is far too long, hence can only give two stars."}
{"text":"Second time visiting since it opened. Management were very nice. They came to our table twice to ask how everything was and if we needed anything else. Staff are very friendly. Food was great as usual for Hero burger. It's more than a McDonald's burger, but the quality is much better."}
{"text":"less then impressed comes to mind. 
came here to get food, they ran out of pickles, the ran out of poutine cheese, and after taking payment for food and milkshakes, they came back and said the milkshake machine was broken. thankfully we got a refund for the milkshakes, as for the poutine, we were told that we would be compensated for the gravy in order to make us happy for them not having the poutine cheese. after checking my bill, they charged us for the gravy afterall. 
the food is great, but the service is lackluster and great miscommunication is present between the staff and customers, as I experienced this when waiting for our food to be finished. 
it would take a lot for me to come back to this store. 
street parking exists if you can find it, with a pay for parking lot on the opposite end. transit options are the 501 queen streetcar/bus. 

a couple of other better options are in the area."}
{"text":"Pretty cool concept where you can customize you burgers: protein, bun, toppings. 

I had a basic burger and was very satisfied. It looked good and it tasted good too :-)

I would definitely go back again when craving a burger. On the plus side, the meat is claimed to be without hormones or antibiotics which makes it more interesting then other burger joints.

Ps: the zucchini fries are also yummy :-)"}
{"text":"Expensive nickel and dime burger joint.  Pay $$$ for your meat then get an up charge for type of bread, toppings, cheese...all extra.  Plus $3 more if you want fries and a drink.  Get their 4oz special ($7.99 deal) fries, drink, cheese, tomato, relish, onion, mayo included and you'll still leave hungry.  

I will say they have a lot of unique options, one being salmon.  But that's an $8 meat for your sandwich alone haha.  Not what I would expect to pay connected to a gas station.

The environment is very loud and hollow inside with large flat walls for all the noise to bounce from inside."}
{"text":"Outstanding restaurant. Great service, awesome food, and a fun atmosphere!"}
