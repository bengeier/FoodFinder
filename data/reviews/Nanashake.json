{"text":"Super delicious... very filling ... I was already sold when the espresso shot was poured over my nanashake and slowly travelling through the grooves ... but the taste ... yum... a new experience !!"}
{"text":"This place is a must try for anyone that enjoys smoothies period, vegan or not. Their products are simply healthy and delicious! The service was great service, all employees are proud of the product that they sell. It was so good, we ordered another one before leaving. Keep up the great work guys! Definitely recommend it, tried the Original, Chocolate and strawberry one, equally as delicious."}
{"text":"Nanashake at the Veg Festival. 
With three staff members available we were ignored  at the front of the line while one of them was serving promoting half price product to the clients besides us. When we were acknowledged the staff member was rude and refused to sell any products because it was one minute after closing. If they would had said that earlier we wouldn't stayed around standing like idiots. 
Poor customer service"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! We tried the affogato and mint chocolate and my god it was so good! If you have food allergies do not hesitate to contact them, they responded to my question very quickly!  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. From the \"vegan appeal\" to the appetizing IG photos, I thought this would be my new go-to dessert place. I sampled several of their flavours and they really just tasted like frozen banana. I ended up purchasing the pina colada feature flavour and found the banana to be quite overpowering. I would assume the Dole dessert machine could make similar frozen treats. However, if you enjoy the banana taste and the vegan appeal, then by all means!"}
{"text":"Have been going to this place since it opened nearly two years ago. I've been dozens of times and it's good every time! I go every chance I get and have introduced many people to this place - everyone loves it! 

Recently the launched their \"NanaFit\" which is an even healthier offering, but still so good!"}
{"text":"I tried their dairy-free, vegan soft serve and my first thought was, \"I think this just added a year to my life.\" It tasted so fresh and light and nourishing. I had the Strawberry Funshine and Chocolate Delight, and both had subtle but good flavours. You'll also taste the banana base, which I like.

The person at the counter was really friendly and helpful. He offered me samples to make sure I got what I liked the most. I ended up changing my order from Rosey Pistachio because it turns out I'm not a huge fan of the rose water flavour. I left happy with my end choices.

It was about $6 for soft serve and for the quality, it's worth it. They also have shakes, popsicles, lattes and cakes."}
{"text":"I love to see new vegan places pop up in and around Toronto! Especially in an area that doesn't have many dedicated vegan places. The spiced date was very good and I would recommend it! The service was very friendly and they make everything daily at their location. I think in the future they would benefit greatly by adding a coconut soft serve onto their menu. But overall it was nice, the staff was friendly and as a vegan I do not hold it against them that they did once use non-vegan topping, although I am glad they took them away. I love supporting vegan businesses in Toronto, and the product was good so I will be back."}
{"text":"I struggled with the rating on this one, but I really can't give it more than 2 Stars. 

Yes, as shown in other reviews, the portions are very small, the cup itself is very small, and even a full cup contains less than a medium DQ cone, for a MUCH higher price. 
Listen, I get it that they obviously need a high margin to keep a one-trick-pony store like this afloat, hire staff, pay the rent, but $7 for a banana and a handful of berries?
Still, IF the product was mind-blowingly good, then I could excuse the price, pay the extra, and enjoy the occasional yummy treat.
Sadly, the product is just okay.

I am an omnivore, but I cannot tell you how excited my vegan friend was that this place was right across the street from where I live, she could not wait to come visit and try the vegan softserve.
Between the two of us we purchased 2 double flavour cups so we could enjoy 4 different flavours and share, but sadly, even she had to admit that everything tasted fine, but only \"just fine\". The basic banana was the best, pistachio was disappointing, chocolate was bland and boring. Overall, unimpressed.
But her disappointment was disheartening. In the end, she decided she would continue making her own smoothies and soft serve with her Yonanas machine, in more fun flavours, all for under a buck for a much bigger serving."}
{"text":"This place is amazing !!!!  I can't say t enough. The staff are the ones who make the entire visit. They offer to let you try ANY flavour you want before you order to make sure you like it. Don't be put off by the location - the mall is under construction but just enter from Beecroft Street. You won't be disappointed. 

The product is out of this world delicious. I ordered the Original with Blondie squares mixed in and my friend ordered the mango/strawberry with Blondie squares, biscotti, and mango syrup mixed in. We were both super pleased and satisfied. 

We will definitely be back and recommend it to everyone, not just vegans."}
{"text":"Gluten free, dairy free and vegan \"ice cream\".  Sounds very exciting but I have to say I was a little bit disappointed.  The people at the shop are super nice and let me sample some flavours first!  The date one was strange (which they warned me about, so I'm SO happy they told me to sample it).  I ended up getting the pistachio rose and strawberry.  When they told me I could choose 2 flavours I thought it would be like soft serve and a twist style.  But instead they just put one flavour on top of the other.  They were both not super sweet which was nice.

While I didn't really know what to expect because it was my first time having ice cream like this, I can definitely say that I prefer ice cream or gelato.  It's also quite expensive for what you are getting, so I won't be back.  BUT this place is the healthy alternative so I think it's a great choice if you are actually lactose intolerant and have celiac disease :)"}
{"text":"This vegan ice cream joint is definitely a \"hidden\" gem. Located at 4950 yonge, which is inside the green curvy (bamboo) looking towers byYonge and Sheppard, they are the first eatery to open in the currently desolated food court on the main floor.

The ice cream is made fresh to order. They use a banana base for all their vegan ice creams. The pistachio was great and definitely worth the price as it had lots of pistachio nuts. The original was good too, but it can disappoint those who define vanilla as original. The original flavour here has a overpowering banana flavour, which is delicious if you are someome who enjoys that!"}
{"text":"I'm assuming family owned. The children helped their parents which I thought was cute. The store is really cute and their menu looks delicious. I tried the pistachio bar and the banana bread milkshake, they were good! The owner is really friendly. I'm not a huge fan of certain almond milk (I only like one brand so far), so next time I might ask for no almond milk in my shake. I would come back to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"A very refreshing snack or an after lunch dessert. Unfortunately they don't appear to stay open late. 

Who would think frozen bananas would be this good. Naturally sweet and creamy smooth; and it's completely natural. 

Plenty of selections and toppings. Great reason to visit to try them all."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place since their pictures looked so good but sadly, was disappointed with the popsicles :( the pistachio one tastes nothing like pistachio and has a strange fragrance that turned me off. I couldn't finish it, the popsicle was really dry and kinda crumbly."}
{"text":"I had been really tempted to try this place, after I learnt of it on Yelp. Store is located under the Emerald Park condo and shares the floor with many other eateries.

The owner was very friendly. As I walked in, he greeted me with a smile. He introduced me the products they have to offer, which are frozen yogurt, popsicle and milkshare (all made with frozen banana) He also offered a few samples for me to try. I purchased two single servings: strawberry funshine and nana-pick (should be of chocolate, can't recall the ingredients exactly) 

I have to say, this store is Independent (I assume it is) so it has to have something special to set itself apart from other dessert franchises/chains. The taste is great, store clean and service top-notch, but I do find the price to be a little high (4.99 for a single serving) for what it is and wonder how many people would go for it.

Still I hope they do well, as I think frozen banana yogurt is a very interesting idea to implement."}
{"text":"Got their banana based fro yo it was okay. There's not much taste to it. Don't think I'll come back sorry."}
{"text":"This place is a little confusing to find on your first visit, but it's worth the trek. Nanashake somehow tastes even better than it looks in the promo photos. I had the rosey pistachio and chocolate delight with pistachio on top and it was incredible. It's completely vegan and even the spoons they use are environmentally friendly. Plant based, dairy free, gluten free and definitely a hidden gem."}
{"text":"the location was a search! The place was located within an unfinished condominium. I had to ask couple of people where it was. Other than that, the store was cute, the walls were filled with colourful drawings. And the employees were friendly and explaining the ingredients within their famous ice cream. 

The pricing and the amount you get is disappointing. The price for a small is around 6$ and the large is up to 9$. Not including topics. Which is quite ridiculous for a ice cream. 6$ for the amount me and my friend got was super small. Based on the picture from the menu, we only got half of the amount. 

The ice cream was good, but definitely not worth the price. In my opinion, It was good to try but won't be back again. :/"}
{"text":"I love how the other reviewers only ever had one review and it was for this place...makes you wonder if the reviews are genuine or just friends of the owner. The soft serve is average, I get the same from my yonanas machine. It's just frozen bananas mixed with a few toppings...easy to make  at home. What really ticks me off is they claim to use the finest ingredients yet they don't use organic and/or fair trade ingredients? Using the logic that the \"finest ingredients\" means handpicked themselves, I guess my yonanas soft serves are from the finest ingredients since I pick them out myself too! Honestly, save your money. This place is nothing too special, just get a yonanas machine and add the toppings yourself for much less. 

This company has claimed to be 100% vegan and then admitted that their toppings were not and it was a mistake. Sorry? You mean you didn't know 100% meant everything? 

They also claim to use the finest ingredients but hand picking bananas at metro is not \"the finest ingredients\". 

These claims are false and their product is average. Save your money. Will not be supporting this business until it lives up to its claims...that means fair trade, organic and 100% vegan."}
{"text":"Nanashake is located about 5 minutes from York Mills station so I decided to stop here last week on my way home from downtown. I'd discovered their Instagram feed a little while ago and had been drooling over it for months. Every vegan knows about banana soft serve or 'nice cream', it's one of my go-to breakfasts so I was interested to try it as more of a dessert-type treat. The shop was a lot smaller than I expected, which is not necessarily a bad thing but I had to pay for street parking (luckily it wasn't too much). The interior of this place is absolutely adorable. I took a while to decide what I wanted but ended up deciding on an affogato cone. The first thing I noticed was the size - the amount of ice cream I received was nothing like the pictures I'd seen on their Instagram page. My tiny cone cost me $6.75. If I were to make the exact thing at home it would cost me less than a dollar. Of course, I wouldn't be as opposed to spending that much had the quality or amount of ice cream been up to expectations but it just wasn't anything special. I'd like to return sometime to maybe try something else but for now I think I'm going to stick to homemade as it's cheaper and more customizable."}
{"text":"Was craving some ice cream and thought this place might be cool to check out. Boy, was I wrong. I hope I just got a bad batch, otherwise anyone coming here is basically paying to eat card board. Not trying to be dramatic but when they gave me a wooden spoon to eat the soft serve with, I half wondered if they just chucked in a few spoons to mix with my soft serve. It was that bad. It actually tasted like cardboard to me.

I tried affogato (coffee) and chocolate flavors in a medium cup and it cost almost $10. I was so disappointed in taste, I couldn't even finish it and threw it out in the trash. In conclusion, won't be returning and definitely don't recommend."}
{"text":"This is my go to dessert destination/obsession. I love this place so much and have tried everything on the menu. 
Nana Pops: They're all good, but my personal fav is the chocolate peanut better pop!

Bananza: Chocolate mixed with cookie dough is the bomb. Add some whipped cream and almond biscotti and you've got a masterpiece.

Soft serve: so many good ones. When I need a caffeine fix, I love my Affogato. Also, love their strawberry funshine (with sprinkles) and chocolate. Also love the mango!

Aside from the awesome food, the people here are crazy nice and really chill folks. Highly recommend it to all you foodies!"}
{"text":"It may be pricey but I really enjoyed their strawberry soft serve. I would definitely go back. Don't go there if you're allergic to nuts- everything contains nuts."}
{"text":"Just stopped by Nanashake on the way home. Easy to find as it's close to Yonge and Sheppard. I ordered the affagato flavor and it was delicious. Very creamy and the espresso shot was made fresh to pour over. The staff are also very nice and friendly. 
However on the downside, the price was a tad high, almost double of a regular ice cream scoop and the portion was a tad small for $6. However, as there aren't many options for folks who can't enjoy dairy, I will be back to try their popsicles as there were a variety of flavors and more reasonably price around $3."}
{"text":"Delicious vegan dessert!

I ordered the Strawberry Funshine which came in an incredibly cute cup! The soft serve had a nice creamy texture that was also firm at the same time. I loved how the sweetness was subtle and that I could taste all the natural flavours from the banana and strawberries. After finishing the entire cup, I felt refreshed and it didn't leave a heavy feeling as ice cream would.

If you're in the North York area, I suggest you try Nanashake for yourself because not only is it very delicious, it's a healthy dessert that will leave you feeling great and satisfied!"}
{"text":"This place is visually super adorable. I got a chocolate peanut butter popsicle and it wasn't amazing. It didn't taste any different than the popsicles i make at home. It was also like $4 which seems a bit pricey for a tiny pop(size of the miniature haagen dazs). I was hoping for something spectacular since its a store that specializes in banana icecream. The pop was also super icy :/ super disappointed. 

I'll probably come here again to try something else."}
{"text":"I was in the vicinity and I decided to check it out. I had a double with Rose Pistachio and Spiced Date. Rose Pistachio is good given that it is non-dairy. I am not a Vegan. I will probably have their single serving next time or their popsicle, if I am in the neighbourhood. It was a tad expensive for what I got. 

The place is a little hard to find. Just go all the way around the building."}
{"text":"Located in the large green condo's food court at Yonge and Sheppard.  Very friendly service.

I tried the Strawberry Funshine.  The frozen dessert is made of frozen bananas instead of ice cream and has a texture similar but better than Yogen Fruz and with a nice banana/ strawberry flavour to it.  Being completely dairy free, I was pleasantly surprised with the taste.  I am mildly lactose intolerant and having a place like this makes me want to have these desserts all the time.  Don't be put off with it being a 'vegan' place, the taste is all there."}
{"text":"So the sad, recent truth is that I've got a mild intolerance for lactose. This doesn't stop me from eating all the cheese and chocolate I want, but I do, when I remember, pop a couple of pills to alleviate the symptoms.

I was curious, then, about a joint that offers dairy-free soft serve and milkshakes. I decided to go with their Banana Bread soft serve, and watched as the helpful clerk mixed it up from scratch.

It's...fine. For what it is, it's probably better than average. It's got a rich banana flavor and it definitely grew on me as I was eating it. But it's a far cry from actual ice cream, ultimately. It's rather thick and chunky, and it's missing that creaminess one tends to expect from soft serve. (It's pretty expensive, too.)

Still, it's nice to know that there are dairy-free options out there for those of us saddled with this particular affliction."}
{"text":"I would give this place 5 stars, but this place always closes before the time they say they'll close on their website!

I live in Scarborough, so travelling to Nanashake is always out of my way - not only by distance, but because it means I'd have to endure the painful traffic on the DVP, especially after work. I try finding time for it every now and then, because their soft serve tastes amazing. The lady owner who served me a couple of times before, when they first opened, was really friendly and nice! The last few times I went, I was served by her staffs.

Pistachio Rose is my favourite flavour by them! I've tried their nanapops, soft serve, and the bananza smoothie in that flavour, and they were all delicious! It does cost extra to dress your smoothie or soft serve with their additional toppings, but it's so worth it. I always add a cookie if I see them in the jar!

The reason why I took off 2 stars, is because they closed on me last Sunday, 15 mins earlier than they claim on their site! I was craving soft serve, but there aren't any vegan ones in my area, so I decided to pay them a visit. I arrived a little later than expected due to traffic, but nonetheless, I managed to get there by 5:46pm (14 mins before closing), but they had already locked their doors and lowered their gates. 

The thing is, even if they would have taken me in as a last customer, and let's just say it would've taken them 10 mins to make my order (exaggerated obviously), they still would've closed on time and before 6. I was so upset because drove there specifically for their delicious soft serve! I knew food stores would clean before the actual closing time, but I've never seen them denied customers before their hour of closing. I have another friend who goes here sometimes telling me the same experience! 

For anybody who comes here, make sure you come at least 30mins before the actual closing time to be on the safe side, or the staffs might turn you away."}
{"text":"I saw this on BlogTo and had to go try it for myself. The location is so hard to find, and it faces the sun when it sets (not sure why anyone sets up a 'ice cream-froyo ' shop facing the sun). Inside the store, it was renovated nicely! They let you sample the flavours, and unfortunately they ran out of the original flavour. Everything is made fresh daily so thats a plus. I tried the strawberry flavour and loved it. However, upon a few more bites, it starts to be less enjoyable.. What stings me the most, is the price. I paid $17 for 2 cups (2 flavours each) and i finished it in a matter of minutes because of the size. A bit expensive if i could say so. I dont think i would return, my wallet would hate me."}
{"text":"Tried both the Spiced date and the chocolate nana shakes.....incredible! And best thing is it's healthy and filling! Wish there are more options like this across TO! I'm an omnivore, and after trying this dessert I'm not sure there's any reason to have dairy ice-cream."}
{"text":"An amazing vegan dessert bar! The owners of this establishment are so welcoming and friendly, it makes your first or 10th visit here an experience to remember! A variety of flavours to choose from plus many toppings to add on top! Peace and plants."}
{"text":"The menu selection here is definitely limited to those who enjoy banana flavour and are not allergic to nuts. I have a hard time understanding why they need to use peanuts in the vanilla flavour (given the number of people with a peanut allergy), but I guess it works for most. The decor is adorable and the owner is responsive on Yelp...I love the concept, just wish they could use another base besides banana!"}
{"text":"If you're ever in the area and looking for a guilt free dessert ice cream option, this is the place. 

Soft serve or popsicle option. It's banana based and obviously no dairy. The Popsicles are vacuum sealed to preserve freshness. 

Oh and the employees and owner? SUPER DOOPER friendly and informative. 
Most def a try place. Even if it's just once."}
{"text":"Dessert was DELICIOUS, filling & of course healthy. Chocolate Mint is fantastic. New favourite dessert spot and super friendly people who will make you feel like hanging out all day."}
{"text":"We liked our soft serve here. The concept is really interesting, vegan, banana based soft serve ice cream with various vegan toppings, and other vegan treats. 

We tried the mint chocolate soft serve which was good but you can taste a mild banana flavour which didn't really go with the mint chocolate but the texture was like real soft serve, thick and creamy, and you feel a bit healthier knowing that it's banana based. 

The price was a bit on the high side, that's my only real major gripe with the place. A small cone ran us over $5.00 which isn't horrendous but it's certainly a novelty price which might not be worth it for what you're getting. 

They also have some ice pops which start at $2.99, as well as baked goods and cakes, all vegan. 

I'd try another flavour or perhaps one of the ice pops but I likely won't make a habit of it just because of the cost. 

The girls working there are really very nice and the little booth is really cute and bright."}
{"text":"I had the pistachio rose with coconut topping in a single serving cup. I enjoyed it's flavour with the banana base and the crunchy coconut texture. 

The price point is definitely something I would treat this as an once in a while special healthy treat instead of somewhere I would go every day."}
{"text":"Overall alright. Ordered a small. Pretty heavy. Flavors were decent. Energetic employees. Could use more Flavors and serving options!"}
{"text":"I come to Nanashake more than I care to admit.

Yes, they are slightly pricier than your average cone at DQ or other ice cream shop, but when you are investing in your health isn't the extra couple of dollars worth it?? When food is cheap it means it is made from cheap, low-quality ingredients that do nothing to benefit your health. To the people complaining of the price - it's the same as saying you are annoyed a fresh, folly-loaded salad is $10 but you can get a McDouble for $2 - duh. Remember, you get what you pay for. Dairy, sugar, artifical flavouring and preservatives are cheap bc they are terrible for you. These guys are using wholesome healthy foods and quality comes at a price.

Everything is freshly made, no preservatives, high quality ingredients, tastes delicious and most importantly, cruelty free (plus the staff are so friendly!).

Definitely worth a visit !"}
{"text":"Nanashake has a cute monkey logo that you'll love!! Everything is banana based and vegan and dairy free! 

It's in a new upcoming area, under a green condo along Shepard and Yonge street. (Back entrance.) 

They share seating with other store owners once they open. It looks like it would be a food court area. 

We were able to try out some flavours before ordering. They only have a selective choices which is easier to decide. I got the strawberry and mint and choco one. It reminded me of a frozen yogurt feel. Each cup is $5 plus taxes. 

The store front is cute and nicely displayed. 

Verdict: I would have like a bit more in my cup as they don't stuff it in. It's dairy free so I love it, but would only go back if I'm in the area. They have a great reward system in place already: buy 5 items get one free. A lot better than most places with buying 10 drinks."}
{"text":"I'm no vegan so I can't really say whether if the taste of this is standard. My boyfriend and I tried the Affogato softserve cup and the Original/Strawberry Sunshine popsicle blend. We couldn't even finish half of it before throwing it out - it had a weird grainy texture and tasted very powdery as an aftertaste. It really didn't sit well in my stomach and for the price, I rather go to one of the many ice cream parlours in Toronto."}
{"text":"This place was really hard to find. So first of all, it's in like the bottom of a condo building and there are shops and a food court. It's located right in the food court. You have to pay for parking unless you come by ttc or live close by. M and I came here on Sunday at 5 and there were two people working. Staff was really friendly and explained how everything works and that they are vegan and gluten free. I had the affogato flavoured ice cream and M had a banana bread shake with a shot of espresso. It was pretty flavourful but I don't think I'd come back only because it's so inconvenient."}
{"text":"A bit pricy for frozen banana mash? 

I would have expected a bigger portion and was a bit disappointed as the product didn't wow me. I was expecting a decent amount of frozen banana similar to what they advertise on the website/ Facebook posts. I honestly think I could have made this with my blender and a few frozen ripe bananas. Not sure if it is demanding a premium to the price because it is vegan, but In the end I felt a bit ripped off."}
