{"text":"I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a new experience. The food is fresh. The drinks are delicious and the service is excellent. This is by far one of my new favorites restaurants. Being a foodie I can confidently say that you will not be disappointed. This place is great!"}
{"text":"A hidden gem in scottsdale! Their happy hour prices are great. I loved their revolving menu of cocktails, the orange beef tacos, goat cheese mouse, fried olives, and Moscow miles. Overall this place had fantastic food for a decent price in a very cool artistic space."}
{"text":"Great food and prices are reasonable! The wait staff was attentive and we loved everything we picked-We will definitely be back to try more!"}
{"text":"From service, to food and ambiance, everything was great! If ur in Scottsdale, definitely pay this place a visit!!"}
{"text":"My wife found this place to celebrate my birthday. We had an awesome server named Tim whose service was excellent. The quality of the food was amazing with excellent flavors. We really enjoyed the grilled octopus, Cornish hen and the orange beef tacos. We ordered the ribeye for dinner and the meat was tender and perfectly cooked. The salmon and the scallops were also excellent. My daughter loved the chocolate mousse desert. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Had a great time! Went with the wife to celebrate 20th year anniversary. Did not disappoint. They have been open only for about 1 month, but seem to have everything together. Drinks were very good.  Friendly, upbeat atmosphere with great mural of Frida Khalo as the center piece!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing food. I went with a large group and was able to try almost everything on the menu. My main course was the duck. Omg, you have to have it the way the chef recommends, medium rare. It was an amazing experience, the server was amazing. The presentation was impressive. I also absolutely loved the octopus. The amazing young chef herself came out and met us. Please come, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch on a Sunday afternoon with my family. Great place with delicious food, awesome service and cool ambiance. We all ordered something different and shared it amongst us...turns out everything was delicious. We ordered the grilled octopus, peach salad, sliders, little taquitos, and a few other things. The prices were fair and the best part everything tasted fresh! Definitely will be coming back to try to the rest of the menu and check out their Flamenco performance!   We didn't mind the TVs as others have mentioned as I can see myself coming here to watch a sporting event and staying away from the rowdy crowds at the other bars.   I really hope the words gets out and people check out this beautiful gem! There's an amazing mural of Frida Kahlo that's must to check out when you go there as well!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch and it was awesome. Had the Benedict it was really good and the lamb bacon is a MUST try! The service and the price point were really good!"}
{"text":"One of the best options in Old town. They grilled octopus is a most. I had been there a few times and they always have the best service."}
{"text":"The food here is out of this world!  My wife and I shared 4 different tapas and each was so flavorful with healthy ingredients. The grilled octopus and the house gyozas were my personal favorites but even the side of roasted vegetables was incredible. Received top notch service from our waiter Tim and the decor and ambience gave a good vibe as well."}
{"text":"This place has soo much potential!  Great decor.  The food was gorgeously plated.    The octopus was very well prepared.  The ceviche was also wonderful.    The sliders were trying too hard.  The meat was difficult  to bite into and chewy.    The gyoza was gorgeous but lacked flavor and texture.   With some updates to the menu this place will be amazing.  I would recommend sticking with traditional tapas.  Adding more Spanish dishes to the menu arroz verde con pollo,  potatas bravas, plantains, stuffed dates, and other authentic dishes that are not represented in the valley (or at least not well by most places)"}
{"text":"Pretty freaking awesome.  First, this was the first weekend the college kids were home so pool parties abound & bars were swingin' with the frat boys in their uniform of tanks & chubbies, drunks falling in the street while many a policeman was watching over the mess. Point is, El Panzon y Frida gave us front row seating to the debacle, not a bad thing, just an entertaining one.   We tried just about everything on the Tapas menu, had some tasty cocktails (Holy Homemade Ice Balls Batman!), dessert..and wine.   There were mouth explosions. The flavors were innovative and fun. The ideas were fresh and modern. The Chef was out of this world.   Tim was our server and he knew everything, he was our favorite person all night, not just because he fed us but because he had some important product knowledge on our meals!   So, to close, I'm a mom who enjoys good food & sharing it with my kids. You could totally bring (mature!!) children here but at the same time, I'm not cool with putting down $47 for my kids steak dinner...so cost keeps it as a Date Night venue.   Go here."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch on a weekday. It's a beautiful place!! Right in the heart of Oldtown Scottsdale. Our server was extremely nice and accomadting. 5 stars for customer service! We also got to meet the chef and she was so young and intellectual. We checked in on yelp and got the free appetizer as well as the octopus. Seriously the most tender, delicious octopus I have had. I got a grilled shrimp salad and it was good too. All of our food was aethestically pleasing and delicious. We were the only people in the restaurant though. All lunch entrees were from $11-18.  Pros: Beautiful place, delicious food, excellent service  Cons: Empty restaurant"}
{"text":"What a wonderful experience we had last night!  We are visiting from NJ and walked over from the W at the recommendation concierge and are so happy that we did.  The vibe is very cool and the friendly staff is knowledgeable and efficient as drinks are promptly refilled with inventive cocktails, microbrews, or wine.  The menu is creative, fresh, and presented very nicely.  We were most impressed by the friendliness of the waiter Rob, our server and even the manager who took the time to chat with us about the restaurant.  Great spot!!"}
{"text":"Took my wife and mom to this place for Mother's Day brunch and was pleasantly surprised. Great service, great food, great trendy atmosphere. Servers are very attentive. Suffice to say that my wife and mom loved it !"}
{"text":"I was visiting AZ from LA for the weekend and came across this restaurant, and I am so glad I did because the food was delicious, as were the cocktails and wine! Our server/bartender was so cool and the mural pastel of Frida was awesome! Only if this restaurant were also in LA."}
{"text":"The reviews for El Panzon Y Frida have been really great so far, I was super excited to check out this restaurant for a Happy Hour event! The space was a bit smaller than I expected but the decor and architecture seemed well thought out, it was very modern and eclectic!  We had gone for happy hour and in reviewing the menu, it seemed like a good deal with the few food and drink selections to choose from. I initially got the House Gyozas and Spicy Kale Dip appetizers to start. The gyoza were presented beautifully with veggies & garnish atop a citrus soy glaze. All of us agreed that the citrus soy was a little bit too salty, but I unfortunately was not a fan of this dish. I spoke with our server and he was gracious enough to offer to get me something else so I went with the Orange Beef taco bites. Those and the Kale Dip were phenomenal! The Orange Beef taco bites had tasty pieces of orange beef topped with jalapeño, citrus zest, and a light sauce; a little bit of sweet and spicy! All dishes looked amazing but my favorite was the Kale Dip as it had a lot of added color with the crudites (radishes, carrots, and cherry tomatoes). I personally enjoyed the toasted baguette most with the dip, however.  The head chef of the restaurant mentioned how art is their inspiration which was very evident by the attention to detail on the food. They source ingredients from local farmers and seem to work to create a unique experience for patrons. Overall, a great new addition to Old Town Scottsdale, we will be back!"}
{"text":"What an amazing fresh new foodie experience for Scottsdale!! We wanted to get out if our old rut of Sushi Roku and Sumo Maya and try something new...and are so happy we did!! Not only did this charming restaurant impress with its culinary artistry but the decor was whimsical yet trendy, complete w a mural of Frida Kahlo on a wood tiled wall!! The Cornish hen, the carmelized peach salad, lamb philly cheese steak and the bread basket were among our faves....apparently the chef is only 23 years old! Can't wait to see how this restaurant continues to evolve. With a start like this, the sky's the limit!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding period: I entertain customers frequently. From the Sage Margarita, the apps of Grilled Octopus (some of the best I have had), house Gyozas, Orange beef taco bites, the main of Duck and Sea Bass, and the finish of tequila ice cream. Simply outstanding!  Will be back and will tell all that I know this is worth going to..."}
{"text":"What attracted me to this restaurant was the name. As mexican born, el Panzón and Frida talks to my roots. As we entered, the whole decoration got me even more excited, very Mexican looking decoration a big picture of Frida so that I couldn't wait for the next part: \"food\". While I didn't check the menu ahead of time, I was a bit surprise that it didn't have traditional mexican dishes as expected by the name and decor. The food is well presented and the waiter was very helpful. This place is really very expensive for the portions. I didn't feel my money's worth."}
{"text":"Decided to come here after seeing a flyer online for flamenco music and dancing. I expected decent food and some entertainment but I ended up being blown away by both. This is now one of my favorite restaurants in town! The presentation, the thought behind the food, the flavors, everything was a hit! Not to mention the entertainment capturing my attention when my taste buds weren't distracting me. I can't wait to go back! This restaurant truly transported me to another place for my dining experience. Lastly, the service was wonderful as well. Definitely going back next week!"}
{"text":"Best atmosphere. Most delicious  melt in your mouth food. Thee best customer service. This place is a must try!! It has only been open for a few weeks and let me tell you... the food is to die for! It it so unique and truly shows they put every effort in every dish. The ambiance is just right! It's a class place with a kick of that Latino vibe. I will say That from the moment we walked in, everyone was so attentive and truly genuine. It's a perfect place to come on a date a perfect place to come alone after work, a party or any occasion. Try this place out!! You will love it!!! Lawwwdd yes!"}
{"text":"We tried the food family style at the suggestion of the waiter, so I was able to try quite a few things. Nothing really wowed me, but nothing unpalatable. I'd say good, not great. The portions felt small for the price and quality, but it's also Old Town. Service was pretty slow, even with the restaurant being pretty much empty. Iced tea was brewed to order in a single-serve teapot that they give to you at the table.... which would usually be awesome, but it ends up WAY over-steeped because they don't give you a big enough glass (or enough ice) to pour into your glass quickly enough. I might try it again, but probably not anytime soon."}
{"text":"First time here. Came in to celebrate a friends birthday. The food is very good. Our service with Tim was excellent. He checked in on us and made suggestions on the menu. I had the ceviche which sat on a mango puree with a glass of sangria, very gooid. We sat outside. They do have music playing but not too loud. I would definitely suggest trying out this place. Great as a casual date night."}
{"text":"I love love love this new spot in Old Town! We definitely needed this great culinary addition to the Old Town foodie scene. Talk about a tastebud party! All of the colors and flavors in their dishes are off of the charts. From the trendy ambiance to the world class service, and of course delicious cocktails and food- you're sure to have a 5-star experience!  We started with the fried olives, bone marrow, house gyozas {complimentary chef bite for checking in on Yelp!}, AND cheese, pickles, and bits! I think it is safe to say that we were pretty full after all of these incredible starters but of course we had to order more! For my entree, I ordered the scallops and lobster and it was super tasty. It even had black garlic on the side of the dish, so unique! I also LOVED the pickled potatoes. Unfortunately we didn't have room for dessert but that just means that i'll have to come back ASAP.  I will absolutely be back again and will be telling friends and family all about this fabulous culinary experience!"}
{"text":"All the pretty pictures I kept seeing of the food here won me over to check it out. A friend and I decided to do a \"Frida\" day by checking out Frida Kahlo's exhibit at the Heard Museum and then coming here for a late lunch. El Panzon (slang for \"big belly\") Y Frida is a beautiful restaurant in Scottsdale that has an artsy rustic-modern setting. They serve up really pretty inventive Latin inspired dishes. When you first enter, you are immediately drawn to the large mural of Frida on the back driftwood wall. El Panzon Y Frida opens at lunchtime and stays open pretty late for the late night crowd. We ate light and ordered off the small bites and shared plates menu. The House Gyozas are similar to pot stickers and are filled with sweet potato, carrot and beet puree. The Orange Beef Taco Bites were delicious and the Ceviche (sea bass, mango habenero, cucumber and radish) was nice and light. Paulina Martinez is the chef here and she really creates some gorgeous colorful plates. It was happy hour so I ordered their popular Chili Cucumber Capirihna. The drink was pretty amazing and had a nice blend of lime/cucumber with a hint of spiciness. They were nice enough to offer us dessert (a killer chocolate mousse) because my friend wore an outfit inspired by Frida. The service was probably the only part of our experience that could use a tiny bit of improvement. But overall we had a wonderful time. El Panzon Y Frida is a great new addition to the local culinary scene."}
{"text":"Came in for my second visit. Vegetarian day today. I ordered the house gyoza and roasted veg. Then my yelp check-in offered me a free chef inspired small bite. I'm excited to see what it is.  I asked the bartender for something similar to a Mich ultra and he suggested a dark beer. I found that funny. The second bartender stepped in, offered me two samples and I picked one of her suggestions.  Both bartenders actively made small talk with the two people at the bar, so that was nice!   The roasted veg was fantastic! Even the pearl onions, and I'm not an onion fan! Beautiful to look at, and a cut above the more mundane roasted veg I've seen in other venues.  The gyoza was tasty, the sauce nicely acidic, the cabbage in the bowl crisp. The dish wasn't very hot, but I was satisfied with that.  I thought the chef inspired was going to be something of menu, but by complete coincidence it was the gyozai ordered! So rather than get a surprise small bite, I got a cheaper bill. $11 for my veg, my app, and my beer! It would have been $22 without the yelp discount! Go yelp!  The second bartender, a recent relocation from Tucson was charming throughout.  For a fun and tasty small bite, this is a definite good pre bar stop! I'll be moving it up on my oldtown rotation."}
{"text":"How this place isn't the most hopping place for brunch is beyond me. The atmosphere is cool AF, the service is friendly and prompt, the food is superb, and there's a big freaking mural of Frida Kahlo in the main dining area. Somehow I was able to get a table for four immediately upon arrival at noon. If brunch is always this good, though, I don't expect that to be the case after this Mother's Day.  First off, they have bottomless mimosas for $15 a person. I work night shifts, meaning daydrinking is just part of my life, so I was thrilled to have this option. They really do mean bottomless, too. I'm pretty sure I had at least 7 of them throughout brunch, and I didn't even feel judged by the staff for doing so.   Brunch items are surprisingly affordable, with everything being under $15.   Food highlights: -- Order bread for the table if you are especially hungry. It comes with fresh rolls and toast, and they are accompanied by a delicious homemade pesto an an ingenious mixture of butter and whipped chickpeas. I'm definitely stealing that idea for the next time I bake bread at home. -- I ordered the frittata, one friend ordered the eggs benedict, and two people ordered the French toast. Portions were not enormous, but they were certainly generous for the quality of food provided. Nothing was left on anyone's plates, and everyone was satisfied. -- Do yourself a favor and get a side of lamb bacon with whatever you order. Yeah, it's $4 more, which seems kind of steep for a side of bacon, but they make this bacon from the lamb pastrami that they make in house. You'd think that the smoking might take away from the lamb flavor, but that's not the case at all. Bacon texture + smokey lamb flavor = win for your mouth.  Rob was our server, and he was awesome. He was very personable without being overwhelming, and he gave us great insight regarding the food and the restaurant itself. For instance, if you find yourself unusually enchanted by the mural of Frida Kahlo, that might be because it was painted by a protege of Diego Rivera.   Places like El Panzon y Frida make me wish I lived in Phoenix/Scottsdale, because I'd be up here every weekend if I could. The only downside was how loud the neighboring establishments were once I stepped outside, but the blaring club music (because apparently brunch time is a perfectly reasonable time to get lit) was unnoticeable from the inside of the restaurant, so at least while you're dining, you'll be shielded from the noise.  As far as I could tell, El Panzon was the only establishment of its kind in the Old Town Scottsdale area. The upscale dining experience seems like a much-needed addition to the neighborhood. Next time I'm in town, I'd love to experience their dinner. That grilled octopus looks especially enticing. More reason to come back!"}
{"text":"Service was great. It was very slow for a Saturday night so the place was quiet. We loved the decor and the feel of the restaurant, but the food was lacking.  The sirloin sliders came out very cold. Almost like they were straight from the refrigerator - I had to ask my server if they were supposed to be cold. When she very kindly brought us a fresh plate, we could obviously tell that they were microwaved. The bread hardened like a rock making it inedible.  The grilled octopus was great in taste but was extremely cold. I still enjoyed it.  I ordered the seared scallops and coconut lobster. It was so salty, it hurt my tongue! I so badly wanted to eat it but nearly left the plate untouched minus 2 or 3 bites.  I felt like they had so much potential but something huge was lacking in the kitchen."}
{"text":"What a wonderful experience!!!! My wife and I celebrated our 5 year wedding anniversary.  We ordered the grilled peach and goat cheese salad. Which was very tasty and the lamb bacon was superb. We then ordered the grilled octopus and ribeye steak finished on Himalayan salt rock slate.  Customer service was excellent.  Our waitress, Hillary was very nice and accommodating.  She even gave us a complimentary wedding anniversary dessert complete with fireworks as a candle. Which made our day.  Compliments to the chef, to the waitress, and compliments to the whole team for making our anniversary a memorable one."}
{"text":"I recently heard this new restaurant opened in Old Town Scottsdale, so we decided to try it out when one of my coworkers was in town this week.  We were warmly welcomed upon arrival and quickly seated on the patio.  Our server, Rob, was beyond professional and so helpful with his recommendations on the menu.  We shared the sweet potato gyozas and the grilled octopus with tomatoes and pomegranate seeds to start...not a bad introduction to this lovely restaurant as the flavors were great and the presentation was beautiful.  For my entree, I enjoyed the sea bass with pea puree and sauteed vegetables...again, fresh and bursting with flavor.  The decor of the restaurant is lovely, the staff is top notch and the food is fantastic.  My only recommendation is to up the game on the wine selection...not very impressive currently."}
{"text":"Excellent, Love this place!  Great decor, the staff is awesome, and the food...amazing!  We got the fried olives, grilled octopus, gyoza, kale salad, and the lamb bacon pastrami.  Everything was awesome!  The grilled octopus was probably the best I've ever had.  Definitely going to be coming back!"}
{"text":"What a great experience! Sometimes, I'm weary about trying new restaurants. Recently opened restaurants are still working out some kinks and attempting to get all servers and cooks on the same page. However, El Panzón y Frida was just perfect!   A group of five were waited on by Rob. Rob was the best! Very sincere and attentive with all of our requests. He'd come back frequently and our glasses were always filled.   We tried almost everything off of the menu. Make sure to check in so that you're able to get a free small bite. We tried the fried olives, crudités & kale dip, goat cheese mousse, grilled octopus, and house gyozas. All the small bites were delicious! Especially the grilled octopus.   We all did family style on our entrees and ordered the seared sea bass, filet mignon, duck breast, and the 16oz rib eye. I'd highly recommend the rib eye and duck breast! Anything on the menu is definitely worth a try.   The chef, Paulina Martinez, came out so that we could thank her and snap a photo in front of the beautiful Frida painting. What a great experience!"}
{"text":"4.5 stars  Came here for brunch, and was surprised and delighted by the excellent service, interior design, and food.  Drinks: Bottomless mimosas are $15 (or $9/glass) and wine was half off for brunch today.    Food: The brunch menu had about 5 choices. We tried the frittata and the savory bread pudding. Both were delicious and presented beautifully.  Service: Amazing! We were greeted with warm smiles and seated immediately.  Overall, as a new restaurant, I am very impressed with the food, service, and interior design. I would come back and try their dinner menu since the waiter talked up their duck dish."}
{"text":"The food here was delicious. Creative menu, great flavors, excellent presentation. Beat new place i've tried in forever. Atmosphere and service is good enough but the food really impressed me."}
{"text":"Solid restaurant that, if it can make some refinements, could be a solid addition to Scottsdale.  The crowds were light on a Friday night so I hope they can be made sooner rather than later as things can turn over pretty quickly in this part of town.  The menu sort of straddles Regional Mexican, Tapas, and general culinary school exploration.  It is relatively small and could use a more cohesive direction.  While everything ordered was good some of the items seemed incongruent with one another. We went from gyoza, to ceviche, to pastrami on rye which made for a little disorienting meal.  The service was solid and mainly attentive.  It did rub our table mates wrongly, however, when they asked for a side salad and were brought a large and no attempts were made to rectify the check.    All in all, a lot of potential.  With a few tweaks this could draw praise comparable to its namesakes."}
{"text":"We had a 6:30 reservation on Saturday night and they had a happy hour going through 7pm so we quickly ordered the mules, which were yummy and refreshing.  I checked in on yelp so they gave us the house gyoza which is a sweet potato/beet dumpling.  We're not a huge fan of beets in general but the dish was pretty and might be enjoyable for someone who loves beets.  We ordered the grilled octopus and the bone-in ribeye - both delicious and beautifully plated.  Service was also great and they give you a choice of regular water or cucumber-infused water!"}
{"text":"I rarely give up five stars. Staff here has been uniformly awesome. The food has been universally amazing being diverse, skillfully made, and delicious.  Their beverage selection is also rather nice.   Anytime that you're in old town looking for a bite to eat you have to hit here at least once."}
{"text":"It's always delightful to discover there's a new hot spot opened up when we come to town, so we came in to check this one out!  We made a reservation since it was Friday night on Open Table & they called to reconfirm & that we wanted a patio table . Service was top notch as was the food!  We started with a specialty drink, El Panzon Paloma (El Silencio Mexicali, fresh grapefruit & lime purée, basil simple & sea salt foam). Then we shared the House Gyozas (sweet potato, Beet purée & citrus soy); Grilled Octopus, pearl onions & cherry tomatoes with spicy aioli & pomegranate & the Seared Sea Bass:  Pea purée with seasonal veggies (asparagus, green beans, carrots, onions & tomatoes) & a saffron wine sauce !  Give this place a try, you will enjoy it!!"}
{"text":"It was our first time here but the atmosphere is absolutely gorgeous. Very cool decor and nice employees. We just had drinks and a snack, but we enjoyed our first time here."}
{"text":"Went here at lunch time wanting to have their Grilled Octopus and Bone-In Ribeye, not knowing they have brunch menu only. BUT, the chef was able to serve the octopus and ribeye. The place was pretty empty, only 2 other patrons, so we were seated right away.  I liked the decor and feel of the restaurant, casual and relaxed. Since I used Yelp check-in, we got a free chef's bites: House Gyoza (pureed carrot, beet and sweet potato). Good thing that was the only thing I did not like. It was just not for me. On the other hand, other things we ordered were very good and tasty. Excellent service also. Thanks to the chef, we got 16 oz Bone-In Ribeye (grilled over Himalayan salt block, house chimichurri) & Grilled Octopus (pearl onion, cherry tomatoes, spicy aioli & pomegranate), Orange Beef Taco Bites (house tortilla topped with citrus zest, jalapeno, sesame), Sirloin Sliders (pickled cabbage, pearl onion, dijon, horseradish, local pretzel bun), and Amaretto French Toast (lemon curd, seasonal berries, micro mints).  Definite recommendations are the Grilled Octopus and the Bone-In Ribeye. Will be back here again and next time will try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - The Cure - Friday I'm In Love)  I don't care if your cocktails blue Small bites great and Gyoza too Happy Hour I care about you It's Frida I'm in love  Tacos you can fall apart Mac & Cheese Ox Tails take my heart Oh Bo Bites, hasn't even start It's Frida I'm in love   El Panzon Y Frida has been on my food-radar for some time since I missed the Yelp party here and heard so much about it; mainly it was the best ever!  So what the heck where was my invite!?  Just kidding, I didn't make the cut.    Needless to say, I came with a friend on a quiet Friday night.  The place itself was rustic with urban street fare feel.  Happy Hour till 7pm so we jumped on it ordering our drinks and the Orange Beef Taco Bites and House Gyoza.  Both were beautifully plated and the taste to accompany it!  The tacos had a great texture combo; mild crunch from the crusted beef and subtleness of the tortilla.  It was sweet and spicy providing a pop to your palates with every bite!  The house gyoza again was pretty and I felt bad having to eat it; or not!  Served in a bowl of broth and stuffed with beet puree; the gyoza had an aromatic punch with a sweet and smooth texture.  My partner and I shared all night so we shot for the Grilled Octopus and the Ox Tail Mac and Cheese; yeah had to go for that one!  The grilled octopus was probably the best I had in town.  Not too fishy, but also the texture was like butter.  The mac and cheese was creamy from the cheese but had a great meaty kick obviously from the ox tail.    Overall, El Panzon Y Frida definitely delivered for my palates and provided a great vibe.  I didn't care to much from their drink menu, but their food was a hit! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I am SO GLAD I decided to come to El Panzon Y Frida for dinner. Located in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale this place stands out from all the clubs in the area. The décor is cozy and the tables are laid out well in the large space they have.   The drink menu is filled with several different cocktails and their beer taps rotate frequently. I ordered a tomato martini- it sounds weird but it was delicious! They use tomato water to flavor and it is served with fresh mozzarella and basil. I would highly recommend it if you're looking for something refreshing and different.   I can't say enough amazing things about the food here. I really hope this place sticks around because everything we ordered was perfect. The bone marrow appetizer is generously sized and served with asparagus, corn tortilla, and house chimichurri. The savory flavor of the marrow was well complimented by the chimichurri. I also ordered the grilled octopus and I think it might be my favorite octopus dish ever! It was cooked perfectly and charred slightly on the outside giving some additional great taste. The spicy aioli was the perfect choice for some added flavor. I ordered the duck breast for my entrée. The presentation was beautiful! The perfectly cooked duck was plated on sweet potato puree and served with lingonberries and heirloom tomatoes.  The service I had was exceptional. Our server provided great recommendations throughout the course of the meal and made sure we had a great experience. I can't say enough good things about El Panzon Y Frida and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Loved everything about this place...the Frida mural and influenced menu made it extra interesting.  Came in with large party and we tried a lot of things family style.. Octopus was stellar, very tender and was told it was marinated for 24 hours before cooking. Also loved the potstickers, gorgeous presentation and taste.  Fellow diners said the marrow and beef tacos were outstanding.  We tried all three soups and salads!  Wow!  Can't stop thinking about the gazpacho in particular.  Drinks & service fantastic!"}
{"text":"See my review for this great place for the Elite Yelp event at:   https://www.yelp.com/biz/yelp-elite-night-at-el-panzon-y-frida-scottsdale.  The food, drinks, every employee we came in contact with was top notch. Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"I am changing my original review to 5 stars. We received a call and personal email apologizing for our prior experience and we gave the place another go for dinner. We are so happy we did! We started with the octopus as an appetizer, I have to say, probably the best octopus I have had so far in Phoenix, tender and seasoned beautifully. Next we ordered the duck and the filet. The duck was sliced into moist medallions and came with a sweet potato puree, cooked perfectly. I enjoyed my filet the most.  It came sizzling on a hot block of himalayan salt which imparted all the seasoning needed. My only recommendation would be to take the steak off after a couple of minutes, otherwise it would tend to get too salty. Then, Rob brought us a drink that tasted like a expresso martini in a glass with whipped cream. Great way to finish the evening! Joanne told us we would be treated like VIP's and we certainly were, kudos to her, Rob and of course the chef. We will be back and appreciate this restaurant cares about their patrons."}
{"text":"Ah, so disappointed that I can't give this place more than two stars. It's only been open a few months, so maybe still working out the kinks, but still, too many misses.   The Scene But to start with the positive- the place is beautiful. Love the walls, the Frida mural, tall tops in the bar area, and a patio that will be lovely once the weather cools. I can't figure out why there are a million TVs showing sports around the room- they seem very out of place. One over the bar is sufficient if you must. Or maybe change the channel to something artsy? Sadly, the place was dead when we walked in at 6:30 on a Wednesday night. I was only half joking when I asked the waitress who greeted us if the place was open. We were the only 2 customers until another couple showed up about 30 minutes later.   Drinks This is not the place to come for cocktails. My husband tried the bourbon drink on the menu and it was drinkable, but not well balanced. The staff was experimenting with things that didn't look, sound, or taste very good to me. None of the house cocktails appealed, so I stuck to wine.  Bites They just added food to their HH menu (though not shown on their website yet). We tried a few as well as some items on the regular menu. - Spicy kale dip- the presentation was great with pretty slices of watermelon radish and colorful carrots. Unfortunately, the carrots were a bit dry- like they had been prepped hours before. Cherry tomatoes were sliced in half and not very good for dipping. The baguette was too crunchy for my taste- more like a big crouton. The dip itself was fine. Glad we tried, but not something I'd order again. - House gyozas- dry wonton wrappers with a sweet purple filling in a broth that tasted like soy+teriyaki. It was pretty on the plate, but didn't love the taste.  - Goat cheese mousse- a smaller HH size version of their full plate (no pickled veg with this one). Fine, but more like a dessert cheese course with a sweet, strawberry tasting cup of preserves, nuts, and fresh berries. Also a few more slices of the crouton crispy baguette.  - Grilled peach and goat cheese salad- this was good with peaches that were sweet and grilled just enough so they kept their firmness. Too much dressing for me, would ask for it on the side next time. - Grilled octopus- our server said this is what they are known for, and it's clear why. It was really good. Tender and flavorful- a few small tentacles as well as a small pile of sliced pieces. The aioli on the plate was flavorful. The pomegranate seeds seemed like an odd flavor pairing but they were pretty on the plate.  This place knocks it out of the park when it comes to presentation. Food had some real winners (octopus!) that give me hope, but the sub-par drinks and overall awkwardness of being the only patrons in a big restaurant don't make me want to return anytime soon. Sorry."}
{"text":"This place is by far the best food establishment in Arizona. I came here for a drink a few weeks ago and have been dying to come back! The happy hour is amazing (3-8p), the service is exceptional, and the food is amazing. We got octopus which was the best grilled octopus I've had. Extremely tender. We also had the kale dip which was a bit spicy but amazing! I am SO thrilled I came back and I hope the best for the establishment."}
{"text":"Outstanding restaurants. Loved food presentation . Server was very attentive . Great ambience . Worth the drive ."}
{"text":"So , I went there early to meet with my girlfriends , I was actually super early and decided to seat at the bar , the 2 bartenders were super nice and offer water ( 2 kinds of water. Once the rest of the party got to the restaurant we decided to order right away the server was super nice and did an excellent Job ! We drove her crazy with split checks but she handle it super good ( 11 of us ) . The only reason why I am giving 4 stars is because the food took forever, and the portions are super small for the price. But besides from that the Flamenco was awesome !!! Thank you for having us."}
{"text":"This place is pretty incredible - very unique experience. The drinks are amazing (recommend the lingonberry mule) and the food was delicious (tried the octopus - do it)! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"El Panzon y Frida is certainly an interesting addition to the Old Town restaurant scene. Just perusing through the photos on Yelp is a feast for the eyes! The food was as good as it looked too.   From the name of the place I assumed it was going to be a Mexican eatery inspired by recipes from Frida Khalo. If you've ever read the book \"Frida's Fiestas\" you'll know what I'm talking about. It turns out El Panzon y Frida is more of a fusion of global flavors. They do pay homage to Frida with a gorgeous mural on one of the the interior walls.   I dined with two friends and we started out with a few dishes to share, plus we redeemed the Yelp check-in offer, vegetarian Gyozas. We shared the fried olives, bone marrow and the cheese plate. It was plenty of food to start with! The fried olives were really good- stuffed with goat cheese. I've only eaten bone marrow a handful of times. A couple of bites was plenty for me! The cheese plate was packed with all kinds of goodies- cheese, nuts, dried fruit, fresh fruit, and pickled veggies. The gyoza chef bite was tasty, although the dough seemed slightly undercooked. But it's probably the most creative check-in offer I've seen!  For my entree, I ordered the seared sea bass with pea puree and seasonal vegetables. This was the perfect dish for the summer heat! It's super light and fresh. The fish was perfectly cooked. The pea puree was really good...perhaps slightly under seasoned. But overall the dish was beautifully done. I would order this again for a light dinner.   We had a super leisurely dinner and the service was excellent. The wine is interesting but a touch limited. Loved the Tucson presence on the beer list!"}
{"text":"Wow, the octopus is so tender with a wonderful flavor.  I will make sure to have the octopus as my appetizer each time.  However, selecting the main course on future visits will not be as easy since each of the description entice me to try another one.  The service is great.  I will definitely come back.    Thank you for the great experience."}
{"text":"I am a Frida fanatic and my love for her goes wayyyy back before she became a trend. I found out that a restaurant had opened in her honor and well, I had to judge, I mean, check the place out. No intention on dinner just a drink or two and maybe an appetizer...  El Panzón Y Frida occupies a pretty large corner spot in Old Town Scottsdale and definitely stands out. The open concept architecture is welcoming and the interior is modern, yet traditional Mexico touches are in place such as the pressed tin and rich woods. The bar is the center focal point but the floor to ceiling mural of Frida is eye catching.  Diego's daughter had written a cookbook comprised of her mother and Frida's recipes but I did not ask if any of these were used for this menu. Regardless, the food here is delicious!  Some of the signature cocktails are named in reference to the lovebirds life such as The Lincolnberry Mule and el Panzón's Paloma. I liked that incorporated touch. We ordered the Cucumber Chili Caipirinha ( two ea. to be exact ) so refreshing with a spicy kick at the end. Love it!  There is a Yelp check in offer that my love found which gives you a complimentary appetizer/small bite plate but we had already ordered the whipped goat cheese and fresh berries plate ( said offer) so, Our waiter offered us the gyozas to honor the check in offer. Super cool of him! The gyozas had a beet, sweet potato and carrot purée with a homemade dipping sauce! Hubby practically licked the bowl clean! Our favorite was the Chilean sea bass ceviche- so delicious!  Although we only stopped in to \"check things out\"  we ended up staying a few hours talking, meeting the staff and chef and just enjoying the space.  A beautiful experience, at a beautiful restaurant with beautiful people. We look forward to returning!  A five star \" Viva La Vida y Pazón y Frida!\" Review!"}
{"text":"Food is dank, drinks are dark, atmosphere is dank, wait staff is dank, location is dank, but bring money!"}
{"text":"I went here last night and his place was sooo good! It is one of the best places I have been to. It's pretty new so there wasn't many people but it's a shame because this place is great more people really need to come and try it!  We ordered the fried olives and I decided to try them even though I hate olives and to my surprise I actually really liked them! We ordered a lot of other tapas. Usually octopus is rubbery, this one was so soft. When I get bone marrow at other places they usually give you barely any or it's really hard to get out, here there is so much and you just scoop it out. All in all the plating is beautiful, the flavors are fun and unique, the ambiance and decorations are really nice and the servers were all sweet!"}
{"text":"Absolutely AMAZING dinner!  Everything is tasty and done beautifully by the chef!  Highly recommend the octopus, rib eye and Tim, our waiter!"}
{"text":"First, let me say that this restaurant is visually awesome!  We met friends to celebrate three birthdays and an anniversary, and wanted to try something new.  As a newer venue, this restaurant has a lot going for it, but still needs a little refinement to earn 5 stars.    Positives: super great service by Tim! Visually amazing and creative menu! Beautiful food.  Needs work: bigger tables, more comfortable chairs, faster kitchen, noise control   We were a little surprised that we were the only people in the restaurant at 6:30 on a Friday night (perhaps the lack of a happy hour menu??)..  Eventually things started filling up later in the evening, and that definitely made conversation a little challenging.  We were okay with a slower pace, because we wanted to linger over dinner and catch up with friends!   The seats are small and metal - definitely a challenge since there wasn't a petite person in our party!  The tables are all small, which was a real problem when you have a lot of plates. If you are going for a tapas experience, its just awkward.  For example, we ordered the Cheese, Pickles & Bits (really fabulous display!!) and the break basket (amazing chickpea butter and pesto!).  The tall basket was in front of me, and there was no way for me to reach over it to get to the other plates (unless I stood up or asked someone to pass it to me).  It was just really awkward.  And we were constantly moving our plates, drinks and silverware to try to make room for the next dish.   The Lingonberry Mules were fabulous - a creative twist.  I also appreciated the cucumber water - refreshing in this summer heat! The kale side salads were crisp and hearty.  Two of us ordered the duck breast - what a beautiful presentation!  Served with a smoke-filled glass bell cover, the duck was moist and tender served on a bed of sweet potato and carrots. My husband tried the fish cakes, which were good, but he recommended these as a shared item.  We were all jealous of the friend who ordered the Bone-in Ribeye, served sizzling on a salt brick!  Wow - did that smell and look fabulous!    Tip: check in via Yelp, for a yummy small bite treat!   We also tried a couple of the desserts - chocolate mousse and the popcorn ice cream! Creative and tasty. AND since we were celebrating, lets just say they make it special!  It is clear that the chef really cares about quality, creativity and presentation.    Overall, we were delighted with many aspects of the restaurant - we will be happy to introduce others to this venue.  It's pricey - which I don't mind when having a celebratory dinner with friends.  However, please consider a happy hour tapas menu to lure me back on a regular basis.  And for goodness sakes, get some real chairs and bigger tables!!!"}
{"text":"Frida fan here. I was looking for an excuse to come here and I found it with the SheForks Happier Happy Hour. Also wanted to see Mer because she is the coolest. This is a great spot with neat architectural aspects that initially seem like they would clash but they seamlessly work together. Even the bathroom is rad with its geometric and kaleidoscopic tiles. The outside is definitely deceiving as it comes off as nondescript and simple in design; always a reminder for me to not judge a book by its cover.  They have a lot of drinks on their happy hour menu but I stuck to water and ordered two appetizers: the house gyozas and the goat cheese mousse (vegan and vegetarian respectively). The gyozas were a colorful sight in a bowl with veggies and a citrus soy glaze (too salty) and filled with a beet, carrot and sweet potato puree. I enjoyed them, they were light enough but somehow filling. My goat cheese came out on a board with various berries, grapes, nuts and a strawberry compote that had red wine in it. I forgot I read that part in the menu and silly me thought it would burned off when it got \"cooked\". Anyways, I thought the smell of alcohol was strong around me and I remembered it was the compote and I stopped eating it. Everything else on the board was yummy though.  I liked that we got to meet the head chef and interim manager. They seemed to take pride in their work and righteously so. I do hope this place continues to be successful, which can be tough with all the restaurant competition in Old Town. Salud!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch before a matinee at Fashion Square.  From the get-go, superb, friendly service.  Enjoyed the ambiance, fresh, modern decor, and coziness.  And the lunch and bevie menu had us salivating.  We had the Paloma with smoky mescal (yyyuuumm) and the rye crafted cocktail with lemon, paired with the ginger salmon and lamb pastrami.  A must return soon to try another menu item."}
{"text":"My husband and I are here for a conference and stumbled upon this gem for Saturday brunch. It's really beautiful inside but the food. is. amazing. We had the grilled peach and goat cheese salad, grilled octopus, smoked lamb pastrami on rye, and the sirloin sliders. Everything was delicious! Our favorite would have to be the grilled octopus. It's super soft and tender and tomatoes and onions were grilled to perfection. I'm still thinking about it. Our server was Tim; he is kind and was super accommodating. We really wanted the octopus but it wasn't on the menu. He helped make it happen! He made great recommendations and was very attentive and nice. Two thumbs up for El Panzon Y Frida!"}
{"text":"Husband and I came here for Sunday brunch a few weeks back.  We were the only patrons in the place, except for one guy that was sitting at the bar.  The decor and layout are very colorful and fresh.  The food and drinks are creative and delicious.  The bartender was our server/runner since we were two of the three customers present. Given that, I assumed the service would be very attentive, with drink orders delivered sooner rather than later, empty plates removed promptly, drink refills offered quickly, etc., but that was not the case, so I have docked one star."}
{"text":"Had an amazing dinner!  Chef Paulina Martinez has done amazing in creating beautiful and delicious food.  Atmosphere is casual, cozy and inviting and the dining experience exceptional!"}
{"text":"Waiter was kind and very positive. Drinks were mediocre.  Food was even worse. Their signature dish was a grilled octopus.  It tasted like a bland chicken. The Cornish hen was so salty and resembled chick fil a nuggets. The pastrami sandwich was indescribable. And the sea bass ceviche was what? Not a ceviche at all.  The decor is more suitable for Glendale than Scottsdale bar scene.  I predict three months and the locks will be on the doors."}
{"text":"In town from Chicago visiting my son at ASU and we stumbled here on a quiet Tuesday night.  Our best meal in AZ.  We tried the smoked lamb pastrami, ceviche, octopus, tacos, hanger steak, and soup. Every dish was excellent and the service was in point. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This place is such a hidden gem!!! I was just thinking tonight that I don't have a staple restaurant that I just love in Old Town- well that changed tonight! The decor is modern and interesting, and they have ample TVs (no sports bar feel) that will keep the men entertained. The staff is so nice and very timely!  Hillary at the bar is who you want taking care of you! They have extended happy hour for the summer, Tues-Sun until 8pm! Can't beat that.. $6 cocktails- lingonberry Mule (my favorite) and the cucumber chili caipirinha (unique and tasty but would pick the Mule), $6 Chardonnay and red blend, $5 craft beers. Also tried the house gyoza, which is filled with sweet potato, carrot and beer purée with a citrus soy for $10. Absolutely to die for! I got them with sauce on the side and would make that choice again so they're not overly salted. Every dish that came out and every drink poured looked amazing. Excited to make my way back here again soon!"}
{"text":"Ambiance: I have very mixed feelings in this regard. It is very trendy and modern but with a warm appeal to it. There are several large screen TV's for games, but it isn't quite like a sports bar.  Service: It was only about 40% occupancy when we were dining on a Friday night for Arizona Restaurant Week. Despite ordering off a set menu and not being really busy, it felt like everything took a long time. From sitting down around 7:40pm to ordering, we didn't get our wine and beer till past 8pm. We often felt a long lull in between our dishes. We did however, get a lot of attention from the water boy. Our water glasses were always full. Our server is very friendly, no complaints there. Food: For a $44 set menu on ARW, I expected more. We were looking forward to the grilled clams, but they were out. I was quite agitated with this running our seeing that ARW just started, we didn't dine very late, it wasn't busy and the grilled clams are a feature item on the ARW menu. We ended up getting the salad and crab dip, which was good, but not memorable. For entrees, I got the king salmon, which was on the ok/good rating, but thetatoes and vegetables were quite flavorful. The lamb pastrami sandwich sounds more fancy than it actually tastes. The desserts were served on black slates. What bothered me about the desserts were that they could have been a bit more cold. The whipped burrata was a bit warmer than room temperature. Perhaps the slate came right out of the dishwasher? It would have been better off the slate was chilled first. The chocolate coffee cake was cafeteria quality, not memorable."}
{"text":"This is going to be a long review, because the situation is complicated, and El Panzon y Frida is worth saving.  Let me start by saying that Panzon (the full name is too long to keep typing) opened just three months ago, and has some amazing strengths.  You want it to be the #1 restaurant in Phoenix, and I think it can be.    But it isn't.  Hopefully this review will point out some of the symptoms of the problem.  The root I can only guess at, but it feels like management neglect.  Let me tell you what I mean.  Consider the ambiance: when you enter, your first impression is that you really want to eat here.  It is open, clean, bright, and very artfully decorated -- literally.  There is a fine mural of Frida Kahlo (artist and wife of the Mexican muralist Diego Rivera - El Panzon), and a couple of wood sculptures.  It is one of the best restaurant spaces in Phoenix.   But then you notice that the details have been neglected or flat out done wrong.  The tables are small; if you are a party of four you might well get a hightop that is barely big enough for two, especially for a small plate restaurant where people may have more than one item at a time on the table.  The chairs are metallic monstrosities that are not comfortable.  The construction celebrates noise; I know this is the fashion today, but you can overdo it and Panzon is too noisy.  When we were there the restaurant was almost empty except for our party of 4 and a couple of people at the bar -- AND one table with 12 boisterous party goers.  We were seated as far from them as possible but it was still a problem.  If Panzon had all seats filled (100?), it would have been unbearably loud.  Now on to the really big issues.  It was Tuesday night, and Panzon was nearly empty except for the large group.  They get very little business on Tuesday, the waiter said, and there was just a small kitchen staff (one?).  But we didn't know that when we came, and nobody told us that service would be terribly slow (30 minutes to get our first course), a major food item would be sold out (the cornish hen), or that the bartender would have to double as our waiter.  In summation, we were short changed because Panzon cut corners far beyond the bone on staffing and inventory.  Had the large group not shown up, Panzon would have been empty, cavernous, and a bit sad.  Restaurants need customers, not only to stay in business, but to provide a convivial dining experience.  But it is the old chicken and the egg riddle - you won't have the customers if you don't provide the product, and you can't afford to make the product right if you don't have the customers.  If Panzon can't solve this, they will stay open just as long as the owner feels like writing checks. And that would be a shame.  Where Panzon is strong, it is very, very strong.  Take the menu.  There are about 20 small plates and five modest sized entrees.  The small plates are large; two items per person is more than enough for most mortals.  The menu is creative with such dishes as lamb pastrami, ,fried olives, sirloin sliders served with pickled cabbage, and even oddities such as bone marrow and worm encrusted fish cakes.  Even standard dishes such as the grilled peach and goat cheese salad are done with a twist - in this case with cherries, lamb bacon, candied pecans and a ginger vinaigrette.  Hurray for Panzon!  I think the recipes are also top-notch, because in most cases, we found the flavor profiles to be nothing short of remarkable.  Whenever we got a dish that was properly executed, we were floored.  Unfortunately, not every dish was properly executed.  The seared sea bass, listed as an entree for $28, was a fairly small piece but looked yummy.  The outside had a golden sear and the presentation was artful.  Unfortunately, the \"chef's\" genius had enabled him to do the impossible - dry out the outside and leave the inside raw.  And the accompanying vegetables were cold and indifferently cooked.    Another miss was almost comical because there were so many errors.  We had ordered a soup (feijoada - it was excellent) and the peach and goal cheese salad.  We asked that the soup be brought first, then the salad, then the other items we ordered.  We asked for the dressing on the side.  Over thirty minutes later we got the soup as requested; thirty SECONDS later we got the salad.  The dressing was mixed in.  There was no lamb bacon in it.  The dressing had far too much balsamic.  Our other dishes were more than fine, and I want to come back to see if they can do better, but I don't think I will.  The understaffing, lack of an adequate supply of ingredients, amateurish service (very friendly but often inattentive), uncomfortable seating, and utterly missing quality control are overwhelming problems, fixable only by committed and hard-working management.  Does Panzon have that?  If that can be found, Scottsdale could have a \"five diamond\" candidate.  In the meantime, you should try it, and be sure to write a review."}
{"text":"Great ambiance and music vibes. Service was superb. Food presentation at its finest!!! Can't wait to come back for happy hour."}
{"text":"Amazing spot. Not crazy about the name, as I can't seem to remember it!  Food was stellar!  Food was seriously beautifully crafted and tasted incredible.  We went for a friends birthday and had a wonderful time.  I hope it gets busier, as I want it to stick around, as it is wonderful! Maybe the location is weird as its in the middle of the the party scene.  I am from Los Angeles and this is up there with the incredible places there!"}
{"text":",,I came back to Phoenix to visit and El Panzon y Frida was close to the hotel so I decided to check it out. Modern romantic vibe but the DJ was playing old school hip-hop and pop. The food was amazing. The duck breast is a must! The flavor pairing were perfect.  The dessert taco wasn't the best. Candied tomatoes were different. The mousse was delicious. Very decadent."}
{"text":"As promised, we returned to try more of the outstanding food at this trendy restaurant. Also to see if the service would live up the quality of the kitchen. Have to say we were really impressed. Rare to have so many perfect bites at one sitting, and the service was stellar, friendly but professional. I think we will make it a point to come back soon and bring our friends. Have to add that the music is diverse and not too loud."}
{"text":"This place needs restaurant impossible to come in or something. The service was incredibly poor. So many people were unhappy and asking where the drinks/food they had ordered were and the place wasn't even that busy. I had to get up and go to the bar because we were ready to order but no one had come to our table yet. When I went to the bar two employees ignored me and walked away. We were never checked on by our waitress when we received our food. I asked for no dairy but of course it came on my dish anyway. My husband got the ribeye which was way better than my duck. The waitress should've mentioned it was just the steak with no side and suggested a side. Breadcrumbs in the chimichurri sauce is odd too. We had to flag someone down to get our bill. This place is so disorganized."}
{"text":"Great staff and good food. Not a fan of worm infused fish cakes, but everything else was awesome!"}
{"text":"This is a wonderful find in the Scottsdale party district.  The food was exceptional and very well priced.  The chef has a menu with fresh and exciting tastes.  She clearly understands flavors and textures.  Don't miss the octopus!!  The service was above and beyond friendly and accommodating.  We will be back on our next night out in downtown Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Read  review of this place in the morning paper and immediately called for dinner reservations. The review had described unusual and tasty food and we were not disappointed. On entering near the noisy bar I had some trepidation but except for the pervasive noise level that, though intrusive, did allow for limited conversation, the dining experience was nothing sort of exquisite. From the tempting list of appetizers I chose the avocado gazpacho which I'd never heard of before and had a marvelous introduction. Next was a small plate of octopus grilled to perfection and served with a satisfying salad. I've only recently become an octopus fan and now can't get enough - as long as it's prepared properly - and this was an expert rendition. The other members of our party of four ordered other deliciously tempting items and all were quite pleased. I can't wait to go back to sample the rest of the menu. The service was mature, caring and friendly while being respectful. Other than the noise my only other complaint was the chairs which are hard metal and desperately in need of cushions."}
{"text":"The food is just beyond delicious, a true feast for the palate!  The way the chef infuses fruits, herbs and spices in drinks and food is masterful and the result:  delicious!  Appetizers, salads, main dishes, desserts. . . ALL amazing;  the service is also superb.  Loved it and highly recommend it to people who like to eat well."}
{"text":"I've been to this place a few times in the past. Definitely has some interesting food. Some of my favorite are the grilled shrimp and the ribeye steak that is prepared on a salt block. Conveniently located in Old Town Scottsdale. Staff is friendly and attentive the decor is modern and eclectic. Definitely looks great compared to the previous restaurant. definitely worth checking out if you're in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Food Presentation was above great, service was ok, the taste of food was not good.  There were few people there.  It was restaurant week which we didn't know.  I had been looking forward to going there.  We didn't not order from the restaurant week menu.  We ordered gyoza which looked amazing but was every gummy. The steak on the salt block which had great presentation.  Most of my go to steakhouses knocked this out of the water as far as cut of meat and flavor.   The inside decoration is beautiful. I was really expecting to love this place.   If they can make great tasting food; I'm in!   2.5 stars for now.... I'll wait for more reviews to come in and see if we will give it a try again."}
{"text":"Besides the beautiful restaurant interior which house the most stunning mural of Frida located in the main dining area, I'm super excited about Executive Chef Paulina's vision of Latin flavors. I recently visited this new restaurant in Old Town Scottsdale with a friend of mine for dinner a few weeks ago. I have heard great things about this new establishment, and some of the photos of the dishes I have seen were stunning. I'm happy to report all the dishes from here were very flavorful and inventive. Let's talk about the food now. Grilled peach & Goat Cheese Salad: the sweetness from the grilled peach paired extremely well with the creamy goat cheese. It was light and has a very summer feel to it. I loved it. The Grilled Octopus was beautifully presented, and delicious to eat. My favorite so far has to be the Fried Cornish Hen were fried to perfection. The meat was oh so tender, and seasoned just right. All of the pieces were stacked on top of pickled fingerling potatoes, which were sitting on a bead of vibrantly green aji verde purée. This aji verde purée took this dish to a whole new level. I'm from Philly, and I know about fried everything, but I'm sure all the Philly peeps would go crazy in love if they had their hands on this delicious aji verde for their fried chicken. Well done Chef Paulina. The Bone-in Ribeye on Himalayan Salt Block came with house  chimichurri was delicious, but both my friend and I thought it to be a little bit too salty and the quality of the meat wasn't up to the price range. Lastly, Chef Paulina recommended a dessert for us, and for the life of me, I can't remember the name. It had ice cream made in house, pieces of cornbread, edible flowers, cherry tomatoes, microgreens, and a thin layer of crispy waffle-like cookie at the bottom of this dessert. I know it's not cool to not have the name of the dish, but I was hoping the menu would have it, but it didn't. Sorry. Overall, I'm very impress with he food and the staff here.  This restaurant is a great addition the Old Town Scottsdale dining scenes. Congratulations peeps!!"}
{"text":"This was my second time here in a week! The food is really good. Its definitely a place to go for a culinary treat. Their drinks are also pretty crafty and they have a great happy hour! Robbi/Robin was our waiter and he was sooo attentive but not annoyingly so at all."}
