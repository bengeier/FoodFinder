{"text":"Look,
If you had one shot, one opportunity to eat everything you've ever wanted, would you savor it or just let it slip? Yo.
His fork is ready, noodles in the pot are heavy, there's sauce on his sweater already PAULS SPAGHETTI he's hungry but on the surface he looks calm and ready to chow down
But the waiter keeps on forgetting what he wrote down the whole restaurant goes so loud he opens his mouth but the order won't come out he's choking now, the chefs joking now. Clocks run out, times now over NO TIP BLAOH!"}
{"text":"We have driven by it countless times and never went in.  We finally stopped in tonight and it was well worth it.  The service was attentive and the food came quickly.  The spaghetti with meat sauce had lots of meet and a little zip.  The veal parmigiana had plenty of cheese with great sides of spaghetti in tomato sauce and amazing roasted vegetables.
Make a reservation as it's quite small and it was very busy.  In the summer they have a big patio."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, good service, everyone is really friendly here. I had the bowtie pasta with shrimp, it was very good, not too filling, but was a little too garlicky. We ordered a slice of the chocolate and the vanilla cake afterwards, both of them were just the right amount of sweet, they weren't too bland, nor too sickly sweet. I had a salad with their house dressing and it was amazing. I would try this place again."}
{"text":"Nice quiet little hidaway smack in the middle of a residential nieghbourhood. Small menu but the kitchen does a nice job. The food is all homemade & authentic Italian. Great place to take that special someone or for treating Mom to dinner."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Pretty good service.  Once when we went here for dinner we had to wait quite long for our main courses to arrive, other then that, I highly recommend this restaurant.

Everything is pretty much homemade...you can certainly tell from the taste.  My SO has had the Spaghetti w/Meatsauce which is(was) his favourite...it no longer appears on the menu(the last time we were there), but they now only offer Spaghetti w/Meatballs...which is also very good.
I've tried the gnocchi once and it was good but my favourite dish is the Rigatone w/Spinach (vegetarian), it is served with a creamy pesto sauce, onions(not a lot), spinach, goat's cheese crumbled on top and toasted pine nuts.  The first time I tried this, I thought I had died and gone to heaven--seriously!!  It is very rich and creamy, which I like and I love pasta.

I also recommend the house salad with a homemande vinagrette dressing to start, and they also bring you fresh baked warm bread w/butter.

Most (if not all) of the desserts are homemade...some on the premises and some offsite...I overheard the server talking to another table.

The patio is great in the summer.  The restaurant itself is quite small but a cozy, relaxing atmosphere.  I don't recommend bringing children here though...
We've been about a dozen times and will definitley keep going back."}
{"text":"Have been here a few times. Very nice staff but however the food lacks that real Italian authencity and because of this I view the dining experience the same as would if I was eating somewhere like Il Fornello. 

Menu is also overpriced considering the pedestrian tasting food that is served"}
{"text":"Italian soul food in a cozy and warm atmosphere.   The service was great too. Our waitress had been eating there since she was 9.   Our pastas, meats, and seafood were all excellent.  The tiger shrimp were large on top of an already very generous portion of pasta.   The meat sauce has a Sunday Gravy (it's an Italian thing and has nothing to do with gravy) thing going on.    The pesto was very fresh and flavorful.   I'll happily relax here with a glass of wine any time.  Thank you for a wonderful night full of food that made me smile."}
{"text":"Frequented Paul's for a number of years and the food is still a delight to have, albeit some of the sauces could use some tweaking (i.e.: Caesar Salad dressing is homemade, but way too strong and heavy).

My biggest gripe about the establishment is the service. Each of the servers seem to be very passive and almost pessimistic about your presence. During service I got the sense that I was a burden to be serving, particularly while I stared at my empty glass of water for over 40 minutes. Further to my point, other people came in to dine and only when the servers personally knew the diners did the service team show any life or energy.

Service is perhaps the biggest component of restaurants these days and frankly I was in a rush just to get away from the dismal attitude that was being sent my way. I'd also like to note that when the bill was brought to the table, the server dropped it on the table and walked away without any eye contact or a \"thank you\". Common courtesy to be thanking your customers at the end of the meal so as to increase your potential for tip, but apparently this staff has lost touch with the fact that they're serving customers that aren't their friends as well."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about Paul's Spaghetti.  The ambiance, the staff, the food and last but not least the price are fantastic."}
{"text":"I've lived in East York for many years yet I'd never heard about this restaurant. Came here for a birthday dinner with a group of 10. To say I was surprised is an understatement! I can't believe it's been here for so long, and I had never heard about it. The food is outstanding! Simple, homemade tasting Italian. Nothing fancy, just great food.

We were a large group with a lot of picky eaters so there was a chance to see and taste many of the dishes. All of them were great. The pastas and steaks were delicious. Even the Caesar salads (which can be pretty humdrum) and fresh bread were awesome. The portions are generous and the prices reasonable. Really, I can't say enough.

There's no shortage of good Italian restaurants in this city and this one is at the top of my list!"}
{"text":"Tried to go there yesterday which was a Wednesday.  The website and voicemail state that they are open on Wednesdays after 5pm but when we went, they were not open.  The sign on the door said they were open on Wednesdays as well.  I had even called on Tuesday to make a reservation and their voicemail recorded said they are closed Tuesdays but if you want to make a reservation, leave a message with the date, time, name and phone number which I did.  The restaurant did not bother to call me back to say they weren't going to be open despite what they website, sign on the door and voicemail stated. That's just unacceptable when you're planning to go their with out of town family. We noticed that the outside of the building doesn't look very inviting so I'm not surprised their customer service is horrible."}
{"text":"What a gem! I've been getting food from this place for a while, and cannot recommend it enough. Everything on the menu is simply delicious. All around really great Italian food, top notch quality you would expect to find in a hotspot in Manhattan, and one that rivals any restaurant in little Italy both in New York and Toronto."}
{"text":"The thing I most appreciate about real Italian food is the way they do veggies. 
Nothing like we do in Canada --a third of the plate meat, one third potato, and one-third limp veggies. 
In Italian places, veggies are at the center of the plate, as in the sauce smothering the pasta.

At Paul's, they may as well list the veggies under dessert.

We went there with my mother-in-law , who has a hard time eating a full meal. My wife and I had gorged last night, so we wanted to eat lightly too. So we ordered four appetizers for the table.

Two orders of Caprese salad, tomato and buffalo mozzarello cheese. Where do they find tomatoes this fresh! 

Grilled calamari, and I don't mean little bits of calamari but entire strips, served with a warm relish. We had to order seconds of bread to wipe it all up!

Rapini with thin slices of parmigiano and pine nuts all over-- who can believe greens as the piece de resistance!!

Enjoy this with a glass of wine, and three people can eat gourmet for about $50.

Find someone who's just been ordered by the doc to cut back on meat and eat way more veggies, and feels like that kind of medicine is worse than a death sentence, and bring them here. It will change their life!!"}
{"text":"One of the best Italian restaurant I've had so for in that price range.
Service is nice and food tastes like Italy. The pasta is cooked properly and the sauces are tasty. The plates are big enough to please person with big appetite! Go there and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Just ate at this restaurant and I was pleasantly surprised! We had the meatballs, farfelle shrimp, and the mussels and they were fantastic! The service was awesome and the patio was awesome, I just wish that the tables and chairs were different, changing them would add to the experience. Overall it was an amazing dinner and I will definitely return. Thanks Paul's spaghetti!"}
{"text":"The delicious, home-cooked style Italian I've been after for years.
* 4.5 stars

Like everyone else has written before me, it's good, simple, home-style Italian food. Honestly, I never thought I'd write the words, \"go and try the spaghetti and meatballs\", but here I am and there you should go.

It's a small place with a small menu and the staff know you on a return visit. That's a trifecta of excellence if you ask me. To the latter point, when we were originally told that our wait would be 30 minutes, we happily said that we'd come back as we live in the neighbourhood. We walked for about 15 seconds when Paul actually chased us down to let us know that a table just became free.

Amazing!"}
{"text":"If you enjoy an excellent traditional Italian cooking, you'll love this place.  It's a family run business with a whole lotta heart.  The cooking is honest, simple and delicious.  I generally avoid pasta at restaurants because it's usually boring. But here, even the humble spaghetti is noteworthy.  Salads have just the right amount of vinaigrette. Bread is the best bread ever!  Desserts are homemade, delicious and generously portioned.  Everything about the place is humble, honest, caring and inviting. Great atmosphere for a quiet, romantic dinner."}
{"text":"Paul's Spaghetti is a small italian restaurant nestled in tiny retail strip in what is otherwise a residential neighbourhood.  I'd been in the area several times without stumbling across it, but someone recommended it to us, and we've been three times since.

Their menu is simple, pleasant, italian food. You can probably guess half of their menu without even having been.   It's well-prepared, tasty, and not terribly expensive, although I wouldn't call it inexpensive either.  About what you'd expect for a sit-down meal in a nice italian restaurant.

It's a small place, and although there aren't tons of tables, when it fills up it can be noisy.  The restaurant has an intimate feel.  Service is friendly, although it's not a rushed atmosphere, so plan to be there for a while.  I've never tried to rush the service, so they may be able to push you through quickly if you wanted to.

If I lived closer, this might be a regular dinner spot, but I have several other italian choices that are closer.  Even then, I've been several times and I'm sure we'll go again."}
{"text":"Food is really good.  Never had anything I didn't like from the pasta dishes to the seafood. Mains come with a side house salad, if you want a side caesar salad instead (yummy), it's an extra $3...I think that's too much. My 2 faves are the penne a la vodka and the shrimp farfalle (so deliciously garlicky).  Their spaghetti and meatballs and lasagna are fantastic too.
I can agree that the service can be slow at times, but I've been there when it's good too. Family run, and they're very nice people.  It's usually a very busy place, so call before you go.  Great patio in the warmer months."}
{"text":"good find.  The portion size was good. 
Shrimp fardalle was good with real tiger shrimps.  Just a bit salty though.  Bf had spaghetti.
Calamari was fresh.  Overall good meal"}
{"text":"At a place like Paul's Spaghetti, it's quite obviously what this place is all about. It's in the same lines as noting WaYnE's Dead Sexy(w/ Austin Powers accent). Pretty OBVIOUS! 

Service was PRETTY good and that same description could be used for the cute young waitress serving us this night. I'm sure if my Friend Ktown was here he would agree because our whole table agreed. LS Princess just couldn't stop smiling as she ordered from her. ;D 

The atmosphere here is Romantic Rustic Italian with a touch of Christmas while playing Unchained Melody's(Ghost Soundtrack) and such. I had an entertaining time enjoying my Friend's playing the Wedding Bells for me like an orchestra... 

Ding, Dong, Ding(Knife hits plate while cutting), Dong(Knocks Fork off plate), Ding(Drops Knife on plate), Dong! They sure know how to make a Man feel extraordinarily cultured as I eat like the Gentleman that I am. :P 

Grilled Calamari(Tender Calamari char-grilled served with Tomato, Caper & Olive Relish. $11.00) - Lovely TENDER and I'm not describing a Girl, I'm describing the Calamari. Fan'd 

Paul's Favorite Spaghetti(Plum Tomato Sauce, Bell Peppers, Mushrooms, Herbs & Garlic. $15.00) - Chose Meat rather than Vegetarian option which meant Ground Beef. Plenty of sauce was offered with strands of Al-Dente store bought Spaghetti hidden throughout. A-OK 

Seafood Risotto(Tiger Shrimp, Baby Clams, Mussels, Calamari, White Wine & Tomato. $20.00) - Good: Perfectly cooked Seafood with plenty of Mussels to share and looks Paella-like. Bad: Risotto was over-seasoned with Salt. Could-be-better."}
{"text":"We had been anxiously waiting to try Paul's Spaghetti, and we finally had a chance to last Saturday! 

Let me start off by saying that service here was excellent! They are attentive without being pushy, and super nice. 

Since we were so excited about coming here, we ordered a bunch of things to share. To start, we ordered the Grilled Calamari and the Meatballs. They are both great choices and I would order them both again. The calamari was perfectly grilled; not in the least bit overcooked. It comes with a tomato, sun-dried olive and caper relish which was so yummy. The meatballs are at the top of my list in terms of my overall favourite dish ordered that night. They were tender and the sauce is amazing! 

For our entrées, we ordered the Rigatoni with Spinach and the Seafood Risotto. I really liked the pasta, which comes in a cream sauce with roasted red peppers, baby spinach, sweet red onion, toasted pine nuts, basil and goat cheese. The goat cheese added a nice tangy note, which was a great compliment to the cream sauce. The Seafood Risotto came packed with seafood, which we appreciated, but it was a little on the salty side, and the rice seemed to be a tiny bit undercooked. 

The House Salad that came with the entrées were good, as was the bread that was brought to our table prior to our entrées arriving. 

We probably won't order the Seafood Risotto again, but we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Paul's spaghetti is the definition of a neighborhood gem. Located in a nondescript residential area in East York, the restaurant doesn't look too special if you judge it by the store front. I've been passing by this joint for many years before finally giving it a try. 

While the dining room is pretty small (read; come early or make reservations), the patio is open during nicer weather which effectively doubles their seating capacity. The dining room is comfortable and cozy with a vibe somewhere between 'intimate date night' and 'family restaurant'. There is a small parking lot but most diners have to park on the side streets (be careful of one way streets and no parking areas).

The menu is fairly condensed, with entrees mostly focused on pasta dishes - there is a small selection of meat and seafood entrees. I tried the calamari appetizer ($11) and the farfalle with shrimp ($23). I have to admit that I was not expecting too much but I was pleasantly surprised with their seafood! For $11, the portion of calamari was generous. We were given 3 large and tender pieces, grilled to perfection and served with a fresh tomato, caper and olive salsa. The farfalle was garlicky and flavourful, and the grilled shrimp had a fantastic char. Portion sizes are large and each entree comes with a garden salad (upgrade to caesar salad for $3). 

While I really enjoyed the seafood (as did my family, the seafood linguine was delicious and great value for $24), I thought that overall the dishes were on the salty side. Next time I come back I would request a lighter hand on the salt."}
{"text":"The food is great. Price point is moderate, but ranges to $40ish for special entrees. The calamari appy is a treat. Portions for mains are generous, with most featuring salad+starch sides. Service is average to better-than, even when it's busy, which is often. Food is delicious and not too rich, though 2 of our group of 6 felt there was too much salt on the seafood mains (not the calamari though) and I have seen some reviewers concur. 18% auto-gratuity on tables 6+ is the higher end of standard but perfectly reasonable. I've been here before and I will come again. Lovely place for an ambient family dinner for those who enjoy tucking in, nice place for a mellow/mature date.

Pro tip: This place is popular with its many regulars, make a reservation or be prepared to wait. Accessible bathroom upstairs by coat area supplements additional downstairs facilities."}
{"text":"The mood was excellent! A nice cozy romantic environment and the food exceeded expectations! Pasta was delicious, Cesar salad was great and the chocolate cake (big enough to share) SO GOOD! I will be going back!"}
{"text":"This email family owned restaurant is amazing! Is delicious and portion is big for the price. Totally worth it. The bread are soft like cloud and crispy on the outside. The onion soup is the best I've ever had in Toronto. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"A real quaint neighbourhood Italian restaurant.  Nothing too fancy, but simple homemade food.  Service is good. Found this place by accident.  It's not around other stores and restaurants so you might not know it's there.  Worth a visit and support locally."}
{"text":"Probably the best seafood pasta I've ever had. So so delicious and tasty. Absolutely love the amount of garlic and richness in the sauce! So so good. Whenever I have seafood pasta I always compare it to Paul's. the service is amazing as well - they're attentive and friendly. Definitely recommend Paul's"}
{"text":"A great little family restaurant hidden in East York, the small dwelling adds to its romantic atmosphere. The food is just bang on. I was always a veal or Chicken Parm fan, but I've been taken over by the Chicken Marsalla, you will cherish every bite."}
{"text":"We just moved to the neighbourhood and came upon this gem last Saturday.  Wonderful food and service!"}
{"text":"After seeing positive reviews here, I recommended to try this restaurant with my family for my sisters birthday. We made reservations since the place was very small. 

The server was very friendly and tried their best but felt some aspects lacking. 

The good points:
- Received complimentary slice of cake 
- Friendly and attentive but slow service 
- Complimentary bread was fresh 
- Food was good but not amazing 
- Price was average for an Italian place 

The not so good points:
- Restaurant is small and cramped, not recommended for large groups 
- Noisy and loud atmosphere when restaurant is at full capacity 
- Seafood risotto was undercooked 
- Food took longer than expected 
- Had to repeat order or items which was forgotten 

Overall, I think this place is cosy and had a quaint vibe. I would recommend coming here in small groups. It's nice to go to once in awhile but I wasn't overly impressed to come back immediately."}
{"text":"Terrible service...there are so many great restaurants with quality service in Toronto. Don't waste your money here. The food is respectable but not great. Owner had an opportunity to correct shameful service to our table yet chose to bicker over the final bill.  Over priced."}
{"text":"Went to Paul's Spaghetti today and had an altogether good experience. The decor is classy but not fancy. You can show up in your regular clothes. My Dad had a salmon dish he seemed to really enjoy and I had penne with sausage that tasted good. The service was good. Nothing blew me right out of the water but it was good. :) 

I read a comment above about saltiness of the food. My pasta was a little salty but not salty enough to make the food bad. If you hate salt don't go here. If you grew up by the ocean everything will taste just right.

After two main courses, two cocktails, a glass of wine and two desserts our bill was around 100$."}
{"text":"Why I like Italian food?? I love tomatoes, pasta in any form, seafood... and meat sauce! 

Paul's Spaghetti simple and down to earth menu satisfied all my cravings. The interior is rustic Tuscany feel.. wooden table, non matching dining chairs.. dimmed romantic candlelight (really suck if you trying to take photos of anything!) 

Sweet lovely pretty smiley Asian waitress... with cute smile and twinkle in her eyes.. does make my friend wants to order from her (or take her order) instead of me... 

Grilled Calamari 
- oh so tender... forget Calamari is high in cholesterol! just enjoy that! I am not too crazy about the sauce.. but my dinner mate was soaking up the sauce with the bread. 

Paul's Favourite Spaghetti (meat sauce) with house salad
- There are definitely more sauce than the pasta! And me as a pasta person was eating the pasta more than with tons of sauce left. The sauce must be really good because my dinner mate was just spooning up all the sauce and eat it as it is...Wish the pasta is fresh instead of the dried version. But with that price of $15 with such a big portion and load of beef in the sauce.. it is understandable! 

Seafood Risotto with house salad
- We went WOW..with all the mussels yes almost 2 dozen of them! The mussel are nice and fresh... I love PEI mussels... I found the Risotto is so salty!! I just could not handle that... so I just ate all the seafood instead. 

I found Paul's Spaghetti does serves really good Italian food and in a more homey environment! The portion is huge and is great for value oriented person like me! 

However I found most of the sauces are a little too salty for my taste.. maybe I can request less salt next time?"}
{"text":"Lovely little place we decided to check out. Service was impeccable - friendly and attentive. We of course ordered the spaghetti. It was fine but I wouldn't quite categorize it as great. Nice ambiance."}
