{"text":"My friend and I were a little peckish after an evening shopping at Woodbine.  We stopped here for a souvlaki, which was adequate if a little bland.  

Employees appeared more interested in serving a rather loud fellow in a red tie.  Although I can understand regulars getting special attention, we were annoyed that we could not get a refill on our tea, despite asking twice.  To top it off, the regular hit on my friend repeatedly and the staff made no attempt to intervene.  Upon my suggestion that he perhaps return home to sleep off what appeared to be a rather drunken stupor, he leered suggestively and insisted that tonight he was determined to eat out.

Needless to say, my friend and I left rather hurriedly."}
{"text":"Happened to be in the area, saw it come up on yelp and knew right away I knew exactly where I was going to be having lunch (yes I've seen the Ford video).

The steak on a kaiser is listed as a house specialty so figured I couldn't go wrong.  Well...not exactly.  Steak was cooked correctly to medium and didn't have any of the gristle I was expecting to have to spit out.  Toppings were a bit sad, the lettuce being more white than green.  It could definitely use cooked mushrooms and cooked onions for toppings.  Fries were decent and crispy, although I prefer a more natural real potato fry than these frozen sticks.  

Overall it's hard to rate it lower given that I've never really eaten up here.  If it's good enough for the mayor then it's good enough for me."}
{"text":"Great place to go at 3AM if you drunkers know what I mean! A great variety of different meals, and at a fair price. Open all night, however service is a little slower at night."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place since I was 10 years old.  I haven't really tried to much of the menu because I like sticking to what I know, and what I like.

That being said I usually go for the near perfect chicken or pork souvlaki dinner.  This souvlaki is always cooked to perfection, comes with good fries, an awesome greek salad, and rice which comes with this amazing sauce that they drizzle on top, the tzaziki is homemade and incredible.  To top it off they always serve your dinner with a fresh butter toased bun.  Just amazing.  

This is a diner type atmosphere, older building and older seats.  They have cool old school arcade games too, to play while waiting for your food.

I love this place!!!"}
{"text":"5 Stars based on this movie alone!!!!!!!!! 

You know the food is damn good when a FAT man comes in, and starts speaking Patios :)

{"text":"Getting some car work done in the area and wanting some real breakfast food, we spotted this little Greek hut. \"24hrs open with breakfast served all day starting at $2.99.\" Check!

It's your typical greasy spoon, ordering a Spanish omelette platter (rye toast and home potatoes), three eggs platter (rye toast, home potatoes and bacon). 
You order at the till and head down the line to watch your food being made on the grill and try to hold back the salivation. 

I was satisfied with my meal. Although, there was ALOT of onion in my omelette, I  liked it a lot. The best part were the potatoes, soft with a brown crisp on the outside. Add ketchup and you got it made! :)

The price was right under $12 for two big breakfasts!"}
{"text":"With a name like steak queen..  I would have tried it if I was feeling up to a big meal but opted from the poutine instead.  My boyfriend ordered a burger and fries off the specials menu, which included a free drink as well.  

The poutine gravy resembled that similar to KFC, same consistency but the flavor was alright.  Fries were okay.  Can't go wrong.  

Had a chance to try some of the burger and found it to be quite flavourful and decently portioned.   

This place resembles one of those old style diners with the seats that flip up. And some pictures on the wall that you can look at while you wait for your order.  

It was alright to visit because we were across the street getting my car rust proofed, but I wouldn't exactly go out of my way to visit unfortunately."}
{"text":"It had been years since I went to Steak Queen. Back in the day we'd read the Racing Form before the occasional visit to Woodbine, so when we were back in the area we thought we'd pop in. It looks to have gotten a little grimier over the years but not enough to turn one away.

I went with my old order, a cheeseburger and the chicken wings. The burger was very good but nowadays a good burger can be had fairly commonly, so the competition is tough and I don't think Steak Queen necessarily excels. The wings were as I remember them. You don't get Steak Queen wings because you want good wings. You get them because you want STEAK QUEEN wings. What that means is dipping them into their unique tomato-cream dipping sauce. What can I say, it tastes like my youth! :)

Overall the food is good. But jaunt over to Airport Rd and have Zet's if you REALLY want something!"}
{"text":"I'm another who has joined the haj, to walk in the foot steps of the late, great Mayor Ford. Despite the notoriety this place has been given by our racist, anti gay, anti Kevin Spacey, drug using, drinks himself into blackouts mayor Herr FÃ¶rd, I have to say it couldn't have happened to a nicer mom n pop type place. The menu is quite extensive. The prices are low. The food hits all your old school greasy notes. And it's 24 hours."}
{"text":"You would think steak queen would make good steak right? 

wrong!! We ordered steak, medium well, and we got a fast FRY think piece of overcooked beef.

It definitely was a fail! Even the gravy that came on the fries, tasted odd. They need a new cook, to be successful.

Would not recommend"}
{"text":"I remember coming here years (ok decades) ago and enjoying the food a lot.
Pretty sure that management has changed a least once since then.
Not for the better unfortunately.  Greasy spoon is an apt description.  Everything a a patina of grease, just an overall grungy feel to the place.
But it's was 4am and not much else was opened so I go a cheeseburger and fries.  Fries were mushy and the burger was bland.
Basically the only thing to recommend the place is that it is open 24 hours."}
{"text":"I love going here. In my 10+ visits, the food has always been excellent. 

The all-day breakfast is great, with the largest option giving you a plate full of food for under $10 (eggs, bacon, sausage, ham, fries, and toast). Their dinners are delicious too. Average dinner price is $8-$12. Common choices are burgers, souvlaki, and of course, steak.

The place has an older diner-type feel. There's no waiter service. They are open 24 hours. With a couple TVs and cheap beers, it's a great spot.

I also hear Rob Ford stops by sometimes. What more do you want? Good food and a chance to see a world famous celebrity.

{"text":"Great food for late night cravings.

Souvlaki is the best here, but they also have steaks or fish and chips."}
{"text":"A friend and I pulled up to this place later on in the night and we were immediately recommended the Souvlaki on a bun by a customer waiting outside. This being our first time here we decided to get the Souvlaki on a bun and because it was called \"Steak Queen\" we also ordered their New York Sirloin. First off, the salad dressing tasted like it was some sort of peanut butter vinaigrette. The rice was so overcooked almost to the point where it was like eating a jar of Gerber's baby food. Their French Fries were limp and soggy. The Souvlaki chicken was mediocre at best. It was tossed on top of a bun and just drenched in Tzatziki sauce as if trying to mask the blandness of the meat. Finally we come to the New York Sirloin Steak...I honestly felt like I just microwaved a Hungry Man's TV Dinner. This was the worst steak I have ever had. Period. It was not Rare like I had ordered but almost well done. It was incredibly salty and just the hardest thing to swallow. Their food is just terrible. If you are hungry and it is late, go to McDonalds do not waste your time and money at Steak Queen.

The meal went immediately into the garbage after only a few bites.

Stay clear fellow Yelpers."}
