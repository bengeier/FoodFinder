{"text":"Excellent service and for the price food was very good...will try carry out delivery."}
{"text":"Not very good. Fried rice was sticky and no taste. Looked more like Mexican rice. Beef broccoli and orange chicken were both bland and no flavor. Worst egg roles I have ever tasted. 

Not sure I will give them another chance. Too many good Chinese restaurants available to go back to a poor one."}
{"text":"Great customer service. Chicken Teriyaki was delicious. Pretty fast delivery. I will definitely be eating here on my next visit."}
{"text":"So good... got the large pepper steak and large shrimp fried rice! ... would recommend and definitely will order here again... it's hard to find good Chinese food.. I was hesitant at first, but I'm glad I ordered!"}
{"text":"Another consistent order from Li's Asian, this place deserves a lot more credit for their tasty food! If you're thinking of getting some Asian take out, please eat here, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Well I tried this place on a whim and I was disappointed by the food and not having filtered water for their soda machine. On the food I guess they dumbed it down for Americans or the run over to Safeway to do their shopping..  just another failed attempt at Chinese / Japanese food.. if you like this place then please have your tastebuds checked."}
{"text":"I love Li's! I have ordered both sushi and their normal chinese food several times since discovering them. Their rolls are all VERY well priced for what you get. They are also very good (costs more at the grocery store and Li's is DRASTICALLY better). Don't get me wrong, its not the best sushi I've ever had but it is the best delivery and the best for its price. The food always tastes fresh. This coming from a sushi snob! (If you like RA's sushi, you don't get to have an opinion on sushi) 

I've seen the reviews about the fried rice looking like mexican rice and it does, however, it tastes perfect! I am very particular about fried rice and Li's is the only place I've tried that I've liked. :D 

The orange chicken is delicious. The lo mein is a bit oily but I'm sure you could ask them to use less.  

They have always been exceptionally friendly when I call and the delivery is prompt. This is my go-to delivery service."}
{"text":"I went here on a whim today. I wanted something different so I got sushi and my son got Kong Po Chicken with wonton soup. The soup is awesome, the sushi is good. I would only suggest on the Las Vegas roll they add jalapenos and my son said his food was great too. We will be back!

{"text":"I ordered Sweet & Sour Pork. When I picked up the order there was no sauce. I when back to get the sauce at this time  I checked the rest of the Meal. There was no green pepper,onion,or pineapple. Just the pork, I asked about this they said it's now this way not as shown on the Website.????"}
{"text":"Li's... more like lies. I received a very nice ad from this local restaurant and thought i would give it a try. I had a coupon for a free egg roll with a purchase of $15.00 or more. That being said, I decided that I would get a good amount of food to give this new (to me) establishment a shot. After placing the call to order our food we received our food about 1hr 15mins later. Starving at this point, we could hardly wait to divulge in what we though would be an amazing meal. After not even 2 bites in, we couldn't even finish our dishes. There are so many other authentic Chinese restaurants in the area that I would rather spend my money on. Not trying to completely destroy the place just didn't think flavor or texture was what it should be."}
{"text":"BEST CHINESE FOOD EVER. I love it because it's so close to my house. Great customer service. They just changed the menu and portions up. Their cheese wontons are amazing, as well as their lo mein."}
{"text":"Great Asian take out food. Me and my friend had been searching for a good takeout place for awhile as panda was just not cutting it for us. 
So my friend told me about this place so we decided to hit up after doing some shopping. And glad we did. Food was so good.

Sushi and Chinese food was a win win.
We got the house fried rice that was tasty with beef shrimp and chicken. With some wonton soup with a tasty broth and crunchy egg rolls.

Then for sushi we got the seafood dynamite roll with a Las Vegas roll. Both were delish. 

All in all a great place for yummy Asian takeout."}
{"text":"Good food for the price you pay. VERY nice customer service, which I love because I feel like that can be hard to find. Super close to our house and they deliver! LOVE that they have sushi too :) we order from her often and will continue to do so!"}
{"text":"Very good sushi.  Lunch menu is a great deal.  Two sushi rolls and soup for $9.  Enough for me to take half of it with me for dinner."}
{"text":"I guess I should of asked tonight but I come here at least once a week and I'm pretty sure the owners have changed. They were changing the decor..didn't recognize the cooks,  people up front and others I saw working. Just started eating and food has unfortunately changed. Sauces are not as thick..and egg foo young was sitting in a bath of grease...sooo bummed. It was my favorite...not sure if I will give it one more shot...probably not."}
{"text":"Sushi delivery. Usually faster than they say  and always super friendly. Way better than anything you could get at the grocery store. But better prices."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Awesome food! Awesome people! The people who work there have the highest of respect for customers and it makes you feel like royalty. Definitely would go back"}
{"text":"I love their Orange Chicken & Sesame Chicken! The employees are very nice and the sushi is also very yummy! Plus the prices are amazing!"}
{"text":"Does anybody know if this restaurant has been reinspected by the health department since they received 4 or 5 violations earlier this year?"}
{"text":"Food was very greasy and not very appetizing. By looking at it you just knew it would give you a tummy ache later. Not impressed and will not be back. Rice fried rice tasted like old oil and too much soy sauce."}
{"text":"Damn I love this place for delivery. I've ordered from them a bunch of times and have gotten different things each time-- surprisingly fresh and delicious every time! Consistency with food delivery is rare... So props to them, and I hope hope hope they can keep it up! 

I LOVE that they have a varied menu with sushi options. There was only ONE place that delivered sushi in my area so I'm thrilled there's finally another place to order from. Even better-- the sushi has been fresh and delicious, with generous helpings of wasabi, ginger, and soy sauce. Ordered during a hot afternoon and the sushi was packed with a bag of ice to keep it cool & fresh-- more bonus points!

Their sweet and sour chicken has gotten a huge thumbs up from my picky ass significant other-- fresh and crispy, with yummy sauce that is packed separate (which helps keep the chicken crispy during delivery!). We also love their gyoza and lo mein. I agree the fried rice could be improved, but I still thought it tasted fresh with no hard, stale bits like you sometimes get at other places.

TLDR; Super happy about Li's Asian-- they have your typical chinese and sushi choices but do it well, quick courteous delivery. 

I hope they can keep their quality and consistency up!"}
{"text":"Changes have ruined this place. It is unfortunate that they have changed recipes because the food was great before. Li's was our go to delivery place. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"Order sushi rolls and it's so delicious.  Drove from Mesa to this place. Will be going back"}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with their egg drop soup, it tastes fresh and like they actually made it there compared to other places that taste almost frothy and powdery. For the price you pay, you get great quality food and good sizes."}
{"text":"leave it to the Chinese to make anything into a fast food take out place ..... great concept if ure craving sushi but don't want to spend a lot of money ... u get what you paid for.... the udon soup was very bland... almost like water I had to add some soy sauce to it ... the place is clean... I would come back here again"}
{"text":"Very good! General tso's chicken is very good and fried rice is actual fried rice! Has peas, carrots and eggs in it! ;) good place only thing I didn't care for were the egg rolls"}
{"text":"Li's Asian is awesome! They have Chinese food and sushi so it's the perfect compromise for groups that have sushi lovers and sushi haters. They even deliver! My roommate and I love ordering in. It may not be the quickest, but it's delicious when we get it!"}
{"text":"I would echo the comments in the egg drop soup.   It was fantastic. My wife ordered the sushi and felt it was good and flavorful but not over the top good.  The tofu vegetable dish was good with wonderful flavor.  Price was okay for portion size. We would eat here again."}
{"text":"I have ordered 3 times so far. Delivery is always super quick. My daughter loves the wonton soup and sesame chicken. I have tried several sushi and sashimi options. Impressive! Our new Fave!"}
{"text":"Li's Asian is extremely flavorful, and fresh with something for everyone. If you enjoy traditional American Chinese cuisine like Orange Chicken, Lo-Mein, and service with a smile, go here! :D 

They also serve and deliver very delicious sushi and I will always keep ordering and coming in from time to time to enjoy Li's fresh flavors. 

Thank you Li! ^__^"}
{"text":"Their serving sizes are ginormous! For the price you pay you'd expect to get small portions but it's like a feast! Love that they have vegetarian options in ever dish they serve! Plus they deliver! I definitely recommend coming here if you're having one of those crazy cravings later in the day and you want some bomb food!"}
{"text":"Very fresh ingredients! I went to another Chinese restaurant in the area recently and this place is so much better and the same price. Generous sizes"}
{"text":"We've been ordering from Li's for years and have always loved it. Food has always been  delicious and consistent. I ordered a few weeks ago and the orange chicken was very different and disappointing. Fried rice was also bad. I figured it was a fluke, maybe a new cook, and ordered again tonight. Food was terrible. They must have changed ownership and the recipes. So disappointing as we loved this place. Went from a solid 5 star to a really weak 1 star. Won't be ordering again."}
{"text":"Ordered the teriyaki chicken dinner combo - egg roll was ok but the fried rice, chicken and veggies were amazing! I've never had such delicious chicken teriyaki. Also ordered crunch rolls which were fantastic. The best part may have been the customer service - we stopped by to take food to go after a bicycle ride and the lady behind the counter must have seen our bikes. She tied the bags together in such a clever manner it was easy to put over our handles and she wrapped up a bag of ice inside the sushi bag to keep it cold! That's good customer service!!!"}
{"text":"The location is clean and easy to find.  Being Sunday dinner it wasnt that busy. First time eatting here and i was actually very surprised. We ordered 2 rolls that were fresh and really flavorful.   We ordered dumplings but nothing special. pass on that next time.  noddles and rice were good....other reviews compared fried rice to mexican rice. I actually like thia rice....nothing like mexican rice.  all the entrees were delicious fresh and tasteful. mongolian beef , general tso chicken and garlic chicken were great! be back again"}
{"text":"Had some sushi delivered again and it was superb! My husband had the orange chicken and he thought it tasted a little fishy but overall the sushi was very good fast delivery and ohhhh they use sushi rice now!!!! Will continue on bringing business (^_^)"}
{"text":"I loooved this place! It's so hard to find an all-around good Asian take-out, but this place was on point for everything we ordered. Plus they have sushi AND deliver? Awesome. The staff was really friendly and our food was made quickly. Sushi tasted fresh. Plus plenty of food for leftovers! They definitely have my bid for next time!"}
{"text":"Nice for a quick dinner. The miso soup was not very hot.  The sushi rolls tasted pretty good and fresh. Not a place I would drive out of the way to return to but it was a good dinner"}
{"text":"I am so glad i tried their sushi!  I felt a hankering for Chinese so I remembered their mailed flyer with a coupon.  It was nice that they had sushi and a variety of Chinese entrees.  Great prices and they are huge portions!  I actually over ordered thinking it would be small pieces but I sure was nicely surprised.  Their Seafood Dynamite roll was WOW! $9.50 that must have weighed 1/2 a pound. It had real scallops and about 8 pieces of big sushi.  It was topped with a great seafood sauce but a little too much eel sauce. A bit too sweet for my taste but I made 2 meals out of it.  I couldn't even start on the 8 piece california roll or rainbow roll.   The california roll was much better than Pei Wei's overpriced, much smaller portion.  The house lo mein was good for the $10 price since it had a combo of shrimp, beef, and chicken and also must have weighed a pound.  It could easily feed 3 -4 people. I only wish it wasn't udon noodles. but rather chow mein noodles. It was convenient since I also had to get gas and pick up groceries so it was a convenient location  The staff was nice and helpful. You can eat in but I took out.  It was a reasonable wait.  Very affordable. I will be back."}
{"text":"I recently did take out again and it was delicious and plentiful.  I have not eaten there, more than once, because I enjoy the comforts of my own home.  The restaurant is rather bare bones, bright, friendly staff, and clean, but I look at them as a take out place.  I can't imagine how large their large portion would be because the regular portions appear to be large to me!
Fresh ingredients, I ordered kung pao shrimp and counted 8 large shrimp and lots of bright veggies for under $8.  Slightly greasy (one star off) but bursting with flavor.  A great value and good tasting experience."}
{"text":"Just opened. Very clean, mix of booth style seating and some chairs. Menu is extensive with a mix of Japanese and Chinese foods. I tried the Gyoza which is the deep fried style not pan-fried and steamed. Nice dipping sauce. House fried rice was tasty and not over oily. Took a big chance and tried their yellowtail (hamachi) sushi and it was pretty good and made to order. The place has somewhat of a fast food Asian feel but with some nice touches. Food is cooked to order. No beer but I will certainly return. CHEERS!"}
{"text":"I got immediately sick from eating the nasty, revolting, disgusting food from this place. Not only did I feel sick immediately after eating it, it was revolting on the way down. Their chicken was many colors between pink and brown, but never white. The teriyaki was watered down and tasted like something from a can you'd find in a third world country. And their fried rice was ORANGE. Not a brownish color from being cooked in soy sauce -- bright, almost florescent, ORANGE. What could possibly make it that color?!?!! Even their vegetable fried rice had like 2 vegetables in it from a larger sized container... not that I'd eat it (because of its color,) just something I noticed. I'd eat garbage - and probably be better off - before eating this ever again."}
{"text":"Ordered house pad thai- ingredients were fresh, food was hot, but there wasn't really any flavor. Husband ordered chicken fried rice & felt the same."}
{"text":"We ordered from here last year for delivery and everything was SO fresh. Finally convinced the family to try it yesterday. Everything is fresh, made to order, hot and the service is amazing. 

I got the Teriaki chicken combo and an order of the crab rangoons. Some of the best I've had."}
{"text":"Delicious food, perfectly seasoned (that happens rarely), large portions, and AMAZING lunch deals!!  Even my picky daughter ate well."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't found this place till now!  As far as I know it's the only place that will deliver sushi in my area.  I got the dragon roll and it was fantastic.  Also I had wonton soup and a green salad. The dressing for the salad was so yummy I'll have to ask next time if I can just order a bunch of it to use on my own salads. Delivery was only about 20 minutes and the delivery man was very sweet.   Just plain awesome!"}
{"text":"Quick and Good Lunch stop in south Tempe.  The ownership just changed and are very attentive.  Lots of vegetables and brown rice is a standard offering.  This is definitely one of my noontime go-to spots when I'm in a hurry."}
{"text":"We've ordered from li's quite a few times, it's close to the office and the prices are good however  today was pretty disappointing. I found a straight black hair in my white rice, needless to say I didn't finish my lunch and my coworker ended up making a few trips to the bathroom...I think it may be awhile before I can convince my office to order from here again."}
{"text":"Great place to order delivery! Never had a complain or issue. The sushi is great, and the food has a good taste. Always prompt and the delivery fee is small."}
{"text":"Good simple Chinese, their food is always fresh, Lo Mein and Chopped Pork are really good.  They need to cook their Cheese Wonton longer, those are my favorite thing at any Chinese place, and the two times I've ordered they weren't cooked (fried) long enough.  I definitely want to try their sushi!"}
{"text":"Great food! Ordered over the phone and by the time I was there it was ready. Definitely a good value, two dinners were enough for three or four people."}
{"text":"I ate their food for the first time last week.  I had the vegetable lo mein.  Very good and there was lots of veggies with the noodles.  Often vegetable lo mein just has some bits of green cabbage and not much else.  I will definitely return.  It seems like most of their business is delivery and pickup.  Not a real sit down restaurant, just a few booths and tables."}
{"text":"This place is so fresh and so good! You can tell everything is made to order and everything comes out hot!! Large portions and great lunch combos for such a great price and great service too, the man at the counter was so nice and attentive. Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Restaurant location is convenient, dining area is perfect for area lunch crowd, menu pretty extensive cuz it includes sushi, sashimi, and sushi rolls in addition to your traditional Asian fare.  The Steamed Dumplings were tender and flavorful without the dipping sauce, General Tso seemed to be on the sweet side even though it's supposed to be spicy, and the Lo Mein was excessively oily, but overall the entrees tasted good.
Staff is polite and efficient and the young lady at the counter is knowledgeable of products available.  She overheard me express interest in chili oil and brought me a bullet for my entree.

I suppose prices are reasonable.
And they really do have a variety of menu items.
We'll be back."}
{"text":"From the rolls to the dishes- all have been very fair in cost and quality considering  this is fast food Asian 
I wish they would do the inside better, for those who want to stop in and eat. 
Styrofoam and cheap plastic ruins a dine in experience.the chicken is questionable in quality. Yet the rolls are great."}
{"text":"Li's Asian is just alright. 

The place is conveniently located in a South Tempe Safeway Plaza, it's clean and the dishes are affordable.

The food is meh. 

I had never been in until my Dad got out of the hospital for a major heart surgery and finally got his appetite back ... For takeout Chinese!

*Food police, CHILL OUT. His surgeon and cardiologist said it was OK on this particular occasion as Pops was barely eating since he got home.* 

Some of the things we've tried: 

1) Hot and Sour Soup
2) Mixed Fried Rice 
3) Orange Chicken 
4) Egg Roll 

Three of these items, specifically the Orange Chicken, was swimming in an abundance of oil.  

Pops and my brother mentioned the Mixed Fried Rice was uber salty. The rice also looked like rice at Mexican restaurants. Odd indeed.

Pretty bland overall, not what one would expect from a neighborhood place like this. 

Bummer, because on both occasions the counter staff and gal that took my phone order were very polite and customer service oriented.

Maybe I'll pop into Lis Asian again in the future, but  wasn't memorable enough for it to be on my short list of takeout places that come to mind."}
{"text":"Not my cup of tea. Overcooked chicken teriyaki. Too much sauce. Unappetizing. The only thing that was good was the egg drop soup. So sad, I wanted to like this place. Maybe I'll try another dish."}
{"text":"good food, excellent fast home delivery. we always order noodle dishes with extra meat or shrimp. Very reasonable prices too."}
{"text":"The sushi at Li's asian is probably the worst I have ever had. The spicy tuna mix tastes like how a fresh caught fresh water fish smells. The salmon and the tuna were frozen, which goes against all sushi code. Nothing about the sushi is fresh. The sauce was awful, and I'm not just  talking about the soy sauce. I would not suggest Li's Asian sushi to anyone. Their actually cooked dishes might be different but I am speaking strictly from a sushi standpoint."}
{"text":"This place is remarkable. Kind faces greet you upon arrival, the food was fresh, yet speedy. I'm anxious to dine here again."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery, person on the phone was quite pleasant.
Sushi was good! Fried rice has pretty legit veggies, not just humdrum carrots and peas. Portions are generous. My only complaint is the noodles in the chicken lo mein were soggy, although I really shouldn't complain since it was free with a coupon on our menu. 
It also arrived in a half hour when I was told 40 minutes . I will definitely be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"I dropped in to Li's on my way out of the grocery store, in a time crunch, and feeling hangry.  I decided to see if I could get quickly get some vegetable fried rice for take out.

The friendly person taking my order was understanding about my hurry and got the cook going on my rice ASAP.  It came out super fast and smelling delicious!  Plus the gentleman cooking my food even gave me a nice look/head nod from the kitchen as he handed my order up front.  Good customer service is so nice to encounter. 

The fried rice WAS tasty!  It was packed full of large pieces of fresh vegetables: mushrooms, pea pods, water chestnuts, carrots, broccoli, squash, etc...  Plus, the serving size was generous for the amount paid.

I had friendly, fast service and delicious food.  Thumbs up, for sure!"}
{"text":"Only my 2nd time eating here but Im hooked.  Each time the food was good. The food is wonderful and the portion sizes is worth the money! My first time trying a combo meal instead of the dinner option only because I was picking up food for myself. Let me tell you the combo portion is enough for 2 people and under 10.00.  They even give you microwavable to go containers so you can eat the leftovers the next day. I have eating the leftovers the next and it taste just as good! No other Chinese take out place has this greatness. Next day takeout chinese is usually gross. Not this place. Will be a returning customer!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of the lunch menu portions and value & everyone here is friendly and accommodating. I have a few other places as a top pick when it comes to Asian dining but I've been happy with everything on the menu. Typically everything for me is for Pickup & I like how they setup the plastic bags for easy opening or how the sushi items comes with a small pack of ice. I'm not a fan of the plastic utensils when dining in. When I sit at a restaurant, I like to have hardware"}
{"text":"Just had the Seafood Dynamite and it was so delicious!! I meant to take a picture but I ended up eating it too fast. So yummy."}
{"text":"Second time coming here. The staff is wonderful and helpful. The restaurant is very clean and organized, which is great. Too often at many asian establishments, there seems to always be clutter of cups, napkins, and magazines. Not the case here, as everything is nearly organized. There was subtle Asian music in the background and the sizzling of pans from the kitchen. 

They have a pretty extensive menu with all of the normal Chinese dishes, plus a pretty diverse sushi menu. The Kong Pao chicken I had was great, but I felt like it could have used a little more chicken. The rice and Hot and Sour soup were both excellent. I'm a fan of spicy food, and the Kong Pao wasn't all that hot- but, they had huge bottles of sriracha, so I'm good. 

The sushi is good. Most rolls are under $5. It's not the absolute best, but for the price and convenience it's great. 

The only negative aspect is the fact that everything, including the soup, is served in cheap plastic. Having actual dishes for dine-in would be awesome. 

Fast, clean, inexpensive, tasty, and convenient. I'll be back again."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi place. I've never tried their other food, just their sushi (I have had lots of sushi in my day. Love their Tempe rolls!) It's excellent. All the sushi I've had there has been super tasty. The folks who work there are friendly as well. The place is always very clean with a low level of Chinese music always playing. Two thumbs way up. The next time you are craving sushi, go to Li's Asian, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We tried the Japanese food there. The service is incredibly fast and everything is served on Styrofoam or plastic. The fish tasted fresh but the flavors didn't really come together. The pieces are also small and the rice isn't sushi rice.. which didn't help with the taste.

For the price, it's fair, but I've had better for that price. I might come back and try the Chinese food."}
{"text":"By far the best Chinese food in my area!! Everything is super fresh and the delivery is always fast!! This place is my favorite!!!"}
{"text":"We've been ordering takeout/delivery from this place for years.   Food is always yummy.    Had a problem with my order.  Went back the next day and they remade the meal for me.  It was also delicious.  

This place is not fancy but the food is superb."}
{"text":"The family that runs this place is awesome! Great customer service with fast service. We have been here many times and never been disappointed. The special chicken wings are one of our favs. Super saucy and perfectly cooked. The only thing that I wished was better was the house fried rice. I LOVE fried rice and there fried rice is not her flavorful. 
Overall Li's is a staple in our families take out options."}
{"text":"We ordered from this place because we had a menu on our door with 50% off. So we ordered the general tsos chicken, mongolian beef, gyoza, spring rolls, fried rice, a spicy cali roll and the Las Vegas roll. We LOVE everything but the rice and the gyoza. The spring rolls are probably in the top 5 for me and I grew up on Asian food. The sushi rolls were so fresh, now when I order I only order sushi and my husband sticks to the general tsos chicken with brown rice. Recently I ordered sushi for myself and upon signing the receipt, I noticed there was a shrimp roll. As I'm allergic to shrimp, I knew I had not ordered it. No big deal, but they packaged another roll I had ordered, with it. So the delivery driver, said he would take care of it. He took both rolls back and shortly later I got a phone call with an apology and a discount next time I order. Plus he brought back the original roll and another roll. I was pleased with the customer service and because of that and the fresh sushi, we will continue to frequent this Chinese food place."}
{"text":"Smiling. This is GREAT food for the price. Quick food and friendly service. Thank you for being available at extended hours."}
{"text":"Great food. I don't have anything else to write. Yelp won't me post this review without more writing."}
{"text":"We ordered food from there before and it was fine. Today was no good! We ordered a shrimp lo mein and a chicken terryake to go.  My shrimp lo mein was loaded with cabbage and snow peas, MSG sauce and NO NOODLE! Chicken Terryake was not sweet, it was loaded with vegetables, messy and there were very little chicken pieces. Both dishes were drowned in MSG sauces. We went back to the restaurant and they argued that the dishes were done right. We won't be back."}
{"text":"The new crew is doing a very bad job! This was one of my favorite restaurants - and the food is just bad: dry and far too salty! No place to go anymore ..."}
{"text":"i work right next door so i'm always ordering food from here and it's absolutely delicious!! being a vegetarian, it's kinda hard to find dishes at chinese places but their orange tofu is to die for! their staff is really nice and friendly as well!! best place in town"}
{"text":"They tried to charge me extra delivery fees. Then they cancelled my order but did not credit at card and tried to get me to place the order again. What a fiasco!?!?  Now I'm going out to dinner. Ehhh"}
{"text":"this east coast snob proclaims the chinese food I've tasted out here and the sushi is also very good. They've never messed up an order. I love them"}
{"text":"Stopped in here today based on a friend's positive appraisal. The place was very clean, easy to find, and smelled delicious. We've been hankering for a local place that serves up some old-school Chinese food that's fresh, hot, and doesn't turn our stomachs. I think we found it. Everything we ordered was piping hot and fresh. Crunchy veggies, flavorful chicken and beef, tons of eggs in the soup. Service was quick too. Will definitely be back, hope they stick around!!"}
{"text":"Great service, friendly folk here. Really good Asian food for a reasonable price, comes out fresh."}
{"text":"Tried this new place out and I wont be going back.  The rice is the WORST.  Its the type of rice you typically see in Mexican dishes and really weird to have in both the chinese food and the sushi.  The veggies in the fried rice tasted like they were the frozen bag variety and just the usual carrots and peas, no bean sprouts or any other goodies.  Beef was chewy, but the chicken was OK.  Noodles were also decent.  Bad rice at an asian place is a deal breaker tho."}
