{"text":"Great food, especially the brisket tacos.  The menu isn't huge, but if you're in the mood for burgers or tacos Mahall's is a good choice.  The jerkey appetizer is great if you like the idea of deep fried beef strips.  Haven't gone bowling there but will soon."}
{"text":"Ordered three piece chicken with corn bread (for $10, i figured it must be good). Took abnormal amount of time, and was given coleslaw instead of just being informed there was no more cornbread. 
After I sat and waited ten minutes just for that information, I decided to just eat and the chicken pieces were much smaller than expected. Won't be getting food again."}
{"text":"the bowling is old school (no overhead scoring) but the bar is nice and big, the service is a tad slow but very very friendly. the food is great. I eat out alot and this place is my new favorite, the burgers are the best ive ever had. imagine a family friendly place bye day and a hip cool place at night. This place kind of embodies what i love about the west side, re-imagining old stale places and making them new and fun.  Im even having my wedding after party there.  great place."}
{"text":"Met a dear friend on a Monday for brunch, I was completely disappointed with their menu selection. (Celiac/Vegetarian) I settled for a parfait, asked for them to hold off on the granola. We sat at the bar, friendly bartender promptly took our drink orders. I ordered a mimosa, it took ages to actually get the drink. My friend had to remind the bartender a few times, I'm so easy going I wasn't took ticked. We got our food not long after, they forgot to hold off on the granola. So I basically ate around it, I hate to complain! The parfait in itself was great & the fruit was so fresh. I order another mimosa and the bartender yet again forgot. Possibly was too busy socializing with coworkers, so I decided to end our brunch a bit prematurely. I left convinced this one bad experience of service shouldn't ruin my overall love for Mahall's. I will return, just not for brunch."}
{"text":"This bowling alley has been around forever, as in my mother used to do her league bowling here when I was a kid in the 70s.  Within the last few years, new owners have taken over and turned it from just an old bowling alley into retro hipster heaven, especially on Friday and Saturday nights when live bands play.  On my last visit there on a Friday night, there were dozens of twentysomethings standing in line to bowl, two separate shows going on (one upstairs and one downstairs), and a guy with a man-bun playing the piano in the barroom  (which is separate from the show rooms). The decor is shabby chic - they peeled the walls and found old murals that look like they're from the 30s or 40s underneath and just left them, peely parts and all.  Where there were no murals, they hung some local Cleveland-oriented art.  
 
I don't bowl very often but they have booked some pretty good band shows and the vibe is a little more civilized than your usual divey show bar.  One big plus, it has a kitchen that stays open LATE.  Most of the music bars either don't serve food or close the food down around 11 or so, whereas this place serves up till midnight most nights and till 2 am on Saturday nights.  The menu is limited - burgers, tacos and chicken primarily, although they do have a weekend brunch - but it's pretty good and beats fast food (if you can even find an open fast food place at midnight) and also beats having to drive to a late-night place and re-park. Fried chicken, a specialty of the house,  is pretty good, although it's very uneven in quality from piece to piece and batch to batch.  I ordered a 3-piece and one piece tasted great, the other two pieces were overdone and one of them noticeably saltier than the other two.  I'd still get it again just in case the cook was having an off night.

The big band room has a LOT of comfortable seating along  a wall where you can still see the band but be out of the main sight and sound line.  There is also more comfortable seating and tables closer to the band, although people stand in front of you if you sit there. As an older person I would prefer to sit in a comfy seat and enjoy the sounds rather than stand up front in the band's face for 3 hours most of the time. So this is fine.  My only small complaint is there is no bar in the band room and you have to walk out of the music area, across the lobby and to the bar room to get a drink, but that's not the end of the world. 

Street parking is currently a little limited due to some huge construction going on across the street (which will further result in fewer parking spaces over there) but you can still find free parking on the side streets."}
{"text":"Food? Excellent! My friends and I order bean or vegan tacos all around and share some savory fries. The service is quick and the prices aren't that bad. Since I'm a teenager, I can only speak for the non-alcoholic beverages, and I'd say there's a decent selection. There's usually a water cooler by the bar if you want free water that isn't from the bathroom. I don't eat here every time I come, but I'm always up for it.

The atmosphere is bomb. Lately, I've been coming here in the evenings when the place is in full swing, which can result in having to wait for a lane. Usually I don't need to, but there have been occasions where I've waited for 45 minutes. That's a far cry from just two/three years ago when my friends could strut in and be the only people in the building besides an employee. Since then, Mahall's has changed management and has been completely revitalized. It's become a favorite hangout spot people regret having ever forgotten about. 

They've got a concert hall that's had some cool acts go in. Last week, Shannon and the Clams played there and unfortunately I missed it. In April, my service organization (H2O) partnered with Vance Music Studios and Ohio City Bicycle Co-op to host Bikes and Bands at Mahall's. It was a project some friends and I came up with and worked hard on for months, and the enthusiasm the management had to take on the project was outstanding. We look forward to working with them again in the future.

Overall, my only complaint is the occasional crowd. Like I said, I'm a teenager, so I'm not in the bar crowd, and when the bar crowd has the joint taken over, I'm kinda marginalized. However, the food is awesome, the bowling is classic fun, and I always love going there. It's a great example of how Lakewood's coming back."}
{"text":"I'm going to start by saying that mahalls is not your typical lakewood bar that specializes in bud lights and fireball shots.  I was there last Saturday to meet with friends,  catch a show, do some bowling and have dinner. The place was packed with about 200 people all there for a nice night out. 
      I want to say that I appreciate the authenticity of the bowling lanes and the owners not falling to the pressure of modernizing them. It's what makes mahalls special,  you can go anywhere for computer screens and moonrock bowling. It gives you a feel for what bowling was really like in the old days which is pretty cool. 
      Next I wanted to address the food. A friend of mine recommended the fried chicken claiming it was the best in lakewood, which is a high standard to live up to but I must say I was not disappointed.  I also like that they offer a variety of tacos (vegan especially).  It's not often a bowling alley/concert venue offers much more than fries and microwaved soft pretzles.
      Now with all the things that mahalls offers you can imagine it might be pretty packed on a Saturday night with 2 stages for music,  20 bowling lanes and amazing food. Not to mention an assortment of signature cocktails and an interesting selection of bottled beers and drafts that are not carried everywhere you go. It's nice to put the bud light down for a minute and try something that was made with a little more creativity and care. And for how busy it was i was very impressed with the timelyness of my service and appreciated the zest the bartenders had for serving as many people as they could as fast as they could.
      I will definitely return soon and often.  Thank you Mahalls for a wonderful night.  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"My fellow and I have been saying we'd go bowling only for like FOREVER (ok, just 6 months since that's how long we've been together) and finally got it together the other night to have a bowling date.  We headed over to Mahall's and had a great time!  The two guys at the counter were just the sweetest, welcoming guys- they were enough to make you want to make Mahall's your steady bowling spot.

We were assigned a lane upstairs and went about finding the perfect ball for ourselves (sadly they were not organized in any kind of way which sucks for those of us who aren't weight lifting champs- if I could take off a quarter of a star for that I think I might consider it) in the area just to the side of the counter.  They have a little polishing/ cleaning machine there in case you're fancy enough to have your own gear.  One nice aspect of Mahall's is that you don't have to hand in your own shoes and therefore avoid any kind of socks on the floor/ awkward standing and switching of shoes in everyone's way.  Weird people like me appreciate that.

The place is low key and fun- I guess when teams are there competing in their bowling competitions it might feel a little different.  We sat next to another couple who were equally unskilled and while they're not our new besties we did have a nice cheering section for stellar/ lucky maneuvers.  There seemed to be a couple of lanes occupied by tragic hipsters, however; I did not feel overwhelmed by a sense of irony for irony's sake.  Mostly it was folks out to have a good time.  

We were there on a Saturday night around 8:30pm and a few sets were made of late 20 somethings and early 30 somethings.  Another couple of lanes had teens and older folks who may have been their parents.  In another couple of lanes preteens seemed to be supervised by the parental units who took their turn with the youthful outing.

I didn't visit the downstairs half of the twenty lanes, however; I believe the bar is located down there.  I noticed a couple of pool tables behind the area where you pick up your shoes, get your lane assigned and pay for your game.  No info to report on that- I'm not a billiard player.  

The music playing was pretty safe- stuff your parents won't complain about and the teens won't be too disgruntled about either.  Some kind of basketballing event was happening on the tv.  It wasn't blasting and the non-sporters won't be forced to deal with the loud game announcers that might be dominating other bowling spots.

Some people have referred to this spot as vintage and maybe that is technically what it is, however; I'd say that makes it sound like effort was put into making it that sort of place.   I'd rather call it something that has maintained the same sort of low key atmosphere for a number of years.  There isn't anything pretentious about the place and I really appreciate that.  It's sincere in its style and not some place that tries hard to be anything different.  That's refreshing to me."}
{"text":"This aging relic at the far end of Lakewood will not impress you when you compare it to the more modern bowling palaces that have cropped up lately.  The place hails back to an age when Eliott Ness could have stopped in to make sure the fire exits were clearly marked. The lanes are old and the lights that mark your shot above the pins have long burned out.  There is, however, an antique charm about the place and the beer is definitely better than the old style PBR joints from the 70s and 80s.    Hopefully someday the place can be restored to its original glory and the menu can be expanded."}
{"text":"While Mahall's does have a cool vintage atmosphere, if you're a hardcore bowler you probably won't be that impressed. No overhead scoring, only twenty lanes (ten upstairs, ten downstairs), and their ball returns are kind of beat. They have do have a bar, which is nice. They don't have a kitchen. Prices were nice - $3 a game, $2 shoe rental, the staff was extremely friendly."}
{"text":"The fries were really extreme. They didn't have any other food but they were giving away buckets of fries and it was good"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in Lakewood. It's a bar/music venue/bowling alley with a divey, but not too divey feel. It's set up kind of weird, with a big venue room off to one side, the bar on the other side, most bowling lanes upstairs. a few lanes downstairs with another smaller venue and bar for music. So you can switch up the crowd or just post up and have a good time really anywhere. 

They have a pretty good beer selection, but I usually go with $3 cans of Dale's Pale Ale. The bartenders are usually pretty friendly and quick. They have some basic bar food available if you get the munchies. The people running the alley are always friendly too. One important note - this bowling alley is old school - you need to keep your own score! So either go with someone that knows what they are doing, download an app (there's probably an app for that, right?), or just go out there and have fun without keeping score. The only complaint I have is that I left my coat sittin on a chair in the alley and it was stolen, with my keys being thrown into the street. Luckily a staff member found the keys and brought them in. At least the thief was that kind! So beware, I would keep an eye on your belongings there - or maybe I just had some bad luck that particular night."}
{"text":"This place is Chris Hardwick's wet dream - a bowling alley that also has a performance space where comedy shows and small concerts put on by indie bands you've never heard of are held at least once a month. I write this as I wait for the $5 monthly SUPER SHOW to begin (second Wednesday of every month,  show begins at 8 : 00 and you should get there early because it fills up fast). The bar has a small menu with THE most amazing fried chicken you'll have on Cleveland.

EDIT: The Super Show is no more, I'm afraid. Other events still being held here!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Have been here for concerts, poetry readings, The Manhattan Project (which is where playwrights create a script based on a theme and have actors perform it, all within the span of a month), dinner, and to sit and study. The food is good and so are the drinks. 
Maybe one day I'll actually go bowling."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in Lakewood. Such a fun environment. The bowling lanes are retro (have to keep your own score), but very fun. One night they played The Big Lebowski on a big screen while bowling. The fairly newly renovated bar area is a great casual hangout area. They have done great things with the space as a concert venue. It is such a fun laid bak atmosphere to hear a band. Definitely not your average bowling alley!!"}
{"text":"I had my first date with my girlfriend here about a year ago. For Valentine's Day, they held a candlelight bowling event, so I booked a reservation. I misremembered the time of the reservation, and showed up an hour earlier than expected. They were still setting up the lanes downstairs. I couldn't wait because I had a restaurant reservation elsewhere for the actual time of the bowling reservation. The man behind the counter took care of us by letting us have a lane upstairs, for free, and they even threw in a complimentary glass of champagne for us on the house. I tried to pay for the it when we were done, because none of it was their fault, but they wouldn't have it. 

Mahall's regularly books musical acts and other cultural events such as poetry reading and open mic nights. They have a bar with a limited but excellent menu. They're a fantastic asset in the community, and have been now for almost a century."}
{"text":"Off the beaten path alley that can't be beat. Updated bar and food menu with top notch service.  Bowling in the basement takes me back to my grandma's house.  No electronic scoring here and ball return is classic old school. Great place for a great family outing."}
{"text":"We were excited to try Mahall's after hearing about its improved menu and draft list. We arrived on a Monday, for poetry night. Clearly, not your typical bowling alley, with local poets and artists enjoying an open mike night behind a red velvet curtain. Unfortunately, the air of hipster class that might work here is spoiled by terrible tap beer, burnt fries, mediocre burgers and a shortage of guacamole and pretzels on our visit. These things might have been forgiven by the respectable bottle list and cozy horseshoe booths but for the ostentatiously rude bartender that Monday night. Yes, we're all impressed by your trendy glasses and ironic sweater, but what would really be impressive would be a sense of gratitude, even faked, for our business. Dude, I came out on Monday night for burnt fries and mediocre poetry... The least you could do is smile."}
{"text":"Have known Mahall's since I was a young kid.  Now in my late fifties!  Finding new owners that have kept the original Family Name but brings a totally different atmosphere.  Had a chance to go for a staff party.  Bowled, had some drinks, listened to a band and had a great time. A bit more eclectic than I thought but none the less an enjoyable evening with coworkers.  Staff were helpful and very attentive.  I would go back again!  Decor was very unique and was an amazing make over. The bowling alley has kept the nostalgic look and it  brought back fond memories of when I bowled there as a young girl and how my husband and I met at Mahall's. and eventually married and came here as a family over the years.I hope the tradition lives on with our grandchildren. Mahall's has a rich and long history for us Lakewoodites and west Siders."}
{"text":"Mahall's is one of the top three bars in Lakewood for sure. Old school bowling that makes everyone quote Big Lebowski all night, live music that is easily accessible yet easily avoidable, and the cherry on top is Dale's Pale Ale costs $3. Their food is pretty good, albeit a little pricey. However, if you consider what their overhead must be to run that place I'd say the prices are totally in line."}
{"text":"Nice place. Very well decorated and friendly staff. We were here for a work party and at first I thought it was an odd choice. The lanes are very nostalgic and I live that they kept that 50s/60s feel in the alley part. We didn't try the food but the beer selection is great, and prices are reasonable. Great service at the bar even though it got a bit busy.

Kid friendly."}
{"text":"Not bad bowling,  basically a run down alley cleaned up a bit. Was going to have a drink but the bar staff was just visibly dirty,  to the point I had fears about ordering from them. I understand the hipster look but you can be cool and hygienic,  after all you are serving people"}
{"text":"So, we went to a Yelp party at Mahall's...and I have to admit, I'd never heard of it before last night.

I love surprises:)

Mahall's is a bowling alley in the CLASSIC style...as in this place still has the original lanes and set-ups from about the 1950's. No overhead screens and tech here folks; this places is so retro even hipsters were stunned:) 

We were in a set of lanes upstairs, and there was another set way downstairs in the basement, and it was really sort of cool to see the old-style way the place was set up. The staff was great, very kind and very helpful (hint; if your friends bowling balls get stuck in the return, DO NOT TRY TO HELP AND UNSTICK THEM! Let the staff do it!)

The other interesting thing about the place is the food and the bar. Everything is retro, and the place has a worn, comfortable feel. The food at the gathering last night was very unique, from barbequed peanuts, to fried chicken, cinnamon-sugar popcorn and pretzels whose shape I'm still trying to figure out. 

In another section, they have a small stage set up for concerts by local bands. Very close and intimate, very cool. 

Overall, a good experience and the party was fun.

However, one bit of advice...DO NOT DRINK AND BOWL...or mistakenly walk onto the lanes...cause you'll be fodder for a thousand YouTube videos later...

Anyway, try Mahall's; it just might set you up and knock you down:)"}
{"text":"Pretty killer spot. Bowling is super cheap. I don't drink but I guess the drunks are super cheap too. Food is usual bar food nothing special. Pinball and space invaders is a plus. Fun chill place, recommended."}
{"text":"Mahall's deserves 10 stars, to be honest. There's so much to enjoy here! This isn't your ordinary bowling alley. Not at all. At first glance, you'd assume this classic Lakewood landmark (which recently turned 90) is just old-school. Boy, would you be wrong. Three words for ya: Bowling, music, bar. I already explained one, but included inside is a luxury bar (I'm just being supportive), and it's newest addition: live music! You can hear local bands and artists perform just for you! Awesome, right?!! Well, what are you waiting for- go have fun!"}
{"text":"Right up your alley!

THE UP-SIDE:  This Lakewood bowling area has been around forever, and it shows.  However, it maintains a fun and pleasant atmosphere while offering two floors of bowling alleys.  This place is popular; and rightfully so.

THE DOWN-SIDE:  Yeah, it's older and well-worn in spots.  So am I.

THE SUM-IT-UP: Go here for some fun bowling in the kind of place you remember as a kid.  Expect no frills - just fun."}
{"text":"I like this place... It is super chill and the special mixed drinks that has beets in it is a plus!! The kereokee nights are always pleasant to be around. Nice vibe and people don't try so hard..."}
{"text":"Mahall's has gotten even better. They've opened up the downstairs so now they actually DO have 20 lanes instead of 10. 

I love what they've done with the downstairs. It looks adorable and it's even better than upstairs.

They're still working on things so excuse the dust. Rumor has it that they're building a stage where the old upstairs bar area was for shows."}
{"text":"We came here on Friday night for a work event. The atmosphere is extremely casual; the shoe rentals are at the front of the establishment, and there is a downstairs and an upstairs area. Our party was in the downstairs area. 

We had a wonderful time, but there were a few things that I noticed that weren't great. First, two of the lanes we had reserved, while not in complete disrepair, were certainly not incredibly well maintained. The lane farthest to the right completely broke while we were playing, and we were just down a lane; it looked as if a plastic bag got caught in the lane. The lane next to it was better but had a slightly broken ball detection mechanism, though it remained functional with some jiggering.

Also, there are two bars, one upstairs and one downstairs. The downstairs bar is fairly rinky dink with few options and no draft beer, while the other bar has draft beer along with a better selection of alcohol. Parity would have been nice.

That being said, the place is clean and has a great atmosphere, so I wasn't disappointed; I just felt the experience could have been better."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! Everyone makes you feel at home, and it has an awesome retro feel! Not to mention, the food is amazing!"}
{"text":"This place is a jewel. Came for Poetry readings, stayed for the comfortable, well-worn ambiance and friendly service. Talked up the friendly bartender (Liz?) for quite a bit. She was very enthusiastic about beer, which scores points with me and my friends - all of them snobby home brewing fanatics. Tried the Green Flash- it's a San Diego brewery- and it was indeed an excellent suggestion.  We talked to one of the other employees about the very interesting artwork on the walls. It was recently uncovered in their renovation after years of being hidden away. Surreal! This is an eclectic spot where you have options; you can be in a crowd or you can easily find a nice and quiet place to talk. The bowling lanes looked in terrific shape. Next time I'm bowling."}
{"text":"What Stefanie C. said.

Seriously, though. I had never been to Mahall's before the other day. I loved the vintage lanes and vintage everything for that matter! Hehehe, it WAS fun to try and figure out how to keep score. Somehow I won, hehehe... Probably due to the fact that we F-ed up the scoring ;)

These guys were very accommodating and yah, it's cheap. 

They have lots of colorful balls. Even blue ones."}
{"text":"I remember when I was a teenager tagging along here with my parents for their bowling league night when it was a lot of fluorescent lighting and Budweiser.
...and then one day all of a sudden there was cool wallpaper and delicious fried chicken and live music.  
Mahall's today is a comfortable blend of the old and the new-- and it feels just right for Lakewood."}
{"text":"Literally the very worst place I've ever come to have a drink.

Avoid this place and the idiot bartenders at all costs, or spend hours away from your group trying to get drinks."}
{"text":"Note:
We paid them a visit at 3pm on a Thursday. I can't speak to the live music or the food or any of that. We were on a mission and that mission was bowling.

As we were walking in a guy wearing glasses looked at us and asked, \"Are you here to bowl?\" Ummm, yeah. Why else would we be here? It was pretty strange. Completely empty and silent bowling alley. The lights weren't even on. Employees hanging out at the counter. They put us on lane 3 upstairs. 

Throw back. Waaayyy back. It's like someone took a bowling alley from 1963, sealed it in a time capsule and buried it in a building on Madison avenue. I hadn't been here in something like 4 years and the needle hasn't moved a bit. Sure, I'm all for cheesy retro shit and \"old school\" as the kids like to call it, but c'mon. There's retro cool and there's just plain rundown. The lanes are marred, chunks of wood missing, the racks work but the lights indicating which pins you've knocked down don't, and the ball return, don't get me started. And give me automated scoring any day of the week not this paper and pencil BS.

Blistered and peeling paint on the walls, no background music, a collection of the most misfit house balls I've ever seen (who the hell has fingers that small?). This place has it all. The entire time we were bowling there were loud, incredibly annoying buzzing and beeping sounds going off for whothehellknows what reason. And air conditioning? Nope. I was sweating like a whore in church by the time I'd finished two games. The guy behind the counter asked, \"How was bowling?\" \"Hot\", I responded. \"Well, why didn't you come out and tell me?\" Sorry, didn't realize climate control was by request only.\"

On the positive side, we did have the entire alley to ourselves for most of our time there. If there's one thing I like about people it's when they aren't there. Four games, two pairs of rental shoes, $18 and change. Five stars? WTF Are you people chewing coca leaves and drinking chicha? If you're looking to bowl there are better options. If you're looking to bowl ironically, I suppose it's OK. Three stars is generous, believe me. Hell, Cloverleaf Lanes makes Mahalls look like a spare parts yard. I don't get the draw of places like this. When did dingy, poorly lit and ill-maintained become cool? A dive is a dive. I don't care if they have poetry and bands. No thanks, 20 somethings that don't know any better can have it."}
{"text":"I can't believe I've never written a review for this place! I have been coming here for years and this is, BY FAR, one of my absolute favorite music venues. 

Not only is the place super safe (and clean!), but the entire staff is extremely accommodating and quick to resolve any issues (with drunk people, weirdo's, etc.). Scared to walk to your car after a show? They'll escort you. Drunk dude being weird? They'll take care of it. Need some cheap beer?! They have a bar! 

The venue itself (left from the door) is spacious and decorated in a way that is not only unique, but makes you wonder about the person(s) behind the decorations. It's just so unique the way everything is put together that I bet the staff is actually pretty chill. Lol. 

Bathrooms are super tiny and definitely not wheelchair accessible, but the concert room definitely is!"}
{"text":"There are few places I Cleveland as cool as Mahall's.  The fried chicken is incredible. The mixed drinks are excellent. The bowling is fantastic. Oh, and this trip I had the tacos, also stellar. Service is not the best ever but everything else is."}
{"text":"So good! I crave their fried chicken. Great burgers also. The menu is small but the prices are great. The crowd is mostly young but there are a few older folk around. Great beer selection and prices. Bartender was super friendly. I cannot get over this delicious food."}
{"text":"Great setup. Good, eclectic food menu and a strong beer selection, bowling lanes, and live music downstairs. Relaxed atmosphere.  The Beijing peanuts were awesome."}
{"text":"I attended Olde Wrestling's Speakeasy Spectacular at Mahall's 20 Lanes and played a round of bowling in the basement after the show. There are also bowling lanes available on the main floor. The venue also sells food and drinks."}
{"text":"Big space, all you'd expect in a bowling lane ... and then some. Cool bar right up front, with big windows overlooking Madison: a great place to drink when you're stuck in Lakewood on a snowy blizzardy night. And they have shows in the basement, more lanes too, and a cool loft upstairs. There's food, there's -- hey did I mention a cool bar? Well the new owners took off all the wallpaper and found the original painted walls from like the Twenties. Very neat Oriental designs with lamps and leaves, makes you wonder what kind of place this was at one time. Love the feeling of history that you get here!"}
{"text":"This is the ultimate bowling alley. Upon parking you might wonder if you should enter the premises. Don't give up and you will thank me. 

The entire place is filled with a hipster vibe. But not in a \"why didn't I ride my bike here or get an owl tattoo on my chest before coming\" way. Instead, you'll feel like you've always been a hipster without even trying ... And isn't that the point. 

There are two stories of lanes, two cool bars, a room filled with board games, and a shuffleboard table. Don't forget the live bands on the weekends. 

Check it out. You'll love it ... In a non-ironic way."}
{"text":"This place makes for a really fun night.  The bowling alley part is super retro, fun, and cheap.   While the food is simple, it is really good.  Best fried chicken ever!  This probably isn't the type of place where you want to go to master bowling but it makes for a great night of drinks, food, and trying not to throw gutterballs."}
{"text":"Came here with some coworkers for a fun night.  We had a blast. It was fun to learn how to score your own game.  We got some food as well.  Nothing beats burgers and a large basket of fries."}
{"text":"My favorite, favorite bar in the Cleveland area. Awesome space, great service, lots of things to do, and the best drinks you will find. Tonight they had my very favorite drink in the whole wide world -- the Beatnick, with fresh beet juice, Buillet, maple syrup, and lemon. Always happy to come here."}
{"text":"Mediocre is the first thing that comes to mind visiting this place.  The fact that this place is in Lakewood is even more disturbing.  I can't believe such places still operate in such a competitive city.  Balls not marked, walls collapsing, no screens, no upkeep very very sad.  I hope this review helps somebody not make the mistake we made visiting it.  The best way to sum it all up is an overpriced dump."}
{"text":"So chill I love it. Old school bowling, beer, live music, board game room with couches, bar, a few snacks. This is the perfect date place on a weekend."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out, Did the doctor who party there and it was pretty amazing :)"}
{"text":"Old school lanes, lots of resets and weak ball return delays the bowling flow. Like the fact of paper scoring with pens!? Hope they never get the overheads. Too dark though, need to jazz it up, felt like we broke into a closed alley and 2 lanes were somehow (kind of) working. Decent food, service, dirty but clean, nostalgic for sure. 50/50 on returning - may try some others first. More lights please."}
{"text":"fried chicken is the best ive ever had..drinks were a little pricey but service and quality were on point.."}
{"text":"Combine the chic and the shabby here with probably the BEST fried chicken I've had in years! The \"original\" walls show artwork from days gone by and friendly? You can't beat the owners for friendliness...Chopped salad is to die for as well...hmmm then, there is the curry popcorn...WE didn't EVEN get to the bowling we were having so much fun!"}
{"text":"This place is so cool!  Feels like you're back in the 70s with the vintage bowling alley and keeping score with just a paper and pencil!  It's also a music venue and restaurant/bar.  Crowd is super chill and you don't have to be 21 to get into. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times to watch my son's band play. I feel very old while listening to the show and moving out of the way of the mosh-pit people but it's a cool venue. Parking lot across the street."}
{"text":"Fun place to go. Not a big selection of balls under 10lbs (as in, I didn't see one). Lanes ran smooth and the price is fair."}
{"text":"I live in Austin, TX, where they know how to party, and this is seriously the best place I've been in a long time. It sucks you have to keep your own score, download the app \"My Bowling Scorecard\", it easily keeps score for multiple people and it's free, but this is the only place I've been to across multiple major cities that didn't try to kick us out when we were the only people there. This is genuinely the best experience I've had in a long time and I've lived in five different major cities the past five years. If you're trying to find a place to go past 11pm within a 20 mile radius of Cleveland, this is the place to go. 

If it helps, I never leave reviews on Yelp even when I really hate a place cause I always forget or get busy, but this was easily worth the effort. If you think my review is too positive, you either don't know how to party or you haven't been to this place. Best experience I've had in such a long time"}
{"text":"Until yesterday, I didn't believe in love at first sight. But because I got drinks and saw a sweet rock show here within walking distance of my apartment, I NOW BELIEVE. Seriously, this place is fucking righteous, and I plan to come here way more often. It's a seriously odd pairing of old-school bowling alley and hipster rock joint that simply and incredibly works. Do yourself a favor and go see a show here, any show. They have multiple bands on most nights, and the odds are you'll find a new favorite."}

{"text":"Really cute vintage bowling alley with really nice staff. It took a while to learn how to score your own game, but it added to the fun. The food is great too!"}
{"text":"What an enjoyable romp we had at the Lakewood neighborhood stable of Mahall's. We hosted what was the first 1920's themed professional wrestling/speakeasy event last summer with great success. 

The entire staff was incredibly helpful and lending a hand at the drop of a wooden nickel. We can not wait to return and host another fun-filled event alongside them. 

With bowling, live entertainment, bar (don't tell the bureau of prohibition though), and a full menu of delicious fare, Mahall's is the most swinging spot in Lakewood. 

Huzzah!"}
{"text":"The perfect mix of retro and rundown, hipster and hip replacement. God I love it. 

Show up too early any day, and you run the risk of fighting off children's birthday parties and the elderly bowling league. Wait until later in the evening, when the live music starts and the hipsters break out their personal bowling shoes and the bar explodes with people. It's incredible and fun.

The food and drink prices are a little high--$8-$9 for tiny cocktails or hard cider--but you don't go there for a deal. You go there because it's awesome, and you don't mind your bowling ball getting stuck 4 out of 5 times down the lane."}
{"text":"I love this place!! I don't understand the whole hipster thing, and I wouldn't know it if it hit me in the head, but if a hipster is a harmless nerd in bad clothing, passé tattoos all over their bodies (males and females), and bad posture, then yes, I suppose some if the clientele are hipsters, but they're harmless. Get a grip, people. They aren't Walkers, they aren't going to eat your brains out. Ok, now that we got the hipsters out if the way...
This is a fun, barebones retro bowling alley. It's fun to get a pitcher of beer and play a few games. And using paper to keep score is fun. It puts my elementary school arithmetic skills to good use.
This is also a great place to have a party fur kids. You can decorate and bring in your own food and whenever I see little munchkins having a party there, they seem to be having a blast.
The bar drinks and food offerings are nothing to write home about, but it's nice to have that option available. I prefer to buy a pitcher of beer to share while bowling and then head across the avenue to Taco Tontos afterwards to eat.
Mahalls also hosts a lot if great events; keep your eye out for these."}
{"text":"The vintage lanes are fun...especially figuring out how to score your game if you're not familiar with doing that  because there aren't electronic score on the lanes :-)

FYI: The place is under new ownership this year and they got rid of the dart boards and pool tables that were previously in there. So if you're only going there to bowl, its fine."}
{"text":"Mahall's is one of a kind.   The old school feel of this place is absolutely fabulous.  We visited about six months ago and everyone in our group enjoyed every minute of the experience.  The fried chicken here is amazing so make sure to grab some.  The bar and concert area get really full but don't let that keep you from going if bowling is in your plans. There was a concert the night we were there and only had to wait about 45 minutes for a lane.  We were able to get drinks within 10 minutes of ordering at the bar.  Our food was delivered in a timely fashion and the service was great.  You have to go and experience this place for yourself."}
{"text":"Came tonight, a monday night. My wife needed to get the anniversary of the 5 years death of her mom off her mind. A friend said \"Take her bowling\" We havent been in 20 years easily. It was great. The owners were super friendly. Found plenty of balls that fit my fingers and my injured shoulder. The lanes worked perfectly, They were also well maintained and perfectly oiled. The shoes were in great shape. Drinks were 4 dollars each. All in all we laughed. My wife played so bad I offered we should just give her checkmarks instead of scores. I was throwing crazy strikes and I never broke 100 before. I loved it. We will be back for sure. When we left after all the laughing and having fun she said \"We need to do THIS more often\" So i guess we are bowlers now. ;) Thanks Mahalls."}
{"text":"Hands down, this is the coolest bowling alley I have ever been to. Sorry Lincoln Square Lanes in Chicago. I love ya, but you don't have Great Lakes Christmas Ale on tap! Super friendly customer service. Good beer selection. This place is cool as heck because it is vintage, not striving to be some vintage throwback bowling alley. I actually got a strike here! I think luck lives in this old place. I hear the food here is good as well. Will be back here the next time I go back to Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Despite a deep affection for the place, my husband and I had long neglected Mahall's since moving from the nearby west side of Cleveland. Once upon a time, we could be found awkwardly trying to keep score (never really mastered that) while bowling there quite frequently. We moved, and our bowling balls and shoes -- yep, we're dorky enough to have those too -- started gathering dust.

That's a long way of saying that it's been too long since we were at Mahall's. It was great then, and even better now. I love the wonky, well-loved and nicely maintained vintage lanes. Those haven't changed. 

The rest of the place? That's changed for the better. Mahall's has gone a bit upmarket, renovating its bar, adding a music venue, and developing a kitchen that knows what they're doing. A mushroom burger featuring a deep-fried portabella cap was a great twist. Their fried chicken is close to perfect, albeit a bit greasy. Veggie tacos were solid. The menu is small and straightforward. We'll be back with our shoes and bowling balls to try some more."}
{"text":"When I first walked in, I thought the place was weird and I wasn't going to like it. There was just an odd crowd there, but they were there for the band that was playing. We were there for the bowling, which is an old alley, but that's what gives it its charm. There weren't that many people there, just a few of the other lanes were taken, but that was okay with me. It was fun, and while we were bowling my boyfriend would run down to the bar and got us drinks--and then the tacos. Oh wow the tacos. They were $3 each, which I thought was a little pricey for a beef taco, but it actually had flavor to it. I feel like a lot of places, like Merry Arts, don't add any seasoning to their tacos. It's just ground beef in a shell. Not this place! These were some of the best  tacos I've had in a loooooong time. By the time we left, around 8 or 9, there were more bowlers and the bar area was pretty packed. The bar area looks like it is part of a completely different restaurant--very nicely decorated, a more intimate atmosphere. If you know how to keep score in bowling and like tacos, this is a good place to go."}
{"text":"We had a lot of fun here on a Saturday afternoon. We were the only people bowling downstairs (suits us fine). The cashier laughed at my jokes. The lanes seem a little beat up, but at $3 a game who cares."}
{"text":"Very cool scene in Lakewood.  Old school bowling where you score yourself, neat vintage-looking bar and food ordering area.  Bowling lanes and balls weren't in top condition, so if you are a competitive bowler, maybe not the lanes for you.  If you're just looking for a different scene for hanging with friends, it's a great choice.  We opted to pay by the hour, $20 per lane, which was a very reasonable price.

Bonus - if you are looking for a full night event, you can bowl and then see live music all in the same building.  Extra cover charge for music but it's small $."}
{"text":"Being born and raised in Lakewood, I've been to Mahall's many times throughout the years. Its always been near and dear to my heart. But even as a little one, I realized this place needed a pick-me-up. So they finally did it. And I'm so glad they kept the charisma of the place and didn't just completely redo everything so it looks like a run of the mill, everyday bowling alley. Nope! They cleaned it up, threw in some classic cocktails, decent food, and great events (like the Crafty Mart and Manly Mart!), oh and a stage to bring in musicians. The two bars are a nice touch too."}
{"text":"Cool place to hang out and grab a bite to eat! The meatloaf sandwich is good and you can bowl! Live music nice atmosphere! I will be back its get a 4 star!"}
{"text":"This was the first time at this bowling alley and I really enjoyed it! I was not expecting it to be set up the way it was. The lanes were retro and there were no tvs to re play you bowling but I preferred it this way. I really liked how there were lanes up stairs and downstairs. They make it convient to host any parties you want because its mostly closed off and private which is awesome. I loved the old style of it and the service was great. The whole entire staff was very friendly, especially when you needed a shoe size or needed someone to fix your lane they were right there.

I tried a couple of different types of food and everything I had was delicious. They make their own beef jerky and I could not stop ordering more. Also, I tried this beef taco meal that they made and it was the best I've had in a long time. 

Overall, the food was excellent and I had a lot of fun bowling. The environment is just very relaxed and happy that it makes you have a great time. Even though my score might have not been the best, at the end of the night I had a great bowling experience!"}
{"text":"Mahall's is kinda weird to me. I remember it as a place where you had your sixth-grade birthday party, but now it's a hipster paradise. 

Mahall's is one of my favorite places to hit up a show because if it isn't quite your thing, your evening isn't a bust. The good ol' fashioned bowling alley is pretty affordable for a few rounds. Even gutter ball bowlers like me have a great time. 

The bar area is nice, nothing to write home about. The staff has always been super friendly with great service."}
{"text":"I typically don't \"do\" brunch, because mashing two meals together means I get less meals to enjoy, but nobody does brunch as well as Mahall's. Good food, good bowling, good job Mahall's."}
{"text":"Original. Incredible.  What's more to say?   This place is a yesteryear throw back of awesomeness."}
{"text":"A very hip place for the youngsters. 21-30's crowd. 
Retro cool. I would've like a more decorative joint. Looks like some bar in Mexico, right now. Or like they are still fixing it up. Bombish.
We had drinks and ordered food.
Could use some better tap beers.  More choices. And maybe an el'cheapo one
like Black Label or Genesee.  Would make you  cooler, dudes.
Assorted bottle beers, fine selection. But expensive. The beer we liked
they didn't have cold in the cooler. You guys need a leader. 

Food-wise - nice menu choices. However, 3 pieces of chicken and a smaaaall piece
of cornbread is NOT a meal - OK?  A meal is chicken, a vegetable and a starch.
But, the chicken was fresh, hot and oooh so good. Get it anyway!
Also had a soft pretzel, since I was still starving after the chicken.  Very good and
super fresh. Served hot with mustard. Liked it. 
Service - could have been more attentive to folks coming in and sitting down.  And waiting for refills."}
{"text":"My prior review said this is where The Dude would hang out. That was before the renovation of Mahall's. That is also before I added a few more bars to my boycott list. I have been enjoying the new Mahall's and love the renovations. They peeled away paint and left some walls partially unfinished. There is some really cool artwork that they uncovered. The $3 Dale's Pale Ale keeps me coming back. The staff is great and service always comes with smiles. The vegan taco is outstanding."}
{"text":"I would suggest dont visit here.....not a happening place at all.....it is an old school bowling center......all things you have to do is by yourself......pls dont visit seriously"}
{"text":"Mahall's is a pretty big space. I've been before for a concert, which was held in a standing only venue off to the left of the main entrance. 

More recently I went bowling. There were 10 lanes upstairs. They were nicely spaced and the place wasn't crowded for a Friday evening around 6p. 

You pay per hour, not per game, and also for the shoes. The only con, or perhaps the fun of it all, is that you have to keep your own score. That means paper and pencil and a lot of mental math - or you can download a score keeping app onto your phone. One positive point is that this allows everyone to take some practice bowls, since the computer doesn't start keeping track from the first roll.  

Drinks available from the large bar behind the lanes. All in all not a bad way to spend the evening. Not as flashy as some of the newly built lanes, but there is nothing wrong with this space. Having a quieter atmosphere was actually enjoyable."}
{"text":"I've never really eaten there since the new ownership, I Will be honest. I'm writing my review solely on the Bar portion of this establishment.

I went in on a Friday and there were what seemed to be teeny boppers running around everywhere to hear their \"favorite band ever\" playing music. That part for any adult would normally be a turn off but Mahalls did a good job placing the stage on opposite side of building from the bar and bowling. 

I'm a 'normal upper 20 something lady. I was dressed in jeans and an Express sweater with a shaw over and as soon as I walked into the bar I stood out. Hipsters everywhere! I love hipsters that accept others for their own views and beliefs and the ones that don't...well they make things uncomfortable even for those who don't judge them......like me. 

Bartender looked at me, Turned away, waited on 12 other people including the guy standing next to me whom walked up 15 minutes after me. That customer  laughed and said 'good luck getting service from him. U aren't hipster enough.'  Finally 17 minutes later....the bartender came up to me and just pointed at me, didn't ask what I wanted, just a point. It was an uncomfortable interaction as I didn't even get my whole order out of my mouth before he asked me with a crappy look if I had asked for absinthe. ...I was trying to ask for absolut! I hated the idea of even taking the drinks and paying for them, let alone tipping! But I did!

This place could be good if they were more accepting of people that are just looking to have a good night out, bowling and laughing with friends. 

It sucks that there aren't many other options for bowling around town. It Really bummed me out this weekend i wont lie. This place used to be a true gem! Disappointed :/"}
{"text":"Such a cool place ! Old school bowling , great beer selection and live music ..oh ..the fried chicken was awesome !"}
{"text":"This joint has done a real 180. It used to be the bowling alley from the movie Gummo, comparatively anyhow. It still has that old feel, the reused a pin rack and turned it into the light fixture above the bar. The staff was very cool, they have promotions jumping off big time. 

Im a fan of the beer selection. 3$ Dale Pale Ales, awesome. There was a woman me and PW  met a pretty eccentric woman, Kathy, she had the Ora of someone who just walked out of 1973. Shes probably well into her 50s and was really cool, a little out there, but an awesome lady. She was crackin everyone up. Downstairs was a 70s party. Im a vegetarian, so I wasnt really diggn it( if u know what I mean). It seems to draw in a pretty mellow crowd and will always have the memories of being a kid, sneaking change in the cigarette machine, snatching and running. MEMORIES!!

I think ill be a new customer here. Havnt had food yet, will update."}
{"text":"Mahall's is awesome. Love the vintage atmosphere, at night you can catch a great concert and grab a drink. We came in one day and there were about 1,000,000 kids at a birthday party bowling upstairs. They totally gave us the entire downstairs to ourselves without us even having to ask! As mentioned if you are a serious bowler, you may not want to practice your skills here. You will have a bit older, worn lane and have to reset the pins yourself and keep score. But if you are going for fun like we do its always an amazing time!"}
{"text":"You can tell this place has been around for a long time but the people are friendly, the place is clean and the prices are great.  Kinda felt like I traveled back in time for a bit but had a great time!"}
{"text":"I love Mahall's! The staff is very friendly and I love the atmosphere. A little divey, but that's what gives it its charm. They're in the middle of a renovation so we'll see what happens. They don't have automatic scoring though so make sure you actually know how to keep score. Even if you don't, don't worry, there's an app for that :)"}
{"text":"I've been to Mahall's a couple of times since it's renewal.  

It has a great bar with remnants of walls past surrounding you.  The bartenders are quick and responsive and can make a mean cocktail!

In addition there is a downstairs bar that often has specials if you look it up on twitter!  

The lanes are the same, but the vibe has changed.  Changed for the better!!"}
