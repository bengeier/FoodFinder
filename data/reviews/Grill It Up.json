{"text":"Absolutely disgusting! Don't order the Persian grill, it is not comparable to real Persian kabobs. The meat is just flavoured junk, not real meat! If you really want to try it order something that's not ground up so you can actually see the meat!"}
{"text":"This is in my opinion the best place to eat at in the Fairview Mall food court. The menu at Grill It up is half Persian/Afghan half 'international' if that makes any sense. The main choices are the boneless chicken and the Persian kabab, which consists of one ground beef skewer and one ground chicken skewer. However there are also options like salmon, chicken with bone, and lamb. There are 2 choices of rice; basmati or veggie. The basmati is delicious, as are the roasted potatoes. Other side options include pasta, mashed potatoes, corn, chick peas, veggies, salad. Staff is friendly"}
{"text":"Ordered a mango juice with my food they gave some random mango pop which tasted rotten. When I went back to ask for an exchange they were very rude about it and refused to either give a refund or exchange the drink.  I am extremely annoyed and will never go back here."}
{"text":"What a scam. Their Persian kabob is just processed junk.  And they counted hot sauce as one of their sides. Skip \"Grill It Up\" at Fairview Mall, what a bunch of cheapskates."}
{"text":"I ordered a vegetarian plate and they gave me chickpeas cooked in bone broth!   I will never ever go back."}
{"text":"For a food court place, this place is decent. It can't compare with a real Iranian kebob place of course.  I had the beef and chicken kebob with 3 sides. As expected, it lacks the smokiness I expect from an Iranian place that uses charcoal. Still tastes pretty good. I prefer this kind of food over other choices in this food court.   They have other food choices like BBQ chicken and souvlaki. Will try.   Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Ordered the Seafood (Salmon) meal that comes with 3 sides.  The food's okay and we've been here a few times.  This time around, my beef with the place is they tell us they don't accept our Fairview Cadillac gift card (we were hoping to use the rest of the balance in our card).  We paid by credit card but found out on the Fairview Cadillac site that we could use or card.  A bit upset because they were dishonest.  I still don't know why they wouldn't accept gift cards... It's still money.  Food - 3 Stars Experience - 1 Star  Will be visiting Jimmy the Greek instead of this place."}
