{"text":"Stopped in to have one of their \"famous' hot dogs. The outside is very cute because it's shaped like a dog house and has drawings of two hound dogs. Cute, right? The menu looked promising. There was a whole section devoted to hot dogs, but I noticed that there is an extra charge if you order a hot dog with mustard and chopped onions. What? Usually hot dog garnishments are included. I ordered a plain hot dog and asked for mustard. It was a regular hot dog on a regular bun that wasn't even warm. Hot dogs from the grocery store taste far superior to the hot dog I got. The hot dog came with the mustard already applied and I was charged extra for the mustard! I ordered onion rings which were $3.50. I got six onion rings and they were all different sizes! I ordered a root beer and the glass wasn't filled all the way and there were no refills included. The \"cook\" came out of the back to deliver some food to the counter. She was wearing a dirty t-shirt that looked like it hadnt been washed in a month.She was a very pleasant lady though. All-in-all I paid $10 for food that left me feeling disappointed and hungry. Never again. Maybe the famous hot dogs are more of a memory. They need to reassess what they are doing there. It could be a great little place. Too bad."}
{"text":"I've eaten there a half dozen times, or so, and have ordered take-out just as many. It's a great LITTLE place with friendly people running it.    Basically, it's what you expect to find inside, after seeing the outside. It's clean, it's slightly cluttered, and it's been weathered by time. (Wouldn't change a thing.)   The prices are cheap and the food is tasty. (Which is prepared by 2-3 ornery women, which have to deal with the even more ornery regulars, but still make it a point to put good food on the plate.) -If not just to keep us shoveling food in our face and our mouths shut. (You know what I mean.)   The seating is bar-style with around twelve round, slightly-padded stools. And, in most mornings, you can't find a vacant seat in the house.    They also have a nearly decipherable 14\"  tv hung in one corner, with something truly life-altering airing, for your viewing enjoyment while you wait the five minutes, or so, for your food preparation.   Can't beat the parking though. (Given it's location.)   Bottom line is that I love the joint, and I feel late to the party for all the times I had driven-by without stopping in for a bite. (Try the Ashlee Burrito.)-Breakfast.      It's awesome."}
{"text":"Food is over priced. Not bad food for a hot dog diner place.Make sure you use restroom before you go as they have no public restrooms.    it's a novelty just to say you went."}
{"text":"This is a small place with occupancy for about 15.  But the breakfast is very good.  Typical diner menu.  I haven't eaten lunch there yet, so I cannot comment yet."}
{"text":"My cousin bought lunch here for everyone.  He did takeout and ordered 5 burgers, and 3 fries.  The fries were only so/so, overall only 1 was probably eaten.  But the burgers where wonderful.  He got them with tomato, onion and mushrooms.  I hate mushrooms with a passion, but this burger was so good, I didn't even notice eating them.  I haven't been here since the late 80's, but I plan on going back here soon."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped at this little spot for the first time after having lived here for the past two years. This place was established in 1952: and looks the part. The conversation and food however, was 100% worth it and was delicious! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for outstanding service don't bother. Charlie's is a dive diner literally located in the corner of a parking lot. The building is small, seats 10-15 tops, please dont sneeze the place might collapse.  The regulars have their seats there. My first visit there I apparently sat in one of those seats. Prior to even getting a cup of coffee the cook came out and told me to stand up. I did, she then took the seat off the post. I wasn't going to argue, she was a beast and could probably kick my ass.  The food is good diner food and its cheap. Just ask permission before you sit down."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful burger here on my lunch break. The staff were all very friendly and the burger was really really good - I tried a special with smoked cheddar and bacon... YUM. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"Breakfast is really great.  Everything is made to order.  The food is hot, well-seasoned, and absolute perfection.  The Ashlee Burrito is the best! Everything I've ever ordered is great."}
{"text":"It's been said and it's worth saying again, they have no bathroom, none and you can't wash your hands either.  This was a disaster when I brought my young kids there.    After waiting 30 minutes for 2 dogs and fries the food finally came.  It was not very good at all.  Worst fries too. Then my 4 yr old says he has to go, so I ask where the bathroom is, but they have none!    We left immediately, but paid $18 for a kids meal, 1 dog and 2 sides!  Amazing.  At least the staff was nice, but totally inept."}
{"text":"Your typical greasy spoon. For a man with a hangover that could have killed a large elephant this past Sunday, this random tiny diner hit the spot. I'm of the mind that you can't fault a place for not being anything it doesn't pretend to be. Want hot coffee? Want tasty breakfast grub? Don't want to drive far (if friends live in the area and you didn't want to get a DUI the previous evening and slept on their ancient couch)? Then eat here. There's a Dollar Store right next door, so you can even make an extremely inexpensive date out of it...you know, if she's that kind of girl."}
{"text":"Great little breakfast spot.  Glad they dont smoke indoors...it used to be awful.  Good, cheap breakfast practically made right in front of ya.  They have Keno too!  My booze..just sodas and water, etc."}
{"text":"Just a greasy spoon diner with a good fashioned breakfast. There are no tables you just belly up to the bar. We have been hitting up Charlie's for a few years now. It's a great place to go after a night out and I guarantee your bill will not be over $10- unless you purchase some scratch offs. Fantastic food, the staff is great, and you always see some interesting people. The Ashlee burrito is amazing. (A breakfast burrito topped with sausage gravy)."}
{"text":"Stopped because they have a sign that says Chicago Style Hot Dogs. Not sure if they've ever been to Chicago or seen/had a true Chicago Style Dog? Poor attempt and nowhere close to what you'd expect. Bad bun, no poopy seeds. Plain relish, not the neon used. No sport peppers, they used jalape√±os!!! Another miss here in Cleveland for a authentic Chicago Style Dog. My hunt will continue..."}
{"text":"Charlie's Restaurant is a time machine back to when small and weird places reigned supreme. There are two large wooden dog cut outs by the former take out window beckoning travelers to stop in. Charlie's sits on the corner of the Brookview Shopping Center parking lot. There are plenty of lottery tickets to play while waiting for food. There are 4 separate signs telling players that the scratched off silver shavings should not be left on the floor. They serve hot dogs, hamburgers and breakfast food. Charlie's is a great place to dine. The food is cheap and the experience is classic Cleveland."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my meal at Charlie's, and I think I can explain the way the Yelp reviews careen between 1's and 5's.   This place is OLD and old-style. It opened in 1952 but might as well be from the 1930s. It's teeny (just a counter and about a dozen stools), the menu is old-school (burgers, hot dogs, breakfast anytime), the food is all cooked to order, and the service is very friendly (the waitress calls you hon) . The down side of that is it's teeny (no restroom) the menu is old-style (no salads), it takes a while to get your food, and the waitress really slings the hash.   Your impression will be decided by what you honestly like and enjoy. If what you like (be honest now!) is swanky leasehold improvements and a waiter who crouches down to introduce talk about the chef's philosophy of locally sourced ingredients, walk you through the menu, and keeps checking if everything is done to your liking this is probably not the place for you.   If what you enjoy is a trip back in time, an almost antiquated menu and cooking methods (i.e., no delivered pillows of soup, or dozens of burgers sizzling on the grill waiting to be ordered), and a waitress who addresses you with a genuine human warmth, you'll love it.   I love hot dogs. I love places that are comfortably integrated in countless ways. I hate putting on airs. I loved the totally original decor. Was it the best, cheapest, most wonderful food ever? No. But it was a heck of a lot of fun. It reminded me of places I went with my dad 50 years ago or more.   (I would say it's not good for large groups as about 95 percent of the seating is counter stools.)"}
{"text":"Great food! Very friendly hospitable service.  Call ahead to avoid a wait and it'll be worth it.  Very good cornbeef hash."}
