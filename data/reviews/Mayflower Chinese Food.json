{"text":"Horrible service good took over 2 hours to get delivered."}
{"text":"The hunt for really good (Westernized) Chinese food continues. Like many other places in the area (Weston/Mt.Dennis), Mayflower is a solid \"meh\"; a 2.5 out of 5. Nothing horrible but nothing great either. Ordering was a breeze and delivery arrived within the hour as promised. Lots of greasy heavily-battered food available but not much in the way of flavours. 

If some greasy grub would really hit the spot, by all means order from this place! But if you're looking for something a little better than mediocre Soo Guy and dry BBQ pork, you'd likely be happier going elsewhere."}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese food in all of Toronto. I love the rice and noodles."}
{"text":"This place has pretty decent westernized generic Chinese food when you are in the mood for that.  Service and wait times can be spotty and inconsistent. 

Made a pick up order... showed up on time and told to come back 20 minutes later.  Come back 20 minutes later and told to come back 10 minutes later.

Finally get my order and it's someone else's order... they are lucky I noticed it and came back or someone else would have been hungry too.

Finally got the correct order after waiting for another 25 minutes.  So in total... that's 45 minutes late.

Been ordering for over 10 years but I'm done with Mayflower from now on.  Throwing out their flyers and going to look for somewhere else to order from.  I can't count on their inconsistent service anymore.

The girl who gives me the order says sorry and I told her I was not ever ordering again and she smiled and said sorry I don't know what to say... blame the cooks.... nice

Order at your own risk."}
{"text":"I am extremely disappointed with this place. Their large entrees that cost 10.50 don't come with any rice or anything on the side. And the large can be considered a small. 

I ordered the shrimp and garlic which had no flavor at all. I had to order a side of some sort for a separate barge. They didn't have brown rice and I ended up getting mushroom chowmain which was cooked with no effort. It was practically raw. 

Very very overpriced! $40 for Chinese food should go a long way. However all I had was two entrees and lo mein. 
I wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"I first heard about this place while reading an article about Rob Ford and that this was his favourite takeout Chinese food place. Now I don't always agree with everything that Robbie does but he's a fatty like me so I tried it out and it's really good. The chicken balls were a tad greasy but they had big chunks of chicken in them and not too much dough either. The spring rolls were excellent and the wonton soup was also excellent, full of wontons and quite filling on its own. I highly recommend this place if you are looking for good Canadian style Chinese food at a decent price."}
{"text":"I haven't had great Chinese Canadian fast food in a while. Moving down South I've had trouble finding something I like. Toronto definitely has amazing spots but in Etobicoke this definitely a great spot. Food is amazing and time for pick up order is very reasonable ( around 20 min).

If you're looking for Chinese takeout in Etobicoke this is definitely the spot. Buffets are okay if you want AYCE but this place does not compare, plain and simple the food is just really good."}
{"text":"I eat at Mayflower often. More than often. I'm there once a week usually. Sometimes more. I've had a lot of what they offer, and I can say without a doubt that it's my favorite Chinese restaurant in Toronto. I enjoy it so much that I rarely eat at any other Chinese restaurants. I usually get one of the combo items listed on the menu board in the restaurant. The place can get insanely busy with long waits but I've never been disappointed. If you want to order on New Year's Eve, you have to call it in on December 30. The best Chinese in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Great comfort Chinese food. I recommend the chicken balls and reheating the leftovers with sesame oil!"}
{"text":"After all of the reviews and praise that I had heard about this place (including Mayor Ford's blessing) I was extremely disappointed with everything about this place.

I was surprised that it was very much like a small laundromat when you enter. A ring of waiting charis surrounding an order desk. That's it! The young girl that took our order made a mistake with the prices and had to re-enter my debit card twice and we were given NO utensils nor napkins whasoever. This was upsetting since I had to run all the way back to get some from a nearby park.

When I finally got some food in my mouth, it tasted just like heat-lamp buffet chinese food, overly steamed and soggy.

Sorry Mayflower, my ship has sailed elsewhere."}
{"text":"Anyone who cuts up the place needs to stick to the buffets. Always tastes fresh and is extremely flavorful. Several times over repeat customer and will continue to order."}
{"text":"I drove 45mins because i had a craving for chicken balls and this place did not disappoint!! Best chicken balls ive ever had!! I definitely will be back!!"}
{"text":"Good take out Chinese , Shanghai noodles , chicken soo guy , beef broccoli . Nothing but good classic Chinese . Delivery and pick up during weekend can be over 1hr ."}
{"text":"Great, honestly this place is amazing, its been here for over 40 years
The Cantonese Chow mein is so addicting, the beef in any freaking dish is super super tender. The sweet and sour sauce is better than any other restaurants'. The chicken is always white meat with zero fat. It can get really busy on weekends so be prepared for a wait time! Staff is usually really friendly when you have questions. There is always this one older asian teenager who's nice and knows exactly what shes doing.
Tips: Sometimes long wait time, Ask for cutlery if you need them because most customers order large and take it home to eat from what I've seen"}
{"text":"It was fine. The place itself is small and boring. And it wasn't cheap. And I asked for veg spring roll they gave me some weird meat"}
{"text":"Please tell Calvin Mayflower still has the best Chinese food in town including the GTA!   Katie says she likes EVERYTHING  Calvin makes. Nick says he has the best sweet and sour chicken balls and William says he loves the shrimps. They're the best!  Thanks for a wonderful dinner!"}
{"text":"Great food...cooked to perfection...don't wait for delivery...pick up yourself.
This place is very busy...don't expect to receive your order in 15 min or less...they're not making pizzas?

Snow flowers want everything when they think of it...instant gratification!

However if you figure out the time to order the reward is worth it..."}
{"text":"This place has been around for over 40 years and there is an excellent reason for this.  The food is great, for westernized chinese food, and have a few authentic dishes as well.  I worked downtown for many years and know the difference between real and western chinese food, but if you are going for the western style, this is one of the best in the city.  High quality food and after ordering from them for decades, have yet to have a dish that didn't taste great or was cooked properly.  So you are well aware, this is a take-out/delivery business, there are no tables to eat here.  They are always busy and the food is cooked to order, so if you want a place where you can get it fast by choosing food under heat lamps and be in and out is under 10 minutes, don't go here.  If you want fresh good food cooked to order, then this is the place for you.

The kitchen staff are all asian, using authentic cooking utensils (nothing frozen or prepared earlier to be heated up in a microwave) as you can hear and see through the beaded drape separating them from the order area, and they tend to employ local high school seniors to do the order taking out front.  these girls are very good at taking orders, including checking on specialty items while on the phone so there is no disappointing call backs, or food missing from your order.  Delivery is between a half hour to an hour depending on how busy they are, and they tell you the approximate time for delivery so you know up front. But despite this wait time, the food always arrives piping hot and ready to eat.  Don't forget to ask for utensils if you need them, they don't believe in unnecessary waste, this is Etobicoke after all.

Once again, there is a very good reason they have been in operation for over 40 years, and still highly popular and very busy for a reason, they are simply the best chinese take-out in west Toronto.  ENJOY!!!"}
{"text":"Perfect! 

Cheap and cheerful and everything I want in Chinese Delivery. 

Pros:
*Open late
*100% order accuracy
*Andrea who took our order, was kind, easy to understand and understood our questions (often hard to come by b/c of language barrier). Helpful suggestions and conscientious about our food sensitivities. 
*Good portion sizes
*Spring rolls were homemade and fresh (not crappy SuperStore frozen (*I* can buy those))
*Sweet & Sour Chix was fresh and hand breaded, not frozen

Cons:
*None!"}
{"text":"Believe the hype! This is very good Chinese food. Quality. Quantity. Value. And good customer service from the very efficient staff that are running this small but popular place. Egg rolls are excellent. Ribs too. And surprisingly enough, you really must try their chicken balls."}
{"text":"A family favourite for sure! Hits the \"I'm in the mood for Chinese\" perfectly. Great quality, quantity and service.  My only complaint is so minor it really shouldn't lose a star or be taken seriously, but having a better selection under combos would be nice as they have SO much selection I think I spend more time over reading the menu than inhaling their food.  Definitely making this our regular Chinese fix."}
{"text":"My fam orders from Mayflower all the time. 

Shanghai noodles, chicken fried rice and beef with broccoli are always on point. I decided to branch out and try a couple of other Chinese restaurants in the area (for delivery) but they didn't even come close to Mayflower. This place is the real deal I promise ya.

Really great, long-running, local business that has earned my loyalty and support!"}
{"text":"Your typical chinese takeout joint.  Opens after 4pm.  Meals available for singles."}
{"text":"I am not huge fan of chienese food but this place is ppretty good for American styyle Chinese food. I usually get a combo 1 chicken friend rice with chicken balls and their wings are pretty good too."}
{"text":"My family and I have been ordering from them for years, and we've never had a problem with them. My personal favourite is their Schezwan Shanghi noodles, spicy and delicious!"}
{"text":"Sometimes you really just want some good old fashioned westernized Chinese food. If this is you, Mayflower is your place. Hubby and I got takeout from here and it hit home on the classic greasy Chinese food we were looking for.

The honey garlic spare ribs were a tasty treat offering a good balance garlicy sweetness, the chicken lo mein was delicious (good balance between sauce, noodles, chicken and veggies), and the egg rolls were also done well with a not-too-thick crust. The star, though, was the chicken balls. Let's face it, if you're going for this type of Chinese food, it's that deep fried goodness dunked in the red sweet and sour sauce that you really want - and Mayflower gives you just that. There is a light sweetness to the batter complemented with a good chunk of meat. Will definitely be ordering this again. 

When you walk in, you can smell the goodness in the air. The pickup area is very simple and the waiting area is pretty small. The staff are straight forward and set your expectations early in terms of how long you will wait for your order."}
{"text":"Food is has normally been very tasty but service is terrible. We had a dozen people over and ordered a bunch of food, they told us an 1.5 hours,which seems a bit much but we waited, 2 hours later we called and were told that they hadn't yet started  our order, we cancelled then and went to a different place who had our order ready in 20 mins. I guess they don't care about their customers or making money on a substantial order. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"We did take out from here about a week ago. Their egg rolls and spring rolls are incredible and such a steal. We also had the sweet and sour chicken, beef chop suey, chicken vegetable stir fry and all were really good. We ordered in and had our food in about 45 min. Super fast and friendly service. Definitely my future go to place for Chinese food night in."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery for sweet and sour spare rib, chicken fried rice, and egg soup. The call taker was friendly and helpful. However, the order took more than 50 mins to be delivered...when I live in the vicinity of 5 min drive. I thought an accident took a toll on the time so when I asked the delivery man, I got a very rude and curt 'we're busy'. Shocked from uncalled hostility, I handed a bill and waited my change so that I could tip. Instead he short hands me by keeping a meager change, and authoritatively (and retorically) asks 'it's okay right?'. 

Inside the package, no tissue, fork, spoon, no utensil whatsoever to eat the food with. However, there were two soy sauce packs, two fortune cookies, and the food was descent for the price. 

Unfortunately, I will never order from this location again with its poor delivery experience that made me feel extremely guilty about asking why their food was delivered late, not to mention withholding from proper exchanges of money. 

If you want a well priced chinese food, so be it. However, be prepared for unapologetic lateness and confounding courage to keep change and storming out your frontsteps."}
{"text":"Literally inedible. We threw the food in the garbage. 
Go to Manchu wok and save a few bucks."}
