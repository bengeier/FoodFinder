{"text":"Big Fan of their Ribs, I was @ the AZ BBQ, tried a couple different ribs, but their's was the best. Awesome.   When it comes to BBQ, I can care less how the place looks, as long as the food is great cause my face will get messy....."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE! Walked in for Chicken on a Sat evening & they said they were \"out of chicken!\" Now people, what sense does that make on a Sat BUT still, gave them the benefit of the doubt since the gal said \"we had a rough day.\" Paid $25 for a small to go container of Ribs (5 1/2 pieces), Brisket  (8 small fatty slices) not cooked well & 2 peach cobbles (supposedly that was peach cobbler)! Both types of meat was NOT GOOD AT ALL! The peach cobbler was made like apple cobbler but with peaches but the flavoring was not good PERIOD even if it was apple cobbler! I have NO clue what the crust was on the peach cobbler. At first sight it kind of looked like an apple cobbler crust (kind of) or slightly a light colored graham cracker crust but the taste was something else that i cant even describe or make out what type of dessert it goes with, possibly that crust belongs to one of those tart cobbler. My husband and I were sooooo disappointed & disgusted. They say they're from Chicago...WHAAT..well that is truly a disappointment for Chicago and not a good look what so ever! We will NEVER eat there again!"}
{"text":"Amazing BBQ!  I've had most BBQ places around and this place is sooo good!  Just yesterday I ordered 6 pounds of meat for a bday party and they had it ready in no time. If you haven't eaten here...do it!"}
{"text":"Several empty tables when we walked in. We found one and waited for several minutes while the bartender and a couple of servers were engaged in conversation and laughter. When none of them waited on us nor even acknowledged us we got up to leave. At last they spoke, when one of them said, \"Bye, have a good night!\""}
{"text":"Had a great time at Tom's today. Delicious Italian Beef with giardinara. Goes great with an ice cold beer. Awesome staff, great food. Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and had the traditional pulled pork sandwich. It was super tender and delicious. Fast friendly service and awesome BBQ. I can't wait to try the other menu items."}
{"text":"We had not been to Tom's in awhile, but went for the Friday fish fry as it had always been very good on our previous visits. We didn't realize it had been sold, but could definitely tell a difference. The fish was ok, not nearly the same as it had been and their menu choices were more limited. Not sure what the new style will be like when they convert to the Louisiana BBQ, hopefully they do a better job with that."}
{"text":"I really like the Toms in Mesa, but this location just does not cut it. My family has tried this location four times. Not once have we not had a problem.IE  Chicago style beef was salty ( AKA it was days old and reheated) or did not give us what we ordered. Now I understand people can make mistakes, but I would have liked my order correct at least one in four times. I give the Toms in Mesa Five Stars. Just not this location in Chandler."}
{"text":"Second visit in two month. Tonight was Fried fish Friday's was nice and easy. Friendly service with a smile at a neighborhood bbq joint. This is the first bbq place we've tried within the area and it doesn't disappoint. Looking for other places to try."}
{"text":"The best BBQ I have had in a long time. I do a little grilling myself and let me tell you it was well worth the money. Billie is a wonderful woman and waitress, she made my day and smile, she treats you like family from the time you enter through the doors. I will definitely be back not just for the food but for the laughs and company of the staff. Very respectful and kind, I wouldn't have had this any other way. Please stop by and pick up or just sit and relax with some Chicago style BBQ and laughs."}
{"text":"Just went for the first time and I was really impressed for the most part. The wait staff was very pleasant and very helpful. Fiance and I shared the 3 meat combo. We chose rib tips, brisket, and chicken. It also came with 2 sides and I believe the cost for that was around $12.99. We chose 2 orders of fries for our sides and were disappointed with those. They were dark brown like they were sitting in the oil too long and they were also tastless. Next time we will get mashed potatoes instead. The chicken and brisket were delicious but I personally didn't like the rib tips because they tasted like rubber. All in all we will be back again sometime to give it another shot."}
{"text":"AWESOME food & great service!!!!! I travel extensively for work and have had BBQ throughout the US. Kansas City is good, Memphis is ok, the Carolinas are decent and Texas not my favorite. Tom's is easily on the top of my list. Get some!!!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing Italian beef and the staff is amazing. I had the curly fries and they were homemade. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Worse place ever! My husband pointed out the fact that you can't smell any food or barbeque smells outside. We still ordered food and it was not flavorful at all! We got the family pack with sausage, ribs, and brisket and I was very disappointed. My husband eats anything even if he doesn't like it and we ended up giving the rest to the dogs. Barbeque sauce at Frys grocery store was way better! I still don't understand how you mess up barbeque!! If your wanting barbeque go across the streets to Wal-Mart or Frys and pick up the already made barbeque in the deli sections."}
{"text":"Great service, price and quality! Hard to find real BBQ, this place is great!"}
{"text":"Simple store layout. Food was very good and portions were sizeable. Best cornbread I have ever had as was so moist."}
{"text":"If you are looking for authentic Chicago style food look no further. I am from Chicago and this is as good as it gets. To my knowledge there is no one doing BBQ, Chicago style beef and sausage any better this side of Chicago. Give it a try you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I have been here for lunch many times and always have had good food and good service.  The Chicago Italian beef sandwich is great along with the baked beans. The fish is also pretty good.  I would definitely recommend to give it a try."}
{"text":"Attention to detail in the kitchen. Curly fries are hand-peeled before frying, beef-steak sandwich is amazing. BBQ sauces and dishes are excellent, finally a hot BBQ sauce that's actually HOT!  So much goes into perfect BBQ, there is so much risk because of the time to prepare the meat. They pull it off here. Nothing's reheated."}
{"text":"In a big BBQ fan, and this place is pretty good.  I've gone with my family many times.    I recently tried the Tom's BBQ challenge, and that's been my only negative experience.  It's 3 house sandwiches, a plate of fries, and s plate of onion rings.  Ultimately, I failed.  However, the reason the experience was negative was because the house sandwich wasn't very good.  Staff was great, though."}
{"text":"I am really surprised that this place doesn't have a higher average ratings!  I discovered this place after an exhausting day of moving into the neighborhood.  I was greeted by the nicest lady, I believe her name was Billie... she gave me the story of the restaurant, and told me what items were good on the menu.  I got a little sampler, and while I was waiting, she brought me a little slab of ribs so I could taste them (they weren't in the sampler I ordered).  Needless to say, the food was fantastic - and reminded me of being back in the Midwest.  I go there from time to time and always have a great experience - whether I'm eating in or taking out."}
{"text":"There wasn't much in the phone in order that they got right. They forgot to give us buns with the family meal, they were out of corn bread so they replaced it with Mac and cheese, they gave us a small Mac and cheese instead of a large (although the kids didn't like the mac and cheese anyway), and they forgot to give us the large beans we ordered. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Saw the truck thought I'd give it a try!  Three pulled pork sandwiches, beans, & mac salad for $25+ ...  Pork was fair, bread had the texture of 'yesterdays' - mac salad (better at Basha's Deli - The beans were very tasty, swimming in a very smoky tasting yet very thin sauce..  The BBQ meals at the restaurants much better !!..  The young man was very friendly and courteous..  Sorry, but if I see the truck again, I'll pass by .."}
{"text":"Clean, good food and great service. BBQ food is probably a B but everything else put together makes it a great place to go."}
{"text":"This place is decent, but not excellent.  I had the brisket dinner plate, and it was more than enough brisket for me.  It came out just how I like it - moist and not TOO much fat but still enough to keep the flavor on track.  I had a side of mac-n-cheeze which had a very slight kick to it (jalapeno mac) and it was tasty, although a little on the \"not quite warm (temperature) enough.\"  Still good.  I also had the loaded fries I think they were called...  They were good, but I'll pass on those next time... A heart attack in a cardboard tray.  Speaking of cardboard trays...  This place is cafeteria-style (ish) which is fine, I enjoy that in a BBQ place, but their cheap plastic cutlery is pretty underwhelming.  It's a good thing the brisket were moist and tender, of the flimsy plastic knife would have gotten me nowhere.    I thought the food was a little on the spendy side, especially since it's not full service, but I've paid more for less.  The counter staff was very courteous and helpful in selecting my sides, and even came by a little later and asked if I liked them and if there's anything I thought they could do better.  Not that they would have, but it's the thought that counts.  :)  I'll probably hit this place for some of the lunch plates in the near future, since I did enjoy the food."}
{"text":"If your looking for traditional BBQ, this is not the place. Food came dry and the pulled pork tasted like it just came from a crock pot. When you ask for sauce, there is one kind and that is it. I am not complaining, just not my typical BBQ experience or what I prefer. If this is your type of BBQ, I am sure you will love it."}
{"text":"We took the whole family and had dinner.The staff will adjust their food preparation(if at all possible)for any reason at all. I had dental issues, and wanted the fish and chips,so. the kitchen staff fried everything soft for me. I would have my staff do that in my restaurant,but, not too many will. I was very grateful.They are so nice, and really know the meaning of customer service.The food is fast,plentiful and fantastic.We also loved the retro music!"}
{"text":"People look at neighborhoods with schools and public services... well I am from now on looking at neighborhoods with Tom' BBQ.   I'm from Wisconsin and still being close to Chicago, we get a lot of this style food. I was craving a place like back at home and noticed this place on Baseline. When you walk into the place it has that Chicago style smell and looks.   For the first few months I stuck with the ribs and pulled pork. They put a little cole slaw on the bottom of the pulled pork which makes it have a sweeter taste to it. Genius! Just recently though I have been getting either their ALL YOU CAN EAT FISH FRY, which they have everyday of the week. The fish is breaded perfectly. You might as well already order seconds when you place your order because you will be getting more. I'm not a big guy and my record is five orders in one sitting.  Overall, the only bad thing I would have to say about Tom's BBQ is no beer. I love sitting down and having some hearty food while drinking a cold beer, because nothing adds to the flavor of fish and BBQ than a cold Miller Lite.  Tom's BBQ is amazing and be careful because you will be craving it once you go there, which isn't a bad thing at all."}
{"text":"Ate a loaded potate and found the brisket to be well undercooked too tough to eat also not well cut. The barbecue sause was flavorless. also the price was more than it should be"}
{"text":"I stopped by a couple times before and got sausage sandwiches that were okay, but finally made a huge mistake and ordered a bbq chicken sandwich with bacon togo. I got back to work with my sandwich and not only was the chicken not fully cooked, but neither was the bacon. I called to let them know, and told them I could not come back because that I had used all my time for lunch already, and was told he would leave a note under the register and take care of me next time. Next time was the next day and they said they didn't know anything about a raw sandwich. These clowns do not know how to cook chicken in a way that won't kill somebody, and it makes me recommend you go anywhere but here."}
{"text":"I've got this weird diet where I'm basically vegetarian for 1/2 the year and very carnivorous for the other 1/2.  No rules, or specific dates...that's just how it's worked out for the last few years.  Anyway, when I'm eating meat, I like it to be of the best quality.  Tom's really didn't do it for me.  We ordered a Pulled Pork Sandwich and a Rib Tips meal along with fries and mashed potatoes.  The potatoes were either shipped in frozen or were made from a dehydrated mix.  The Rib Tips were overcooked and dry (possibly old).  The fries and the pulled pork sandwich were the highlights -- and the only things I'd order off the menu, if I ever went back.  I've had far better BBQ experiences at Honey Bear's and Famous Dave's.  The service at Tom's was good enough for a fast food place.  It wasn't spectacularly good or bad.  I don't think I'll be going back any time soon, though -- not when there are other better BBQ places so nearby and Someburro's is in the same shopping center."}
{"text":"To really taste good BBQ you need to get the sauce on the side. Franklin says if brisket is served smothered in sauce the pit master is trying to hide something. I ordered brisket and ribs with sauce on the side, brisket is hard to get right and these guys nailed it! Nailed the ribs also!  Mac and cheese was good but not over the top. Gonna be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"The other day, I accompanied a friend to Tom's BBQ Challenge .. ohmigod intense. 32 minutes to eat three sandwiches and two huge sides. (He didn't make it. Nobody has.) I'm def going back on my own sometime.   The service here is uh-mazing, the lady there joked around with us lots, gave us suggestions, and encouraged us all to stuff ourselves silly. She made a slight mistake with our order (pressing the wrong button), but it just meant she gave us more free food, so, um, it's all good here, bruddah.  Definitely a super casual and very fun place to go eat with friends. My suggestion: fried zucchini. MMM."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love Toms. We like to order the number one which is a sandwich combo. I will order the pulled pork which is very juicy. He orders the brisket. Their sides are very good as well.   In my opinion Tom's BBQ is better than other BBQ places. At toms the friend pickels are spears. The onion strings are delish. They include coleslaw on your sandwich at no extra cost. The staff has always been very nice and helpful.  Somedays when u go in you order at the window, pick a seat and they will bring out your food. Other times you have a seat, they bring you a menu and you order with the waitress. Soda fountains are in the restaurant so its not a big deal to get up and refill your drink if the waitress is busy. In fact its probably a good thing to work off some calories from all the delicious food."}
{"text":"Great BBQ! So much improved. The food is great and the service was impeccable. Cody was our server and he was excellent! We will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"This food sucks.  My husband got 1/4 chicken so thick with spice it looked black.  I got chicken breast that was like rubber and tasted like chemicals.   The mac and cheese was tasteless, the beans taste like canned, the portions are tiny.  The prices are outrageous for this poor quality.   I couldn't even eat it, had I ate it there I would have returned it and walked out.  We'll stick with the best BBQ in town...Bobby Q's nearby."}
{"text":"Toms? Not the Toms that once was. The prices for some reason are Way higher then the other Toms locations. The portions are smaller too. A rip off! I paid 45 dollars for a family meal that feeds maybe 2. The food is ok  but not worth the price .When this place re-opened i was excited . When i got home with the food i was agitated.I called to express my feelings and they had no care in the world about my bad experience..i was  told to call the gal who owns the place . Save your money and go some where else !"}
{"text":"Certainly some of the best bbq I have ever eaten! Juicy, fresh, absolutely made with love. You can tell the cook loves what he does. The hospitality is fantastic and it's a great environment for all bbq lovers out there to bring the kids and get lost in the flavors of Chicago style bbq. Tom's rocks!"}
{"text":"best barbecue I've had since chicago .the brisket is phenomenal, and sweet coleslaw the way it should  be"}
{"text":"Very salty and seemed as if it was prepared from a crockpot.  Never see any smoke come from the place - how do you BBQ in a strip mall?   Hmmm."}
{"text":"The only good thing in this place is the service. The ribs were bad. Old and not tasty at all! The sauce isn't bad. For sides I tried the mac and cheese the worst thing ever! The fries were normal."}
{"text":"The service was exceptional and the atmosphere was down home be sure to take advantage of the Friday night fish fry all you can eat I myself enjoyed the catfish."}
{"text":"Level of service has dropped considerablely sinceTom's have gone to order at the counter. Our order was incomplete and the food quality has gone down.The red beans in the red beans and rice were non existent. The meat was tough.Felt the owner was rude to other customers who complained about at the table next to us.We won't be back"}
{"text":"Excellent Pulled pork sandwich w/ coleslaw. Personally like the special seasoning on the fries. Can't wait to try more."}
{"text":"I grew up with BBQ, my favorite being well made brisket with spicy sauce. So each time I try a new BBQ spot, brisket is my first choice.  The brisket here at Tom's was just ok. It came well cooked, but was already drowned in regular sauce that wasn't anything fantastic. They have a decent spicy sauce, but pouring water over rain just makes things more wet.  The side of bread comes out of a package and the beans were just too smoked that getting the full flavor out isn't possible.  I'll go back to try the Italian sausage, but I'm not expecting a meal to wow me.  If you want some quick BBQ, and it was darn quick with friendly service, this place is great. Unfortunately, the main meal I was interested in was abyssal and not worth recommending for $15."}
{"text":"Tried. Toms tonight for first time. Italian sausage with peppers was very good. Great authentic italian flavor. Also tried the chicago dog. It. Was very tasty and the sport peppers were not too hot. Bbq beans were as good if not better than the. Ones I used to eat in SC. I will definately be back to try the italian beef sandwich and pulled pork.  They just opened this. Location so be a bit easy on them till the opening issues are worked out.....Nothing major."}
{"text":"Tom's is within walking distance of my apartment so I already love it for the location. A friend of mine brought me dinner from Tom's a few weeks ago and it was outstanding. I'm from the Midwest so I value my BBQ and know what's truly considered BBQ. Tom's did it right. I had a basic pulled pork sandwich and it breath-taking. Just soaked in tangy BBQ sauce and pork sliced so perfectly I wasn't upset when it fell outta the bun a bit. Topped with a hefty spponful of cole slaw the texture was just the right amount of creamy and crunchy that I licking my fingers after.  We also got a boat of fried pickles. Cut into spears not round ridges, I thought they were delightful. A country girl myself, I grew up frying things and Tom's did pickles justice. Even without ranch to dip."}
{"text":"Had the pulled pork sandwich or what I would call a ball of reheated mush.  Don't bother with Tom's if you crave some BBQ, you can find much better."}
{"text":"Discovered this place today because of its bright pink pig truck parked outside. I'd seen the truck around, and I'm a real fan of checking out food from moving vehicles, whether it's a taco truck in San Diego or a neon pink truck with a curly tail. My son and I got out of the drive-thru lane at Wendy's and ventured over. We found the truck empty, but the restaurant was right there, so we headed inside.  We both ordered the pulled pork sandwich with curly fries. And I must say, I've never had pulled pork melt in my mouth like that before. I'm a pretty good cook and slow roasted or smoked pulled pork is my specialty. But this was better than mine. It was delicious, the bun was soft, the curly fries were thin and tasty. I will definitely be back with the rest of the family! My son is still talking about how great it was."}
{"text":"Horrible excuse for bbq. Pure gristled brisket. Pulled pork tasted gross, old, and appeared to have been reheated after sitting in all of its own fat overnight. Ribs are flavorless, tough, and chewy. Sauce and sides are just as nasty. $40 for meat that should be fed to dogs. This place makes Famous Dave's taste like a fine restaurant. One and done. I want to give it zero stars."}
{"text":"Tom is the best man I've ever worked for     .  he treat's every one who works for him With alot of respect   he has the best family ever  God bless  Tom and Cheri    your both the  best. .that's why Tom's BBQ  is the best"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in Peoria for BBQ. Their meats are melt in your mouth! I love their baby back ribs, really moist and smoky! Their pulled pork is super flavorful and very moist, not dried out with lots of sauce like some other places. Had their brisket and it was really tender and smoky. This place is a real gem that should be getting more recognition than that other chain BBQ on the P83 area....give it a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We stopped in for the first time a couple of weeks ago and everything was great!  The staff was very friendly and attentive. The food was excellent...my son had the pulled pork and loved it..the salads are huge!!  The atmosphere was perfect for families.  They also have a full bar and lots of TV's so it would be a great place to watch some football too!  We will be going back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Hot fresh and delicious.  This is the place for some good bbq. I love this place."}
{"text":"If you're looking for some local BBQ Tom's is that place. The pulled pork is great the service was also good. Check it out!  Robert Pfeifer"}
{"text":"Best burger I've had in a long time, fries were perfectly cooked. I've also tried their pull pork sandwich which is pretty good as well. The staff there were friendly as well. Best bbq in this side of town!"}
{"text":"Love the manager, Brenda, so friendly and attentive. Great food, excellent beer prices. Love that they have live music now!!"}
{"text":"food was not worth returning for.  Their chicken dinner meal looked like sliced cafeteria chicken.  the only thing good about Tom bbq sandwich was the toasted bread.  The bbq pork looked like it came out of a blender.   Plates and silverware were Styrofoam and plastic.  The mac and cheese was and mashed potatoes and gravy was good."}
{"text":"Great Italian beef... Just like Al's in Chicago. Service was excellent. A must try  if in the area."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch to go order.  Ordered four sandwiches and some sides.  Bill came to $44.16.  Thought this was a little high for a BBQ joint.  The food was okay. However, when I was reviewing my bank transactions, I found that Tom's charged me $54.16! The order was a carry out so there was no tip. Appears that Tom's was not happy with this and added a $10.00 tip to the charges. Bad business...."}
{"text":"The ribs at Tom's BBQ left much to be desired. They tasted old and they were hard and dry. The BBQ sauce on the meat looked more like ketchup than a savory, simmering sauce. I was extremely disappointed at the quality. It is difficult to believe a restaurant would serve a customer inedible meat. It was thrown away. What a waste of money. The experience was a total bust!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a hot Sunday afternoon for a cold beer and a late lunch. Ordered the rib tip appetizers with hot BBQ sauce.  About all I can say is the beer was cold and their air conditioning works well. Rib tips weren't tips and were way too fatty and tough. Hot sauce was neither hot nor saucy. At least the fries were fresh and didn't taste of yesterday's oil.    Staff is friendly and courteous. Restaurant and restrooms are clean. Stop in for some cold AC and have a drink.  Don't stop in for the food."}
{"text":"The staff is really nice here. In addition to the #BBQ options here are plentiful. If you are looking for a place to take the family or a great date night, this is your place!"}
{"text":"Lol brisket steak and 30$ . yeah this guy doesn't know much about food. I had a great experience here my ribs were smokey and came right of the bone, beans were tasty and the fries were fresh and crispy. Would eat here again. My order came out fine. Did ask about the missing food and they said they had gotten complaints before but they corrected it now . guess it was just the opening of the business at first. Hope they stay for a while I love good bbq!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit and after hearing nothing but great things about Tom's BBQ, I realize why.  Wow, their great selection on the menu, the special requests they will create, fantastic  customer  service and their enthusiastic interaction with the guests creates a wonderfully unique dining experience.  Today they are taking orders to smoke Turkeys for Thanksgiving.  Who knew, I have to try this next year.   A new favorite spot."}
{"text":"I've never been to this location to eat in, but have catered many times through the years, so take this as a catering review for this store. Excellent! Excellent! Excellent! If you're having a party or just entertaining a big family, you won't go wrong. Prices are fair. Quality and taste are always top notch."}
{"text":"Many other places to choose from. I will be in no big hurry to get back. Maybe I caught them on a bad day. Average BBQ"}
{"text":"The best flipping bbq I've ever had ! Especially like the pulled pork and chicken. We will definitely be back!!!!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, but I have to join the growing chorus of \"meh.\"  The rib tips were a bit on the tough side; the brisket had little going in the way of flavor; and most disappointingly, the hot bbq sauce was not particularly spicy.    It was not a bad place at all, just nothing special.  The service was very good, for what that's worth--very friendly and my food showed up in like fifteen seconds."}
{"text":"I'm a vegetarian. Or so I was until I met Tom and his Pig Rig.  No, seriously. For the past two years I've not had a speck of animal product in my diet. In a moment of weakness, my friend offered me a bite of her pulled pork sandwich. Having not eaten all day, I obliged.   It was the best decision I've made in two years. Why, oh WHY have I not been eating Tom's pulled pork sandwiches my whole life? It was amazeballs: moist, delicious, flavorful, tender, delicious, juicy, zingy, delicious, delicious, delicious. I ate the whole dang sandwich. Needless to say, I don't think I'll be going back to my old, strictly plant-eating habits. Thank you, Tom, for opening up my eyes and making me realize what I've been missing out on - the best pulled pork sandwiches in Phoenix!  Sorry, super cute piggies. You're just so ridiculously tasty. :("}
{"text":"Ordered a Pulled pork Sandwich (slaw on the side) and Homemade fries. Also grabbed a brownie. The sandwich was okay. The BBQ was pretty damn good but the sauce  (mild) left something to be desired. The fries were chewy? They definitely were not fresh. The slaw was not very flavorful and the dressing was watered down. The brownie....very cake like and flavorless. I'm a Native Texan and have eaten BBQ all over the nation. If this is what Chicago has to offer....I'll pass."}
{"text":"Good restaurant, good food, clean atmosphere. The menu is a little confusing but the people are nice. Prices are high but they give a discount to some of the businesses nearby. Overall I would say Tom's is good, but falls short of great."}
{"text":"Tom's is back! In honor of National Hot Dog day I went and grabbed a Chicago Dog. Billie who formerly ran the Tempe location greeted us right away. She didn't pressure my gf to order and chatted us up. She brings personality to the experience. I paired the dog with bbq beans and a brownie. The dog is just like you would get from a vendor on State St. Took me back home for a minute. And the beans were hands down the best I've ever had. The brownie was delicious. Moist and messy! Now that the right people are running it we will be back. Especially on Tuesdays when kids under 12 eat free when an adult gets a meal"}
{"text":"Great lunch specials and awesome staff. This place is great when you have a limited time for lunch. Pulled pork is delicious. Not a overwhelming amount if slaw. Great place for lunches. Haven't tried dinner yet. That will be next."}
{"text":"We tried the Italian beef sandwich and the chopped beef brisket. Both were excrllent.   Can't wait to come back and try some more items from the menu.  We had a simple rib tip and it is definitely first choice for the next visit. I also am going to make sure to save room for dessert. Homemade peach cobbler!  Billie was working the counter, & I think I may have met a long lost family member. She was so much fun and so welcoming."}
{"text":"The food (catfish) is beyond good and the hospitality is even better. Stopped in with the family on a Friday night and was surprised with the friendliness of the staff, I think her name was Billy? We ordered our food and it came out very quick and was absolutely delicious! We definitely will call this our new place to get BBQ in the Tempe area from now on. Give it a shot, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is one of my fav bbq place. They make amazing loaded potato's. Yum. I always get the brisket. My friend recommended the chicken."}
{"text":"My first visit and I LOVE IT! Billie is so sweet and genuinely invested in her customers. The food is very high quality, fresh, homemade...delicious! I had the pulled pork sandwich with potato salad - both were fantastic! Tasted the beans & mac salad as well and I'm SOOOO impressed. Clean, happy, welcoming wonderful place! So glad I found it! Will be back FOR SURE. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Good BBQ pork sandwich. Fries are huge. I will go back again."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in Arizona that I have eaten so far. Worth every penny! Love the fish fry pulled pork and ribs"}
{"text":"Place has really gone down hill. Use to eat here once a week. Food is all reheated and most not made on site like it use to be. Everything is just kinda over dry and tasteless."}
{"text":"This place was dead on a Football Sunday with the Arizona Cardinals game televised.  Great for us but not for Tom's.  You guys have to realize that people must be passing your restaurant to watch the games at other places.  Seize the opportunity!  Otherwise, let me know when you plan to sell.  I'm interested."}
{"text":"Came out and tried a pulledpork sandwhich and my hubby got a sliced brisket sandwhich. The meat was so juicy and flavorful! Pulled pork melted in my mouth. Brisket had a saltier task but my husband loved it.  Got beans and mashed potatoes on the side. Yum!  ..and talk about service with a smile! What an upbeat  group of people staffed  here!"}
{"text":"Tom's is legit!!!! Their bone-in smoked chicken has to be the best chicken I've ever had. The brisket is great, excellent sides too. Potato salad, jalapeño Mac n cheese..... They are VERY friendly, table side delivery after a counter order. These local Tempe businesses need us, keep them open. Enjoy Tom's, you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"I have driven by this BBQ joint dozens of times and finally made the stop at 10 am today.  Walked up to the door to see they were not open until 10:30.  I thought that was reasonable and started back to my car.  Halfway back I hear Billie a dynamic ex New Yorker say \" I will open for you, baby\"  the experience was awesome from that point on.  She made me feel she owned the place.   Let's get to the food.  I had the rib tip dinner with homemade Cole slaw and  baked beans that had bits of rib tip (delicious).  The rib tips were nice and tight not parboiled type.  The Cole slaw did not have mayonnaise which was different for me and yet it was excellent. She gave me a taste of their brisket which was moist.  Could have used more smoke for my taste. Oh, I almost forgot.  Go with the homemade spicy sauce.  Perfect. I am taking a Italian beef sandwich and half slab of ribs home.  I will be back."}
{"text":"I will absolutely never come here again - The owner, Brenda, took my order when I came in and she was having issues with her register being online. Cool, fine. I waited patiently while she handled it. No big deal.  Well, she proceeded to run my card 4 times in an attempt to get the payment to go through. I was charged 4 times. I have since contacted the restaurant and spoke with Brenda (said the charges would come off), Jordan (was also told the charges would come off) and Patty (downright just rude, actually had the gall to ask me if I had sufficient funds in my account) - None of whom have been *willing* or *able* to help me. It looks like I'm going to have to contact my bank and file a police report.   Also, my fish was undercooked and my fries were soggy and dark like they don't change the fry oil often enough. I wish I could give 0 stars. Save your time and money. What a head ache for mediocre food.  *UPDATE: Yeah, turns out I was right and after 4 days of dealing with their nonsense they finally manually went in the system and refunded all of the charges. Didn't offer to refund my meal at all, just the extra charges. And it took the woman I spoke with about 10 minutes to fix it. Makes me wonder why she or anyone else didn't just fix it initially. Absolutely crap, lazy manager and shit food. Still 0 stars all around."}
{"text":"I feel terrible after eating here. I've had a lot of good, and mediocre bbq in my life, but this was really bad.  All of the meat in our sampler looked old and grey. The sausage was dry. The \"smoked\" flavor tasted like campfire soot. You'll enjoy your dinner more if you microwave old meat and rub it in campfire ash. I feel sick and ripped off."}
{"text":"Great place for b-b-que! The pulled pork dinner is tasty and very large portion. We both had left overs to take home. I'm not big on long reviews, if the food is good that is plenty information!!"}
{"text":"I've been going there since 1993. This is the best bbq I've had since coming out for Southern California. Their sauce is amazing Lots of heat choices to choose from. Meat is so fall of the bone tender. I even go there from Mesa where I live now. Love it!!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty mediocre bbq, not bad, just not \"great\" the way barbecue should be! I would say it was on par with honey bears, but I really enjoy the bbq sauce they used on my pulled pork sandwich. It was pretty expensive, my friends fish and chips turned out to $8-9 with a drink, geez. I think there are plenty of better alternatives like AZ bbq co or joe's real bbq, or if you need something in the area you can't go wrong with somme burros right next door."}
{"text":"We finally decided to try Tom's BBQ yesterday. We are so glad we did! We no longer need to travel far for some pretty amazing BBQ. The Smokey flavor is fabulous. The \"hot\" BBQ sauce is actually hot! The sides were fresh and complemented the meat nicely. This is now our favorite BBQ joint! Serving sizes are on the large side!"}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time and was really happy with the food and experience. I had the pulled pork, no bun, with French fries and potato salad. It was really delicious! I was surprised by the coleslaw hidden under the near- to was so good! Everything was great. I especially loved the potato salad, it was the mustard flavor version"}
{"text":"I refuse to pay the highway robbery prices touristas pay for a half rack of ribs at Lucille's restaurant in the Tempe marketplace, so when I came upon this down-to-earth looking BBQ place I was very hopeful. But as we sometimes say in New York, Fuhgedabout it! I've had BBQ in Chicago and this place doesn't come close.   I paid $20 for a 3-meat combo with 2 sides and a fountain drink. The one rib they placed on top was good, although not great. the five underneath it were thin and dry. The chicken and brisket were also dry as DUST! The baked beans were so tiny and drowning in a mug of thick molasses like sauce that I couldn't even taste them. Even my Diet Pepsi tasted over carbonated. The jalapeno mac & cheese was a fire-eating taste treat and that's the only thing I can half recommend about this place, other than the fast and friendly service. VERY poor food, unfortunately."}
{"text":"Food is awesome  People are super nice  The place is chill I will definitely come back !!!"}
{"text":"stop in to try the brisket I would say it was good just a little salty it's on the pricey side the sauce is terrible could not eat that the kid at the counter was grate very helpful told me all the specials expand bet they smoke there meat 14 HR or probably won't go back though there's too many good BBQ places not to have good sauce"}
{"text":"First time eating at Tom's. I had a pulled pork sandwich and Jalapeño Mac N Cheese. The staff was very friendly and the food was awesome!"}
{"text":"Very Fast and Friendly service! The food pretty much melt in my mouth and was surprised because of how fast it was brought to us being BBQ. I will definitely go back to this place and look forward to it to be honest."}
{"text":"Really awesome place! We've always wanted to try Tom's due to the # of times we've driven past the cute pink van. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich and we had the fried pickles as an appetizer. SO good! The house horseradish sauce is great. Service was wonderful and they had an assortment of tables inside and outside. We'll be back"}
{"text":"Great place to meet with friends and enjoy a hearty meal with fresh-cut fries. They have beer on tap and friendly staff who care about their customers. The Friday fish fry is one of the best around! This place rocks!"}
{"text":"I've been going here for years!  This place is great!   Billie is the best cashier/manager in the world.  This place never fails."}
{"text":"Stopped in there to get lunch for my family.  Ordered 2 Brisket meals and pulled pork sandwich.  Very expensive for what we got.  Brisket meal was 4 slices of dry meat which was like cardboard, mini roll and soupy Mac and cheese.  No BBQ sauce.  The pulled pork was just ok.  Really bad.  I'm not going back.  Spent $40 for 3 meals and the best part was the coke.  Hubby was furious with me.....never going back."}
{"text":"Coming from Texas,  I take barbecue seriously.  All I have to say is ummmm ummmm good!  The brisket was flavorful and the sausage was excellent. If you love a little kick in flavor this is the place for you. Most barbecue spots just smoke their sausages but Tom's takes it to another level by searing the sausage to give a little crunch.  Different textures can bring a whole new element in a food that you may eat often.  Can't wait to try other menu items.  I would have posted a pic but the food was gone when I thought about it, hahaha."}
{"text":"I've been going to Tom's for the past 5 years. I can't say that I've ever had anything bad. The owner is constantly trying to improve the menu which I love because it adds a new twist to things. This last time I went I had the Tom's Special sandwich with a side of Macaroni Salad and an order of Fried Zucchini. The Sandwich was juicy, tender and full of flavor as usual (the portion is really big so you may want to consider only eating half). The Macaroni was perfectly cool and creamy. The kicker was the Fried Zucchini; in the past times I've ordered this and it was smaller round slices; now they are fresh spears and taste so much better. The only thing I would change is the ranch sauce that I dipped the Zucchini in, I tend to lean more towards a thicker more sour cream based Ranch style. This place has the best customer service and the prices are spot on with the portion sizes. So for all my carnivores out there make sure you visit Tom's, I'm sure you'll enjoy it."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I have been here a few times and love everything we try. The service is great. You can not go wrong with trying anything on the menu. They have homemade corn bread that taste like my Nana used to make. It's very homey feeling and it's not like a typical restaurant."}
{"text":"Been craving barbecue stop in there ordered fried pickles they are barely even warm The brisket sandwich is so fatty I can't even eat it! Just wasted $13! They don't even serve sweet tea!"}
{"text":"Best pulled pork sandwich I've had! My wife enjoyed the crispy chicken sandwich. But the fried zucchini stole the show. The portions were generous,  the staff was friendly and a very cozy environment. We'll definitively be back to try more of the menu options."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in Glendale I've had!  Think you got somewhere better??? Try this!!! These crappy reviews about flavor...it's never lacked flavor. I suppose if you like smothered in BBQ flavor it's not that.  I enjoy still tasting the flavor of the smoked meat! Brisket great Really though I love their Fish dinner, everything you could ever want in a fish fry!  Thank you guys for working so hard, I love you staff and food!"}
{"text":"Understated, no-frills kind of place, but REALLY good BBQ. Their brisket is melt-in-your-mouth delicious!"}
{"text":"Darn it!  I thought I was special.  They treat everyone like family here, and I thought it was only me.  Don't come for a quiet meal.  This is more like visting Mom's house for dinner.  And I love it!"}
{"text":"Below average! I was not impressed, and did not care for their food.  My husband and I recently moved to the area and have been hoping to try Tom's BBQ for a while.  We placed an order for pick-up.  We live just down the road.  We ordered a sampler meal that came with BBQ ribs, hot links, pulled pork, beef brisket and BBQ Chicken (whole thigh and a leg) as well as three sides.  For our sides we chose green beans, coleslaw, bbq beans.  On a positive note I will say that I liked the meat on the ribs.  However I did not care for the small bones I found on the excess rib meat, I used my fingers to pull them out and eat the shreds of edible meat.  Poor butchering in my opinion. Secondly, the pulled pork was stringy, the texture was like hair meat! No actual substance or chucks to the pork, this says low quality pork or just over cooking.  The chicken had little edible meat on it, and beef brisket was passable albeit average, I didn't try to hot links, and the BBQ beans were tasty but not the best I've had.  I really don't understand how a place with so many good reviews can serve food like this?  Am I just one of the un-lucky ones???  Sad to say it will be some time before we go back, if ever.  Many of the other reviewers like the fish.  I would try that but I'll never convince my husband to go back for that, he dislikes fish with a passion."}
{"text":"While visiting Arizona I was driving down Baseline Road in Tempe and noticed a place called Tom's BBQ Chicago Style. What caught my eye in particular was the signage stating that they carried Chicago Style Italian Beef. The next time I went down Baseline road I made sure to stop by and give it a try.  I walked in to find a small restaurant. After looking over the menu I noticed they did indeed serve Chicago style hot dogs, and being the hot dog critic I obviously had to try one. I also ordered an Italian Beef as they had a big sign in front and I figured it must be a specialty of theirs, after about a 10 minute wait my food was ready.   We'll start with the Italian Beef. This Italian beef was bland, they had the soggy part right. The bread was right, it had the right texture and softness. The Italian Beef meat itself did not have the usual Italian Beef seasoning that I find in Chicagoland. I've had worse Italian Beef sandwiches, but for a place putting this at the top of their signage I would expect it to be better.  The hot dog was even worse. This was a giant sloppy mess of a hot dog. The poppy seed bun was the right type (not a given in Arizona), but there was about three hot dogs worth of mustard on this thing. There was way too much tomato and too thick, this caused tomato water to soak the bun causing the bun to become soggy. There was a thick and watery pickle slice that caused the bun to be even soggier. The relish was also applied too liberally, while it was the neon green style of relish typically found in Chicago the application was just a mess. There were two sport peppers about the length of the dog between the two of them. Then cucumber slices and practically no onion. The bun fell apart as I attempted to pick it up, this was just a total disaster of a hot dog and puts a bad name on Chicago style dogs.  Overall Tom's BBQ was a big disappointment. Despite signs indicating \"Chicago Style\" all over the outside, the two Chicago style food items I had here were lousy. Perhaps their BBQ is better but if and when I return to Arizona I'll take my chances elsewhere. Two stars for Tom's."}
{"text":"Its a neat place but the food is just ok. The portions are good size and the restaurant like I said is a good looking place. But the food just needs a little something extra. I would recommend this place, I've only been twice and would give them another try as it wasn't by any means a bad experience."}
{"text":"Food was good, but I spent 30 dollars on a meal that was supposed to feed 2 and the sides were small. I don't eat a lot to begin with and what was given was not enough. Probably won't go back. Food was good though!"}
{"text":"Disappointing. I haven't been to Tom's in Mesa for many years. Unfortunately, this location is not the same. We have ordered take out twice here, and the family has been disappointed both times.  This second time actually made my stomach churn and convinced us that we wouldn't be back. My husband's brisket was nothing but fat. He couldn't even eat half of his meal because it was fat. They forgot my son's french fries, which caused nothing but drama and sheer disappointment once we got home from picking it up. There was no extra bbq sauce, which is just wrong to send take-out home to customers without extra sauce. Finally, my pulled pork was mostly soggy bun, not appetizing. Clearly, it's frustrating when you get home and you are missing items from your order and one of the main entrées isn't edible."}
{"text":"If you are looking for the benchmark of bad BBQ, you are in luck.   Where do I start?   The mashed potatoes were out of a box, the Jalapeno Mac was made with processed cheese......The best suggestion I could make for someone dining here is to smuggle in a really tasty BBQ sauce and drench your food in it and you may be able to choke down their lame attempt at smoked meat."}
{"text":"Stopped by here with my mom and my toddler for lunch after playing at the Kiwanis Park.  The walk up order process was super duper quick and the staff was very nice and seemed like they enjoyed their job (a big plus), but the food was sub-par (in every way... margarine??? yuuk!) and not anything I'd ever spend my money on again. My mom and I both had different plates and we both tried each others and were just not impressed. For my BBQ needs, I'll stick to Joe's in Gilbert, this place is not interesting enough and bland for me."}
{"text":"After moving to Arizona from Illinois, we decided to give Toms a try. The food was great and the service, especially Billie behind the counter, was fantastic. The jalapeño mac-n-cheese had a great kick to it! I would give a 5 star, however I feel as if the prices are high for what you get. We will definitely bring our friends and family from Illinois to enjoy some Tom's BBQ."}
{"text":"Great Chicago style BBQ in AZ.. The pulled pork is a must... And say yes to their spicy sauce... It truly is just like Chicago..."}
{"text":"So delicious! I love that this location opened up because I would drive to the Tempe location from Gilbert just because it is so delicious. I order the pulled pork with jalapeño mac and cheese almost every time. My mouth is watering just writing this review. You can get hot or mild bbq sauce depending on your taste and there are pumps with extra in case you want to drown your meat like I do. The people working are always super friendly and treat you like you've been friends for years. Love it and it's definitely one of my favorite bbq places ever."}
{"text":"Great BBQ. Awesome friendly service. I had the ribs and my son had the brisket sandwich."}
{"text":"We had these guys cater a lunch Tuesday for the Journey of Hope, The true impact of the Journey of Hope can be felt through its programming across the nation. After riding an average of 75 miles a day, you won't find team members napping preparing for the next day's ride. They will be dancing at a friendship visit with a local group that supports people with disabilities, participating in a game of wheelchair basketball, performing puppet shows to educate children on the abilities of people with disabilities, and learning life lessons that will impact them for the rest of their lives. This journey is service beyond self and the men of Pi Kappa Phi have been dedicated to people with disabilities since 1977.  Thanks to Toms BBQ, all the riders and crew loved the lunch. Larry and Tracy"}
{"text":"First time here !! Loved it  Great pulled pork sandwich and wonderful service ( Billy is wonderful)  Will be back soon"}
{"text":"3 strikes and you are out.  I've now given this place 3 tries.  Not going back again.  The service was not good and the food was only mediocre at best."}
{"text":"We eat at Toms pretty often.  The bbq is awesome, but so is everything else!  Don't sell yourself short just getting bbq.  Get the fish, get the Italian beef, try their burgers and don't miss Toms pride and joy!  Fair prices, excellent food and friendly service!"}
{"text":"During my lifetime (63 yrs) I have eaten BBQ at some of the best BBQ joints in the USA. Tom's BBQ has got to be one of the best BBQ places I have ever had the pleasure of trying out. Normally for a new BBQ place I would order the ribs (that is my 'go to' dish for any BBQ place. However, this time I ordered the Brisket Platter and my wife ordered the Pulled Pork Sandwich *her favorite BBQ order\" for lunch. All I can say is WOW. In fact that is what I said after every bite. The brisket and pulled pork was off the charts. Cole slaw was a perfect accompaniment to the brisket and delicious. Even the fries are outstanding.  Gotta go back and get the RIBS!!!"}
{"text":"We were there 16 days from epoc and were very impressed.  They are a new business and we've been back several times over the past few weeks and they seem to be going through the normal process of figuring out how to run a restaurant effectively -- ie manage demand, workload etc. So sometimes the food is inconsistant. If they can make sure their food quality stays good they will be the best BBQ in town. I recently had a competitor who used to be my favorite and I was wishing it was Toms instead !"}
{"text":"Went here to get a lbs of burnt ends. Always liked the pulled pork and thought I would pay the extra for the beef. Took the order and went home. To my suprise the burnt ends were actually burnt fat. The amount of meet in the order was less then half. Huge chucks of fat had been thrown in and considered beef. You are paying for weight here and they were offsetting that with the leftovers. This location is now off my list of bbq joints to hit. Next time will go to the honey baked ham store next door."}
{"text":"I'm really pissed off. We came at 9pm. Ordered got our food at 9:10 they brought it to us in a bag. We were clearly all sitting down, wanting to eat in. 3 kids, 3 adults. The guy says sorry we close at 9,Umm okay. Well you had no problem taking our money after 9. It was not going to kill you to let us eat for freaking 10 mins. My god. I have had better service from freaking taco bell.     Get your head out of your ass and treat your customers better."}
{"text":"Hidden Bbq gem, good amount of smoke taste not too much just right. Beef is good quality."}
{"text":"I was very unimpressed with the service, the lack of interest that the staff showed to making the meal what we wanted and the quality left much to be desired. I asked to substitute a meat (willing to pay extra if necessary) and the staff would not make exceptions (even when we offered to pay more for the upgrade). I have been going to Toms for many years and I will not be back. Way overpriced for what you get."}
{"text":"First off, if you are anywhere in the east valley go to WALDOS BBQ in MESA. Toms doesn't hold a candle to Waldos. Second time coming here and once again it was decent to sub par. The guy behind the counter was on personal calls the entire time, even making a few customers wait until he was done! Such a tool.. Tried the fish fry this time, not bad for all you can eat but, the hush puppies tasted like they had saw dust for filling. Last time, I had the brisket and it was a bit dry but, I'll give them the benefit of the doubt."}
{"text":"Too over priced for the food fries always taste old baked pototao small and the sweet potato pie is 4.00 for one slice really I can bake one. The fried fish us ok but no season ."}
{"text":"The pulled pork sandwich is worth the drive for me.  Love the hot BBQ sauce.  The Jumbo sandwich is stacked with a delicious mountain of pulled pork.  I will definitely be back again soon."}
{"text":"Their corn bread is so good!  And so is there crispy chicken sandwich with sauce on it"}
{"text":"It's pretty decent bbq. Pretty decent service. Not amazing, but decent. One woman is very rude who works there, and actually snapped at our family so I would not say it is amazing service."}
{"text":"Worst BQ ever! BQ tips were 1/2 grissel. Meat was so tough it was like leather. The BQ was totally full off grissel. terrible ! I would not recommend it."}
{"text":"Seriously, unless you really want to get your insides wiped clean, don't eat here. The food my wife and I got tonight bordered on old style roach coach greasy. No flavor, unless you count the kinda salty ketchup they call BBQ sauce. The lady at the counter was super nice though. For a place that calls itself true BBQ, they have a lot to learn, or they just lost their way.  Oh, we both has the two meat combos, she had the smoked chicken and rib ends, while I had the brisket and pulled pork."}
{"text":"Mostly average bbq, but this place has the best chicago style dog since scouts closed.  Its noteworthy when I'll drive somewhere just for a hotdog, but tom's never lets me down."}
{"text":"Their food is terrible!!!! Almost inedible --  definitely unchewable! As bad as the food is, their service is worse!  Lousy customer service! Bad attitude!  Rude people!  Made the experience even worse. You will be much happier someplace else. I've had much better food at Taco Bell!!!"}
{"text":"From Chicago and this place has best Italian beef and Chicago dog in the Valley.  Not quite like home but c'mon.  Let's face it. You aren't gonna get AL's in AZ.  Better than Portillos here which  just didn't feel like the Portillos back home. Fish dinner on Lenten Friday's is good.  Jalapeño Mac and cheese is straight up delicious.  Could eat a whole pot of that.  Portions are generous.  The BBQ is decent.  Not great but definitely decent.  I actually like their sauce.  Sweet tangy and spicy.  Service is always friendly and fast.  I've had lunch here enough they see me coming and know my order. Just good quick food even though not necessarily good for you!"}
{"text":"Dear sweet barbecue gods, this place is a travesty against all things brisket (which I have eaten a thousand and one plates of, and adore).   Shelled out over $18 for a single meat plate that came out with a rubbery, reheated mass of grey brisket more fat than beef, drowned in a sauce whose grocery store levels of mediocrity were only enhanced by its tepid room temperature. And a cold roll to round out the whole, horrifying experience.  Brisket lovers = beware."}
{"text":"Had a meal for 20 delivered to my home. Every thing was PERFECT! I just cleared my counters and everyone loved the meal. Then 2 hours later we reheated and reserved. It was even better the second go-around. This was the easiest party I have ever had. Thank you and keep up the great business."}
{"text":"Tried it once.Food was great. Look foward to going back for more."}
{"text":"Just plain old nasty food!  Gave it 3 chances since Oct 2012 and April 12, 2013 and they failed miserably each time! I'm just done at this point!"}
{"text":"The counter help was charismatic and makes you feel really welcome. Super sweet and genuine or is a darn good act, lol. The place was clean and well decorated but the food was ok but nothing special."}
{"text":"Well, the 2nd time was not the charm at this place. The smoked chicken sandwich was three thick slices of said smoked chicken. It was tossed between a hamburger bun and drenched in sauce that turned this into a knife and fork event. Too bad that the chicken was cold and so were the baked beans. I really did not want to come back and microwave fresh food, but that was the case at Tom's. The chicken was smoked, but it tasted like smoke, no other seasonings or anything going on here. The Baked Beans are still good, but this visit proved that Tom's need a bit of a lesson  in serving hot food and food that is a value. At 6 bucks, it seems like a good deal for sandwich, but it wasn't."}
{"text":"Every time we visit Arizona we always go to Tom's. There Italian Beef is fantastic with peppers and grilled onions, makes my mouth water just thinking about it. We also had there Vienna hotdogs there great as well."}
{"text":"Needed a good, quick meal and this place fit the bill perfectly.  I ordered the ribs and fish combo and it was very good!  The person behind the counter was very personable and my meal was ready quickly.  I would definitely recommend,"}
{"text":"Came here after a coworker recommended this place as the best barbecue in town. I didn't think I'd ever be a regular at a barbecue place (unless it's anything like Soulfire in Boston with the unlimited spicy sauces) because my boyfriend always adamantly insists \"I can cook this at home for cheaper!\" whenever we get barbecue BUT. I was proven so, so wrong.  The lady who's always at the register,  Billie, is quite the character and adds to the charm. I love how nice everyone is. Nobody's coming here for a candlelit dinner, let me tell you. But I think that's a good thing.  I've had the slab of ribs (good), house burger (OK), unlimited fried catfish  (every Friday, you have to request them to cook more every time you finish your plate), and the pulled pork burger. By FAR the best thing I've had thus far is the pulled pork sandwich! It's incredibly good.  Their peach pie dessert is all right. I don't really think it's worth the $3 price tag, but it'll hit the spot if you need something sweet after every savory meal. (Or mosey over to Aloha Yogurt on the other side of the lot for something light!)  Glad I live so close by. I'll have to try their unlimited rib tips night, which I think is every Thursday. Oh and they have tons of sauces to choose from next to the soda machine, including a bottle of sugar free barbecue sauce that's super low in calories!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Ribs and Hot Links.  The ribs unfortunately were not good at all.  The ribs seems like neither charcoal nor wood ever kissed them.  They had the appearance of oven cooked ribs with no flavor or smoke whatsoever.  Tender yes, but very disappointing considering the original place on 33 ave and Indianschool had authentic slow smoked over wood and charcoal Ribs 20 years ago.  On  good note the BBQ Beans were excellent."}
{"text":"I always have the best experience at Tom's. Always friendly and the food is always the best. This place deserves more buisness then it gets. 5 stars"}
{"text":"Go for the food and enjoy the friendly service.  Billie will take good care of you. Hubby enjoyed the garden burger and I had bbq chicken salad. Shared fried pickles, zucchini & the fried mushrooms which were huge & crispy. Will go again before we leave!"}
{"text":"Wow! What an amazing atmosphere! Not only did i walk in and get a hand shake from the the owner Rick and his amazing manager Victor but the lovely tender of the bar had my drink order ready before i even sat down. I traversed an awestrikingly clean establishment with an open dining area and made my way to an impressive patio area. Every single table had a private heater along with other standing heatin units for the whole. The, large impressively sharp televisions, were well placed.  Well done my friends. I look forward to seeing you again soon!"}
{"text":"Not great, not terrible. The star of the show was the roll that you get. Other than that, nothing really worth writing home about. The staff was friendly enough and the prices are decent."}
{"text":"This place is right down the road from my hotel. Stopped by for a quick dinner and had the pulled pork sandwich and macaroni salad. Both are decent.  If I'm back in town - I will probably eat here again."}
{"text":"Had for the first time and had the Brisket sandwich.  It was ok.  They brisket in my opinion was not cooked long enough. It was very stringy and if brisket is cooked correctly it should easily pull apart.  It's tasted ok.  The rub they use is not super flavorful and just the texture of the meat for brisket is not what it should have been.  I may give it another shot but probably not anytime soon."}
{"text":"This is not bbq totally not worth my money the pull pork sandwich was not the best I also got the hot link and it was not that good I would love to give this place a 2 1/2 star but not possible and the bbq sauce was weird"}
{"text":"Never knew this was here, but now that we do, we are coming back often. The pulled pork is heavenly; the smoked chicken was an orgasmic experience; and they gave us more food than we knew what to do with. The BBQ smell is the best!"}
{"text":"We recently threw a picnic for over 100 people and got over two dozen pounds of the smoked chicken, and it was phenomenal!  Very tender, melt-in-your-mouth stuff.  Many of our guests said the same; all the comments were extremely positive.  The staff was very friendly, and they even gave us six bottles of free BBQ sauce when we picked up the order.  We would definitely call Tom's for a similar shindig in the future."}
{"text":"Straight fire  you pay for what you get. It's hard to leave hungry. Onion Strings are a must have IMO. Fish is always good."}
{"text":"We love Tom's and my husband John told the boss lady \"portillos ain't got shit on Toms. This Toms. Not any of the other ones just this one!\" And he went to the same high school as Phil Portillos so it must be true!!"}
{"text":"Subpar meat and barely average sides. The fries were the best thing of the entire meal. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"I have been in Arizona only a year and finally found the treasure . I am big on smoky flavor , and this place offers it all , from the service to the food , classy place and a great feeling . burnt ends, ribs, smoked chicken, housemade amazing chips , rolls, brisket , the list does not end. it will take a while to get through the menu. but that is what makes it a MUST visit . I AM A REAL CHEF, so this is not fluff"}
{"text":"What's with the hype of the big pink PIG?! This place is over-priced. They could work on better customer service and less clutter.  Had the bbq pork and mac n cheese, it was okay. But too much bbq sauce."}
{"text":"Tom's barbecue in Chandler is just south of mediocre. While not terrible, it's just not good.  One thing struck me odd immediately.. why doesn't it smell like smoke in the restaurant? How are they making this bbq?!   Also very clearly a microwave in the center of the chefs station. If I wanted any warmed microwaved items I'd just stay home."}
{"text":"The plastic in my pulled pork, overly dry hamburger for my daughter. The service was just nothing to write anything nice about.  I would suggest in the future if you like your food and wait staff sub par.  Too much to ask?   I suggest if you serve plastic in the food maybe the manager could apologize, maybe even take that off the bill.  I'm still wondering where plastic would come from?"}
{"text":"Having lunch with my Mom. She found a twist tie in her sandwich, we took it to the front counter and the cashier asked for it. Not a soul bothered to come out and apologize, nothing. This is what service you can expect. Last time I recommend Tom's BBQ."}
{"text":"Not as good as I remember from growing up in Chandler. The brisket was chewy and grey. Hand cut frys and the homade onion rings were da bomb. The spare ribs were smoky and tender, no sauce needed.  The pulled pork was just okay. The sauce, it must be a Chicago thing; only hot or mild, what's up with that? Every descent bbq spit has several very good sauces to choose from. TOM Needs to step up his bbq game.  A $40 lunch for mediocre bbq, I won't be back, I could get the same lunch at Dickies for $25."}
{"text":"Meh. My husband took me here for lunch this weekend and neither of us loved our food.  The service was good and we got our food fast but nothing wow to make us want to go back.  We got pulled pork sandwich and the ribs. Again the food was... meh!"}
{"text":"Being from Kansas City, I was skeptical about barbecue in Phoenix. Friends who live here wanted to try this establishment. All I can say is I should've followed my gut feeling, regarding this barbecue. Does not compare to all. We were there for dinner, I've got a brisket dinner, the brisket was cold, with some warm barbecue sauce on top of it. Well the meet was good, I was totally just satisfied with the temperature. The mac & cheese was also not hot as well as the baked beans, temperature was cold. Even my friends to the company they who live in the area decided that we don't return."}
{"text":"Meh. Good sized portions but the meat was nothing special. The pulled pork was moist but it seemed like it was very fatty. The chicken was ok - decent amount. The sauce was pointless - very little flavor. I tried the hot, but it tasted like the mild with a bit of jalapeño juice. The sides looked all store bought. Overall, there's nothing to bring me back."}
{"text":"This was probably my worst BBQ experience . My husband thought the meat was ok. The sides were warmed up fries and cold in the middle mac & cheese..."}
{"text":"We've breakfast eaten here twice and it's been great both times! Chorizo is awesome, biscuits and gravy are superb! Sausage and eggs are good as well! Keep it up Toms!"}
{"text":"Now we remembered why we haven't been back to this place in years and we live right down the street.  Although the staff is very nice, the bbq chicken was AWFUL, it was compressed chicken or at least tasted like rubber and like it came out of a can, it had fat in it. Yuk!  I didn't return it and didn't ask for my $$ back, but rather took the untouched part to someone who was hungry on the street -- I know that sounds bad but I hate to have food thrown away when someone else may love it and by some of the other reviews, it looks like that's the case.  The sauce was also awful (in my books) and the fries were limp and greasy.  We like to shop locally, but this place needs to step it up to get 5 stars.    Oh also the ladies room had a bad sewer smell.   We definitely will not go back."}
{"text":"I love their variety sauces and that there is a super spicy one. I always order the pull porked sandwich and honestly put all 3 sauces in my sandwich and all over their crispy fries. I just can't get enough of the sauces. Also whichever cashier is there when I go they are always so personable and sweet! And trust me I'm so awkward and hate making small talk with any cashiers at restaurants but you can just tell they genuinely care and what you order. Also I like taking my 6 year old nephew so he can pay because there's usually a cute little girl his age that he sometimes talks to behind the counter.  Anyway the food is super awesome and not too heavy for bbq."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go for lunch. I've had the Italian Beef, Brisket and fish recently and everything was very good. I like the spicy BBQ sauce."}
{"text":"Called on Sunday evening to order carry-out for a large group of family that was in town and was very disappointed. 1 of every 2 sides we tried to order were no longer available and the customer service was lacking as well. This is a location we frequent for lunch and dinner and sadly will not be going back."}
{"text":"So we love BBQ.. Just gonna start off with that. We want our meat to be fresh and hell just off of grill type of meat!.   This place did not have that. It was like we got the damn left overs.  My husband got the pulled pork sandwich his results: warmed up, gotten from the bottom the tray, and ruined the sandwich.  Grandpa got the beef brisket sandwich results: not fresh, it was cold, dry, tough, and you can tell has been sitting out because there was absolutely no pink anywhere in those tough slices. I got a hot link sandwich results: burned hot links, extremely dry and tough.  Overall, not going back. The lady was an interesting character, a customer notified her that the root beer was out. She said \"okay don't touch it\". And did nothing about it. The inside to me is pretty gross as far as the kitchen goes.. So i chose 1 star because I have to and Because the BBQ Sauce is OKAY!"}
{"text":"My family and I went last night to go try this place out. It was a great experience! We were seated right away and the food was delicious! The waitress was great also! She was very attentive, and had excellent customer service I believe her name was Lauren! We will definitely be returning and spreading the word!"}
{"text":"I know this is a barbeque restaurant, but I go here for the amazing curly fries. If you order one of the specials, it comes with fries, but not the curly fries. They are worth the extra money though."}
{"text":"I actually enjoyed the lady behind the counter that everyone is complaining about. However, the food leaves a lot to be desired. I got the pulled pork sandwich and I was disappointed. I have made better \"bbq\" pork in my crockpot at home. The beans on the side were ok and that's being nice. Never again."}
{"text":"The staff here were quite pleasant. I opted for the All in BBQ dinner and was very disappointed. The chicken was over cooked, the ribs were tasteless, the brisket was all fat and the beans were under cooked. The sausage, macaroni and corn bread were just average. I would not recommend spending money here."}
{"text":"Most of the reviews that I have read below are correct as far as Im concerned. The food here is average at best, and the service was just ok.  In the past 12 years, we have eaten as seveal of Toms BBQ locations and have had better food/service.  Our waitress was friendly, but did not even ask how the food was, I think because she didnt want to hear 'so so'.  My husband had the rib plate, ordered with BBQ sause on the side, of course, it arrived drowned in BBQ sause, when the waitress dropped it off, she appologized for it but said she brought extra napkins for him (still dont know why if she noticed it, she didnt have to cook correct it prior to brining it out to the table) and I had the Buffalo Chicken Salad, again drenched in ranch dressing.  Honestly, how can you mess up a salad? Thats how!   Also, lunch 'specials' are $10 a plate, give or take a few cents, which in my opinion, isnt a great deal.  South Chandler struggles to have/keep good restuarants. As mentioned in another review, RED, WHITE and BREW has closed their doors, which is in the same parking lot. Atleast they had good beer and a cool place to go out with our without the family.  Im sure this place wont make it much longer either, as its never busy either.  It would be great to see Teakwood Grill, Joes Real BBQ or 5 Guys head south for us down here in need! Bottom line. Save your money and your time.."}
{"text":"Any place that has the words Cornhole Corner written on the patio wall has my vote!    This place is awesome. I love BBQ so that helps. Nice little patio, awesome brisket!!! Good Menu!!   Laid back... Great for a starting place to drink and maybe walk across to Monestary."}
{"text":"My family and I have been going to Tom's for over 15 years! We love bbq, it is the best melt in your mouth ...hands down, no competition. I have also used their catering services.We initially started going to the Country Club location(that Superman phone booth is great) but now frequent the NOrth Mesa location. I love this location, the atmosphere is great and family friendly. Oink if you love Tom's!!!"}
{"text":"Found in a shopping center plaza...I had the chili which was very well seasoned, and had a good spice to it. My dad had the bbq salad which he enjoyed.  Check out the restroom, it's pretty cool. Overall, on another trip out that way, I would go back and sample some other plates."}
{"text":"Food was gross, mushy and service was terrible. Drinks never came out..had to ask for them when someone other than our waiter gave us our food. Wont be coming back."}
{"text":"Just returned from a delicious dinner at Tom's. Billy behind the counter was great- extremely personable and made the great food that much better. I had the brisket and you could cut it with a fork... yumm :) Fiance had the pulled pork in which he grudgingly shared a taste with me because he was enjoying it so much. Will def. be back- keep on doing what your doing.   Person below me- 3 minute wait? at a dinner place? That's nothing!"}
{"text":"As former Tempe, AZ residents we had enjoyed Tom's BBQ when we lived there.  We are in Sun Lakes now and we were very happy to discover their new location.  We really love the pulled pork sandwiches.  The employees are all very welcoming and kind.  We even got to meet \"Tom\" a the Grand Opening.  If I had one request it would be to improve the corn on the cob.  Not sure if they keep it warm in water or what but it lacks flavor.  The BBQ beans are to die for!! Love them."}
{"text":"We tried Tom's BBQ for the first time.  Not the best BBQ I have ever had.  Not the worst BBQ I have ever had.   The ribs were ok but not a lot of meat on them.  The rest of the meat was salty.  Corn was terrible as also the mash potatoes and gravy, real bad.  The rolls were fresh and the BBQ beans were very good.  The Lady who took our order was very pleasant.  The place itself is bland but they do have a tv with sports.  I have to agree with someone else's comment, how do you smoke meat in a strip mall?  If I was at the strip mall and hungry I might go back, maybe for a hamburger but I would not drive out of my way for the BBQ."}
{"text":"I think the problem with Tom's BBQ is they have loss their touch.   When I first started working in Tempe, this place was ridiculously good. The brisket taste like it came right off the grill, and the BBQ sauce was complete heaven. Now the brisket taste like I microwaved it the day after I bought it. I can't really pinpoint when this happened, but it felt like a downward progression over time. It's been almost five years of eating here, and I go less and less each year.   Hopefully they can regather whatever it was that made them seem special to me years ago. I would really like to eat the BBQ I remember when I originally found this place after a long days work. I am pulling for this place, I want to see it happen."}
{"text":"Outstanding pulled pork. Huge helping of delicious pulled pork. Whenever we go to Phoenix we make this a definite lunch stop. I can't understand how anyone could give a poor review. It's not fancy but the food is great."}
{"text":"On occasion by family likes to eat here. I usually get take out. The BBQ is pretty good. They portions are decent and the service is friendly enough.   Do not order the pecan pie. It is very bad. Both times I tried it, the crust has been sitting in the syrup for days, so it is soggy and has formed into part of the gelatinous blob of pecan goo on top.  The manager tried to make up for it by giving me a free piece the next time I came in, as he thought it was just a badly make pie. Even the second piece was bad. He told me if the second piece was also bad, he would be happy to treat me to a free dinner and he would stop ordering pecan pie from that vendor. It was and he did.  My husband likes the brisket and I like the ribs. BBQ is one of those things I haven't mastered making at home, so I'm happy to go out and pay for it. These guys are pretty good, so I keep going. It's close to my house and they are always friendly and quick."}
{"text":"Tom's BBQ in Chandler is amazing.  The food is excellent.  And they have great weekly specials. The staff were very friendly.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I got a slightly bad feeling when I walked in to pick up our carry out order. It smelled like sewage!  There were three servers chit chatting in the front and one quickly pointed to the bar when I told the I was picking up. The small bar was fairly full, and lots of conversations going on. I had to stand behind two people who were really involved in conversation and I was practically on top of them and awkward. The bar tender didn't acknowledge me for a few minutes even though she looked right at me. Finally she grabbed my order and was super rude. She was definitely having a bad day.  The place was empty other than the bar, and I don't know why they don't use the servers who aren't busy to take care of the carry out orders!?  Finally got home with the food.  Wow.  My husband opened his Jumbo Smoked Chicken dinner.  It was quite small, and just unappealing altogether.  Posted a photo of it, check it out.  The taste was like \"rubbery ham\".  GROSS.  Next I opened my smoked chicken breast sandwich.  Bun = hard, meat = full of fat chunks and gristle, sauce = the cheapest bottle at the store . Had to take off more than half of the \"meat\".  You can get better meat in precooked packages at the grocery store.    I will never eat here again and can not believe people go here at all.  NASTY."}
{"text":"Toms BBQ the bbq is not bad, the portions are small y you pay for even a slice of pickle. You pay way more for their just average to small portions of food than it is worth. I don't like the feeling of leaving hungry or breaking the bank to get enough to eat in there.They have been under new management y it is not helpful. Only stop there if my last choice. Live close but it's just a rip off to my family y friends to eat their. Togo orders you even get ripped off more. I'm done w Toms BBQ. Have happy holidays y when I want bbq I go to Bobby Q it is pricy but classy 5 star restaurant w delicious food y upscale adults,nice lighting y romantic y does serve cocktails. This place is a treat y  lavish it around the holidays it will be awesome. Call to see if you need reservation. Sometimes it's crowed but this place is very large but cozy."}
{"text":"The meat was disgusting! Not only was it \"fatty\"  every forkful of meat tasted like a mouth full of oil. Barf! I thought for a BBQ place it would be somewhat leaner and not dripping with grease. Never again! Not to mention the people are so-o incredibly rude that work there. I mean seriously? The place was nothing special."}
{"text":"My husband and I went on a date night! It was kind of slow in there but the lady that runs the place was super awesome so friendly! Made you feel like you were at home having dinner with your family the lady that ran the counter was super sweet to and of course the food was delicious! We had Tom's BBQ cater our wedding that's how marvelous their food is. You should definitely try it if you haven't already"}
{"text":"I went in and ordered a pulled pork sandwich, side of fries. My boyfriend ordered rib tips, and a side of baked beans.   I love the atmosphere of the place, silly decorations. Lady behind the counter made me laugh and was nice.   My sandwich was really good, LOVE the BBQ sauce. Sandwich kind of fell apart, but that's expected. Tried my boyfriends and let me tell you those rib tips were smoked PERFECTLY.   Definitely would recommend"}
{"text":"AWESOME BRISKET!!!!!! Have to come here for the brisket..... Just totally awesome..."}
{"text":"Great BBQ! Love the brisket and pulled pork. Fries are addicting. Great for Friday fish night. Their coleslaw is a family favorite. Vast menu with many options. Great for groups. This place is way better than Famous Dave's."}
{"text":"I have been in Glendale AZ for about half a year now and this is the first time I tried the area's BBQ. To be fair I am used to \"great\" BBQ from around the country, Texas, KC, South Carolina, etc. So trying out a local BBQ place is not exactly fair. But I thought I would give it a try. There is the usual selection of meats at Tom's but that's about where it stops comparing to a \"great\" BBQ place. Walking in the place I noticed it was pretty much empty for a dinner crowd.  I ordered the half slab with Mac n chees and corn on the cob. The ribs texture felt as though they were boiled in water, not properly cooked the way ribs should be and the sauce tasted like it came out of a bottom shelf bottle of BBQ sauce from Food City. I had just a couple of the ribs before I had to toss them in the trash. The Mac n cheese and corn on the cob were \"OK\".  Overall, I will never return to Toms BBQ. If anybody can truly recommend a great BBQ place in the Phoenix area I would be happy to try it out."}
{"text":"Fried pickles are terrible, waitress said owners are from Chicago and they have the best Chicago hot dog in town. We ordered the Chicago hot dog, unfortunately it came with cucumbers, no big deal, pick them off but don't you dare say you're from Chicago and put cucumbers on a Chicago dog! Maybe you're from Indiana,  I don't know,  but Chicago,  come on now. Glad I didn't try the Italian beef, probably comes with zucchini on it, lol"}
{"text":"We had Tom's cater our wedding and we're thrilled!  They went over and above to make sure everything was AWESOME!  Steph was a delight to work with and delivered everything and more! We LOVE Tom's and our guests are still raving about the food. Do yourself a favor and check this place out!"}
{"text":"Lunch on Saturday, turned out to be quite disappointing.  I had the Brisket platter, this is not BBQ, it was all dried out and the so called bark was nothing more than a thick salty like substance on the outside edge.  The BBQ sauce was nothing more than tomato paste/sauce with sugar.  The restaurant was 83 degrees inside and when I asked one of the people working there is they could turn down the air 1 or 2 degrees she claimed it was the best it's going to get.  We will not be going back to this wanna be BBQ restaurant ."}
{"text":"I loved this place. The 1/2 slab of ribs were great. Fall off the bone tender and good smoke. The mild bbq sauce was great. There is a great variety. Billie is the lady that runs it for Tom and she is wonderful. We visited the entire time we were there, in between her taking great care with customers, and she made our lunch so special. Great food and great service. She blessed us with a piece of the fried fish they use on the Friday \"all you can eat\" and we're sold! Coming back on Friday night for sure. Everything is made fresh and you can taste it. There are other locations for Toms bbq but Billie is now a friend so the place on Olive is ours!"}
{"text":"Okay now I have been here for the last time for sure.  Every single time I go the mess up my order.  There is always something missing or wrong. The staff are nuts yelling at each other.  When you tell them and show them there is something wrong or missing they act like it's your fault.  If you get a to go order I STRONGLY SUGGEST that you check it before you leave!!!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere: Very down to earth and home-y feel to this place.   Service: The woman who served us was pleasant and warm. Service was pretty quick.  Food: the macaroni and cheese had jalapeños and was delicious! However the BBQ itself was average. I had a pulled pork sandwich which was alright but not amazing."}
{"text":"My wife had the pulled pork and I had the brisket sandwich.  They barely put any BBQ sauce on the sandwiches, and they don't have bottles of sauce ready available, you have to go get little tubs from the sauce dispenser.  Only problem is, that even then the sandwiches weren't that tasty."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is because they removed one of my favorite items which was the pizza puff. Otherwise, great place to get BBQ!"}
{"text":"This place is way overpriced for what it is, but the food is always decent when we go. The Server was sweet and the restaurant was clean. The pulled pork was soggy, but it wasn't bad tasting, just not the most fresh pulled pork I've ever had. If you're going to eat here, do it at lunch when they're a little bit cheaper."}
{"text":"Very conveniently located in Tempe, I had high expectations when I first visited Tom's BBQ. I ordered a pulled pork sandwich thinking it was a good standard item to try. The food was okay. The sauce was okay. The staff was friendly and the food came out quickly however my hunt for great BBQ in the valley will go on..."}
{"text":"I have passed this place a lot and finally decided to stop in for some BBQ. Our over all experience was ok. Our waitress was very nice but the food was not the best. I had pulled pork and my friend had the ribs and we both had Mac and cheese sides. The pulled pork sandwich Was not very warm and it was so greasy that my bun was completely soggy. My friend liked her ribs but she wishes she asked to have bbq sauce on them. The Mac and cheese was not very good and was will a little on the cold side and also a little soggy. I don't know if I would come back. But I am about second chances."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying this was not our first time at Tom's BBQ.  We've had good food here before but seems like something has changed for the worse.  We stopped by on 12/28 at 5:30 PM for dinner.  After we were seated I asked the server whether the ribs were good and his response was \"Yea, they are great but I have to tell you that we only have one half rack of ribs available\".  I was dumbfounded - what kind of BBQ place has only one half rack of ribs left at 5:30 PM??  I told him I would like the last half rack and to please go set them aside while for me.  Rather than going into great detail I'll summerize our dinner experience using the old fashion grading system.  Ribs:  C  - I'm sure they were left over from earlier in the week.  Outer skin was like shoe leather, inside meat was OK. Fish:   A - Nicely done and good size portion Margaritas:  D  - Way to sweet and little if any liquor French fries:  D - Greasy, tasteless, the cook's have to clean the deep fryer at least once a year or you get this kind of nasty french fries. Service:  A  If you looking for great BBQ - this isn't the place."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! Food is fantastic and you won't find a more enthusiastic owner and staff Happy to serve their patrons!!!   A favorite in our household for sure!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and the only thing that pops into my head is MEH. The BBQ Sauce is meh and leaves a nasty lingering after taste. The Rib Tip platter is ok, nothing to get too excited about this place. Meh, I've experienced better."}
{"text":"Recently decided to give Tom's another chance. Glad I did. We stopped going there about 5 years ago when they started including globs of fat cap in with brisket by the pound. Today I had a regular sized brisket sandwich ($6.99) that was perfectly smoked with minimal fat to cut off. Last week I had an excellent pulled pork jumbo sandwich ($8.99).  I still think their BBQ sauce is too sweet for my tastes. The buns hold up to the meaty sandwich. The sides are just average. The super-thin dill pickle slice on the side with sandwiches is perfect for cutting these meaty dishes (just wish it was a little bigger, or maybe 2 of these super-thin ones).  I will resume visiting this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Ambience, okay. Ribs are good but if you ask for hot, it is for \"gringos\". Amy, our waitress was endearing. They had a musician that night, Jeremy(?) and he did covers of Incubus, Bon Jovi,etc, and he did a good job."}
{"text":"Fresh, Tasty, and Delicious.  As I drove up to Tom's Bbq there was a small line of people gathered by the door waiting to enter the restraunt. All I have to say is the smell in the parking lot was great and even better as you enter the restaurant. Tom's has menus on the wall, including the lunch specials from 10:30a - 2:00p.   As we walked in we were greeted nicely by the staff and they quickly took our order; you then take a seat and your entree is brought to your table. I ordered the pulled pork  special with fries and a fountain soda.  The sandwich was delicious; lots of pulled & chopped pork, a fresh hot bun, sweet bbq sauce, and hot crispy fries. The generous portion of fries appeared to be fresh-cut and were delicious.   Overall, a solid BBQ joint at a good price."}
{"text":"Food was ok, service was bad. Ordered 2 sandwiches to go. Watched as multiple people who ordered after me got their food and finished it while I was still waiting for mine. When my food finally came out it was dropped on the table with a \" here's your food\" and she just walks away. Just rude servers here. I won't go back again. This was my 2nd bad experience here."}
{"text":"Great food! Not necessarily good for you, but great taste. Bbq & fried fish & Italian beef & more - owner is obviously from Chicago, lots of Chicago memorabilia - so lots of great tastes from there. Friendly little place too. Same lady at the front counter every time I've been there who's quite a character"}
{"text":"Where do I begin?  Long ago I remember \"Tom's BBQ\" at Alma School and Warner.  It was decent.  Until San Tan BBQ came to town it was my favorite.  (Then San Tan closed and I discovered Joe's!!)  Tom's long-since left the place I remember.  Well, we were in the area of Chandler Heights and Gilbert tonight and thought \"why not?\".  So we stopped in.  After all, Yelp showed 3 stars.  When we entered the place was packed.  Good sign, I'm thinking.  We were seated promptly, and the waitress came by quickly.  She wasn't much for chatting, but she was friendly and professional.  I ordered the pulled pork sandwich, my wife had the brisket sandwich.  We were very surprised how quickly the food came.  We both tried our beans first.  They were...OK.  Not really good, but not really bad either.  I removed the top bun because it seemed so small, but the meat was piled respectably thick.  Fine.  Put the bun back and take a bite.  This is where it goes wrong.  The meat was very tender.  That's about the best I can say about it.  The sauce was like a generic grocery store sauce.  Not bad, but not really good.  The meat seemed like it had been boiled, and then some sort of smoke flavor added.  It was nasty.  The \"smoke\" flavor was not right, and not good.  Almost like a burned flavor, but not quite that either.  The after-taste of that flavor lingered about an hour after we left.  (What is that?!)  Compare and contrast to either Dave's or Joe's (both of which are good, though Joe's is much better).  My wife's brisket sandwich was no better.  Well, maybe a little better.  She said it also seemed like it had been boiled, but there was no smoke flavor at all (so she didn't have to deal with the after-taste like I did).  She was, however, a bit nauseated until after we got home.  I understand...my stomach felt like I had just had a Big Mac (that always leaves me a little queasy with the feeling of a rock in my stomach).  It was further, but we should have gone to Liberty Market instead.  We thought about it, almost did it, but this was closer.  Bad choice.  Never again."}
{"text":"Great pulled pork!!!  Couldn't ask for a better place to get carry out, thanks."}
{"text":"This place is so good you smell it driving down the street before you get there! Literally everything looked good on the menu. I'm from Kansas City so I love my BBQ, the day we went I had the #3 Italian beef sandwich and I'd have to say it was the best I've ever had (my lips were tingling in a good way). This place is a must and Billie was the most amazing host. Will be returning soon! Location on baseline & mill ave in Tempe."}
{"text":"Dry brisket, good fries, not much else.  Bbq sauce had a metallic taste.  Service was great, ambiance was nice."}
{"text":"I love BBQ, Have lived for years in the \"BBQ belt\" and am open minded to all styles. I don't mind reasonably High prices if the talent and the love/passion are there to support is. Toms was just a let down for me, The prices were high, but for what you gettting, if price is your concern, best go to MCD's for their sandwich. The taste, the vibe, the kindness just wasn't there for us. Heck, the Q was dry! no amount of sauces can cover that up. I had my bride double check me in case I was Having a bad night, but nope, she thought the same.+  I like to grill.BBQ myself, but I love to go out, and have fun while I learn abit, I hope others have better experiences that. I doubt I'll be going back."}
{"text":"As this 4 this bbq place it sub-par brisket  was very dry and wasn't most like a fantastic brisket should be. The sausage had hardly no flavor the dishes where all right but could of be better."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch. I had the pulled pork and my husband had the brisket and it was all great! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Let's start with the food: Good ribs, good chicken, brisket is dependent on the day it seems. I'm a regular and have gotten fabulous brisket that is moist and smoky and also have had dry, tasteless brisket. The real treat in my opinion is the All-You-Can-Eat Fish Fry, served all day, every day.   Speaking of service, this place is phenomenal. The people are awesome and friendly and full of energy, and the live music every Friday is a hit. This place is always packed on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday night, and with the combination of service, food, and atmosphere, it's no surprise."}
{"text":"Stopped by Toms BBQ for lunch, I ordered the rib tips with curly fries and it was super yummy!!   The place was clean and the atmosphere was friendly.  It was pretty cool to use the bar code scanner on my new smart phone with the little review card I was offered that took me right to this link! Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Being a Native of Chicago I can say with most authority that this as authentic to Chicago cuisine as it gets, Tom's surly does the Chicago Style of Food justice."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I got food from here for the first time today. We got ribs, a pulled pork sandwich, a Chicago dog, and the Polish dog.  We also purchased sides of macaroni salad, BBQ beans, corn, and fried zucchini.  The ribs:                 These were very very dry and rubbery. The BBQ on it tasted like we were eating the ashes of a bonfire pit. There was way too much liquid smoke in the BBQ, unfortunately lingering forever in our mouths....even after a couple of glasses of whiskey.  The pulled pork:                   This was no better. The pork was not mixed with the BBQ like pulled pork normally is. The bottom of my bun was so soggy that it basically turned back into dough. The BBQ sauce itself was also not up to par, it didn't taste like a bonfire, but there was definitely not enough on the sandwich and it was really bland to almost the point of no taste.  The sides:                  The macaroni salad was dry as hell and the noodles were not cooked all the way. There was hardly any dressing on it and it looked like it had been sitting around for a couple days.                     The fried zucchini looked good from the outside until you bit into it. It was straight mush- like it had been squeezed to a pulp.                    The corn was also disgusting. It was definitely in a steamer (or pot of water) for way too long. Like the zucchini, the corn kernels were mushy.                     The BBQ beans were the only good factor of our meal. The BBQ sauce could have used a little more in spices and herbs- but it was good.  The dogs:                    Have not eaten these yet. But how can you mess up a hot dog? But from what we have had so far, who knows?                     Read the reviews prior to visiting the restaurant and gave them the benefit of the doubt.  However, as a cook for 7 years, you can take it from me that this place is not worth the money."}
{"text":"This location of Tom's is like my \"Cheers\" go to place.  There is always a friendly smile waiting for you and a good vibe.  We are fond of their fish fry, and during the cold snap we had a few weeks back, my daughter and I stopped there on a chilly Friday night.  We were asked if it was okay to sit on the heated patio, as the inside tables were full.  Another couple also came after us and they were also seated outside.  The manager and waitresses surrounded us with heaters and warmers, but that night the wind was just not cooperating, and after all of their best efforts and attentiveness, it still was chilly.  The manager came out to our tables and told both parties that he would be taking 20% off of our bills to thank us for putting up with the inconvenience of being chilly!  I thought that was an awesome move, as we had agreed to sit there in the first place.  Still my go-to place for my favorites: fish fry, bbq rib tips, and nachos with pulled pork on homemade potato chips!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch and had an ok experience.  Lady running the counter was very nice.   Ordered a brisket lunch platter.  The menu pictured showed a nice pictures of a \"flat\" part of a brisket.  Also had a side of Jalapeno Mac & Cheese.   When I got my food, the brisket was obviously from the \"point\" part which most bbq places use for burnt ends.  Very fatty, think chuncks.  Nothing like the picture and anyone who likes brisket knows the difference in the cuts (like order a filet and getting a strip steak - not the same thing).  Flavor was good on the brisket, just too fatty from the wrong cut.   Jalapeno Mac & Cheese was good and I'd get that again. BBQ sauces were on the sweet side but I thought both were decent to good.  I'd go back but only if desperate for BBQ and can't get to some better choices in chandler/gilbert."}
{"text":"Ok this was my first time here. I went in and ordered for to-go and the place looked clean.   I ordered half a rack of ribs and it came with 2 sides so I decided to go with the Jalapeño Mac and Cheese and Jalapeño Corn bread. The ribs come with optional reg bbq, mild or spicy sauce I like spicy and it was good everything I ate had a little kick to it. It also came with a complementary diner roll which was nice and soft.  The ribs here aren't the fall of the bone kind of ribs. It seemed more dry and requires more work to get the meat off the bone and for $17 after tax it seemed over priced.  Overall I was craving bbq that was conveniently located by work and this place suffices.   4 stars for the Jalapeño Mac and Cheese and corn bread!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night. Awesome chicken smoked BBQ sandwich and cornbread is delicious. Service was excellent, people were very nice even though I didn't know what I want and took some time to order. Place is clean, free refills on drinks. Will be back"}
{"text":"Just OK  I have been here twice and it is OK  I cannot say it is great or exceptional or that it is bad...   It is just alright...  The bathroom was tricky to find behind a hidden door! Funniest part of eating there!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch! Food was great and not too pricey! Would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere...great food... Even offered us a free piece of fried fish! Fish fry on Fridays! Everything was great! Small area is outdoors with corn hole games and music... Just a great place!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch. I ordered the ribs and my daughter got the mac and cheese. The ribs seemed reheated or just not prepared that well. They were a little tough and had that not made today taste. The BBQ beans I got as a side were very good though. I got the mild sauce on the side which had a heavy cinnamon taste to it, which I did not care for very much.  My daughters mac and cheese was spicy. It is not labeled as such on the menu. The waitress said it comes that way as it is a nacho cheese sauce. It tasted like it had jalapeños in it. If your kid has sensitive taste buds, steer them away. The waitress did offer to give her something new. She had got us chicken tenders, which took a while, but my daughter enjoyed them very much.  The biggest complaint I had was the amount of flys at our table. Make sure you bring a fly swatter!"}
{"text":"It was alright. We did takeout. Waited inside the restaurant, the atmosphere was definitely lackluster. Felt a little cheap. What I really care about is the food... which unfortunately, was just OK.  Ordered the pulled pork and the brisket, neither really tasted fresh. The BBQ sauces were awesome, however.  I'd give it another shot, but won't go out of my way for it."}
{"text":"I love this place, they should open a location on the West side of Phoenix then I could enjoy their food on a more consistent basis! I Love It!"}
{"text":"Worse bbq ever.  I ordered the pulled pork sandwich which tasted like the smell of a cigarette. I also ordered the regular Mac and cheese which was just cheese out of a can with no salt or flavor. Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"All in BBQ sampler will change your life. Smoked chicken was my favorite. Brisket was delicious. Pulled pork was juicy. Hot BBQ sauce was a great condiment. Potato salad was some of the best I have had. Beans were tasty. Awesome BBQ joint!!"}
{"text":"Tried the Chicago style Italian sausage was pretty good I'm gonna try the beef next time my son had their brisket it looked awesome he said it tasted good with the green beans french fries were good too I always have to have my french fries crispy and they were perfect"}
{"text":"I love this place! I stop by for to go orders often. The food is great and the people are very friendly! I love the ribs and my husband loves the  Italian beef sandwich."}
{"text":"I love their catfish sandwich , the ladies are always friendly and they love to see my dog when she comes with me . I always order to go and it's always ready  & fresh. The catfish dinner is always crispy and fresh! Their bake beans are very tasty! They have a reward point system that's also good and doesn't require an annoying punch card to keep track of. I've already earned a free meal ! I love this place !"}
{"text":"I was recommended to come here by a coworker, I got the fish & chips minus the chips$ 8.99 .  lol , I prefer coleslaw. Everything was seasoned well , the 3 pieces of fish were small but tasty. The fish were fillets, that's cool too . Back home in Maryland, we like fish bone in , with a crispy, crunchy tail to nibble . Hey I'm in the desert, it's not like it's any rivers or lakes near by. All in all everything was good ."}
{"text":"What an amazing place with great charm!!! Billie helped us feel so welcome and the food was amazing. Made fresh to taste as good or better than home cooking. That batter is the best!!! Yum!"}
{"text":"I have been a Tom's BBQ fan for a few years. The food is good, the best I've ever had? Probably not, but definitely up there on my list. Besides BBQ, one thing that is way above average is the fish, simply top notch. But here's the real reason (besides great food) I keep coming back, It's the service. The servers bust their asses here, they make sure your experience is a good one. Even the manager, he greets people personally and checks on you. At Tom's, you can rack up points to use towards your bill. I forget about it sometimes, but my server always reminds me about the points and if I want to use them. Yes sir, the food is very good, but the service is the main reason I keep coming back."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere and the hands on attention by the staff and proprietor! Tasted much of what was offered with a family of six and everything is good! Couldn't find a bad item! Bonus points for the bar!"}
{"text":"I'm originally from Illinois so when I heard about this place, I was super excited. The food was delicious for sure, the catfish was amazing. The hot link dinner was good, wish there was more bread that came with it. The most disappointing part about this experience was the peach cobbler, all it was is a cup of peaches in the juice with cinnamon or between sugar. I wasn't very happy. Overall, good experience. Dessert was disappointing."}
{"text":"After wasting too much time not stopping at Toms BBQ, we finally decided to stop today and give it a shot...it is clearly some of the best that I tried. The brisket was thick sliced, very delicious smoky flavor very moist...the Cole slaw was nice and was very creamy and flavorful. The mashed potatoes were amazing! These were definitely not instant, great texture and just the right amount of garlic taste! The fish platter was amazing huge portions on all for a great price! We were greeted with a smile from the lady at the counter and we got the pleasure of meeting Brenda the owner who was a delight and friendly! This is some amazing BBQ and we will be back! Keep it up Toms!!!"}
{"text":"I've been going here since I was little. Hands down, the best BBQ in AZ (in my opinion.)   I've had just about everything on their menu and they've never disappointed me. The service is great as well. :)"}
{"text":"I go to Toms often the food is good. But the service is very good. Billie the manager cares for all of the customer very good."}
{"text":"I was in the area and decided I would check this place out. Let me just say this, the time to go to this place is around 3PM because you will get treated like a king (or in my case, a queen! :)  I didn't really know what to order, so many choices, and Billie working behind the counter gave me several suggestions. I  go with the smoked turkey sandwich and red beans & rice for my side. She let me sample the beans before I got them (just to make sure they weren't too spicy). When I sat down, she asked if I would like a sample of the pork. Of course I do!! And damn I should have ordered the pork because it was delicious! The smoked turkey was good too just not like the pork. The BBQ sauce they put on too is sweet and yummy!!   As I'm eating, Billie and another staff member come out and talk to me for about 20 minutes. Both are really cool, laid back people and enjoyed having some company (as I went in alone). The entire time I was there, nobody else came in so it was fun talking to the staff. Just want to point out they do get slammed for lunch and dinner but since 3PM on a Thursday is an odd time to eat, they weren't busy.   Definitely loved this place and will be returning!!"}
{"text":"Service is personable and great! Food is even better! Our office will be returning often!"}
{"text":"Very friendly service. We arrived and placed our orders and it did not take long at all before we had our food at the table. I got the brisket with spicy barbecue sauce ,corn bread ,fries and finished it off with pecan pie. It was all very good. Everybody was very happy with their meals. We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Simply some if the best BBQ ive had in a while!  The chicken is incredibly tender and holds that smoky taste well.  Kick ass new sauces for anything you order!"}
{"text":"GROSS!!! Worst bbq I ever ate, the sides I got was green beans and Mac and cheese, the green beans would be better cold out of a can, and the Mac and cheese is paste with can cheese dumped on it.  People were friendly but the food I threw the sides away and ate part of the meat,"}
{"text":"I ordered a smoked turkey for Christmas and it was great, looking forward to getting one for Thanksgiving!"}
{"text":"They have so many tasty bbq options as well as the famous hot dog...the sauces are amazing! The pulled pork, house sandwich, and ribs are so tasty!"}
{"text":"Ordered the rib tips lunch special. Good flavor but a bit fatty and need more bbq sauce.  The coleslaw was creamy and good. The bun was fresh.  We also ordered the chicken special. Good chicken but again needed more bbq sauce. The next meal was the pulled pork sandwhich which they put coleslaw in the sandwhich too. Again need more bbq sauce. The macaroni  was reheated. Didn't taste good.  Maybe if it was fresh it might have. They need to wipe down the seats not only the table tops. Quite filthy."}
{"text":"I love stopping here for lunch on my home from red mnt mcc campus. Their pulled pork sandwiches are delicious, as are the sides. Fun atmosphere and always quick."}
{"text":"Carolina style pulled pork sandwich was SO good. And the jalapeño mac n cheese burned my face off in the best way possible. I just moved from Kansas City and it's good to know I can find good BBQ here in AZ."}
{"text":"The ribs here were disappointing to say the least. The sauce was not good they were chewy and just plain gross. The tiny pathetic corn on the cob was not fresh but frozen. Will not return."}
{"text":"Save your money. The brisket was average. The pulled pork was not good. The mashed potatoes were dry, lumpy and not good tasting. The Mac and cheese was awful and had a tin taste? The cheese is fake, not good. The biscuits they give you come in a plastic bag from the grocery store. They are Aunt Hattie's potato biscuits. Overall just not tasty at all. There was no homemade flavors. It was bad."}
{"text":"I had out-of-town guests who wanted some BBQ.  The staff was very nice, helpful and friendly.   I had fish and chips as it was recommend, \"We pack the house\" on Fridays.  Options were \"white fish\" or \"catfish\", I like both but selected the whitefish.  I don't know what I got but it was soft like catfish but didn't taste like it. I've never had anything like it and I wouldn't have it again.  Another had shrimp, rubbery.  The two that we brought here for BBQ commented it was overly smokey.  I noticed the cornbread came in a plastic wrap.  It wasn't horrible food but all of us agreed we'd scratch this place off the list."}
{"text":"Not a good experience. The lemonade was so watered down that my kids couldn't drink it. And unless you pay extra for \"a double\", you're gonna get a measly meat to bun ratio that makes their sandwiches almost inedible.   We were over charged for our meal, and even after we pointed it out, the revised total still didn't seem to add up. We ordered 2 sandwich combos ($11ea), a shrimp dinner ($14) and a kid's ribs meal ($7). Total should be ~$46.50 with sales tax. But we were charged $50 even?  Sketchy."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Having just moved from Illinois it was nice to see some Chicago influences. Food is amazing and the owner is extremely friendly, almost like a spastic mother-like figure. Awesome BBQ and the pulled pork is on point!"}
{"text":"I love going to Tom's for either their fish or the italian beef.  Their italian beef is as good as I can get going home to Chicago.  I get it dry with sweet peppers.  I get juice on the side so I can drown it as I eat it and not have it fall apart.  The fish is light, flavorful and not greasy.   My husband is from Texas and always looks forward to the brisket.    Zuchini and onion strings are our favorite sides.  The rice and beans were good too."}
{"text":"Had the brisket from the pig rig in Fountain Hills last night.Worst food I ever ate in my life!! When you order an overpriced brisket dinner you expect BRISKET SLICES \"not\" CHOPPED UP Brisket. I've had the brisket sandwich from there before and it was SLICED every time I ordered it.When you want to serve OLD brisket,you CHOP it up into little pieces and cover it with sauce...Disgusting!! But hey,you offered it for a whole dollar cheaper than you normally charge.Please don't come back to Fountain Hills to peddle your OLD brisket!"}
{"text":"Kind of a hidden gem in Chandler. Barbecue as good as Joe's Barbecue in Gilbert without the hassle of driving to Gilbert, looking for parking, and then standing in a long line.   My husband ordered the chicken. Loved it! Tender and moist. My daughter ate the pulled pork sandwich (2 days in a row), and I got the brisket. No fat on the brisket, which appeals to me.   If you haven't been, give it a try. Sign up for their frequent diner program while you're there cuz I guarantee you'll be going back!  Dine in or carry out. Quick service, too."}
{"text":"Food was very good!  Service was just decent.  No question about it, I will be back because it was delicious."}
{"text":"Food is so fresh, the bread buns, the hand breaded fish, the pulled pork, the chilly side dish and a crispy chicken sandwich, all so fresh. No heavy breading, no high salt content and not greasy. When the kids saw the French fries, The comment was, \"the fries are so fresh, my day just got it from a real potato\"! At the sameQuality level of the food, the price it's excellent. It is gourmet food at a fast food priceEat in environment it's very good. Although we have to leave and we use Take out. We plan to be there again the next day."}
{"text":"Soooo disappointed today.  This is my 3rd time going since we discovered this place and was always happy UNTIL today.  I ordered the three meat combo and had ribs, brisket and rib tips.  See photo the brisket appears to be left over pieces and very dry!!  The other times I ordered them they were nice whole slices of tender meat.  The rib tips were also what felt like left over pieces.  Ribs not shown because they were good and already eaten them.  I'm going to give this place one more chance but if I have this experience of inconsistency again....sorry Tom but I'll remove you from my BBQ options."}
{"text":"Had Friday all you can eat fish.  The fish and service was great!  Crispy, tasty and not greasy at all.   The only reason they didn't get 5 stars is because they only had 1 bottle of Malt Vinegar, no Tobasco (they did have Louisiana sauce, though), and I didn't like the Tartar Sauce that much.  My daughter liked it, however.  Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"This place is okay. I give it three stars only because the catfish and pulled pork are amazing dishes. Also, the tar tar sauce is bomb.  The set back I have when ordering is that the fries are just not up to par, they are greasy and flimsy. Plus, the mashed potatoes can be crusty in places.. The sides need some serious tweeking to be honest. I'm gonna be blunt here.  To continue, the BBQ is not wow. It takes a lot to make me amazed with BBQ here since I lived in the Midwest. It's good but eh.  Other than that, the actual entrees are pretty good. My parents order here a lot because of the above-average service.  All in all, it ain't bad. Just watch out for excess grease."}
{"text":"I am an admitted Chicago snob. Lots of places like to say they make Chicago hot dogs (Sonic? Please.) or authentic Italian beef, but many of them don't live up to their boasts. Well I'm glad to say Tom's BBQ was good enough for me to return.  We had a variety of foods, which for the most part were great.  The mac n cheese balls were not fabulous (they were cold in the middle) but came with a great gravy, full of spicy tomato flavor.  We had ribs, pulled pork, and buffalo wings from the BBQ side of the menu, and Italian Beef and hot dog from the Chicago side. My only quibble was that they used a stacker pickle instead of a kosher spear on the hot dog.  Other than that, everything was tasty and filling.  It's casual and fun, the service was friendly and relaxed, and the beer was CHEAP. I'd definitely come back here on my next trip to AZ. (Oh yes, this was a trip here to visit family... I chose to visit here in July just in time for the 4th hottest day in AZ history. I am insane.)"}
{"text":"My run tips was extremely salty I could not even eat it... I loved seasoned food but this tastes like someone accidentally poured the whole bottle. My husband ordered fried catfish and it was pretty good all tho I don't eat seafood"}
{"text":"Excellent food in a store that makes you think you're in Chicago. The entire menu is is great, but my favorite is the Pulled Pork Tom's House Sandwich (it also comes in brisket and chicken) which comes with grilled onions and mushrooms, mozzarella, house sauce, and peppers. Their two BBQ sauces are excellent, and I add that to the house sandwich myself."}
{"text":"The moment you wished you would have stuck with your go too pulled pork sandwich but, the all you can eat rib tip tempted you over the edge lol. Not terribly impressed with anything I had on this trip. If you like pulled pork don't feel tempted by your eyes, think about your stomach too. Just in case your like me and your eyes are bigger than your stomach."}
{"text":"Average BBQ not bad but wouldn't go out of my way to do it again. The food was ok the value was fair but nothing makes me want to do it again. Average"}
{"text":"This Toms was recommended by a co-worker and I've gotta say... I'm SUPER disappointed. We got there at 8 pm and the grill was off so my son and his girlfriend didnt get to order what they wanted. Sign says they close at 9 So shouldnt the grill be on to ensure customer satisfaction until 9 pm? Then at about 8:15 an older gentleman walked in and told the girl behind the counter that he was waiting for a few friends and her response was, \"we close in 15 minutes.\" AGAIN the frigging sign say 9 effing PM, NOT the grill at 8 and doors at 830.  Now for the food. The fried pickles were ok but,: the hot links and brisket were old and dry and the fries were cold. For the amount of money we spent, lack of respect for the customers, and the shear lack of quality of the food, i would never suggest this place to anyone"}
{"text":"Was a bit nervous going here after seeing the mixed reviews.  Went tonight with my roommate and we were both very pleased!  Restaurant set-up is simple and decor is all new-looking.  Staff was very nice and helpful even though the main employee seemed very frazzled since it was a bit busy - he was still very kind and attentive!  Food came out within 5-10 minutes of placing our order and was brought directly to our table rather than having to go back up to the counter to get it.  I got the rib tips dinner with corn on the cob and cole slaw.  The portion was absolutely huge - I needed help to finish it!  Cole slaw was creamy with just the right amount of mayo and the corn was sweet and not overly buttered.  This was my first experience eating rib tips and I was not disappointed.  The pork was tender and had phenomenal flavor.  It was not excessively fatty as some people have said.  The sauce was very tasty - sweet and brown sugary but with a little tang.  My roommate had the pulled pork sandwich with the spicy sauce and the baked beans.  He loved it all and raved about the baked beans.  Desserts looked good but we were way too full.  Overall, I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This is a updated review I posted back on 8/1/2013  We hear all the time that Tom's BBQ is a great place. My wife now and I decided to give this place a second try with the hope of maybe service, food, management, has changed.  Service, food, and the atmosphere of the restaurant was great. Last time my wife and I went, the restaurant was dead and service was terrible. There was a huge difference on our second visit. Don't know what happen and don't care what happened but we had a great experience.  The wife and I ordered pulled pork sandwiches. Ordered a basket of curly fries wasn't greasy like the last time. Very tasty and filling. Definitely recommend it. Pecan Pie is tasty as well.  Presentation of our dishes were awesome. Our server was great. Pricing on the food is fair and portion of food served is awesome.  Definitely will recommend this place to get some good grub with the hope that no one will ever have the experience I had when my wife and I went."}
{"text":"Love this place. Billy at the front always makes it a great experience. Some of the best BBQ ribs I've ever had. Reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh DELICIOUS BBQ! My boyfriend and I split the sampler for 26 bucks and it was enough to feed four. The Spicey BBQ sauce I could drink it's so good. Jalepeno cornbread on point. All meats (we had pulled pork, Spicey links, ribs, chicken) were smokey and delicious.  We are for sure going back!"}
{"text":"Just microwaved meat. All reheated. No flavor. No traditional BBQ taste. What's even the point?"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. I placed take out order. The food was cold, the zuccini was so greasy it dripped through the two bags it was packaged in, the cold slaw was dry . The Bbq chicken was inedible, looked like pre-packaged food warmed up. The brisket was tough. I ate some of the rib tips on my 3 meat dinner combo and the fries but everything else is terrible."}
{"text":"Every time I go it gets better!  The waitresses are funny and friendly and the place is perfect for family dining.  The leftovers (which need to be properly labeled so no one steals your food) are just as good the next day.  Make sure you take some extra BBQ sauce with you!"}
{"text":"I've had minimal experience with BBQ, so I ordered the burger. It had great flavor and I was happy with it. My boyfriend enjoyed his pulled pork as well. However, it seemed like it was a bit over priced for the quality. It was obvious his pulled pork had been sitting in a warmer for a few hours. The curly fries were undercooked and too greasy. The mushrooms my boyfriend ordered were not impressive either. Good potential but not quite on the mark."}
{"text":"This place is great. Anything BBQ from this place is amazing. Meat is soft and tender and the sauce is just perfectly sweet. We ordered the BBQ platter, pulled pork sandwich, fish and chips, and 3 drinks for about 40 dollars. Which isn't too bad because the food quantity is a lot!! The fish and chips from here isn't too bad, it's a lil bit on the salty side but I ain't complaining. Will definitely come again!"}
{"text":"Definitely the best bbq!! Prices are good, they're fast and VERY good. Everything is homemade. The people are so friendly. You can get anything here and not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The brisket and barbecue beans are great!  Wasn't a fan of the red beans and rice or the rib tips."}
{"text":"Service was very polite and quick. Food was really good!  We had Brisket i had spice my wife had mild.we both were very satisfied.  My side was BBQ beans they were OK my had Potato Salad that was great!  Would difently recommend."}
{"text":"I've been going here on and off for the past 14 years, more or less whenever I happen to be in this part of Tempe.  I suppose its a good thing that I always think of this place whenever I'm in the area, but that may be more of a case of \"better the devil you know.\"  From 96-2000, it was pretty much my reliable go-to place for BBQ.  Gotta love the diverse menu and creative combos, I believe that any BBQ fan can find their particular craving among the robust options.  Dollar-wise, I find Tom's to be quite kind.    Meats range from average to above-average to near-exceptional, with the brisket being the most reliably above-average meat for me.  The regular beef burger and rib tips might also warrant a consistent above average or even 4-star rating as well.  Ribs, chicken, dogs and fish - I've tried them all at one time or another - are all ok, albeit underwhelming.    Sides are ok, across the board.     Overall, I'd definitely recommend this place given how far you would have to drive to find something reliably better.  I suppose once you try a few different menu items, it is perfectly plausible to order a 4-star meal every time once you learn what to avoid.  The value is definitely there, so I figure its a venue worth a few of your trips."}
{"text":"Howdy-  this is going to be an honest review.  Went to Toms BBQ in late Dec 2017 for some brisket.  Ordered a brisket dinner..  $17.00 for meat and two sides..  brought it home with eager anticipation of chomping on some brisket.  Opened up the container and to my surprise I was given fat with a side of brisket!!  Not good folks.  I repeat negative ghost rider!!  I paid 17.00 for pure fat.  There was maybe 15 grams of meat..  and the meat was smothered in sauce.  Not good."}
{"text":"The food taste great! I got the pork sandwich and the bbq sauce on it tastes delicious. The short hair woman took my order is nice and friendly! A little over priced in my opinion but the service and food was excellent"}
{"text":"Place is legit.  Not going to write three paragraphs and tell you how crunchy the fried zucchini were after a 3 mile drive home and how the fish sandwich and Italian beef were freaking beyond delicious.  I'm just going to say this is legit food.  Second time I've been in 10 days.  I'll keep coming back.    Ps peach cobbler made me tear up a little, was like a hug from the grandma I never knew."}
{"text":"Very busy place on a Friday night. Service was quick. Fish fry was ok. Onion straws were dry. Pulled pork sandwich was ok.  Fries Nothing special. Not as fabulous as I would have expected considering the crowd. Didn't allow use of restaurant.com discount on weekend so we'll have to go back. Will try something else next time. Something there must be really good. Just haven't had it yet."}
{"text":"Garbage service. Was on hold for 20 minutes on phone and i heard them joking in background. I still ordered food and picked up and it was cold. NEVER coming here again. Management needs to look at the type of workers he hires. Is he running a circus cause he sure hs clowns tuning the show"}
{"text":"Not the BEST BBQ I've ever had but pretty good!! Its conveniently located right across the street from my work so its a good, quick lunch. Got the pulled pork sandwich and it was yummy, the bread its sort of different, its like buttery? I wish I was hungry enough to try some of the sides!! Will update this review when I go back & try some."}
{"text":"Pulled pork sandwich was the best!! Didn't really even need sauce tbh. Pretty busy for Thursday lunch time but didn't have to wait long for the food. Very clean. Nice music, not too loud and on a good station. Owner very friendly and really cares about this place!! Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"This place has really great meat that's consistent visit after visit. To me, the meat seems a little too sauced ...but it may be because the consistency and quality of the meat is so outstanding that I'm hesitant to sauce it at all for fear of hiding some of the deliciousness :) The brisket and ribs are my favorites, but in my experience you can't go wrong with anything on the menu! This is absolutely the best BBQ place I've found in Arizona."}
{"text":"Out of this world!! Billie would oversees it for Tom such a hostess.  She made our 1st visit one to remember!  She made sure our therapy dog had food and eater.  Besides the food being out of this world and fresh, she is such a joy to visit.  Our trip was one we won't forget and this is a place we are called family and feel right at home.  They run specials every day.  You must try this place first and foremost!! Thanks Billie!"}
{"text":"Had a pulled pork sandwich, which I enjoyed, although I wouldnt say it was amazing enough to make me drive back from my Gilbert home for another visit. I didnt think they had put enough sauce on the sandwich, but that was an easy remedy because they have big bottles of their sauce on every table (right next to the rolls of paper towels).   The service was great- the girl at the counter was very friendly and had a discussion with my boyfriend about half the menu which helped in his decision (dont worry, we went at a non-rush time, so we weren't holding up a line of customers).  :)"}
{"text":"Generally when I'm craving BBQ I think of Toms right away- always been a fave of mine. I had the pulled pork sandwich, which comes topped with a bit of their house coleslaw; I'm not a fan of coleslaw whatsoever but makes a good touch to the sandwich.   Like Amy said below they have big bottles of their sauce (mild and hot), at the table and tend to get a lil happy with the hot bbq sauce, I have problem lol. Also keep in mind the curly fries are meant to be shared they are a HUGE order but sooo good."}
{"text":"I am amazed how many times we've passed this little gem on McKillips and never stopped until this week. Food was wonderful....brisquet was moist, juicy and plenty of it,  ribs were fall-off-the-bone tender.  Then after we were done we were presented with a piece of their succulent fish to try...yummy! Huge portions and great sides.  Better food than a well known BBQ joint in Chandler we usually go to, but this was much closer to home and better food. Good price for what you got. Can't wait to return!  Oh, and hand cut fries to die for if you like fries!!"}
{"text":"Love eating here anytime.   Even their fish is as good as their friendly service. Fridays are busy come early. Cody and Chloe are our favorites. BBQ AND SIDES ARE GREAT.  Also good bbq nachos during Happy Hour are just $6.00!  They even cater!  Love Chloe too."}
{"text":"Clean and friendly bbq joint with generous portions.  I ordered the meaty half slab, beans and slaw.  The sauce was not my favorite, but the ribs were tasty.  Priced right.  I'll return to try their pulled pork."}
{"text":"Definitely worth a try for quick and delicious BBQ! I stopped by for lunch midweek and service was real quick. You order at the counter and can seat yourself and the food is delivered once ready. The best part of Tom's is the family feel to it. Ill definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This is some of the the most shockingly bad food I've had in a really long time. Now I'm from Texas so maybe my bbq standards are too high, but everything was terrible. We got the bbq meat sampler and there was nothing I wanted to take two bites of. The ribs were fatty and flavorless, the chicken rubbery, the pulled pork was swampy. The bbq sauce was too sweet and none of my family liked it. The high point of the meal was the rolls. I will never go back here. I wish I could go back in time and eat somewhere else. The bathroom was gross as well. I will say that the cashier was nice."}
{"text":"So I have lived in Mesa 4  years now. Not sure why I haven't been to this restaurant before now. Great service and my fish and chips were awesome. Good atmosphere and I'll definitely bring the kids next time:)"}
{"text":"This food was so bland no flavor at all and the chicken taste smoked and broiled not bbq at all this is the worst things that i have eating since i been here dont waste you money"}
{"text":"Ordered beef brisket dinner with red beans and rice and macaroni salad.  First thing I noticed when I walked in was little smoke was in the restaurant, not sure if that's a good thing.  Ordering was quick and took my dinner back to the hotel.  Opened it up noticed how much sauce was on the brisket,  taste was okay.  I think they use oak for the smoke,  I could be wrong.  The brisket had very little smoke,  no smoke ring that I could see.  Overall, just okay BBQ.  I did like the hot BBQ sauce.."}
{"text":"We gave toms BBQ another whirl last night and I'm so glad we did . I had a chopped beef Sammy , my bf had pulled pork and a side of mashed potatoes .we shared a combo basket of fried pickles , zucchini & mushrooms it was to die for yeah!! We will definitely keep this place in the weekend restaurant rotation  Came back tonight for dinner- even better than the last time"}
{"text":"Tom's BBQ is good. I am a fan of the pulled pork sandwich. Not a big fan of the Chicago style hot dog. I am a true midwest girl and I like a nice snap to my hot dog. I did not get that at Tom's. I did however get a nice sweet but smoky sauce with a very tender pulled pork on a soft bun. The mac and cheese was just okay. Cole slaw is good.  I would like to try in the future the pulled pork nachos as well as the Italian beef sandwich with hot peppers. Service was wonderful. The nice lady at the counter gave us suggestions on what to order on our first visit and was very welcoming. Overall I had a good first impression of Tom's. I will be back."}
{"text":"It was okay, there meat was the best thing but the sides aren't good and there fried zucchini needed to be smaller"}
{"text":"Tender meat and great sauce!  Homemade sides and desserts!  I always order the same thing - pulled pork, cole slaw, corn on the cob.  Tasty tasty goodness.  Plus, if Billie is working, you are guaranteed to laugh the entire visit."}
{"text":"I want to start by saying the lady who took our order was really nice and friendly. Honestly, though, I've been here a couple times before and don't know why I went back. I just wanted a good pulled pork sandwich and some mashed potatoes. The meat itself was good but the sauce was lacking in flavor and gritty somehow. The mashed potatoes seemed like they were maybe half (if not all) instant and half...canned garlic? I know it's fast food but I expected more from a place that boasts so much about the authenticity of their BBQ. I would have been happier going to an actual fast food place. My husband got a fish dinner plate. The fries were soggy and the fish was rubbery. I wish I ordered the Italian beef instead since this is a Chicago-themed establishment... Unfortunately I will not be back to try it."}
{"text":"We live in the neighborhood and decided to try this place. the only thing I can say is go to McDonalds or any place else. The food was terrible. The french fries were so bad they went in the trash. All you could taste was grease and BBQ sauce. One of the worst dinners I've had in a long time."}
{"text":"Been in Az for 8 years and have had a hard time finding BBQ like back home (Texas/Oklahoma)....came here on a whim and don't regret it. The BBQ sauce is a little sweet for my taste but was still really good. This is my second favorite BBQ place in the metro. Toms BBQ will be my go to for the nights I need a BBQ fix without a long wait. Yummmm!!!!"}
{"text":"Not the best but not the worst. My family has come here a few times, as we live fairly close by and the service is never good. The food is just mediocre, and I really don't recommend the ribs. The only thing truly commendable about this place is the pulled pork which we were surprised by how good it was. We might come back here and give it another chance with some of the other dishes."}
{"text":"We love Tom's BBQ for the fried fish on Fridays. We have been frequent flyers for years. Visiting mainly the Ocotillo and Tempe location. Tonight was the absolute worst experience we have ever encounter with Tom's BBQ, let alone any establishment.   We called ahead to place an order for 20 pieces of fish and a large order of jalapeño Mac n cheese. The lady on the phone asked if we'd make it within the 20minutes until 9pm which is closing time and we expressed we would be there. Our order came to a total just shy of $70.   We showed up two minutes to spare to a locked door and three employees who ignored me at first; after a minute of persistence they acknowledged me in which we stated we were the call ahead order for pick up. They proceeded to shake their heads and tell us no, that they were closed.  We did not receive our food and little do they know, we drove over ten miles to get there and have a newborn at home. Needless to say it was not easy making it there in time in the first place and to be treated in such a way was appalling. I fairly doubt they made our order because why would they refuse us when we were on time? Not getting our food was not the worst part, it was the lack of customer care and the manner in which they addressed us. Never will we be customers at this location again.   We have driven to the McKellips location in which they are taking way better care of us. The Tempe location really needs an attitude check of their employees. My father owns a business and we would never want any of our customers being treated in such a way, let alone have anyone working for us whom treat others as such."}
{"text":"Stopped in because US Egg next door was too busy. We were welcomed by the woman working the cash register who actually met us at the door and welcomed us in since we got there right at opening. I got the Western burger and my boyfriend got the pulled pork, both were delicious and I was glad they had extra sauce out so we could have some on our fries. Great atmosphere, great food!"}
{"text":"During happy hour they have freshly made potato chips for a dollar. These are excellent. We have been here several times and everything has been above average. Service is good, they are short on ambience but the rest of the experience more than makes up for it."}
{"text":"I've driven by this place many, many times and never stopped in. I finally pulled the trigger and all I can say is I wish I'd tried it sooner. I had the Italian Beef with sides of jalapeño mac'n'cheese and BBQ baked beans and sampled the brisket while I waited for my order. I thought everything was absolutely killer, no complaints whatsoever. Looking forward to my next visit. $10 for the lunch special and I couldn't even eat it all-can't beat that."}
{"text":"Had the BBQ nachos from the Toms booth at the fountain hills art fair. Looked great, but the meat, cheese sauce and all other toppings were cold.  Service was bad, waited in line for 20 minutes, get to the register and the lady just walks away, telling everyone she was going in break and we should just go get in the next line.  Luckily someone with common sense stepped in and took orders in that line. Then he gave me wrong change and took 3 tries for him to get it right. $100-$14=$86.  Not $46. Not $94. Overall disappointing food, even for an outdoor food stand and just head shaking service."}
{"text":"Tried this place out with a Restaurant.Com coupon.  The food was quite good.  The brisket and pulled port were both solid with the pork being some of the best I've had in a long time.  I don't like the fact that they cover it in sauce but that's easy enough to rectify during my ordering next time.  The side dishes were good and they have daily specials ($9.99 pork dinner, etc).  For a filling lunch or a casual dinner, it's a great option.  The interior of the restaurant isn't very appealing but it'll do."}
{"text":"Not too bad...not that good. Ribs still had the membrane on the bottom, pulled pork was somehow moist and dry at the same time. I prefer Georgia Chopped pork style more, so maybe it's me. The brisket saved the day. A+ for the brisket! Cole slaw and beans were just ok.   Don't know if this is the best in the area...I will keep looking."}
{"text":"Really authentic barbeque. A friend of mine said he used to have a delivery job and one of his stops was this location. He said the walk-in refrigerators were always very clean, which always stuck with me and inspired me to try this place. I haven't ordered anything here that I haven't liked. Once, they put too much cheese on my Chicago beef sandwich, but I just picked it off. It was still an amazing sandwich. That was my worst experience here, haha."}
{"text":"Ordered the brisket, wife pulled pork. The brisket was very good and the sauce was even better.  the curley fries were better then the regular. The potato salad was probably one of the worse ive had. didnt have any flavor and i couldnt eat it. I ordered a Chicago dog and the toppings were top notch but the hot dog itself was bad, dont know if it had been sitting around all day or what."}
{"text":"We ordered takeout from this location for dinner.  We ordered the family BBQ bucket of pulled pork, mac n cheese and corn on cob.  The guy on the phone was very pleasant, however the food was not pleasant.  the pulled pork itself was pretty good, but the BBQ sauce was the strangest we've ever had.  It was extremely sweet, tangy and spicy...but just very odd and not edible. I could not finish the meat with the sauce on it...I almost got sick.  The mac n cheese looked appealing, however, it lacked flavor.  Very disappointing...everyone knows to make traditional mac n cheese, you need to use sharp cheddar, and this was mild cheddar and needed salt, and I am not one who adds salt to everything.  The corn on cob was disgusting - you could tell it was cooked from frozen, my mistake.  I should've known better than to order corn on cob - it was soggy.  I really wanted to like this place, but i think perhaps other items on their menu are better - the fish looked good and the hot dogs also...they are more a chicago style, and I am from the south where the BBQ is insanely awesome as well as the mac n cheese.  I really wish Chandler could get a great BBQ joint as I have not been to a good one yet."}
{"text":"Tom's didn't really do it for me. Ordered the brisket and found it to be was just too tough. Wasn't worth finishing. Didn't seem to really be much care in prepping the food. Left disappointed and still hungry. The french fries were good was the brightest spot. The tap water tasted liked it was dredged out of the canal. Lots of flies on the patio. Not sure they can do anything about that, but it doesn't help the overall vibe. Macaroni and cheese weren't very good. Just not much here to like, I thought the same as others they seem to be going for variety in their menu over quality (Chicago style food, fish and chips and BBQ, Oh My!) .Just my 2 cents.  Way way better BBQ elsewhere."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the worst $40 I've EVER spent and trust me I've wasted my fair share of mula! I ordered a brisket dinner with mashed potatoes and French fries and the mrs got the pulled pork combo with their Mac and cheese and corn on the cob. Right out the gate I was a bit concerned when not even 3mins after placing or order the gentleman was already coming out with our food. Normally I'd be excited about getting my food so promptly but in this case I wasn't. The server was very friendly which was great and everything we ordered arrived which was also nice. But that's where it all ended. Basically everything that came to the table was cold. Had it not been for luke warm bbq sauce that was on top I would have thought it all literally came out of the fridge! Tons of fat on the brisket and when I say it had no flavor I mean like ZERO! All of the sides left much to be desired! The mrs's pulled pork was just ok according to her but I tried a bite and didn't think it was good at all. I'm writing this review from my toilet thanks to the very unpleasant eating experience that I had at Tom's BBQ. After seeing so many of the good reviews I would have expected much better! Maybe it was just an off night but unfortunately my experience is enough for me to not come back here again! So much better bbq around the valley. Just have to travel out of your way a bit & spend a little extra coin!"}
{"text":"I asked the girl behind the register what there most popular BBQ is.  She told me that their Italian Beef was popular.  When I try a place for the first time I like to have their signature food, because if that is no good the rest will be even worse.  There was only one other group of people there but it was midday so that isn't always a sign of anything.  I got my sandwich fairly quickly which is to be expected for food that is already made.  That is when the experience went down hill.  Apparently they marinate their bread in Au Jus because it was overwhelmingly soggy.  I brought it back up and said it was very soggy, and she informed me they often put some juice on it.  That may be the case but a freshly made sandwich does not get soggy within a minute.  That leads me to believe it was already made before I got it.  I got a replacement one, hold the JUICE.  This time it was a normal sandwich and the new problem was that it had zero taste.  It was the driest most flavorless beef sandwich I've eaten before.  I think I also got some potato salad which was mediocre as well.  Overall, the worst BBQ place I've been too.  I'm not surprised because Chicago people can't do anything right.  They screwed up pizza and the hot dog.  Which makes me wonder, why are Chicago people obsessed with reinventing the wheel?  Good BBQ already exists, no need to Chicago-style it and make it bad.  Good pizza is from NY, no need to add a few pounds of soggy deep-dish dough to screw it up.  If you're hot dogs were so good, why do you hide it under so many condiments?  Rant over.  Note to self, avoid anything that Chicago stole from another region and tries to claim it."}
{"text":"Steer clear.  Not accommodating.  Ordered a pound of brisket...nice Smokey flavor, but the put the sauce on it instead of the side.  I asked for pickles to come with it...said they would have to charge for fried pickles.  Don't people eat BBQ with pickles?  The brisket was tough and fatty.  Totally not worth it.  Dillion's is WAY better and cheaper and they include pickles without attitude!"}
{"text":"The fried pickles are amazing. They're beef batter and sliced lengthwise and cooked perfectly. Their bbq sauce is very sweet so I usually go with the hot bbq sauce. I have yet to try something on the menu that I haven't enjoyed."}
{"text":"I have been driving past this place for over a year and kept telling myself I need to stop in there. Glad I finally did. The wife and I needed to eat and we got us some decent BBQ and it didn't cost a fortune. Recommend you try it if you're near 51st and Olive."}
{"text":"This review applies only to this location. Two of the Tom's BBQ places are owned by the father, and two are owned by the son. This location is owned by the father.  Companion and I have dined at this location a number of times, and we usually order the same thing each time.  Companion orders the chicken sandwich, jalapeno mac and cheese, a brownie and a drink. I usually order rib tips, cole slaw, and a drink. We have never been disappointed.  Companion's chicken was moist, and filled the entire bun. The Mac and Cheese had perfectly cooked al dente noodles with loads of cheese on them. The brownie was moist and perfectly chewy and chocolatey.  I order my rib tips without sauce as I prefer to taste the meat with just a little sauce in the background, and they always perfectly oblige my wishes. Their cole slaw is hard to beat; creamy and crunchy with excellent flavor.  Staff is always friendly and most helpful. They take all credit cards including  Amex.  At the risk of sounding prejudiced, this is my go to place for BBQ, and I do eat there fairly regularly. It is clean and relatively quiet. At holiday time you can have them smoke your turkey for you at a very reasonable price.   My only wish is that they would have smoked lamb. I once had a sandwich of it and thought I went to heaven, but that was some time ago.  4 stars for cleanliness, good food, nice sized portions, and wonderful customer service."}
{"text":"As a former Illinoian, this is a pretty good place to watch a Bear's game and enjoy some classic Chicago sandwiches. The Italian sandwich is super spicy and delicious and the au jus sauce was authentic. The baked beans were sweet, but soupy. Fries were freshly cut and Chicago style greasy goodness. My personal fav is the Beef Brisket sandwich with spicy BBQ sauce. It's perfectly cooked and the juices just soak into the bun.  The service was friendly and there are plenty of TVs to catch all the action. We'll definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"I stopped by on Monday and picked the Monday Special, pulled pork dinner with 2 sides and a roll for 8.99.  It was excellent! The service was fast and friendly.  I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"The service we received here tonight was outstanding! Billie, the manager became our \"best friend\" by the time we left! Great food, great conversation and laughs! Such a fun night. The rib tip dinner and beef brisket..WOW!!! Succulent!!!"}
{"text":"We have driven by here so many times and finally stopped today. What a good place for BBQ! It used to be a Pollo Loco chicken joint years ago. We were in on a Thursday at 2:30 and there was only another couple there. We ordered the Thursday special \"all-you/can-eat\" rib tips. They were very good. Tender with the right amount of smoke. The cole slaw was fresh, crunchy and good! The red beans and rice were spicy and you get a huge basket of fresh skin on French fries. The brisket was moist and tender with a good smoke ring and taste. Very friendly staff and service. I recommend it and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"A great surprise, wonderful food, great service and an incredible deal. When your there be sure to say hello to Bobbi, she's super friendly and will make your day!"}
{"text":"Wow! If you are looking for a change from the corporate, cookie cutter world and want a place they will remember not just your order but your name, look no further. Go to Tom's! We first came here on a whim and haven't been able to stop going back. The staff was so nice on our first visit and even let us sample some of the fish, that, is delicious! All the ladies that work here are sweet, unique and know customer service. We just love the bartenders pink boots, how the other girls wear flowers in their hair and have pizzazz. What a comfortable atmosphere, perfect for kids or having a cold one after work. Check out this place for great food, friendly people and a fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. First time - Italian Beef & Sausage Combo (by mistake), Maxwell St Polish  Italian Combo: I'd never had the combo anywhere before because I don't really love Italian Sausage (blasphemy, I know).  But when I got it home and bit into it, I'm glad they gave me the combo instead of just the beef.  I could tell that the beef sandwich alone would have been awesome - great tasting juice, tender beef, and all the right toppings.  The addition of the sausage didn't really improve the sandwich for me, simply because Ricobenes and Italian Beefs are my favorite things on baggies.  But it did make me realize that I do indeed like Italian Sausage sammiches.  The combo gave me two different experiences and neither overpowered the other, but came together to form an undeniably delicious sandwich.  Therefore, I recommend either the beef or sausage sandwich, or more importantly...the combo.    Polish: This is the Maxwell St...so its not just a regular polish you'd get at a cart somewhere on Central.  The grilled onions, mustard and peppers were all present on top of the familiar taste of that kind of sausage.  Hmmm...can't remember if it was a regular bun...drat.  Anyway, the ONLY problem was the sausage - it was a bit overcooked.  If it hadn't been, it would have been my first taste of a proper Maxwell St since Hippo's in Troy, MI.  Don't get me wrong, the taste was definitely legit here...just an unfortunate mishap on the sausage.  Went back yesterday as I was trying to avoid I-10 traffic.  This time I got the 2 Meat Combo with potato salad and red beans & rice.  Ribs and brisket were my meats.  Ribs - I have become a dry rub guy (seems like this review is filled with phrases that could be exploited), and I think the presence of an insane amount of sauce lessened my opinion of these ribs.  I like to judge a rib without sauce, but that was impossible because of how much they put on them.  Regardless, they were tender enough without being \"fake\".  However, they didn't have enough smokiness for my liking.  It was dark in the room, so I couldn't tell if there was a significant smoke ring or not.  All in all, you could do much worse.  But I think I'll probably pass on the ribs whenever I go back.  The Chicago offerings are much more intriguing.   Brisket - Can't complain whatsoever.  I haven't had a ton of brisket in my life, so maybe I don't know good brisket when I taste it.  But this was good to me.  A good smokey flavor, tender, and not crumbly or dry.  The sauce helped it a bit I think, as the two flavors work well together.  I would buy this again.  Probably the best I've had in my limited experience.  Da Sauce - Not bad at all.  In fact I prefer this over a lot of Famous Dave's sauces.  It has a tang to it, but not overpowering with it.  Its not a thick sauce.  It seems to not fit their ribs the best, though...its hard to explain.  Kind of a moppy sauce, but perhaps better on someone else's ribs.  Even still, I wouldn't mind having a bottle of it at home for my chicken or burgers.  Good stuff.  So yeah, this is a great place to come for some Chi-Town goodies.  They get the Italian Beef right, the taste of the Maxwell correct, and they also have some other good stuff I have to back and try.  I also gotta try their fried catfish - in fact, they have an all you can eat fish fry on Fridays.    Pricing was normal for this kind of food - about $7 for the sandwiches, $4 for the Maxwell, $16 for the 2 meat combo w/sides.  Not bad.  Service the second time was nice - a very personable and chatty lady was behind the counter and we had some nice conversation...very kind to replace my red beans and rice after i dropped it by saying good bye haha.  I recommend the place and i'm sure I'll increase the rating as I go back more."}
{"text":"I came to this location three separate times and out of all three of my experiences all three was horrible . The service was good but I was expecting great BBQ at this place . A staff member said the pull pork sandwich was the best item on the menu , so I tried it out since everyone else seem to be ordering it . When I looked at this sandwich it was drowned in BBQ sauce . The pull pork didn't have any taste what so ever . All I tasted was BBQ sauce . It had coleslaw in the sandwich which didn't have any taste ether . 6 dollars for sandwich with no taste nor flavor it not worth my time ."}
{"text":"Solid BBQ. This was a family favorite growing up. The slogan is bordering inappropriate which makes me love it all the more. The ribs are a must."}
{"text":"This is the nicest Tom's BBQ out of all the locations I've been to. It's quite spacious, with indoor and outdoor seating.  Ordering was easy at the counter, and the cashier was very friendly and engaging. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich combo with chili. It was made in lightning fast time- very nice! Sodas are self serve at the fountain, with iced tea as well.   The sandwich was a hearty portion of tender pork, coleslaw, and bbq sauce. With the hot and spicy chili, I was definitely full for lunch.  Definitely a good place for bbq if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"Amazing barbeque...  The best staff.  This is the spot for Chicago style BBQ!  The prices are decent and the location is always family friendly.  We will be long time customers for sure.  Give them a try next time you are on baseline and mill!"}
{"text":"One of my least favorite BBQ places:( I live in the area, and used to go here once a month or so. Every time I would order takeout, I would get home and find something wrong or missing in my order. Not to mention that it isn't cheap, but the quality of the food is below sub-par. I love a good BBQ pork sandwich, and this tastes like it came out of a plastic tub then microwaved. Not a $9/10 sandwich. The last time I ate here I got food poisoning, and that was it for me. I haven't been there in over a year, I would rather go to Taco Bell..."}
{"text":"GO!!!!  My husband and I just moved to the area and have been here twice. We have every intention of going back for thirds, fourths, .....  ;-)  Ok, to start off with, the service is always top notch. The host and servers are genuinely friendly and make you feel like they are glad you're there.   The main event...the food, is CRAZY good!  The first time we went we split a BBQ sampler for 2.  It was a great way to try a varitey of the meats, sides, and BBQ sauce.  The brisket, pulled pork, and  smoked chicked were juicy, flavorful and definitely something you'd crave to go back for!!!  The sides were got were baked beans, cole slaw, and mashed potatoes.  The baked beans are HEAVEN.  The flavor is insanely good and the BBQ sauce is perfect!  I will be craving these for sure!  The cole slaw and mashed potatoes were very good.  The second time we went, I got a grilled chicken sandwich with cheddar and bacon. Fresh, flavorful, fantastic!  My husband ordered a brisket sandwich and said it was very tasty.  The finale, I need to write about an item that is not on the menu but you HAVE to order it or you'll be missing out.  It's the fried macaroni and cheese!!!!!!!!!!   It comes as two balls (one of each of us) and is served atop some tomato sauce. OMG!!!!!!!!!!   This was a lunch time meal and by dinner and I was bugging my husband to go back for another order of the fried macaroni and cheese!  I seriously hope they add this to their menu permantly because it's FABULOUS!!!!!!!!  We've never had dessert here because we're always so full from the food but maybe some day.  ;-)   I do know we'll be going here a lot and are very happy it's in our neighborhood and so close by.  Keep up the great work, Tom's BBQ.  YOU ROCK BBQ!!!  Very happy customers in Chandler, Az J & D"}
{"text":"LOVE this place. Every time I come in from Chicago to Phoenix, I make a point of stopping in at Tom's to eat. I also pick up some of their amazing BBQ sauce to bring back with me to sweet home Chicago."}
{"text":"The main reason I ever go here is because they have fresh cut fries. Their food is so-so for me and the BBQ sauce is not very enjoyable. I always hope I am remembering the quality of the food wrong but end up being disappointed again."}
{"text":"Don't order fish at a BBQ place. I love the pulled pork but the fish I ordered was bland and under-cooked. I came home and put it in the oven for 20 minutes and it was cooked but still very flavorless. The fries looked and tasted like they were cooked in last month's oil. And the menu said the fish and chips come with cole slaw and hush puppies. They did not include this in my to go order."}
{"text":"I was craving a pulled pork bbq sandwich. Stopped in at Tom's, was greeted right away, ordered my sandwich to go and had it in less than 5 minutes. Got home opened the box and there was a great looking sandwich, lots of pork on a large fresh bun and just the right amount of bbq sauce. I asked for the cole slaw on the side and it was in a separate container so it didn't get my sandwich soggy.  The flavor and tenderness of the meat was great and the mild bbq sauce was just right. This place met all my expectations!"}
{"text":"The food is great, a little pricey but what BBQ isn't! I love the sauce and the service too. The location is great at Alma School and Queen creek. The place is always clean, and you never have to worry about parking.  They do great at carry out and always offer different deals around the holidays like smoking turkeys etc.   Love it!"}
{"text":"Really delicious and great service. I ordered the ribs that fell of the bone and my husband had the pull pork. The cashier/waitress was very friendly and funny. The meals are reasonably priced for the large portions."}
{"text":"Overpriced and over rated. Ordered the burnt ends sandwich to go. I was pretty disappointed when I got home and the sandwich had no burnt ends on it. What a joke. I won't be coming back"}
{"text":"good sauce and sides and a clean environment. the bbq was ok..i wasn't disappointed,  however i wasn't running to grab a pen and write home about it either."}
{"text":"The pulled pork with mild BBQ sauce good, Cole slaw good, slaw could be cut thinner for my preference.  However I gave them 3 starts because the cornbread is the WORST.  Also they do not sell white meat chicken bone in with skin on BBQ- thats just sad."}
{"text":"This is my kind of BBQ! We tried this place on a whim the other night and were pleasantly surprised. It's more of a Chicago style BBQ...smoked and slathered with sauce which is exactly how I like my BBQ! I had the sliced chicken sandwich with fries. The chicken was moist, the bun was good and the sauce was just the right combination of sweet and smoke. The fries were some of the best I've had anywhere. You could tell they were fresh cut (not frozen) and cooked to a perfect crisp.   My guest has a meat combo platter and commented that it was very good. He didn't like the baked beans much though...said they had too much sauce and not enough beans. Other than that, I'd say this restaurant has it right and we will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Lunch today at Toms Barbecue. This was my first time eating here. The food was awesome. Everything is homemade and fresh. The barbecue sauce had a really nice spicy kick to eat. I had the pulled pork sandwich and mac and cheese with jalepano's. I also sampled the fish which was delicious. The staff is awesome as well. I highly recommend Tom's."}
{"text":"Clean, friendly people but the food is nothing to write home about. The meats are only ok, the sauce is tasteless and they use way too much. Cornbread was microwaved and gummy. We won't be coming back."}
{"text":"They have ribs & chicken for $9"}
{"text":"They can never get a order right. Came in twice every time I come there's always a wrong order.  Hiring people with better hearing pissed I paid 20 and received something else!!"}
{"text":"I decided to give the place a second try after my last horrible experience.  I have been a customer for 15 years, but now no more. I was forced to wait to place my order while the counter person told a personal story to some people who had already ordered.  I waited at least three minutes before she acknowledged me and asked if I wanted to order.  She really didn't look like someone who should be behind the counter. improperly dressed, did not know the counter, did not upsell me etc.  The food was fast, but really no flavor.  Pulled pork was dry and not that tasty.  The hot sauce was spicy, and the onion straws were over seasoned.  I have given up on Toms.  Am looking for new BBQ in Phoenix.  Honey Bears is not it either, but that is a different story."}
{"text":"Definitely not what it was years ago. Walked into the place and it smells like a cesspool. 15.99 for an individual meal, are you serious? When I got home my bag was a puddle of sauce, obviously they don't know how to bag stuff. Customer service was great. But who cuts ribs across the bone and not along the bone? This was just odd."}
{"text":"Horrible. The best part about it was the Busch's Baked Beans. Disgusting and bland mac and cheese. Greasy pork. Dry brisket. Sausage that had a funky texture and gave me immediate heartburn. Sub-par fries that we had to smother in vinegar. Everything was doused in sauce. If you have great meat, you don't need to hide it under generic BBQ sauce. The rolls were so hard and I couldn't tell if the crap on top of it was flour (obviously store-bought) or mold. The woman who served us was somewhat inappropriate, though friendly. I didn't need to see her asscrack and thong, either. Horrible experience. Def won't be going back! $35 for two people and the vast majority of it got thrown away. The thong lady asked the table next to us 4 times how they were doing but never once asked us. I was so irritated and disappointed at that point, had she asked me, I would have been brutally honest. Save your money and your stomach and go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"We ate at Toms BBQ last night. I've been here before. The food is delicious.  I used to live near the owners and they always sponsored our neighborhood BBQ. So something suspicious happened here last night, that I have only seen on the TV show Restaurant Stakeout and this is it,  I went to the ladies restroom and when I threw away the paper towel there were some guest checks used to take orders in the trashcan.  It looked like some orders were thrown away.   Anyway this did not seem normal to me.  I went into detective mode and took a picture of them with my cell phone. Plus I kept them. I hope no employees are stealing from Tom.  Business is hard enough as it is without stuff like this going on."}
{"text":"Hadn't been to Tom's in years and I was in the area getting my car fixed and it was fantastic. They no longer have the curly fries on the menu I had remembered and I asked and they made them for me anyways! Portions were huge, bbq sandwich was great, I was very happy and wondered why I hadn't been in such a long time. I will be back soon. Sign up for their emails, they send out coupons."}
{"text":"We walked in the door at 8:30pm and the first thing that came out of the older lady's mouth behind the counter was \"You know we're closing in about 15 minutes\" and we said that was fine, we would order quick... She then asked if our order was going to be to-go and we said we would rather eat there and she sighed and went back to ask someone in the kitchen so we just walked out. By the time we walked out it was only 8:35pm and closing time isn't until 9:00pm! So here I am typing this at 8:45pm from SomeBurros next door. If you want to close up and get out by 9:00-9:30pm then maybe you should consider moving up your closing time. That's the first and the last time we will be visiting, unfortunately since the food smelled great!"}
{"text":"This place is growing on me. I usually eat here once a week as it's close by my job. It' no Joe's BBQ in Gilbert, but it's still really good. The owner and staff does a good job at being friendly and there are a lot of sides to choose from. The sign on the pink pig van in the parking lot says it's Chicago style BBQ. Tip: Take advantage of their rewards program. Points add up fast and I'm always getting free side dishes."}
{"text":"I would have gave them a 5 star but the bread was dry. I ordered the 2 meat dinner with a hot link, chicken, mashed potatoes, mac and cheese. It was yummy."}
{"text":"Tom and I moved to Arizona around the same time, and 've come to know the man, and love the food.  This is a perfect down home BBQ meal, tucked away in the mill town center.  Check out their other locations for great BBQ"}
{"text":"The counter lady is awesome..the food is absolutely wonderful and fast.....and affordable."}
{"text":"Sarah's my sister and we ate there together the other day .  I specifically asked for my beef to be extra extra juicy, with giardiniera...and it came out exactly as requested....enough so that I had to use a knife and fork to eat most of it.  The fries were really yummy too, and the service was fast and friendly.  Definitely not training table food, but an authentic and delicious taste of the homeland right here in Mesa, AZ.  We also loved the classic Chicago memorabilia on the walls and were tempted to try on the foam Bear hat on the cooler, but refrained...perhaps on our next visit???"}
{"text":"Fast-service BBQ places abound in just about every town and city, and they all deliver pretty much the same menu: BBQ brisket, pulled pork, chicken, sometimes ribs and burgers.  Tom's is the same.  Usually the ambiance is booths and plain tables-and-chairs.  Often you order at a counter and they bring you the food.  Tom's is the same.  Prices are usually a bit more than fast food but not as much as regular sit-down restaurants.  You guessed it - Tom's is the same.  But this Tom's has a problem.  Consider the brisket platter for about $10, which consists of brisket, a biscut, and a side.  What could be so bad?  Well, it was the brisket.  The portion consisted of about 3 ounces (maybe 4) of meat utterly covered in a sweet BBQ sauce -- not cooked with the sauce, just inundated with it.  Ok - scrape it off, you will suggest.  So I did.  What was underneath was small slices entirely from the fatty part of the brisket.  Half of my small portion of meat was fat, and not crispy tasty fat but soggy discouraging muck.  The pictures on the wall showed lots of lean slices from the first cut of the brisket -- misleading? or downright fraudulent?  Now I see why they put 6 ounces of BBQ sauce on 3 ounces of meat.  I notice that the rest of our group of six was eating their food, mostly, but without any outward signs of real pleasure.  That at least was comforting - misery loves company."}
{"text":"Had the 2 meat combo with brisket and ribs. My son had the chicken combo.  My son could not finish his as it was flavorless and dry.   My meal was the same.  $27.00 later I won't be going back."}
{"text":"The food and service was good. But when it came to my kids food we ordered her the kids macaroni and cheese. When it showed up to the table it looked good but it had jalapenos in it. So we asked the server to take it back and get her another one. She came back with the same one saying the owner just changed it up that all the macaroni and cheese going to have Jalapeno in it. She said that she didn't know that they did that . But she was very nice and offered her another Meal and took off the other one. So if you take your kids to eat there and they what the macaroni and cheese make sure to ask if it has jalapenos in it."}
{"text":"So this is the 3rd time I've been back since my first review and I've still got 5 stars for this place. Finally tried their ribs today. :::channeling Janice from Friends::: Oh. My. Gawd. So, so good!!! The jalapeño Mac is perfect, not too spicy but as a kick and the potato salad is mustardy, not vinegary. This is so worth the drive from Downtown Phoenix. :-)"}
{"text":"I was craving some good fish and chips last night so my husband suggested this place (his co worker goes to a different location and said this place was delicious). I am not one to give just 1 star normally but the food was horrible. The fried pickles were a joke. They are super thin slices covered in globs of oil soaked batter. The fries were soggy and the fish was bland and soggy. The sauces they gave tasted weird and they forgot to give us the mac and cheese we ordered. I think that was a good thing though. We threw everything away after a couple of bites. Such a waste of money since it was so pricey. Never again."}
{"text":"Lots of BBQ places offer sides with their meals.  At Tom's, you get great ones, with an extra one thrown in for free--a side of service.  I've had Texas BBQ and New Orleans BBQ before--some places are good and others are eh.  This is the first time I have ever had Chicago BBQ, and this is definitely one of those rare spots to compare all others to.  Every bite was tender and tasty, and their sauce had the perfect balance of flavors.  Billie, the lady behind the counter, was really friendly.  When there were no orders to be taken, she was out on the floor shootin' the bull with us and it made for a really pleasant evening of food and conversation for both my wife and I.  Recommended?  Oh hell yeah.  Eventually, my wife and I are going to have to get back to vegetarianism after our long absence, but  places like this make what we have to do a bit harder.  When we finally do decide get back to the realm of bunny food, I have a good mind to come back here one more time and go out with a bang."}
{"text":"I ordered a couple of items from this place and nothing was really that good.  The speed of the order and customer service was excellent, but the food was average at best."}
{"text":"Wow! Damn good BBQ! So far the best I've eaten, but I honestly don't have much experience here. The prices are fair for the amount of meat and the gastronomical  experience you'll get after eating their pulled pork sandwich.   We visited ths spot after reading all the positive reviews on Yelp, so it's a definite must eat in Phoenix and Tempe! Thanks for the great response from this place from other Yelpers because it's well worth it.   The service was friendly and perfectly suited for this place. I don't remember the gals name but she had a great southern style charm that made you feel like family and made you laugh.   The side sauces were amazing with your choice of regular and spicy. Both were flavorful and delicious so I recommend getting both and alternating.   The brisket looked delicious too, so my next visit will be to try that.  Definitely a must eat in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Just found it and tried the fish fry tonight.  You can order white fish or catfish, all you can eat.  It's the best fish yet! We'll definitely be back for fish as well as try other menu items.   The staff is very friendly as well.   I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"The BBQ is decent, depending on what you get (the brisket is meh, the chicken is pretty good, the ribs are decent).  The Saturday college football viewing is nice.  The service is friendly, even when your kids are making a huge mess.  It's definitely going in the Saturday afternoon rotation."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Tom's one time and one time only.  We tried their hot link and rib tip platter.  The first thing we were both horrified over was the thickness of the rib tip.  Credit card thin was the best descriptor.  Rib tips from the places I remembered back in Chicago were much thicker than this and had waaaaaaaaaaaay more meat.    The hot links really looked and tasted more like spicy hot dogs instead of italian sausage.  The sauce definitely left a LOT to be desired.  The aftertaste had me grabbing my drink faster than a Porsche 911 Turbo on nitrous gets from 0-60.    After the first bite, my wife and I tossed the stuff in the garbage and vowed NEVER to come back to this place because they have absolutely no idea how to do Chicago style BBQ properly."}
{"text":"I always go to toms in mesa cause i work out there and I love it!! Try this location cause i live on the west side and omfg!! They are out of tips,no potatoes, and out of fried pickles?!?!?!?!?  The bathroom stinks and it looks run down in here..also there is a sewage smell.. Never again very disappointed in this location. Never again!! I will continue to go to the mesa location. The lady at the desk didn't even give me my points for 5star!! Wtf!!!"}
{"text":"Super good food, great sauces! I've eaten here once and I will definitely be back. Sand which was really good. The jalapeño macaroni was just ok. The fried zucchini made up for it though!"}
{"text":"It just wasn't very good.... I got cornbread and pulled pork, and didn't even finish my meal. Didn't taste like home cooked southern food to me (if you've had the real thing then it's hard to like anything less.)"}
{"text":"This was my first time here. The food was awesome. We got a family pack and had 6 of us. We got ribs, beef tips and chicken. It was awesome. We got Mac n cheese and potato salad as sides. They were great! The service was awesome, the food got to us pretty fast too! The price was super reasonable as well. It's a cute charming place with good food and kind service!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give it ten stars! Finally a place that makes kick-ass brisket! I've been looking for years now and I am happy to know where I can get great BBQ. Famous Dave's is pretty good and Rudy's bbq just plain sucks. Thanks Toms BBQ for doing it right!!"}
{"text":"Basically the best food,atmosphere,and Billie (the cashier) is the best! She is full of personality just like the food is; just amazing! Come here for a good price and EVERYDAY has some type of special to help you save money on their ALREADY low prices! Plus they play all the oldie songs that you just can't help but sing along to!"}
{"text":"Tried the pulled pork.  Not good couldn't finish my sandwich and I am a fan of pulled pork!  It tasted like it was boiled meat, not BBQ.  The BBQ sauce was the best part and the waitress was friendly and helpful.  Won't be coming back here.  Sorry I tried it.  Nothing wrong with corn on the cob but how can you make that bad?"}
{"text":"Had amazing BBQ on a Friday night celebrating my hubby. Thank you Billie aka Mama Tom for the good eats in all you can eat fish night. ;-) YUMMY!"}
{"text":"Very good beef tips and brisket disappointed in the pulled pork. Liked the onion straws and jalapeno mac and cheese. Little pricey but would go back for the rib tips."}
{"text":"Great food. Fast service what more could you want?! Awesome BBQ for the area. I just wish the restaurant was a little bit bigger. And they don't have sweet tea for a BBQ joint which is very odd in my eyes."}
{"text":"Took the family to BBQ and they all loved the food.  We bought a family combo dinner that included three choices of meat (we chose pulled pork, smoked chicken with bone -in, and for 3$ extra we had brisket),  6 dinner rolls, and 2 large sides (we chose the mashed potatoes and gravy for both sides).  We also ordered a 1/2 slab of ribs.  We all agreed that the pulled pork was are favorite.  However, the other meats were also good.  Our only complaint was based on our experience we had taking the order \"to go.\"  The gravy was placed directly on the mashed potatoes, which was okay, but some people in our party did not like gravy.  Also, the BBQ sauces were hot and the containers were placed on top of the plastic lids for our sides and melted through into our mashed potatoes.  The mashed potatoes, when eaten without gravy, were dry.  Otherwise, we had a great visit and do plan to be back."}
{"text":"You have meat, and its drenched in sauce. How could you go wrong? Ask Tom's BBQ, they'll tell you! So I had the beef tips and chicken. Both heavily smoked and drowned in the same sauce. Beef and chicken...two completely different animals, but both tasted identical. The spicy sauce was bland and didn't have the slightest kick to it. The beef tips were overcooked, tough and chewy. The bone in the chicken was broken in two places and grossed me out. The fries were really good tho. Everything else ended up in the trash."}
{"text":"They have a pretty wide open menu for a BBQ joint, including home town staples like Italian beef and other chi-town styled sandwiches.  I suggest the pulled pork and the fried zucchini."}
{"text":"My family and I had the burgers and chicken tenders kids meal. The Western Burger is awesome! They use soft potato buns, BBQ sauce is good, and real thick bacon pieces. Natural cut, salty fries and you get plenty of them. None of us finished our meals. One of my kids got the chicken tender meal and it was enough for an adult. The ranch is good, they add garlic to it. The best part: the customer service!!! The lady who took are order was very helpful and went above & beyond, bringing out our order, even making my husband a chicken tender as she must of heard him when he said he wanted to try them too!! A+!! We will be back and I definitely want to try the BBQ & sausage or fish fry."}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago and I'm very leery when places advertise \"Chicago Style.\" This placed has good bbq sauce and rib tips. My wife had catfish and ribs and loved it. We sampled the rice beans and it was excellent. The service provided was also fantastic. We will back to try the Italian Beef and Maxwell Street Polish."}
{"text":"Sides are weak. Very weak. Rib tips have no meat. Pulled pork can be good, but never great. Hot links, nasty. It seemed like they just do not even touch their links on the grill, it seemed just boiled. Nasty...."}
{"text":"The place was fairly full with a mixture of couples and families.  A popular place on a weekend.  Good BBQ had the pulled pork platter.  The pork was flavorful and tender.  The BBQ beans were somewhat generic but the coleslaw had a nice crunch and a creamy dressing.   This was my first experience where they portioned out the BBQ sauce a single tiny cup and you had to request more.  It was a pretty good BBQ sauce for the pork.  The servers were friendly and attentive given all the people there."}
{"text":"Went in planning on BBQ but when I saw they had Italian beef sandwiches, I had to get one. The meat itself was pretty decent, and the sandwich was wet, like it should be. Unfortunately the bread and cheese were both pretty meh. The bread seemed like something you'd get in the prepackaged section of any grocery store and was a bit stiff, which is impressive for a wet sandwich. The fries were pretty good and the young guy working the counter was very friendly and helpful. I'll probably go back at some point and actually try the BBQ."}
{"text":"this is a good please to eat for lunch and the cat fish is  great big pieces, all so i have some  ribs from my  coworker they are good too.  ihave to  stop by there for something else soon."}
{"text":"Yum! Another restaurant nearby was packed, so we came to toms. The buns were soft and the BBQ beef was delicious. The sauce was tangy. We also had a Chicago beef wet (that's dipped in as jus). Not bad. Potato salad and cole slaw were good. I can't believe they aren't busier. Maybe a little high priced for lunch. Around $11 each."}
{"text":"Had the beef brisket dinner and was amazed at how tender my cut of brisket was - a beautiful plate of BBQ!  And Billie was a sweetheart.  She treated me like an old friend, so genuine and warm.  GREAT experience!"}
{"text":"GREAT PLACE FOR PROTEIN...Great ribs excellent  bbq pork sandwhich im very happy too have  them close only bad thing is READ BELOW   The only tip i have is to check your order before leaving. Both times going caught somethin  missing before leaving out the door. Also biggest thing is there poor  customer service NOT FRIENDLY AND EMPLOYEES ARGUE WITH EACH OTHER guy with glasses at the register is kinda rude"}
{"text":"I will not be back. I am offended that I ordered Catfish and was sold Basa (Swai). Born and raised in Chicago and lived there 44 years until 2 months ago when I moved to AZ, and I feel cheated that I wanted catfish and ribs but was sold Basa, which costs less and doesn't taste the same, not even the same texture and quality of fish. Disappointed! I guess if you don't know better, you would know the difference. They offered me a different meat, to which we took ribs but I'm turned off at the fact that they advertise catfish but give you something else. Basa is not Catfish! When you buy it in the store, they are not the same and they don't cost the same! I find it tons issue of ethics and false advertising! Just stick with the whitefish! Corn meal breaking does not make it Catfish!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing !!!! Pulled pork is my favorite. Awesome service our server was so sweet! Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, very helpful. However, what really counts is the food; which was AWFUL.   I ordered the 2 meat combo with chicken and ribs. I can almost guarantee this meat has never seen the inside of a smoker. The taste is chemical, as if they were using liquid smoke rather than bothering with the real thing. The chicken has a texture that suggests it was boiled.   It bears mentioning that I also tasted the pulled pork. It was extremely salty, acidic, and tasted like it should have been thrown out yesterday.   Furthermore, the sauce tastes like they picked it up at Costco. It's so sweet it's cloying, and it's just dumped on top of the already cooked meat. True barbecue has the sauce cooked on. This place does barbecue a great disservice."}
{"text":"NFL Ticket, open early for Bears games, great staff, full bar, good food!  GREAT PLACE TO WATCH THE GAME!"}
{"text":"Anyone from Chicago has to go!  its just like one of the little hole in the wall type places in Chicago that has all the classic food with a new flavor and taste.  Their Beefs are AMAZING!!  The service was Amazing.  Billie was the nice lady working and she is a gem!  So nice and caring and very concerned about the appearance and performance of their restaurant.  I have been back 4 times since and the food seems to get better.  It is a little pricey, but worth it!! You are supporting a real small business that deserves your patronage!  You must try a Beef from there.  It is a different sandwich than Al's, so it is tough to compare, but if you love classic Chicago Beef this is the place for you!  if you have never been to Chicago this is a true taste of it!"}
{"text":"Toms seems to have been dropping in quality over the past few years.  I keep wanting to go back in the hope that it will be as good as it used to be but it just isn't.  This visit will probably be my last.  The bun on the pork sandwich was stale beyond belief.  I had a Maxwell Street Polish.  The grilled onions were still crunchy and the sausage was so dried out it almost had the texture of jerky.  The fried pickles were nothing to write home about.  The only decent thing we had were the curly fries.  Sorry Toms but you continue to disappoint."}
{"text":"The truth???  I've been here twice this week :)  Delicious! I'm in love with the pulled pork entree with their hot bbq sauce. It's just fantastic. A plus also is their coleslaw is made w/o mayo which made me very happy and is great with the pork. They have a huge menu with lots of options you are sure to find something you will like. The sides for me in general are just ok to be honest but when I come here I come for the meat anyway.  My boyfriend loves their ribs and also their fried zucchini are huge and cooked just right.    Im a regular now and plan on keeping it that way for my pulled pork munchies"}
{"text":"This is one of my go to BBQ joints in the valley. I'm finding there aren't very many alternatives to St.Louis style BBQ. The sweetness of St.Louis style is not my personal preference. This is more Chicago style, which is a bit spicier that tastes best for me. Being a fan of Texas Style BBQ, when ordering a two or three meats plate one always has to be beef brisket not chopped. The pulled pork is consistently delicious and the brisket has a touch of fat. The Mac'n Cheese is amazing and super cheesy. Now what's the problem with Kraft Mac'n Cheese is it's never cheesy enough, but not here certainly not here. Get eat it...order it."}
{"text":"I'm originally from an hour north of chicago, and have always been a fan of Italian beef sandwiches, a staple of the area.   When i first heard of tom's i was skeptical, but after a year i was really dying for a good Italian beef. As soon as i entered the door, i knew i was in for a treat. The place didn't feel gimmicky with a Chicago theme, it just felt like i stepped right into Chicago. I felt at home.  I order a sandwich and the girl behind the counters asks, do i want it wet or dry. Being a fan of juice, i said wet. Little did i know i was going to get a soaking wet sandwich, and it was DELICIOUS.  I have made it a habit to always bring a friend when i'm craving Tom's, just to spread the love around."}
{"text":"I know that I've had Tom's BBQ before. I've seen them at events, but this was the first time I went inside to eat. We walked right in at lunchtime, but it wasn't too overly busy. There were people there enjoying the BBQ, but it was calm, relaxed and the food didn't take long. Most places are much more hectic during lunch. Billy was so friendly! We loved the BBQ and Chicago feel in Arizona. She also let us try some fried mac n cheese. YUM! I loved it and would have probably not known to order it as a side on my own. Thanks so much!!"}
{"text":"Delicious pulled pork sandwich combo with jalapeños macaroni. Just one flaw. No soap in the bathroom."}
{"text":"Ordered the pulled pork, it was very fatty and the pork was overcooked to mush.  Mc & cheese was comparable to velvetta boxed stuff.  Coleslaw was ok, nothing to get excited about.  Unfortunately not worth the money in my opinion.  Joe's BBQ on Gilbert Rd is way better and everything is home made,"}
{"text":"I can't even begin to explain how horrible this place is... Customer service is just as bad as the food. Being born and raised in Alabama I have a pretty good idea about BBQ and this isn't even close!!! Theirs nothing on the menu I could recommend at all. The food is way over priced... I'm sure the doors will be closed by the end of the year."}
{"text":"It was yummy, fast and the lady behind the counter was friendly and treated us like fam. Beef ribs were very meaty. French fries are killer."}
{"text":"My wife and I just webt to this place today. We've eating at the one in Mesa many times because, we live in Mesa. But today we were in Tempe and were hungry so we said heck yes and came here. Never again!!  First of all the fries were dripping with oil (very soggy) and cold. The Burger had sauteed onions that were so cold and dripping with oil that they was unedible. There's absolutely no flavor but boy was it messy. Second my wife had a meal that was okay but the macaroni and cheese was so crappy she had to throw it away. The only thing that was any good was the soda and now I'm at home in the bathroom because I'm sick. A my wife is also not feeling well. Never again  I will never go back to this place ever ever again! So just some free advice beware!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and great meal for lunch.  We tried the pulled pork with mac and cheese and it was delicious."}
{"text":"Hands down best smoked BBQ in the area. Family came in from California and we ordered a little bit of everything.  It was all good. Will be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Brisket sandwich was iffy. Meat tasted like it was reheated and was sliced very irregularly with some very unappetising pieces. Bun was ok but was NOT toasted and tasted bready overwhelming the small portion of beef which is a big mistake in my opinion. Meat portion was small for the price of 11.99 and only one side. Bbq beans were all very small beans which were cook properly, but served in a lot of heavy syrup with no meat or onions or veggies of any kind. Service was gruff and coffeeshop-like with no warmth or feeling of customer appreciation. Many good BBQ places in metro Phoenix. Won't go back."}
{"text":"BBQ brisket lunch special was a minimal portion of meat covered in sauce; what if I don't like sauce, they almost completely ruined the lunch because of how much sauce was on it. I love pecan pie and opted to make my lunch better by getting some desert, wrong. By far the worst thing I have ever put into my mouth. I will never return. THE STAFF WAS VERY NICE, so I feel a little bad writing this."}
{"text":"Meh. Took my 10 year old son here and neither of us loved our food. We both got a grilled chicken sandwich - the chicken was so chewy and rubbery - not at all appealing. The BBQ sauce that we asked to substitute in instead of mayo, was good. Originally, I started to order for our family (to take home), and they were out smoked chicken breast. I'm wondering if they would have been more resembling of real meat vs the rubbery chicken-like sandwich we just consumed... blech.   The service was friendly.   Ambiance. Meh. Nothing spectacular, but it is clean.   Lots of easy parking."}
{"text":"I've only had the pulled pork sandwich with fries/ mashed potatoes. Not a fan of the potatoes but the fries seem to be a safe choice. It was tasty, but it's nothing spectacular. The brownie was also dry."}
{"text":"Fantastic BBQ. Local family owned business providing great service and food at very reasonable prices. Try the beef brisket, it's amazing."}
{"text":"Stopped in with my baseball team, and it was a great choice! Incredible bbq, fantastic service. Billie was so sweet and funny taking orders, and even came out to hang out with us after we ate. I had the brisket and ribs, and the hot bbq sauce was perfect. Definitely coming back as much as I can while I'm here, and I'm taking some of that sauce home!"}
{"text":"OMG  My first and last visit, EVER. I was craving pulled pork read the rave reviews pulled into this location got the pulled pork sandwich & Chicken/Rib dinner w/ fries & jaleono cornbread;paid a dollar extra for no issue there  and a mac and cheese as a side every bit of the $30 that I spent on this order had to be thrown away it was not edible. I wish I would have checked before I left. french fries were cooked beyond recognition if they were may be cooked 3 times the jalapeno cornbread one bite I couldn't swallow it it tasted like it had been cooked in or mixed in with oil that was used not only for fying fish along w/ the french fries forgot about that as badly as they were cooked they smelled of greasey fish oil the chicken was dry the ribs I don't even know if they were cooked but they were not edible or burnt on the outside and we're on the inside the suppose at home baked desserts or baked desserts there fresh must come out of a box and the pecan pie the brownies out of a box horrible and the pecan pie I don't know but somewhere cut up and put in a container to made look like it was made there was maybe the cons cons on top and then the rest of it was I don't know what... gross. Okay I take ownership for not checking that they had before even pulling out but I don't know that that would have helped so left $30 no dinner in the garbage where it is and fuming mad never will I go there again ever ever ever nor would I recommend this in any way shape or form , never,  I don't see a fix for this one"}
{"text":"Tom's is consistently mediocre.  To be fair, I typically hold BBQ to a very high standard.  While Tom's is quite close to where I live, I don't go there very often.  I don't get a lot of deep, complex smoky flavors that are present in the best BBQ places.  A lot of their meats taste basically steamed.  The sauce is decent.  Sides are very ok.  The lady owner who works at the counter sometimes is nice, but also weird. I have heard some really odd stories about the owners.  The prices are average.  I have not tried the Chicago style offerings, like Italian Beef.  I am sad that Tom's is as conveniently located as it is while remaining completely uninspiring."}
{"text":"Would give 0 stars if possible. DO NOT go to Tom's! The wait is unnecessarily too long. Carry out or eat in both have extremely long waits. Tom's needs more employees.   Basic, simple menu. The food is not good enough to wait for slow, undermanned staff.  Won't go back. Don't waste your time!"}
{"text":"Today was sad for me went into Toms BBQ to celebrate their birthday I got the pork Sandwhich 7.50 combo and a crispy chicken Sandwich. I came home and noticed a skimpy piece of chicken in my Sandwich  usually it is a nice piece of juicy chicken .This was sad maybe next time guys"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!  I don't consider myself a BBQ connoisseur, but I know what I like:  1. Heat 2. Little (not too much) sweet 3. Smoke  This place has a fantastic sauce that I think I would eat on everything from waffles to eggs! Ok, maybe I am stretching a little there, but not by much.  Now what to put under the sauce?  They have all the classics; pulled pork, brisket, chicken, chicken wings, etc. etc.  For me, it has been, since my first visit, all about the hot links.  My mouth is watering just thinking about them!  Great flavor, and that sauce doesn't cover it up, but really shows it off.  I am so blown away by these links that I will have to eat them a few more times before I can given anything resembling a useful review.  All of the sides are scratch-made, and the flavors show that off.  My favorites are the red beans and rice, and the potato salad.  Good prices, great portions, and wonderfully entertaining staff!"}
{"text":"Went out to this East Valley location since I got a great deal from Entertainment that offered free BBQ Sandwich with a purchase of sides and drink.  The place looked like a bar with country western feeling to it.  Menus are written on boards where it is clearly visible just like an 60's American diner.  Ordered the Sandwiches (brisket and beef) that comes in very small portions with extra spicy (not kidding here) and mild sauce.  Their baked beans is absolutely delicious and will remind everyone around me looking for cover with lots of flatulence hours later.  Fun place to be."}
{"text":"Great barbecue place one of the best in Tempe. The lady employee is the best makes you feel like you are a family friend. A little expensive but always makes you feel like you've ate good"}
{"text":"This was a great find. Billie (manager) is such a hoot and so sweet. The food is amazing and the service wonderful! If you get a chance, go go go."}
{"text":"Unfriendly service from the girl who takes the order at the cash  register, I ordered 1/2 rack of ribs  very dry meat and light warm not even hot out of the oven, their cut fries wasn't cooked you could crunch into the potato, and their green beans were the brightest green which means they were frozen cooked mixed with hard to chew bacon. Their cole slaw was very mayonnaisey and unflavorful. One good thing, they had bbq sauce you could use like ketchup to smother out the bad flavors."}
{"text":"All in all ok bbq they kinda skimp on the portion sizes. Young guy at the counter deserves  an award for putting up with so much crap. We tipped him a $20. Beware the argueing between the staff kind of a big turn off. Primaramy an older gal who i can only asume is the owner yelling at people that they arent doing things  her way."}
{"text":"I've had one thing on the menu, and while it was good that's not what makes me want to go back.  This place had some of the best, most helpful and friendly counter service I've seen in a long time.  She knew folks names.  She remembered things they'd eaten.  She offered recommendations for first time folks.  She had that way of making you feel like you were the smartest most special person she'd helped that day.  Miss your mom?  Come here for lunch.  Now the food was good to.  She said I'd made a great decision in picking their BBQ beans as my side and not until I tasted them did I think she was being more than polite.  These were awesome.  The beans still retained their good firmness, not all mushy and falling apart as some can be, and the sauce was really amazing.  I got the pulled pork sandwich which had been my plan, and she encouraged it as well as it's their most popular option.  The funky thing here is that they put a thin layer of cole slaw on the bottom bun, then add non-sauced meat on top, then pour sauce over the top and add the top of the bun.  VERY interesting.  I think next time I might try it without that - but it was certainly interesting.  Though they have a great selection, so I may just have to try one of their Chicago Hot dogs or Rome Rib Tips or Chicken.  SO many awesome looking options!    But really - you should go just for the sweet lady at the counter.  And all the figurines of pigs on the counter.  And Chicago memorabilia all over the walls.  It's just a nice place with good food.  Gotta love that."}
{"text":"The chopped  beef sandwich was only so-so, but the fries were out of this world -- I'd  go back just for them! Also, I usually ask for sauce on the side and I forgot this time so the sandwich was slathered over with BBQ sauce. Next time I'll try the pulled pork."}
{"text":"Obviously coming in on\" good Friday\" (at 7:48PM) was a terrible idea. It comes down to this, we waiting an entire hour for our food. 2 adult meals, and a kids meal. 50 dollars in food..  My husband went in and asked what's up, our food wasn't even being made yet! We got a refund, & myself, husband & 2 kids left hungry."}
{"text":"best. bbq. pork. sandwiches. in. phoenix. period"}
{"text":"Food was amazing and service was awesome. The cook himself even brought out our food. I had the brisket with mustard potato salad and BBQ beans. The beans were a rich smokey flavor and the potato salad had great seasonings. The brisket was smoky, sweet and hot. I will definitely be coming back as this place has a ton of different items on the menu."}
{"text":"If you come here for lunch, it is a great deal.  You get to put your favorites onto a sandwich for a great deal.  If you happen to order fries, they give you enough to feed an army.  The flavors are great and you can add hot peppers and BBQ sauce to enhance the entire experience."}
{"text":"The All-You-Can-Eat Fish Fry keeps us coming back on Fridays. The fish is great and the homemade tartar sauce is the perfect complement. Even our kids can't get enough!   The service is good, the staff is friendly, the establishment is clean, and there's a \"Cornhole Corner\" outside where kids can burn off some energy. The patio also has long picnic tables, making this a great place for families with lots of kids.   I'm so glad our neighbors (they are obsessed!) introduced us to this restaurant. I love the pulled pork sandwich, the coleslaw, and the hush puppies."}
{"text":"Quality quick food. The sandwiches were delectable. I thoroughly enjoyed the pulled pork sandwich and the house sandwich. They were both really good. The only reason this is 3 stars and not 4, is because they did not use real plates and utensils as well as cups. Other than that, all was well. The food was tasty, the service was solid, and the atmosphere was definitely unique. It felt like an authentic barbecue place for sure. I would recommend this to anyone with a short amount of time in search of some good bbq. Definitely a good choice to go here. Quality experience."}
{"text":"If you don't arrive at least 1 hour before they close or you will be hurry out the door"}
{"text":"Had a burger with chewy bacon, greasy fresh cut not fully cooked curly fries, flavorless meat. Sauce was good a little on the sweet side, fried pickles were good. Won't go back."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Great attitude from the staff. Fast fast service. What more could you want?"}
{"text":"I had Tom's BBQ cater a small company employee appreciate lunch. Food was great (I got a compliment from every employee how much they LOVED the food), service was awesome!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the rib tips! It was so delicious the cashier was so friendly and personable. I would definitely be back soon!!   Sorry I forgot to take a picture of the food."}
{"text":"Cashier was annoyed when I asked if they had gluten free options. He told me they don't so we left."}
{"text":"Probably closer to 2.5.  Last time we went we walked out because the server couldn't get to our table in under 10 minutes.  Why, because as I've noticed before, they were talking to other customers.  Not taking orders or something else...they were flapping their jibs.  When your food is adequate at best, and the Red, White and Brew in your same parking lot has already gone out of business...now would be a good time to step up your game."}
{"text":"The owners are real Chicagoans. Love their attitude and service (way better than Hertz). However, the food is a bit lacking. Maybe that's why the place was empty at lunchtime?   I had a jumbo bbq sandwich with fries. The sandwich was huge - puts Joe's to shame. However, the bbq was rather bland. The meat was not smokey and the sauce was meh. The bun was cold and broke apart, which was too bad because it looked so good. The fries were okay, just not my favorite style - more like boardwalk fries.   I'm going to go back because there's a chance that the Italian beef will be good."}
{"text":"Location: plenty of parking and the restaurant is super open, clean and spacious. They even have few TVs on the wall.   Food: I came here to try the beef brisket last night. I agree with other yelpers, it is just average and a bit dry. Their corn bread is too sweet and wasn't the type that I am used to. Service is excellent. I believe the owner/manager was a lady and she was super friendly to check on everyone.   I might come back here again to try something else."}
{"text":"Tom's bbq is best food I have had in a long time being from Wisconsin I miss home and Tom's bbq takes me back home and  they have the best cashier/ waitress her name is Bobbie and she makes u feel at home  tom's in tempe is worth your drive so go get the good food and meet the great people they have working there"}
