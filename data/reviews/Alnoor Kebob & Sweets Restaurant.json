{"text":"In my recent checkered past, I stumbled into this place @ 3am in the morning, in a God know's why scenario :-)  The approach was half the story.  I am there looking for food on Harwood, again 3 am, new to the area, and I see an open sign.  It was Alnoor Kebab or 7-11 at this point at night, so I thought hey, lets give it a shot :)  Ready for my welcome?  Owner sees me pull in my car, and turns off the Open sign.  I start walking towards the door, because what do I have to lose?  I ask him if he would serve me.  He says what?  Beer.  No man FOOD.  Hmmmmmmmm.....lets me in.  He is randomly having a private function, and an African Indian group (his background) is wrapping up what looks like a one off late night private function.  I listen to some music, watch a couple people dance, engage with a couple people, and get to ordering some Baryani.  Yes I returned a couple times.  I would rate him #2 (so far) in my quest for Indian food in Ajax.  But there are far better in Scarborough lets say.  But it does the trick.  The owner Alnoor has actually very good customer service.  Remember he is the only guy that works there, literally.  You ring the bell, he says 1 minute.  He emerges from some curtains in about 4 mins.  Takes your order, goes behind the curtain, makes the food, and then brings it to you.    No, no, no, no, no.  It is not a bring your next date scenario.  You can eat there if you want.  But it is no frills.  Ring the bell, get your food, and usually get the f*ck out.  Enjoy :-)"}
{"text":"The Butter chicken is really good but overpriced.   The rice it came with was ROTTEN when I say rotten I mean smells like a faint nail polish remover and has a slight tint of purple to it.    I feel as if the owner knew the rice had gone bad because he kept urging me to get his rip off saffron rice instead. I should have gotten the god damn the saffron rice.    . . . Fuck al noor"}
