{"text":"Old school fish and chips joint.  Small but efficient set-up.  Most people tend to take out their orders.  I always have the halibut and chips.  Yes the fish tends to be slightly oily but very tasty none the less.  Fries always hot and fresh.  Try the home made coleslaw.   This place can be busy Friday and Saturday evening so get in there before the dinner rush.  Closed Sundays!!"}
{"text":"Very good food, quite decent customer service, and decent prices.

M'lady and I were looking for some decent food on our way to Square One, and we happened upon this place. We were hungry and liked the prices of the \"specials\" on the front window, so we walked in.

The place wasn't very large with 3 tables for the customers' usage and 2 chairs on each side of each table. It seemed all-in-all more like a take-out place.

The prices were pretty decent considering the food. The only negatives were that they generally charge 10 cents for tartar sauce which is just one of those \"to go\" packets of it, and also no itemized bill provided at the end of your transaction so you could check if they actually charged you for the little packets or not (it didn't seem like they were going to charge me for them based on the fact that when they said my order back to me, they didn't mention it, but they did provide me with it) :-)

Either way, customer service was friendly all-in-all with the staff eager to help: when one of the staff was busy with the previous customer, another one came up to start taking our order, which I found to be quite nice.

So all-in-all, my complaints on the place are so minor that they're practically non-existent, hence the lack of stars subtracted from my review.

I'd definitely go back to this venue again to enjoy some fish & chips :-D"}
{"text":"We were taken there by a co-worker who is a regular and spoke very highly of them. The store/ restaurant is really small, only a few tables and chairs, but for lunch hour on a Friday there was plenty of room for us to wait. 
And we didn't have to wait very long at all, the four of us took our five meals and left in about 10 minutes! It could have been longer than that, we were busy reading all the jokes and cartoons on the wall, free entertainment while you wait.

The fish (halibut) was crispy and tasty and the fries were good, but I have received bigger portions of fries for the same price in other locations. I tried a friends gravy since I didn't buy my own and I liked it. I will buy a gravy for my fries on my next visit. I am sure I wasn't charged for my tartar sauce, I think you only get charged if you ask for more than two.

There will be a next visit, the owners were friendly and very efficient. Thanks Paul!"}
{"text":"Well what can I say? It is within walking distance and the wall has some funny jokes posted. Those are about the only positives I can give.

We went there last week. The fish were very oily. My wife sked for Tilapia and got Halibut. It was during the evening, so they had run out of Tilapia and therefore could not change it either. The two staff inside were constantly arguing.

Yep, never going there again."}
{"text":"Luv it  .....  checked it out once out of curiosity because it has been around older than I am.

No regrets  ,  great  fish , great  prices...... now I'm a regular , at least once a week. 

My favourites... Basa fish &  Coleslaw  along with the Tartar sauce  is  so good. 

Wish I had checked it out  EARLIER  !"}
{"text":"My fiance and I really wanted to check this place out for quite some time. When we did, we ordered the halibut with fries. The owners were friendly and accommodating. However when we brought it home the portions were very sad. The two pieces of fish were mostly batter and a thin layer of dry fish, to be honest it didn't even resemble halibut at all. The fries were just alright at it's best. We were still very hungry afterwards. We'll try another fish and chip joint in the future."}
{"text":"After seeing this Fish & Chips joint pop up in my \"insauga\" newsfeed a lot I thought I'd bookmark it and give it a try. I was finally able to grab lunch here today. It was a teeny bit hard to find coming from hurontario, but after passing the dollarama twice ... alas, I found it! 

The inside was small, dark and dirty. Seriously, no lights?? There were unclean tables & the floors needed a good mop job. The owners, who I assume to be husband and wife, were very sweet. I was looking for a lunch special but sadly there wasn't one. The prices were much higher than I anticipated. I decided to go with the halibut and chips. 

I Arrived home, opened up my teeny box and saw a small, thin, dry piece of halibut and a laughable amount of chip. The fish was not fresh, and the chips were not the best. Definitely sticking to my usual fish and chips spot \"Mississauga Marketplace\" at hurontario/eglinton. What a disappointment. How on earth has this place been open for so long?"}
{"text":"I had an appointment with my nail lady next door and had a long evening ahead. I decided \"why not, I'm hungry\" and decided to try a new place. Usually not a fish and chips eater, this was new for me.

The place is small, nothing great but decent. The lady and gentleman were friendly, offered suggestions and were kind. I went with the halibut and chips with a small coleslaw and drink. I paid $13 and change which is fair price. 

Let me just say this. AMAZING. I didn't even need tartar sauce that is how flavourful the fish was. It wasn't greasy and it was light- I liked the batter a lot. Great portion too. It was fried in front of me so I knew it was fresh. It was extremely filling and again...a great piece of fish.

I will 100% return. I'm glad they are close to home."}
