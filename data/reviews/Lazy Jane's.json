{"text":"This place rocks. Would come here very often if I still lived in Madison. Everything from the food, to the setup, to the décor is awesome. Not been to many places where you go to find more seating upstairs and it basically feels like you just got home. There are tables and then a whole loft-style area with couches and comfy chairs where people can hang out. But in an authentic way, not the forced Starbucks kind of way.

The food is stellar. Got the chorizo skillet which was amazing. My part also indulged in blueberry and raspberry scones which were awesome (taking cues from the other recommendations). I enjoyed a nice hazelnut coffee and then got the free refill! Also loved how you can take jars of preservatives/jam to your table to which were also delicious."}
{"text":"I really love Lazy Jane's because it is consistently great. Whether I am having brunch with friends on a Saturday morning or stopping in to grab a scone on my way to work I have never not been satisfied. 
Beyond the food, it is such a sweet spot that feels like you're in someone's home. You can't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"They keep it simple but they get the basics right. Good service, excellent food and great value. Breakfast burrito is delicious.  There is a wide selection in the bakery. The interior and furnishings are simple at best but I cannot fault this place!"}
{"text":"Eclectic, fun, different. Unfortunately I can't eat gluten - so those fantastic scones and muffins tease the crap out of me when I'm waiting in line. If you can eat that stuff, you'll LOVE Lazy Jane's! 
The breakfast creations available here are so yummy: funky cheeses, avocados, turkey bacon, etc. 
Oh yeah, awesome tea!
One minus, they could add another egg or so. I usually leave a bit hungry :). Maybe that's because I hold the potato too."}
{"text":"Scones are outrageously good. So is the SCC. They have recently been experimenting with not calling your name
out, which is a nice change, makes it quieter."}
{"text":"Warning: cash only.

I love brunch. The venue is a little cramped, but I love it. The great thing about Willy Street are the house-turned restaurants. Laz Jane's gives off that hipster/intimate feel in a way that I haven't found replicated by other places. Mickey's Tavern comes close with its upstairs antique shop, but I love the upstairs part of Laz Jane's. 

Their scrambles are delicious. If you are looking for an intimate brunch place, I would recommend this place, but you need to come early unless you're willing to wait. 

It's a great place to catch up with a few (up to a group of 5 would be my suggestion) friends on a weekend morning. You order at the counter and seat yourself. With a few couch seats (my favorite) and a bunch of small tables, you can have your own intimate gathering. 

There are many great brunch places in Madison, so if you're looking for what stands out, here's my opinion: come here if you want a hipster coffeeshop feel with good breakfast food"}
{"text":"Good deal of vegetarian choices, but quality of products questionable.  Frozen fruit on their waffles leaves something to be desired.  Baked goods are fab, but the seat-yourself packed-house atmosphere may cause anxiety in the most grounded of people.  I like the play area upstairs for keeping restless kids entertained.  Overall, it's a cute place to go on off hours."}
{"text":"Huge scones at very reasonable prices! I feel guilty having a large scone for breakfast but it's so good that whenever I go I have to get more than one to keep for subsequent days' breakfast as well. Lemon cream scones are by far my favorite. I have something for anything lemon. This review is for the café but if you are just looking to get scones, there's a bakery just a few stores down where they have scones and a couple other pastries for take-out. And you get to skip the line as well.

In all the times I'd been there I have always experienced a wait. The wait times depend on how early you get there and whether it's a holiday weekend etc. Just order at the counter, pay for your order, get your coffee/pastries and grab a seat to wait for your food. Love their breakfast/brunch items especially the eggs. I have a soft spot for eggs as well. Yes yes, they are supposed to be easy to make at home but having it at Lazy Janes on a nice weekend morning with their interior decos really give me a cozy feeling and also warms up my day during the winter months."}
{"text":"All I've had from here is the iced lemon scone, but it changed my life. I thought I knew scones, until I met this game changer. It haunts my dreams."}
{"text":"General Suggestions:  Don't go during the weekend!  Have at least $10 cash per person.

I've been going to Lazy Jane's for years and have always had amazing food up until  the last two times.  I am not sure if I was simply unlucky, but I felt the consistency problems should be reported.  On the last visit, I went with some friends from out of town and all four breakfast items were cold and tasteless.  I had never had such bland tasting food at Lazy Janes, even their potatoes were not the same.  

On the last two visits I ordered my usual morning bun as well and both times it was extremely dry and not the same as I had been getting for the past five years.

If you go there during lunch hours, I would recommend the artichoke heart sandwich, always a good choice.  Though I do not like potato chips in general and their homemade ones are no exception, I would reccommend substituted for the greens, as they have a very peculiar, strong dressing they top them with that does not agree with my tongue.

The staff is always very warm and welcoming.  The seating situation is laid-back which is nice, but also annoying if you have a large group.  What I would like to see is an additional location opened.



I hope my next visit is the Lazy Jane's I used to love..."}
{"text":"OK - how fair is a 3 star review? Well, Yelp tells me that it means A-OK. So I think it's legit. Let me preface though by saying that I didn't eat any of the pastries - I hear good things, so maybe I'll revise this up after I have.

So why?
1. The food was fine. I didn't have any complaints, but I wasn't overwhelmed either.

2. Tables - Rob P's assessment is pretty much dead-on I'd say. I felt like I was competing at musical chairs. That can be fun, but sometimes you just want a little more organization to the process (ala Marigold). Must have been one of those days for me...

3. The convenience factor is kind of meh. Small parking lot and I don't live over there. Again, it can contribute to the overall atmosphere (I love Brasserie V and no one ever accused them of even having a parking lot...), but I guess I'm not in love with the kitsch scene.

I'll probably go back and I wouldn't anyone to NOT go there, but if I was making breakfast/brunch recommendations - I would probably suggest a double handful of places in Madison before Lazy Jane's."}
{"text":"I have just found my new favorite breakfast spot in Madison. Wow. The reviews are right, the scones here are the best I've ever had. But if you prefer more savory breakfast items, the scrambles are incredible too. I had the salmon scramble, which tasted light and fresh - it was heavenly. The chorizo scramble has a hardier taste, but is equally delicious. The wheatberry toast and their jams are worth trying too!! 

Something also needs to be said about the homey environment here - it is so inviting, and despite serving such great food, it isn't at all pretentious. I came here with about 10 friends, and while I know this place can be a little crowded during normal brunch hours, we found seating right away. 

Nothing beats good breakfast in a friendly environment with people you love - I will most definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I was visting a friend in Madison from Boston and she took me to Lazy Jane's on a  Sunday and I loved it! I am gluten free and found that everything tasted delicious-- right down to their gluten free scones YUM! Free coffee refills, friendly and creative vibe, perfect brunch place. Hope to go back soon!"}
{"text":"Best scones I've every had, especially the cherry ones. This is a very charming family-friendly place for breakfast so bring the kiddos. It's like eating at grandma's house, it's that cozy and sweet, with some retro touches and you can eat in the attic too. The food was delish--pumpkin pancakes and an artichoke scramble. Did I mention the scones? I would give it 5 stars, but the limit on coffee refills is a problem and a downer--just have free coffee refills available upstairs please!"}
{"text":"Be prepared to wait awhile, because there will be a line..but worth the wait! Breakfast was delish! Scrambled eggs w/ cream cheese & green onion is a must have!! They also have a great bakery with some of the best scones I've ever had..we tried the lemon, maple nut and almond joy scones...all of them were yummy!

*cash only
*parking is not easy"}
{"text":"I have tried several of their scones and breakfast meals.  I have been impressed every time.  I love the cheesy grits, the lemon scone (omg, seriously, the lemon scone), lemon ginger tea.  

BUT if you have not been before, weekends are crowded.  I haven't been earlier than 10am, but it is packed with a line out the door every saturday or sunday I've gone from 10-12.  Also, only open till 2, cause it's more a breakfast place.  But go chill out upstairs when they are super packed."}
{"text":"Lazy Jane is my favorite cafe in Madison along with Sophia's. I love how they call my name when my food is ready--it reminds me of having breakfast at my parents' on sunday morning! 
I like to munch on their muffin tops and/or scones while waiting for my fritata with sour cream--which has a huge portion.
My friends and I end up having wonderful time every time we visit and dine here. Oh and their freshly baked chocolate croissant is so perfectly crips and flaky and everything nice! I truly miss here!"}
{"text":"Have eaten here many many times over the past 6-7 years. Their scones are delish, for sure. 

But everything else is underwhelming including their coffee (and their cream pitchers are always lukewarm). I always like to try tofu scramble at breakfast places and Lazy Jane's version is just weird: it's cubed tofu with vegetables, like a stir-fry, NOT like tofu scramble. A good version is light and fluffy like scrambled eggs.

I go there when it's the only option."}
{"text":"Lazy janes has quality bakery, especially their scones, which are some of the best (start with a lemon or berry-flavored one). The interior is cozy and charming, a place that is enjoyable to spend time at. The food is decent - the tomato soup in particular is delicious, but really I come here more for the pastries and to hang out than for a meal."}
{"text":"Came up from Milwaukee looking for a cute place to get breakfast and this place was great! Super cozy. Perfect egg's and diced potatoes. Super friendly service and amazing scones!"}
{"text":"I was anti-scone until I came to Lazy Jane's.  That all changed after I took my first bite of a lemon creme scone.  It was life-changing.  5 star scone all the way.  And after the lemon creme, I tried every other variety, and was never disappointed.

I had breakfast here several times and it was always good, but really the scones are what kept me coming back.  Go here and please eat a scone for me.   

Notes:  You can skip ahead in the line if you are just getting scones.  So that's a definite plus.  But they don't take credit cards, so that's a minus for me.  They do have an ATM inside."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great food.  A friend and I came here on a Saturday around lunch time and the place was pretty busy, but we ordered and received food in less than 10 minutes (it may even have been closer to 5 minutes).  Everything was just as we had ordered it, and delicious.  Loved this place and would highly recommend it to all!"}
{"text":"just got back from having a delish breakfast. my artichoke heart, whole garlic, spinach, sun-dried tomato pesto, asiago cheese scramble was marvelous. they have a number of fair trade coffee flavors, baked-daily scones and buns, and all the charm you could ask for.

it's been a while since i've eaten lunch there, but the open-faced melts are excellent, as well is the grilled cheese with avocado.

you with the little ones, there are tons of toys and books upstairs near the couches; just be sure to pick up when you leave! it feels like your living room, but it belongs to everyone. also, it's a bus-your-own place, so when you're done eating, find the closest tub and help out the staff by putting your dishes in it.

be prepared to drop $20 for two with coffees and a tip. if you like cozy, livingroom-like dining experiences with a little kitsch, this place is for you."}
{"text":"i oedered the seitan hash because the previous reviews raved about it, but i have to admit i was disappointed. the scones were good, but i am used to them not being so sweet. oh well.

the staff is great, the ambience is perfect to wake up slowly and even though i did not like my food so much i can tell they care about the food they are making and that they do so with love. I would still recommend this place to anyone who wants something a little different.

i'm a fan!"}
{"text":"You just have to love this place!!  The decor is just so cute!! I love how they have couch seating upstairs that allow you to feel 'just like home'...  
Teresa, who took our order at the counter, was just an awesome sweet lady!!  She definitely made a visitor like me from California all warm and fuzzy inside with her kind hospitality.
My husband and I tried the daily special grilled chicken sandwich. This is probably the juiciest chicken sandwich I've ever had!!  I have never been a breast lover but they were able to make it so juicy that I had forgotten I was eating white meat!!  The sandwich had a layer of fromage fort (which is Wisconsin cheese blended with various herbs) which was a killer for me since I love soft cheese and herbs.
Thank you for making our first lunch meal on our Wisconsin so memorable!!"}
{"text":"I go here at least once a week, sometimes more. The food tastes like it is made with love! The staff are seriously the best ever. They feel like family! Every so often a dish will disappoint me but when you eat as much as I do, it's bound to happen."}
{"text":"The scones are unbelievably good. I wish I could have them shipped to LA to arrive at my door fresh every morning. Lemon, mocha chocolate chip, regular chocolate chip...so sad that I haven't had one of these in years!

They gets four stars, though, cuz they need a separate gimme-all-your-scones counter."}
{"text":"This place is gloriousness on a plate, and a coffee cup.  I stumbled on Lazy Jane's one summer biking around the lake and now come back everytime I am in town. Everyone here is amazingly friendly, always offering free food to first time customers.  I havent ever had anything besides the egg and vegetable omelette because I dont want to mess with a good thing, but friends have raved about the homemade granola and other bakery items.  This place is always really busy and there isnt a lot of seating, so you will need to wait on the weekend, but while you are, you can look at the art from local artists that is displayed and for sale and wait for your name to be screamed in a welcoming way by the cook knowing that your food is ready. This place is good stuff!"}
{"text":"Go there.  Be patient while you wait in the line.  Eat a frittata and a scone.  If you haven't done this already, you're missing out in a big way."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast place in Madison.

Insanely good bakery. Fantastic coffee. Friendly service.  Hearty food.

Everything I've ever had here has been filling and fresh.
And no matter the time of day or how busy they are, the service has always been with a smile.

Bummer they only accept cash, but the ATM is right but he register.  No matter how crowded, there's always a place to sit.  

Protip: While standing in line, think of a clever name for your order!"}
{"text":"Oh yeah, had the pancakes here the other day along with 2 egg and a side of bacon and it was smashing.  Don't let the line scare you, there is a lot of seating inside and the food comes out pretty darn quick after you order.  

An excellent spot for brunch or breakfast on Saturday or Sunday (I'm sure all other days too).  Looking forward to coming back and trying something else as long as the blueberry pancakes don't call me in...."}
{"text":"Great food and service in a cool part of Madison. Willy St is historically the hippie/artsy fartsy area of downtown Madison, so be prepared for this kind of culture in Lazy Jane's. The women who work behind the ordering counter are always fun and helpful, not to mention polite, even when they're swamped. The stuff is all made from scratch and the combination of the food and environment lends the feeling that you're a kid again eating at your weird aunt cathy's, but its awesome. I recommend the tuna melt or Rueben sandwich for lunch and a frittata for breakfast. Oh, and don't forget a scone! They're known for them."}
{"text":"There's a reason Yelp's overall rating is an average.  Restaurants can vary based on day of the week or time of the day.  I know this place has potential, but I was underwhelmed.  

Imagine a breakfast place where you stand in line to place your order, you then proceed to stand around like a vulture trying to find a table to open up (It's can be competitive).  You then sit down to babies crying, people STOMPing up and down the stairs, people squeezing past your table to claim their table,  people re-squeezing past your table to retrieve their food downstairs (more STOMPing), people re-squeezing past your table to bring their food back, then again to get the condiments they forgot. You get the point? This place is a commotion.  Kind reminds me of Ian's Pizza at bar time...except it's Sunday morning and you're trying to enjoy breakfast.  Occasionally they have to holler out people's names that didn't come to claim their food.  It's loud.

The above may be a bit harsh, but it's the truth, and not an extreme example. That said, LJ's could have a nice appeal to it when it's not the weekend.  I imagine they could have a nice relaxing place when there aren't 100 people in there. 

My food was nothing special.  Biscuits and gravy.  The biscuits were a bit dry.  I'd give them a 3 star. My girlfriend had the Chorizo scrambler. Picture attached. Pretty decent.

On a positive note:  The orange coconut white chocolate scone was awesome.  As Corey D says, \"It's bananas!\""}
{"text":"The food was pretty good, but not good enough to make up for the complete lack in all other areas.  I couldn't even order my food without the pretentious clerk behind the counter acting like i was an idiot for not knowing where the line started, even though there was only one person in line in front of us when we first walked in.   I get that the place is supposed to be laid back and a self serve type of thing but they need to have signs or a more helpful and friendly staff for first timers.  Then after we already felt a less than warm welcome we went to get our food from the counter, we heard our name screamed out,  and started walking away with the two plates they put out.  We quickly realized they weren't correct and turned back to see what happened when the lady cook told us in a rude tone that we should check with them before taking a plate.  Just so they know we are not their employees and they should probably put the right plates up before screaming out our names. long story short i have never written a review on yelp but left this place annoyed enough to do so."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now- both times for breakfast/brunch on the weekend and enjoyed both of my experiences. 
The first time I got the iced coffee (which you can get a free refill on!), blackberry scone, and the frittata and enjoyed everything. The person I was with got the butterscotch chip scone and the breakfast burger. Both of his looked and sounded amazing but were pretty disappointing- the butterscotch chip scone was too dry (the moisture from the berries in the blackberry one helped cut the dry-ness quite a bit) and I feel horrible saying this but the breakfast burger was just bad... the meat wasn't seasoned at all and it was overcooked- my friend ended up not eating any of it because it was so unappetizing. 
On the other hand, the second time I went I got the hot coffee (also comes with a free refill), morning bun, and the chorizo scramble while the person I was with got the turkey omelette (on the special board) and the blackberry scone. The chorizo scramble was delicious (especially with the green poblano Cholula hot sauce). My friend really enjoyed his omelette and the raisin toast he got with it. The morning bun was really good but it'd be pretty hard to mess up bread coated with cinnamon and sugar (the outer crust kind of reminded me of a palmier cookie). 

I love the upstairs dining areas because it feels very cozy and homey but it can get extremely loud depending on who is up there which can considerably distract from your dining experience so depending on the noise level, the downstairs area may be better. There are serving/condiment stations and bathrooms on both levels though which is super convenient.

I also really like how they have a wide variety of types of breads you can choose from for your toast and they also have delicious preserves on the side counter which I highly recommend trying. They have raspberry, strawberry?, and orange peel. At the downstairs condiment station they also have soy milk, 2%, cream, brown sugar, simple syrup, regular sugar, etc, etc so you really have access to everything you could want to add to your coffee which is really nice.

All in all the egg-based food and pastries I've had there are very solid and the staff there is friendly even though their constantly swamped."}
{"text":"Cozy, quirky and very Madison, Lazy Jane's is a Willy St. staple. If you weren't convinced by the thrifty, hodgepodge decor or the big Scrabble letters outside, try one of their ridiculously delicious scones. The gluten-free lemon cream scone is the only GF baked good I've ever had that doesn't taste like it."}
{"text":"Cute, homey, tasty food, toys for kids, gluten-free bread, home-brewed kombucha.  Managed to feed a collection of adults, including two gluten-free people and one lactose-intolerant and soy allergic person, plus entertain multiple young children.  Nice work!  Now just make some tasty gluten-free scones and I'll love you forever and give you all the stars I can."}
{"text":"Adorable, quaint coffee house with comfortable food. Peppermint mocha was so good! Blackberry scone was great. Lots of pastry options!"}
{"text":"It was a very interesting place to say the least.  I had a scrambled egg, toast, bacon and potatoes. Honestly, I liked the food.  The only quips I have about the place are that my toast was horribly over-toasted and it took forever to get the food.  Of course, the latter may have had to do with the fact that it was just after a rush and on Memorial Day.

I think I'll have to go back and see what the coffee and lunch type food is like!"}
{"text":"Sometimes the line gets long, especially in the later AM on Saturdays and Sundays for brunch but great food, and great atmosphere!
The speedy Eggwich is amazing!
Great scones too!"}
{"text":"As other reviewers have mentioned. come here for the scones! This place has, hands-down the best scones I've had in my life. I got the orange chocolate chip scone, just utter perfection. 

We also got brunch food -eggs (with cream cheese) and coffee. The eggs were okay, wasn't a big fan of the cream cheese combination. The potatoes though!! It's probably the best roasted potatoes I've ever had. Most places make it kinda dry, this one is soft and so greatly seasoned. Perfect texture and taste. Yummyyy!

All in all, I'm a fan of this place. It can get crowded so expect to wait for a seat, hover around and be aggressive or else you won't get a group table. Food takes forever too. If I'm in a rush I would go here just to grab the scones and leave. Too bad I don't live in the East side; otherwise I would come here probably at least once a week for a scone!"}
{"text":"Good food.  Really busy.  Its hard to negotiate between tables, chairs, screaming children, etc. with a full cup of coffee.  I got the granola with fruit/yogurt and my bf got the seitan hash.  both really delicious and my coffee was bottomless and we felt all in all very cozy, until we had to stand up that is :)  
Go early or go really late, maybe that is the secret?"}
{"text":"The restaurant itself it really cute and very \"Portland\" feeling - laid back and hippy.  The food i found was only so-so.  I had the chorizo & eggs plate - couldn't find any chorizo in it, assuming it's ground so tiny it's only adding a little bit of flavor.  I found it to be fairly pricey for what was received.  Cute place to sit around and drink coffee, but if you're looking for a good value breakfast, I would wait until you get to the Capitol square."}
{"text":"Wow. I really, really love Lazy Jane's. The scones really are THAT good and there is truly nothing better than waving that big Bakery Express Wand to get them. And coffee snobs may think it's trashy, but I am so glad they have hazelnut coffee.

The key to Lazy Jane's is to go very early on the weekend or really, any time during the week - it's small! Last week, I brought in Lazy Jane's scones for my office and I think I'm now everyone's favorite co-worker. I never noticed a bad attitude from the staff or fellow patrons. I wish I had kids so they could play in the adorable kid nook upstairs with toys, books and comfy couches! 

If you do insist on a late morning meal with a party larger than 2 on the weekend but can't handle the line, here are my tips to deal with it: check out the board, decide what you want, tell the designated \"order-er\" of your party, go grab a seat, and be happy."}
{"text":"I lived in Madison for a year and managed to not discover Lazy Jane's scones until the weekend before I moved. Phew. If I had known about the amazingly tart-but-still-sweet-enough raspberry scones with their excellent texture I would have had at least 2 a week and would have never fit in any of my clothes again. To repeat a common refrain - really, really good scones!"}
{"text":"Waited an hour in line. Fitata was ok, but nothing to brangs about. Hated the automatic tipping - which is ridiculous for complexly self-serve. Not worth the wait."}
{"text":"Do you guys put crack in your eggs?  Why are they so good?  For breakfast, I almost always get the works with turkey sausage and English muffin.  Yeah this place has long lines on the weekends.  That's because it's good ya fool."}
{"text":"The scones and baked goods are great. The breakfasts are very good. The staff is friendly.Be prepared for a wait. The restaurant is not as clean as I would like, and I have often found that the silverware needs an extra rinse."}
{"text":"This place is fabulous! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!! I moved here two years ago from Vermont (originally NH) And as soon as I walked in, it felt like I had been transported back to Burlington, Vermont.... which is a fabulous place by the way. There is adorable charm with wholesome food, great service, great prices, great portions and great vibes. I loved everything about it. That cafe feel meets diner food. Not only was I pleased with the food, i was pleased by their accommodations to Gluten free eaters like myself. Definitely come here! I even got just a regular cup of coffee... nothing fancy... but it was SOOOO GOOOOOOD. Love this place!"}
{"text":"amazeballs. seitan hashhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh nom nom nom nom nom nom good for me good for you good for baby drinking out of my boob"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Lazy Jane's!  The food is always delicious, the staff are warm and nurturing and the upstairs seating is awesome.  I have had many things both sweet and savory and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Best scone we've ever had, and the bfast tostada was also delicious. Friendly staff, good strong coffee too. Loved the unique colorful decor and furniture!"}
{"text":"Breakfast is my favorite meal, and Lazy Jane's is my favorite breakfast place. They have the standard eggs, pancakes, and baked goods, but they put a unique twist on each item. Occasionally, when new cooks are being broken in, the food might not be consistent, but they are usually on the ball and your meal might be ready before you sit down.

I love the converted house as restaurant, and hearing the orders called out is always amusing. If you've been there more than twice, Sadie will likely remember your name and standard order. Yes, the counter wait sucks during the rush hour, and finding seating the right size for your group can be tricky. But it's a small price to pay for good food at a great place. Just don't hold up the line. I might be behind you."}
{"text":"Amazing service, gluten free scones! I have severe allergies to some grains and they were so helpful - even escorting me to their bakery to look at the scone ingredients - which I was able to eat and were so dense yet moist. We are on the road and in a hurry. Food to go was fast and coffee was perfect! The next we pass through we will definitely be stopping by!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a great sit down breakfast spot to have a relaxing breakfast with little fuss, don't head to Lazy Jane's.  However, if you're looking for a friendly, eclectic, spot with good food and a chance to meet other patrons, Lazy Jane's is your place.

Order at the counter, and then wait till you can find a table.  You pick-up your own food, bus your own tables, and may need to share a table with others during the busy periods.  Vising in the winter gives it the feel of a ski-chalet camaraderie.

Their breakfast menu was hearty, though the hot apple and rhubarb compote was a bit to tart and the granola with fruit and yogurt had fruit that was still frozen.  

Lazy Jane's is definitely a place to check out at least once."}
{"text":"We just had our 2nd lunch here and, once again, Lazy Jane's delivered.  The tomato basil soup is enough by itself to get me in the door.  Husband and I each had soup and sandwich.  Mine was well balanced and tasty.  Same for the other sandwich as well.  Someone knows how to combine the flavors to compliment each other.  The breads are fresh and carry the load well.  The decor is eclectic and entertaining.  Love the numerous needle point pictures that adorned the eating area."}
{"text":"Lazy Jane's is a cute little breakfast/lunch spot that my friends and I love to go to! It is in a little house off of Willy street, and the atmosphere is warm and inviting. I really like their egg dishes- eggs with turkey sausage, frittatas, egg scramblers, etc. My boyfriend loves the BLT, and I really enjoy the turkey sandwich melt (a cold sandwich that I ask for warm). The service is sometimes a little slow, but the food makes up for it! CASH ONLY!"}
{"text":"The scones are AMAZING.

Some dishes can be a little on the salty side, but overall its tasty."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, the SCONES!
They are just perfectly crumbly and perfectly buttery.
When my friends say they don't like scones, I immediately take them here.

Because of the chaos on weekend mornings, I always make sure to go here for a weekday brunch.
The ingredients are fresh, and the staff are so friendly!

Just FYI, they don't accept debit or credit cards. ONLY CASH!"}
{"text":"I'd give this place 5 stars if I was voting on the scones alone.  But alas, they muck up the delicious scone menu with other breakfast items. I kid.  It's a fairly solid local breakfast joint that happens to serve out of this world scones.  

Go for the lemon cream scones! Now! They are heavenly.

The other food stuffs are really just OK.  There's almost always a long wait and their lattes are consistently horrible.  That said, the other items on the menu are fairly good, definitely not a destination restaurant but great if you're in that neighborhood. Remember to bring cash, CC are not accepted.

Go for: scones, SCC (scrambled eggs, cream cheese, chives) if you need a protein fix, or try one of their daily specials which are usually better than the regular menu items
the homey, eclectic east side feel

Skip: the lattes"}
{"text":"Kickin' cottage ambiance and a fun menu. I love this place and always go back for more sooner or later. Just be careful going during the rush (they get packed, but you can make it happen)."}
{"text":"Best scones in Madison -- no the Midwest! Homey, eclectic atmosphere. Always busy. Good location, minus the Willy St. construction (Summer 2011)... the only thing I find mildly 'disruptive' is the fact that they give an obnoxious shout of your name when your food is ready."}
{"text":"Awesome local place for breakfast!  Do yourself a favor, regardless of what you order, make sure to get a lemon scone."}
{"text":"I have been going here for years and thoroughly enjoy the  food, the coffee, and the overall atmosphere.  

The reason I gave it two stars is simply because my girlfriend nicely asked the cook in the window if her meal was ready.  The cook responded with a supremely snide remark in a very abrasive tone.   This was completely uncalled for and rude.  There was no reason for this cook to respond this way.

They have phenomenal food and coffee.  I am concerned that there customer service is going in the wrong direction."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast with the wife. Nice little spot with friendly staff just order at the counter , sit yourself and wait for your name to be called. Had the Chorizo scramble based on reviews and it was  very good. Not normally a scone fan but tried a raspberry one because of all the good reviews and that was very good as well. My wife liked her cinnamon french toast. Parking is pretty tight right in front of door."}
{"text":"Love this place!! 

Delicious, hearty, breakfasts, as well as awesome bakery items. 

Make sure you either get their really early (like before 9am) or late morning (around noon) because they get very busy during peak hours! 

Also:  Make sure you have cash, they don't accept credit cards!"}
{"text":"1. Scone amazing
2. Frittatta, jah?

This is the best place to be when it's raining midweek, or for a weekend brunch (it gets a little hectic). Great decor, great food, great setup.

There are costumes for the kids! I wish I could wear them.

Feels like home"}
{"text":"Yes, Lazy Jane's will redefine the word \"scone\" for you.  Scones aren't supposed to be the dry leaden vaguely sweet hockey pucks most coffee shops and restaurants serve. Nope- they are supposed to be light and flaky and buttery and flavor/fruit-filled. In other words, just as they are at Lazy Jane's.  I am a breakfast/brunch regular here because it's just so darn reliable. Sure, I could make myself a salami/provolone/mushroom scrambler with a side of turkey sausage at home... but for 8 bucks, why not cuddle up in a cozy corner at Lazy Jane's with some of their delicious coffee and- bonus- a scone too! The prices are beyond reasonable here and the only thing that's not absolutely delicious are their breakfast potatoes (just plain cubed potatoes- you could do worse). As someone who doesn't typically eat potatoes or toast anyway I really appreciate that at LJ's you can ask for no potatoes/no toast and not only do they smile and say \"Okay sure!\" they reduce the price as well.  Yup, it's just counter service but it is GREAT SERVICE HERE. 

I swear by their weekend specials and pretty much always order off that specials menu on the chalkboard- unique scramblers, omelets, French toast etc- but if they've run out for the day, I have the standby Chorizo Scrambler from their regular menu (secret: their fresh house made salsa served with that scrambler is totally on point!) Don't be scared off by the line. It's an efficient ordering system and it's all part of the charm."}
{"text":"Great little cozy, kitschy breakfast place. 

I love the setup of self - service... I  get to monopolize the jams and hot sauces without judgement. 

We ordered the cherry scone,  chocolate croissant,  raspberry scone,  the Works (toast, choice of meat - bacon, skillet potatoes, and two eggs), and chorizo scramble; comes with toast and potatoes. 

The scones are what they are famous for and they exceed my expectations. Crumbly yet rich, flavorful goodness. They had easily a handful or more choices today. The croissant had a crusty exterior with a soft doughy interior with generous amount of milk chocolate. 

The breakfast plates were also phenomenal. Crispy bacon and potatoes. Eggs cooked just how you like them and the salsa that came with the scramble was fresh,  almost straight from a garden fresh! 

All that for $25 before tip.  Beware, checks and cash only."}
{"text":"To be honest, I only got a Scone and Coffee here....However......

Really cool place I plan to visit again because....

1. I thought Scones we're just really old pastries until I came here. Damn good!
2. I want to hang-out next time, great place to do so.
3. Menu looks great and it's priced very reasonable.  (1 Egg, Potatoes and Toast is $4.00)  I think an extra dollar will get you two eggs.
4. The place is crowded, another great sign I need to explore the menu some more.

I am glad I came here and encourage others to check this place out.  Go it alone or with a friend, neat place to people watch too."}
{"text":"I had a really bad experience today (3/18/2017) at Lazy Jane's, the man with the yellow tinted glasses treated me very badly! The restaurant has refused to change the information on the drinks board from free refills to only ONE refill, this includes coffee as well. When I pointed it out the answer I got was so sarcastic, and simply very bad attitude that I will not go back. And I bet he expected a tip for such bad behavior! The restaurant has changed too many of their policies to be a place I would like to go back to. I would give them less than one star if I could."}
{"text":"Hands down one of my favorite brunch places anywhere. The food is delicious but the atmosphere, decor, and staff make it all worth it. There are such warm, inviting vibes and it is a great place to take a group of friends or a date. Also it is moderately priced so it won't break the bank!"}
{"text":"I frequent Lazy Jane's for 2 things:

1) The seitan hash (the only meat analog dish I'll touch)
2) To get sconed

This is one of my favorite breakfast spots in town.  I've run through a good chunk of the menu and it's all tasty.  I'm not usually a fan of the sweet stuff, but Lazy Jane's does it just right.  All the other reviews, are right: The scones are top-notch. 

I've gotta talk about that seitan hash.  This stuff is amazing.  It's meatier, more filling  and more savory than the non-veggie options.  I don't know what they do to make it so good, but keep it up!  If you need to have some meat, order it on the side.  

Prices are very reasonable, coffee is decent, portions are big and the staff is great.  Make sure to bring cash or hit up the ATM inside cuz you won't be using plastic here.  They've got a good mix of table sizes, so bring your SO, your friends or your entire extended family.  It gets busy on the weekends, so plan to wait a bit; it's worth it.

Sadly, they hand out buzzers on the weekends so no more [insert your NAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAME]."}
{"text":"fun vibe, and great food. I LOVED my chorizo scramble. Scones and morning buns are amazing. Good coffee. Only disadvantage is you have to go downstairs to get your drinks refilled."}
{"text":"Went out for thrifting at SVDP and pulled up this coffee shop in the area. It's literally across the street from St. Vinny's. Cute hippie looking decor on the outside. People from all walks were coming in for afternoon lunch. Moms with kids, business women and men, and friends out for a bite. Thought to myself this is probably a hot spot.

I walked in for coffee and pastries only so I'm not rating on behalf of the eating experience. The entrance was narrow. Wasn't greeted friendly by the cashier. I asked if they had different flavors of syrup for handcrafted lattes. Was told...\"they could make anything.\" Requested for a white mocha and was told they didn't have that syrup...LOL. Ordered a caramel latte and two fruit scones. The latte was mediocre - too much milk and the espresso was weak. Fruit scones were the bomb! The scones made up for my mediocre latte.

I went over to the coffee station to stir up my coffee and grab a lid. Saw the cooks putting up the food on the counter and it all looked delicious. I would definitely come back for a bite and update this review later."}
{"text":"The food is all made fresh and surprisingly fast. Better know what you want because you have to order and pay at the same time. There is usually a line, so if you don't like lines drive by first and take a look out front. The line usually goes by fast though. There seems to be a lot of locals from Willy Street who come here. Also a great place to grab a coffee and scone to go. The orange juice could have been better."}
{"text":"Great place! A must try in Madison. As everyone says, the scones are awesome!"}
{"text":"I might be getting old, but this place doesn't cut it for me anymore. I try not to eat animal products (read: vegan), but often end up making exceptions when eating out. I wish there was a vegan version of the SCC. I love that that they have waffles (Jane isn't that lazy if she has waffles), but I'm over standing in line just to have to get my own food.  It turns out they have vegan waffles, which aren't on the menu and are made from scratch, so be ready to wait a bit."}
{"text":"The food is not bad but reminds me of an under seasoned bad diner.  The eggs were noticeably greasy and the staff unfriendly.  My friend swears by this place and why it gets two stars rather than one."}
{"text":"I was in Madison for a conference and came by this place though my hotel was on the other side of town. The coffee was good and the pastries were delicious. Have a croissant (any croissant) and you will not be disappointed. My favorite is the almond croissant. 

The atmosphere is what kept me coming to this place. It attracts people of all ages and reminded me what it means to sit down and actually enjoy someone's company and conversation while eating. I liked it. Good vibes coming from this place."}
{"text":"As a brunch aficionado, I must say Lazy Jane's ranks up there on the Madison circuit.  Scone selection was amazing, and really, all the baked goods looked delicious.  I had the veggie frittata which was quite yummy and the Columbian Italian coffee was on point.  Slightly weird that they served it in a pint glass...for a minute I thought I was having Guinness for breakfast.  Fiance indulged in the chorizo scramble special, which was also pretty tastey.  No wait at about 10am on a Saturday, which was surprising, though parking was kind of a  b-.  And I kind of liked how they sang my name!  Overall, good eats - I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I loved the decor and cuteness of this cafe. I originally wanted to go to Lazy Jane's for breakfast but didnt make it in time but ended up getting lunch. I ordered the soup and sandwich combo of half a ruban and French onion soup.  The sandwich was good but had a bit too much sauerkraut, however the soup was flavorless and needed a bunch more seasonings.   I hope next time I go I can make it for breakfast or order something better."}
{"text":"Wow what a great find in Madison. Probably one of the best breakfast places I have ever been too. You MUST try the scones and enjoy a hearty cup of joe with 'em. The staff was extremely nice and I enjoyed every minute of my experience for Saturday brunch. Be prepared for a lot of food at a great price. I can't recommend this place enough and am so happy I found it. Get there early to avoid lines!"}
{"text":"This is really more like 3.5 stars but I rounded up because this place is just so gosh darn cute. My boyfriend and I came here on a Saturday morning and were expecting a longer wait but we only stood in line a few minutes before it was our turn to order. I ordered the veggie scramble and my boyfriend ordered the standard breakfast with eggs, toast, and bacon. 

I think we may have gotten the wrong items because I honestly was just not that impressed by my scramble. It had a lot of veggies in it which was nice but was lacking in flavor and seemed like the sort of scramble I can toss together for breakfast with some leftover veg in my fridge. This, coupled with some hash browns that were also underseasoned, made for kind of a disappointing experience, considering I'd heard good things about this place and was expecting something funkier and more flavorful for a place on Willy St. I'm all for good simple breakfast food but if you're going for simple, I think it should be executed really well. The saving grace of the meal were the scones we picked up on the way out - a cherry one and a coffee chip one. They were buttery, rich, and delicious. I can't say I'd order the scramble again but think I'd come here for the baked goods and also to try another dish on the menu because the atmosphere is exceedingly pleasant."}
{"text":"Yes Lazy Jane's is very Willy streetish! The scrambled eggs with cream cheese and onions was excellent.The breakfast potatoes, crispy bacon, and scones we're very satisfying! They do have there own small parking lot to make things easier."}
{"text":"I have zero complaints about Lazy Jane's. The service was quick, even though they were busy. Free coffee refills and the best scones I've ever had! We tried the lemon cream and the blackberry - both were amazing. My husband had The Works (traditional breakfast plate), and I had a special that was a Greek scrambler (can't remember the name). Everything was fresh and well made. The environment is really cute and cozy - definitely a place to take your time and enjoy. It's cash only, and they have an atm inside."}
{"text":"L.O.V.E.D I.T.  Staff was friendly and the atmosphere was warm and comfy.  An old house converted, the upstairs seating offers more opportunity not to be in the thick of things downstairs.  Tables are scattered about along with cozier seating areas of armchairs and couches.  Decor is kitschy and includes a few smatterings of Christmas decor despite the fact that it's May.  Let's be festive, fine by me!   

At 11am on a Friday the place was bustling but tables were free without having to stalk (weekdays are probably the time to go, based on what I'm reading here... I never have the patience to deal with crowded shenanigans on a weekend).  Our food was ready in minutes and super tasty.  The Seitan Hash ($7.50) is served with marinated seitan (YUUUUM), potatoes & peppers along with a side of eggs & toast.  The Frittata ($7.50) was equally delish, nicely portioned (not overwhelmingly large) with fresh veggies and cheese on top.  Remember to load your plate up with any condiments (ketchup, jelly, etc) you may need before getting back to your table.  My only kvetch was that the jelly jars weren't labeled so I spent more time than the average bear trying to distinguish between red jams.  Cash only but overall things were quite reasonably priced, me thinks.  

Note: they do switch over from the breakfast to the lunch menu at 11am  (weekdays only) and staff did go through the line to determine who was there for breakfast before they made the official lunch switch (which consisted of flipping menu chalk boards around and declaring it would be lunch-only once new folks wandered in.  Fair enough!  Baked goods were tasty as well and it appears on weekends there is a bakery annex (for to-go bakery goods) to alleviate some of the restaurant crush --annex open from 7am-11am/12pm, probably whenever they run out!    

While I may not be brave enough to try my hand on a weekend, this is definitely a stop I'd add to my itinerary for weekday adventures."}
{"text":"Lunch, then coffee and a scone.  Lunch: 3.  Coffee: 4.  Scone: 5.

Total. About 3.5.

Starting with the best:  The great scone -- raspberry, slightly heated, cheerfully,  at my request -- was just moist enough, crumbly, with a nice lemon glaze.  Not too sweet, not too rich. Light and tasty.  Just what a scone should be.  Nice size, too.  Couldn't ask for more.  Except now I want to try all of them!!

Latte: quite fine.  Not memorable, but piping hot with good coffee/milk balance.  I have to have decaf (sigh) and it was almost strong enough, and not bitter.  I'm a visitor, so I  haven't had all the local coffees...a solid 4.  I remember Bradbury's as better espresso.

The tomato soup could have been a 4, but wasn't hot, and seemed a skimpy serving.  Both chunky and creamy, it had potential.  I think the bowl was barely half full, and the accompanying half sandwich was also small and a bit sad.  A few pieces of pastrami, a tomato slice, a small cheddar half-slice, and a limp lettuce leaf.  I saw someone else's veggie melt with salad and chips and it looked much better, so maybe I just chose wrong.

It was a pleasant place to sit and eat and work.  Next time, I will try breakfast instead of a sandwich.  Got there too late this time (yesterday.)"}
{"text":"They have amazing amazing pastries! I can't get over their almond croissant!! I'm usually pretty picky about scones, but their scones are so perfect (for me at least). Their food menu is a bit limited, but simple and gooood. I have tried the chorizo scramble and the guacamole omelette. Both great. I love the salsa that comes with it too! Their regular coffee is good and they offer free refills for mugs, and I'm usually pretty happy with 2 cups. The ladies who work in the front are so bubbly and pleasant. I usually dock a star for things like environment, ease of parking, and restaurant capacity. Lazy Janes is surprising large, homey, and has a lot of seating. They also have their own parking lot. However, tables fill up fast and the cafe stays full until the kitchen closes. The upstairs area is my favorite! it is so cute with a variety of chairs / couches."}
{"text":"Their blueberry scone was the tastiest thing I've ever had! I am not usually a fan of sweets, but this hit the spot!

Cute, cozy little place. Hot fresh coffee. I tried one of their specials, which was a balsamic portobello melt. It was really hard to eat because it was drenched in balsamic, but between the scone and the coffee I was satisfied. 

Great prices and atmosphere. Would love to come back for another flavored scone! ^_^"}
{"text":"I stopped here for lunch and pleasantly surprised by the swift and pleasant service. The food is tasty and the atmosphere is very enjoyable as well. Good sandwich, coffee and tea options. The sitting area is a little cramped, but not too bad!"}
{"text":"Awesome brunch place!!!

It's always packed but you get seated in 10 and food comes by 20. 

Scones are delicious!!!! I love the savory ones! Quiches are great too. If you only want pastries, just walk down a couple of doors on the weekend and there's the pastry shop! And you can save the wait!

I also LOVE pigs in a blanket!! How has anyone not done sausage in pancakes before?! The Mac and cheese pancakes with andouille sausage are really good too!!

I also love the speedy eggwich, if you're into something simple :).  

My new favorite is the grits with sausage patties on the side!! Best thing ever and I always have leftovers!!! :):)"}
{"text":"Amazing scones!  Great breakfast food.  All around wonderful little place."}
{"text":"While visiting Madison from KCMO, this place was recommended for brunch. Yay! We loved it. You order at the counter and then wait to be called back for your food order. I liked that I could order some a la carte items. I ordered the the Pig in a Blanket, and added an egg as a side. Also had some delicious hot chocolate. I really liked the mixed thrift store plates, and retro tables and chairs. There is seating upstairs and downstairs. If you find yourself in Madison, this would be a great place for breakfast, brunch or coffee."}
{"text":"Cash only!  ATM in-house.

The east side's quintessential breakfast spot.  Yummy food, neat seating, and they've got the food to back up their sass and humor.  Getting anything egg-related will leave you feeling happy, and then you can trundle on down to Batch Bakehouse to round out your breakfast feast."}
{"text":"Food is well made and tasty. Interesting interior and atmosphere. Good Italian soda. Good brunch place, but there are some better places in Madison. 

Probably deserves 4 stars if it was not for the following. No fresh juice.  No outdoor seating. A little slow. They don't take any cards."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints. They have it down to a science... Fresh food, prepared in a kitchen the size of a postage stamp by a staff who look like they were born on Willy St. The scones are incredible, the coffee strong, the scrambles inventive and the crowd a constant. In an effort to cut down on my intake I ordered a scone and two poached eggs, soft. My eggs were nothing short of perfect. A rare treat. Line appeared daunting but it moved quickly. Do not be deterred. Worth the wait."}
{"text":"As with everything amazing, be prepared to wait in line. I love everything on the menu, they had the best GF Scone I have EVER had.  Whenever I have a chance I visit.  Great place for some out of towers or even some West siders to visit and get a feel of East side Madison."}
{"text":"\"SCONES!!!!!\" to quote Ashley H.
I had a coworker mention they had a scone from here about two weeks ago that was heavenly so I had to go in and try them! I've been here before but mostly for their breakfast offerings.
This time around I came for an early lunch.
This place has delicious fresh foods with a lot of bang for your buck. 
I wish i could get here more often it's just such a great place.
Wonderful coffee and lattes. SCONES as we mentioned before- I had the lemon.
And the sandwiches are yum!!
A great value, I took my latte and scone to go becasue after getting my sandwich and realizing it came with a green salad and some chips for under $8.00. \"Mind Blown\"
I had to save the rest of my scone for later. My total check was under $15 and I pretty much had enough food to get me by until dinnertime."}
{"text":"Scones are incredible and the flavor combinations are creative. Had the orange coconut and white chocolate along with the raspberry and lemon cream. Took 6 home from the bakery next door and they lasted about 18 hours after we got home. Of course, not knowing that scone utopia awaited, I inadvertently made the mistake of ordering a full breakfast. Oh well. Worth it."}
{"text":"We went here for brunch on a Saturday morning. It was packed, and we barely got a table, even after waiting for a few minutes even after our food/coffee was ready. It seems a lot of people sit for hours after finishing their food/coffee, and despite announcements made out loud, they don't get up from their tables. This is counter service, with a small kitchen window where you pick up your coffee and food, and then find a table to sit. It's self bus at the end, but the dining areas are scattered throughout the house. Still, the food was good, as was the coffee, and the ambiance was unique, so I'm sure we'll go back - probably at a less busy time."}
{"text":"The line outside the door is hard to deal with especially when you don't want to hear everyone's cheerful banter about all the great things they're doing in life.  And when you're hungry, 30 minutes is too long to just order.

I order a chorizo scramble with pumpernickel bread, a lemon scone, and hot apple cider.  The cider was advertised to satisfy my seasonal craving but it truly did not.  Seriously lacking spices and warm at best.

The chorizo scramble didn't taste of chorizo, but rather a cheap American version of the sausage that had no bite.  

I'd come back for the scones, but who wants to wait 30 minutes for a mouth watering scone??"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic PLACE to eat. Great people, interesting, cozy. The food is great. Almost a hipster place, but not quite."}
{"text":"The woman who works at the front counter is so rude, I've never been so mistreated at a restaurant, as well as my three friends who met me there. She stood there with a smug look on her face and refused to answer any questions about the menu."}
{"text":"East side GEM. A little old house converted into a breakfast/brunch joint. I've been several times and the food is always great. Sweet, savory... it's all good. 

There are lots of really good brunch spots in Madtown, but Lazy Jane's is up at the top."}
{"text":"Arrive at the wrong time and you'll wait for 45+ minutes in line to order, which is what happened to us. The good news was that food came pretty quickly once we had ordered.

I had the frittata with veggies, and my fiance had the biscuits and gravy. My frittata was a little bland and didn't have as many veggies as I had hoped. The cheese should be in the center not just on top. The biscuits and gravy were pretty good though. 

However, we ordered a bunch of pastries to go, and those were what really stood out. The sun dried tomato pesto and Asiago cheese croissant was amazing. As were the variety of scones we tried. Apparently you can pick up the baked goods at the bakery a few doors down and avoid the cafe line,  which is what I'll do next time!"}
{"text":"Saturday morning at 9:30 and we ran into a half hour wait out the front door.  They moved things along quickly though.  I ordered their chorizo scrambler with potatoes and toast  on the side.  The scrambler was excellent, although I'll be back some day to try the frittata, which sounded just as good.  The interior of the place has a certain festive purple theme that feels something like Mardi Gras.  There were a handful of families eating here too, and the fairly spacious setup seemed right for a meal with kids.  All around, a great spot for breakfast.

One heads up though - they only take cash and while there is a low cost in-house ATM ($1.75 fee), there are no Chase ATM's anywhere nearby, as far as we could find out."}
{"text":"I was in Madison this weekend and I am glad I was able to make it back to LJ's! I had the S.C.C. this time and it was wonderful! The S.C.C. is scrambled eggs, cream cheese (yuuuum) and chives mixed together served with hash browns and your choice of toast. LJ's also has gluten free bread!! My brekkie was delish and I just love this little eatery. 

My party of four also shared a mud pie scone while we waited for our food. It was divine!!"}
{"text":"I can't imagine I haven't written a review for this place. This was the among the first places I fell in love with after moving from NYC. It's these types of typical local small business I loved in NEw York. 

When ever we visited, the food has been consistently good. To my surprise, they have started accepting credit cards as well which is great. 

We started with a coffee and morning bun and a blueberry scone. Which were amazing. I must say- if u don't start with their treats, u are missing something. 

I ordered cheesy grits, pig in a blanket, my friends ordered frittata, steak and hash with toast. I loved my cheesy grits. Oh.. they were so good. Everyone loved what they were eating. I could tell because their plates were wiped out clean at the end. 

The line was long and we had to wait a bit but it was so worth it. I gave 4 stars because of coffee. It's a breakfast place and I was expecting the coffee to be better. It didn't have body and I was hoping for more flavor. 

All in all, a must visit for breakfast lovers."}
{"text":"Such a cute location! Service and food was excellent! Completely agree with the other reviews, the scones are amazing, my parents and I shared the lemon cream and the coffee chip. Super accommodating to modifications with the order. I order the \"speedy eggwich\" with bacon - excellent. My mother got \"the works,\" she thoroughly enjoyed it. My father ordered the \"chorizo scramble,\" he enjoyed his meal as well. The portions are a good size for the price. The side of potatoes was not my favorite, I prefer them super crispy. Next time I will just specified that I would like them well done."}
{"text":"A FUN dining experience!  And wonderful bakery items.  I don't like trying to listen for my name to be called because it's hard to hear.  But I think it's great how people literally make themselves at home, bringing board games to the table while they wait, etc."}
{"text":"Interesting place. Ordered the crazy pastrami omelet with blue cheese. Very tasty. Well worth the wait. I'd recommend and return. Plenty of seats upstairs too"}
{"text":"Love this place! One of the best places to get awesome b-fast. Especially vegan b-fast. I love that they ask you when you order the tofu scramble if you're vegan and tailor your diet to the available bread and butter options.  Just try to not go during prime time otherwise your wait is going to be forever, but it's still worth it! They also do take out and the coffee is delicious."}
{"text":"Pro:
-great location near bike path
-hip crowd
-OK diner style food
-eclectic decor

Con:
-exceedingly hot in building
-noxious bathroom odor
-relatively long wait
-griddle stench head to toe upon leaving
-cold potatoes
-hip crowd"}
{"text":"Not sure I understand where all the good ratings are coming from.  The \"scones\" are not scones in the traditional sense, but rather glorified biscuits that are really nothing special.  And as for the breakfast... we could have made way better at home.  Both the  strata and traditional plates were extremely boring and bland.  Definitely not worth the wait or the money.  If you want something amazing?... go to Daisy or just make it yourself."}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to visit Lazy Jane's this past weekend while I was in town visiting my sister. This is her favorite place and she was dying to take me here. I loved it as well!! Great food, awesome bakery (the scones were great as were the almond croissants) and the price is super affordable. I had the veggie frittata and my sister had the seitan hash and both were delicious. My hubby had the chicken salad on a croissant and my brother had a scrambler with pastrami and veggies and it was all delicious as well. I already can't wait to go back and try some more of their delicious food, I highly reccomend it here. Everyone was super friendly and because it was our first time here we got free scones, yum!"}
{"text":"Lazy Jane's is the place I have to convince all my friends to go try, (a bit of a haul from campus) but then they end up loving it. Probably the best all-around breakfast spot in Madison with a prefect balance of quality, price, portion size, and atmosphere. 

Food is top-notch and always made to order. Has a very \"homey\" feel operating out of a renovated house on Willy Street. Pastries are enormous and pretty tough to pass up since they're just staring at you as you order. 

Their system is also pretty efficient, you just order at the counter and grab a buzzer. Food usually comes out in less than 10 minutes. Between a pastry and a skillet, you'll be full until dinner.

Always worth the trip, even if the line is out the door."}
{"text":"Update: came in this morning. It was pretty slow, so the staff wasn't busy. I very obviously was interrupting their conversation. Was asked basic questions. Woman at the counter did not say thank you, just \"mmhmm\" and immediately grabbed her phone and continued her conversation before I was even done signing the tablet. 

The ladies behind the counter are being incredibly loud. And loudly gossiping about who I am assuming is another coworker. Uncomfortable environment. 

Customer service is still severely lacking here. The product is great, guys! Don't ruin it with poor customer service!"}
{"text":"Even their GLUTEN FREE scones are great! Therefore, it was incredibly disappointing to find none available during 2 recent visits. Staff offered some vague excuse about the availability of rice flour. Really? You could walk 2 blocks to the Willy St Coop to buy it in a pinch. Come on, LJ - GF folks like your scones, too!!"}
{"text":"Been back several times and have not had nearly as much of an issue with the air quality.  Not sure if that is luck of the draw or an improved hood.  The food is still quite acceptable for the price and the location is great."}
{"text":"Highly recommend the avocado with pepper jack cheese on sourdough even if you're not a vegetarian! Delish kettle chips and salad (light dressing). The scone was good....but the frosting/cream on the lemon currant scone was a little too sweet for me. I will definitely go back to try their other scones..."}
{"text":"Phenomenal scones. They have a unique breakfast and brunch menu that is very tasty but you have to go for the scones. The scones are made fresh every day and go quickly, so get there early. If you get there by 9 am there will still be a full selection of scones, including gluten free. 

My favorite scone is the lemon gluten free. I don't normally bother to do a GF diet, but these things are fantastic. Buy one for breakfast and one to snack on later that day. By the way, they are huge and probably the best value around based on size and price alone. 

The only drawback to LJs is that it is so popular there is frequently a line out the door and you might have to wait for a table. Try the breakfast and brunch menu on a quiet day and come back on a busy day just for the scones. 

Fun tip: the fry cook yells out your name for order pickup loud enough to hear it on the second floor. Yes, it's pick up your own order and clean your own table but the low prices are worth serving yourself (plus no tip needed)."}
{"text":"I have two words for you: MORNING BUN. Sweet baby Jerome those things are delicious- wholly worth a visit alone BUT luckily there are plenty of other reasons to visit, too! Like the huevos rancheros, seitan scramble, vegan/gluten free options, AND delightful decor! I'm so deeply charmed by the folksy interior that they could probably serve old boots and I'd still come back. Love, love, LOVE you Lazy Jane's!"}
{"text":"I am updating my previous review.
Since the first time, I have tried the scones, which are pretty amazing... most places just have basic, dry scones but these were moist (I hate that word) and they have at least 6 different options!  They are so good!  
I went there on Tuesday with some girlfriends and got the seitan hash for $6.50... Holy fricken moley! Amazing! This is a superb vegetarian dish that tastes just like meat!  It comes with the seitan seasoned to perfection, breakfast potatoes, 2 eggs, and your choice of toast (go for the sourdough rye).  This breakfast was so good, I made the bf bike there with me Wednesday morning... Yup, the very next day!  I could eat this meal every single morning!"}
{"text":"No credit cards?  No way.  It's 2013.  And I don't buy the \"it's too expensive for us little guys\" stuff.  No, it's the cost of doing business.  I saw a woman taking cards at a garage sale last year.  Your call, but the food isn't that good and I can get great eats and kitch ambience anywhere in Madison."}
{"text":"Start a lovely weekend brunch out on Willie Street at this gem! I love Willie Street and my love for it was even more enforced after going here! From entering this place to ordering to sitting down and just enjoying the atmosphere, take a look at what I ate during my visit!
* Lemon Cream Scone: scrumptious! Moist on the inside and deliciously sweet and creamy on the outside with the lemon glaze.  Drink it with some tea and it's a ridiculously great start to the morning. 
* Soy Chai: and speaking of tea, grab this latte! While it was a little dirty spiced than I usually like it still hit the spot and the mug it comes in is just great. 
* Veggie Scramble: Fresh and filled with yummy goodies including spinach, mushrooms, and tomatoes. On top of that it comes with a biscuit that goes perfectly well with the jam that is in array in the condiments section. 
I loved the homey feel of this restaurant including the décor and closeness of all its patrons. Definitely a place to check out if you're in the area and in the mood for a home feel breakfast."}
{"text":"This is a lovely and affordable breakfast spot on Willy Street. I really like that this is one of those order at the counter places as it makes me feel more relaxed and less rushed when I'm eating. The staff was really friendly and from the looks of things there were a lot of people there that are regulars. Overall, my experience here makes me want to be more of a regular as well! 

First off, the scones are excellent. I even decided to save a little bit of $$ by ordering a day old blueberry and it was still delicious. They have a rich, strong brewed coffee as well, which is a must with any breakfast. 

I ordered a breakfast of scrambled eggs, an English muffin, breakfast potatoes, and turkey sausage. The turkey sausage had a really nice flavor kick to it and the breakfast potatoes were delicious as well. The scrambled eggs were pretty standard.

Just a small note: If you are coming during winter and you get cold very easily like me, make sure you have a light sweater or long-sleeve under your coat as there was a pretty strong draft coming from the windows."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast spot in Madison. I ordered the waffle with berries and cream. This is the best waffle I ever had. Absolutely delicious. We also ordered eggs, potatoes, and toast with a side of bacon. This was good also."}
{"text":"This is a very nice breakfast & lunch place on the near-east side of Madison.  The scones are, by far, the best that I have ever had in any city (my personal favorite is the cherry scone)!  While I have never headed her for lunch, every breakfast entree that I have tried has been quite good, and there are always a wide array of specials in addition to the set menu.  There are also many options for both vegetarians and omnivores.

The only downfall in my opinion is the seating process.  While it's a piece of cake during slower times, it can be mass chaos during the rush (which is more often than not, especially on the weekend).  If everyone were to wait until after they ordered to secure seating it might work well, but there are always those people who save places and then get in line.  Seating for groups larger than 4 can be quite a tall order.  I would say that this is the main factor that keeps me from heading to this establishment more often than I currently do."}
{"text":"Lazy Jane's is one of the true gems of Madison. I love bringing out of town guests here. The food is amazing and the eclectic decor is so representative of its east side location. 

Today I had the caprese scramble: eggs with tomatoes, mozzarella and basil. It was wonderful. 

I often have the scramble with cream cheese and scallions. I like it so much I crave it.

Don't forget to get your scone on while you're there, or take one to go. I'm not kidding, you'll never eat anything like it. They are so good I have bought them for work events at the office."}
{"text":"I liked the location and setting inside the restaurant. It has a homey, comfy feeling. They support local artists by selling crafts inside the store. Their lemon cream scone was amazing! Definitely one of the best scones I have ever had. The consistency and taste was delicious. As for the actual breakfast, I had eggs, potatoes and bacon, which were good, normal. Really though, it gets a good review for the scone! I went on a late sunday morning and it was crowded but we only waited about ten minutes to get to the front of the line to order."}
{"text":"I say this as a guy who really, legitimately loves breakfast restaurant. This is my FAVORITE breakfast restaurant anyplace, ever. 

If there were one thing I didn't like about Lazy Jane's, it's that it is so good, that word has gotten out, so it gets crowded at peak times. Pro tip, go early, and you can enjoy a fabulous meal *with elbow room*.

I had the seitan scrambler, and everything was just perfect. The seitan (it's wheat gluten, naturally has a consistency a lot like tofu) was seared to perfection, which gave it a real neat and enjoyable texture. Almost like a steak. The marinade gave it the nicest twang. The potatoes were spot on, and my scrambled eggs came off flawlessly.

It was simultaneously a hearty breakfast, really artfully executed, with a little bit of hippy flair. Love it! Will def be back."}
{"text":"The scones: the best thing I put in my mouth while in Madison. I know, you're surprised. And don't get me wrong... the cheese, the ice cream, the beer, the Farmer's Market -- all great -- but the SCONES. For some reason, I've been generally non-exposed to scones. In my mind, they were akin to biscotti (dry, crumbly, desperate to be dipped in tea). No, friends. They are more like my (and every true Southerner's) best friend, the biscuit -- the perfect balance of light/dense, not overly dry, and beautifully buttery, pushed over-the-top thanks to a light-touch glaze. At Lazy Jane's they come in an assortment of flavors. The blueberry was bursting with in-season berries; the lemon, subtly tart; the cheddar, an amazing savory scone; chocolate chip scone, like a biscuit brownie! The only pastry letdown was the morning bun, which by comparison, was bland and surprisingly dry; skip it.

I found the spot incredibly charming. Waiting in line to order, peering in the pastry cases, and at the hand-written specials. Though we got there fairly early on Sunday, they were quite busy. Luckily, we snagged a great seat upstairs. The house is decorated with eclectic antique finds, and feels like an oh-so-cozy brunch spot. Yogurt with granola was inadequately portioned (more like: granola with yogurt), though the granola was crunchy, hearty, and delish. I thought the chorizo scramble was a win, but hubby was less impressed. Cash only is a little annoying. But ultimately worth it!"}
{"text":"Lovely little two story cafe in a fantastic neighborhood!  The crew is jovial and the food; especially the scones, are out of this world.  One of a kind chef creations are featured daily for those who tire of the standard fare."}
{"text":"There is nothing lazy about Lazy Jane's in regards to the food and service.  Lazy Jane's has quality food and an ambience to match.  

I ordered the seitan hash and roasted tomato and pesto croissant.  Both items were exceptional.  The hash was seasoned well and was cooked perfectly.  The seitan was not dried out and had a nice chew, which was great because sometimes if done wrong it's like rubber.  At Lazy Jane's, it was made perfectly.

The roasted tomato pesto croissant though, was the star of the show.  Nothing against the hash it was great, but the croissant was one like I've not experienced before.  It was buttery, flaky, light, and just amazingly well put together.  The croissant alone was fantastic, but add the roasted tomato pesto filling, and you're in a whole different class.  I've not had a croissant with filling before, but I will be seeking them out after this experience.  The filling enhanced the croissant because it brought more balance to the croissant.  The rich butteriness of the dough was evened out by the sweet tart tomato pesto filling, and I wish I had bought more (but couldn't I got the last one, so be there early).  The croissant is a must try.

The food was exceptional, but I would be doing you a disservice if I did not speak about the ambience of Lazy Jane's.  It's a home, and I mean that.  Lazy Jane is a home converted in a restaurant, but it did not lose it's \"homey\" feel.  The hospitality and service given was great, and you just feel comfortable as if you were visiting a relative's house.  The atmosphere definitely contributed to the experience at Lazy Jane's.

Everything about Lazy Jane's was great, and if you haven't been, you are missing out.

Side Note: The scones were also amazing.  I bought 3 different ones the blueberry, strawberry peach, and coffee chip and all were just phenomenal.  Buy some for the next day because if you don't you'll regret it."}
{"text":"Needed to try a new place for breakfast on a day off of work, and was very happy with my choice. 

Ordered at the counter and waited an appropriate amount of time for them to call my name. Picked up some silverware and a napkin and headed to my table. I was a little disappointed there wasn't any jelly for my toast, but I noticed later, after I'd finished my toast, there was a jar at another table and they just hadn't returned it to the community condiment table. 

Ordered the spicy pork omelette, which was hot and delicious and came with a perfect sized portion of potatoes and two slices of buttered toast. 

Now I'm just hanging out at my table waiting for someone to leave because I don't know if I'm supposed to bus my own table! Wait... Someone's leaving... Yes. Bus your own table."}
{"text":"Obsessed with this place! Cute brunch place with a lot of gluten free pasteries that actually taste good! This place is cash only"}
{"text":"we made the mistake of going to lazy janes on a sunday at 11am. The line was out the door, and seating was difficult. however the atmosphere is great. a fantastic place to bring kids. They have a child play area upstairs. The place itself is well decorated. and the food was good. however, on a sunday at 11am- expect to wait. i think we waited at least a half an hour for our food. at least."}
{"text":"Until recently I had only ever been here for breakfast. However, their lunch is just as tasty! Ambiance is great, healthy options while still having that comfort food feel. Must have the hazelnut coffee"}
{"text":"A blackberry lemon scone and my mint tea were a perfect afternoon treat.  Visiting Madison for the week, it felt more like home as I enjoyed conversation with the sweet owner of Lazy Jane's."}
{"text":"I was greeted immediately and personably by a friendly woman and man. They recommended bakery items based on my interests, as well as a breakfast sandwich. They also offered flavored iced coffee, which is a rare find because many places will flavor with syrup, but not cold brew a flavored coffee. Food was great; service was genuinely friendly. I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Great little breakfast place.  Service is fairly fast once you get through the ordering line.  The food was all fantastic and I enjoyed the coffee.

Jane ain't lazy in the kitchen."}
{"text":"This is becoming an east side institution, run by a family who also owns Mickeys, Tip Top and other solid spots across Madison.

Great ambiance in this fun little breakfast place. It's hard to find parking or a table because it's that good. Lunch sandwiches come with chips and greens. For breakfast, get the Works: toast, choice of meat, skillet potatoes, and two eggs.

I like to make up a name for them to yell, usually Ignatious. Stella is so overdone.

If I owned this place, I'd do checks and cash only, just like they do, to avoid CC companies from takingmy hard earned money from customers. Pay in cash."}
{"text":"There are scones and then there are scones made from Gods. Lazy Jane has perfected the scone and brought it down from the heavens for us all to share and enjoy. Because of the scone, I have become a regular to this brightly colored two story house, stopping by to grab a scone and a coffee on my way to work. Outside of their blessed scones, their breakfast and lunch food is also truly amazing. I recommend grabbing your cash, getting there early to avoid the lines and order an amazing breakfast with a scone to go. While you wait for your name to be called out by the fun loving chefs, nibble on your scone and enjoy coffee. Once you have enjoyed your breakfast, take whatever remains of your unearthly scone with you to savior for later!"}
{"text":"We have always like Lazy Jane's.  The staff are always friendly and courteous.  Lazy Jane's is nestled in the heart of one of the best neighborhoods of its' type in Madison, Willy Street.  The menu has not changed much in the years that we have been going here.  Always a special of the day to consider.

The bakery is first rate.  I think they are some of the best scones we have had.  Coffee is good.  Never tried the espresso drinks.

The food is average +, but more than made up for by the fun eclectic atmosphere.  If you are put off by having to wait to order, wait for a table, be self-seated then Lazy Jane's  is not for you.  But if you don't mind waiting in line and gabbing with strangers then you will be o.k. here.

Our last visit the food was good.  Had The Works breakfast.  Very good.  Only criticism was that my potato's were a bit on the oily side, and the toast was a bit on the verge of being burnt.

All-in-all Lazy Jane's warrants a \"recommend\" if you are in the area."}
{"text":"A for atmosphere and friendly staff! :) Such a busily chill place to go-- the chairs are all different, there are little jars of jams all over, everyone buses their own table, and when your order is ready, they happily call your name across the restaurant. 

I got the frittata which came with potatoes and toast, all delish. I was having a hard time deciding about what to get because the pastries looked good too (typically I opt to get one of evvvvvvverything) but when I told the cashier it was my first time there and how excited I was, she gave me not one, but TWO free scones! I picked a walnut-pesto scone, and she was like, \"Well, scones are supposed to be sweet, and that one's savory, so have this one, too!\" and gave me a lemony cream scone. 

Mmmm. Too much food for one girl to handle, but great leftovers for later. Great vibe, good food, friendly people. It gets busy but is worth hitting up, even to study and drink tea with a scone. 

Hint: they have mimosas! 
Double hint: they do not take credit cards."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast, this was our first visit. This place is so Madison. I never had an eggplant omelet before and it was wonderful fresh and delicious. The scones were really good as well, some of the best bakery I have ever had. Friendly helpful staff, parking available on the side of the building."}
{"text":"The good: the atmosphere is great. Chalkboard menus, baked goods on display, Christmas decorations already up (nov 2).

The bad: the gingerbread latte was a little bitter. The potatoes were a little dry.

The ugly: my buddy Will that I went with."}
{"text":"Lazy Jane's is delicious! 

The scones are probably one of the best I've ever had, but the brunch/breakfast menu is just as good!

The first time I was at Lazy Jane's I opted for the french toast with fresh berries and real whip cream (real whip cream is already a game changer). It tasted amazing and it was really hard not to just go round two the second time I visited, but I switched it up and went savory with the chorizo scramble. I swear I could eat that every day! 

The coffee is also a win, the atmosphere is chill and comforting, all of which make this an excellent place to ease into your weekend mornings.

PS. Be sure to have cash on hand as they do not accept cards. They do have an ATM at the location, but with a line waiting for this deliciousness, you don't want to have to step out last minute because you are out of cash."}
{"text":"Soooo good.  I'm a sucker for scones over any other pastry and couldn't resist a blueberry one.  It wasn't too sweet and had just the right amount of moisture.  The scone definitely has a lemon flavour but it compliments the blueberries loaded in the treat.  The density was perfect and the icing/glaze wasn't overpowering.  It's making my current bus ride to Minneapolis bearable.

I also had a quick sandwich (I've already forgotten its actual name...) but it was egg, sausage, and cheese open-faced on a larger than average English muffin.  Filled me up for the morning and the egg wasn't overcooked.  Solid.  

The folks working were friendly, quick, and extremely flexible.  A long line had formed by the time my friend and I got there but we were helped in no time."}
{"text":"I have been to Lazy Janes many times and enjoyed each experience! First of all the ambience is very cute as the restaurant is located in an old house on Willy street and filled with interesting knick knacks and furniture. You order at the counter and it is self serve for silverware and water. At peak time this can cause some congestion. They now take credit cards.

While Lazy Janes is most known for their breakfast and scones, I am more of a lunch kind of person. I tend to get the soup and sandwich combo. Their tomato basil soup is so good. Very rich with nice chunks of tomatoes. I haven't had a sandwich of theirs I didn't like. I especially like the grilled cheese with delicious bread and smooth avocado to bring out the flavor of the cheese.

If you are looking for a delicious and eclectic lunch or breakfast option, be sure to check out Lazy Janes!"}
{"text":"Best scones I've ever had. Can't speak for the breakfast in the main bldg, but I stopped by yesterday to the \"annex\" for coffee and scones to go. I got the banana chocolate chip, orange coconut white chocolate, and cherry lemon creme ones. Wow. Wow. Wow. 

And on top of it all, the staff are so friendly. This place epitomizes what Madison is all about- top-notch quality and top-notch people, with a pleasant touch of hippie :)"}
{"text":"By far my favorite place for breakfast and brunch in Madison. Nothing compares to Lazy Jane's in terms of price, quality or atmosphere. 

Atmosphere - old 2 story house turned into a restaurant. Seating on the 1st and 2nd floor. Old mix of tables, chairs and couches to sit on. Menu is on the wall, you order at the counter, and when your food is ready the kitchen hollers out your name and you pick up your own food at the window. 

Staff - friendly hipster staff that always has a good suggestion on food. I have yet to be steered wrong. 

Coffee - free refills at counter. Just walk up and they will take care of you. 

Food - i have yet to have anything bad here. They have good vegetarian and vegan options as well. My all time favorite dish there is the Biscuits and Gravy. Its probably the best biscuits and gravy north of the Mason Dixon line. What makes ti so good? It's those \"holy cow\" biscuits. 

Desserts - Get a half dozen scones to go. Try one of each flavor. They are out of this world. They are made fresh daily and are probably the best scones i have ever had. 

Thank god the lazy undergrads refuse to come here for brunch. They are content with walking to Mickey's Dairy bar and we should all be happy about it, because if they ever discover this place en mass, the line will quadruple."}
{"text":"Great local spot.  Seating can be a bit of a problem and the line for ordering gets pretty congested on the weekends - just FYI.  Tasty foodstuffs.  Best hot cocoa in Madison."}
{"text":"This place has my favorite grilled cheese avocado sandwich. It's made sourdough bread with the perfect crunch. The sandwich comes with tomato, red onion, avocado and cheese (sorry I don't remember what kinds of cheese!) I love the salad they serve with the sandwich, it's a simple green salad with some kind of basil dressing...yummmm! It also comes with kettle chips. They now accept credit cards here!!!! Yay!!!!"}
{"text":"The hype is real! This place is beyond yummy! So first off, you order before you sit down. I ordered the berries and cream waffle - by far the best fluffiest waffle I have ever had. It must be the batter. It must be the berries. I can't seem to pinpoint what it is, but it's worth the try. I ended up only eating half and saving the rest for later. The blueberry pancake was huge with juicy blueberries. I also ordered the works with a sausage patty and sourdough toast. No complaints whatsoever. 

The decor inside is lovely and vintage. I love the hallway stairs that go up to their second floor right when you walk in because of the beautiful gold hanging mirrors. 

The service was excellent and I cannot wait to return and try their scones."}
{"text":"Lazy Jane's is a gem. Good food, great atmosphere, the perfect breakfast place on Willy St."}
{"text":"I needed a quick lunch a month ago, and hadn't been to lazy jane's in years. I stopped in, and was quickly disappointed to hear they were having hood problems and could not serve me a hot sandwich.

The counter helper recommended the Chicken Salad sandwich since they could only do cold sandwiches. I dislike chicken salad, but was easily persuaded. I have thought about that sandwich ever since that day. I look forward to picking one up again soon."}
{"text":"Great space for eating, especially upstairs. One of the best places in Madison to meet a friend for tea or coffee and talk. The veggie rueben is a surprise hit, expertly done and very filling. The 'real' rueben is also good, but actually not as good as their seitan rendition. The med plate is a generous portion of Wisconsin white-bread preparation. It's not bad, it's just really far from authentic. Breakfast here is pretty good.

The big attraction are the scones, which for my money are the best scones in Madison. Large, filling, delicious, and moist. 

It gets very busy here on the weekends but on most weekdays if you catch them at the tail-end of lunch you'll have a couple hours of comfortable open space in which to hang out, work, and eat."}
{"text":"We had a great breakfast here.  The coffee was piping hot and fantastic.  The eggs were cooked perfectly, and the Yukon gold breakfast taters were cooked and seasoned excellently.  Yummy bread for the toast and the jams were delish.  Way to go"}
{"text":"We were on Willy Street today.  Seemed like a good opportunity to try Lazy Janes.  So we did.  We asked the lady behind the register (owner? Manager?) for her favorites

She mentioned the avocado grilled cheese and a Rueben.  So that's what we had

And a blueberry scone.  She told us the sandwiches would come with a side salad with house basil dressing and chips.

We paid and sat down at a table after picking up some flatware and a couple glasses of water.

The food was quite good.  Good suggestions.  If I had a criticism it would be that the kettle chips were a bit too salty.

The scone had a lemony glaze.  Yummy!

Definitely worth another lunch."}
{"text":"I don't know how I haven't reviewed Lazy Janes yet. SCONES. SO MUCH HAPPY.

It's one of my favorite, favorite brunch places in Madison. Super low key (choose your own seat, get your own silverware, pick up your meal, bus your own table... you get the idea), delicious food, bottomless iced tea.. YAY. I enjoy ordering off their specials board because I get the most awesome things there! They had a spinach omelette with pesto and it was unreal, some other scramble type options that have been just great. I love their on-the-menu chorizo scramble too, so it's not just the specials! Their potatoes are so good, too. Nicely sized and seasoned.

Now that they also take credit cards, it's basically a perfect place.

My only qualm--the lines. Whew, you can wait for a while to order, and a while for the food. Overall worth it, but I hesitate coming here after 10am on the weekends."}
{"text":"The scones here were really tasty.  The wait was not too long, and we went prime time on a Saturday morning.  The portions were large and the prices were reasonable.  Service with a smile."}
{"text":"The wait is worth it for the scones alone. Sweet or Savory any flavor. Their lemon scones are a taste of summer that never fades away... a ray of sunshine in every bite. 
Your going to want to pick up extra for later.  CASH ONLY!"}
{"text":"My new favorite breakfast place in Madison! I love it! The scones are amazing, as is the what looks like homemade jam. I had the SCC - scrambled eggs and cream cheese and chives. YUM! Great eastside atmosphere and just a cozy, homey feel."}
{"text":"I visited this summer so I can't be too detailed-my memory sucks-but I definitely remember being satiated and pleased afterwards. I ended up getting two different full entres because I was on vacation and quit judging. Everything tasted fresh and well-seasoned. The coffee was also spectacular. It's a cozy place, reminded me of the anti-Starbucks. My only qualm would be the coffee refills, you have to get someone's attention from the kitchen to do it, which can prove awkward when it's busy."}
{"text":"They ask for gratuity at the register, then you bus your own table.  The food isn't super expensive, nor super good.  Nah...."}
{"text":"Hmm, I would really say this is around 3.5 stars.

As the co-owner of a pastry shop, I don't eat baked goods nearly enough. Not because we make any, because we don't, but because I try to pretend to eat healthy foods outside of work. I need to stop doing this, because you know what- baked goods are tasty. And Lazy Jane's are top, top notch.

The boyfriend had the morning bun (with sugar) and i had a blueberry scone. Both were deeeee-lish. The scone was rather moist (for a scone) with a slight lemony flavor.  The morning bun was like cinnamon sugar-dusted crack. Flaky and sweet, crusty on the outside, soft on the inside, pretty much perfect. And that was just to start!

I attempted to have a healthy breakfast and went with the granola with berries, bananas, and yogurt. The granola was pretty good, but the berries were frozen- rather, defrosted frozen berries. Which I guess is better than fresh berries in October, since berries are obviously out of season, but some of them were still partially frozen, and that just seems a little. . . cheap? I would have preferred something seasonal, like apples. Ooh- warm baked apples with granola and yogurt! That would have been good.

Boyfriend had a fritatta, his sister had some kind of scramble. He said his could have been a touch saltier.  

Good coffee, cute, homey atmosphere.  It's out of the way, so while it IS crowded, it's not teeming with college kids. So, that's good."}
{"text":"I have been here twice so far, love this cozy family style coffee house. It is a good place to gather together with friends and family. I love their scones the best! So many selections, always crowded!"}
{"text":"Today I woke up at 8am so I could get in to Lazy Jane's.  I should have slept in.

I tried their special of Biscuits and Gravy with two eggs.  The gravy tasted very greasy and had no depth.  It was just sausage gravy. I pepped it myself but otherwise it was bland.  The biscuits were SO dense. I could have used another side of gravy to soak them up. I live by the motto, no biscuit left behind.  Today, I had to leave one behind.  I left breakfast with an overall feeling of mediocrity.  I am so sad by this.

I tried my husband's breakfast potatoes. Also a disappointment. They alternated between cold and burnt. 

I probably will not be back."}
{"text":"Food is great... atmosphere is noisy but fun.... if there is a line (those in the know go in the side door and grab a table while others wait to order their food - otherwise you will never get one!)  

Some items on the menu due tend to run out.... especially if they are fresh."}
{"text":"I like Lazy Jane's--a lot.  Their scones are contenders for the coveted title of \"Best Scones in the World.\"  Particularly the cherry scones.  The other place is Oakhouse Bakery.   The rest of the food is good, too, but nothing I've had there can hold a candle to the scones.  I love the atmosphere very much, as well.

I'm not a fan of the line to order, the fact that they don't accept cards (yes, they do have an ATM), and that you have to sit down to wait for your order (if there's a place to sit, mind you!)--which might be upstairs--and they yell your name for you to come get it.  That's not so much my thing.  I prefer to have a conversation and not worry about whether they just said \"Heather\" or \"Hector\" (or even \"Richard\") over the din of the customers when I'm sitting upstairs."}
{"text":"I do come back here pretty regularly for their seitan hash.  The atmosphere is charming and a nice place to bring out of town guests.

I don't know that I'd call it my favorite breakfast place in town, but it's definitely a regular stop for me."}
{"text":"Aaaaah, the ol' LJ! I have been going here for a few years. I tend to avoid the Saturday and Sunday morning rush because we live in Wisconsin and I haven't been a fan of the cold weather.  However, wanting to eat on Willy St. seems to come with the price of standing and waiting outside more and more these days.  Some even say that standing is good for you... we'll see.  So, I would love for them to find a way around that use line, and I prefer to tip AFTER I get my services instead of right when I pay, but that's about it for the downsides.  LJ has bakery that is amazing and always there to temp you while you are waiting in line, and their food quality is always consistent, which is consistently appreciated. :-) I love me some thick bacon, breakfast potatoes and cheesy grits! There aren't a lot of places that offer up some grits these days, so I have to get them every single time... even if I know that I don't have room in my belly. Lastly, I miss the days when they would call out one's name when your food was ready.  They seem to have mainstreamed it with those coaster buzzers. Luckily I wasn't just going there to have someone yell my name out into a restaurant, so I will be okay.  Long story short: try it!"}
{"text":"Another great breakfast/brunch place in downtown Madison. I tried the bagelwich, which was a special item listed the time we were there. I was expecting something pretty basic, and it was, except it was twice as big! Potatoes were great, the bagel sandwich was great, but the best part about this place? The Leonaidus reincarnate cook downstairs yelling everyone's names when their food's ready."}
{"text":"It's love at first visit. Cute, homey decor AND delicious food?! I walked in expecting a very tiny, average looking space, but found so much more. Lazy Janes has about 25 seats downstairs and even more upstairs. This was quite enough for my needs at 2:30 on a Thursday, but I can see how it might be an issue on weekends. It looks like a sweet little cottage and is decorated accordingly. I got the tuna salad sandwich on a croissant and was pleasantly surprised by the quality and the portion size. The croissant was so flakey and buttery I COULD DIE. The side salad was pretty large and covered in a very delicious, clearly homemade dressing. Good sign, since I'm picky bout dressings! The potato chips were absolutely fab. And I just loved sitting there in the window light surrounded by a couple pairs of older ladies! Some cafes have intimidating clientele, especially in the hipster Willy St. neighborhood, but this one really did feel welcoming. This is my kinda cafe! Wish I discovered its wonders earlier. I'll be back for one of those famous scones."}
{"text":"Wonderful! Great food comes out fast. Excellent atmosphere for working, meeting friends, enjoying breakfast/lunch, reading, or just lounging with a cup of coffee. Delightful service :) For the quality of food and location, the prices surprised me - very affordable."}
{"text":"Lazy Jane's is just what everyone needs on a Sunday morning. The setting is adorable and very homey. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars and not 5 is because it was very hard to find seating. I would recommend going here if you have plenty of time to sit down and eat. 

I got the blueberry scone and chorizo scrambler.
The blueberry scone-WOW is all I have to say. As a person who is not a huge fan of sweet things for breakfast-Lazy Jane's scones changed my perspective on that forever. The scone crumbled perfectly when taking a bite and was burst with flavor when eating the blueberries. 

Chorizo scrambler with wheat berry toast- Nicely made. As a person who always likes a little spice in my meals, this was perfect for me. The chorizo and eggs blended nicely and the sweetness of the toast balanced the savory chorizo and eggs."}
{"text":"I really don't know what it is about Lazy Jane's. The antique-looking, house-shaped cafe doesn't have anything special on their menu; they mainly have very traditional American breakfast items as well as some pastries. There are no unique gimmicks unlike a lot of other popular Madison brunch menus. Somehow, they stand out by quality alone.

If I had to guess what Lazy Jane's secret it, I would have to guess butter. Their pancakes are so soft and chewy with a distinct buttery richness to them. Their biscuits have a crisp crust but a soft, buttery interior with the right amount of saltiness. Their scones are more dense than your typical scone. Even their scrambled eggs taste buttery compared to the ones I make at home. It's all delicious!

If you want to get your hands on this delicious brunch, be ready to wake up early or wait in line. I didn't have to wait when I went around 9 am or when I went near closing at 1 pm if that helps you plan your attack. Good luck!"}
{"text":"Pretty much the best place to get a morning bun that I can currently think of."}
{"text":"The best scones in town!!  Despite my 5 stars I do have a gripe.  Every time I head in there on a weekend the line is out the door and the place is uncomfortably packed in like sardines.  This can only be a testament to how loved Lazy Jane's really is.  I'm just selfish because I want this fab little place to my whole self!  Xo!  If visiting Madison, this place is a must!  The food is delish!  The scones are out of this world!  You'll feel like you've had a cozy breakfast at your nana's house!  :)"}
{"text":"Best. Scones. Ever. I love the strawberry-peach (so does everyone else; they sell out pretty early). Great breakfasts and lunches, too. My one beef: the orange juice is from concentrate! Ruins a perfectly good breakfast."}
{"text":"Best scones! All of their scones have a lemony base that I love. I take them home with me when I visit nearby family. The specials are reliably good and the service is very friendly. I appreciate that they have unlimited coffee refills and large water coolers on both floors to serve yourself. A very enjoyable brunch experience."}
{"text":"I loved Lazy Jane's! I felt like going meatless and ordered the seitan hash. It was flavorful and light, not greasy. The homey, mismatched decor is right up my alley as well. You have to try a scone, they are some of the best ever! The girl working was super friendly and helpful. I wish I could say the same about the other customers waiting in line. You will have to wait in line on a weekend, but it is worth it. Cash only, order and pay at the counter."}
{"text":"Lucky us!!! Line on a Saturday morning at 10 am was short and sweet. Haven't been to Madison for a while and every trip REQUIRES scones. So good. And. Which. By the way. Have gotten even bigger!!"}
{"text":"I came here as part of a brunch group, except that we arrived too late for brunch and got lunch instead. Being enmeshed both physically and culturally within the Willy Street community, I had high hopes and expectations, having had excellent experiences in neighboring establishments. Aesthetically, Lazy Jane's is perfect for the quirky disestablishmentarian feel - \"cozy hipsterism\" - with its tchotchkes on the counter, its mismatching plates, and its cash only policy. I was pretty excited to see that they had artichoke melts, so I got that with a cup of tomato and basil soup. This artichoke melt is very different from all of the other artichoke melt's I've ever had, and I've had plenty. You're supposed to smother the bread in mayonnaise, which they didn't. Also their tomato and basil soup was made with chunks of tomatoes instead of the tomato puree that one would traditionally dip grilled cheese sandwiches into. While the food isn't bad, I feel like the cooks make their food based on what they think it's supposed to be. \"Tomato and basil soup? OK let's see...throw some chunks of tomatoes and basil...salt and pepper...hmm maybe some cream to thicken it? Done!\" However, I was more confused than delighted by their unusual spins on these classics."}
{"text":"Maybe 3 1/2.   Lemon creme scone I love you!   It's loud, crowded, and you *will* wait on a weekend.  The service is also inconsistent as my ticket has been lost on two occasions (once they gave me a gift certificate to replace it after the 30 minute wait for my food!).  After a few years I've decided to skip the full on breakfast unless it's on a cold and snowy Tuesday  and go for the scones and coffee."}
{"text":"I visited Lazy Janes for the first time this weekend for breakfast. I heard lots of good things about the food and that didn't disappoint. If you've never been to Lazy Janes it looks and feels like a house that has turned into a small quaint restaurant. You order at the front, grab a buzzer and find a spot to sit. Then when your food is done, you go up to the window to grab it. You also clean up after yourself and out your dishes in a tub. 

I had the eggs, bacon and breakfast potatoes. I substituted the toast for a blueberry pancake. Everything was very good. My brother had a corn beef egg combo. He thought it was filling and delicious as well. I'll definitely go back if I'm looking for a hearty American style breakfast!"}
{"text":"I went to school at UW-Madison and this was one of my favorite brunch places in town. The service is good. Sometimes the wait was a little longer. However, the food definitely more than makes up for it! I always try to go here for brunch whenever I'm in town."}
{"text":"Do you ever wake up feeling like you want to have a great breakfast but also want to put zero effort in actually making it? When you're a broke college student that sounds like wishful thinking until you find a place like Lazy Jane's. 
I searched on Yelp for breakfasts near me and Lazy Jane's came up as one of the options. Not only, it had my mouth watered with scrumptious food pictures but also seemed very appealing with that two $$ sign on its bio. Only that kind of introduction would make me jump off of my bed early Saturday morning. 
I went to Lazy Jane's right away and I ordered a seitan scrambler and a lemon scone. It was literally one of the best food I have ever had in this town. It was fresh, tasty and timely. Honestly, nothing about this place is lazy like its name. ha! The food was quick, the interior of this cute place was so soothing for the eyes and home cooked food immediately won my heart. 

Overall the breakfast was hearty and delicious. 

*Pro Tip*: Get there a bit early and GET scones. The best you will ever have."}
{"text":"I wish I were more of a morning person, because I'd be more apt to frequent LJ's. The early bird definitely gets the worm in this case...or at least doesn't have to wait in line for eons. This place is always hoppin', hungry people come in droves.

I LOVE the SCC(eggs with scallions and cream cheese), and their scones are too pretty to eat--okay, who am I kidding. They are lovely, though. 

Don't expect a mellow, quiet morning spot. Between the comers and goers, the cooks shouting the names of customers when their order is up, it's craziness. Fun, frantic craziness. A must try!"}
{"text":"What a cute, cozy little breakfast cafe!

They serve an assortment of breakfast and lunch dishes, including several vegetarian and vegan dishes. Portion sizes are generous and will fill you up.

Their scones are delightful, never dry, and they're big enough to share!"}
{"text":"Yes, the line on the weekends can stretch out the door but you can't go wrong with anything you decide to order at Lazy Jane's.  Special shout out to all of their bakery items with their scones being the best sold anywhere in Madison proper.  Order at the counter and grab a seat.  Wait to hear your name called and dig in.  Great neighborhood spot with home cooked food."}
{"text":"I'm so very happy that Lazy Jane's is walkable for me! We bring all of our visiting friends and family here for the atmosphere, food and consistency.

Here's a typical weekend brunch visit (weekday mornings are super low key):

1. Arrive at a line out the door! Patiently observe the decor as you move inside. The staircase at the door leads up to the dining room.
2. Have your cash ready! Cash only, but there is an ATM. (Leave a tip in the jar!)
3. Pick a scone to nibble on while you wait for your breakfast. In my experience, the estimated wait time is an over-estimation. \"30 minutes\" was actually about 20 for us.
4. When you order coffee (which is delicious), you'll get one free refill.
5. If you'd like water, there are water coolers upstairs and downstairs with small glasses so you can serve yourself.
6. You'll be given a pager for when your food is ready (at less busy times, they'll shout whatever name you give them!)
7. The upstairs dining room is super cozy! Reminds me of being in an old (kind of run down) bed and breakfast. But totally charming!
8. When your buzzer goes off (or name is bellowed!) you can head over to the window and claim your meal. 
9. Be prepared for an awesome, generously portioned breakfast. I can never finish my food. Eggs and potatoes are not gourmet, but they are not greasy or sloppy like some diner-style breakfasts. Everything is always juuuuuuust riiiight.
10. Clean up your table and carry your dirties to a bus tub. It's the polite thing to do :)

The guys and gals who work the register are always beyond friendly. You can personalize your meat, toast & coffee choices. You'll leave satisfied and cheerful! At least I always do :)"}
{"text":"I recently had the pleasure of experiencing Lazy Jane on my trip to Madison, and I'm so glad that I made the trip to the east side to have brunch at this wonderful place. The line was out the door when I arrived, and it does take a while to make your way to the counter to order if that is the case. However, the service was incredibly friendly, and I enjoyed looking at all of the scrumptious baked goods and scones on my way to the cash register. 

I chose the chorizo scramble. It was amazing, and the portions were so large that I could not finish it. There were so many creative dishes to choose from, but I was certainly happy with this one.

The space is like a cute charming old house, and I enjoyed reading the New York Times while I had my coffee and breakfast. Kudos for the coffee refills too!"}
{"text":"I guess it's a fine place if you are looking for vegan options. Not a place I'd come back to"}
{"text":"I love everything about Lazy Janes!  The staff are awesome, friendly and hilarious!  They have the best scones in Madison!!! My personal favorite is the lemon scone...mmmmmm. Fortunately I live a block away and can walk there whenever I crave their coffee!!!"}
{"text":"Busy, busy place. Good food. Old rustic building like a large home opened up. I was alone so after standing in line for 15 min. Headed upstairs to find an open table by the window, drink my coffee (refills but have to go get yourself) & read my book. It took 20-30 min so glad I had a book. They call your name & you go pick up your food. I liked the place & the food.  If your coming with a larger group it may become hard to find a table. I suggest you find the times they are not so busy or spread your group out to take the first large table open. Then text."}
{"text":"Don't tell anyone but the primary reason I visit Madison is to eat the scones at Lazy Jane's.  The fact that my son also lives there? Coincidence."}
{"text":"The scones are delicious and the grilled cheese is buttery with the perfect amount of crunchiness and chewiness. But seriously, you need to get yourself a scone. Do it."}
{"text":"Back in June, I was spending a night in Madison on my way back to Chicago and put out a call on Twitter for suggestions of places to eat breakfast while I was there. When all four of the people I specifically asked suggested Lazy Jane's, I knew that was the place to go. I was absolutely won over by every aspect of this place.

The cafe itself was totally adorable, and the staff was super friendly. I loved the mismatched plates and silverware. The whole place had a very cozy, eclectic feel to it. And nothing makes you feel more welcome in a new restaurant then when they give you free food!  That's right, if you've never been to Lazy Jane's before they give you a few scone.

The food was delicious. I played it safe with the eggs, potatoes, and toast, but in retrospect, I wish I'd been a bit more adventurous. The breakfast potatoes were fabulous - and I'm VERY picky about my breakfast potatoes - and the scones were absolutely out of this world! We actually stopped at the bakery next door to pick up a couple to take back to Chicago with us.

I hear this place gets pretty crowded on the weekends, and I can understand why. However, it was only about half full, and there was no line, when we arrived about 9:30 Sunday morning. I chalked this up to fate, luck and the fact that the street it's on was totally torn up at the time.

I definitely understand why it was a unanimous suggestion among my friends."}
{"text":"This is such a cute and quirky lunch place - if you are in the area, you should check out this cute cafe!! They serve really great tea and coffee, as well as delicious soups and sandwiches. The decor and layout of the place is also fun. Great little gem!"}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite breakfast spots in Madison. It has a very cute eclectic vibe which matches Willy street perfectly. You line up to order and then find a seat after so there's never a wait for a spot. The breakfast food itself is fine pretty traditional, but the real standout is the baked goods. You absolutely cannot leave lazy Jones without a pastry of some kind. My all time favorites are their scones the blackberrry in particular, but all the flavors are great. If you're looking for a low-key affordable spot with consistently good food and outstanding pastries this is the spot"}
{"text":"First of all, I'm a little biased because I love breakfast food so much.  A restaurant really has to f up for me to rate a breakfast place poorly.  :)

My roomie and I have been talking about eating here for like over a year now and we finally did it this morning! Hurray!!!  Lazy Jane's is quite possibly the most adorable place I've ever eaten at.  Very homey and welcoming.   Also, they give you a free scone if it's your first time there!!!!  (We got ours to go and I have yet to eat my Blackberry scone because I'm still full from breakfast).   

I got The Works (eggs, potatoes, toast, bacon)....delish.  My roomie got their banana cream waffles...amazing.

Will definitely go back!

Edit: omg, by far the best scone ever."}
{"text":"The year is 2049. Some character, whose name we will not mention, is contently leading a life of spinsterhood with cats, knitted afghans, mismatching chairs, endless scones and peanut butter hot cocoa. If this spinster were to own a home it would be that of Lazy Jane's. She would join her friends for a veggie-friendly breakfast with dishes like tofu scramble with siracha and veggies. Her most difficult decision of the day would be blackberry jam or marmalade? 

While the crew waits for their number to be called they'd dote on the precious tableside decor like state plates and vintage ketchup and mustard containers. Nameless spinster would people-watch the room full of treehugging Madisonians and hipster college students with a curious yet confused eye. In the end she would be full from her subpar tofu scramble but seriously contemplating a second order of the peanut butter hot cocoa because it was the sexiest experience she'd had in a while."}
{"text":"Wonderful place to have a brunch. Very cosy and family friendly. Amazing options for a fulfilling meal. I love the atmosphere that makes me feel like at grannies'."}
{"text":"Excellent place for brunch or breakfast, very reasonable prices! The bus yourself thing can be a hassle if you don't hear your name called, but if you're upstairs they just yell louder!!!
The scones are pretty tasty, especially onced smothered with jam! I'd definitely recommend eating here to anyone looking for cheap meal and some unusual atmosphere."}
{"text":"I work a few blocks from Lazy Jane's.  I recently went for the first time and have since gone back twice, but only for lunch.  The first two visits I got their Cheeseburger which is very tasty.  It's cooked however you want and served with Lettuce, Tomato, Onion (grilled or raw) on Ciabatta.  It's served with kettle chips and a side salad for only $7.50.  I highly recommend it. 

The most recent visit, I actually ordered take out and got their Rueben, which I must say ranks pretty highly in my book as a quality rueben sandwich.

It's a nice little restaurant, with good food, a casual atmosphere, and reasonable prices.

I'll be visiting many more times in the future."}
{"text":"I loved LJ's when they first opened.  My friends and I went there several times a week.  But over the years, the prices have tripled (understandably), and the quality/quantity has gone WAY down.  Frankly, it's just not worth the wait any longer- unless you're there for a lemon scone.  Those are."}
{"text":"Great breakfast joint!  This has become mine and my husband's top breakfast joints on the weekend.  Be prepared to stand in line, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I have nothing new to say other than the fact that I LOVE this little cafe. They now accept credit cards so that is a huge plus! However, it never deterred me before. Their scones are the best I've ever had; it's an absolute must for first timers. Otherwise, they often have great specials so keep an eye out for those too. Their breakfast options are top notch as well as their lunch--my personal favorites are the waffles with berries and the turkey sandwich. I have never gotten anything I didn't like. Way to go!"}
{"text":"I love Lazy Jane's. I wish I had the resources to go there every other day. The staff is awesome. They are always super nice and accommodating. 

The food is fabulous. The waffles are my favorite. The potatoes are my favorite in Madison. And of course the scones are awesome. 

The only bad thing I can say about Lazy's is that the bacon has a weird consistency.

PEANUT BUTTER MOCHAS ARE FABULOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite bakery in Madison! The baked goods are perfection and they even have delicious coffee. A lot of times bakeries focus only on the food and have bad coffee and I love my coffee in the morning! Every baked good I have had here has been good but the morning buns are my favorite. If you go here you HAVE to try a morning bun!!"}
{"text":"I love, and always will love, Lazy Jane's. Their lemon scones have brought me back to Madison every year since moving to New Orleans and now Seattle. Delicious coffee and amazing other entries! They are always slammed, but it is 100% worth the wait."}
{"text":"We came for the scones, but ended up getting those to go and staying for a breakfast sandwich. The staff were very friendly, the inside is uniquely decorated, and service was fast (although it was a Tuesday morning). Overall a great place for a casual breakfast!"}
{"text":"We could have bumped our rating to a 4, but certain circumstances brought our rating down to a 3, which is too bad because the food is pretty good.  The lemon cream scone was incredible.  It isn't super dry like your typical scone and it is full of flavor.  Put some of the raspberry jam provided and you're set.  The BLTP (the \"p\" is for red bell pepper) was very tasty.  I like how they put it on rye, which adds some additional flavor.  Lots of bacon and surprisingly fresh lettuce (though it did keep falling out because they used the very small inside pieces of a head of romaine).  The red bell pepper was slightly roasted, but I think that it could have spent another minute or two in the broiler to maximize the flavor.  We also had the Works, with eggs, bacon, fried potatoes, and toast.  Again, good but not the best.

While the food deserves a 4 (although the lemonade had little flavor--not tart or sweet... just tasted like unripe lemon and water), everything else about our experience could have brought our rating down.  First of all, it is really inconvenient to go up to the counter and order, especially since the place is so small.  Also, although we saw the sign that said that breakfast on the weekends is served until 2, we didn't see the sign (if there was one) that said that ONLY breakfast was served on the weekend.  And lastly, although I thought the staff was sweet, the crowd was pretty snobbish.  We came with our kids, one of whom is 2 years  old and the other being 2 months old, and people seemed to give us the stink-eye when we had to tell our son to sit down or when our daughter cried for a few minutes (for this instance, we were in line ordering, and the place was so cramped we could hardly put her carrier down and soothe her until we sat down).

We'll come in again for some take out pastries or a quick snack, but this place is a bit overrated.  For a good breakfast/brunch we'll go to Cafe Soleil.  Or Crema Cafe.  Or Mermaid Cafe.  Or Manna Bakery.  Or Monty's."}
{"text":"A favorite for breakfast or brunch when friends or family are visiting.

They have *numerous* options for the vegetarian crowd, a fair number of vegan options, and their gluten-free lemon scones are still my favorite out there.

Super-friendly staff, homey atmosphere, and delicious food.

The only \"negatives\" I'd give them are that they're always *insanely* busy, and they're an option best when you're dining in a group of 4 or less, unless your party doesn't mind sitting at multiple tables."}
{"text":"Great scones and decent food.  I've never had anything besides the scones that are particularly memorable.  While I kind of like the call-out-your name system of food (it does have some charm), when \"joe schmoe\" doesn't show up for a while, it starts to lose its charm.  And the one cup refill on coffee (which is of course behind the counter) just seems a little stingy...it's okay lazy jane's, someone taking that extra cup or two won't run you out of business.  Tea is all bagged, unlike the loose offered at other superior breakfast locations in the city.  

Best bet for this joint: buy a scone or two and leave.  Repeat as desired."}
{"text":"FINALLY FINALLY, after SIX years of living in Madison I finally get a chance to eat here, without having to wait in the line that usually goes out the door and halfway down the block. Of course, we had to come super early, but it was worth it! The spicy mac n cheese pancakes are really as good as everyone says. I would definitely share with this plate though. One order fed 4 of us! But the real winner is the Loco Scramble...if you can, ask for extra guacamole. They make the most amazing guac........it's so good. Just soooo creamy, a bit of a spicy kick and packed full of flavor! The service was okay, it's more of a self-serve/clean place, which is fine by me! The only downside is that they only take cash...unless they have changed that by now."}
{"text":"Lazy Jane's is a cool, two-story house in Madison's hip Williamson Street area. It serves an eclectic crowd and offers American breakfast and lunch standards, from hash to veggie melts. When your order is ready the line cook theatrically yells out your name.

There aren't many vegan options, and they rarely have vegan baked goods, but what they do offer for vegans is pretty tasty.

I had the seitan hash ($6.50) which normally comes with eggs, but they left it off for me. Oddly enough, Lazy Jane's doesn't seem to offer a tofu scramble. How can you have seitan but not tofu?

The dish consists of a HUGE amount of skillet potatoes, roasted red peppers, mini pieces of broccoli, and chunks of seitan. The portion size was easily enough for two very filling meals.

I thought the flavors were great, and the toasted sourdough-rye bread on the side was fresh and delicious (Lazy Jane's has two vegan bread options which they helpfully pointed out to me). In general, I think the dish was good, and of much higher quality than similar brunch-style dishes you'd find at Monty's Blue Plate Diner down the road. That said, Monty's has many more vegan offerings than Lazy Jane's, so what you trade in quality you get back in variety.

I'd return to Lazy Jane's to try their limited vegan lunch options, but I just wish they'd expand their offerings to make them THE place to go for vegan brunch and lunch."}
{"text":"Yup, i'm keeping my ambiguous 3.5 star rating. 
I just don't go ecstatic about L-Jane's. 
Coffee is ok, the scones (and by now, I've tried most of the flavors), the atmosphere, and most importantly, the tofu scrambles are all - 'alright.'
There's nothing particularly wrong about their offerings, but none jumps out as the exception. I certainly don't wake up thinking about Lazy Jane's bk. 
I'll keep trying, and hopefully, they'll do the same, too."}
{"text":"Best breakfast and atmosphere in Madison. Hands down.

Always busy, yet still rockin' it. Keep up the amazing work.

Everything from their classic breakfasts to their waffles, spot on.

Refills on coffees is great. 

I could sit here all day."}
{"text":"Sconetastic. Sconerific. Sconemania. Ermegerd, the scones. Great Scott, have you tried the scones??? If you haven't, I feel so sorry for you that I might buy and personally deliver some. No one should live a life in Madison without sampling them at least once. If you lined up all the great things about Willy St. food, they would lead the parade.

If the scones aren't enough, or somehow aren't your thing, come anyway for the eclectic, grandma's house meets yard sale vibe. Even in a room full of strangers, you feel like you're at a sleepover at a best friend's house where their parents are slightly off kilter. Those were always the best parties. You kind of expect the adults to be playing euchre, drinking beer and smoking in another room somewhere, and laughing really loud.

But I digress. Try the BLT with roasted red pepper on sourdough, and ask to add avocado. Sometimes they'll have it, sometimes not, but it's really good either way. Walk out smiling and fulfilled."}
{"text":"Sunday morning visit in mid-July.  

Awesome scone, pretty good waffle, fabulous berry topping, superb seitan hash, absolutely disgusting iced coffee.  Off-putting cooler than thou attitude from staff, long but relatively fast-moving line.

This is probably all you need to know.

If I could send a minion to pick up baked goods/seitan hash here and coffee elsewhere, it would be the perfect arrangement."}
{"text":"We stopped in for baked goods on a weekday morning and the cafe was pleasantly occupied but not too full. There were a number of scone flavors available, and three scones out to try - raspberry, almond buttermilk, and something with coconut. We were informed that the first and last were sweeter. The raspberry was a bit too sweet for me, as there was a glaze on the scone. The almond buttermilk had pretty big chunks of almonds throughout. We actually decided to get a lemon cream scone. It had a nice texture and density, but was overall still a little too sweet due to the glaze, even with the tart lemon flavor. So, the scones to me seem like something great if you want a fair amount of sweetness in a big baked good.

We also tried the morning bun, which was enormous. It was flavored with cinnamon and sugar, without any citrus component, which I appreciated. The sugar did not become caramelized at the edges, which I also liked. We had a mexican wedding cookie which I thought was spot-on.

I'd be curious to try the croissants and maybe the actual meals offered. Overall I was quite impressed with the selection of baked goods and friendliness, but not pesteriness!, of the employees. A shame day old goods are only 50 cents off, but oh well."}
{"text":"LOVE the scones! Yum!"}
{"text":"I've never been a huge fan of breakfast foods or bacon (I know, the horror!), but Lazy Jane's has made me a true believer! Plus, I can't even begin to rave about how cute the cafe is. It is A-dorable. With a capital A. Giant scrabble tiles, anyone? 

I only paid $8.12 for my B.L.T.P. and a mug of coffee - nice! I opted out of the potato side, but for ya'll carbo-lovers, you can add potatoes to your sandwich for a few extra bucks. Although presentation is lacking, I guess that is of little importance when your main focus is on the freshness of the food. In that category, Lazy Jane's definitely cannot be beat! (The bacon was still sizzling when I went to retrieve my sandwich from the window. Tttssssss!)

Lazy Jane's, you have truly won my heart. I can't wait to be back to try more of the menu. :9"}
{"text":"Scones, scones, scones. Fav flavors: Maple nut and Coffee chip. Cranberry orange is pretty darn good too. Another one of the great restaurants in Madison and the hippie joint of Willy Street.
It's located in a creaky old town house. You walk in and order cafeteria style in a line by the door. 
The seating upstairs is awesome because it has more space, a sofa, and tons of children books. It reminds me of the coffee shops in Scotland where they're in rusty old homes adding an ambiance which is impossible for new buildings."}
{"text":"This place is exceptionally cute, a little house that you order as you walk in, tell them your name, find a seat, either downstairs or up in the \"attic\" and they scream it out  when the food is done....I guess, hence the \"lazy\"

First off - Best scone I've ever had, strawberry and peach with a lemon frosting glaze.

We were there on Sunday so we could only order brunch, but the selection just wasn't impressive or interesting or really make sense.
I had a salmon, cream cheese scramble, that was...ok.  but it was literally all this stuff mashed up and thrown on a plate for $6 or something, maybe more. 

My husband got the seitan scramble or something, that came with half a plate of eggs.  Kind of strange...it seems it seitan you'd have some kind of vegan option .. 

I don't know, again, it's really cute, and from what my cousins say - Madison lacks in the brunch department...it could be so much more interesting and eclectic, like to go with the space more.

The woman at the counter was adorable and SO friendly, but the yelling out of the names when you are upstairs is just too much...
for the 15 minutes we waited, all us at the table sat in disturbing awkward silence trying to decipher the yells coming from below.

I'd try it again for lunch or for a scone!"}
{"text":"Visited while on business based on reviews here. Everything that has been said previously is true...charming decor, great food (cherry scone delicious), and a cozy, local-inhabited joint.
Only 3 stars because there was no wi-fi. Maybe it's just me, but I expect to have wi-fi in coffee shops everywhere. Some people might find the lack of wi-fi quaint but it is the reason I won't be back unless I stop in for a to-go order."}
{"text":"Scones and scramblers are delicious. The variety is large get there early for the scones before they disappear. Friendly staff, seating and parking can tough because it gets busy in the morning ."}
{"text":"COOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOREEEEEEEEEEEEEY! That's pretty much what happens when you line up at Lazy Jane's, order some grub, grab a seat and wait for your name to be called... if you're name is Corey. It's loud and I love it. 

You know what else I also love? Blueberry scones. And blackberry scones. And pumpkin chocolate chip scones. Really I just love scones. And for a few weeks now I've been foraging for the finest, until I read some recs that lead me to believe LJ's is where it's at. And it is. They're delicate, moist, sweet but not overly so, and warped up in the micro makes it seems as though they just came outta the oven.

Add to this the fact that their other breakfast offerings are extremely reasonable for the amount of food, and you have a mighty morning stop. Bring cash though, because VISA isn't every you want to be, and the day I was there some eager eaters had trouble with the indoor ATM."}
{"text":"WOW. I can't believe it took me so long to try out Lazy Jane's - this place is truly a gem! With it's lime green exterior, it certainly catches your eye on Willy Street but the fact that it's built just like a house makes it easy to walk by without considering it as a restaurant. It is a casual restaurant with a relaxed, welcoming ambiance and self-serve style service. This was my second time trying to go there - be wary of their hours, as they close at 2PM! 

If you love scones, this is 100% the place to go. I've never seen any bakery in Madison that has so many kinds of scones - in fact, it's almost a little overwhelming because you'll want to order all of them and have to enact some self-restraint (THE BEST KIND OF SELF-RESTRAINT). 
- Pro tip: Go with multiple friends, order multiple scones, share them! :) They are also quite large and scones are dense in general so you can save some extra room for food!

I ordered the lemon cream scone (YUM), italian sausage omelette, and a coffee. 
- Scone: Incredible. Perfect ratio of scone to icing, the right amount of crumble in a scone, and a lovely level of sweetness. 10/10
- Italian Sausage Scramble: Comes with your choice of toast (would HIGHLY recommend wheatberry, it's a much thicker cut than regular bread and they already put butter on it for you so you don't need to feel guilty about slathering it on later), breakfast potatoes, and the scramble. This is a good amount of food overall. The scramble was one of the best I've had in Madison as well - the eggs were light, and the food didn't feel heavy or greasy like a lot of American breakfasts do. The potatoes were average, but that may have been asking too much from a solidly good dish overall. Awesome job, Lazy Jane's! 9/10

The workers are extremely friendly, the service is surprisingly fast, and there is easily accessible street parking available nearby. There is a lot of interesting art inside and this would be a place that I would feel comfortable even going to by myself and just enjoying a nice morning. Definitely stop on by if you are in the Willy Street area!"}
{"text":"Best scones I've ever eaten.......they alone would warrant 5 stars.  Breakfast doesn't quite match up to the scones, but it's pretty good and consistent.  The scrambles (sundried tomato and bacon is my favorite) are always cooked slightly runny, which I prefer.  Portions aren't huge, but with the breakfast potatoes and choice of bread, it's adequate.  One of the nicest things about dining here is that I never feel bloated and overly greased-out.  

The place does get awfully crowded and hot, so plan your visit accordingly.  Also Lazy Jane's only accepts cash and check (ATM inside), which is kind of annoying when you want to purchase extra scones to take home or to friends!!!!!!  I understand the establishment doesn't want to pay the bank fees with credit cards and such, but it's 2012 and we're not in Chinatown or dealing with contraband!  

Definitely go for the scones, though!  They also serve them at Aldo Cafe at the Wisconsin Institute for Discovery!"}
{"text":"This is the place that made me regret my decision to live on the west side. The space is super cute and cozy, the service friendly, the coffee delicious and the scone selection unparalleled. Though I can't say they are the best scones I've ever had (the flavors are beautiful and delicate but the texture isn't quite tender enough), they are definitely the best in town."}
{"text":"Lazy Jane's is a small restaurant located in a converted 2 story house. The old-fashioned furniture and abundance of knicknacks gives the distinct impression that you're eating at somebody's grandmother's house.

I've heard this place is raved about for it's breakfasts, but we went there for lunch. They had a fairly wide selection of items to choose from, all written in brightly colored chalk on blackboards behind the counter. I ordered a chai latte, strawberry scone and a cheeseburger, while my wife ordered a reuben and jasmine tea. 

We were both impressed by the scone. I expect scones to be dry and hard, but this was soft, moist, almost fluffy -- it reminded me less of what I expect of a scone and more what I'd expect from a funny-shaped muffin.

My cheeseburger was fine, if a little heavy on the lettuce for my tastes. The chai was likewise satisfactory. Niether really stood out from the crowd, but nor do I have any real complaints.

My wife not only enjoyed her tea, but stated that the reuben was the best she'd ever had.

Overall, it was decent food at a decent price in a pleasant atmosphere, so we'll probably go back."}
{"text":"What's wrong with you people?  If you can't find anything wrong, give it a better rating.  \"We loved it\" and no complaints = 5, not 4.

Lazy Jane's is one of the places I desperately miss from Madison.  I started going there when I was taking 6 AM martial arts classes nearby and was delighted to discover it on the way to work.  The eggs are, without doubt, the best in the city.  The potatos are sadly flavorless, and I'm irritated they don't give refills on milk, but other than that no complaints.  Prices are decent, being neither high nor low for the quality of food.  While the lines can be long, they move quickly and are worth the wait."}
{"text":"Went to Lazy Jane's for brunch this morning (around 1pm). 

Get there as early as you can! They ran out of a number of dishes and the scone selection was sparse. Also, they needed to restock the water glasses, and they ran out of forks, apparently due to a dishwasher malfunction. Eating the seitan hash with plastic cutlery is a little challenging =) 

BUT The food and atmosphere are still amazing. And I had the vanilla almond coffee. OMG! Yum!"}
{"text":"Oh, Lazy Jane's! You are a Madison institution.

Here are the things I love about you:
-The decor make you feel like you are eating in your grandmother's living room, a ski lodge, and an art gallery all at once. 
-I like playing Scrabble while eating your delicious food.
-I enjoy the camaraderie you feel in line while waiting to order. 
-I think it is adorable that your \"OPEN\" sign switches to \"NOPE\" when you are closed.
-The food is excellent, and the lack of brunch cocktails encourages me to not waste my weekends day-drinking, which I am prone to.

Here are things that I dislike, but will accept as part of life:
-The long lines every day. I like you a lot, but sometimes I need hangover food immediately and opt to go to a way worse place across the street.
-Cash only always throws me off. I wish you would accept my plastic or at least my good intentions as currency. 
-The gluten-free toast you have is kinda gross. I used to upgrade to it out of principle, but now I just give my toast to whoever I am eating with."}

Waking up early for a morning run around Madison it was after nearly ten miles followed by a quick shower that I made my way to kitschy and cozy Lazy Jane's Café and although I unfortunately forgot to return to the second-hand store next door before departing town my sixty minute stay at the restaurant itself was definitely a delight, the charming décor only bested by fresh baked goods and service with a smile.  Perhaps a bit \"off the beaten path\" and almost entirely populated by locals with counter service and self seating both upstairs and down it was to a wide variety of sandwiches, eggs, and entrees that I was tempted on arrival but focusing largely on pastry my six-part order was crafted, the first five items from the cooling racks while a daily special of blueberry studded flapjacks was readied on the griddle.  Obviously prone to overindulgence in a place with four options of coffee with limitless refills for just $1.75 it was in one cup of each that I entrusted my thirst and with both flavored options proving quite subtle I was impressed by them all, the light roast pairing best with an opening volley of three scones from which only the overly rich s'mores would prove less than textbook in texture, though flavors were all spot-on.  Underwhelmed by a croissant that was unfortunately lacking in lamination but finding reprieve in a morning bun rife with cinnamon and sugar it was finally after thirty minutes that my name was called from the kitchen and procuring my pancakes from the window before slathering them with pure maple syrup I was soon quite glad I'd only eaten half of each pastry, the bursting berries amidst fluffy buttermilk batter proving irresistible with each subsequent bite."}
{"text":"Ohmystars. I love the scones. I havent the faintest if anything else is good, but the scones are delicious. There is a serious Saturday morning rush, so be prepared to wait in line. The coffee could've been a bit stronger, but that's just personal preference. Cant wait to come back!"}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast place in Madison! I always bring out-of-town guests here for a true taste of Madison.

Their scones are crazy good. I am a big fan of the lemon cream ones, but I have never been disappointed by a Lazy Jane's scone.

Their breakfast choices are all great. I usually go with a traditional eggs, bacon, and breakfast potatoes, but the scrambles and waffles are really good too!

It gets pretty busy on weekend mornings. Be prepared to wait in line if you go between 9am and noon!

And remember, it's cash only. I always forget..."}
{"text":"Other posts have mentioned this, and they aren't lying:  the SCONES are worth the trip alone.  I ordered the Lemon Cream scone, as well as the Chorizo Scramble.  On reflection, I wish I had purchased a flight of scones.  They all looked decadent!

Great ambience -- shabby chic furniture and eclectic art on the walls.  Mismatched plates and mugs.

I went with a group of 6, and we all gave it 2 thumbs up!

But seriously:  buy a scone."}
{"text":"One of my fav breakfast spots! The price is right. Everything I've had is good. Notables are their pancakes, and chorizo egg scramble. Great coffee too. Employees are super fun and nice. One of the better environments out of the Mad town cafés. The cooks have a lot of fun. A visit here isn't complete without hearing your name yelled out a la Rocky yelling out for Adrienne."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful!  I'm not sure who Lazy Jane is but she is most certainly not the hard working baker of the gorgeous scones and pastries!  With a wonderful neighborhood and community feel, this cozy place really impressed me.  Although I was trying to be good today and just had a coffee, I can't wait to go back for a raspberry scone and peanut butter hot chocolate."}
{"text":"I heard great things about this place but boy do I not know my way around Madison! I was able to find this charming quaint breakfast place though. There is a parking lot but can be hard depending on the time of day. I shot over when it opened and found parking and a seat.

This is a CASH ONLY place. They have a ATM and I was glad to see the fee was NOT $6 but rather a mere $1 and change.

I found the waffle with pecans and banana intriguing and ordered it. I wasn't disappointed and even inspired a few to have a similar breakfast that morning. I picked up a variety of their scones to go. I don't have any complaints about them even when I dug into one of them 2 days later! 

They do have a penguin on a stick in the back..... Fake of course. I think it might be for their garden. Unless I'm mistaken and it's not their garden at all!"}
{"text":"Lazy Jane's is my fav brunch spot in Madison, and I swear I have been to them all. I always get a scone and try to get one of their specials. Pancakes are great, all of their scrambles are great, waffles are great, the tofu hash is great, potatoes are great - IT iS ALL GREAT. 

I luv u Lazy Jane's."}
{"text":"SCONES!

A variety of scones are offered daily; favorites include the lemon cream and the berry flavors.  Plus, day old scones are only $1 each (they are still good, BTW).

Vegan options include tofu scramblers and seitan hash.  About 5 daily specials are offered, so keep an eye on the chalkboard near the register.  My favorite entree is usually a scrambler from the specials board and a scone.  Espresso beverages and several different coffees of the day are available as well.  

As for decor, it's very Willy Street-ish and casual.  As a renovated older home, seating upstairs and downstairs is a charmingly motley collection of couches and old wooden chairs.  You can usually find a few board games on the upper floor and some oddities like old magazines and kids' books.

Overall a pleasant place for casual breakfast and brunch, no fuss."}
{"text":"The scones here are AMAZING! Eating a blueberry scone as I write this and I love it so much. Tip: all of the fruit scones use the lemon batter as a base, so that makes them all the better! Blueberry becomes blueberry lemon and man it is GOOD!"}
{"text":"Wonderful establishment. I imagine seats are hard to come by on weekends, but during the week this place is very comfortable."}
{"text":"Very interesting fresh homemade Scones.

Large breakfast portions. 

I had the Carnitas Spinich Omelette very good with baby red potatoes."}
{"text":"I like the different way it is set and what makes it unique, but somehow fighting for table, and the yelling of our name for kitchen uhh ,also limited  choices and cash only"}
{"text":"We heard about the lovely scones that they make. Heads up they don't take plastic. Cash only. We didn't know that and we placed our order and we were about to pay then we found out no plastic. So we looked in the wallet and the car for cash. We were still short to pay. The owner walked by and said its no problem. That was wonderful of her. It was well worthy the embarrassment. The bakery there is wonderful. We came back and we placed our order and we made sure to have extra cash on hand so we can pay back the owner. This is place is small cozy wonderful place."}
{"text":"We happened upon this place unexpectedly while searching for a place to grab Easter brunch. We weren't looking for a big buffet or fancy meal, so we were happy to find out that Lazy Jane's was open.

First thing I loved: it has a very homey atmosphere and is in an old house. Although I've heard it's hard to get a table during peak times, there is a lot of seating and even an upstairs dining room.

As far as food options, they are endless. I was thrilled to grab a seitan scramble. You get to pick from a variety of bread (seriously, there's 7 or so options available each day) for your side, which is another added bonus. Veggie options, fresh bakery items, and friendly service made the ordering step a piece of cake. Disclaimer: I did not see cake as one of the fresh bakery items.

Once we sat down and indulged on our breakfast, it was amazing. We all loved our food, although it wasn't fancy. My scrambled and potatoes was a bit above the level of greasy diner food, but really tasty overall.

I wish they would be open for more than just breakfast and lunch, but they sure do a good job on those meals. I'll be back very soon!"}
{"text":"I came in here, not expecting to find a seat, but was pleasantly surprised. Even with a line out the door (11am, Sunday), by the time we got past the cash register, the two of us actually had seating options to choose from.

The food was great, my mocha was tasty and visually attractive, and the atmosphere was comfortable. I was also surprised that, even in such tight quarters, the sound level was conducive to a comfortable discussion volume.

I will most certainly be coming back to explore the menu further.

Also, I'm not sure why folks listed it as not being wheelchair accessible. When in fact, it is. (the votes have swayed and now the data given above is accurate)"}
{"text":"Super super cute place! It's a home that's been converted to a restaurant. Food is absolutely delicious and homemade. I felt at home coming in here. Great place."}
{"text":"Holy cow was this place good. We were looking for good places to eat during our Madison visit and found this one on Yelp. It is everything mentioned by others and more. I will never pass up a chance to have biskets and gravy if they look promising and when I saw they were on the specials board there was no need to look any further for my breakfast choice. Homemade biskets with cheese and chives, smothered in the most fantastic gravy ever. All the others in our party were equally pleased with their choices as well. Another standout choise was the pancakes with peaches and blueberries. Nothing else was needed on them, they were perfect as served."}
{"text":"Wow!  The reviews I heard and read about this Cafe were great, so I decided to give it a try.

Located on the East Side of Madison it was right on my way to the Freeway back to Milwaukee after going to the Madison Farmer's Market.

This place is a bit of a time warp, and I loved in.  Large painted wooden letters with the bakery's name took be back in time, like way back in time.

But the moment I walked in the door and saw the large glass bakery case I KNOW you made a good decision to come here.  The scones, the croissants and the biscuits are all fresh, large and enticing.  And yes, they do taste as good as they look!

I had a bacon and cheddar scones that was divine!   The small flecks of local bacon and the shreds of Wisconsin aged cheddar were in perfect proportion to the well seasoned and perfectly baked scone.

While I was waiting for my scone to be heated I checked out the kitchen.   The concept here is casual awesome.  Order and pay at the register and get your beverage and bakery at the counter.   If you order entrees there's an open window to the kitchen and you wait for yours to come up and serve yourself.

I watched pretty awesome plate sized Belgian waffles, light and fluffy omelets and  stacks of golden pancakes come out of that window.  

It really made me wish that I had the time for a full breakfast, and I will make sure that I do next time.

Because based upon my experience here there will certainly be a next time!"}
{"text":"Scones to die for!  Breakfast is delicious and sets you up wonderfully for the rest of the day.  Only issue I have is parking.  The lot is too small and you have to park in the street, if you can find a spot close."}
{"text":"I made it my mission to try all the brunch spots. Every weekend it was another cafe. Algorithm was running smoothly. But then I tried Lazy Jane's. After that the process just became an every other weekend routine, with the other weekend returning to Jane's. At this point it's almost always Jane's. The process is ended and I'm not even mad. The specials and the scones are always great (hit that raspberry scone with the lemon cream dough, hit that shit).

Protip: if you're not in the mood for the potatoes or toast, you can exchange the side. Just ask! Everybody's super nice.

Cash only!

Favorite place in Madison over every category."}
{"text":"Good portions, very friendly, pastries were amazing. in a very unique part of Madison."}
{"text":"The seitan hash and eggs will make you question your carnivorous habits.  Tasty scones for the road as well.  Good luck getting a table before Jerry yells out your name with your order up."}
{"text":"This place has been long due on my checklist. One of the cozy places in Madison. Lot of varieties to choose from for breakfast and desserts. I didn't expect they would have a parking lot but there weren't any spots available so no worries, we still found one right on the street.

Things we ordered:
Scones: Blueberry (3.5) and the double chocolate chip with almonds (5). The scones were really tasty but they were too big for us to finish but we still enjoyed them.
Setian Hash - 4. I got it with the sour dough toast and it tasted really great but I didn't feel it was extraordinary.
Tofu Scrambler - 3.5 by the husband. He expected it to be something else but it turned out something else. I liked it though. The spices and the potatoes were tasty!
Service - as good as most places in Madison. Friendly and patient.
Price - Right for the quantity.

Overall, we will definitely visit again to try the other items on the menu. :)

Oh... And I almost forgot... They have a sort of antique store right next door. Be sure to go there. They had a lot of cute and fun home decor items..."}
{"text":"When I think of Lazy Janes I think of a sunny Saturday morning following a visit to the farmers market!  While yes great in the winter too...I just love the cozy homey feel of this place.  It can be packed on the weekend so you need to bring your patience, but if you come with good friends the wait is part of the fun!  Baked goods are obviously amazing...their scones are some of the best I've ever had (get the raspberry if it's available) and their morning buns are phenomenal.  Their food is always good and looks like your mom was in the kitchen cooking for you...nothing overly fancy but well done and delish.  I do miss that they don't yell your name out anymore from the kitchen when your order is up...that was part of the quirky charm to me, instead you now get a pager.  All in all a great staple for fun breakfast in Madison!"}
{"text":"Good lunch spot, amazing breakfast.

 Lunch sandwiches come with chips and greens making it a pretty good buy at $8-9 per plate. Daily specials are notable for good variety and use of quality meat. My roommate is a big fan of the scones."}
{"text":"Solid, funky place. I stop there for breakfast once a week becuase it's delicious. The menu is fresh, the food is well portioned, not boring and flavorful. It's in an old house, which is cool, but the tables are tiny. I've not had a bad meal in six months, so what does that tell ya? the other reviewers have pointed out their strengths - their hash is fantastic, the baked goods are a must. I bring them home to Chicago each time I go. Visit this place and support them.
neg - the cash only thing is a bit backward, i know it saves them money and I dont care, but i've seen many people in put in awkward positions becuase of it. I think its time to step up LJ and join the future and dump the cash machine - u could fit another table in the place....."}
