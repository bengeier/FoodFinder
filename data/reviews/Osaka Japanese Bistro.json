{"text":"Still the spot for late night sushi!  The ambiance is nice and its rarely crowded. The servers are attentive and the food is good. Their specialty rolls are better than their standard rolls. Once again I don't go their for the fresh rolls, not many great options in that category. However its still the 1st place we head after 11pm when the craving hits."}
{"text":"This place is great for a late night sushi craving since they stay open until 2am. Its got traditional Japanese seating,  restaurant, sushi bar or Teppanyaki. You have lots of choices on how to dine. The sushi is good but the choices could be better. I prefer fresh sushi rolls and I think their fresh rolls lack creativity. They have a good selection of tempura and deep fried rolls. The prices are a little much for what they offer and the 1/2 rolls menu is not much of a deal in my opinion. Its a cool place but not my favorite."}
{"text":"The best Japanese in Las Vegas!!!  I have been to a lot of Japanese places in LA and Vegas and food, drinks, decor, service as well as unique sushi is awesome!!"}
{"text":"I recommend this to anyone visiting or living in Vegas.  The dishes are great and happy hour keeps you coming back for more and if you are lucky, you might get to hear some Jazz!"}
{"text":"This was my favorite restaurant in 1999. The Japanese Sushi chefs were engaging, talented and very hospitable. In a dearth of culture and social connection, these guys made me feel like a king. Twelve years later? It was comforting to see the same art and decor. But when I entered and was ignored and left without a sign telling me to wait or move forward to one of the other rooms, it was uncomfortable. Three chefs ignored me, the waitress walked by and looked at me, no acknowledgement, and continued serving others. What happened to this place? You have a Las Vegas icon, once upon a time it was Caesars or Osaka, now everyone loves Sushi (thank you everyone, I can get plenty of good sushi everywhere, thanks to you) and Osaka is not worth passing the next Sushi place to get to. It's expense account expensive with average service and average food. The ankimo was fishy, the chu-toro was stringy and no better than the hamachi (wouldn't it be better to say you were out rather than dress up a fatty hamachi or blue-fin?). One saving grace, in a world of competitive all you can eaters downing monster portions of nigiri and sashimi, the portions of nigiri were small and mouth sized, beautiful. Sushi is a delicate food served with style and grace, thank you for the small portions. But then the cut roll menu looks like Denny's with the \"me-too\" monster portions and americanized flavor. Help!"}
{"text":"Dang it. I really wanted to love this place.  But the truth is, the atmosphere was reeeally dark. Not in a cozy, intimate way, but dark and depressing.  Our food was just so-so.  We ordered soup, salad, two types of sushi, edamame, white rice, and okonomiyaki.  Unfortunately, the food lacked fresh ingredients and was mostly very bland.  Our server, Haru-tan (?), an ex-pat from Japan was WONDERFUL and friendly.  But sadly, we would not return to this place.  Phooey."}
{"text":"good rolls, and cool sushi chefs.  With the chilled jazz ambience, its easy to have a nice late night dinner.    However, the veggie-only(non-fish based) rolls are more expensive than the fish-based rolls, kind of counter-intuitive IMO.  Other than that, some nice age dashi tofu, and a salad with a rolls makes for an easy & tasty meal."}
{"text":"We went here because it was a Diners Drive-ins and Dives recommendation!  We were happy to say that Guy was right on!  I'm not a fan of seafood but this place did not smell of seafood and we sat in the same room as the sushi bar!  My husband and daughter had sushi and soup and I had chicken and all three dishes were delicious.  The servers were very attentive and the experience was a good one.  Will visit again the next time we go to Vegas!"}
{"text":"After researching for about an hour my husband finds Osaka. After going over the menu we read some reviews, and found that some people didn't really like it and others absolutely loved. Well so did we! Yes the outward appearance of this hidden gem may ward off some but that's what I love about it extremely low pro. inside you find a small but well appointed and well decorated place. The food was great we ordered the Osaka rice kamikaze roll octopus fritters sashimi BBQ short ribs spicy edamame king crab tempura Salmon Kama. Our waiter Alex was a huge help with ordering since you see we ordered a lot for the two of us. As well as killed  the Sake sampler with the apple raspberry and lychee flavors and a whole bottle of the Lychee Sake (as you can see that one was our favorite. Late night menu ROCKS! Wish I could have ate more! Definitely going to become one these newcomers favorite hang out."}
{"text":"The sushi is fine but I can't even go out to eat without some liberal at the next table hooking me into her brand of politics. Now. I don't mind idle friendly chit chat with fellow diners but I keep it on the weather. She seemed intent on verbally haranguing and Harassing me. For 20 minutes she relentlessly yammered on and on about liberal politics and female white privilege. This woman was belligerent and looking for an argumentI couldn't even look at the menu as her voice was too loud to concentrate over. She's not the type that will allow you to ignore her. So much for being nice and it's my bad for even making eye contact with a lone diner. I feel like an idiot even giving people the time of day."}
{"text":"Walked into this restaurant the other night and, oh boy, they do they bring traditional seating back into style. Their luxurioius seating in the back that will make you take your shoes off to seat at a traditional japanese style seating tables brings you a bit of japanese tradition into your experience there. They have some of the best sushi rolls ive eaten so far in vegas. Will visit again soon. Great customer service."}
{"text":"Don't buy the groupon to enjoy at this restaurant! I reservation with mention using the coupon at 8:00 pm. When i get in at 8 pm, the lady which I believe is the owner of this restaurant said I have to wait 40 more minutes to seat at the cooked table or just choose a regular to seat. After 10 minutes waiting, the new walking group came, that lady told me again may be over 1 more hours and yell on my face that she didn't trick me. Too disappointing, i went out. I will never come back to this restaurant again ^.^"}
{"text":"Visited this place last month with my parents and a couple of friends and had the worst service ever!  The gal who waited on us was young, in her 20's and doesn't have any common sense.  I asked her three times to give me the bill and also asked the other male waiter twice as well.  What does she do?  Let my friend pay for it.  And I know that I had asked her first.  I realize that she may have been put in an awkward situation when my friend gave her her credit card but she could have politely said that someone had already asked for the bill and not taken her card.  That would have been the common sense or right thing to do.  Needless to say, I was upset with how she handled the situation.  The food is okay, I've had better, but for me the whole incident with the bill leaves a sour taste.  I will not go back again!"}
{"text":"Two words, \"Great Service!!\" I'm someone who likes to try new things whenever I have the chance. Although sushi isn't necessarily new for me, the experience I had at Osaka Japanese Bistro on Eastern ave. was definitely a refreshing experience! Before dining in at Osaka, I already had a favorite sushi spot that I would take friends and acquaintances but my first visit here changed that. I walked in to a very warm greeting and very promptly asked by Lina where I would like to sit, I decided the sushi bar. I didnt know what to order so she made a couple of suggestions and served our beverages in a timely matter. I told her that I'm a sweet roll/salmon and sake lover so she suggested the \"Oh Kamisama paired with a cold blueberry sake\" AMAZINGLY GOOD!! We all agreed this to be one of the best experiences at a sushi bar. To put it simply...Comfortable environment, delicious sushi, amazing sushi chef (ARMANDO), and service was 5 star at its finest.(LINA) THANKS GUYS!!!"}
{"text":"The best sushi I have had in a while. From the service to the food was a great experience!"}
{"text":"Welllll, I have tell you-10 years ago loved coming here. I just find it generic. The menu is out of control. Do not bring non foodies with- they will loose their mind...as I did with the boring sashimi.  Everyone else had sukiyaki and complained about how amazing tempura is/was...yeah, this place is bunk. Best o luck...going to momo!!! Hhhhhhhhway!"}
{"text":"Amazing food I've been going here for the last 4 years and still they just get better and better. The sushi is amazing and always fresh and the sushi chefs are amazing friendly and always energetic( if u do go to the sushi bar ask for john and don't be shy he's one of the bests."}
{"text":"This is our go to place for sushi.  Off strip, reasonable prices, good selection of sake.  They do a lot of other japanese food options that are good also.  Just make sure to go to Sahara.  The location on Eastern was not nearly as good."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I have been going there for years and never had a bad experience. The staff is always very welcoming and friendly, and the food is never a disappointment. I would recommend this place for sure!"}
{"text":"Sorry guys, I would never come back again!!! The price isn't worth the quality of food. Service gets worse than before I came here.N needlessly the food is beyond the average price among Japanese sushi restaurants'. I don't really like to give a bad review, but as a regular customer at  \"Osaka \", I've already lost any confidence with it. Sorry, I am disappointed that you guys cannot make sure the food we eat is always good n definitely deserve the price of food that I pay for."}
{"text":"Stopped in for teppan after a 6 year hiatus. Someone mentioned renovations in their review...what renovations?  Arrived at 5:30pm. The place was empty. Staff were all friendly & attentive. Our chef was okay, which in turn left our meal \"okay.\"  Nothing seemed to be seasoned properly. I have had better teppan experiences & food here. I will be back tho. The service is excellent. The food usually is as well. When we left at 7pm the sushi bar was packed.   A few things about guest safety...  Carpet edges rolled back, mats by teppan room & sushi bar haphazardly thrown about. As someone who just had foot surgery I easily could have tripped & fallen, reinjuring my foot or sustaining a new one.   The teppan tables are built with bricks offset & randomly sticking out on the base. I struck my knee twice on this & woke up this morning with two nasty bruises on my knee. Not happy.   Watch your step & watch your knees is my advice."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants! The service is great and I love the atmosphere, there's art hanging on the walls and jazz playing in the background. Last time I went there, I ordered the Titanic, which is a variety of sashimi and rolls. The fish was amazingly fresh and all of the rolls were handcrafted! It was something that I definitely recommend, if you are in a large group."}
{"text":"I visit this place often & I must say last night I was extremely disappointed & embarrassed! I had family in town who wanted an awesome sushi place to try in Vegas! Sushi Samba would have been a go but the time didn't agree lol. So we went to Osaka... When we entered an requested a tapa table we were told the section was now closed... Ok understandable no problem...literally less than 5 minutes, seriously not even 5 mins. 5 other people walk in a request a tapa and was seated with slight hesitation... When I brought it to the servers attention he didn't have an answer... I must say I was completely most utterly disgusted. I will never patronize this business again! This was the most extreme but the service is truly on & off... I've had one guy a few time that was quite pleasant! But this... Sorry excuse for service..."}
{"text":"By far the best Japanese restaurant in town! All of the food is top notch and delicious.   We have been coming here for over 12 years and I have to say the service is great! We are always greeted at the door and always feel welcome when we go here. Staff is very polite and are always there to help and the wait time is fast but not too fast.  They have the best meso soup in town, I have try the other japanese food places, and I have to say this is the best!  I would recommend the firecracker shrimp which is so good! The chicken and beef teriyaki is always great with generous proportions.  The sushumi is superb! Tastes so good everytime I go here.  For dessert I recommend the deep fried ice cream! Will always continue to go here as long as I live here in Vegas."}
{"text":"Nice Hibachi style and sushi restaurant. Food tasted great and the table chef was very entertaining. Price was OK and the place was full on a weekday. Lots of birthdays that evening. Atmosphere not that great and the neighborhood is changing."}
{"text":"Love this place! Friendly staff and great food. I've never had a bad meal here. The Virgin Roll is my absolute favorite! We also love the live music!"}
{"text":"Service was friendly, setting was unique, and the food was good. My husband and I got the Titanic boat to share and try a variety of things. The sushi was good but not the best we have had."}
{"text":"My Husband is a chef, he has given me many pearls of wisdom when it comes to choosing a restaurant; for example is the parking lot full? Osaka's is always overflowing!! Do the locals dine there? Locals have been dining here since the 60's. Las Vegas is a young city, so right away that is telling. This restaurant is a Mecca for the cognoscenti (peeps in the know) which includes lifelong residents and the born and raised Las Vegans. They know where the good eats are in this city and Osaka has the goods!! One thing I love is the privacy of the seating which only accentuates the incredible dishes. The service is wonderful! Exceptional wait staff and bus people, not only do they take care of your every need but they are all beautiful to boot!! (Not that that is a prerequisite) but it doesn't hurt. I would encourage everyone, whether you live here or just visiting our unique city, to visit Osaka's Japanese Bistro for a gastronomical delight! Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"I come to osaka often now, lately at least once a month, so I feel I need to upgrade them to a 4.5-5. Their service and food is pretty consistent, but the reason I'm upgrading their score is because of the servers. They are always very courteous and come by to refill drinks at least twice each time i visit. They even have tolerance for the lurkers... you know, those people who stay at the restaurant way past the time necessary after eating there. (I, unfortunately, know this from personal experience... thank you for not kicking us out!). So a shout out to the workers at osaka!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for great quality sushi, Osaka is the place to go. I have been coming to this specific location for 7 years now and this place will always be my favorite for the best quality sushi. I recommend trying this place out whether you enjoy raw fish or not...The service is wonderful and the staff is always friendly. Osaka has never let me down. The only problem i see personally is that it is not that spacious and the sushi bar is a bit crowded. Other than needing to expand their restaurant, everything is pretty amazing. Sushi love!!"}
{"text":"I love the feel of this place. Yeah, it's older but it's a familiar Las Vegas older I grew up with in the 90s. It's got a local Las Vegas feel mixed with Japanese atmosphere. I like that it's not brand new or remodeled away it's soul.  The food is made with love. You can really feel the coolness when you eat the food. And the people who run the place are so nice."}
{"text":"A FAVORITE of my wife and I! Delicious menu with the best sushi I have sampled in a while. This joint is very authentic in looks and has a nice menu to select from. Osaka comes with Teppan grill and great Tatami rooms in which you enter and the ambiance takes over from there. Servers and staff are genuine and very attentive and price range is very fair. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The only thing that saves this place was their food.  Honestly CUSTOMER Service was horrible.Just went in to around 10pm and seemed steady. I sat down and ordered chicken katsu  and fried rice. After 30 min of waiting I asked where my food was and they said it was coming. Some people sat next to me and ordered their food, and 10 min later some fried rice came, but not for me. It was for the other table. Then another fried rice came for another table. I finally get my food 50 min later, no fried rice only katsu. I asked for my fried rice and she said it was coming. The table of 3, who just sat down next to me gets their 6 orders of fried rice. It's like they said no fried rice for that guy. He doesn't deserve it. To top it all off I had iced tea. I told the first server who tried to pour water in my drink that, and saved my drink. Next server comes and doesn't hesitate, he just pours water in my cup.. I mean come on I had tea on the bottom."}
{"text":"I have had consistently great service every time I come here. I haven't had anything I didn't like, and the sake selection is pretty impressive. The first time I went here, I was reassured to see a large table full of Japanese people, speaking Japanese. Does it get more reassuring than that?"}
{"text":"After a few failed attempts at other sushi restaurants ended up here as a last resort... I'm glad we came here food is amazing, fresh and delicious. Great customer service!"}
{"text":"Staff seemed bored and rude....tasteless sushi...dirty.....worthless"}
{"text":"Went here the other day for lunch, and it was amazing !  My mother and I are Japanese, and have been looking everywhere for a GOOD real Japanese place to eat and we finally found it at Osaka.  The staff is very friendly and they also spoke Japanese as well which was a plus, we were able to order food speaking our native tongue.   We ordered some sushi and the fish tasted nice and fresh. They also make a delicious cucumber salad.  They have a good selection of desserts as well, I was surprised to see red bean ice cream on the list it is one of my faves!  The mother ordered green tea tiramisu which was also very delicious!   Gotta say I am picky when it comes to eating \" Japanese\" food in America but Osaka was great, with good prices as well ! I would recommend it to everyone!   Cant wait to go back and try eating at the Teppan syle."}
{"text":"I have to admit that I really like Japanese food, and there is quite a few excellent restaurants in Las Vegas. This is the one I go to if I want Teppanyaki. They grill the food in front of you and you can choose what you want to eat. As starter you can of course get a miso soup that is very good. I would recommend the mixed teppanyaki. The sushi here is also good, but nothing super special in my opinion.  I will come back here for sure. The service is very good.   My other two Japanese favorites in town is Yonaka Modern Japanese and Raku"}
{"text":"The sushi is always delicious. I sit at the bar have had conversations with the chefs right in front of me who are rolling and they are always very friendly. I love the option they have of black rice with your roll! The only reason I'm not giving it 5 is because they are on the more expensive side and I can find rolls like that at other locations for cheaper."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place! Tried some different good ones but none can compare to Osaka! Rudy is amazing & friendly & so are the rest of the servers! Love it!"}
{"text":"When I ordered a vegetarian dish from this menu, I was very disappointed receive beef stock soup and beef products also delivered with the dish. What a waste! Also, some weird potato salad was smothering the tempura I ordered, so it was soggy by the time it was delivered."}
{"text":"Came here on a busy Friday night.  The place was packed.  We had an assortment of sushi, and the teppanyaki.  I can't say enough about the excellent service and attention to detail.  All the sushi was delicious, try the sushi lasagna (omg, to die for!).  The teppan grill was great.  We had steak and salmon but first they served us soup and rice.  The soup was really yummy and I loved the little noodles, very yummy.  The fried rice was great (and cute pacman while they make it for the kids), and the meat and veges were so fresh.  The entire meal was just a pleasure.  The staff was so attentive.  They have a cool ordering system - they don't even have to go to the kitchen to place the order.  They just put it into their little handheld and the kitchen starts making your food.  The sushi came out so fast, we were hungry!  Can't wait to go back!  We were so full we only had room for a scoop of green tea ice cream.  The dessert menu looks amazing and I love all the pictures."}
{"text":"I went there tonight to celebrate my birthday. I had a group of 13, we sat for dinner and 2 minutes later the grease trap fell from the top Of the tepan table and drenched me,  My sister in law and my MK clutch with grease!!! It took the servers several minutes to realize what happened and there was no sense of urgency to fix the situation. They ended up moving us to another section and 15 minutes later they apologized for the incident. I had taken several bottles of champagne to celebrate my birthday and the servers did not know how to open the bottles!! My husband and friends ended up having to open the champagne bottles and serve it themselves!!!! The service was awful. The only thing that made this night better was zac, our tepan cook. He was great. Our entrees were also great, however the soup and salad was not very good. Overall it was a poor experience and I will not be back."}
{"text":"Quick Review: Great value in the late night menu, good, but expensive food at other times of the day.  Long-Winded Review: When I grew up in Vegas in the 80's, there were only 1-2 Japanese restaurants in town, but they were very authentic ones that served food you could find in Tokyo.  Fast forward 20 years and we have a Sushi restaurant on every corner.  Teriyaki Chicken is served at Jack in the Box.  You can get California Rolls at 7-11.  There are hundreds of \"Japanese\" restaurants out now, but they're as close to Japanese as Olive Garden is Italian.  Osaka's menu remains largely grounded in its Japanese roots, but it also features a good selection of \"custom\" sushi rolls that you'll find in other sushi restaurants.  The menu is extensive, and some parts may be difficult to navigate since it is in Japanese (or the English equivalent, Romaji).  Item descriptions are all too brief and unless you've been there before, you may be intimidated by ordering something new.  It's probably best to ask your server or sushi chef questions before ordering.  What troubles me about Osaka is that I feel it's trying to be all things to all people.  It serves authentic Japanese fare, but it's also trying to be edgy, trendy, and hip by offering experimental fusion dishes and desserts.  However, the fact that I still go there regularly suggests that Osaka's experimentation doesn't bother me all that much.  As with older Japanese restaurants, prices are a tad higher than other places in town ($15 for chicken teriyaki dinner vs. $9.95 at other places), but the quality is much better.  You're not going to get as much food, but if you're looking for quantity, I can suggest some good all-you-can-eat sushi places that will feed you for under $30.  The real value of Osaka is its late night menu (10 pm - 2 am).  It features a wide variety of food for under $10.  You can get rolls and appetizers for $5 or less, and entrees are available for under $10.  The Japanese Style Beef Bowl is a steal at $5.80 (it's like a Yoshinoya Beef Bowl, but tastier).  It's a great place to go with friends after/before clubbing since you can do a family-style meal.  Desserts are hit or miss.  The Tempura Ice Cream is a great value at $5.50 and it easily serves 2-4 people.  Some of the other items are good, but definitely not worth the high price."}
{"text":"This was my second time to Osaka and I (we) really enjoyed it both times. Teppan was good the first time and great the second. We had sushi as an appetizer both times (albacore sashimi and the pocket aces) and was not disappointed. Riochi was our cook this time and we was awesome!   I would say for the amount of food you get the prices are very fair. My wife and I shared this time and still had leftovers."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite sushi restaurant in Nevada.  The fish is always the freshest.  The food is just top of the line.  The service is always very good as well.  I remember reading that Osaka in Henderson was on a list of the 50 best sushi restaurants in the world...and the other 49 were in Japan, so that kind of says something right there.  I highly recommend this location.  I was not as crazy about the other locations as they didn't have the same awesome quality of fish and pleasant atmosphere."}
{"text":"It is in a strip mall and it is not ritzy, but the food..is so killer. The price is reasonable. Take people like your family to this place. Nothing fancy. Drink some tea, get a ramen or teishoku and eat some good food. Go to this place if you want good Japanese food. The owner and cooks are Japanese so it is authentic. Go to Japan if you want better Japanese comfort food. I cannot believe a place like this exists in Las Vegas!! Everytime I go to Vegas, I go to this place. I ordered the Tempura and katsu, last time I went.  It was crispy and full of flavor."}
{"text":"Not the best but not bad for late night after hours. This is one of those places you go to when nothing else is open other than fast food or cafes in hotels. Tasty sushi, hit or miss on maguro sashimi.  The edamame portion has recently been shaved to a small handful of pods, at $2.95, now that's a rip off.  I had to work on Valentines, which by the way is a WAY overrated day, non the less the BF and I had a late night meal. He had the tonkatsu which he said was fabulous. I had sashimi and one roll. Like I said, not bad for late night dining, 1 in the morning. BTW, they close at 2"}
{"text":"We have been going to the Osaka on Sahara for years.  If you can get past the crazy entrance and the basic first dining room, you will be impressed with the other rooms, the prices, and the tasty food.  We love the choices offered, and it is always fresh and prepared to our specifications.,  We had friends fly in for business, and told them to go there to eat.  they really questioned my recommendations as they entered, but at the end of the meal, they raved and raved."}
{"text":"Amazing service!  We had Joe as our Teppan-yaki chef and he was entertaining. The waitress staff was there at every moment. We have visited several Teppan restaurants and the service is by far the best!"}
{"text":"I had never had sushi before.  I have always been afraid to try it.  So, I went here with some friends.  My friend ordered all kinds of sushi for me to try.  My other friend eats Vegan so she ordered some vegan rolls.  All I can say is that I could not stop eating the rolls we had.  Obviously I know nothing about sushi but I can't stop thinking about this place and I can't wait to go back.  We were there a little late and it's got a great little vibe.  Amazing customer service."}
{"text":"has the best food here love the theme and the cooking show it is really cool"}
{"text":"My new favorite sushi spot, very very very good fish. I used to go to the AYCE spots but once I started eating the sashimi at Osaka I can't stop. The Blue fin tuna is amazing, If you are looking for a really good sushi place in vegas this is it."}
{"text":"As we walked in, we thought the seating area was small but were seated immediately.  But, we found out later, they have two hibachi-style tables and many tatami mat tables as you go further into the restaurant.  Food was okay, nothing special.  Service was unimpressive.  Waiter did not engage, no expression or enthusiasm or suggestions  as we asked about the menu items.  As diners, we did not feel that welcomed. As we paid and as we left, there was nothing said by any of the workers.  I guess they don't really appreciate patronage.  Wouldn't bother coming back."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place because it is so close to home, but nothing special. Everything...chicken bowl, 777, Kai special roll, miso soup was just okay."}
{"text":"I eat here at least once EVERY TIME I visit Vegas.  It's not your 100% authentic Japanese sushi place but hey I'm not a sushi snob.  I would have to say that they have the largest selection of Americanized Sushi Rolls anywhere.  The 777 roll is my favorite.  The \"hot\" foods are not bad but pale in comparison to their rolls.  Order a few of the special rolls and you're good to go.  California Rockin Sushi has NOTHING on this place.  In fact ever since I started going to Osaka I refuse to ever eat at CRS."}
{"text":"I don't know if i would come back here. So here is the review.   My boyfriend and I went to Osaka to try out their late night menu.   $11 for 6 piece sashimi, $7 for some of their half rolls, $22 for fresh scallop (not part of late night menu). Wanted to get the fresh Uni, but they sold out. Got the wings, Gyu Maki and shrimp shumai as appetizers.  Everything just seemed off. First of all the quality of the fish was not great. Really thin pieces, and almost dry. Got a white tiger roll, it was okay, like the Bonzai sauce, but everything else was just really plain. Fried wings were bland and just looked sad accompanied with raw broccoli and dry carrots.  No music was playing so it got really awkward cuz the sushi chefs were just busy making orders and they didn't even make eye contact with us. If it wasn't for the TV behind the bar we don't know if we would be able sit through our meal.  In the end, we just ate really quick and left. Like I said before, don't know if I would revisit again, maybe if they spruce up the atmosphere a little bit and get better quality of food."}
{"text":"I have visited Osaka's on Eastern on/off for the past few years. The last time was the other Saturday. All I can truly say is Awesome! We had all varieties of food: from sushi and appetizers to several maim dishes like the teriyaki and kutzu. The food tasted great, the service was very quick and attentive. My Favorite roll is actually the Ponytail. Its a cooked chicken rolls, but very Delish!!"}
{"text":"Another great experience at Osaka's!!! We decided to have our NYE dinner at the Sahara location. The food rocked, flavors were well balanced and there was plenty of  left overs to bring home. I have never had a bad experience at this location or the Henderson location. The food always looks and taste fresh and amazing. The prices are always reasonable and you get the quality of high end food... I will make Osaka's a 2013 restaurant  for sure...   FYI, GET THE TEMPURA ICE CREAM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Well, the gal and I rolled in at about 1:30 AM.  The place was pretty empty.  The atmosphere:  a little dreary, diveish, and old but overall fairly clean.  The service was decent.  Nothing to gripe or write home about.    The food:  forgettable.  The Korean style chicken was utter crap.  Stir-fried and all you could taste was spice.  Hello?  Korean chicken is supposed to be deep-fried.    I also ordered the udon off the late-night menu.  The broth had completely no taste whatsover.  They could have used minimal effort to load it with salt and MSG and that would have been a huge improvement, though not very imaginitive.    The gyoza was ok but obviously store-bought.    Would I go again?  No, I would rather go to Albertsons' and buy a microwave dinner."}
{"text":"Ate at the teppan grill with my family! The chef kept us all entertained, and the overall experience was pleasant. We ordered scallops, ribeye, chicken, and filet mignon. They use a crap ton of butter on everything they cook, but we enjoyed the food nonetheless. (I think excessive butter might be the reason why I devoured the food but shhhh.)"}
{"text":"Highly recommend tatami room. We brought our 11-year-old son and he really enjoyed the experience. The sushi was awesome and fresh. Only disappointment was they did not offer specials. We previously visited Eastern location and appreciated the newness of the building, but certainly enjoyed the original location on Sahara. The service was superb, especially because after my son's second Shirley Temple the waiter offered to make him his signature drink called the Tiger Woods. It was a mixture of lemonade and raspberry tea. He loved it and we thought it was an extremely kind gesture by the waiter."}
{"text":"The late night happy hour is NOT to be missed!   The Japanese Lasagna is gooey-NOM-NOM and the Oh My God is a favorite as well.   Can't go wrong on that menu!"}
{"text":"Amazing... really good! If your in vegas this place is a hidden gem. Best lunch specials and lovely service. Everything is fresh."}
{"text":"I am not a sushi expert by any means, but last night,  I got to experience a wonderful dinner there with a friend who is. Everything I had; pot stickers, the 777 roll, and tasting my friends sashimi style everything , omg! The atmosphere was casual and fun. The service was  awesome too! Huge selection on the menu, hard to pick when your a novice, and the saki was devine. I look forward to going back there soon!"}
{"text":"I never thought o would give this place a bad review. I have eaten here a few times in the past and had a great experience, however the most recent visit was not one.  I called earlier in the day to ask if I needed a reservation for the hibachi grill and the lady who answered said it would be a good idea, so I made one. We arrived about five minutes before the reservation and there was no host/hostess and the entire restaurant was empty with staff walking around. We waited a few minutes before I found someone and asked if we could be seated. She said they were cleaning and I would have to wait.  We were seated and our order was taken. My girlfriend specifically said she did not want rice. The dude came out to cook our meal, forgot to make us the shrimp appetizer and put my extra rice on her plate. I asked for our shrimp once he was done and he immediately cooked it for us. No one came to ask if we were doing okay or if we would like more to drink. I can understand if the place was busy and they were slow to come around to check on us, but we were the only patrons in the restaurant. I was a bit shocked at the experience. The food was great, but I will not be returning due to the sheer lack of service."}
{"text":"Although the food is great I had a terrible encounter with the wait staff who insisted that they only took cards with the chip. That is the most absurd thing I've ever heard. This dimwit did not know how to process a regular debit card. She probably did not know how to process cash. She actually had the nerve to tell me that next time I'm here please use the card with the chip. Is this ridiculous or what?. Buyer beware. Money is money. Ignorance is ignorant. I guess I'll  head over to Spicy Tuna next time I want sushi. At Spicy Tuna those folks take cash, debit card, credit card, and check. Perhaps they have a more intelligent wait staff."}
{"text":"Very pricey for hibachi, seemed very dark and dirty. It was so smokey that my eyes were watering the entire meal. Tried it once won't be back."}
{"text":"My go to spot for some good brew n good sushi,open late night so thats good.never super packed like other sushi spots"}
{"text":"My family love coming to this restaurant. It's The Place to come for after hour for their special menu. They have the best tempura crab legs that you can't get anywhere else. My husband introduced me to this place 6 years ago and we have been coming here ever since. Everything on their menu are so delicious and the price is great too. We always take our family and friends here whenever we are in the city or when I come here for business trip. Never miss a dinner here when we are staying at the strip. The staff here are so friendly and awesome. Rudy has been serving us ever since my husband took me here. And he is still here at the restaurant. We come here not just for some great and delicious sushi and tempura crab legs but to visit our friend Rudy too. Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"The food was not good at all.... No seasoning to the food... Was the worse hibachi restaurant I have ever experienced.  WILL NEVER come back... Maybe it was the chef and his cooking but the hibachi was BAD No taste... I wasted  $77.00 we should of complain and not paid. We ate about 4 bites and was ready to go..  The service was nice it was the hibachi that we did not like... Need to teach the cooks how to season the food properly."}
{"text":"We sat at the teppanyaki table for dinner tonight and it was great. I had the fillet and chicken. The food was top notch and the chef put in a great show while cooking. I also liked that the table was smaller then other places i have been, it made for easier conversation. I highly recommend Osaka!"}
{"text":"In Vegas for the first time and wanted to try something off the strip.. found this place loved it great service atmosphere and the employees were attentive and made you feel welcomed. Great food great price! Definitely a place to come back too"}
{"text":"Such good sushi and plum wine. And very nice service. Best spicy tuna in town. I come here every week."}
{"text":"the greatest thing about this place is that they are consistent. you always know what your going to get. i only know this because i've been a patron for over 5 years. also the staff is always friendly and the restaurant is super clean and comfortable.  this place is more of a locals spot which i love. the quality of ingredients is top notch and they have a great late night and happy hour specials.  i only wish they had a few options for vegetarians ( but it is a sushi place.. hehe)  other than that i can't think of any complaints."}
{"text":"Apparently the tepanyaki portion doesn't open until 4. They have a very limited lunch menu. I called before I came down to make sure they were open but they didn't mention the limited menu so when I took a $30 cap from the strip I was very disappointed"}
{"text":"without a doubt the best Japanese cuisine I've had in ages. Everything was extremely fresh, beautifully prepared and delivered with a smile. This was a real find for us as we were working in the area and stumbled upon it... LOVE it, highly recommend! You won't be disappointed. And leave room for dessert.... just sayin'"}
{"text":"It doesn't get any better than this! Best quality! Best Chef and Knife! Amazing variety and new creations! Can compete any day with chef Nobu and his partners"}
{"text":"If you enjoy Sushi or Teppan style dining - you MUST visit Osaka.  For years I've gone to the orgininal one on Sahara - but I live closer to the new one on Eastern.  The food is fresh and wonderful and they have half orders on the sushi rolls so 2 people can try a bigger variety.  The Teppan grill is also delicious and entertaing.  Leave room for dessert because the fried oreos are to die for!"}
{"text":"I took my fiance here on a formal date and this place was perfect! We sat at a tatami room for just him and I, it is a traditional japanese room were you have to remove your shoes and sit on your knees. It was so comfortable though and we felt like we was the only ones here because the rice screens separates all the tables and it feels more like a private dinner. I loved it! Oh and right when you walk in you are greeted from every person you pass by who works there. Our waitress was so nice and have a sense of humor. In the menu there was just so much to chose from. We were soo full but my fiance still wanted to try the desert which was the fried tempura ice cream. Damn I was good to go after that. It was like a orgasm in your mouth haha. Well I would definately go here again but only on special occassions."}
{"text":"We had an amazing time at this place! Driving up it didn't look like much, and entrance would fool you too. But the food was out of this world! We had sushi and teppanyski, and it was so good that I did not wan to stop eating even though I was full. Highly recommended this place"}
{"text":"Hands down the best sushi experience in town, the sushi is the shizznit and the atmosphere makes you feel like your in japan. Udon and miso soup is the best no one elses can compare. A bit on the pricer side but you get what you pay for"}
{"text":"I did a last minute google search and landed on a local Vegas blog that said this place had amazing, fresh, innovative Japanese dishes.... so we went and were wowed. Don't be put off by the seedy area, it is located in the mini-mall with the mini statue of liberty statue and next to the store that sells, um... sexy attire. We were 5 adults and 6 kids and every single one of us were incredibly happy. We showed up for early 6pm dinner and were seated on tatami mats.  The menu is wide and varied, but it had things for picky non-adventurous types and others like me and my BFF who went for urchin and hand rolls and their specialty rolls.. The rolls were innovative. you can order individual yakitori freshly grilled, fresh ebi sashimi with their crispy fried heads, their udon was enjoyed by my 70 year old dad and 5 year old daughter, and the atmosphere made my manga-loving nieces very happy. The waiters handled our big ole table deftly and with patience. I recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Hands down, the BEST sushi / sashimi for us ever!  Great atmosphere (very comfortable), super nice (and artistic) chefs, interesting new things to try, and desert to die for.  I don't write that many reviews, but had to sing the praises of this place.  Highly recommended!  We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"This a cute lil random sushi place near herbs and rye. Has a great ambiance, when you sit at a table you have to take your shoes off and sit on a pillow. Kind of a fun concept. The only thing that sucked was that it wasn't all you could eat! I would definitely reccommend it to sushi lovers considering they had some rare fish!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is so cute and small. The entrance is kind of weird and there is literally a wall right when you open the door. But as far as the food, it was delicious! I got the beef teriyaki plate and ordered the u-my roll. Both were good, but the banzai sauce on my roll was a little bit spicy that I wasn't aware of. Most of the rolls included something spicy so I would advise you not to order that if you don't prefer that. The staff was very nice and attended to our table often. And overall it was a good experience :)"}
{"text":"Great variety, quality, & service! Stopped by for a quick dinner, served right away. A true gem!"}
{"text":"Never been here but this place was on the \" dirty diner report\" on the channel 13 news tonight."}
{"text":"This place really lived up to our expectations.  We love going to teppan grill style restaurants and we have a favorite one back home in California.  So on vacation in Vegas we decided to try this place out.  It was just as good as our place back home and priced about the same.  Our chef, hurricane pho, was awesome and fun.  Would definitely recommend the teppan grill to anyone looking for good affordable food in Vegas."}
{"text":"Best sushi I have eaten in Las Vegas. I have eaten at both the Sahara restaurant (many years ago) and currently only go to the Eastern location when I want sushi. Always good fresh sushi and always good service."}
{"text":"Food was okay and came in a timely manner. I was disappointed with the customer service. They were very monotoned, and in my eyes customer service can always hype an over-all experience. I'm giving a poor rating and won't recommend any family or friends. This experience was nothing special and won't be remembered. If the staff manager reads these reviews I encourage coaching your team to be more personable."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Osaka - Henderson. The quality of their food is very consistent and their prices are reasonable. I always order the 911 roll and Miso Ramen soup. My kids enjoy their vegetable fried rice and Kalbi beef sticks. The teppan grill is a great value because of the portions and entertainment. If you're looking for a deal, go there during Happy Hour (starts at 10 pm nightly). I highly recommend this place if you have the munchies in the middle of the night."}
{"text":"I frequent this restaurant quite often.....I came in tonight at 9:50 to have dinner. I wasn't acknowledged until 10:10. Only 2 other tables came in 5 mins after me. I was greeted by my server who seems over whelmed, she apologized and I understood since I've been in hospitality for 10 years! She took my order (4 small items for HH menu all ordered at the same time)  The other 2 tables that's came in after me already started receiving food.I didn't receive my my first item until 10:40. I asked where everything else was and she said it was coming and that the cooks probably did my ticket in the wrong order. I told her I was patient with her after acknowledging me so late that now this is unacceptable. And that I'm sure she forgot to put in my order. 10:50 2 more items show up. 11:00 the server comes to me and asks if I want to cancel my last order I told her I would like to speak to a manager. Another male server came to give me my last item I told him I don't want it and wanted to speak to a manager. He said the manager was gone and he was the one in charge. I explained my situation and he also blamed the chefs saying that they're new. He offered a to take the last item off my bill. Big wow you removed something off my bill that I didn't eat, that I ordered nearly a hour ago!!!! He ended up giving me a discount , but because of the way the \"manager\" handled it I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I typically come for the late night happy hour menu, 10p-2a. Half size/half price rolls, and specials on their tempura and seafood, other appetizers, and sake specials. Can't beat that!"}
{"text":"Miso Ramen is just ok. Sashimi and Roll combo is just ok. Good service :-)"}
{"text":"My favorite sushi spot. The food is killer and the staff exceptional. I like to go solo, sit at the sushi bar, and watch the chefs work their magic. Sushi is an art unto itself."}
{"text":"Customer service deserves 5 stars. Food is good quality but the amount you get for the price is the reason I took a star off. We got the small sashimi platter that you can share with 2 or more people and the slices of the fish were a little small. They charged us for sides of rice which usually come with sashimi dinners. They also charged for green tea which most authentic places from home don't but this is also Vegas without many Japanese options."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to take the kids to dinner one night. First time trying this place, although we've been in the neighborhood for years. We sat at the teppan grill, and it was awesome . Our chef was the highlight of the night.... Lots of props and kept us laughing. He had us catch shrimp in our mouths and even had a cheech and Chong pic. Food was really good! We agreed that it was the best filet we've had. Service was great... We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome for several reasons.  One the food is amazing.  The fried rice is the best.  Two the cook/entertainers are friendly and funny.  If you have kids, this is a great place to take them for a family dinner night as they will love watching them make the dinner."}
{"text":"Just got out from this place and decided to write a review. Why? Because I read so many reviews about their service being suck and I have to disagree!   It was 1PM and it wasn't too busy (I think there are 3 occupied tables, a family at tatami, and few people on sushi bar). We were greeted and asked whether we would like to sit on table or tatami. We chose tatami and so directed to back area.   All of the waitresses were very nice and helpful. In fact, when my husband ordered a Ten Zaru Soba (cold noodle) from their regular menu, the waiter informed us that the item also available in Lunch Specials menu and for the same price, we would get tempura (2 pieces of shrimp) on the side. I really appreciate this kind of gesture. Especially because of the last review I read when I stepped out of the car said that this place \"WILL RIP YOU OFF\"!   They also gave out our drinks then miso soups then our food promptly. We tried: - Oh Kamisama (tempura roll with spicy tuna on the top and spicy mayo sauce) ~ very good and fresh - Broiled Eel bento box ~ very good - Tonkatsu bento box ~ 'twas OK - Ten Zaru Soba (cold noodle) ~ pretty good according to husband  Food presentation was really good.  Waitresses keep checking if we were doing OK but in a non-annoying way. They just popped in and out; I think to make sure that we didn't have to go out from our tatami booth to get them.   So yeah, overall, my experience was a very good and enjoyable one."}
{"text":"Went here after skimming the Desert Magazine and reading how this place offers a cheap late-night dining menu. I was intrigued by the $5 ramen and the inexpensive sushi rolls.  The good: -There is a wide variety of items offered on the late-night menu, most under/at $5 and all under $10. Things like tempura, skewers, and edamame. -They also offer their regular menu this late. -They are open till 2am every day.  The bad: -The service was SLOW. The people were nice and they got our drinks to us early, but then disappeared for a while before taking our food order. And then it took us at least 30 min to get our food. The place wasn't packed and there seemed to be enough staff to handle the current crowd. -Even though the list of sushi rolls on the late-night menu were around $4-$11, they were only HALF rolls.  The food was just ok, and I feel like if I had paid more for it, then I wouldn't have enjoyed the food as much. Maybe I should come back and try the regular menu items? I'm not sure if I would be willing to, but for the convenience of their business hours, I might stop by again if I want some sushi at 1am."}
{"text":"I  didn't splurge on any of the specialty rolls but the rolls I got were cheap and delicious."}
{"text":"Excellent Food and Excellent Service......We had a last minute reservation for 13 of us and they were happy to accomodate us.  We could not asked for a better experience!"}
{"text":"Love the tatami seating, great sushi, delicious teppanyaki"}
{"text":"The hot food was delicious but the sushi was horrible and had to much rice on the outside. I do not suggest this place for sushi at all!"}
{"text":"Dafne was very unprofessional rude and had a very bad attitude came from out of town to be treated badly and I had a party of 2 and want to charge me 18% gruiti what kind of business is this I would never go back again stealing from people is wrong"}
{"text":"One of the best sushi restaurant in Vegas. I've tried many different sushi here and they were all delicious and fresh. Especially the special fish off the menu board were so authentic. Staff is very good and polite. Chef is very professional. Atmosphere was nice. They have many Japanese \"tatami\"style booth, very private. You feel like eating sushi in Japan!!!  I definitely recommend this place and come back soon!!!!"}
{"text":"Best sushi place I've found in Vegas and their teppan grill is great too! The fish is great quality- the only place in Vegas where I can order tuna and yellowtail nigiri and know it will be on point every time! And the place is really cute and comfy the way it's set up."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of 5 for a birthday dinner a few weeks ago. Everybody loved it. We had one of the tables in the back to ourselves (I thought it was kinda fun eating with no shoes on) and the service was very quick. 2 of us came specifically for the Okonomi Yaki and we were not disappointed. We'll definitely be coming back here."}
{"text":"My husband and I were very disappointed in the service we received here. We are huge fans of Samurai (on sunset and marks) and had heard that Osaka was very similar. It being closer to our house, we decided it was worth a try and regretted it greatly. We waited in the front to be seated for 20 minutes. There was nobody else waiting and no staff member at the hostess stand. My husband had to go into the dining area 3 times to get someone's attention. There were maybe 4 other groups in the entire restaurant so there so no reason for such negligence. Once we were seated we continuously had to flag down staff members so that we could place our order, then once the food finally came it was subpar. As if that wasn't bad enough, they are incredibly costly. I don't mind paying a lot  for good food and good service but this was not deserving of it's price tag in the slightest. No plans of every returning to this disappointing establishment."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service!!! Had a groupon for that location and the owner wouldn't accept it. Said he wouldn't get a paycheck. Wasn't offered any other explanation or comp item. I spent money to go to a place I wouldn't have gone too and because of their error they won't see my face again."}
{"text":"It is one of the places in Vegas that has been around awhile and not to mention burned down and worth rebuilding. The service for some reason has always be excellent. It use to be where I took dates. The sushi is decent and what I enjoyed the most was the atmosphere. If you buy an Osaka shirt, every visit gets you a bottle of saki. I am a huge sushi lover and fancy sushi has become pretty typical. Every time I have been there and sat at the bar they offer a complimentary bottle of saki. Nice! Just a nice place to go."}
{"text":"Great OG sushi house ,everyone is super nice and the food delicious  Highly recommended !!!"}
{"text":"What a great place.  Everyone was friendly.  The food was delicious.  Dinner for five and a child with drinks about $275.  The chef put on quite a show for us."}
{"text":"If you want fresh, you want Osaka.  Great late night specials too"}
{"text":"Osaka is a first place tie for best sushi in Las Vegas in my book. They have a great menu full of super fresh fish that never disappoints. The staff are really nice and attentive. The chefs attention to detail in both presentation and flavor is what truly sets this place apart from the rest."}
{"text":"I love their calamari grill, kampachi, the quality of their tuna is the best in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Love the Osaka Special with fried rice. Always good with awesome fried rice. Friendly service as well. We come at least 4 times a year :)"}
{"text":"I always bring friends abd family here when there in town. I live the admiril feist. Getting ready to have now. Yummy!!"}
{"text":"Wednesday nights I love their live music by the bar. Food is good nothing extraordinary, ordered some rolls and fried rice and gyozas.service was good. I will return mainly for the music."}
{"text":"Excellent service from the time we sat down until we left. Food was excellent without being way large a portion.  Very enjoyable evening. The kids love the hibachi style and the friendly chefs."}
{"text":"Swear by this place. They have the best salmon!! Great for a date or to go with friends. The staff is amazing and always super friendly. Food comes out fast which I appreciate! Luckily, I've never been one to let decor effect how much I enjoy my dinner. We love the live Jazz!!!"}
{"text":"best sushi place ive been to by far ! kinda pricy, but its worth it"}
{"text":"First time here at Osaka.  My sweetheart brought me here and we had the treasure chest , totally like it the tempura was on  point and so was the tuna salad .  Never had warm sake my baby popped my cherry on that one and im still on the fence on SAKE!!. She just ordered dessert Tempura ice cream with chocolate syrup in sure its going to be off the hook , cant go wrong with any kind of ice cream. Moderately priced and good fish quality. I recommend the tatami room if your good and fit but if your a big boy like get the regular table ! Since dinner started I've been planning my exit from the table, we will be coming back fo sho."}
{"text":"I'll try to keep this brief... Upon arrival there were minors doing homework at the bar; highly inappropriate. The hibachi tables and surroundings were filthy, so were the menus. The service was just OK. They forgot the appetizer, we never got them. The fried rice was so salty that it was inedible. The entrees were seriously below standards, bland and blah. There was no \"show\". I had a pepper shaker thrown at me - yes, it was an accident but it was greasy and it just added to my irritation. Bottom line: are you kidding me? For this kind of money you can get infinitely better food, better environment and better service."}
{"text":"Love the late night menu . They also have seating in the back which is very traditional and Private"}
{"text":"Of the prodigious Japanese restaurants in this town, Osaka Japanese Bistro is one of my two favorites. (I reviewed the other one on Yelp with 5 stars, also). Osaka served me last night some fresh tuna poki salad that is too sublime to describe. Their tempura vegetables--zucchini, yam, and a red onion ring--were deep-fried with fresh oil, noticeable right away from the pale coloring of the breading and the way the taste of the vegetables were enhanced--not overpowered from previously used oil. (This is the mark of a 1st-tier sushi bar. 2nd-tier sushi bars in Japan actually purchased first-use oil from the top tier.)  Traditional tekka maki along with a plethora of other sushi rolls all complemented each other to be washed down with Osaka's signature apple saketini.  I cannot stress enough the importance of wait staff in the dining experience. The fact that I was surprised at how surreptitiously my drink was refilled or how my bill just appeared out of thin air is testimony to the efficacy of front-of-house operations. (I should have expected their efficiency when I noticed our server using an electronic order pad with stylus to take our order!)  Good staff do what they are told, and the staff here were well above that standard: they anticipated my wants.  If local Las Vegans want to experience dining excellence, they should look no further than Osaka Japanese Bistro."}
{"text":"Unbelievably horrible!! Came in for the first time tonight at 11:40pm with no one to greet us... Had to find our way inside to the dining room only to meet a girl who didn't look too happy to see us, didn't care that we were there... Didn't look at us while she was talking to us. Wasn't sure if she was our server or just a hostess? Anyway, worst sushi experience ever"}
{"text":"We first came here at 2003 and have been coming back every time we visit Vegas for Sema Show   Last time we were here was 2012 and we were very happy.   We came here again today 2017, and I must say, it was absolutely delicious. We got the white tiger, Kai and treasure roll. Blue fin sushi  The fish is ridiculously fresh and extremely tasty, it must be imported from Japan daily  We came here again with our team, and was served by David. He was an amazing host and convinced us to get their rib eye hibachi that arrived in the morning and hasn't been frozen yet.  It was OMG!!!!!!!!!  We all tasted it an no one has ever tried this most amazing steak!  I tried it and I have tasted some of the most expensive steaks in New York, and hands out this was the best steak I have ever tasted in my life.  Keep up the good work! And we will defiantly be back again."}
{"text":"We are regulars here. On may 2. 2014  our usual party of five showed up for my sons birthday. Now we love eating here but as we were seated in the back at the teppan table a large cockroach crawled out from the side of the grill and headed toward my daughter....the manager just smiled said he would kill it and moved us to the next table! No offers of any kind followed! This was disgusting and will surely end our  twice monthly dinners there-gross!!!"}
{"text":"My first experience with real sushi (not grocery store or deli counter sushi).  Loved every bite.  Even got adventurous and ate the face off of a giant shrimp creature.  Eyeball stalks, and all.  That may have been a garnish.  I don't know, it was also my first fling with the sake.  Speaking of sake...this is also the only place I've found that served a particular sake which was brewed by females, to cater to females.  Came in a frosted pink bottle.  Little bit sweeter than other sakes I've tried, but good...and the bottle looked precious, with a pretty flower stuck in, nestled on my girlfriend's nightstand.    I tried many new things, here.  Sashimi of various sorts, seaweed salad, eel sauce, tako and tamago...always attractively presented and delicious.  Went here several times over the years in Las Vegas.  Never had a meal I didn't thoroughly enjoy, never had a server who wasn't friendly and outgoing, never had any fellow guests complain about taking off their shoes, never had a menu recommendation that went unappreciated,   never had a check that raised my eyebrows.    My only beef with the place was the smell...the last few times I went, everything past the sushi bar smelled like a sewer.  Now, I managed food places for a long time, and I know that once there's a problem in the lines under the building, it can be a bear (a big, angry, expensive bear) to get taken care of.  But in a sit-down joint with aspirations towards the classy, aged poo cannot be allowed to waft.    SO...if someone can confirm for me that the smell has been taken care of (my nose now being several hours to the south), I'll bump this review up a notch."}
{"text":"Osaka really provides a stellar EXPERIENCE while you eat great food- with a sushi bar, tatami rooms OR teppan grill tables.  With their standard menu spanning almost 10 pages theres certainly no shortage of that while also not dominishing any of the specialty in their dishes they manage to offer a lot more diversity than your typical china town sushi place- even in the typical dishes.  They are always willing to customize & offer extremely attentice service, accompanying their ginger/wasabi with a lightly dressed cucumber salad.  O"}
{"text":"Osaka has some of the best sushi in town. It's always fresh, and the prices are reasonable--particularly on the late-night happy hour menu, which runs from 10 to 2.  Last night, we had an early dinner at the sushi bar. (You can also sit at tables in the small front restaurant or dine at the teppan grill in the back, but we always come just for sushi, so we prefer to sit in front of the chefs.) As usual, we ordered a full rainbow roll and a half dragon. And to change it up, we tried two half rolls that we had never ordered before: the fresh white (albacore and hamachi topped with a tangy sauce); and the Treasure Island (salmon, hamachi, and capers--like a Japanese take on a bagel and lox). Both were fine, although the TI was a little tart because it was topped with a thin lemon slice. We much preferred our usual fare; you can't go wrong with fresh fish and eel.  We also split an order of the spicy garlic edamame, upon a friend's suggestion. Meh. And I got a large Sapporo beer. Yum! This feast cost just over $50, and it was pretty tasty. My only issue with the meal was that the rolls weren't rolled tightly enough, so they kept falling apart. Not a game changer, but still ...  Osaka was recently featured on \"Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives,\" so we were expecting it to be full of tourists. Thankfully, it wasn't. Lots of locals, and the same low-key atmosphere that we've grown to expect.  There are several Osakas in town, but this is the best--especially if you're a fan of rainbows and dragons!"}
{"text":"Great stop if your on Sahara. The fish was surprisingly fresh and the staff amiable. Would have been a 3 star review had it not been for the quality of fish and a unique assortment of specials. The Osaka or grunt fish was the bet I've had. Highly recommended for a quick bite but seating is a little cramped so no large parties."}
{"text":"Authentic traditional sushi at its finest. The Japanese style tables with mats to sit on is pretty awesome. The sushi is delicious and creative. The flavors of the sushi sandwich were oh so good. The lunch specials are convenient for my co-workers and I. Staff is always great!"}
{"text":"Been here twice now with my boyfriend and both times we have loved it! Our main chef is chef Ray! He is the best by far! He's quick, and always notices when your ready for another roll.! The Mochi there is amazing, 3 for $5.95.?! Can't beat that!! Will definitely be back again to see Chef Ray"}
{"text":"Tuesday's has two for one appetizers. Go for the mussels, nachos, tuna, Brussels sprouts, and the halibut tacos."}
{"text":"I  went   there  last  Sunday   and  men  !!!   really  god  sushi   I  think  come  back   asap"}
{"text":"Had a fantastic time here with a fairly large party!  The staff was very accommodating and we weren't made to feel like an inconvenience even with the size of our group.  The place has a very authentic feel and I very much enjoyed the Sushi, as well as some of the specialty beverages that they serve.  Worth a visit if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Nice place to have sushi and rolls. The food is fine, fresh and tastes good.  Maybe a bit plain. The interior is not fancy, dining rooms are small and dark.  But the ice cream... Wow, like it so much! I am thinking stop by only to get some :)"}
{"text":"Good sushi.  They have 4 different seating options: Booth, Sushi Bar, Grillside & Shoes Off Floor.  Decent sushi at decent prices."}
{"text":"Why busy at night?  Because not too many restaurants are open.  It doesn't means that the restaurant serving under cook fish or tempura not even brown yet. Server and chef's need to more training."}
{"text":"Amazing food. I order to go from here 2-3x a week. However, tonight I called to place a to go order and I was very rudely told that they no longer accepted to-go orders over the phone and that I would have to come in and place my order. What? If I wanted to sit there for 30 minutes I would just dine-in. Extremely disappointed to be treated like this by a place I've been patronizing for a long time. I love the food but will no longer be giving this place my business. 5 stars for food quality, 1 for customer service. Beyond disappointed in you Osaka."}
{"text":"We love Osaka!!!  They have very fresh, delicious sushi and sashimi.   There are very few restaurants around that I could say that about.  We've been there many times in the past 4 years and never been disappointed.  As for the person complaining about the price, I understand that you want to have accurate information, however $40.00 per person is very average for a full dinner of sashimi and sushi.  We've paid that much at any sushi restaurant we've ever been to.  (even the gross ones)  This place really does rock though!!!"}
{"text":"Food was great. Our chef Joe Hibachi was hilarious. A little pricier than other tepan grills."}
{"text":"Sometimesyoy get more than what you pay for--that sums it up in a nutshell. The rolls are buttery goodness. My sister and I sat in one of the wood bench rooms and ate to our heart's content.  It's simple, expected , and friendly enough to make you want to give them more business."}
{"text":"This was a great way to have our birthday dinner !!what a show!!! This is for sure a don't judge a book by its cover!!"}
{"text":"Every time we come to vegas we come to osaka... it's defenetly the best sushi you can ever have."}
{"text":"When in Vegas recently for a business conference, my sales reps chose this place for dinner after hearing the rave reviews of how Osaka came highly recommended.  I was up for Japanese cuisine and something different from all the flashy tourist places on the strip.  The restaurant is definitely low key, casual and with no glitz whatsoever.  In fact, it looked pretty run down but definitely a favorite and popular place with the locals.  We requested a Japanese table that involved taking off your shoes and sitting down on cushions.  It was pretty run down and when seated and hanging my bare feet down under the table onto the old carpet, I couldn't help but wonder about the numerous pairs of bare feet that touched this very spot prior to me.  Perhaps my 3 stars is due to not being a seafood or fish lover.  I stuck to a teriyaki chicken and steak combo that was dry and just meh.  Rest of my party ordered various fish dishes that were okay but not exceptional.  I also ordered a California maki that came cold and didn't taste freshly made.  The plus, this place was pretty inexpensive verses restaurants on the strip.  It's good to see Osaka has a loyal following and good business.  Service was good too.  Perhaps just a place that wasn't for me."}
{"text":"The bam poppers we had on Wednesday were great along with the spicy tuna rolls and fried rice.  I also recommend the Japanese sandwich."}
{"text":"Okay, first off this place is my go-to sushi restaurant. I absolutely love this place, but today just wasn't that day. We walked in got seated with no probably, if you ever been to Osaka there are these tatami rooms and there is this one table where you are in a corner and there is a wall where nobody can see you and so unfortunately we got seated there. We sat down and usually you get water within the minute you've been there but no, we didn't cuz we were in the corner. 10 minutes pass by and still no water... nobody has yet acknowledged that we are there. So I stepped out and physically walked to an employee and asked can we please get a waiter and she said yeah yeah of course, so I sat back down and again waited another 10 minutes... so no water or anything. So we decided to just leave and go somewhere else. When we walked out no one even notice that we were leaving, they were too busy talking! & did I tell you that there were no business, there were only 3 tables so they weren't even busy! I'm not gonna say don't come here because I absolutely love this place. Maybe they were just having a rough day."}
{"text":"Osaka is simply the best locals sushi restaurant in Las Vegas. They are always consistent. The fish is fresh and I have never had a bad meal. Do not compare this place or its prices with an all you can eat joint."}
{"text":"Went here with friends because I wanted sushi & my friend from the wretched said Osaka was having some great deal. Well that great deal was only for the westside location so overpriced for what we ordered. I had one sushi roll which was ok but no better than nearby places without teppan that charge less. Two of them said their meal was good, but considered fair by the person who granted is the pickiest & also was paying the bill."}
{"text":"Great food and the service is always GREAT, however it is a bit pricey. Maybe not the best place for kids"}
{"text":"Normally I would never give one star, but this place justifies it! I have been in Vegas for over 20 years, been to this and the Summerlin Osaka several times - however this experience was horrible! First, with how old this place is and how much they charge, update your business! When you walk in, the other review that says this place is like a crack house is very correct! That is the only way to describe the experience when you walk in. Further, nothing has been updated since this place opened ... even the bathroom, with the overflowing dirty toilet!  Now on to the service, very rude and a \"no-it-all\" with zero customer service skills.  We went in because of the sign that said \"Late Night Specials\" - I called and was told many of the rolls were very discounted. The truth is, they are half rolls! AND if you ordered a whole roll off of the main menu, it would have been cheaper then two half rolls. Do you think because it is late night in Vegas, people will eat less, so it is a deal? If you order a half roll from the late night specials, you save an average of $.25. Really? This is your draw to get people in? Very deceptive. The quality of the food was OK, nothing amazing - and not even sure if what we got was what we ordered. Also, do not expect a refill on your water or tea or beer for that matter.   So many better late night places in Vegas that actually wants repeat business."}
{"text":"I LOVE Osaka because they have excellent quality fish - some of the freshest I've had.  I work at a high-end Sushi Restaurant on the strip, so I'm *really* picky about my sushi.  This is one of the only places I can still go and feel like I'm getting the quality I expect, along with some creativity as well.  Try the Sapo roll - it's fresh, simple, and delish!  The Sake List is pretty damn good, their late night menu has great variety and prices, and the service is attentive and knowledgeable, too!  This is where I go when I get off work and I want sushi.  I'm treated with open arms, but they don't hover over me and try to talk to me all night.  And the sushi chefs don't get plastered while preparing the food like a few of the other small sushi joints around.  They have fun, but are professional.  Very few locals places can even begin to compare. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Came to Osaka, waited at the front of the place to be seated no one came up to us for over 10 minutes, we were just standing there awkwardly and hungry and finally someone came to seat us, I don't think the front desk is ran good, or at least at the time we came in. I ordered some sushi it was pretty good, the prices were in the higher side, the food was pretty good though and the waitress was nice."}
{"text":"Sushi was great, I had the Bonzai, the sauce was amazing, however the staff was a bit standoffish and the tea was terrible, I've also never been charged for tea before, so that was new, other than that i really liked it. I might go back, if only for the amazing Bomba dessert i got,"}
{"text":"Very good sushi. It is extremely delicious. I remember eating here with my parents and the service was top notch."}
{"text":"I just love all of it. AND they have brown rice. AND they're open late at night. AND they're on my way home, so when I'm on my way from work, and it's late at night, I can call and order something fun and delicious to pick up. Yay!"}
{"text":"I happened to catch Diners, Drive ins and dives on Food Network the other evening and they featured Osaka Japanese Bistro.  Being new to Vegas, we depend on Yelp for restaurant recommendations.   Naturally, I pulled Osaka on Yelp and the reviews were not bad so my husband and decided to eat here on Sunday.   It was around 1:30 when we pulled up and we were able to find a parking space. Warning, the parking lot is very small.  We opened the door and literally hit a wall.  You can either go right or left to enter the restaurant but there was no sign on why there were 2 different entrances.  Odd but we decided to make a right and enter another set of doors.  You run into a dining room with a sushi bar on the right.  I'm assuming the hostess station is in the middle of the restaurant but not sure.  Just a very strange layout for first timers.   We sat at a table and waited for our waiter.  After 10 minutes, our waiter asked if anyone has taken our drink order which we replied no.  He promptly took our drink order while we viewed the menu.  We took advantage of the lunch menu and their special.  From the lunch menu we ordered: Kamikaze and Tiger rolls in addition to beef yakisoba.  From the daily special menu we ordered the King Crab roll.   The rolls were ok.  On both the Kamikaze and Tiger the sauce was very salty.  Yakisoba was very good.  The beef was really tender.  The king crab roll was nothing special.  Overall. Glad we tried it but will try other sushi restaurants."}
{"text":"Finished up date night with the GF at OJB.  I had made dinner reservation earlier in the week.  But I don't think reservations would have been an issue.  Things seemed pretty mellow at 9:00 in the evening.  While waiting to be seated I noticed a jazz singer in the bar area.  Cool sounds and would have loved to kick back and listen for a bit but we were starving.  We had a Teppanyaki table all to our selves.  While waiting for the chief we at a delicious roll called a \"Japanese Sandwhich\" which was similar to a \"Japanese Lasagna\" just not as messy.  We each  went with the fillet minion but the GF ordered the lobster and I the sea bass.  Our chief was very nice and got down to business. We did not need the culinary ninja performance and perhaps he sensed that.  He did the basic stuff but focused on getting our chow out and plated quickly.  Damn tasty was everything!  We particularly liked the sea bass of which I wanted to devour on my own but gladly shared with GF.  Osaka was a nice change up and very pleasurable experience."}
{"text":"I love this place!! One of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas! I have been coming here for years! I bring all my visitors, friends and family members to this place! I love that they have traditional booths (you have to take your shoes off) and they have tables, a bar, or a hibachi grill. I prefer the booth. My favorite desert is the tempura ice cream with chocolate drizzle and whip cream on top!"}
{"text":"I happen visit here by the search on the GPS. They open until 02:00am and have nice TaTami Table. Selection of apertizers and main Japanese foods are wide in addition to good sushi. It is satisfactable even by Japanese guests. The variety of Sushi is so wide and we could enjoy Aji, oh-toro, and chu-toro, etc, Impressive was fried rice that is exactly same to the one we can have in Japan. Although the most of the guests are Americans, I recommend here to Japanese peoples,"}
{"text":"Service was excellent. Husband got two rolls, a kamikaze and caterpillar. He said they were at least a 4/5. I had the teriyaki chicken meal and it was just the right amount of food with wonderful flavor. We will definitely be back when his sushi craving hits."}
{"text":"Great value with a huge menu and quality food.  The lunch specials that are offered everyday and at a very generous time widow are a big bonus."}
{"text":"Mmmm sweet Osaka. They have some of the best sushi you can get in Las Vegas. As noted by another user the entrance looks like a crack house. They have traditional Japanese seating where you kneel and take your shoes off."}
{"text":"The food was amazing!! I had the ramen combination. I picked spicy tuna roll and tonkustu flavor. The order came with a salad, the rolls, ramen and a salad. The gyoza was really crispy. The best I had!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I wanted some late-night sushi on a weekday. We were on the strip, but couldn't find anything open past 10pm. One of the door guys at Bally's suggested it so we grabbed a cab. It's a bit off the the strip, but I'd probably walk across the country for sushi. We sat at the sushi bar, which was pretty dead (as was the rest of the place, it was like 11pm on Tuesday). We ordered a handful of rolls, all super delicious! The Chef was making unique rolls, not on the menu, which is always fun! Bill was pretty cheap for all the food we ate. All and all, it was pretty good. Only negative would be the distance from the strip to the place, but well worth the cab fare!"}
{"text":"Took forever for a host to come. Host was rude and did not have any customer service skills"}
{"text":"First time here. Nice place. No Japanese on the sushi counter. Not good. Ordered. Two combination dinners, ordered saba, salmon skin salad, two std. sushi. We were hungry and I wanted to try the sushi. First the waiter was not personable, I really think he wasn't trained as a waiter, no smile, put our dishes on the outer edge of the table. Strange. The other waiters were ok, They smiled and had eye contact, 1. Sushi was small,the rice had no flavor . the fresh fish was to small . 2. Saba was ok 3. salmon skin salad, salmon didn't have to much taste, veggie wasn't fresh , dressing was weak, 4. tonkasu was only ok, tempura was good, 5, sukiyaki was tasty. I have mixed feelings about this place. I went with a friend and she enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Allen and Rudy took such great care of us!!! Rudy was so personable and a joy to be around. Food was amazing too!!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Osaka for years and the one thing others mentioned that I completely agree with is...  You always know what you're going to get.  I absolutely love their rolls, I love that they're open til 2 am (because I usually crave sushi during half-off roll time anyway).  I cannot find a place with better Japanese Lasagne. Seriously. It's always good and never cold.  My favorite roll in the whole entire world seems to be the Matsui #55 roll. I'm addicted to banzai sauce thanks to this roll. Also, the Ace Roll is interesting, I love the flavor.  Even the basic rolls are unbeatable. They are always fresh.  However, it is a little expensive.  I actually went here around midnight for my 21st birthday and they were so nice. I sat at the sushi bar, the sushi chef talked with me the whole time. He used to be a bartender, and obviously at midnight the bartender is gone. So he left the sushi bar after asking me what I wanted and he came back with a washington apple martini. He told the waitress to be nice. She came back with hot sake and Sapporo beer, and he ended up drinking with me all night!  It was hilarious, and they made the night even better.  Everything I've ever had at Osaka has been great. It's also nice to see a place have fantastic desserts not consisting of only mochi, green tea/tempura ice cream."}
{"text":"Osaka is, hands down, my favorite sushi restaurant in Las Vegas (and in the last 10 years, we have frequented quite a few). They have excellent fish (top quality, all the time), reasonable prices, and a smaller, quiet sushi bar that is very easy to enjoy a meal at with your family. They also have a dining room with tables, and tatami rooms in the back, where I would personally love to go for a birthday dinner. It's about 10-15 minutes off the strip, and in my opinion totally worth it whether you're a local or in town for vacation.   One of the best bonuses about Osaka is their hours- they are open for lunch and super late (until 2:00 am!!!).   Some ordering recommendations-  - My number one recommendation is simply for the nigiri sushi. I personally have never had a bad experience with their sake or hamachi, and when they say the uni is good, it's really good! I also like their regular-old spicy tuna roll.  - Our family's go-to rolls generally include the O.G. Special (crispy rice with spicy tuna and yummy sauce + sriracha on top) and Kai's Special roll. Both are always hits with visitors too.  - From the kitchen, I personally like the Osaka Rice (sushi rice, masago, crab, sauce). Our family is split between the empura soft shell crab with ponzu sauce and the soft shell katsu with screaming sauce- both are a great appetizer to split."}
{"text":"Went to celebrate our daughter's birthday. Had a table of 11. I've been to MANY teppanyaki restaurants before and this was the most ridiculous set up I've ever been too. If my daughter wouldn't have been crushed on site I would have walked out.   They set a grill and table around a retaining wall!! Our party couldn't even see each other from one end of the table to the other. We were the first ones there and this was the only place they would put us. Which didn't make sense. Sorry I didn't take a photo. We were squished into the back corner too and it was just not comfortable. Even our chef had to go around the retaining wall to see my son to give him his food. I chose this place based on the Yelp reviews since we were visiting the Vegas area, but no one mentioned the horrible seating.  I did hear they moved it from one side of restaurant to other? But not sure if that is true or not.   I decided to still give 3 stars because the chef (Daniel) was fantastic and our waiter was good at first but I think he was the only one there working so he was spread thin.   So to recap- food decent, service good enough, but seating horrendous, should be check out by fire marshall actually!  Won't go back again."}
{"text":"Great food!  I meet a client there every month.  Its one of my favorite places to eat here in Las Vegas.  Ramon is so delicious if your in to Japanese food."}
{"text":"Osaka was a great experience for the family and I tonight! Our chef Zack -aka- White Boy! He was awesome on the grill tonight! He did a excellent job keeping us entertained! If you want to enjoy your time at Osaka, you should definitely ask for him! He is only 19, and he is a great cook!!"}
{"text":"This review is long overdue. I've been coming to Osaka on Sahara for the last 20 years. The quality of the fish is consistent, the service is exemplary. When you have sushi chefs like Kenji, Jaime and Oscar you can't go wrong. They have a good variety of sake, and Asahi draft from Japan. This is a great venue, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Since there's a lot of sushi/Japanese restaurants to choose from in the valley, why not go to one that's closest to authenticity and has been established for quite sometime?  In my opinion, I think this place is pretty much the OG of Japanese restaurants in the Valley and that the other Japanese restaurants try to imitate Osaka. Every time I come here, service from the hostess, to the busser, server, chefs are all real nice. Service might be a bit slow at times but that's compensated with their food.  There's a lot to choose from in their menu, prices are comparable and I'd say overall quality is between \"good\" and \"best.\"   You must try the Tempura Bam; I don't think I've ever had tempura shrimp prepared this way anywhere.   The tofu is decent; The sauce was a little too ginger tasting for my taste but I would order this again. (just don't expect their tofu to be like Rakus...:P)  The okonomiyaki is alright; I thought there was too much scallops for my taste and I wasn't a big fan of the sauce they used--it was on the sweeter side.   They don't oversaturate their teriyaki dishes with sauce and their sauce isn't that nasty, sticky sweet either.   Lastly, their fish. Their fish is real tasty; one of the freshest in the valley. Their ama ebi is so so good; it's plump and tastes as if it came right out of the sea. One of the sushi chef's introduced my fiance and me to their white tuna....and now I crave it because their white tuna is so fresh, and buttery. They prepare their rolls well; they don't over stuff their rolls with rice like other places do. There isn't a roll that particularly stands out to me because they're all pretty much freakin' awesome.   Another nice touch to the Eastern location is how you might get the chance to hear a pianist play in their restaurant! :) Music here seriously makes this Japanese restaurant stand out from the rest since a lot of them either don't play music or just play top 40 crap on a digital radio station. If you can't already tell, Osaka is definitely one of my go-to sushi/Japanese restaurants in the Valley."}
{"text":"Don't let the semi-ghetto, run down exterior deter you from giving this place a try; you'll be delighted to come inside and be able to enjoy Osaka's wonderful menu.  I believe this location has a better happy hour menu than the one in Anthem. Last time I came here, their happy hour started at either 10p or 11p. Now that I think of it, I think this location is the only location with a happy hour menu....  Anyway, my thoughts on the food here can be found on my review of their Anthem location. I will say, their service here is hit or miss and is inconsistent, which I find irritating sometimes.  Kampai to Osaka's top notch menu and cuisine! :)"}
{"text":"This is one of those restaurants that keeps amazing me with new creativity and variety of fresh fish. The staff is nothing short of amazing, and after eating here many times they now welcome myself and family by name. There's not much I haven't tried including the delicacy unagi sushi, some favorites are the garlic tuna prepared with a lightly spiced citrus sauce, the butter salmon, salmon skin hand roll and when in season needle fish is to die for. Come to find out the owner is an amazing fisherman and takes pride in everything that he serves his guests. Both Henderson and the sahara location are amazing, avoid the summerlin location though, it's not owned by the same person though they are relatives and the quality is lacking unfortunately. For an amazing dessert try the Oreo tempura fried ice cream!"}
{"text":"Heard about this tasty place ... I will definitely return again and again for the freshness of the sushi. The monkfish liver is far out! And those scallops... yum!  Fresh as Fresh can be in this Japanese restaurant. So authentic, sit on the floor cushions and enjoy the experience. Thank you for the great meals."}
{"text":"There are currently three Osaka locations in Las Vegas as I write this. The first Osaka I ever visited was years ago near my house on Lake Mead/Rainbow which offered terrific service, great atmosphere and great sushi. However, I went back and that location changed. But this is the REVIEW for Osaka on Eastern now, so here we go.   After a hard day of work we (8 people) went to Osaka's with reservations and were promptly seated at one of those tables (forgive my ignorance) where you take your shoes off and your legs hang under. Within seconds of ordering drinks they were already out and we were pouring Sapporo for everyone and a Tokyo Tea for one of the girls at the table.   We ordered a couple of appetizers, cooked dishes and sushi. More than enough food for the table! Everyone raved about how good the food was I tried everything. One of the rolls NOT on their menu is the virgin roll, make sure you give it a try. The sushi was very fresh, flown in that morning.  We ended the night with green tea ice cream ;)"}
{"text":"Fresh, Yummy Sushi!  big portions, fast customer service.  The green tea is authentic and the miso soup has plenty of sea weed!  Favorite rolls - spicy tuna and volcano roll.  Parking is plenty - at night it's busy, but plenty of street parking.   Enjoy !"}
{"text":"I've been here before I moved to Vegas about 3 years ago and liked it so we returned for a birthday dinner. As you open the door you're greeted by a wall and a slightly off putting smell. Still I'm here and hungry, we're doing this! We were seated in the traditional Japanese table and our waiter was friendly. We ordered the yellowtail collar, miso sea bass, sashimi plate, and I LOT of salmon nigiri. Our waiter offered to upgrade the the salmon to \"butter salmon\" for .95 an order more, and yes I want the best RAW fish so we upgraded. Water and tea were refilled promptly and endlessly but our waiter kinda disappeared and left us hanging on who to order more food with. I wish he had just given us a quick heads up, especially since we had hungry kids wanting more of that salmon. All told it was an ok experience. The lack of stars attributed to the fact that if I have to upgrade my salmon you should get rid of the lower quality salmon and serve the best as a sushi place should. Also, the bathroom really smelled, like into the hallway sewage smell. This place has been around since 1967 and is in need of some upgrades. I'll be looking for a better fit for my next sushi dinner out."}
{"text":"Happy hour yum!!! I love half rolls so you can try Twice as many.  The White tiger was our new choice thus time and it was delicious with seared tuna in it.  Then finished with the staple Bonzi roll, a crunchy, sweet, slightly spicy roll."}
{"text":"I've probably been here at least two dozen times. I LOVE this restaurant, and have been coming here for years. My go to is the teriyaki chicken and shrimp tempura lunch special. It comes with insane amounts of food, including rice, a small salad, and soup. The sushi is also really great, super fresh, and made very quickly.   The atmosphere is obviously a huge plus, as they have the Japanese floor tables and comfortable mats to sit on, as well as table seating.   The food always comes out quickly, the servers are friendly and knowledgeable, and I've never had any incorrect orders, food I didn't love, or any other reason to discourage others from going.   Also, it should be noted that it's far superior to the Osaka on Sahara, which is significantly worse and not worth the trip, at all."}
{"text":"Delicious rolls! My favorite is the \"Oh! Kamisama\". My boyfriend and I keep coming back, we love Osakas!"}
{"text":"So good.  Very small place, not much for ambiance, but all of the food was super fresh and perfectly made.  The garlic edamame was unique and very good.  I've never had O Toro before, and I ordered it twice again after the first round. Also had the same sampler was a great addition.  Our server was nice, knowledgeable, and personable.    Overall highly recommended."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for about 5 years now and everything is amazing every single time! From the drinks, the sushi, the dessert and the customer service!"}
{"text":"On a recent trip to Vegas we hit this place up on Valentines Day for dinner. We called ahead of time and they gave us one of the sunken tables, and we were on our way! Walking in is disconcerting seeing a plain door, then a blank wall to walk around into the actual restaurant. I loved the sunken tables, I loved the traditional aspect of removing your shoes to dine, and the service was superb despite it being a holiday.  The food was great. GREAT. I had an order of pan-fried gyoza, tried the seaweed salad YUM! I ordered a half order of Tekka Maki, half order of a philly roll to play it safe, and tried the 777 roll to be adventurous. I was not disappointed!!! It did take a couple times of my asking to get my beer, but it was absolutely SLAMMED and the poor waitress was attentive but obviously frazzled and very busy.  They get 4 stars instead of 5 because despite us writing down our names and the dollar mount to charge on our split check, I ended up being charged someone's else's tab so my $30 meal is currently costing me $100 in \"pending\" authorizations. An inconvenience, but mistakes happen."}
{"text":"My mom found this and we live in LA. The best Japanese food in Vegas. Yes, don't judge it by the outside or the entry way.  But once you get in, it is just like any other restaurant.   We sat in the tatami room where you take off your shoes sit on the ground around the table. There is actually space to put your feet.  The food is great. Sushi, tempura, boats, udon, or even great appetizers, if you want.  And desserts too!  Would recommend this place to anyone and everyone who wants great Japanese food."}
{"text":"I love Osaka. I've always had positive experiences here. The food is great, atmosphere is awesome and the customer service is suburb. Tonight was a different story. Prior to ordering, a person sitting next to me (by the grill) had a cockroach crawling on her arm from off of the table. After this, I will NEVER EVER eat here again. Unbelievable."}
{"text":"Hmmm. Well, I must say the presentation is some of the best I've ever seen; however, the slices of various Sashimi (Small Plate = $45) were not as thick as I'm accustomed to. Wonderful flavors in every dish we ordered, but portions are on the small side. Being charged for green tea and rice are also not the norm for me, either. All told, that may be the deal-breaker."}
{"text":"Wow, I can't believe this place has 4 stars! I wasn't impressed at ALL! I came here for a bday dinner for a friend, and the place was already chosen, or else I would have suggested someplace different. It doesn't look very inviting.   We were there on a Thurs. night around 8 and were ushered into the back where the teppan tables are. For one, our table was right next to the kitchen door, which was distracting, and it wasn't busy so we could have been seated elsewhere. The atmosphere was shabby - maybe it was because of where we were seated (other parts of the restaurant looked like they may have been nicer) - not very warm or upkept. It seemed like it had been a while since they decorated. Just.. kind of shabby.   Anyway, we ordered some drinks, then three of the four of us ordered meals from the teppan-dinner menu, and the fourth ordered from the sushi menu. Our drinks came at a decent time, except for one of my friends, who later actually had to remind the waiter about it - turns out the waiter forgot. Speaking of the waiter: he was a very nice man, but he kept butting into our conversations! I think it was his way of giving \"good customer service\" but it got a little awkward after a while, when he kept adding little tidbits and comments to what we were saying.   We actually had some friends that would be joining us later in the evening, but the waiter made sure to tell us that the chef only cooked at the teppan once per table. That's understandable. My friend who ordered from the sushi menu got his food before the tepan chef even came out for our orders, which I thought was a little uncoordinated. Again - it wasn't busy at all. There was only one other teppan table with people and they were on dessert.   Our chef comes out of no where. He's not pushing a cart because the cart has been sitting by our table the entire time, as if they had just left it after the last \"presentation.\" I get that it may be more convenient, but c'mon. It looks bad, and also doesn't imply \"freshness.\" (He did bring the meats and main ingredients out fresh, the cart had the sauces and butter and stuff). So our chef comes out, doesn't introduce himself or anything, just starts cooking. I've been to a teppan-style restaurant before that does this \"presentation,\" but for my friend who hadn't, he didn't even know there was going to be a show! He just thought the guy was cooking in front of us.   Our chef, while nice, was nervous and messed up about every 4-5 tricks that he did. I was kind of embarrassed for him, but I know he did his best. To be honest, though, because of his lack of being personable, it was kind of awkward to sit there and have a conversation while this guy is just doing random tricks at the table. It wasn't engaging enough for us to actually pay attention to him. Osaka didn't deliver on this experience at ALL. The worst part was that this guy's manager (I assume) was watching the whole time, which was even making us uncomfortable.  The food was just okay. Nothing I remember, and honestly, better Japanese food can be found elsewhere for much, much cheaper. After we finished eating, we were hanging around waiting for our other friends to show up, and it took them a long time to clear our plates. The chef came out about a half hour after we finished eating to clean the teppan; didn't say a word again.   Luckily, we had a gift card so we didn't end up paying much after it was applied, because I would have regretted spending anymore than I did. It is way overpriced for what you get (it may have been a different story if we actually got the experience we were hoping for). It is cheaper than Benihana but it is NOT worth the discount. If you want a great teppan-dining experience, splurge and go to Benihana. Everything there is miles better. Don't bother with this place if you're going for that."}
{"text":"When I first arrived I was hesitant, only based on my inexperience with sushi honestly. I wasn't very familiar and I was worried - what I got was extremely fresh and delicious! I had the sake nigiri, Philadelphia and the roll from Triple D  (not sure of the name..). All was great and I would highly recommend. If your in vegas only for the tourism piece, this is not near anything, but worth a quick Uber ride over."}
{"text":"Good Food. Strange Service.  Ok when we walked in it was 2 pm not a optimal time..  We asked for hibachi.  They told us it was closed.  I could see people sitting so i was confused.  they sat us at a table and gave us sushi menus.  I ask the waitress(new person) for real menus since we wanted hibachi.  She got us up from the table and said its open did we want to go there...  we all looked at each other like oman worried...  these folks need to work on service bad.  The hibachi shrimp and chicken with fried rice was good..  I would look for a more together place."}
{"text":"A colleague took us here for dinner, being one of his favorites when in town.  I let them order and everything was fantastic. We sat in the area with the traditional tables which was fun. The people were very friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"Love their spicy edamame, a great twist on a classic sushi appetizer. All their food always tastes really fresh. The service is hit or miss, sometimes great and sometimes lack luster. Also like that they are open late."}
{"text":"If I could give this place no stars, I would. We placed an order online under the impression that we were paying $60 for 4 rolls. What we got instead was 16 pieces. DON'T BUY FROM THEM. They will rip you off. When we called to complain, the manager, Dave, was rude, unsympathetic that their website was misleading, and tried to blame the delivery company for making the order wrong. Talk about misplaced blame and unaccountability. Horrible business and even worse customer service."}
{"text":"I get the veggie sushi and they are the best place in town for non fish sushi. Very creative rolls.  Great service, very authentic atmosphere. They always remember me and how I like things, which is great.  I am loyal to them 100%."}
{"text":"Been her since 6pm, on time, and Teppanyaki chef didn't start till a little after 7 pm. Unacceptable! We come here a lot and this experience has been not up to par. Plan to be here at least 2-3 hours for Teppanyaki. Do not go on Mondays"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I never write reviews. Ever. Last night we had reservations for a party of 14 at 8 p.m. our server was very nice. But drinks took 30 minutes. We didn't even see the chef until 9:40. Only 1 chef was on staff. So part of our party was left out of the experience. With his back to them. We finally get to eat around 10 pm. Mid meal the chef comes out with soapy water to start cleaning the grill. We asked if he could wait until we were done eating. He replied with \"but I'm done now\". And continued to clean we asked again that he please wait until we were finished eating, he actually told one of us \"you shut up\". But stopped cleaning.he then said again \"but I'm done it's after closing\" we would have gladly eaten before 10 if it hasn't taken 2 hours to get our food. We then asked for a manager, we were told the manager is off for the holiday. Our server was polite. But it was apparent that staffing was an issue if the manager wasn't even there. It's not fair to your guests to receive this type of service. Nor is it fair to your wait staff who should be able to enjoy their jobs. Another server helped with our checks, so the team work was apparent. But the chef who gave us dirty looks as he stomped off and the lack of management was a huge let down for out party celebrating a birthday. Abd I'm only giving 1 star because it doesn't allow us to leave zero stars. Again, our server was polite, nice and sweet. But he lacked the support that he needed in terns of a chef and a manager."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a great atmosphere - especially the tables where you sit in rooms by yourself. And the service is awesome. The food is average. I was expecting it to be incredible since it was a DDD (Guy Fuery) but it just wasn't. The spring rolls were good but a little mushy. The dipping sauce was great. The California roll was good. The chicken noodle soup had an odd taste to it. The tempera was ok - a bit heavy with oil. All in all it's worth going and a nice restaurant with good prices."}
{"text":"Sushi here is beyond awesome, on the other hand the service is beyond horrible!!!  I think I saw my server 2x.   After being sat at our table, our server came by after 15minutes.   Our food.... Took over 25 minutes to get soup... Then another 45 minutes to get sushi.... Half of our table got to eat.   The other half had to wait another 30 minutes to get their food.   Saw our waiter again for our bill. Like I said sushi was bomb, but the slow service totally blew it.  For the price we paid, it was not worth it. I definitely will not be back."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious!! I am pretty picky with my sushi, but I am a satisfied customer! The Unagi roll was perfection, the California roll was good, but the NZ baked mussel was what took this place over the top!! I would go back for that and I live in Hawaii :) Great service, nice, small place."}
{"text":"They wouldn't give my daughter a place at our table.  My husband, almost 1 year old daughter, and I went to eat dinner at the teppanyaki table.  We got there at about 5:20, without a reservation.  The hostess went to seat someone else and so my husband went to use the restroom.  The manager came over and asked if I'd been helped.  I said no and that there were three of us.  She said she had to wait until we were all here to seat us.  I said my husband was in the restroom.  She refused to seat us until he got done.  This already put a bad taste in our mouths.  Next, they seated us at the short end of the table with my daughter's highchair not at the table as the rest of the table was occupied.  We noted another grill across from us with only 4 people who had just been seated.  We asked our waitress if we could be moved so that my daughter could be at the table with us since she doesn't have the ability to eat in her lap.  The waitress said she'd ask if that was okay.  The manager said no as those spots were reserved.  We said we're going to go ahead and leave since our daughter needs a place to eat and she said \"okay, bye\".   The only redeeming part of the evening was, once the other customers at our table realized the situation, they all moved down and made room for my daughter (even though it meant everyone was squished).  They were so nice we ended up staying and eating our \"just okay\" dinner (it's been a while but we remembered the food as being much better in the past).  The \"people\" who reserved the other seats at the table across from us never showed.    This used to be one of our favorite nights out, pre-baby, however the lack of accommodation means it's not a place we'll go to in the future."}
{"text":"I took my family here with my partner on Black Friday (his birthday) for lunch.  Not a single thing was out of place.  I give one solid star for service (I would give two stars but this only goes up to five and I need the other stars for the rest).  Our waiter was on top of it, full of humor and personality, and when we were too full to order dessert, he still brought us out a triad of ice cream to share with spoons and a candle as a birthday treat for my partner.   One star for the atmosphere.  The music isn't too loud, there are tatami rooms with ample room, and the décor is very simple and late traditional.  One star for the price and portion sizes.  We were very happy with the lunch prices, the bento box had plenty of food (I couldn't finish my rice), and there is Asahi on draft, which I highly recommend over the bottled.  Two stars for the food and the fact that I will most definitely be coming back!  We got both types of oyster appetizers that are raw, and it was a tie for which tasted best between the four of us.  But all were delicious.  I had the grilled saba in my bento.  The portion looked small and not like much, but the flavor and texture were a wonderful delight and I did not encounter a single bone, which never happens with saba!  The tempura was lightly battered and the vegetables were fitting (sweet potato and carrot, etc).  Everyone loved the house made salad dressing.  It was light and refreshing, as was the seaweed salad I had with my bento.  I ordered tonkatsu for my partner and it was of a great texture and not too thick, or too thin and dry.  It was very light in texture and fried to a perfect golden brown throughout.  The soup appetizer was not miso, but more a teppanyaki restaurant soup more predominant with broth, but was surprising to have a small amount of noodles in it, which we were all pleased with.   Osaka, thank you very much for a wonderful time while my family was here on my partner's birthday!!!  ^_^"}
{"text":"WOW! If I could give this place 10 STARS I would. It is that good.  I ordered Kai's Special sushi roll and it just melted in my mouth.  Service was down to earth and spot on.  Don't be turned away from the diversity of nationalities behind the counter.  Easily a MUST STOP for all Japanese enthusiasts, and if you don't, you loose out big.  May seem expensive, but hear, you get what you pay for.  Like a taste of heaven."}
{"text":"Love love love everything. Sake, food, service  Taking shoes off and seating on pillows gives me the whole oriental experience.   Great late night menu as well."}
{"text":"I've gone to Osaka for the 6 years and every time gets better and better, sushi chefs John, Julio, and Armando have been always great   Shout out to the best sushi and cold beer in Henderson"}
{"text":"3.5.  I think the rolls are average, the albacore sashimi was fresh, their yakitori were good, and the sauce that covered it was tasty.  They have a bunch of sushi during happy hour but they're only 4 pieces per order which isn't really a good deal.  I don't think I'll be back as the prices don't warrant the overall quality."}
{"text":"Before my boyfriend and I moved to Las Vegas permanently we always wanted to find a good steak and sushi spot. My best friends husband suggested Osaka so we tried it and we are so glad we did. The service was amazing as well as the suggested rolls by our waiter. We had the best experience at this particular location. I believe our servers name was Carlos (not too sure) thank you for the amazing experience. We will definitely return and bring more friends and family."}
{"text":"They just have c rated from the city.it is expansive than before.long time eater here."}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed with this sushi Restaraunt for the past 15 years and I think there food is as good or better that any hotel for half the price. It's only 5 min from the strip and make sure you go to this one its the original location and far better than the other ones."}
{"text":"Always excellent! The sushi is always fresh. Are usually get delivery and they are always early and always friendly! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful sushi. The 1-star and 2-star reviews have absolutely no clue about real sushi. This place doesn't cater to california styles ... it serves some but its strength is traditional plates and -real- sake (the kind that is still cloudy and you -want- to drink with your meal not just sip).   The only reason I didn't give 5-stars was due to the out of the way location and tiny frontage. But in a town like Vegas that can be a bonus, too."}
{"text":"Since Raku was closed for the first couple days of the New Year, we had to search for another new place to eat. We found Osaka Japanese Bistro.  First of all, there's some history to this place.  It's been around for over 40 years so you have to assume they know what they're doing.  It's also in a slightly shady part of town where only locals should go or those who are lost searching for Ichiza find themselves.  We started off with some sushi rolls and sashimi.  Meh.  I've had fresher sashimi and better tasting roll combinations.  Although, I did like the fact Osaka offered half orders on most of their rolls.  The entree we ordered was a little better.  We ordered the John's Special and had a good time to sharing.  Tempura was battered a little heavier than I'm use to but the chicken and beef teriyaki had a good flavor.  The dessert was surprisingly good.  We had the green tea tiramisu (I know it's a traditional Italian dessert but doesn't it just sound Japanese?).  I would have never have guessed that the flavors of mascarpone and green tea would marry so well.  It was pricey but worth the experience.  Overall, I'd be willing to go back for late night eats, desserts, and drinks but will have to pass on having dinner here again."}
{"text":"Flying into Vegas on Southwest Airlines, I watched an episode of Triple \"D\" showcasing Osaka Japanese Bistro.  So, we had to go there.  WOW.  The craftmanship, authinticity and amazing skill with every plate was amazing.  You will not leave this place without a smile on your face.  You will enjoy.  #Awesome."}
{"text":"Had the best birthday dinner in a long time here. Also was the first time I had tried sushi before and it was amazing. My brother suggested this and now it is my official sushi spot."}
{"text":"Went to Osaka's on a Wednesday evening. It was around 9:30 PM, kind of a late dinner so it wasn't too busy. The place was quaint, peaceful and the service was pretty good. I ordered the chicken katsu which wasn't anything out of the ordinary and a beer on top of that. The prices are decent, the staff is friendly. But I was kinda looking for the \"A-Ha\" factor here.. and it never showed up.  Overall, good experience, but if you're looking to be blown away.. I'd do a little bit more searching."}
{"text":"This place is great! It has dethroned ichiza in my book.  Its a lot bigger! There are at least 4 tatami rooms. The late night menu is insanely good. Service was attentive and the food was fabulous.  The rolls were huge! 10 pieces p/roll! I will be coming back next time I visit Vegas. This will be a regular go to spot."}
{"text":"Great food, awesome teppanyaki chef, but ridiculously unacceptable wait time despite making a reservation. I made a 5:30 reservation to host a birthday and the ONE chef on duty could not make it to our table until 6:50! Don't do this to your customers...it makes them not want to return. I would have left had it not been a birthday and involved so many other guests who made arrangements to be there. Wretched wait. Our Chef, Jon, was the best. I totally acknowledge his skill, humor, and entertainment...in essence, he saved the night for us there."}
{"text":"Exterior is unassuming, and you walk in to an immediate brick wall before entering the sushi bar. Very awkward. Japanese kitchen area is separate, did not go into it during my visit. Lunch menu til 4PM allowed me to score half-portion (and half-price) rolls for me and my guy, along with a salad and an app for around $40. Score!  Tuna poke salad ($8) was tasty, shrimp shumai ($5) was okay but didn't hit that craving-dim-sum spot that I hoped it would. Sushi was surprisingly good- fish was fresh, flavors were on point. BF and I were torn between picking favorites among the rolls: his was the WHITE TIGER (shrimp, takuan, avocado, cucumber, topped with lightly seared super white tuna, soy sauce, bansai sauce) while mine was the KAI'S SPECIL (eel, spicy tuna, avocado, cream cheese, eel sauce). The Cali roll was as expected, and the OH KAMISAMA was good too (shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, topped with seared salmon, tataki, banzai sauce).   Service was attentive up until our bill came- then our guy disappeared for a solid ten minutes for no apparent reason. We were the only patrons present in that part of the restaurant."}
{"text":"I honestly loved this place before. However,I get really mad about silly&rude service from waiter.  We sat in tatami and ordered 2 drinks. I waited my drink about 15mins and the waiter never shows up to bring my drink,and take order. It was slow on that night. He never come to my table even I called him. So I decided to go walk to him and ask where is my drink? And he answered me,'when you sit in tatami,you have to take off your shoes. I didn't bring your drinks cause you don't take off your shoes' WTF? Sorry to use bad word. But seriously. WTF. why don't you tell me when you let us sitting in tatami? If me,I will tell to customer when I bring drinks to them. You spent your 15mins to waiting us to take off the shoes? Wow I'm clapping to his patience!!  And who do you think you are? I thought he was my professor of Japanese culture! He was acting like I'm not giving you candy if you fail.   What a hilarious services I ever had in my life hahaha Btw food was so good!"}
{"text":"The menu is huge and covers any mood your taste buds are in...plus they have a great late night memu until 2 am! The food, especially the seafood...is so fresh and is highest quality. The service from all is wonderful...but kenji the sushi chef is phenomenal and really enhances the ecperience through great convos!"}
{"text":"WOW! After spending 6 years living in Japan and eating real Japanese food, this is THE closest we have come to it in the states! Food was cooked as ordered and the servings were plentiful and properly cut to size. Staff was super friendly and very attentive. Glass would go empty and BAM, it would be full. Menu was rather large with plenty of options and to satisfy even the pickiest appetite. Definitely worth visiting and next time we are in town I can guarantee you we will be going back! This reminded me of a small place we frequented weekly in Japan and brought back a lot of great memories with our Japanese friends. Oh and those of you who have been stationed on Okinawa, they have ORION!"}
{"text":"We found out about Osaka from friends who had been here a few months earlier.  They highly recommended this \"First Japanese Restaurant \" in Las Vegas.  We were equally impressed.  Not only was our entire meal delicious, the service was impeccable.  Would love to be a regular here."}
{"text":"We visited Osaka on the night before Thanksgiving as a part of our Vegas foodie vacation, based on their feature on Triple D.   Literally the best sushi we've ever had!    I have a weird self-imposed rule about eating fish so far from the ocean.  (Which I know is ridiculous - even living in San Diego, I know most of our seafood is not locally sourced!).  I broke my rule at Osaka, and I'm so very glad I did!  We decided to sit in a traditional Japanese booth, and were seated quickly, and our server was very attentive through our whole dinner.   The portions were generous and very reasonably priced.   Plus they allow you to order half rolls, so you can try lots of different combos!    We ordered the Osaka rice and several rolls...  Absolutely, hands down the Japanese Lasagna roll was one of the best bites of food I've ever had.  Not at all traditional, but so delicious with melted cream cheese on top...  I'll be dreaming about that roll for a while!   We also ordered the Roppongi, Oh Kamisama and Treasure Island at the recommendation of our server.  They were his favorites, and we really enjoyed them.   Then we went a little wild and ordered the Yum Yum, Pocket Aces, Fresh White, And Kai's Special.   We decided that the Fresh White was a little bland, but still better than any of the sushi we've had in California.     Overall, this was an outstanding experience and I'm glad we ventured off strip to try it.   Next time we'll likely sit at the grill, because all of the fish was so fresh and delicious, I have no doubt that the Kobe on the teppan grill is to die for!!"}
{"text":"Ate here for dinner with a friend around 8pm on Jan 13. Had some rolls and appetizers. Woke up at 2am violently throwing up. Woke up again at 5am throwing up. My friend was sick all night as well and this was the only meal we both ate. Still feeling sick.   Will never eat at Osaka again."}
{"text":"Amazing food, this is always the first stop when my out of state friends are in town. The only thing I would recommend is the waiter/waitresses being a little more attentive when we reach the end of out meal. Sometimes we wait 10 Minutes just to get a check and leave."}
{"text":"I have been going here for as long as I can remember and it has always been amazing! Delicious food and the show at the teppanyaki grill is great. Prices are fair for the amount of food and show that you get I highly recommend for birthdays or special events where you want to be entertained while eating! Will continue going here if they keep up everything the same they have since they opened!"}
{"text":"Was excited to go for a nice night out for Father's Day. Had 7:30pm reservations for the table cook. Arrived 10 mins early, 40 minutes later we were finally seated and the restaurant was not that busy. Once we finally sat at the cook top, we waited another 20 minutes before any order was taken. I ordered a few pieces of sushi and when it finally arrived, the pieces were very small, about half the size of normal servings, going back and reading other reviews, that seems to be a common comment. Thankfully the rest of the dinner service was good and entertaining so our evening wasn't totally ruined but due to their poor service quality, I can't recommend this location to anyone."}
{"text":"Food.  Ok.  Service. Ok.  Cleanliness.  Could be a lot better.   Restrooms have supplies stored under sinks and in sight.   No attention to detail."}
{"text":"Had a really great time at dinner today. Zak was entertaining and a great chef. So much food and very tasty. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"classic great atmosphere fresh yummy"}
{"text":"Very little place in the middle of nowhere  But great food and excellent service.  When you ask for filet mignon they give the real one no fat meat like other places.  Beer ichiban is excellent and good size   Great for couples group and families  I really recommend this place to my friend."}
{"text":"Great food, excellent service evertime im there. May you guys be blessed with many good tipping customers!!!"}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant for over 30 years.  I have always gotten excellent service.  My current favorite server is David.  The fresh tuna that my boyfriend eats is always fresh.  Their tempura udon soup is excellent.  I have never had a sushi roll there that I didn't enjoy.  One of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"This is probably almost my 10th time coming here.. It is awesome... Customer service is great and pleasant, the food comes out pretty fast, if you don't have a big party, lol.. Their food is DELICIOUS!!!!  The lighting and environment here is relaxing..  My family always comes here for family dinners.. loove the shirley temple drink wit the marichino cherries... :) their desserts are great. Haven't tried all of them. The deep fried ice cream, the deep fried bananas, one of the frozen fruit desserts. Can't remember the name.. But they give you the level of sweetness of the dessert.   Overall i love this place and so does my family!!! :)"}
{"text":"Always love eating here. Service is always prompt and portion sizes are decent. 911 rolls and the (tonkatsu) are my favorite.  Don't forget to end on some delicious tempura ice cream.   One thing I deducted a star for was due to them serving wild caught bluefin tuna. Unfortunately, the species is predicted to be extinct by 2012."}
{"text":"This is one of those hidden gems of Las Vegas.   We have been eating there for a few years now and have never been disappointed. We have always had terrific service and great food.  The tempura soft shell appetizer is huge and always delivers in taste.  A goofy name, but the sauce on the Sassy Roll is addicting.   The tuna is buttery and the teriyaki steak is mouth watering. I try one different thing each time I go along with my standards and some are hits and some miss. Not because they aren't prepared properly or freshness, only because it's not to my taste like the whole scallop. There is a reason seafood places only serve the meaty white part of the scallop.  It's probably a delicacy to some, but not for me.   All the rolls I've had have been excellent! Very consistent in service and quality.  We go early with our kids and they eat great and love sitting with their shoes off at the low tables.   Would recommend for anyone who likes good sushi moderately priced with excellent service."}
{"text":"we always have birthdays here, they have great food, i have tried probably half of the items on the menu, the sushi is great, and they servers know us. we love the late night hours, and the late night prices. try it out"}
{"text":"Its exterior looks like an unassuming hole-in-the-wall. We came for a late lunch with barely anyone around and sat up at the front with the sushi chef. We ordered a variety of sushi rolls, nigiri and sashimi. They all tasted very delicious and fresh. I hadn't tried uni since high school when I decided I didn't like it and I was shocked to find that the piece I tried that day was actually quite palatable to me. I guess guess my tastes of changed. I quite liked their mackerel and the overall variety that they offered for their fresh sushi bar. Very impressive and would likely try again.."}
{"text":"Japanese lasagna sushi..one word. Heaven!! The best I've ever had and no where else makes it the same believe me I always compare..it must be the sauce. Also a great place for late night sushi. Occasionally they play live music on a piano and it's a very atmosphere. Always suggest this place whenever anyone wants sushi but it's slightly pricey that's the only thing. Its quality and great service which I think is so worth it. Kid friendly but even more enjoyable on a date night.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Well many years ago this place was not so bad. Now the prices are outrageous and the food quality is very poor. I gave them a few chances as we do not have many other teppan restaurants in the area. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff. Host is a very nice Japanese guy.  I've been on a mission to find really good Katsu Curry ever since I came back from Japan a couple months ago and these guys have a version that's pretty close to what I would get at my favorite curry restaurant in Nagoya. I really wish they used a thicker cutlet like they do in Japan but, oh well... it's close enough for me not to whine about too much. The curry itself is really yummy, with chunks of tender beef instead of just the curry sauce. Not typical but definitely appreciated.  Next time, I'm going to try the Katsu Curry over at Miko's Izakaya and Ichiza. I've been going to these places for years now but I have never ordered Katsu Curry. I never even liked the stuff until I went to Nagoya and now I'm a little fixated. Bad news for my diet. Ugh."}
{"text":"The past couple times I have noticed new chefs.  Our server was very nice, attentive and always talked the boys into getting more sake. I frequent teppanyaki so I swear I have the biggest collection of onion volcano photos.  This chef placed his flame up high and it ignited an arms length above then flamed downward into the onions, which I thought was cool and different.   He cooked so quickly.  The onions were his only show. I only had time to take photos and next thing I knew all the food was cooked.  The vegetables were onion, broccoli, zucchini (partially charred), and mushroom.  Two shrimp for appetizer, did not taste fresh.  My filet mignon was nice and tender with a good amount of garlic and butter, good flavor."}
{"text":"I extremely lover this restaurant! My favorite place ever and the food is amazing especially the beef and chicken is cooked perfect and tender and prices were great as well but cheaper if you eat the same thing just lunch hours but totally worth it either way!"}
{"text":"We were this place last night. We ordered the medium size sashimi place,$50.00,it was such thin slice fish, quality was so so.  Also we ordered some salad ,we ordered beef salad, but we got tuna salad. It was taste ok. And 2 shrimp tempura udon, that was the most suck thing, the noodle was even under cook!no body can eat it. I gave one star just for the busboy JUDY, he was very nice for help, we spend over 200 dollars for four people we still feel hungry ,however I still leave good tips just for we get Judy's help , hope I didn't spell wrong his name.  A suck experience!"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh! We are totally in love with Osaka! We've been there several times in the last few weeks and everything we've tried is utterly fantastic.  The udon noodle soup is wonderful! Plus the sushi is made freshly while you watch, and the sushi chefs are wonderfully friendly.  The beef and chicken teriyaki should not be missed as they are fantastic!  My wife and I have decided that Osaka has the very best service in Henderson, no question about it! The staff here he is incredibly attentive and most delightful."}
{"text":"DO NOT BE SCARED WHEN YOU WALK IN. The entrance hall looks like a crack house. The restaurant you see when you get there is cramped and claustrophobic. so ASK FOR A BOOTH.There is a charming, intimate room in the back, shoes off, kneel down japanese tables. The food and service is great, a little pricier than several local places."}
{"text":"The food is so good here.  We had Sushi, Tempura, Tuna Poke, and Teriyaki chicken. And everything was outstanding. This will be our go to for Japanese food from now on."}
{"text":"Wow sushi that delivers! The rolls are great however some of the food that I bought I thought it was a roll however it's a rectangle shape thing. Not a roll. It's weird. I can't describe it. Make sure to select roll only."}
{"text":"Busy at 2:30 in the afternoon. This is one of the few off strip high quality places in Vegas. We had the Roppongi roll, 911 roll and Tiger Rolls, all incredible. The bldg/decor is not that great bit the food is top quality. The Toro ranks at the top. Prices very reasonable."}
{"text":"Yummy this place is the best!!! The food is so good and Zack was amazing. I would recommend this place to anyone and everyone. All the staff is super nice most defiantly will be back for more!!!!"}
{"text":"Always looking for a good Teppenyaki place in town and always drove by Osaka.  Took my family (including 2 kids) this evening and had a fantastic experience!  Delicious food and entertaining chefs.  A little pricey, but less expensive than Benihana and others.  They have a Karate Kids meal for a lower price which was perfect for my 8 and 12 year olds.  Green tea ice cream was a refreshing end to the evening.  Logged on to their website and signed up for their mailing list to receive a 10% coupon which I used for this visit.  Good stuff!"}
{"text":"Wonderful place to bring the kids. They love exploring the menu with there daddies!!!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for the last two years, and the service is friendly and warm; But as recent as last week, I notice they have new waiters and they aren't as friendly.  The sushi is consistently fresh, although it might not be the best cut like those I've had in Orange County. But if you're into tempura, this is the best place to go; it beats Frenzy Sushi in OC's tempura rolls.  The chef here are creative and they consistently create rolls that incorporate the East and West ingredients to provide customers with one of a kind experience.  If you like to try as many different roll as possible,go for it and get half roll instead of full roll, and trust me it's worth it. The tempura rolls are party-in-your-mouth good. I think it's great place to try to bring your love ones who are a little iffy about trying raw fish.  They won't notice because of the freshness of the fish and also the tasty sauce that come with it.  Other than the roll, their nigiri and sashimi are alright.  The uni is another good one to try, very fresh and buttery.  I got my sister to try it, and she's not a big sushi fan."}
{"text":"How can I be going to this place for 14 years and am just getting around to a review now?  I guess because I am too busy eating Japanese Lasagne ;)  Yes, that is your dessert, true sushi believers, trust me.  Ask for Mika and the nice fellow with short hair who gave me green tea once.  Also, splurge on their very special T-shirt that has a Sumo wrestler saying \"will work for sushi.\"  You'll get it after your Osaka addiction has begun.  At the end of your meal, ask for an Osaka frequent card since you can use it as a credit on your next meal!  Ok does everyone know to leave your shoes outside the tatami room with toes outward?  You'll be instantly recognized as a regular ;)"}
{"text":"Their food is amazing. The tatami rooms are just add ons to the whole dining experience.  The unagi bowl is WORTH IT. A little pricy but all sushi places are. If you get tired of buffet, definitely try this place."}
{"text":"Great good and ambiance - had a great time here.  Food was awesome.  The chef was very entertaining...very similar to Beni Hana if not better."}
{"text":"The only reason this is getting 2 stars is because the Filet Tataki was amazing.. But this is sushi, not a steakhouse.  We have been waiting on our check for quite some time and didn't even bother to finish our food because all of it, was not to our liking.  Wishing the check would come so we can just go to In n Out"}
{"text":"If you can get in, great. That main door to enter is so hard to open! I've been here a few times. Not my first choice but I came here because my friends adore this place and they have a rewards system where you rack up points every time you spend $. We came for their late night happy hour which starts at 10 PM. I rarely eat late only if I'm on vacation or been drinking but they have an OK deal for people who like to eat late. I didn't think it was that much of a bargain though.  Anyway, I have had some good nigiri here and their hand rolls are pretty fat and tasty (look at my salmon skin hand roll). Also, I enjoyed their fresh wasabi. I've only sat in front of the sushi counter so I don't have anything to say regarding their teppanyaki side and other areas. It's a decent place but something about the atmosphere and decor are outdated, boring, and a bit depressing to me. Service is alright. They can also be cleaner too (sticky menus and counters). Overall, I think it's OK but I can think of a lot of other sushi places in Vegas I would much rather go to."}
{"text":"I've been coming here my whole life. The zaru soba is good. The sushi used to be better. But I'll keep coming here because I have a place in heart for it."}
{"text":"Been coming here since the 1980's... Back again 2017.. Outstanding Great to get away from the Strip!"}
{"text":"The restaurant looked nice with exception to the brown water stain around the air conditioning intake vent. It was quiet inside with the exception that the front door we sat by slammed hard and squeaked continually due to lack of repair. The shabu-shabu was extremely sweet in comparison to more authentic cuisine. It tasted almost like candy, which leads me to believe it is over-Americanized. The gas burner we were using had trouble getting re-lit. When we turned it low, it would go out and we would have to manually re-light it. For as expensive as this restaurant was, they should be using stainless steel or ceramic chopsticks. This became most apparent when a member of my party wound up with a 1/8\" splinter in her finger, from the cheap wooden disposable chopsticks.   At this point, the only redeeming quality we found to this restaurant was our waiter. Our waiter, Jared, proved himself to be one of the best waiters in the world. Despite, being incredibly stretched thin between two rooms, he was on top of all of our needs and wound up loaning us a lighter to re-light the defective burner. He was not only kind and courteous, but in the extreme emergency of needing tweezers to remove the splinter, he was able to retrieve a pair from the emergency first aid kit that he carries in his car; because no one else in the entire restaurant had any tweezers or way to help us. We didn't waste any time tipping him EXTREMELY well."}
{"text":"I didnt even like or eat sushi before i had it here, now i bring a date every week, Thank you Chef's"}
{"text":"We usually order sushi for out business meetings. The food is always amazing but it takes so long to get your order. They also never put enough soy sauce in with it. But the sushi is delicious."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time and absolutely love! They have a HUGE menu and quality fish.  Tasteful, fresh and clean. Service was also great. Server was kind and helpful, all staff were attentive. Little pricey but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"First time to this place. the food is good. service was fine. It will definitely go into my rotation of sushi bars"}
{"text":"We went to this small older Japanese restaurant located in an outdated strip mall about 15 minutes from Elara on 4/10/17 for lunch.  Since they have limited tables, we ended up dining in one of the tatami rooms.  The sushi and nigiri was fine but not outstanding. Had the salad with seared tuna.  Not too bad but I have had better.   Prices were reasonable for the dishes but portions were on the small side.  Service was adequate though the waiter forgot to bring the miso soup that came with the lunch and we had to remind him at the end of the meal.   Probably not on my list to revisit on our next trip to Vegas since there are many other sushi restaurants to explore."}
{"text":"Awesome sushi!! Great ambience..nice place to come after work and have a drink and fresh food!!"}
{"text":"Amazing first time (hibachi) experience! The service was superb and the entertainment was magical. I had the 18$ dollar three course meal shrimp special and it was worth every dime my friends and I spent! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"WOW!! first off.. i love the way the seating is!.. must take off shoes in a japanese feel!.. u sit on what seems to be a pillow and what u might think of going 'indian style' lol!..however!.. u pretty much can put ur feet down below.. and the table is right in ur face!.. the tables are very intimate as they are separated by a paper wall.=] love the bamboo steps to the table.. beware of holed socks.. cuz like i said, u gotta take off ur shoes lol. ahha Second of all, there are soo many menus.. i wanna say 3 menus to choose from??.. what a very large selection to chose from..! ..i tried the teriyaki beef dinner which comes with the whole salad and soup ordeal and some tempura veggie and shrimp.. our friends ordered a lot of sumthing! but it was very pleasing! and appetizing i might add!.. cannot forget the dessert!.. super huge portions.. and loved the fried plantains, the tempura ice cream!!..waiter was thee best!.. couldnt ask for better service!.. i would definitely go back..and it makes me wanna look for a restaurant similar to this in LA!.. prices r pretty good, with the fact that since its vegas they close pretty late, and its 1/2 off!..LOVe this PLACE! =]"}
{"text":"Amazing service and great quality of sushi.  Amazingly, half rolls of sushi fill us up at just a few dollars more than all you can eat."}
{"text":"Are you sh*ttin' me?    Worst.  Sushi.  Ever.  May be we should have stayed away from the sashimi and nigiri.  May be when we asked about omakase and the waitress didn't know what we were talking about we should have just ordered some standard rolls off the menu.  May be they should have given us some fresh fish instead of the wretched crap they served.  May be upon seeing the dryness/lack of luster on the fish we should have just not eaten.  May be that salmon roe was in fact not from a jar.   May be I can recover from this horrible experience to enjoy sushi once again.  May be.  But probably not anytime soon..."}
{"text":"This was my second time eating at Osaka and my LAST!!  The first time the palce was so crowded that I could understand the slow service, but at least the waitress was attentive.  Tonight the waitress was awful, just rude.  And her behavior progressed as we explained to her how disappointed we where that she never brought us bowls for our sauces so that we could dip our sushi, my tuna stuffed jalapeno poppers took forever to bring out and that is one of the easiest items to prepare on the menu and the fastest!!!  One of my friends went up to the front and got her own bowl and the hostess brought us more water because our waitress just disappeard.  After we complained she asked if we would like a free dessert and we accepted that, but she rolled her eyes at her after we asked her if she was new.  Her english could have been better too, this is a Japanese restaurant, why would you hire an hispanic waitress whose english is mediocre????  We will not be coming back there, EVER!!  The food is good, but for service like that it's way overpriced!!"}
{"text":"We came in for breakfast on a whim and we were so glad we did!! The food was wonderful and he staff kind. All very reasonably priced! Will return!"}
{"text":"Food is usually delicious, but sometimes the miso soup is watery & bland. Main reason for the 3 star rating is that the restaurant decor is in bad need of a renovation. It's old, outdated and doesn't reflect greatly the quality food. My wife complains of a smell in the resturant. I smell it too, but I think its the tanks gir the live seafood. It wouldnt hurt to vent that smell outside the dining area, it isn't appetizing. Now the mens bathroom is similar to dirty roadside gas stations, that's not cleaned as if your own family/young children were using it daily. That usually steers me right away from any resturant, but the food has been quality & I've watched the sushi chefs like a hawk while seated at the bar in front of them. They are clean & good at their craft. I'd go more often if they'd invest a little to freshen up the whole \"little\" resturant. It wouldn't take much."}
{"text":"Went here for my husbands birthday dinner (my first time here his second) and it was so good!  Ordered:  App. = Yakitori, tender chicken but the sauce was a little bland. Not awsome but not bad, meh.  Sushi Oh my God = wish I had gotten just this and the Cajun Crunch so that I could have eaten more of them before getting full. Will come back just for those next time.  Cajun Crunch = a little kick but not overwhelming heat. I could taste all the ingredients not just the spicy sauce so I was happy.   777 roll = if it wasn't for the 2 rolls listed above this would be my favorite. Did not over do it on the cream cheese and the sauce really worked well with the mild fish.  Fire Roll = good but not great, won't get it again in favor of other rolls.  Katie Maki = tasty and a little different from what I'm used too (haven't had a roll with mushroom in it before) but I would have liked a little more shiitake in there as it was a little hard to differentiate the flavor.  Yum Yum Roll = Hubby said this was his favorite from his previous trip so we ordered a whole roll (got half rolls of some of the above so we could try more) so when it came I was excited to try it. I was underwhelmed. It was fine, just a simple plain roll but compared to the other yummies on the table I didn't want to spare valuable stomach space on it. After a couple of pieces hubby did say that he must have remebered wrong about this roll.   Green Tea Mochi Ice Cream = I had no room for dessert but hubby had this and pronounced it \"so tasty\".   Our dining compainions don't do sushi so they got the terriyaki chicken and shirmp tempura and deemed them delecious.  I was a little nervous going in after reading reviews on here about bad service but I couldn't have been happier with our service. Plates were cleared quickly and drink were kept full and we felt well taken care of.   We will be back for sushi numminess soon."}
{"text":"I put one star because I had too. The manager / owner and he was also the bartender. Was very rude unprofessional and have a problem with African Americans. The hostess said our table was ready but once the last person comes we will be seated. Once we all were there and saw us. She walked right by us with people. We Did not get a chance to eat because our table was given away after five minutes to accommodate another party. Manager and bus boy very confrontational. When asking questions about our reservation he got very irate and just wanted to kick us out."}
{"text":"When you come you MUST ask for \"the legendary Vanilla Rice\" aKa Zack He started as a dishwasher at 15 and developed MAJOR skills that rivals any and all Table chefs we have witnessed  Rumor has it he is working on some new tricks that will be ready in the next week... so we will be back soon! It's always a great family night out to have Vanilla Rice as our chef. Our 9 year old LOVES watching the BIG fire and trust us... VR goes big!!!!  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Osaka's a Las Vegas classic.  It's been around since before it was fashionable to do this whole sushi thing.    Housed in an older building and older section of the city, the restaurant ambles backward in odd angles, but it provides for different seating areas.  Up front is the sushi bar and traditional table seating, in the middle are Teppan grills, and in the rear are Tatami rooms.   Everything at Osaka is always delicious.  The fish is always fresh and looks appetizing.  I had some of the best tempura of my life here.  The chefs are very accommodating with special requests.  Once I attended a birthday party here with at least 20 - 25 people in attendance, all of whom were coming and going at different times, and the service was great.  Everything was prepared correctly and everyone's separated bills were correct as well.  It might not have the pomp and circumstance that other newer sushi bistros do, but Osaka is a safe bet for delicious, fresh food in a comfortable environment with superb service."}
{"text":"After my second satisfying visit, I decided this establishment was worthy of a review. The first time I came here with a friend I got sushi rolls and she got beef teriyaki. Both were delicious and the meals came out to about $30 for both, very reasonable for what we got! I came here with a few more friends this time, trying out their 10-2 late night specials. I loved the half rolls so we can try out a bunch of different rolls. The tempura ice cream dessert was to die for! I suggest this place for anyone who wants a late night snack."}
{"text":"The parking lot is tiny (but at night you can use the neighbor lot since the stores are closed). Once you walk in it looks like a sushi restaurant with a sushi bar. Then you walk through to the 2 grills and the more private oriental style tables. In the next room is regular tables. The 2 grills use 2 different chefs, facing opposite directions. While we were eating we were watching the other chef in action. Our chef was funny, both chefs had prank tricks, and the food was some of the freshest tasting japanese food I've ever tasted. The fried rice was amazing, the chicken and shrimp were perfectly seasoned, the salad dressing was perfect, BUT the miso soup was...eh. Will definitely be back next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"The food is average, nothing special =\ The person controlling the music wasn't soo good a lot of stop and play. One of the waitress was careless & just was like yea yea. The names on the menu was cool something different but that's about it =T"}
{"text":"Osaka Japanese Bistro is the   When I moved to Vegas 6 years ago, I missed the sushi culture that I had experienced living on the central coast CA my whole life.  I found out about Osaka Japanese Bistro when a local friend brought me to Happy Hour and I fell in love the minute I walked in.  They remember me and know what I order each time I dine here and they have amazing lunch and late night dinner specials.   Also,  I love all of Osaka's specials they treat to their locals.  Free sake every day for Happy Hour 4:30-7:00pm, buy a T-shirt and receive a free large sake and wear it into Osaka each time you eat and receive a free large sake.  They are open everyday from 11-2am & Osaka even have a VIP card for returning customers who get 10% of their check placed on a voucher for your next party"}
{"text":"TIP: Food and drink specials from 10pm-2am!  The best time to come to Osaka is between 10pm-2am.  Any other time, it's just mediocre, and I'd recommend I Love Sushi or Sushi Mon over Osaka.  But if you're coming here for late night eats, it's pretty sweet.  It's cheap, with orders ranging anywhere from $3 to $12.  They have a wide selection from their specials menu, which includes poke, appetizers, sushi rolls, beer, and sake, among other things.  The sushi is okay--it's not the freshest around, but it doesn't taste fishy either; so it's good for the price.  The appetizers are good.  I enjoy the poke and the different salad options.  The sake and beer are always staples.  It's surprising, but it DOES get a little crowded for midnight eats in Henderson.  There's no wait or anything, but yeah, a bit of a shocker that there were so many people!"}
{"text":"We went here with a big group on a Friday night, a group of 15. There was no wait and the servers were friendly although it took them hella long to get our order even though all of our table was seated. Anyways we ordered beers and sake and we were gonna try the sake sampler nigori flight, but I was told it was super small and not worth it by a friend who had been there before. Anyways for our big group we ordered 3 large boats for 55$ each. I was like whatever because we were with a group but really I am Asian and this deal was the shittiest deal ever.  For 55$ you get 2 half or age slices (so basically 1 whole orange) 15 slices of crappy beef/steak that had no flavor except the teriyaki sauce they dumped onto it. And the chicken looked dry and freeze dried and was absolutely horrible. Also this 55$ boat came with 7 pieces of sushi. I thought it was gonna be at least nigiri but it was actually 2 pieces of salmon, 2 tuna, 2 white albacore and a shitty shittay flavorless imitation California roll. What a disappointment!!! I am so accustomed to have lots of sushi and nigiri and oh the best part of the boat was the tempura. Kinda oily but sadly the best part. I would come here again because I had fun with friends but the food was quite Terrible. We also ordered the Kalbi skewers and it wasn't Kalbi it was more like bi-bim-bap on a stick. Also the steak roll were terrible and dry. And the best thing was the sappo roll. Tasty refreshing and real fish.  The only thing that made this tolerable was the large Sapporo and sake. Ps my friend said the Cole slaw was good.  And also I asked for extra ginger an hour ago and it never came. See attached piece of chicken. It was freeze dried and no one ate it because it looked like rubbery dried intestines."}
{"text":"Well, I must say I was quite hesitant when we saw the place. It is in a cheap strip mall surrounded by 'exotic' shoe and dance wear stores. Very unassuming decor and a very small seating area..but.......The food is amazing!! I have not had sushi this good in a very, very long time.Tough to get fresh fish in Vegas but this place manages to deliver an amazing meal. Enjoyed watching Chef make our rolls. Sadly the reason for the 4 stars: The servers were sloooooow. It took a long time for them to bring our  drinks and refills. Thankfully we sat at the sushi bar so were served our food immediately from Chef. I will go again."}
{"text":"Found this place and Yelp and came here for some Zaru Udon. It was the only place open super late on a Thursday night that didn't sound too pricey.  I ordered the zaru somen since they ended up not having the zaru udon after all. Ialso got the Virgin roll and my husband got beef yaki soba.   The roll was delicious but the problem I had is they messed up both our orders. They gave me some weird udon chicken soup and my husband this chicken stew with onions. At first, I didn't know what to do since I've never had mine let alone both our orders messed up beyond reason.  I don't like complaining to waiters usually so we just dealt with it. I did end up telling our female waiter both our orders got messed up and all she said was, \"oh\" and walked off.   I honestly would return here because the sushi was delicious but I'm still disappointed how much they fucked up our order."}
{"text":"4 stars b/c I wish they were AYCE  Osaka's is one of the original sushi joints in Las Vegas. Their rolls are very delicious but they do get costly b/c they don't offer all you can eat. When my bf and I go here our bill is usually $100+. Osaka's is good if you don't want to be gluttonous."}
{"text":"This was my first time dining at Osaka, and I was pretty underwhelmed. I was also disappointed with the prices they charged for what we ordered. We ordered a salmon skin roll, poke salad, and I shared a beef and chicken teriyaki combination with my wife. The salmon skin roll was horrible. There was barely any salmon skin in the roll, and what crunch I did feel was not the salmon skin but the cucumber/carrots in the roll. There was also way too much rice in the roll as well. The poke salad was not actually poke salad as I expected it to be, but instead it was a plate of seaweed salad with a several cubes of ahi around it. This was $17?!? The teriyaki beef and chicken combination was equally half assed. It was just grilled slices of beef and chicken with teriyaki sauce (alot of it at that) poured on top. I don't think they actually grilled the meat with the sauce. This was $18?!?   The service was good and the server kept topping off my soda, and that's why I'm giving two stars. I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I went out to Osaka (again) tonight.  I've been going for 35 years.  This was, literally, the BEST meal I have ever had!  The Pocket Ace roll was the most incredible combination of flavors--each bit from each roll we ordered was better then the last.  The menu is always changing, so it is 'new' all the time.  I am normally disappointed with desserts in Asian restaurants, but the ice cream filled fried pound cake was delicate, crispy and sweet.  I loved the fresh blueberries on top.  I've been to restaurants much pricier, but never better!"}
{"text":"I was recommended to come to this delicious Japanese place while on my visit to Las Vegas. We tried the Japanese lasagne, bacon wrapped asparagus, and other traditional sushi rolls. I visited this location with my family and it is very family oriented. Wonderful friendly service and fresh food. Can't wait to come back. Definitely a must try at least once."}
{"text":"Haters can hate but EVERY SINGLE TIME i have been here, it's been great. I remember the first time i ever went was back in like 2002, I saw Mr. Miyagi there on his BIRTHDAY!!! SO COOL!!!!  anyways... go there for HAPPY HOUR!!! Half-rolls, half-price+Sake= HEAVEN"}
{"text":"I freaking love Osaka.  No joke - I call them for a pick-up order, and they're like, \"Evelyn, is that you?\"  An intervention may be in order...  At any rate, if you love sushi, check out Osaka.  They're not the cheapest place in town, but it's still better than the strip.  This is no AYCE hack joint; but you can order half-rolls and go to town with the variety - they also have a decent happy hour/late night menu.    My favorites are the Oh Kamis"}
{"text":"Osaka is easily one of the most civilized sushi restaurants in Vegas, and it's my \"default\" sushi spot.  I have come to thoroughly dislike the multitude of \"fusion\" sushi joints cropping up all over town. The majority of them are owned by Koreans and have little in common with traditional Japanese food.  Thankfully, Osaka is an oasis here in the Mojave desert. Having been around for more than 40 years, they were doing traditional sushi long before it has hip or trendy. And they've stuck with a traditional approach, relying on top-quality ingredients and skilled chefs.  The owner told me he gets his fish from the same supplier as Nobu and they often split a fish between the two restaurants. To the sushi snob, the difference is apparent.   As wonderful as the food is, the dining experience is what really sets Osaka apart. From the coziness of the sushi bar to the tranquility of the tatami rooms, Osaka offers the most civilized dining experience I've encountered so far. No blaring hip hop, no trendy decor, no pushy servers, just an hour or two of peace and tranquility to enjoy good quality food. It's like Zen meditation with raw fish. Divine."}
{"text":"The BEST EVER!!! from the waiter..David..who brought be stuff he thought I'd like to the food!! My WHOLE meal was WONDERFUL!! had the ume handroll which had a special adding to it..NEVER had one that was better!! And had the curry udon..no doubt the BEST udon EVER!!! SooO awesome Japanese restaurant!! Next time I'll sit in the back thats like authentic Japanese eating! LOVE this place..I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"My top choice for sushi in Vegas.  I've visited 2 locations in Vegas, but the Henderson location feels like home.  They are quick to learn your name and the staff couldn't be any nicer!  Try the 777 Roll!"}
{"text":"The reason why I'm giving them 2 stars is because the food was just as good as usual but service wise I would love to not even give them stars (I know that you can't possibly give a place 0 stars)...  Normally service isn't incredibly fast here so it's not like I came here expecting a quick meal...but tonight we came to celebrate my dad's birthday and we are going on almost 2 hours of being here...our server doesn't seem to have many tables yet appears to not know how to be efficient at his job...it took over 6 minutes to receive our beverages....over 15 min to order our food....food took a little longer than usual for delivery...and we had to have a completely different person bring us a dessert menu and take our dessert order because our server was no where to be found....  I usually like to support what seems to be local business....but it's hard to be supportive when their own service team seems not to care about valuing their patrons' time....  Looks like it'll be a while before I decide to return here!"}
{"text":"BEST Japanese restaurant in Las Vegas.  The food and service is 5 Stars.  The servers (Mike and Jared) are very attentive and knowledgeable.   If your in Las Vegas give it try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best nigiri I've had.  It's clear that they know their fish and provide great quality.  The 12 piece chef's choice nigiri was a great value at $35, with excellent amaebi, uni, toro etc.  Well over $35 worth of sushi and every piece was great quality.  Even the beef teriyaki that my 7 year old nephew had received excellent reviews from everyone at the table due to the quality of the meat.    The service of the staff lived up to the quality of the food as well. If you're visiting the strip and want some great Japanese food, avoid the crowds and head a couple miles west on Sahara to Osaka.  I'll be going every time I'm in town."}
{"text":"The prices are the only thing keeping this place from being 5 stars...and maybe for some the location.  It has a weird entrance that is a brick wall hallway that you walk around to get in the actual restaurant , and outside it is surrounded by  sinful shops - but thats vegas!  I had the Japanese Lasagna roll (8 pieces for $7.95) which if you like creamy flavors is really awesome and probably one of the best values on the menu.  I asked about happy hour and it is just at the sushi bar from 4-6 PM.  I thought it was odd that no one was at the bar so I'm guessing the happy hour menu isn't so great but I don't know.  I split the Rock shrimp salad (one medium plate for $12 I think) and it was pretty good, not great.  The shrimp were kind of bland but the sauce was good - and the salad portion was just iceberg lettuce and a few carrots.  My date had the Jalapeno Tuna sushi special of the day (8 small pieces for $18) which she said was great.  She also had a half roll of the Dynamite roll I think (4 pieces for $7)  which was a shrimp roll with crunchy flakes on top.  I had a bite and it was well flavored but a bit hard to discern the flavors because of the crunchy/dry stuff they put on it.    Service was good and the coolest thing about this places is the intimate booths that are old school Japanese style where you take your shoes off and sit on the floor (there is a place to put your legs under the table however), but this might get uncomfortable for a some during a long dinner."}
{"text":"We love this place! My children luve the tepanyaki bar and the food is always great they love Chef White Boi! Sushi is also super fresh!"}
{"text":"Have tried the Osaka on Sahara and this one a few times.  Our favorite zaru soba place closed so it was nice to find another restaurant that sells angood one.  Not too noisy and the menu is quite large so there should be something for everyone.  The sushi is ok but I prefer the noodle and curry dishes.  The green tea cake was good.  Unfortunately, I cannot comment on the teppanyaki.  Will continue to return."}
{"text":"Pretty terrible quality of raw fish and uni. Its the same as what you get at all-you-can-eat sushi - but more expensive. 2stars. Firm.  However, late night special is cheap. If you are drunk and wanna fill up your stomach, this place is ok. I give 3 stars for the late night special.  Only good thing about it is the location. It's near the Strip."}
{"text":"Love this place! I've never tried anything I didn't like here. They have lunch and late night specials. I go about once a week and enjoy the Japanese tatami style tables. The employees are all very kind and attentive as well!"}
{"text":"This is our go-to sushi spot in the city. We're usually going with a big group (10-20 people), and they've always been VERY accommodating. The sunken tables (tatami rooms?) with legroom underneath are great for big groups, allowing a little privacy, and the service is always pretty good. Good house sake, standard Japanese beers.  I wouldn't say it's the best sushi I've ever had, but it's up there enough to keep us coming back. And it's certainly been consistent in my experience."}
{"text":"Was greeted, seated and served all within a timely period. Had kitsune udon soup with marinated tofu and some kind of fish broth. Helped after a long exhausting trip to Vegas. At the end tried green tea tiramisu, pricey but most worth it.  They have eating area (I was starving so just stayed there cause it was empty) and Japanese rooms. On right side they have stylish sit-down counter where you can watch them prepare sushi.   Next time will try more of their dishes when not as tired."}
{"text":"LISA LISA IS THE BOMB. Just saying. So my sister and I came here with our Dad, he had been living in Las Vegas for about a year, and he wanted to show us what good 'Las Vegas sushi' tasted like. I was skeptical. I mean, Las Vegas is a freakin' desert so I didn't expect the sushi to be as impeccable as we have it here in the city by the bay. Nicky B is a pretty foolish kid.   We walked in and I was immediately amazed with all the cool-futuristic-tables and high definition televisions that played menu items over and over again. We sat down at the sushi bar. Our sushi-chef was really nice. My dad knew him, so we he talked to us about stuff. Pretty cool. Then comes the food. I take a bite. I'm blown away! Wow. It was incredible. Tasty. Ahhh. Lisa Lisa I love you. Try it ya'll. You'll fall in love too."}
{"text":"Came to Osaka really late during my trip out to Vegas to check out the happy hour with some friends, and saw this place had great reviews.  We certainly didn't have a terrible experience, but I can't say I'd come here again.  I got a California Roll, chicken wings and shared a Japanese Burger sushi which was weirdly unique but tasted pretty good.  The California roll tasted odd, I'm not sure if the avocado was in the best shape, but it was alright.  The chicken wings were cool too, and we also shared some edamame.  But the prime reason I'm giving this place 1 star is the price.  This place is ridiculously expensive.  Even a plain 6-piece cucumber roll was $4.  You can get that other places for a buck.  And this was happy hour!   I can get way better sushi for a fraction of cost elsewhere.  No thanks, Osaka."}
{"text":"Osaka's used to be really good.  My last two trips were disappointing because the sushi rice tasted odd.  My previous trips to Osaka's were great.  The spicy scallop hand rolls were fantastic.  The price is a little steep, to say the least.  The service is great if they're not busy."}
{"text":"My hubby and I come in all the time for their late night menu. YUM and great prices! One of our favorite sushi spots! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Came in for a birthday at the teppanyaki grill area with a group of 6. Great cook with a great show. Had the fish and veggies entree. Honestly never had a better fish and veggies dinner. Thank you!! Loved it!!"}
{"text":"I held high expectations of this place due the the praise it had been given by multiple reviewers. But I was throughly disappointed. When I walked in and was lost I walked out one of the servers chased after me to not go out the door bc it would set off an alarm. Thus begins the terrible service from the wait staff. They told me to just walk in even though I had no clue where I was going and were pushy. When I got done and settle with my friends to eat they got my order wrong twice. When I did receive my sashimi I had been disappointed by the size portion and the taste of one of the tunas made my tongue roll over and die. If you are going to serve sashimi at least make it fresh. The waiters were extremely confused when bringing out our dishes and slightly unprofessional where I literally thought they were all high. When it came time for the check I was very angry they included gratuity because the food was mediocre and the service was terrible save for just one waiter. You are better off avoiding this place."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place after seeing it on Diners, Drive-Ins, ad Dives. We were promptly greeted and seated. The server was very polite and courteous. We ordered, I had the OG Special and my husband ordered chicken fried rice, we also had steamed gyoza. The gyoza was awesome, and the fried rice was really good. We like a little more egg in our fried rice than most so it was perfect for us. My roll was interesting. The rice is crispy like it was grilled or something, which I wasn't expecting because I didn't completely read the description. It was really good, you just have to get passed the square shape, heated, crispyness. As we were getting our food a large party showed up and they got all of the attention. We ran out of water and waited over 20 minutes for a server to bring us our check so we could leave. We would have asked sooner if we had seen them but they were lost in the back with the huge party. Very unfortunate for a place with such outstanding reviews."}
{"text":"This location is my favorite...yes its a older building but the tunami rooms are awesome :-) I love slipping off my shoes and slidding into the tunami booths. Something about the cozy intamate booth munching on good food while sipping on some plum wine....sigh* it just puts me in my happy place :-) and for you parents out their with toddlers...the tunami rooms are perfect for little ones (like mine) that do not like sitting still and being in high chairs :-D they are able to move more and stand while eating while keeping them nicely contained ;-) you can actually have a nice meal without chasing around your little cuteness!!"}
{"text":"We came here to celebrate our son's birthday, since we always go to I love Sushi we thought it would be a nice change. Oh it was! Amazing!!   We started with a variety of sashimi, which came out super fast and was very fresh. Every piece was the perfect temperature and was tender.  Then we went on to rolls. One of my favorites there is the Roppongi roll. It's spicy tuna, shrimp, topped with tuna masago and yum yum sauce. We also had the bonsai, Tokyo express and 3 others. Two kids opted for the tonkatsu and curried rice. I don't like curry but there's was REALLY good.  Highly recommended, we've been there before, but this was our first time not doing hibachi/teppanyaki. We will be back."}
{"text":"Ohhh I got the regular badge from here :-) That excited me.  This place is really good. I'm a sushi aficionado. I try to visit as many high rated local places in town. Frankly Osaka is REALLY far from my house but it's close to my surgeon's office. So where did we go for lunch after my two post op appointments?    ... You got it!  They give you the option of Teppanyaki, Sushi bar or the traditional Japanese seating on the floor with big fun fluffy pillows!  I love their lunch menu. They offer low priced high quality half rolls. We ordered a bunch!   007 Roll - $8.95 Shrimp tempura roll topped with spicy tuna  Citrus Lemon Salmon - $6.50 Salmon with lemon and salt  We ordered a few more with unusual names but they were all amazing and fresh. They also have an amazing Saki selection:  Nagasaki Mandarin Infused - $22.00/btl Ginjo Ty Ku - $13.00/gl, $48/btl Tozai \"Living Jewel\" Unfiltered - $15.00/btl Daiginjo Ultra Premium Horim - $26.00/btl Daiginjo Ultra Premium Hakatsuru - $12.00/gl, $46.00/btl Otokoyama Junmai - $11.00/gl, $20.00/btl Momokawa Genshu \"G-Joy\" - $18.00/btl Nigori Murai - $12.00/gl, $46.00/btl Nigori Tozai - $15.00/btl   We will be returning!"}
{"text":"Really like the decor and seating arrangements, you feel like in a private upscale restaurant. The sushi rolls are quite good, however the small dishes such as teriyaki/udon/etc are overpriced and not impressive.  Good for late night sushi and drinking session but who wants to drive so far from the strip?"}
{"text":"I ordered chicken katsu and the chicken was so thin. Price is bit overpriced. Salad was not really fresh. Overall quality was mediocre. I'm still giving 4 stars because the tempura they had was ridiculously good."}
{"text":"Went here with a big group of girls. First loved the traditional seating. We got a ton of rolls and the lychee sake. It was all very good!  Not a single roll I did not like. The fish was fresh and the variety on the menu was great.  For dessert, go with the classic -tempura fried ice cream."}
{"text":"The OhMyGod roll is the best. I've never had anything but terrifice service too!!  Hands down my fav sushi spot I've found so far."}
{"text":"Customer service was terrible! Showed up last night with a Groupon for the teppanyaki dinner for 2. The manager said they do not accept Groupons although I had just bought the offer an hour before for that exact location. He had very little explanation except for saying it would come out of his pay check. Disappointed that there was not any comp for their mistake. I will not be back because of this experience. Now I have to get a refund from groupon. What a waste of my time!"}
{"text":"I took my wife and son out to this place for her birthday dinner. We had the Teppan grill. The chef was awesome and my 4 year old son had a blast! The chef was very entertaining and the food was delicious! It was a great value and a lot of food! We left happy and full. Thanks for making my wife happy on her birthday. She also had a great time!"}
{"text":"I think it's very sad when the TV commercial says \"food prepared by professional Japanese chefs\" in the picture shows some white guy chef flipping some food to a Japanese family. Fortunately the food wasn't as awful as that stupid commercial. When we were there my chef couldn't even speak a word of Japanese. I think most Japanese chefs know a little bit of Japanese because of their family origin."}
{"text":"Loved it!!!!  Saw it on DDD and it was well worth the trip off the strip.  We had the Roppongi, Oh Kamisama, and White Tiger rolls.  We also had the Blue Fin Tuna, Skipjack, Thai Hamachi and Special Tai nigiri.  Everything was amazing and super fresh!  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The hibachi is solid minus the chicken in my opinion, the sushi is the star of the show here. My favorite roll of all time \"Pocket aces\" no cream cheese is at Osaka, and the nigiri is always top notch fresh. I'm a regular here"}
{"text":"Osaka has been a long standing Japanese Restaurant in the valley...I can only say it was Ok for me.  It's been many years since my last visit to Osaka Japanese Bistro on Sahara, but on this windy night, I came here with my girl friend in preparation for her upcoming trip to Osaka, Japan, as she wanted to try Okonomi Yaki.    Also we ordered  - Tako Wasabi - Chirashi  - Tokujo Nigiri: 12 pcs of nigiri Chef's choice   My favorite was Tako Wasabi...fresh and crunchy. The Chirashi had so much rice in the bowl, but was also packed with fresh cuts of fish which we enjoyed...unlike the nigiri, that seemed to all be dry and bland.  Service was excellent...they never stop filling our cups with hot tea and water.    Unfortunately for Osaka Japanese Bistro, Vegas has so much competition for sushi lovers, and Osaka stands as just average for me.  -2017 review #30-"}
{"text":"I was extremely disappointed. I did have my food delivered, so i guess I  missed out on the dining experience of the actual resteraunt which, from the photos, looks nice.    I ordered the soft shell crab, shrimp tempura, firecracker shrimp, korean kalbi short ribs, and fried tofu. In total my order cost over $70.00. For that price I expect deliciousness; what I got was buyer's remorse.   The food arrived cold. Disappointingly included in my order was one small box of white rice and three containers of what had to be miso soup (which i did not order) but NO teriyaki, ponzu, or any kind of dipping sauce. I ate my tempura dry. The korean short ribs were so incredibly chewy I spat them out. The fried tofu was soggy and bland with a few spring onions thrown in the box. The softshell crab was dry with no flavor. It came with a cream sauce that was extremely runny compared to similar sauces I've had. The only redeeming dish was the firecracker shrimp - it was seasoned well, the texture was great, and it had just enough spice to make it tasty with a kick.  Overall the food was bland, dry, sloppily packaged for delivery, and a huge let down. I would not recommend."}
{"text":"Mixed feelings about this place.  The building is kinda weird.  You walk in through he sushi bar room to get to the hostess station.  So, if you're sitting in the sushi bar room, which is small, everyone walks by you.  The room had adequate lighting but looked aged.  There is a breeze coming from the vents that would blow for a while and then stop and start and stop.   Appetizers we got gyoza, kalbi sticks, spring rolls.  We did not like any of the appetizers.  Kalbi didn't have any carmelization and lacked the flavor I expect.  Spring rolls where real small and didn't have much filling.  gyoza were small with a thin shell and appeared to be deep fried, so there were crispy all around.  We're used to them being fried on one side and steamed on one side.    We got a roll sampler that had spicy tuna, las vegas roll, cal roll and a shrimp tempura roll.  Rolls were meh, just okay.  Don't think I would order those again.    Then we ordered salmon, yellowtail, and smoked salmon nigiri along with a futomaki roll.  The nigiri was good.  The futomaki roll appeared to have been refrigerated.  Seaweed was a little hard and the rice was cold.    I think if we only got nigiri, this place could have been a 4 star, but with what we got, 2 stars is about all I can give"}
{"text":"Eh ...  Okay, I'll start with the good:  The ambiance and service was great.  They have those low tables, where you take your shoes off and/or sit cross-legged.  Our server was very friendly and hospitable.  The so-so: The food was okay.  I had tempura vegetable Udon soup and a side of vegetable rolls.  The tempura vegetable was good.  The Udon soup and vegetable rolls were okay.  The BF had curry rice.  I tasted the curry, and it was good.  The BF said the chicken was pretty good.  His Sister had Soba noodles.  I'm not a big fan of these noodles, but it she appeared to enjoy it.  I also had a melon soda, which was really good!  It has a marble in the drink, which is entertaining for little kids.  The bad:  The price was a little steep for an average Japanese restaurant.  It came out to $30 a person.  The pitcher of beer also has a large cone in the middle of it so that you don't get as much beer as you think you're getting.  Helpful hint:  They have a point card for those frequent patrons.  Overall, I wouldn't object to going here again, but it's not my first choice."}
{"text":"Best green tea! Garlic tuna nigiri. Yellowtail w ponzu n jalapeño nigiri. Wild salmon. Best spicy tuna rolls. Asakusa roll is redic! Dessert great too!!!"}
{"text":"I have never had a bad experience at this restaurant. The fish is fresh, delicious, and the service is excellent. For something different, try the Rock & roll - it's bliss."}
{"text":"just ate here tonight. this place sucked big time. everything was so soggy! first off the diet coke was flat and too much syrup. my friend ordered the caterpillar roll and the rice was so soggy. i ordered the cali roll and yuck....too much rice vinegar & crappy fake crab meat....the tempura i could not believe they served me what they did.... the tempura was not crispy at all, it was mushy, almost like it wasn't cooked all the way! the oyako donburi was aight but too much rice and not enough chicken! this place is outrageously over rated! will not go back. Brians Beach is da bes if you want fresh ass sushi!"}
{"text":"Really good sushi, the chefs where really friendly and fast. Disappointed there was no all you can eat. But still had a great time."}
{"text":"5 stars because this place was wonderful! Our server was phenomenal and the food was better than Benihana's! The manager came by our table and was so friendly. He stopped and talked to us for a little bit before checking with other tables.  We will definitely be returning :)"}
{"text":"Extraordinary sushi! We tried the 777, the Kamakaze, and the Oh Kamisama all featured on their late night menu. YUMMMMM! The service was also excellent. We ate at the sushi bar and had speedy and friendly service. So glad to have found this spot!"}
{"text":"Would not visit again!!! The cook for our grill was very nice, but that did not make the rice taste any 'nicer'!"}
{"text":"Saw this was on Diners, Dives, and Drives. I frequent Vegas quite a bit, so, had to make a stop here! It was really good! Will definitely make a return back!"}
{"text":"Today was my birthday and my children decided to take me to the Osaka Japanese restaurant on Sahara. We sat down excited about the fun of celebrating, expecting an entertaining chef. Instead we had to endure watching a chef struggle through preparing our dinner. He was totally unsure of himself and acted very confused. He kept dropping the utensils then bending down to pick them up off the floor, proceeding to wipe  them off with a wet towel...then reusing them. He could only prepare one item at a time and it was so stressful to watch. His knife skills were a d- at best. Not to mention that he brought out two pieces of meat, with one looking fresh and the other looking brown and old.  My daughter asked him about the color of the meat and he said it was fine. Then he offered to cover it in teriyaki sauce to improve the bad smell and taste. My daughter had to excuse herself to the restroom because she felt nauseous knowing it would make her sick if she ate that steak. I then told the very nice waiter what was going on and he explained we were the first people he had prepared a meal for. I said that the chef told us he had been working there twelve years. He said, yes, that was true....but he was working there in other jobs like bussing tables. I could go on about this negative experience but must stop with this final thought...I just do not understand and it is beyond me how they could let an untrained incompetent person play chef at the expense of their unsuspecting customers. Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"Really fresh sake. Great rolls. Nice option to get a half or a full roll. Delicious lychee sake. Fast service. Amazing!"}
{"text":"This is the oldest sushi place that I know of in this town. They were  doing  sushi before it was cool. The original on Sahara brings fond memories of emami I didn't know existed before 1986. Now they have blossomed all over the valley  I haven't been disappointed at any of them. Thanks Osaka for Introducing me to Japanese cuisine."}
{"text":"Being from Hawaii I'm  familiar with good Japanese food. I had the shrimp tempura and chicken combo. It came with 4 large shrimp 2 carrots 1 zucchini and onion ring. Tempura batter was light and crispy. On par with the best tempura I've had. The teriyaki chicken came with a light tasting teriyaki sauce. Pleasant and not over powering. My wife had the pork tofu. The broth was excellent. It had a good portion of pork but lacked enough tofu. And the dish was over powered by an over abundance of onion. The price of the entrees was reasonable."}
{"text":"I came across this place because I was looking for all-you-can-eat in the Henderson area and ended up at this place near the The Anthem area.   Which is a very beautiful community, and very peaceful.  I called to make sure if they had all you can eat and the young lady on the phone said that they didn't have all you can eat on Sundays!  only on Mondays, Tuesday they have all you can eat. but she asked me how far I was which I was around the corner and she said she would do all you can eat for me since I've never been there. which I thought was very thoughtful.   When arriving there was no one there so we had the whole place to ourselves. the manager was very attentive with great hospitality and was very welcoming. She did amazing in service!   The manager mentioned that we had to try the popular roll which was \" sexy number one special\" ! And that was not part of the all-you-can-eat, but then again she accommodated us again for us to try and  experience. she made us feel special.   Definitely will return to this place. the food and experience was amazing!  very pleased."}
{"text":"We are regular customers of Osaka Japanese Bistro on Eastern in Henderson NV, we saw they has a special Groupon for Teppanyaki for four. We decided why not? It was FANTASTIC the food was excellent ,Sake was warm and delicious , Asahi (Japanese Beer for those who don't know) was cold and crisp. Our Teppan Chef was hilarious and attentive to every detail. He engaged my 13 yr old daughter in a witty banter and had her as his foil. She enjoyed the show and food tremendously. My husband and her salmon was cooked to perfection, our Japanese fried rice was light and extremely delicious. My rib eye was rare perfectly cooked and expertly seasoned. We had sushi and sashimi for appetizers all were excellent and fresh. Definately an experience we will seek to duplicate in the future! I highly recommend Osaka, the staff are well versed and polite and the food is divine. Live Jazz on Thursday also!!"}
{"text":"This place is super cool considering it's in Vegas.  Japanese style tables, a sushi bar, and some pretty shockingly good food that's reasonably priced for it's proximity to the strip.  Don't expect anyone to know where this is if you're taking a cab.  Bring an address and have mapped it out first.  I thought that it was an abandoned building from the outside, but after entering through the air conditioning airlock, it was business as usual on the inside.  This may be my second favorite secret japanese place for when I'm in town."}
{"text":"I love the tappenyaki dinners there. The sushi is always fresh alittle expensive but worth the quality.  Definitely a recommend go to place.  I am happy to know they are using group on know to help make it alittle more affordable."}
{"text":"Excellent Sushi. Like that you can get 1/2 rolls or full rolls. For 2 of us the bill cam to over $90.00 this included 1 small sake & a beer plus green tea tempura ice cream."}
{"text":"AR is one of the best servers.  He remembered my husband from a year later. He even changed the tv so that we could watch the Raider game. I hope that he will be there is March 2016. The next time I will be there."}
{"text":"Customer service here is great. A couple of weeks ago I brought in a friend who knew nothing about sushi. He ordered a few rolls including the salmon roll and when it was brought out he said I can't eat this because it is raw. I then told him that the fish in sushi is raw unless specified otherwise. The waiter came around and could tell he hadn't touched it and asked if something was wrong. He said yeah I just really didn't know it was raw and the waiter laughed and said no problem I will take it off the bill. First off it was my friends fault and I am not used to Asian people who work at restaurants having good customer service.  My usual order here is the miso cod and the cucumber salad with crab. Both dishes are executed well. The miso cod is both tender and flakey and the crab salad has a refreshing flavor that pairs well with the miso cod."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I ate here for dinner last night and it was nothing short of amazing.   We had a reservation for 8 but, with traffic on the east side, we made it around 8:15 and they still sat us right away around the Teppan bar. The young man got us our drinks speedy quick but still gave us time to look at the menu.   I got the Chicken and NY with the Calamari Steak appetizer and a 911(spicy, spicy tuna) roll and half a California. While my girlfriend got the Chicken and Shrimp and Calamari Steak as well. It was about 3 minutes from when he left our table that we had already gotten our soup and salad, delicious.   When our chef came out, he seemed quiet at first but then really started interacting with my girlfriend and I as the night progressed. I won't get too much into his routine because I feel like that's something special everyone should see but it was very cool.   My steak and chicken were perfectly cooked along with the friend rice and the Calamari Steak, tasted very authentic. The Sushi was delicious, not too crazy but not too plain, I loved every bite.   Our tab came out to 112.28 after our $20 tip, not bad considering how much food we got and the amazing service. Came here for our birthday dinner and was fulfilled in every single way. We will come here again with an empty stomach and a big smile :)"}
{"text":"First Time there and what made us go was the GroupOn Special.. but needless To Say we had The Best Service There and the Staff was Awsome!!Big Thank You To Sonny and our waitress and The Manager was great"}
{"text":"My friends and I go here all the time, sushi is awesome. Everyone is super friendly. And the desserts are the bomb!"}
{"text":"We go here often for tepan. The food is good and good service. The quality of the meat is good too. Not has sushi here but I want to try one day"}
{"text":"Great local place. It's been in Vegas for years. Be sure to ask for Ryan on the grill."}
{"text":"My companion raved about this restaurant for quite some time.  She raved about the quality of the food and service.  I decided to try this joint and not upset her.  For a eating establishment I should write about the food but I couldn't.  Once we were seated I noticed a strong smell of urine at our table.  I discovered the smell came from the seat cushion I was sitting on.  After I moved the cushion away the offending smell still linger in my nostrils.  My companion beg me not to make an issue out of it. I complied. I recalled ordering my food but I couldn't tell if it tasted good or bad.  I lost my appetite. I can't believe the cleaning staff didn't noticed it.  I know I won't go back to this joint and my companion will have to bear with my objection for a second visit."}
{"text":"This place is filthy. We are sitting in the back at a booth and the space next to the wall is an inch thick in dirt. The place in general in unkempt.  The food was fair but 4 rolls and they all tasted the same."}
{"text":"Warning: this review might be a little partial since I just has the regular Japanese food and didn't eat sushi.  So we got here at around 7pm on a Sunday and was expecting someone to greet and sit us. We probably waited for about 5 minutes before someone came out and brought us to our table. There wasn't much customers that time too. Probably 1/4 of the tables or not even were occupied.    So we ordered asparagus wrapped in beef and another one that I totally forgot. The appetizers were okay but something that we may never order again (hopefully we remember not to order it again). I had the sukiyaki for my main entree and my bf had a curry over rice. They were both delicious and flavorful.   Maybe we will go back to Osaka to try their sushi dishes next time."}
{"text":"This is our go-to spot for good, local inexpensive sushi and ramen.  Can't go wrong coming here.  We always get at least a lasagna roll and spicy tuna roll when we come for lunch.  The shoyu ramen has a nice clean broth and they bring you the togarashi without even asking for it.  Good stuff."}
{"text":"Stopped here on a whim, and was very pleased. We sat at the bar, and didn't even know how big the restaurant was. Great service and food- and let me just say- there is nothing wrong about the \"something wrong\" dish!! YUM!"}
{"text":"Another must-eat during our Vegas culinary adventures.  Almost always accommodating (no wait) for this quiet haven of quality food!!  The soft shell crab appetizers are a winner and almost anything else will not disappoint!!"}
{"text":"I have been to a lot of places and this one may be on my list of faves. The staff were quick, efficient and kind. The food was amazing as was our chef (I wish I could remember his name). The only reason that I am not giving them 5 stars is because we ordered 2 slices of cheesecake at $7.95 per slice and they were THE SMALLEST pieces of cheesecake I've ever received. We spent $150 on 2 dinners, no alcohol and dessert, including tip... it was a bummer that it had to end with disappointment. I do, however, look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"I always past by this place on Sahara so I decided to finally try it, been there forever so it must be good. Thankfully it was, if there was a standard for authenticity it would be this place. Felt like I was actually in Japan! I ordered the tiger roll and the sassy roll. The fish is fresh which is the reason why the rolls are so expensive. They do not have AYCE but the rolls are decent. If you are in the mid for AYCE this is not the place you want to go.   Their service is great! The ambiance is amazing also, the tables are set like traditional Japanese tables where you sit on your knees and eat. Now if that's not your thing the table are dug in underneath so you can sit like you are at a normal table. All in all a defined must come/go. Food is good and the service is great!"}
{"text":"I love everything about this place, such as sushi, combination plate, and love the plum wine.  Great customer service and good food"}
{"text":"2 words, JAPANESE LASAGNA!!!!!!! BEST IN TOWN!!!! i love this place, i love the seating and customer service! the sushi has never been bad here and ive always been in a great full mood when we leave."}
{"text":"This place is so delicious! I am a regular & most of the time they all ready know my order, their spicy edamame is to die for. Their service is also great. I enjoy this place a lot, highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Honestly a pretty average Japanese restaurant. Vegas has some great chocked when it comes to this cuisine, some offering outstanding quality while others with great deals and Happy Hours. We came after 10pm to take advantage of the late night menu here, but it was still pretty expensive for rolls. They came out extremely fast however, as if it was cooked in a race. Honestly it was too fast, like we ordered two rolls and less than 5 minutes later we were bested by them. And then our appetizer took a good 20 minutes. So their timing needs to be worked on. They also had hit sake for $5 for late night, but no cold sake which is always very interesting to me. All in all, the sushi was ok, the service was slow to take our order but extremely fast to produce (at least the sushi), and the venue was nicer inside than the area appears. But I would try another great Vegas sushi place instead unless this is simply next on your list."}
{"text":"I can't believe some of the reviews here. \"Not a place to catch up with friends\" ? No, really ? \"I usually eat AYCE crap sushi, I can't believe this place is not what my refined palate expected\". \"I expected a great deal and was shocked at the bill because I don't know how to read a menu\". \"I expected super fancy sushi from my BENTO BOX !\".  Granted, if the place is packed, service can be somewhat slow when you sit a a table (hint: sit at the sushi bar). I have been here many, many times, and have yet to find fault with the quality of product they put out. The layered flavors of the different rolls are better than any other place I've tried in Vegas, and I tried lots.   Try the White Tiger roll, Tokyo Express, Roppongi or Treasure Island, and check the specials board or ask the sushi chef for recommendations."}
{"text":"Fish is not fresh. Best way to find out: try a salmon nigiri... You can tell by the aftertaste. Tastes like freezer burn. The rolls are mediocre.. With really gross sauces on them. The fish is sloppily cut.. Will not go back here, ever again. Osaka's quality has diminished throughout the years. Maybe it's just this location, who knows. The one I used to frequent was the Sahara location. Decided to try again but this location since its closer to my home. Bad move on my part. I wish I would have ordered from Kaizen, or I Love Sushi instead. Blah, Osaka. What a let down."}
{"text":"I'm shocked by the negative reviews... I've been going to this restaurant for over 2 years and I have never had a bad experience. The sushi is always fresh, the service is great and I love the traditional seating. I will agree that the look from the outside and when first entering is a lil sketchy but it also gives it a lil character. This is the go-to spot for a midweek treat. I highly recommend the Omg roll. I crave it monthly."}
{"text":"Came in expecting a 4 star sushi joint ... Coming from the California coast maybe my expectations were too high but ... Cali crunch roll was similar to the sushi at albertsons  which I won't eat ... Veggie tempura so soaked in grease ... Miso soup lacked favor , watery and plain ... Apologized after one bite and maybe half a cup of soup that I can't eat any of this ... And was told to pay for both the tempura and soup ... Highly disappointed and a lesson learned . Blows my mind this place is in business ."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to the HENDERSON LOCATION. So, the other location in Summerlin may be better.   My wife and I ate here as members of a birthday celebration. When the reservations were for 6 people, and 7 showed up, they treated it as if it was a great inconvenience. Prior to being seated for dinner, we had to wait quite a while to get drinks. And even then they were out of a few beers. The waitress was not a bartender by any means. She was confused about the ingredients of basic cocktails.   The manager, who sits at the front door was in no way accommodating or friendly. We did not feel welcomed or comfortable upon our arrival. Perhaps it was the additional member of our party that upset him. We felt as if we were an inconvenience.   That being said, the food was good. We had the combination dinner with steak and seafood. The preparation and presentation were really nice. Our chef was humorous and entertaining. The food was hot and flavorful. The sauces were outstanding.  So, we were happy with the food and unhappy with the hospitality. That being said, we will try it again and hope we our experience will be better. Worth giving it a try!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I've been twice. They have an extensive menu.. tons of rolls... lots of specials (I always opt for their sashimi). Everything is fresh. They have great fresh wasabi too. The prices are so much better than most places in town and they're attentive and super nice. They also offer a cucumber wrapped Rock & Roll roll- if you're watching carbs."}
{"text":"A fun & funky place to bring friends and family!! Every time I step into this restaurant it makes me smile to be seated either on the floor or in one of the sunken booths. There's a great atmosphere shared by all.   I was with some sushi newbies, so we didn't venture out too far meal wise on this visit- although they offer quite the creative mix of rolls. I can't wait to try their Treasure Island - complete with capers and sliced onions and the El Pollo Loco, with chicken, asparagus and Japanese salsa! Say What?! That is my kind of loco!   For this occasion, we ordered: *Spicy tuna - a solid basic *Ribeye wrapped around asparagus - meat was on the tough side, with a flavorful sauce and succulent asparagus. Just an okay dish. *Chicken nuggets - the kiddo and big kiddos chowed down on these little nuggets  *Fresh White roll - My favorite roll of the night! Fresh, juicy albacore with hamachi, shaved radish, cucumber and wrapped in soy pap. It was delicate yet hearty. *Kai's Special roll - had some kick. *Lisa Lisa roll - this was kind of a standard, and our table's favorite. How can one go wrong with shrimp tempura done right?  Service has always been wonderful here, I can't think of one occasion where we didn't receive a greeting, smiles, a quick seat, explanations to questions, help ordering for anyone at the table, quick refills, sake flowing; it's all good. In addition to their funky rolls, they offer Special Boats that are quite a feast to the eyes. If you are looking to make an impression on someone, I'd say that's a sure bet. Then there is the Shabu Shabu, Sukiyaki or Yosenabe to try for yet more adventurous options. Life is good here; Adventure on!!"}
{"text":"This is the oldest Japanese restaurant in Las Vegas.  We came here at the recommendation of DDD.  Not a disappointment at all.  You take off your shoes to sit down...we loved it.  On weekends they are open until 2 am and have a late night menu that is very good and reasonable.  Sushi rolls, tempura shrimp and vegetables, teriyaki chicken all good.  If you have a large group I would recommend reservations.  Be sure to ask for Rudy.  He is the bomb!!  This is a place all must try."}
{"text":"The OMG roll was just that! And the Kamisama roll was great yummo!! Also, the service was professional and courteous. Definitely recommend this one to all foodies and kid-friendly too!"}
{"text":"Went to Osaka tonight for something lighter after a heavy lunch. Chose it as part of a DDD food adventure while in Vegas. Outside is nothing much to look at but inside is quite authentic and the staff, especially Jared, were fantastic. Thought the prices were very reasonable.   Went with a couple of standards as a baseline and a few of Jared's recommendations. Everything was very good but the special cucumber salad, spicy garlic edamame and roppongi roll were top of the list. Delicious. Wish we had more time so we could go back. Might have to skip something else so we can. Thoroughly enjoyed it."}
{"text":"I come here every time I'm in town. It used to be one of the best Sushi places period. Always loved this place and recommended it to friends whenever someone was visiting. Yesterday I went, and for the first time was disappoint. The rolls just aren't as good as they used to be. Way too much rice and not enough fish. Plus the individual pieces were almost falling apart. I'm also not a fan of the fact that out of the four sushi chefs only one is actually Japanese.  What a shame."}
{"text":"This place was decent.  I came here for the first time tonight, I ordered the following: Hot green tea 1/2 911 roll  O.G roll Spicy edamame  Miso soup.  911 roll wasn't spicy like I was hoping but still pretty good, and the OG roll had good flavors but I think mine was burnt because it was tough to chew.  The spicy edamame was undercooked and weird. Couldn't finish it. Miso soup was good, and my green tea never stayed empty for long. I'll come back for non sushi items next time because the sushi is over priced for the quality you're getting. Love the tatami mat sections. The carpet is old and needs to be replaced and the bathroom was pretty much out of soap.  The service was great but the rest was mediocre. I'll try it again though because I want to like it."}
{"text":"Hands down, the absolute BEST Japanese restaurant in Las Vegas! The best sushi I ever had! You can't beat this place. This is what all Japanese restaurants should be measured against. I love this place and can't wait for my next trip to Vegas to go here!"}
{"text":"I ordered a take out of about 4 sushis rolls and they were all delicious ! I had the Crunchy Tako, The White Tiger, The Virgin and the Pollo Loco. The customer service was also delightful, the servers kept on offering me water while waiting for my order. Very nice place !"}
{"text":"I love Osaka for the fact that they bring in fish and food that is not available at popular places across the street: ankimo, amberjack, aji.. And they're true to tradition. The set up is separated into several different eating styles but we always just eat at the sushi bar.   They serve half rolls!  They've got quite a lot of items on the menu and always have a special They have a punch card that gives you back 5% on the card for further use. We've had dinner in just that card several times."}
{"text":"Hamachi Sashimi - Perfect. Tender. Fresh.  Uni Sushi - Very fresh. Not too slimy. Melts in your mouth.  Asakusa Rolls - Spicy tina topped with albacore and scallions, tataki sauce on top - The spice level was good but it was missing that extra kick. The tuna was good..The roll just didn't have anything that stood out.  Osaka Rice - mixture of sushi rice, crab, masago, mayo, sesame oil, and sriracha - Sooooo much yumminess. It's like a comfort food more than anything else. Def try this.  I think it's best to stick with with the fresh sashimi and get some osaka rice to have a good meal."}
{"text":"Came back and tried the king and Queen steak and lobster it was yummy my favorite so far outside of Benihana even better in my opinion because I prefer cute smaller restaurants with good food ;)"}
{"text":"I went into Osaka last night for some late night sushi with my friends. The entrance is kinda creepy, but whatever haha. We were asked if we wanted to sit at the sushi bar or in a japanese room. We chose the room. It was cool because the room is really big and you get cushions to sit on, and you take your shoes off.  That's about the most exciting thing I can say for this place. The service was just alright. There were like 8 people in the whole restaurant and it took them almost an hour to bring 3 sushi rolls. They barely came by to see how we were doing, just seemed like they wanted us to leave.   The rolls were also kind of pricey, even being half off. They were alright, though. The fried banana was really good. I wouldn't come back to this place."}
{"text":"This place has a true japanese feel to it. It is a small, almost divey, place. There is a room for table seating, a room for sitting with the chef as he prepares your meals and a room for good ole Japanese style seating. You remove your shoes and you sit on a pad and down low. We sat here. It was awesome. The initial server that serves you water and drinks and busses your table was a mid-aged white man who spoke very well (very educated) and it was a dismal reality check as to the stake of our economy that this professional has been reduced to busser work. Not that we don't love or need our bussers, they definitely keep the restaurant in order. I couldn't refuse the sushi. I ordered a half roll of the Asakusa (Spicy Tuna Roll topped with Albacore & Scallions) which was close to orgasmic. I ordered a standard yellowtail roll and then I checked out the rest of the entrees and found a Curry Tempura (which does not seem to be on their online menu). It was FANtastic!! Needless to say I left with happy taste buds and a loaded stomach. If I go back to Vegas I will most certainly be visiting here again."}
{"text":"I had a groupon here and i took one of my buddies.  Even though i had the groupon the service was unbelievable.  sometimes when I go out with a groupon, i tend to get unhappy faces with the staff, but at Osaka, the servers were awesome, they were helpful throughout the night, and the food was fantastic.  I am glad to get the groupon because now i know there is a gem of a place nearby my house, I cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"My Favorite sushi place!!! I LOVE these Guy's!!! Andy & Oscar are my favorite sushi bar chefs  I am so addicted I come at least once a week during lunch!!! My favorite is the OH KAMISAMA!! They have lunch specials too! Mmmmm forever a fan!  Updated to add: the whole staff here is great!!"}
{"text":"Osaka offers three ways to dine- the sushi bar, the main dining room, and the tatami room. We went to the Sahara Location.  We had the dragon roll and few other which I don't remember the name. I thought the price was high but the sushi was melt in your mouth good. I noticed they had a special free lobster teppan dinner for your birthday with purchase of 5 teppan dinner. Definitely want to try that out."}
{"text":"1st time here and I must say the Food and Service was GREAT!!!! MO-MO is the best she took care of us.We will be back.."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. What can you say. We had awesome Sashimi and sushi and they were amazing. It was to awesome ! Good size portions and good Saki too.  Hence the 5 stars VS - 5. PS: No hot towels and no edamame and no orange with plum wine like the good old days gift. Enjoy !"}
{"text":"Wow. Seriously? Why is this not at my house? We have excellent Japanese in CA but... Not like this.  So much variety on the menu. If you know Japanese food and ingredients, you will absolutely love this place. The appetizers we enjoyed were a full Roppongi roll and an okonomi yaki. Yes. They offer happy delicious comfort pancake happiness.   The main dish for lunch was a 777 roll, a chicken bowl and a Churashi bowl that's to. Die. For.  I am not a Vegas fan. I am an Osaka fan. I need an airplane. Stat."}
{"text":"We've eaten here several times since my last post and everything has been really good. When we've eaten with the live chef, he's always been extra attentive to our 3yo son. The food is still a little expensive and I've stopped asking for brown rice because they charge so much for it. Otherwise, the food it good and the take out is prepared quickly and the location is convenient for us."}
{"text":"This place is extremely cute! It was our first time there and we were seated at a \"booth.\" It's the kind of place where you take off your shoes and eat. It made me feel like I was at a real restaurant in Japan. They're opened until 2 AM so my boyfriend and I came for their happy hour. They have a huge selection and we ordered a few rolls. Just FYI the happy hour rolls are smaller than their regular rolls. It was tasty and the food was fresh."}
{"text":"Got suckered by DDD and gave this place a try...  Featured as the very first sushi place in LV..   I should've known better than to expect fresh sushi in a desert or trust Guy's pitch for Sushi on a show featuring Dives.. Buffet quality fish both cooked/raw Rice to fish ratio sucked.. Same on rolls.. Gave it one more star as I know Its hard to please LA pallets on asian food out of state."}
{"text":"Another nightmare of a restaurant, perfect for those that think that a California Roll (poorly made) is the height of Japanese cuisine.  Rumor is that Yukio Mishima ate here before deciding to kill himself.  1. Ambience: When you first walk in, you think \"hey, instead of the pretentious bs overpriced Vegas Hotel Japanese restaurant scene, I may have found one of those amazing hole-in-the-wall spots that will be a great authentic experience\"...well, the hole-in-the-wall is right, and in this case, it is just that.   The restaurant is old, dilapidated, and damn confusing to escape from. But if you check it out thoroughly, you can almost smell (um and smell other things to) that this was once a great, great place. It looks like the shell of a restaurant taken over by someone's kid or run by an owner who no longer cares whether he has a customer or not. Perhaps his dog died and he's depressed. Perhaps the dog is one of the menu items.   In fact, when we were there, there were about 4 people in a space that could seat at least 100 or more I would think.  Then there are the prostitutes and what not that like to stop by for their pick up orders. Not the restaurant's fault but certainly, this is an inviting atmosphere for them. Funny part is that they got better service then we did.  2. Service: haahaha! What? What's service? Um. Not on the menu.  Yah, so we sat in front of the most disinterested Japanese sushi chef I have ever experienced outside of wacko Nozawa in LA. But Nozawa is at least an actor. This momo was for real. Rude attitude. Totally didn't give a shit that we were the only customers at the bar, or basically in the restaurant. He was busy in his own world. And then of course, there is the attitude driven little Yakuza wanabee waitress who looks like she needs to focus more on the Hello Kitty art on her nails, then bother with a customer.  When we asked in advance if a certain item was cooked a certain way, and were given incorrect information, they still hesitated, and gave us attitude about taking it back! I mean, we asked in advance! But its our fault that they deep fry what in any normal restaurant is grilled. Oh I speak of YAKITORI. Yes. They deep fry it here so that it has a wonderful brick like consistency. Yum. I guess they didn't read the definition of yakitori, like the part about the \"grilling\" aspect.  Oh, and when we said our \"itadakimasu\" and upon any \"thank you\" to the chef...pin drop...no response. Oh man, he looked annoyed and pissed the entire excruciating meal! Wanted to get my tanto blade from the car and go Watari Tetsuya on his ass but I was more in a Totoro mood. Or maybe Golgo 13. Yes I speak Otaku.  On top of that, no one comes by to see if we need anything. Have to call out for the waitress for water, a plate, a gun, whatever.  3. Food.  This is simple. Gross. Lousy quality fish. Even the salmon was 12th grade. And that is cheap fish to do right. And don't think you can escape into Rolls and Handrolls. You can't. Because they are as bad as everything else. Drenched in sauce to make up for the disgusting taste.  All together...125 dollars and no \"thank you\" from the retards that run this place. Not impressed is an understatement.   I challenge you to try OSAKA and experience the disaster that spots like Nobu made possible. So now you have two choices in Vegas. Authentic -Fake Disgusting Overpriced and Authentic-Fake OK Overpriced. Either way, there is no Japanese food other than Ichiza and Raku in Vegas. Actually, there is no Japanese food in Vegas. Cause those two options are like McDonalds in Tokyo.   Instead, find a hot Japanese girl or guy, get your Tanto blade, and threaten them to make you a proper dinner. Make sure to check your salmon for parasites, and in the case of Osaka, the chef as well.  P.S. I feel like I may have gone a little over-board in this review and so I apologize to anyone who's feelings I may have hurt, like the a-hole chef who stole 125 dollars out from our wallets and in return gave us horrible service and food."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorite restaurants! The food is good (decent selection from r Vegan/Vegetarian considering it's a sushi place)  & it's a great location. My favorite thing about this place is definitely the customer service!! My fiancé & I come here all the time, and we have never once had a bad experience!"}
{"text":"The Sushi was delicious and the chefs were fun to talk to. We get there at 1am and were not rushed to leave at 2."}
{"text":"Came in a couple nights ago at like 1am which was great, some of the best sushi ive had in along time. Thanks!"}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure that the people who gave this place five stars are related to the owners and therefore get better portions and deals. While I can't say the food was bad it was a complete rip off...I paid 100 for two king and queen plates (celebratory dinner for my bfs bday) the plates consist of a lobster tail and filet mignon with grilled veggies.   The lobster was probably considered a midget given the tail size and the lobster meat had been removed and cut up and replaced in the tail where I'm sure we got smaller portions than what was initially in the tail. I mean the amount of lobster was so little I'm pretty sure they took one lobster tail cut it up cooked up and grabbed an empty tail to split it up in two portions.   Similarly when ordering they ask how you want your filet mignon cooked however it is a useless question because they cut it up in little pieces!!! I don't know about you but I don't need help cutting up my meat I'm not a five year old, needless to say the small chunks were all very well done and again it was a very small portion.   You would think that at the very least they wouldn't skimp on the mixed veggies since its not a high cost item but they must be on a small budget because it was not substantial. I guess they get bargain prices on rice because we got a ton of that even though neither of us eat rice.   The food didnt taste bad though and they had nice sauces to dip your minitature meat portions into. At the end we were both left hungry and ended up getting capriottis later that night (bomb sub place that I definitely recommend) and was left feeling robbed especially after getting a better tasting and filling meal for like a quarter of the price.   Definitely not a good place to go unless your super rich and therefore don't mind getting ripped off. That's what I get for trying to avoid the fancy restaurants on the strip to get a good deal."}
{"text":"Osaka is the place to check for sure in while in Vegas!! We had our wedding meet & greet family dinner here and boy was it one amazing experience we will never forget! The food & the customer service was unbelievably AMAZING!!! Manager David & staff treated us like family! We will definitely visit here every time we come!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for many years....  Our family prefers TEPPANYAKI and there are many varieties -combinations to choose from. Quick service and very clean. Quality is good, my husband always orders sushi too and he's never complained. Do recommend it for family gatherings with children, as the chef always \"performs\" while cooking and it is entertaining as well."}
{"text":"One of my favorites places for sushi! It's definitely a dive and it's been there forever but the service and quality is top notch.  My favorite rolls are the Pocket Aces and the Fresh White, but any of the others are great too. The place has recently been seen some minor remodeling such as the carpet and walls of the sushi bar. Size of rolls isn't always consistent, just depends on sushi chef."}
{"text":"Loved it,small intimate, food very good, desert nummy!"}
{"text":"Always fresh food. Seafood salad is great and must try their scallop dishes!  Another place I go every time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"It seems a bit harsh to only give osaka two stars but i have to rate it like i tasted it. It was my first visit to osaka having typically only dined at ayce sushi restaurants. I had high hopes considering all of the great reviews i had read. I have to say I was extremely dissappointed! Not only was the sushi just so-so, I ended up spending way more money than I would have at any of the ayce places i frequent.   I would have been okay spending the 36 bucks for two rolls and a hand roll if the rolls themselves were delicious. But that was not the case.  My friend ordered the oh my god roll which was decent. As a whole the meal was not up to par. For those people that believe you get better quality from the restaurants that don't have ayce, think again. This place is a perfect example of the opposite.  I'll stick with places like Oyshi and sushi mon.   Clearly more money doesn't always equal better quality."}
{"text":"I normally stop by Osaka on my way home from work to get soup and a small appetizer but I happened to be off for the evening. I placed my order for pick up and as I pulled into the lot a lady was sitting on the curb approached me.   She was someone who probably doesn't get a meal as frequently as most and quietly asked me if I could give her my leftovers after dinner and didn't want any money.   I went into the restaurant to get my soup and half of a sushi roll and asked the server if I could leave money for the lady outside so she could pick her meal and actually be able to sit down and eat it. A bald man who was another server chimed in and was like no you can't do that, she'll bother other customers, that's what they usually do. It's better if you get her something to go.   I will not be returning to Osaka. That man had no humanity or compassion in him. If that's the type of people that work there, my business is not needed. A real sit down meal was all I wanted to provide for someone. Whoever that server was should be ashamed. If you can't help humankind there is no hope."}
{"text":"This is one of those places that only the locals know about. Best quality Sushi in town!!"}
{"text":"The sushi chef was great but he was SUPER busy clearly preparing a huge platter and we had a hard time getting his attention to serve us. The sushi was awesome. But we wanted other items from the menu and had to tell the sushi chef because the waitress NEVER came back. Even after she delivered my husband's dish, she NEVER returned :( For as good of reviews as this place has, we expected better service or even a little bit of service. The entrance is also confusing. Which way do you go in? There needs to be some signage in the weird hallway that you enter. I'd try some where else next time we're here."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge sushi fan but I'd definitely come back here. All the food was extremely fresh and tasty. The prices were a little steep but what good sushi place doesn't charge a little more? We had the Oh My God roll, Roppongi roll, 911 roll, Lychee Sake, Miso Soup, and Unagi. All were great except the unagi in my opinion but I'm not a fan. Everyone else most definitely enjoyed it.  The service was good. Nothing out of this world but our server came back and checked on us a few times throughout the meal and did her job.   Overall, I'd really give Osaka a 3.5 because of the prices and mediocre service."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Kinda pricey but its really really good. They do not have ayce(all you can eat.) its per order, the quality of the food is Amazing. The staff is very friendly and helpful on selecting food. I would definitely recommend this place if you love sushi!."}
{"text":"I ordered for delivery from EAT24 and let me tell you what a big disappointment! First of all the 8.99$ charge, come on you guys i live only 2miles away.. Second of all food arrived 1 hour and 45 min after i placed the order (i live only 2 miles away from the restaurant). Third of all but not last, i guess delivery driver never checked my order cause on top of that i had missing items.. I would not recommend this restaurant to non of my friends or the delivery service that is taking their orders... slow, incorrect, bad experience!!"}
{"text":"While the sushi in this spot doesn't hold a candle to I Love Sushi or Sushi Fever, the service and half rolls make up for it overall. I consistently have a great service experience here and have never had to wait for a table. Plus, there is very little bullsh$t at the sushi bar which is sometimes appreciated on a \"school\" night. The Hibachi is another story altogether, it is a tasty affair and the shrimp dish is some of the best I've ever had! Most certainly worth a visit!"}
{"text":"This is the best sushi restaurant in town. We had the omakase (chef's choice) and had his specialties. The sashimi here is really fresh and tasty. The prices overall on the  menu was very reasonable. The cost on the omakase is really up to you. We told him $80/person and we had over 10 dishes. (2 of which had toro) You can always set this lower and order more later if you're still hungry.   They do have coupons available. Check online or in the local advertisements."}
{"text":"Sushi and Tapan. We began with Sushi Rolls. All fresh and very tasty. Next was the Tapan table. Great chef. Did the usual show with the flying spatulas and the famous Egg Roll. The food was delicious and the service was excellent as well. As soon as someone's drink was nearly empty, our servers were all over it. This is a do over next time I'm in Vegas"}
{"text":"Awesome experience, awesome service, awesome food! My best friend came in from Dallas and we both love Benihana's of Japan and decided to give Osaka's a try. Oh my gosh it was more than we were expecting and much more food than we are used to. Let's just say we had Osaka's for lunch at home the next day. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Definitely an experience. Not totally impressed by wait staff but the selection is why we were there. Good for a first date. Quiet and relaxing. I'd come back anytime. It doesn't compare to my favorite sushi spot but I won't hate."}
{"text":"Huge variety. Rolls were delish. Loved having the option of a half roll. Was able to get multiple rolls. Get the spicy garlic edemome- amazing!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Extremely good service. Awesome happy hour prices. Most sushi rolls are 4-9 dollars for 12-2. This place might have gotten me hooked on sushi and I dont think I want to settle for anything less. Only reason Im giving 4 stars is because I ordered some weird sushi. Nothing against the restaurant. I just didnt know what I was ordering. Some of the sushi is served hot and I did not know that from just looking at the menu. Other than that this place is awesome. ALSO! I did not try dessert here but they have tempura ice cream and fried oreos and cheesecake here!!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is great for  food. It's absolutely delicious. The teriyaki chicken and the shrimp lovers combination. The flavors and the presentation is great. Mireya service was outstanding and from everyone else too ruby etc. Great place to eat and enjoy"}
{"text":"This Osaka has some of the freshest sashimi in town. I had the Toro last night and it melted in my mouth. The service was great as well. This is one of my go to sushi spots whenever I'm in town."}
{"text":"Usually eat at the Osaka on W Sahara, but I love the idea of live music. Most Sushi places are into crazy Japanese dance music or some rap/R&B. Osaka plays jazz, it is such a cool chilled vibe. I want to linger and drink. Other sushi places make me feel like I need to be grinding up against the sushi chef and slip dollar bills in the hostesses bra. One bit of disclosure, the murals of the jazz artists, on the wall, were done by a friend of mine. Must visit. AYCE? No. Fresh fish? Yes!"}
{"text":"We took a table in the Tatami Room. I would highly recommend sitting there instead of at a regular table. Where do I begin?? The menu is a notebook of options! Take your time here and don't be in a rush so you can savor the flavors. Check out the pictures and they will speak volumes!   There is a picture of a bowl of fish. There was a plethora of fish...from mackerel to tuna to salmon to shrimp. There were so many varieties. You can share this meal.   They make all of their own sauces. The eel sauce is amazing! And do not pass up dessert...ask for their Fried Tempura Oreo! We won't need to eat for weeks!  So far...this is the best place we've eaten in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Just as mentioned by other yelpers the layout is really weird.. Upon entering it's a immediately hallway directing you to go right, you would think once you enter the actual \"restaurant\" it would be one big open space, but you walk into another room where I think the sushi bar was and a few other tables. The rest of the restaurant is divided into rooms.. We had visitors from Canada with us and I almost felt embarrassed we took them to a odd restaurant such as this in a sketchyarea. We came on a Saturday afternoon as a party of 9. The major plus is that they offer their lunch specials 7 days a week, which is good considering other restaurants only offer deals on the weekdays. I ordered the bento \"b\" with chicken katsu as my main entree ($10). In addition, I ordered a tiger roll, made up of 4 pieces for $8. The bento included miso soup, gyoza, tempura, a tossed salad, and 2 pieces of CA roll. Everything was pretty standard, except the CA roll seemed a little heavy on the rice and less on the crab meat. I enjoyed the tiger roll and have nothing to complain about it. The piece used for the chicken was rather thin, but still a good size. And the tempura, was good because the batter was light and not overly greasy. The service was good for the most part as they refilled our waters regularly and were attentive to us. Nothing really stuck out to me and I don't live around here so I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Excellent service, enjoyed the teppan grill. Our cook was a young guy they call him \"white boy\". Very talented with his skills for being so young, you would think it takes years of practice but he's got it down. If you go there ask for him. Just sit back away from the grill b/c he doesn't give warning when he makes a big ass bonfire in your face, thought I lost my eyebrows...j/k. Food is good, will come again"}
{"text":"First of all, we waited at least 15 mins to be seated when it's 930pm. Not many people in the restaurant. The waitress eat in the kitchen when we walked pass the open area connected to the kitchen. Lots of TRASH on the floor back in the kitchen hallway. There was an older chef George who was cooking for us. During the chitchat, he told us he had too much sake tonight. How can employee drink during work??? We ordered 4 fried rice. He made 6 bowls and asked a waiter takes two away, George said \"one for you, one for so on so\". George insist me to open my mouth to catch the food he threw. I refused a few times then he started yelling at me and force me to do it which already give me an unpleasant experience. I said no and started eating my food but shockingly he threw the vege on my head. He was EXTREMELY DISRESPECTFUL to the customer and he kept arguing with me after throwing the food on my head. This is unbelievable. I have never had this kind of HORRIBLE experience in a restaurant. Will NEVER come back. DO NOT go to this place if you want to be treated properly and keep your appetite and don't GET SICK.  The waiter who took the rice George made from our table laughed to another waiter when he was cleaning the table next to us. He said the guests were so stupid left the whole salmon on the table.  When the boss is gone in the restaurant, EMPLOYEES DRINK and EAT WHEN THEY ARE WORKING, no one does the work. BAD HYGIENE. This is NOT PROFESSIONAL at all. This restaurant needs to hire professionals or provide basic training to the bumbs they hire.   This is the first yelp review I wrote. I normally don't want to spend time on tiny things like this but I want to let the public know and don't pay for the shitty service. The customers deserve much better especially when you pay over $50 a dish."}
{"text":"Probably the most unimpressive entrance to a surprise find in Las Vegas for traditional Japanese fare. Tempting menu options, made for hard decisions. Our selections did not disappoint."}
{"text":"In Vegas for a car show and wanted Sushi....so glad we came here. Food and service were excellent. Kalbi Ribs were beyond excellent. Highly recommend Osaka."}
{"text":"im a big sushi fan n i got to say out of alot of place ive tried in vegas this is surely one of the BEST!!! they got amazing happy hour!..the waiters are very nice n friendly i prob come here every two weeks n they know me n my orders lol...this place is very chill n there booths are what japanese style so u take your shoes off but i really recomend coming here n tryin a few of there amazing sushi rolls!!!!!"}
{"text":"This was my very first time here, with a $20 off coupon for an order of $80 or more.   When you arrive, the door is crazy hard to open with their air vent system. And very cold inside as a result.  We had a reservation for 6:30 on a Friday, which was smart because it was packed. The older Asian gentleman who seemed to be a host was very curt and sat us in a half-booth half-table when we had wanted a full booth but luckily my guests were not picky about seating.  We were given drinks right away and placed an order for tempura bam, which took twenty minutes to arrive and we noticed other tables void of food like ours as well. They seem to be short-staffed for the weekend dinner rush, something for the owners to look into.  When it finally arrived, it was disheartening at best due to how small the portion suez is to the price. Being a la carte instead of AYCE, I expected much more bang for my buck. Add to that I ordered a less cooked Alaskan Box that other guests preferred the tempura bam over so sharing was difficult when we were so hungry and waited so long. The Alaskan Box (tobiko fish egg, salmon, rice in square cut w/o seaweed) was stunning to look at but quite bland, with the cucumber being too overwhelming for my taste.  Knowing this, we ordered four rolls: Shrimp Tempura, West Vegas, U-My, and the one with hamachi. I guess I did not order the right items because each one had something off and fulfilling about it.   I know Osaka is meant to be one of the more premium bistros but I was not too impressed. Perhaps if I have another coupon and a chance to order different things I will return. The main highlight was our server, very vivacious lady who took the time to explain menu items and the Japanese language behind them. Also as we left there was live piano, very rare these days unless you dine on the Strip."}
{"text":"Everything we had was so tasty and delish! The servers and sushi chefs were all very nice. Great Sushi spot"}
{"text":"Was really looking forward to experience the taste of the food again that I remember from my last trip to Las Vegas.  I was very disappointed in the quality of the food this time around.  Portions were ok though.  The nori used for the sushi rolls was very bad because we spent more time chewing on the nori.  The quality of the nori was just not there.  I love to eat sushi and don't think that I will return to this restaurant in my future trips to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is great for a sushi night ! It can be a bit pricey and the sushi is kind of smaller than the average sized sushi but the quality of the sushi is just amazing makes up for it  so it's well worth the price!"}
{"text":"We used to come here a lot but the last few times we were there, the service was really slow so we've stopped coming. Aside from the service, the food was good. They have unique tables that are inset into the floor, so you take off your shoes before sitting & you step down into the booth seat. The parking lot is really small so we often had to park in the lot next door."}
{"text":"Thank you Guy Fieri! We were looking for a great local place to eat off the strip while on vacation in Las Vegas and checked the list on the triple D website. I am so glad we did! Osaka is almost like 3 different restaurants in one: a sushi bar, teppanyaki grill and Japanese restaurant. It is located way off the strip in a strip mall. We ate in the Japanese restaurant section that has low tables that you take your shoes off and tuck your feet under. Super fun! We ordered several sushi rolls, firecracker shrimp, miso soup and their house chicken soup. Everything was amazing! We got the Roponngi, Pocket Aces, and Kai Special rolls. My favorite was the Pocket Aces with the crunchy fried onions on top- yum! The rolls weren't super inexpensive but they were big and really fresh. Next time I'll come for happy hour. I'm so glad we tried this place. It's worth the Uber ride."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious.  Had the ocean delight-wonderful.  The best service.  Enjoyed greatly."}
{"text":"I have only come here during their happy hour per se (10pm-2am) and I or we sit at the bar.  The chefs are great and quick, the items on the late night special menu are plentiful and cheap.  The rolls are half though.  One of the dishes I ordered was the scallops, the quality of the scallops was great.  They have sake and beer on the menu too and it is affordable.  I can never drink whenever I come though.  One day I'll be able to come on a normal day and use one of those cool rooms where you sit on the floor without your shoes!  Until then, this place is definitely worth trying out.  Service (not the chefs) at the bar was ehhh.."}
{"text":"Love this place. Best sushi in town IMO. Everybody I have taken here has loved the food. Very fresh and clean (means a lot coming from a germ freak). Lunch specials are the best!"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints!  Go see Julio, John, Ray or Armando and you will love it! Best fresh fish in town.  If you like hipster rolls this might not be your place but if you like fresh fish nigiri style or sashimi there isn't a better place!"}
{"text":"Osaka is many good things:  1. a sushi restaurant with a wide variety of fish. When you go into most neighborhood sushi joints, they have the chalkboard specials. Unfortunately, whenever I ask for the more high-end stuff off the chalkboard, NOBODY has it! One waiter at a not-to-be-named sushi joint actually laughed when I asked for the Bluefin. I said, \"it's on the specials,\" and he said, \"oh, we never have that.\" (?!?) Not so at Osaka! Just last night I was offered Bluefin, otoro, and chutoro (sp?). We had the bluefine and the cheaper of the toros (can't remember which). Both were delish!  2. A great sake bar. Seriously, I bet they have 40 different sakes on their menu, one to fit every price point. We had a $19 bottle of cold \"mountain man\" last night. Good not great, but I like trying things out.  3. A reasonably-priced teppanyaki joint. The chefs do all the standbys (smiley face, fire, peeing man to put out the fire, onion volcano, etc etc....) which my 2 year old loved! It's at least 2 meals worth and they have all kinds of options. I got the chicken ($19), and my husband had the NY and lobster ($35, I think).  4. A tatami room. Actually, I have no idea what that is or what they serve, but I see people taking off their shoes to sit there.  5. In my neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Forget the Strip or Fremont, Sahara Ave has everything!   Based on all of the reviews, people seem to either love Osaka or hate it. I love the place. I never had sushi before I tried Osaka and now I'm addicted. Since I'm not expert, I'll keep it short.  Why i love the place: -Eat the volcano roll. it's the most delicious food item I've even tasted in my life. - the rolls all come in half or whole, so you can order lots of different rolls and share. - the place is affordable. -The flat screen tvs at each booth have a looping slide show of everything that they sell in the place. if your conversation falls off, you can drool at the tvs."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for.  That's my motto when it comes to Osaka.  One of the few places that serve 1/2 rolls which is a plus.  Price is another plus (one of the cheapest in town).  Quality is not the best, but not the worst.    My friends tell me that this place has the freshest sushi. I think my issue is because I frequent this place only during the late nights. I think the earliest I've been here was 11 PM. I don't think it's the freshest, but again probably because I come so late.   Service is good and I can't complain about that.  With a ton of sushi restaurants in Vegas, this place gets only 3 stars from me.  Btw, don't get their calamari either.  Pretty much a fried mistake."}
{"text":"This place is so good. The service was amazing. The cooks made everything very fast. And they also offer breakfast that looks amazing ! And I've never even seen a Japanese restaurant offer breakfast !  The shrimp Shumai was my favorite ! Definitely will be coming back here especially since it's very hard to find amazing shumai that's not always sold out. Will be coming here as much as I possibly can"}
{"text":"OMG!!Not only is this really authentic Japanese food, they also deliver it direct to your hotel room. Cannot believe my luck that I found Okonimiyaki in Vegas AND didn't even have to leave the comfort of my room to enjoy it"}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat the best delicious sushi!!! I absolutely love this place! Everything is always fresh. The service is very attentive to your need & the sushi chefs are awesome. Atmosphere is very chill & relaxed. They have it all, delicious desserts, delicious everything! Definitely a Must try!!!"}
{"text":"I love coming here. Amazing sushi. But best of all its fried rice is like no other. I'm not a big sushi fan I don't order anything but crab, shrimp and salmon but I must say its very good here."}
{"text":"Found this restaurant a few years ago when I moved to this area of town. I'm glad to have found a Japanese restaurant actually owned by Japanese! Most of the Japanese places here in Vegas are run by Koreans, which I can't complain about, but I like the authenticity of REAL Japanese food like my mom makes! :) Osaka was also the first Japanese owned restaurant in Vegas!  I love the late night menu. Since Osaka is open until 2am and I'm up late, it works perfect for me! The late night menu is large with great prices! Half size/priced suchi rolls, low priced apps, and great drink specials as well!   Some of my favorite items are: udon, zaru soba, shabu shabu, katsudon, katsu kare, and their selection of fish! Their soups and sauces are very good and similar to how my mom makes!  The sushi chefs are very nice, friendly and Japanese. They are great at recommending menu items and love how creative they are.   They feature teppanyaki (table grilling) and tatami tables by request and live music certain days of the week."}
{"text":"I loved it. Sat down at the sushi bar and right away got greeted and asked what i like to drink. Very attentive and quick with the food. Food was delicious, fresh and just yummy. I will most definitely be going back if I'm ever in Vegas again. Oooh and asked for a roll that wasn't on the menu and with no hesitation he agreed to make it for me which I loved. Thank u!!! Ooh and lunch prices were just right."}
{"text":"Honestly, I expected more from this establishment. Maybe it was just my visit (it was my first), but first impressions are everything for me.  Service is great here, comfortable atmosphere and theme. We sat at the tappan tables... It felt like there was no air conditioning in that back room. I ordered Japanese scallop sushi when i ordered my drink because I love it, it was very good! The other sushi rolls we had were pretty good, interesting custom rolls. I got the chicken and filet mignon habachi and shared with my wife. Chicken and steak were average for upper medium scale Japanese bistro, but they completely lost me with the sauces. Call me traditional, but I like a ginger vinaigrette and yum yum sauce, they serve some strange tasting sauce that is an awful yum yum imposter next to an OKAY ginger sauce. When I asked for some yum yum sauce, it was basically Japanese mayo with a tad bit of sweet something. Not the yum yum I was hoping for. Like I said, the sauces are make or break for me.  If you want REAL amazing habachi, place downtown called Mosashi (sp?) Tiger is the owner and a chef and the food, sauces and service are superb. No wonder when we always go there somone famous is dining with us.   All in all, I would not revisit this restaurant unless I had a 50% coupon and a free pedicure."}
{"text":"I think this place is great!! It's in a good location but since it's not on the strip the prices are average. Very awesome chicken katsu. Also sampled a few other items they had (forgot the names, but they were all good.) The food itself would only get a 3 star rating but the fact they have four different seating options is not only unique but sure to please almost anybody. Plus, our server was very friendly. If you're craving sushi this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Great place to dine with family and friends at both of Osaka's teppanyaki and seated areas.  Prices are reasonable and they have friendly service."}
{"text":"I've been here many times during the years and it's an okay place. Everything they serve is simply average nothing really that stands out, but it's still decent.  Most of the time the service is friendly and delivery of food is accurate and quickly delivered. I like this location, because it's closer to the center of town, so if I'm running out of time I can come here for a quick bite. This isn't the best sushi place in town, but it's good enough to recommend."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas and it has been that way going on 10 years.  Its got a real neighborhood feel too it.  Food is always fresh and service is super polite and prompt.  I just love to go there after work and take off my shoes and lounge around on the pillows.  I recommend the chicken teriyaki, tempura shrimp and veggies and Japanese sandwiches."}
{"text":"Got food poisoning here yesterday. What a terrible post meal experience.. can't ever come here again. At the time, the food was an overall good meal, however I started the worst food sickness about 3-5 hours later. This, I will never forget. Culprit is the ginger, rice or filet tataki (not sure on sp)."}
{"text":"Exceptional sushi!  Exceptional!  I'm sure the experience is even better if I eat in but I always take it to go. I called in my order and when I got there to pick up, I had the great pleasure of watching the sushi master lovingly preparing my dish. Atmosphere and staff are wonderful. Some evenings, there's even a live band performing. Great place to dine!"}
{"text":"I feel I need to share one of my favorite sushi restaurants from Vegas. This is an off strip restaurant that is pretty popular with the Nevada locals. The location of Sahara is the most popular one, but this location is smaller and more quaint. The one on Eastern Blvd in Henderson is the one that I like to go to because this is where the best sushi chef in Vegas works. If Hiro is working, he will make things you never heard of that might not even be served anywhere else!  Some of my favorites are the Beef Tataki with crispy garlic slices on top, Escolar with fresh jalapeños, rock shrimp salad, the Chilean Sea Bass appetizer. Honestly, anything he makes will be fantastic, guaranteed! I believe he's usually off on Wednesdays and Thursdays and works evenings, but if you treat him well, he'll do the same! For those not into sushi, they have the Teppan room and also a full menu outside of sushi. They even have the tatami mats at both locations. They serve free hot sake between 4-7pm and Monday Night Football pitchers of beer during happy hour.   If you are a local, they have a frequent visitor card that gets you money off after you spend a certain amount, otherwise if you visit their website, you can download a one time 10% off coupon. Hope you have fun!"}
{"text":"Food is GREAT, but every time I come in it takes forever for someone to greet me. I stood in the doorway this time waiting for someone to approach me, made eye contact with a chef that was talking with two different waiters. I approached them after waiting 3-4 minutes, and still nobody said anything to me. I had to go find another waiter walking around to help me.. I find it very offensive that this happens almost every time I come in to pick up an order. Very unprofessional. I am not one to complain but they definitely need a host up front at the desk by the door. I've never seen anyone behind that desk and I'm here quite often."}
{"text":"This is the place that made me a believer!  I have always been leary of sushi, but after my experience here I love it now.  Not been to a ton of places, but this is the place I base all others on.  And none have come close.  I can't get enough of the 911 roll.  And everyone I have told about this place all agree this place is tops.  Also you can't beat there sushi happy hour and the ambiance all in all Osaka is great."}
{"text":"Went to Osaka again today. This place has been in Las Vegas longer than I have, like 48+ years !! Their food is consistently fresh, the fish tastes like fresh caught, just like it should ! Great Service and quality food make Osaka on West Sahara a true Las Vegas treasure !"}
{"text":"Been hitting up Osaka Henderson for over 10 years now!  You won't find a much bigger menu, it's rediculous.  This is my dependable go-to japanese that never does me wrong.  My faves:  -Kickass Tempura  -Salmon Sashimi is always on point! -Teppan Grill is TOPS -BOMB house chicken soup -Not a big roll guy, so I can't comment on that.  Can be a little pricey, especially for you \"all you can shove\" lovers.  Staff is super friendly.  Worst part of the restaurant is the strange wind vacuum opening the front door."}
{"text":"Great service, all the rolls I tried were amazing. Some of the best sushi I've ever had. Good sake selection. Would come back.   However, sitting at the sushi bar sucks: the countertop is so shallow that your knees clash with the wall beneath the counter. Could not find a comfortable seating position."}
{"text":"This restaurant is wonderful! It is lovely inside. The decor is beautiful and clean. The staff is very friendly and the sushi is fresh and very well prepared!   They also have bento boxes for those who aren't into sushi, which are among the best I've seen. They aren't stingy with the plates and everything is fresh and flavorful! I have been back several times over the past few weeks and they are consistent.   I would recommend this restaurant to anyone without worrying about it missing the mark. Bravo!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Like what everyone is saying about the layout is kinda weird but still great ambiance, once you get to the Japanese seating area. And the place has plenty of seating even great for parties or dinner events.  Plus if you go on Groupon you get some kind of discount but I think its only for the anthem location.   Customer service is pretty good. They even gave us a little history about Osaka. How the owner was a great guy. He wanted to help people with no work so he opened a restaurant. There is a painting of him in the sushi bar. Also found out that they are NOT associated with the Lake Mead location.   The food is amazing! I mean your never gonna get it as fresh as Japan but taste is on point. Kinda brings me back to Japan.  It is a little pricey but totally worth it specially  on happy hour! I love love the tempura bam.  The curry is pretty good as well and is a big portion. And of course the sushi! I definitely recommend this place. It doesn't look much considering the location. But its a  MUST TRY!"}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh seafood!  Outstanding service!  We came in on a Tuesday afternoon and did not have to wait to be seated to have sushi only."}
{"text":"This restaurant  is so weird. I made a reservation but  they said they dont take reservation from 4-8pm ...just after 8pm  for night . We are fine with that . that is why we take 8pm with show cooking on table...but when we come on time, they don't put us on  that table instead other one. They said we need to wait for 30mis. We are ok...but after that they said we need to wait more time... so bad. We take reservation already. Why we need to wait many time. We spend 30mins for driving to this restaurant...but it is tooooooo....o bad.  I don't eat food yet so i give this restaurant 2 stars for bad treatment."}
{"text":"Another excellent Teppanyaki experience at the Henderson location. Oddly our Chef is a white guy (Zack) that cooks a hell of a lot better than any of the other Asian or Hispanic Chefs I've had in the past(Not to be racist here) and I eat a lot of Teppanyaki . He is just that good and the food is awesome. He will adjust your meal according to your liking and we are always left extra fried rice and steak to your liking. We've had the Filet Mignon, the Tiger Shrip which are huge and the Salmon which was also huge. All in all, this is hands down one of the best places to eat. Sorry, I don't each Sushi, so I can't speake to that..."}
{"text":"Great 911 roll if you like spicy. The oh my god roll is very tasty too. THe interior is very Japanese like, low floor tables and bamboo, nice atmosphere, friendly service"}
{"text":"Osaka is hands down the best Japanese restaurant in the Las Vegas area. I always try to leave The Strip to get a more mellow, authentic experience and this place is my first pick. Fresh sushi, a large menu, great service, fair pricing and tasty specials all make this place the go-to when in Vegas."}
{"text":"Osaka is great! I am not sure how it can get any less than 4 stars. Its a local's staple for good reason. I have personally been patronizing Osaka (sahara and eastern) for 14 years. I have NEVER had a bad meal, food is always consistent and service has always been wonderful.   Not only do they have an extensive sushi menu, great lunch specials, amazing Teppanyaki chefs, a rewards card, live music but they are open late too! Osaka will always have a spot in my foodie heart!"}
{"text":"It's a must to stop into Osaka anytime I'm in Vegas!   Service is great, food's yummy and there's many options, and I love the vibe in the restaurant! I can lounge and sip on sake or do sake bombs with help from the chefs!"}
{"text":"The quality of fish here was great, we also got some yakitori that unfortunately was all dry and overcooked.  Also got the fried oysters, they were fresh but also over fried. The entrees were so-so, everything seemed extra salty. There's no doubt that their ingredients are of good quality, but if I were to do it all over again I would stay away from the appetizers and entrees and just order sushi straight up. If you are into Uni and Ikura, definitely get their Awesome Threesome. Service was friendly and fast, water cups were never empty. Waitress was very knowledgeable of their huge several page menu."}
{"text":"Came here to try this place on a Wednesday night. We wanted to sit in those booths that you take your shoes off Japanese style. I love this concept. Only thing I would have to say is that the pillows to sit on in this room is kinda old. Some looked new but some were old or dirty. Our servers did an excellent job bringing out everything fast and tending to us. My boyfriend and I ordered the Ron Special Boat. It was filling and good. Didn't care for the potato salad that came with the boat. Everything else was good. The sauce for the tempura was my boyfriends favorite sauce. Before we got our boat we got a refreshing cucumber salad and the miso soup with noodles in it. I love that their soup has noodles in it! It was delicious. The cucumber salad was really good and part of my favorite as well! I also ordered some hot sake. It was smooth and the server did a great job recommending the sake choice for me.  Our Ron special boat had beef, chicken yakitori, came with rice, potato salad, sashimi (salmon, tuna, and I believe yellowtail), California roll, and tempura. It filled the two of us up and we had to get the rest to bring home. Their desserts looked good as well. I think this is a good spot for hibachi and Japanese dining. I think if they updated the pillows then the place would have a better new look and feel to it."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Can't stop talking about it!! Will definitely go back next time we're in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Overpriced restaurant and plenty of MSG in their food. Looking for a heart attack or a stroke? This is the place. Service is up & down."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite sushi places.   The fish and rolls are high quality.  The people I have found that don't like it just like the all you can eat places.  There are a good mix of rolls and the staff is very friendly"}
{"text":"I have been craving deep fried ice cream not the corn flakes kind but the like batter kind. I saw a picture of Osaka's tempura fried ice cream and it www just what I was looking for.  It's amazing and you get a very large portion lol I wouldn't mind sharing...I'll definitely be a frequent flyer"}
{"text":"When you look at the outside of Osaka, don't be fooled by how it looks.  The parking is small and narrow and there are no windows outside.  However, once inside, you'll notice the ambience is nice and you will dine Japanese style.  Yes, taking off your shoes or flip-flops and sitting on the floor.  I must say that this is one of the best sushi places I have ever been to.   The sushi is good and the presentation is simple.  The udon is good as well, but I was unable to finish it.  I ordered the Oh My God sushi and I noticed that they added lettuce to their sushi.  I found it strange, but I found not difference in taste.  The sushi wasn't mind blowing and I don't know why they named it Oh My God.    Service was great.  Our (I went with my sister and boyfriend) server was always checking on us if we wanted more water or anything else to eat.  We only had to ask him once for refill.  He was always on top of things.    Overall, I wouldn't mind coming here again.  Maybe I should order the San Diego Salmon."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat at, especially for sushi! Their service is awesome and I love their tempura, miso soup, teriyaki chicken, japanese lasagna roll, etc. They also have great desserts! My favorite is the tiramisu. I know, you're thinking.. at a Japanese restaurant? Well, it's some of the best I've had & I've eaten tiramisu in Little Italy in NYC. Go check it out!"}
{"text":"Osaka Bistro is awesome, if you appreciate quality sushi that is. The sushi/sashimi is fresh and authentic. I got the medium sashimi platter which was enough for four to share. It had a good assortment of fish from snow crab and fresh abalone to hamachi and hirame. I'm drooling just thinking back to that sashimi platter! I also had another platter with the various types of nigiri sushi that I ordered. The amaebi and kinmedai were terrific! The toro melted in my mouth! I also had the shigoku oysters which were fantastic and fresh! There are many other sushi rolls to choose from and a large menu with items from the kitchen if sushi is not your preference. My mom loves their sukiyaki. She and my dad have been coming here for years and now that I've seen why, I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Always enjoy sushi here."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Osaka for awhile. They've been around for awhile. They're a steady sushi spot. They've thrown in some new items as they've aged. The \"bistro\" part was only recently added, at least to my recollection they were once only known as Osaka. The restaurant, although in a seedy part of town, has been kept up well. I'm sure at some point in time, this spot was a GOOD spot in town. But you can't really help what happens to an aging city. You can help keeping your restaurant clean and nice looking, which Osaka has done.  I enjoy the atmosphere of Osaka, it is dimly lit when you first walk in and around the tepanyaki areas. However, the dining area is well lit with nice, clean, wooden tables. The service has always been up to par when I have visited. The servers are well versed on the menu, they are around consistently to refill drinks (I usually always order a hot green tea).   On my last visit I went with a friend because I had a LivingSocial deal, which they honored without any hesitation. I had a few different items: Age Dashi Tofu. I thought it was pretty good, although I have had a better age dashi tofu at Cafe de Japon. The serving they give at Osaka is quite large. I shared some with my friend. The broth it was in was a teeny bit salty for me, but I did drink it all up. Moving on to sushi, because that's what I came for. I ordered the Lisa Lisa roll (shrimp tempura, cream cheese, avocado, eel sauce). It was decent. Not the best or worst roll I've ever had. The tempura was on the soggy side. Wish it had had a more crispness to it. Next: temaki (hand roll). I always get a hand roll when I eat sushi. I ordered the Miki's special, it's simple: crab, massago, and mayo. It was good. And lastly: nigiri. I ordered the sweet shrimp (Ama Ebi). This was my favorite by far. I wish I had just ordered a bunch of these. They were stuffed full, very generous portions.   My friend also allowed me to try some of the food she got. I unfortunately cannot remember what it was she ordered. But one thing was the Japanese pancake, which I really liked because it had seafood in it.   We ended our meal with the Bomba - chocolate peanut butter! I highly recommend this. It was very good.   Overall I like Osaka. I will be back again. They have a very extensive menu and I would like to try more sushi as well as their Udon."}
{"text":"Always love coming here for real, traditional Japanese food. Osaka keeps an authentic menu, prepared to perfection, which is getting harder to find with all of these fusion-type Asian restaurants sprouting up. While that's alright sometimes, when I want an authentic Japanese dish made right, I come here. Love the ambiance & the staff is very friendly also."}
{"text":"Food and service was amazing. I was unclear from the entry on where to sit or if anything else was available for seats other than the few tables. However the establishment clearly needs a remodel but the food made me forget about my environment. I will return!"}
{"text":"I love the little hole in the wall joints and found this place on Yelp.  We walked in and immediately sat at the bar, which we love to do.  We didn't realize that they had an entire back section where it was more or less traditional Japanese seating which is lower to the ground.    Great food.  Loved the Sushi and the service was great."}
{"text":"We keep coming back for the fish. The Sushi is top notch and of superior quality including their neighbors across the street.  The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is the service.  We've eaten there about a dozen times for both lunch and dinner (happy hour rocks too!) but I swear unless you're sitting at the sushi bar or at the grill they'll barely check on you except to take your order and drop your food.  Still, the food is fantastic (although a little overpriced) so we'll be back again"}
{"text":"This is a layback take off your shoes(literally) Tatami tables kind of place, cozy and comfortable place to enjoy delicious Japanese cuisine. Love the variety of prices not so expensive(lots of options) can be if you don't take the time to read the menu.... Overall it's a great place for Sushi, teriyaki platter, or Kobe-beef."}
{"text":"NICE TIME This restaurant has everything that you need. From Japanese to Chinese cuisine there is something that can feast your appetite. This restaurant has a live band that you can enjoy while eating your delicious food. All of the sashimi is very fresh and the special rolls menu had many interesting flavors to their rice and their sauces. The service is quite excellent as well. When you walk in the hostess is very classy and polite. It feels like you a part of their \"family\" in a way. There is nothing bad I could say about this restaurant. It's sleek, clean, warm, and tasty."}
{"text":"I keep thinking I have visited here before and I probably have.  It's one of my mom's favorite places.  But I go to Vegas once a year (missed last year) to visit my family (mother, brothers and inlaws, cousins) for Christmas or other occassions (bdays, graduations).    My mom's favorite is shrimp tempura so she almost always gets this.  Food is good enough, pricing I would say is medium. I normally don't pay (the oldest brother does) but for this occasion since this is my mom's bday, I footed the bill.  It was not bad for 6 people (but none of us drink so that helps make sure the bill is decent).  I had the combo (they have plenty of that).  I finished it off.  My sis-in-law got the salmon kale salad and got a taste of it (I enjoyed it very much).  We were there on a Wed night and there was live music (interestingly loungey).    Pricing good, food tastes good. Not too busy on a weeknight.  Everything went well.  Leftovers were brought home to enjoy (my mom).  They also have a tepanyaki (grill) so if you want anything grilled, even if you are on the non-grill side, it will take some time so we forgo that order for the husband.  He had the beef teriyaki and by the sign of the leftovers, was not enthusiastic about it.  No reservations needed on a weeknight."}
{"text":"Delicious japanese food. Order the two boats the Titanic and the Ron. U can't go wRONg. Thank me later"}
{"text":"The smell in the Osaka Japanese grill room is disgusting. The chef was very happy and had great jokes but burnt the rice, which is my favorite.  Then everything after that was not good.  This was the first time in my life Didn't t  take home my leftovers and love love love them."}
{"text":"I do not like this place, it feels like I was pushed through like cattle. The food is not that great and they never come to your table even to offer you more napkins or forks. I would not go there again"}
{"text":"I stopped writing reviews on Yelp because it was too time consuming, but after eating at this restaurant, I can't help but tell the world about our experience, one that I hope will make other people wary of coming here.  We arrived at Osaka on a typical Saturday afternoon (1pm-ish) and was shown a table in the back room (where the tables were larger).  As we walked past the first room upon entering, I noticed that it was fairly empty but it didn't struck me as odd since there are so many restaurants to choose from in Las Vegas.  We sat down and were given multiple menus, each one with something different in it.  I guess this could be a good thing since I like having lots of choices.  We ordered our drinks (hot green tea and iced green tea) and browsed the menus for omakase, which we heard from someone (ahem) that it is worth coming here for.  After everyone in our party arrived (there were 5 of us), we asked the waitress about their omakase and she completely hesitated. I thought that was strange considering this should be a simple question.  She said she'll be right back, so we sat there, thinking maybe she's just new or something.  But even so... o_O.  She came back and in broken English asked us if we wanted sashimi or sushi, and we said a little of both.  She then proceeded to say that it's $100 for all four people that wanted it, and I confirmed if it was $100 per person, or if it was $100 for all four people because that makes a HUGE difference.  She said $100 for four people, so we agreed.  After ordering the \"omakase\" - I realized that she must have ordered us the plate of normal sashimi/sushi that was on the menu.  I remember seeing $50 for 2 people for something, so with 4 people, she just doubled it.  I thought sure... why not.  We were going to try their assortment of rolls, but given that the omakase is supposed to be good, I decided to give it a try.  The first plate of sashimi came out looking decent.  I'm not too familiar with the names and the translation for the type of fish, so I'm just going to say that I tried just about everything on the menu and only a couple items tasted okay.  There were quite a few nasty bites in between, including one in which I had to spit out.  Now, I'm not a sushi snob at all, but when I have to do that, it means it's NOT good.  My companions agreed, and another person had to go thru that ritual later on in the meal as well (said one of the fish tasted grainy too).  Fortunately, our napkins were right in front of us.  =)  As an additional note, we received 2 additional plates of sushi rolls which were supposed to be part of the omakase deal.  We thought it was just so-so as well... perhaps even bad.  At the end of the meal, we noticed the $100 + $70 on top of our other charges.  We asked about the $70 and they said it was for the 2 plates of sushi rolls that accompanied our sashimi omakase plate. Needless to say, that $70 was a surprise because we were told  it was $100 for four people.  If they told us they were going to bring additional sushi plates for $35 each, I think we would've either said no, or ordered or own rolls.  Ugh.  I hate when mess-ups like this happen.  We told our waitress about the issue and she left to talk to the owner/mgr.  The owner/mgr. came by quite awhile later to ask us what the issue was.  We explained clearly about the unexpected charge and the miscommunication but he wouldn't budge.  In fact, he brought up how good of a quality the fish were, and given that, this is still a good deal.  The whole time, I kept thinking if I should tell the truth about the quality of his fish, but I kept my mouth shut in case he was going to give us a break.  I suppose we all could've said something because at the end, nothing happened out of the negotiation.  He wouldn't even take the charge of one $35 plate of sushi off, so we paid, left, and vowed never to come back.    I've had a lot of sushi before, but I would rank this as the worst sushi AND experience ever.  There are a ton of other great sushi restaurants in Vegas, so look it up on Yelp and go there.  You will not regret it."}
{"text":"Sit at the bar and ask for Shu. He makes the best sushi I ever had. The rice doesn't fall out when you try and eat it.   Ask for the fresh wasabi too, so much better then the paste.   Great quality fish and a huge selection."}
{"text":"Soooooooo disgusting didnt like food and it SMELLED like BATHROOM dont recomend this place"}
{"text":"Saw Osaka Japanese Bistro highlighted on a recent Triple D episode and had to try it. We were in Vegas for the weekend and sick of casino food so this was the perfect alternative.   Restaurant atmosphere:  My mom - born and raised in Osaka, Japan - was skeptical as soon as we pulled into the parking lot. She was even more skeptical as we entered the establishment. We were greeted with a black wall! It's drab, a bit dark and the decor is sadly lacking in so many ways...outdated, dingy and not so appealing.   We opted to sit in the tatami room vs. at the tables near the sushi bar. The set-up...taking off of the shoes, tatami mats (I suspect those tatami mats haven't been cleaned in a long time!) GROSS.   If you know anything about the Japanese culture you know that cleanliness is at the top of the list. The second generation owners of this establishment need to take note of this and make an effort to create an atmosphere which is bright, clean and inviting.   Food: Mom ordered the sashimi and tempura combo $22. She said the sashimi was delicious but she was not happy with the rest of her meal. The sunomono cucumbers were crunchy and they're not supposed to be served that way. The rice - plain ol rice - was not cooked thoroughly. RICE - served any way is KEY in any respectable Japanese restaurant!! The miso soup was ok. I ordered the Nebeyaki Udon. The base was good but overall I wasn't impressed.   The rolls are way too overpriced and I just wasn't going to pay $15-$20 for a 'specialty' roll!   Service: our waitress was super nice. I think her name was Haruko. She spoke fluent Japanese which was a plus for my mom. She made suggestions, was attentive and checked in on us several times. There were additional servers that came to check on our dining experience as well and they were very nice as well.   The restroom: F'in disgusting!!! What the heck! You couldn't even wash your hands as there was only a trickle of water! Is this the ONLY restroom in the establishment???!!! Is this where the servers, cooks and SUSHI CHEF washes their hands after they relieve themselves??!!  The hands they will use to prepare and serve your food???!!!! This is a health code violation!   I don't think the average diner is aware of an authentic Japanese dining experience. It definitely isn't at Osaka Japanese Bistro. We were disappointed to say the least.   1 star rating = half for service and half for sashimi!"}
{"text":"I love Osaka. Their food really good, place is clean and good customer services. Nice place to go with your family"}
{"text":"My cousin loves this place. We were actually seated at Steak N Shake and we had this epiphany that we should go get sushi instead. So we got up and drove all the way up the I-15 to Osaka.  When you enter, you're greeted by a blank wall. What is this - a Japanese Speakeasy? You then turn right and go through another door that takes you to a small sushi bar area. From this initial view, you'd think the place was tiny. If you continue to the back and left, though, you discover that the place can seat quite a lot of people. They have a Teppanyaki area and a surprising number of private booths and traditional looking Japanese sunken dining tables. The space is very aesthetically pleasing.  Unfortunately, when it came to the food, I was disappointed. I really wasn't that hungry, but I tried everything that my cousin ordered. We stuck to their late night special menu that is available 10pm-2am.  * Beef Tataki Salad - It looked amazing, but it lacked flavor. I think I've only ever had Beef Tataki at Ichiza and theirs runs circles around Osaka's. * King Crab Tempura - This was easily the best thing we ordered. Delicious. * Salmon Skin (half) Roll - This also lacked flavor. I'm kind of a purist in that I like to eat sushi exactly how the chef made it. I never use soy sauce or add wasabi. I stuck to my guns on this, despite the roll really needing the extra flavor. * Screaming Orgasm (ahi sashimi on top of some salad) - This also looked amazing. It had better flavor than the Beef Tataki, but I wasn't blown away by it. The dressing was a little too vinegary.  On the plus side, the service was excellent. The two ladies that served us were extremely friendly and attentive to our needs. The green tea tasted great and was the perfect thing on my still recovering throat. Whenever I was running low on tea, the lady would come back and top it off promptly.  I really hate giving less than three stars, but I must stay true to the rating system. Indeed, I have experienced better. It's too bad because the service and decor of Osaka are top notch."}
{"text":"Food was good, but after the meal were told only cards with chips are taken. My bank doesn't have a chip and I was told to go to a cash machine. The managers solution was not acceptable and a self printed sign adjacent to the entry door is not acceptable! David the manager was unprofessional and unable to handle the situation. His response was childish and has made a loyal customer of over six years decide to never return! A negative star is appropriate for the actions of the manager alone!"}
{"text":"Who would have thought that the desert could serve some good fish?  Well after much searching through the phone book and online listings, I found a great Japanese restaurant while vacationing in Las Vegas.  Every time I'm the area, I always end up having dinner here at least once.  I'm big on the raw fish, and Osaka takes the cake for having really good sushi while not hammering too hard on the price. And it's not one of those Asian fusion restaurants on the Strip, so that adds to its appeal.    If you're in the mood for Japanese, try this place.  Plus they have combo dinners and soups that would appeal to the non-raw fish eaters too."}
{"text":"I love this place!  O-Toro all day!  They always have some sort of fish that's not on the typical menu.  The mussels are out of this world.  Go and enjoy good sushi here."}
{"text":"First of all Kenji and Himae are fast and friendly so sit at the bar.  The quality of the fish is amazing. I say don't fill up on rice eat sashimi or nigiri pairs.  The garlic tuna( maguru) is delicious. Also try the Shikoku oysters amazing.  I can't say there was anything I didn't like my friend ate 20 pieces of himachi, so it must have been good. Kenji also made me a lemon salmon roll with avocado and cucumber inside which wasn't on the menu. Great people and high quality food!"}
{"text":"Absolutely my favorite sushi place in Vegas! The food is delicious and at a reasonable price but more importantly very clean. Meaning: I have never gotten sick from eating here. This is a common scare with eating any food raw. I trust this place, especially for my \"sushi virgin\" friends. Favorite rolls: Oh My God, Japanese Lasagna, and a simple salmon nigiri (oh so fresh and sweet!).  If you come with a group of people, they have \"sushi boats,\" which are literally wooden boats full of sushi (prefixed selection though). There is no all you can eat menu but I'm not really into that. Just go to any Osaka location, you will not be disappointed!"}

{"text":"Been coming here for the past 10 years and we can't have enough of this place, tried a lot of places in Vegas but this place Rocks!!! The Sushi Chef Jaime knows what we like and we don't , as soon as you walk in the door they will greet you and call you by your name of course if you come here often like we do lol! Everything is fresh ready to serve as order! Tried pretty much everything off the menu and what can I say? It's really good! Highly recommend this place for Family, friends or even date night!"}
{"text":"Osaka's Bistro was okay. I have definitely experienced better. I thought being an older establishment it would be better. Businesses do not stay around 30+ years if they are bad.   I would say the food was average for Teppanyaki. There was nothing fantastic about it. The facility is incredibly small, OLD, and definietly seen better days. I thought the private rooms were probably the best part, however, I did not dine in one.   There was only one bathroom, and it was not exactly clean. The bar was small, drinks were overpriced and the sushi was so-so. Overall it was an average experience, with average food, average service and an expensive price tag. we paid $160.00 for four people. I will not be going again."}
{"text":"Have probably eaten here 30 times. It's definitely the best sushi in the area and its very affordable.  It's way better than all the all you can eat places nearby and will cost maybe $10 more.  The raw fish here is always fresh and high quality.  I would reccomend the sushi, tiger roll, kalbi rib appetizer and the black forrest cake.  Also the lunch special is a great deal would recommend checking it out."}
{"text":"My favorite place to go when eating sushi with the family. I usually try to go during lunchtime because dinner can get pretty busy. The servers are nice and attentive. It's my go-to place for a nice lunch, and sometimes dinner, with the family,   P.S. It's not just the sushi that's good. Curries, udon, etc. Delicious. :)"}
{"text":"My partner an die always go there to eat sushi and fry rice, but last night we had David has a server and was terrible! I didn't see him before there but he did a really bad job. no water, we order the first plate of sushi and wait more than 20 minutes to get the second order and never show. went to the cashier to paid my bill and he was ether chilllin, and when I told him very generous about the waiting he didn't said nothing and either good night or so, very very unprofessional ...."}
{"text":"I love sushi..but I was a bit disappointed  with this company. .. service seems to be slow. .. and when I ordered  yellowtail nigiri I asked for ponzu sauce on it with jalapeño and siracha on top they said they weren't able to do it because they were to busy in the back room....so I told them to give me a side of all three so I can do it myself...it's not an all you can place ...so not sure why they were not able to do it....im spending the money for each piece of sushi.."}
{"text":"We found this restaurant on Drive-in diners and Dives. This is the sister restaurant to the in on the Strip. We ordered John's boat. The sashimi (tuna, yellow tail and salmon) was so fresh!  The beef teriyaki was very tender. I think it was beef rib eye.  Was afraid there would be too much food for 2b but it was just right. Will come back again"}
{"text":"Go here all the time. Especially for the late night menu. It is a cozy atmosphere and always something new to try. Depends on the server,  but sometimes it's great or slow. But besides that it's fun and always changing while keeping the classics."}
{"text":"Amazing as usual. The food is great and the service is exceptional. It's not just good for sushi, the udon here is the best we've had in Vegas."}
{"text":"I am a HUGE fan of Sushi. I have been to this location 3 or 4 times now and I am hooked! I live in Chinatown, this place is so good that I actually leave Chinatown to eat here.  What is so good? -The Seating! This place is huge. They have sushi bar seating, table seating in the back and Hibachi.  - The Service! The service is ALWAYS spot on. I have sat in all parts of this location and it is always perfect. The staff speaks clearly so I don't feel like I need to do sign language unlike some sushi places in Vegas... -The Dessert! I never thought I would find an asian restaurant with amazing dessert, but this place takes the cake... Or should I say chocolate ice cream amazining-ness ;) I actually LOVE the gelato!  They have a full bar which is always nice as well :)"}
{"text":"I ordered the usual and customary hamachi sashimi, the dish that sets the bar for me and my sushi adventures.  Well, not the best Hamachi I've had.  It was fresh, but kinda tough, it didn't give me that melt in my mouth kinda feeling I like.  Good portions though.  Kinda expensive.   Fast service.  All in all, just another mediocre experience.  Get your sashimi sushi when you're closer to the ocean."}
{"text":"I'm big on first impressions, so when friends said this place was good, we decided to check it out.  Our waitress was very nice. The sushi was descent and the beer selection was great.  Here's the bad: terribly slow service. It took over 30mins to make a simple roll. Luckily we dined with friends so we weren't in a hurry but we hardly saw our waitress. I shouldn't have to flag people down just to find out the status of an order. When she did finally return, she gave us our check. She never came back. Had to go to the counter to pay which is no big deal but I waited for 20mins just to pay. Staff just walked by me and several people waiting to pay, not even acknowledging anyone.  I won't return. There is a huge selection of sushi places I would rather go to."}
{"text":"The waiters and the guy greeting is on the front here super nice but overall the food didn't amaze me.  I much prefer the original Osaka on the other side of town. Something about this place just isn't as good.  Ordered salmon and yellowtail nigiri and the rice wasn't good and tasted old.  Miso soup and udon tasted very artificial and bland. Did not enjoy the taste.  The oh kamisama rolls and the catapillar rolls were tasty but super sauced. If you aren't into the simple, fish/rice combos and you like the very Americanized, super saucy rolls then you will enjoy ordering the rolls.   Overall, service was very nice but for the price I'd rather make the farther drive to the original Osaka on the other side."}
{"text":"Ordered a late night pick-up dinner of 5 assorted rolls and some kimchi. The sushi was very good, and the prices very reasonable."}
{"text":"A staple of mine while I was going to school down the street, I am almost obligated to write a review for this fine establishment. A sushi joint that has yet to let me down.   Osaka serves all of their items a la carte, so no AYCE. But if you have the extra money and want better quality sushi than what you would get from a AYCE place, come here.  Anytime of day is a good time to come, they have lunch and late night specials. The rolls and nigiri are always fresh and delicious, and I regularly order their various bento boxes, combo meals, and appetizers. I am more of a nigiri guy, but this place has plenty of appetizing and unique rolls that I will often order. As I stated earlier, this place has yet to let me down, I have ordered a lot of different items off the menu, and they are always on point.  The service is always top notch. The wait staff is always attentive, and will always customize your order to your liking. I've never gotten a wrong order, food that took forever to come out, or items missing. If you decide to eat at the bar, the sushi chefs are awesome, and will always start up conversation to be friendly and to see what you would want to order and make suggestions. One of my go to chefs is Oscar. He is normally there during the lunch hours, and always makes awesome rolls. He even does his own custom order of baked mussels with Sriracha sauce that is awesome, ask for it, and he will be happy to make it for you.  While not necessarily a con, it can be pricey to get your fill here  if you just plan on eating sushi. But it comes with better quality of food, so it almost cancels itself out. They at least have a reward card here to accumulate some free food after a couple of visits.  It is one of the older sushi spots in Vegas for a reason. Top quality food with awesome service is always a good combo when eating out somewhere."}
{"text":"Been waay too long since I've come here. And how I've missed it.  The fish is always super fresh , osaka rice and baked mussels are always a pleasure.  We have the ultimate osaka roll, lisa lisa, unagi roll, yum yum roll, and rainbow roll. A wide variety of goodness.  Don't be afraid to step out of your comfort zone and try something new , they will not disappoint.  As always service was a pleasure,  our waiter was very fast and friendly as well!"}
{"text":"I must say, I've been to many sushi Japanese bistro places in Las Vegas, however this would have to be my most favorite. I was introduce to this place by my lovely sister in which she has shown me the capabilities these chefs have in making their dishes as for as presentation.   First off l, their edamame is the best I've tasted. It is not just served plainly or with salt sprinkled, but it is first pan fried with garlic and then garnished with chili sesame oil. I'm not kidding I could not stop eating them! My second dish was the dynamite roll made with delicious scallop, clam and crab and a nice spicy specially sauce to go with it! The texture was there and so was the taste!   Overall I had a great experience. I would definitely recommend and head back next time I visit. The service is on point there and even with drunk Vegas crowds they still manage to keep there cool!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent. We got food from the grill and it was the best I've had in a long time. The restaurant is small and fills up so I would try to call and make a reservation if you want to get a seat during prime time."}
{"text":"Very American style sushi, not what I was expecting. I like the taste of raw fish and don't appreciate nigiri coming from the chef with so much wasabi the fish can't be tasted, especially if that is the experience on the majority of the pieces. Rolls aren't much better, the Aces and Yum Yum were  bland, and in the case of the Aces over powered by sauces. Total price was $90 for two (Friday 6/20/14). If you like Wasabi more than fish, and prefer McDonald's to In&out this place might be for you,  but if you'd like even a hint of tradition or subtle flavors look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Love this place. Went there for our anniversary dinner and so glad we did. We felt very special as it was just us at the grill. Our chef was so engaging and entertaining! He made sure we got everything he cooked to our complete satisfaction. The hosts were so attentive too making sure our drinks were always fresh. And the food! The soup, salad, rice, beef, shrimp and chicken are made to your liking. You don't feel rushed at all. If I could give it more than 5 stars I would."}
{"text":"Years ago I would have given this place 5 stars, sadly it has declined. The timing of the food was horrible, as one entree did not come until about 15 minutes after the first one - and there was only two of us. The late entree arrived in stages which was kind of annoying and when the chicken arrived it was absolutely cold. The sushi was ok - that alone would be 3 stars."}
{"text":"I lived in Las Vegas for a couple of years and this is one of the places I miss the most.  They always have good food and have never disappointed me.  On this visit my hubby had some assorted sushi - which he just loved - and I had a combination dinner.  The tempura was cooked perfectly and the chicken was moist and delicious."}
{"text":"this is my favorite place for sushi that doesn't have an all you can eat deal. it looks small from the outside but once you're in you  have a variety of seats from the sushi bar or tables or private booths. my favorite roll is matsui #55. the sashimi is consistently fresh. service is very friendly. if you can't decide what you want by reading it off the menu they have plasma tvs at every booth that show pictures of each roll with their names.   this location has pretty much the same menu as the eastern location. the lake mead location is separately owned and operated with a completely different menu.   they also have a VIP card available that you use each time you eat and it accumulates a 'bonus' which gives you a discount off your next visit after you accumulate $10."}
{"text":"I love Osaka but a few things I didn't like like the fried rice and had king crab sushi once that had ice particles."}
{"text":"Decided to come over here off the strip with some friends.  And since I rarely go off-strip whenever I'm in Vegas, I figured I'd give it a shot and grabbed a taxi.  That said, I was generally impressed by the ratio of price to sushi during lunch time compared to sushi on the strip.  The quality was pretty good overall.  Though, I honestly forgot what I ordered though since I had more sake than sushi (something along the lines of a badass samurai or something), but I had no issues with the sushi."}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying that Osaka has some damn good sushi and reasonable prices. The booths in the back are cool and they have a very large menu selection.  Now let me get to the part where I will never forgive them for doing what they did:  I had made a reservation for 16 people 2 weeks in advance of my birthday for dinner. I checked back with them several times during those 2 weeks, including 24 hours before and they kept telling me it was all good and they would have my table ready at the exact time.  Well, I showed up on my birthday and was told they didn't have my reservation. ANYWHERE. And that I will have to wait until a table is finally available.  My friends and I waited for over an hour, when they finally came to check on us because we were starting to fill up the seats in their cramped bar area, they offered us a couple free drinks after which they told me we will still have to wait another hour for a table.  Are you kidding me? On my birthday? Screw you, Osaka. Your organizational skills are horrible and your sushi doesn't make up for your lousy service. Even on my previous trips to this restaurant, the service is always either really slow or they mess something up on your bill or they forget to get you an item you ordered, yet I have never complained because I thought I broke even with how good the sushi was.  Well, never again. And I would actually like to thank the horrible staff at Osaka for my introduction to Ichiza, who have WAY better sushi and are so friendly and prompt with their service.   The gist: Osaka has horrible service, go to Ichiza instead. It's right by there near Chinatown and has much better food, prices and service even though it's about half the size of Osaka."}
{"text":"It's been a long time since I last visited Osaka. Boy, what a difference. It used to be a traditional Japanese restaurant, but now, it's turned into a fusiony bistro. I should've read the reviews on here before going.  The restaurant is now separated into tatami rooms, teppanyaki, sushi bar etc -- we got the tatami room.... which was fine. We got a sushi platter, zaru soba, selections from their robatayaki menu and agedashi tofu. The zaru soba was actually really good. Robatayaki items weren't bad either -- skimpy portions though. The sushi however, blows! I was so damn disappointed in the poor quality we were given. They used to be fantastic.  After this visit, I really won't be returning again. I like my sushi traditional. I'm kinda a stickler about that. The agedashi tofu was quite dismal too, not true authentic agedashi tofu at all. It was so dismal that the young man refused to eat it and he was the one who ordered it.  The service was attentive though hence the extra star. They have a late night menu with discounted prices after 10pm."}
{"text":"I like Osaka mostly because they have good sake samplers and decent food for those who don't eat fish.  I have been here with friends on numerous occasions and have always managed to find something to eat without fish.  Having lived in Japan for years, I like to think my broken nihongo has a hand in me getting what I would like...  Love the Inari and the tofu soup was bland but not too bad.  The tea here is one of the reasons I like to come here..sooo tasty.    The Sake is great I had rice, cold, warm and flavored and enjoyed almost all of it.  Great to go with a group of friends, sit in the back on the tatami and drink, eat and be merry.  The waiter was kind of nice to give us the some remainders of open bottles since were shutting the place down.  A big bonus because it was normally not something I would order because of the expense.    The place is good for groups, and the seating is somewhat private so you can have a good time.  Like all tatami you can take your shoes off and sit cross legged which I love."}
{"text":"Great ambience. I love the customer service here i been coming here for a little over a year now. I am NOT very open to many sushi restaurants because i have gotten sick. I have NEVER gotten sick here at osaka and my food from the kitchen is always fresh and Hot.   I onyl eat a few things in a sushi Restaurant and its usually not on the menu and have to be customized to my liking... they always make my custom sushi roll to my liking with a smile every time s/o to Heimi hes a Kool Guy. I also eat shrimp Ebbi whichi is great here as well. See pics below for what I eat every time. Thanks Osaka"}
{"text":"What can I say? The BEST JAPANESE RESTAURANT IN VEGAS! ^_^  I love their rolls, their sashimi are so fresh and delicious!  My fav dinner dish is Teriyaki beef, they are smoky!  They have Teppan table but I always prefer the sitting at the tatami room, cause it's so cozy and private if you want to bring your partner.  Service is wonderful, and food came out fast.  For desert, I recommend the green tea mousse, they have the most prefect taste, not too sweet and not too creamy."}
{"text":"Looking for a late night sushi place that offers happy hour specials, we were referred to Osaka's in Henderson.  Walking into this pretty big and established restaurant, we're given three menus to peruse!  There's seating available at the sushi bar, the tables, and even tatami rooms!  The menus are quite extensive and you have to spend a great deal of time doing the matching game.  One menu offers the happy hour specials, but in order to find out what's in each roll, you have to read through their regular menu.  It takes a good while!  A large selection of rolls and thank goodness for pictures.  They all start to sound the same though and many of them overlap.  They also offer this Buy 10 Get One Free from their special roll menu.    You can also do Shabu Shabu, Sukiyaki, or Yosenabe here if you'd like!    We finally decided on a few things from their happy hour menu, and surprisingly, we didn't end up with much sushi!    777 Roll ($9.95 HH price, $12.95 reg.) - \"Shrimp, scallop, miki, tobiko, cream cheese; topped with avocado, albacore and served with garlic and yumyum sauce.\"  It's a pretty good roll, but fatty as hell because that yumyum sauce is a mayonnaise-based sauce.  You can tell how bad it is for you once you take the first bite!    Deep Fried Tofu ($3.50 HH price, $4.95 reg.) - Also known as Agedashi tofu.  It was a bit tough, not easy to break apart.  I prefer my agedashi a little softer so my spoon can gently cut into it.  Tonkatsu ($3.50 HH price) - I'm not a particular big fan of the pork cutlet, but the BF is.  He thought it was pretty good and such a great value that he ordered another!  Shishamo ($2.80 HH price, $3.80 reg.) - Grilled smelt fish with smelt eggs - it was okay here.  I've had better.  A bit tough and on the smaller end.  Osaka Rice ($4.95 HH price, $6.95 reg.) - \"Mixture of sushi rice, crab, masago, yum yum sauce, sesame oil and siracha sauce.\"  My friend was eating this as she's ordered it before.  It was okay, there wasn't enough taste going on for my preference.    Seafood Salad ($6.95 HH price, $14.95 reg.) - Lots more sunomono in it than I would have preferred.  I usually like my seafood salad to have a more seafood than anything else.  If you sit facing the sushi bar, they have a slide show on the computer screens with their different rolls and dishes presented.      Overall, the food here is a bit more expensive than other Japanese restaurants. They are obviously doing okay since this is their second location   Late night happy hour is good until 1:45 am!  You can find a 10% coupon on their website too!  (Food pics can be found in the business profile!)"}
{"text":"It's late on a Sunday night and the BF suggests trying out the original Osaka after having visited their second location a few weeks back.   Walking through the front door, you immediately face a wall.  Not the most feng shui I'm sure, but make a right down the hall and you'll see another entrance which brings you right to the sushi bar.  I noted to the BF that this location was way smaller, and he then pointed out they had more room in the back.  We took a walk down there after eating to check out their tatami room (lots of space), semi-private booths, and a hibachi grill area too.  They are pretty fancy here with slide shows running on a computer screen at every booth in the back.  I would be even more impressed if it was a touch screen where you can order all your food by pressing your selection.  That would be super high tech!    Anyway, back to the review and the food.  The menus are pretty much the same at both locations, for the most part.  From their late night happy hour menu, this is what we ordered:  * Shishamo ($2.80) - It came with three pieces.  Again a bit tougher than what I'm used to.  They seasoned it with black pepper, but I asked for some salt to give it a little more kick too.  * Korean-Style Spicy Chicken ($4.50) - It's literally stir-fried chicken with Korean spicy sauce on a bed of lettuce.  I wasn't sure if the lettuce was garnish or to eat.  Oh well, I ate it.  * Crazy Horse Roll ($4.20) - It's tuna, salmon, masago and mixed together with spicy sauce.  It's a very basic roll, but pretty good.  * Fire Roll ($3.90) - Crab meat and spicy sauce.  Unfortunately, it looks like the CA rolls you buy from the supermarket, but without the avocado in it.  It had a bit of kick in it.  And from their regular menu:   * Ankimo ($6.95) - Monkfish liver...oh how I love this stuff.  It's an acquired taste.  I like to soak my chunk in ponzu sauce and then break off a tiny piece and savor each little morsel.  The BF likes to dunk his piece into the sauce and then toss the whole thing in his mouth.  He likes to then mush it around in his mouth.  Haha!  They are known for their exotic and colorful rolls, and they can be a bit a pricey.  It's our unfortunate luck that the only two rolls we ordered were so visually boring.    Service: It wasn't too busy this late in the evening.  A handful of people at the bar and few people at the tables.  The BF had to ask for his soda to be refilled and the waitress never came back with his drink!  When he asked for it, the waitress got him another one.  Then a few minutes later, she came by and took his drink away!  (We were wondering why she did that.)  When she came back with his drink, she said she was refilling it again.  (I guess to make up for his drink disappearing in the first place.)  The BF asked for my own pot of tea since I'm a big tea drinker and to save them the trouble of having to refill my teacup every five seconds.  One waiter came by twice to take away dishes that we weren't done yet.  In the process, he would try to squeeze in between us to reach for the plate, only to realize there was still food on it.  And finally at the end of our meal when the plate was clearly empty, then he asked if he could take it!  We were amused.  And actually, when we are both done sharing a plate, we actually put it to the side to help them out for that reason - so they don't have to reach in between a couple of lovebirds.  Duh!       Don't forget that you can get a 10% coupon when you visit their website!  (Yep, there's pics of our food eats in the business profile!)"}
{"text":"This is the best sushi restaurant in the Las Vegas area, and I make it a point to eat here at least twice whenever I am in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Oscar is a great chef ! One of the best sushi places in Las Vegas ! Fast service and the sushi is amazing"}
{"text":"This is a nice Japanese restaurant that looks like it caters to Henderson locals.  I'd probably give it 3.5 stars, but rounding up doesn't seem too inaccurate.  The ambience is good, but not great.  It's not really great for a romantic night - it's more like a good place for an after work get together.  They have the fake tatami tables, where it looks like you're sitting on the floor with a low table, but the ground is actually hollowed out and you're sitting normally with no shoes.  The food was good, but the portions seemed a bit on the small side.  The fish was fresh and service was excellent.  One thing that I really liked is that you can get any roll or sushi dish with brown rice.  It's not the greatest thing you'll ever eat, but I sometimes go on strange diets and it's nice to have this as an option."}
{"text":"Had lunch with a friend today and asked to sit at the grill!  Today's review is inspired by my fellow Yelper Nelson Q:  L)ow lighting in the back area for an intimate setting one on one O)nly $10.95 for the Teppan chicken lunch special!  Steal :-) V)entilation above all grills = no burning eyes or smokey clothes E)veryone sits around the grill.  Makes for random conversation and new friends!!  T)he fried rice was good, just a little burnt pieces of rice and egg E)ach course uses a lot of oil, butter and sauces, be advised! P)resentation of the meal was excellent!  So entertaining P)roper service from the staff.  Everyone was so accommodating A)nnoying little girl at my table; little rude to the chef; super disappointing N)o need for the sauces given to you in the beginning.  The food is super flavorful Y)akitori style chicken was excellent!  Garlic flavored, sweet and savory at the same time A)ssortment of vegetables to go along with your meal; sauced up nicely! K)ind of my first time doing this...ok it IS my first Teppanyaki experience. I)n the end, sooooo worth the money!  Well I tried do the acronyms justice.  One things for sure, definitely need to try this experience.  Super cool!"}
{"text":"A hidden jewel in LV! We waited for a table to clear for About 30 minutes. And everything was WORTH it! I'm picky with Japanese food because I'm from Gardena, CA, where the old school Japanese live and where the best Japanese food is served in Los Angeles.  Osaka Bistro is one of the best I've been. Oh, I don't know the owner but he was so Nice! Guys try this place next time you go to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Tatami mat area cool. All sashimi fresh. Good service.  Iconic restaurant if you read history.  Benihana type cooking area may have been better choice for comfort."}
{"text":"I brought my boyfriend and our good friends for dinner on Tuesday. We had a great time. Our friends were delighted by the ambiance of the dining area. The sushi was wonderful. We had three bottles of the Zipang Sake and it was priced just right. Cheesecake with strawberries along with two different flavors of Mochi. The mango was really good, but not a big fan of the green tea Mochi. Always be back to this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Disappointing service tonight. We purchased a Groupon to go to dinner there this evening. When we presented the Groupon, the server stated they do take any Groupons. Which was confusing since we purchased the Groupon for that specific location. The manager came over and stated it was a mistake and they would not honor it. The manager seemed like it was our fault and were insulted that we presented the Groupon. He then told us if he accepts it, it will come out of his paycheck, then he left. Food was enjoyable but the poor management."}
{"text":"This place is not very clean :-( need I say more??? Take the extra time to pay more attention to detail. Just filthy"}
{"text":"When first pulling up to the parking lot, don't be scared off like we almost were.  The area is filled with adult themed stores (stripper shoes and attire, adult toys...).  The doors are solid, no windows or anything.  The area looked kind of sketchy.  We decided to go in anyway since the general reviews were good.  I had the chirashi and my wife had the tempura udon (ramen?).  Both were excellent for the price.  Total without drinks or sides was just over $20!  We will definitely come back next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Always a sure bet. Had octopus there for the first time this past winter and was impressed."}
{"text":"Lol just walked in there. Kind of laughable how 3 servers and a bartender were have a wonderful conversation at the bar NOT acknowledging customers who walk in. Disappointing. I mean you can stare at us, but like are we going to be seated by you or serve ourselves? Walked out. Never got a chance to eat at the restaurant. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Exterior was super random and it's in a strip mall but I was pretty surprised to find a cool little spot that's been there since 1967! Attentive service and a huge menu. The large seating area for groups is super super cool."}
{"text":"All I can say about the sushi here is it's amazing. I told my wife to take me somewhere we have never been for sushi together and she chose Osaka because she remembered loving it 6 years ago. Now here for some information on Osaka.  Exterior: I would consider this a hidden gem that is in plain view. I have passed it easily 20-30 times without ever noticing it. It looks like your average chinese restaurant with small signs and red neon lighting all around the place. Don't let this deceive you.  Interior: As soon as you enter the building you feel like your'e in a different world. I'm not saying it's high class but compared to the exterior it looks good. They have three different areas to sit depending on the experience you would like which I enjoyed. You can have your usual sushi experience next to the sushi bar with a couple small tables for couples, a sushi chef prepare your food directly infront of you while he is doing all kind of tricks and making balls of fire, who doesn't like fire? And lastly they take a more traditional approach which I did and liked, you go to a seperate room with enclosed booth style seating where you remove your shoes and sit on small cushions. Cool experience.  Staff: The staff were great. Everyone acted professionally, gave advice on what rolls were ordered most and preferred by other guests, and the service was on point.  Now for the most important part, sushi: The sushi was absolutely amazing!!! We ordered the \"Titanic boat\" which came with a large variety of sushi on a huge boat. It came with 12 pieces of Nigiri (6 salmon, 3 albacore, and 3 tuna) and they melted in your mouth. The fish was so delicate and well prepared I will definitely be back for more. It also came with 5 other half rolls. I apologize as I can't remember the names of them but can assure you each and every bite was delicious. I have been to numerous sushi restaurants in town, many in California, and have a friend who owns one in south Vegas, and this destroys them all. Sorry for being a traitor if you read this buddy.  I will upload pictures later for all of you to drool at your computers. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Most importantly, most amazingly fresh sushi I've ever experienced!!  I think about it at least once a week and it's been three weeks since we dined here for our first time!!  Unfortunately I can't remember the exact name, but it was the closest item they had to spicy tuna on crispy rice.  I think it was called O.M.G.  Or maybe that's just how I felt about it!?!  Secondly, we had the Zack attack.  No it's not a sushi roll, that was the name of our awesome hibachi chef.  He was super sweet, super outgoing and very fun.  He prepared my sea bass wonderfully and the fried rice was the best fried rice I've ever had.  It was fun to introduce my husband to the sea bass as well.  How has he not enjoyed sea bass before?!    All in all a wonderful experience!  I'll just keep daydreaming about it until we can make it back!"}
{"text":"Saw this on Triple D's, first sushi place in Vegas, so yeah gotta try this place out. The lighting is dim and it is casual. We sat in a kinda private booth area, no shoes, so you sit crisscross or yes for those that cannot sit that way you can sit as you normally would in a chair there's room for your legs under the table still.   We came in right when they open since we were heading driving back home after.  Sushi was very fresh and good. We came in time for the lunch special and order every roll on the lunch special which can included a few signature ones. Hey why not, we definitely wanted to try it all. For sure it was worth it and we did finish it!   If your craving sushi come give this place a try and get the experience of the semi- traditional seating area."}
{"text":"Having spent time in Japan this is about as authentic as it gets..! The best rolls and selection in town..!  I have been going there for 9 years and never had a bad meal.! If they would just show the Sumo tournaments at late night I would be there then too..! I always wonder if the bad reviews are by people that have never really had authentic Japanese food..!!"}
{"text":"I was craving sushi, my fiance was craving teppanayki so Osaka seemed like the perfect place to have both.   I liked how they seemed to purposely make sure each teppanyaki party got it's own table and chef. This could have been because they were mostly empty, but I did appreciate having our own table.   Sushi was just OK. It was tightly rolled and they had a nice selection, but the negi hama I had was just OK. Not rotten, not super fresh.. just eh. I did love, however, that they offered half rolls. It was great to be able to get some variety. For ~$15 I was able to try 3 1/2 rolls.. this worked out really well. The rolls with all cooked stuff (shrimp tempura, etc) were great.. but that's hard to screw up.   Teppanyaki was pretty good. Filet mignon was off the hook - seriously the best steak I've had at a  teppanyaki place..very tender and cooked really well. The chicken, sadly, was random end pieces and not too great. Lots of chewy grisley pieces.. eww. The fried rice and veggies were just average.   Overally not a *bad* place , but nothing special. As teppanyaki and sushi are pretty expensive, I'd probably only come back here for the lunch specials. I'm not sure the quality justifies the dinner prices."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Not too crowded for a Friday night. Opted for the traditional seating. Had a couple of roles and tried a couple sake samplers. Overall a good time and would come again."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a long-standing, family-run restaurant for sushi, teppanyaki and other traditional Japanese foods.   I got the pork katsu curry and it wasn't bad. The katsu was crispy and the curry sauce was kinda tasty. The complimentary miso soup was bland, but it had noodle and a slice of kamaboko.   Tatami rooms and teppan room are available.   We had a birthday at our party and the restaurant gave her a complimentary birthday ice cream. She got two scoops of ice cream (green tea and mango) with whip cream and candle on top.  3 stars!!  Osaka Japanese Bistro is almost yummylicious!!"}
{"text":"i like this location the best!!!! waiters are nice and very friendly and we love the tatami room and i don't know why their food is better. I just love the atmosphere and everything about it."}
{"text":"The service here is exceptional! The food is really fresh and the presentation is exceptional. Need towels in the bathroom. Had the sashimi sald and the green tea. Green tea was amazing and bottomless! Would come again. My 13 year loved the ambiance."}
{"text":"Bad service.. nothing special with food.. too upset to mention what kind of service they gave us...  just a waste of time to go here.."}
{"text":"Simply beautiful restaurant. I was only getting takeout, so I didn't get to experience it. The tempura and Karl I sticks were perfect .--except for the price. For 6.50, there were only two small 4\" sticks with 4 tiny bits of meat on each. I do realize that this is a nice restaurant, but it was so miserly that it lost a star. I would love to come back, but perhaps not when I get a craving and just need a quick snack."}
{"text":"Fantastic service, excellent variety of sushi  and sake!!! Restaurant is quite, quaint, and fast service :)"}
{"text":"Our waiter made some suggestions and we went ahead and ordered them. not disappointed!  Enjoyed everything and the sushi was fresh as always!"}
{"text":"After a long day of moving in the scorching 110+ degree weather, I decided to reward myself with some Japanese food. A quick Yelp search and Osaka was our choice. We arrived at 5:30 and were immediately seated. What's cool is that they have the traditional Japanese floor seating with an American twist. In an authentic Japanese floor seating, the patrons sit directly on the floor with specific seating styles and arrangements. The one at Osaka had an opening under the table so people could put their legs in it as if sitting at a regular table... Just lowered.... If that made any sense... Haha.  The menu was extensive. Did I mention they also have Teppanyaki? We opted for the regular Japanese food. This is what we ordered:  Treasure Island Roll: $14.95 Salmon, Capers, Sliced Onion Topped with Hamachi, Thin Sliced Lemon Served with Tataki Sauce, Masago, Scallions -- I think this looked better on the menu than in person. Dont get me wrong, it was good, but not for $15.  Hamachi Maki: $8.95 chopped yellow tail, scallions -- For a simple dish, I rather enjoyed it. It wasn't \"knock my socks off\" kinda dish but I'm a huge Hamachi fan. Would I order again? Possibly if it was a wee bit cheaper.   Fire Roll: $5.95 extremely spicy miki special roll -- It was just meh. Just a filler dish for a cheap price.  Zaru Soba: $6.95 cold buckwheat noodle w/soba sauce (Substituted with Cold Udon Noodles) -- Very refreshing dish. Its 110+ outside and this cold dish was perfect. It was simple yet delicious.  Seafood Okonomiyaki -- I forget what was in this, but it was a wee bit on the sweeter side. I do remember there was lots of shrimp and scallops in it.  Overall, I would give this place a 3.5. My iced green tea was always full. Service was outstanding. I would definitely eat here again... but it is on the pricey side."}
{"text":"I'd give 1/2 star, but Yelp doesn't allow that. Just finished eating here for lunch...did you know they import bugs from a farm?! We didn't either until there was a bug affixed to my chop stick. Asked for the manager, that was a struggle too...finally got to talk to the owner Gene who informed us the bug must have come from the farm. No sorry, just information of where the bug used to reside. So if you are up for a little excitement in your dining experience, try the salad and ask for extra imported bugs."}
{"text":"Since I don't think I'll make it to JP anytime soon, I like to believe this is just about the same!!! Nice atmosphere, yummy food, & a decent wait staff!!!"}
{"text":"Love Osaka.  Food is always good. Sushi is fresh.  But our draw is always the teppanyaki grill. Oh the fried rice.  I could eat that for days.    The chefs are fun and they always do a little show.  Some are better then others.  But the food is always so good!!"}
{"text":"I haven't had any of the food here yet, but the mojitos are amazing!  I came here to see a friend play in a jazz trio, which I really enjoyed, as well.  Will have to try the food sometime when I'm here next..."}
{"text":"Service was seriously on point. Amazingly friendly staff. As soon as I removed my chopsticks from the wrapper, someone removed the trash from the table. Everything came out perfectly and fast. Fish was fresh as can be, flavors were more unique then I've encountered. Every dish was a pleasant surprise. Wish I had photos, but we ate everything too fast! Can't wait to come back...like in an hour ;)"}
{"text":"Food was good, wait staff was nice, chef's cook with good quality and nice speed. Only thing I hate about this place is how small it is. It's always over crowded and people always squeezing by next to you behind you bumping into each other. If they moved to a bigger locale I'd be there all the time. I'd recommend but won't return to the sardine can."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night. We were seated right away. The place wasn't overly busy. As you walk in there's a photo of Guy Fieri from Diners Drive Ins and Dives. This is definitely a Dive. And not in the good sense of the word.   We asked for water and waitress brought us two small glasses of water. Waited over 15 minutes to order. I ordered the chicken teppan dinner. Waitress said it would take 45 minutes. What the hell? Are they butchering the meat on premises? She suggested chicken teriyaki and tempura. Tempura was flavorless, like eating deep fried styrofoam with a forgettable dipping sauce. Soup was so salty we couldn't eat it. Cucumber salad was decent, but very small. My husband's dinner was served 10 minutes before mine.  My chicken was cold, overcooked with very little sauce. Waitress never checked in on us but was super attentive to the table next to us. I flagged her down for water refills, which never came. A server passed us several times with water pitchers and refilled glasses at the adjoining tables but not ours. I had to go to the bar to get refills. Husband, who has a stomach of steel came home with a sour stomach. Maybe it's a good place for sushi but not for cooked food. This is a must miss in my opinion."}
{"text":"The BEST spot for teppan in Las Vegas. My husband and I love this place! It's the chef that really makes the experience with teppan and chef phong at this location is fantastic! Such a friendly guy and his food is exceptional. Tonight my husband ordered the lobster and it was some of the best we have ever had. The rolls are quite good as well and they also have the traditional Japanese area with the low tables and floor mats which is very cool. Definitely worth giving it a try, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I went to an early dinner here with 2 coworkers. We walked in around 4:45 pm. The place was pretty dead and we even for a second thought that they were closed. Guess we were just early! We all ordered the shrimp & chicken off the teppan grill menu. The only seasoning I saw them put on the chicken, shrimp, rice & veggies was just salt, pepper and butter. I felt it needed more flavor. Something to set it apart from regular old chicken & shrimp. I feel like Geisha House gives their teppan meals more flavor than salt & pepper. Overall, portion sizes were good like they always should be. You leave full and satisfied. Our chef was awesome and nice. Our waiter was super nice and even chatted with us for a little. He wasn't awkward or antisocial. We had a good dinner."}
{"text":"Take your shoes off and stay a while... Traditional Japanese dining ,private booth, Teppanyaki room, sushi bar etc....  Great Late Night option!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here on first trip to Vegas; and we weren't really expecting much because it's a little in coast and were from the coast. But we were wrong. Their sushi is exceptionally good. We got the tons special and it can definitely feed more then 2! We also got a few other things too. The service was really good; our server David was very attentive. They have some food options for desert. I would for sure recommend banana foster cake!"}
{"text":"We usually come to osaka during lunch for happy hour since its about $4-7 per order of sushi.  What we usually order are:   Tiger Roll: it has a little kick of spice-ness to it & I am not a fan of it because i dont really enjoy spicy food.  Yum Yum: Plain Japanese Lasagna: one of my personal favorites, it has a a melted cream cheese on top of it & i love it.  Shrimp Fried Rice: I had better fried rice.   The service is consistent each time I have been there and the servers always seem nice."}
{"text":"I have been here twice, and Osaka does not stand out when I try to think about a sensational Japanese restaurant in Vegas. There are three requirements which I look for in a restaurant; service, deals, and food quality.   I would not suggest Osaka as a place to go catch up with friends, because you will end up leaving frustrated. The service was lacking. We came around lunch, and it was quiet, yet we were missing many basic essentials such as plates when our appetizers had come out and drinks were not refilled regularly.   The food was decent, but nothing particularly special. I ordered the lunch bento box with broiled unagi and grilled salmon. My salmon was on the dry side and I had to douse it in lemon juice and toss it in the excess miso dressing from my salad. The unagi was delicious, but it was the most anorexic eel I have ever eaten. It was mostly skin, but that was cooked beautifully with a nice crunch. It came with rice, a salad, two pieces of gyoza, and two pieces of California roll for 15 dollars. This was a decent price, but I was left underwhelmed.   I was looking at their lunch special which gave you a choice of one main for 8 bucks. Maybe that would be classified as a deal, if someone tries it, please write if it is worth giving Osaka another chance."}
{"text":"Food was okay. Grilled salmon was good. Yakitori portion was small and overcooked, meat was too tough and dry.  One thing we laughed so hard was that there was a menu saying \"kintama udon\" in Japanese writing. Do you know what that means? \"BALLS UDON\" yes, the balls!! Men's testicles!! LOL I've never heard such thing in my life! I wonder if they knew it when they created their menu. Lol We were laughing so hard that the waiter guy asked us if we are okay lol then we explained about the kintama udon thing and he said \"oh yeah, every Japanese customer laughs\" oh man I died that day."}
{"text":"I am use to going here for teppan (chicken, shrimp, steak) and sushi and have always had a good experience. Better than Benihana! Service and staff is friendly and helpful. This was my first time here for lunch. Prices are great. I also love that they offer half rolls on some of their sushi rolls. I got the Chicken Teriyaki w/ Shrimp Tempura, comes with rice and miso soup. It was very tasty. And it was a good amount of food for $8.50. I also got Unagi sushi, which was okay. I got to sample around at some of my friends food...Hamachi Kama which I've never had was yummy and the Uni roll (wasn't as bad as it looks:) We also got different desserts at the end, the Chocolate Tempura Ice Cream was heavy but yummy, tasted like a funnel cake with ice cream. The Chocolate Soufflé was delicious, the warm chocolate filling made the dish. My favorite was the Flan (yes at a Japanese restaurant), it was reminiscent of creme brulee. The mochi wasn't great, might have been in the freezer too long."}
{"text":"Maybe I just dont like teppan?  A friend and I came here to eat the lunch special teppan, $8.95-10.95 for chicken/beef/shrimp teppan with soup and salad. While the teppan chef was quite friendly and very entertaining and the service was very good, the food was just 'meh'. My shrimp dish was about four shrimp and a mix of sub-par vegetables with some brown rice and sauce. Thats it. Im not sure what I was expecting, but I think it was more than this. Im wondering if this restaurant just floats on the 'excitement' of the teppan experience?  Anyway, we also got a sushi roll (Katie Maki) just to try it out and it wasnt great either. It was huge with tons of rice that was falling apart. Not great. Overall the experience was decent only because I was there with a good friend, but I wouldnt return. Maybe at night when all the teppan are going it is worth it, but if the food is the same, it isnt worth it to me, even then."}
{"text":"Delicious baked mussels and fresh spicy Tuna."}
{"text":"The food is good but not great enough to justify their prices. You will leave here still hungry and with an outrageous bill. For 2 people our bill was more than my car payment is."}
{"text":"Osaka is a great little hole in the wall spot in Eastern for late night Happy Hour sushi!  I've been here multiple times with groups of friends.  I've tried multiple items such as spicy edamame, shrimp tempura, tiger roll, shrimp fried rice and mochi.   Tonight, I ordered the Combo A and shared with a friend. We ordered for the Appetizer - NZ mussels  Standard roll - Nevada  Signature roll - Oh kamisama   The appetizer NZ mussels were to die for! Most fanciest mussels I've eaten especially with the garnished masago! The sauce on it was so good we dipped it into our Nevada roll which was also amazing. It was almost like a California roll, but instead of crab it was shrimp which was a lighter taste. Then the grand finale with the Oh Kamisama was the cherry on top. All the sauces with the perfect amount of kick balanced out on the roll!   Overall, great service, attentive & quick!"}
{"text":"Yes! Yes! Yes!!!!  I was fortunate enough to be introduced to Osaka's for my future brother in law's birthday. I like sushi, so I was anticipating your usual run of the mill sushi, not expecting anything super fantastic.  Boy was I wrong!  I can't say enough great things about Osaka. The food is excellent! It tastes fresh always, and the variety of rolls is outstanding! There is something for every palate! Even my fiancé who was not so keen on sushi, at least once a week asks me, \"so when do you want to go back to Osaka's?\"   The atmosphere is great! The minute you walk through the door you get greeted by everyone (or so it seems) you can sit in tables close to the bar, but I believe to get the full experience you need to sit in the Japanese room. Remember to take off your shoes!  All in all, if you want a sushi place with great friendly service, great atmosphere, and all with great prices, come to Osaka! I promise you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I love eating here.  If you are a salmon skin fan, like I am, try their Salmon Skin Salad.  The sashimi is great and the staff is very nice too."}
{"text":"Amazing selection of specialty rolls and appetizers. Unfortunately they don't have AYCE... BUT the rolls are so good, it's worth it. They have a ton of unique and tasty sauces and make everything they serve taste like a little piece of heaven. Favorites include: The Virgin Roll (a great starter sushi roll for those just venturing into sushi town), Japanese Lasagna, Lisa Lisa, U-My Roll (which is a mouth full, for sure).   They have a bunch of different seating options (Dining Room, Japanese style tables, and Teppan) and it's a really cute place. Overall, one of my favorites and it's not far from the strip (at least it doesn't seem that far, but nothing does when it tastes good!!)."}
{"text":"This place gets points for ambiance, they have intimate rooms with tatami mats where you mimic the Japanese custom of eating while sitting on the ground. The service was speedy and attentive as well. After ten p.m. Until closing at 2:00 they offer discounted dishes, and this is the menu we ordered off of. The seafood salad was fresh, but it had crab in it and I prefer Tuna or salmon this is just a personal preference thing. The rolls were all very fresh. They're shrimp tempura was excellent. This place is great for a date."}
{"text":"Ummmm...my mouth is watering just thinking of the Kai's special roll. My family enjoys a dinner here almost weekly. The fish is always fresh and when we walk in the staff knows to bring us our large hot sake and beer order without having to even ask. I always bring visiting friends and local friends in and not one person hasn't enjoyed the yummy sushi. We do tend to stick to rolls but I've had shabu shabu once and it was darn good too. I tried almost all the well known sushi places along eastern ave and this is hands down my fav!"}
{"text":"Looks like Osaka fixed some of there issues. Service was above average and the food was solid as always. Sushi still tends to not taste the freshest in town but is adequate. The teppan tables are the highlight of the restaurant and depending on the chef can be a pleasure to experience."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for many years-in the 15 years we lived in Las Vegas and 9 years since we've left but returned to visit family. This review is a compilation of all our visits. Osaka is one of our favorite places especially as far as ambiance in LV.   We tend to go to dinner early so there are fewer people and we have the back to ourselves. The sushi bar and bar area gets pretty noisy during happy hour as does the teppanyaki room. So, going early has lots of benefits. We enjoy sitting at the sushi bar on occasion but my favorite is the quiet tatami rooms in the back. The tatami rooms are low tables and seats where you remove your shoes before heading down into a cozy space.   We are such creatures of habit when we do sushi. We always get a hot saki, a Kirin beer, miso soup and shrimp & veggie tempura. Then we change it up-though hubs often has a Chiarashi bowl so he gets lots of different things. They have updated the menu since we started and have a good variety of selections. Osaka does a really good Chiarashi. In fact, I think everything we've had is good.   The past few times we've been there has been with friends for a special occasion and they prefer the teppanyaki tables. We wouldn't go to the teppanyaki table on our own but it's it's nice to do the tables for a special occasion. We usually reserve the whole table and have even had to add a couple seats to fit everyone. They entertain the group though it makes chatting a bit more difficult except to the ones closest to you. We have had steak or shrimp which they cook nicely-despite all the activities on the cook top. The meat come with rice and veggies.  We do recommend Osaka. It is a wonderful place with a variety of areas in one restaurant to have a nice quiet dinner, a fun happy hour or special occasions."}
{"text":"Great place for sushi! Amazing menu.  Call for a reservation if u want a private table tho."}
{"text":"Worst sushi ever. For the owner - Please step up and do better. It's shame to serve such a good traditional food in  very poorly way."}
{"text":"Always a great experience. Quick and friendly service and most of all incredible food. Little pricey, but you get what you pay for.  Fried oreos are pretty incredible."}
{"text":"I don't usually write reviews for restaurants unless I am super compelled to. Which I am. Osaka Japanese Bistro is absolutely amazing! I ordered a salmon nigiri sushi and Tonkotsu. The cuts were delicious and high quality. The Tonkotsu still haunts my mouth. I was in Osaka, Japan last year and the authenticity of this place is very, very spot on. I highly recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"Location feels dated, and it's in a converted night club club or something, it has no windows, feels like a shady basement somewhere. A lot of the detailing is left over from the 1980s. Sushi bar is cramped and boring, only noise is from the tv showing some random show. Though their servers are friendly and helpful, the chefs are not. I dislike the feel of this place immensely.  Sushi and cooking is very average for above average prices. It's fresh enough, but flavors don't pop, nothing stood out, and a lot of their recipes are dated. And the half rolls on their happy hour menu really don't save you much.  They have Tatami rooms and a small teppanyaki grill area that feels like a fire hazard. Area of town is sketchy, parking lot feels unsafe after dark. Not going back."}
{"text":"best sushi place in Vegas! Very fresh fish, great selection too.... if you eat kosher this is a good idea sense there are more roll options."}
{"text":"A good place to get away from the Vegas strip. Sushi is decent and not as over priced as other places."}
{"text":"Amazing food, BUT we arrived for our 7:30 reservation and a cook had called out sick so we had to wait until 8:30 to eat. We were disappointed in the wait time but the food was tasty. I'm sure it was an off night so we will probably try it again."}
{"text":"I randomly stumbled upon this little gem on my way to the camera shop down the street. I came for lunch on a Thursday and there were 5 other patrons there, who seemed to be regulars. This is a non-tourist, low-key casual spot; my kind of place when I'm bumming it during the week.  The decor is a bit dated, but that's irrelevant because the food and service make up for it in every way.  Our waitress, Misu, was sweet and attentive and the sushi was ultra fresh.  I'll definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying that I am SUPER picky about sushi.   This place has a really cool ambiance, with traditional-style seating in the back which we loved. They had some great specials and a very extensive menu.   I got the california crunch rolls, dragon rolls, and seaweed salad, which is my go-to at any sushi place. The rolls were huge and so fresh and tasty.   As a group we shared mochi and the tempura bananas for dessert - all the desserts are HUGE (don't let the pictures fool you) and delicious.   Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Very good quality and great prices! Best of all you can get delivery from them :) I'm always skeptical getting sushi delivery because it's not a food that sits well for long. Tried the delivery though and it was so fresh! Definitely recommend this place if you want quality but don't want to break the bank."}
{"text":"Now that Yelp is offering delivery from so many excellent restaurants, there really should be an option to mark the review \"in-house, \"take out,\" or \"delivery.\"   I've eaten at Osaka once before, in-house, for a birthday treat. It was before Yelp, but I would have posted a very favorable review for it back then. My only criticism would have been that they didn't serve pickles with the rice.  This review is for their delivery service through Yelp.  I recently reviewed another sushi establishment based on a delivery order. I was disappointed then; this experience was so much better!  The sushi we ordered was prepared beautiful, generous but not overly big slivers of fresh, sweet fish on expertly prepared rice. And the presentation, for delivery food, was excellent. They even included that plastic \"grass,\" which is annoying, but at least is says \"we tried!\" All the boxes were labeled with the menu item they included, a really nice touch! And the order was correct; a blessing. We asked for extra chopsticks and wasabi, and they sent us service for eight, with enough wasabi and ginger to keep our nasal passages clean for a month!  We ordered tempura as well, and that's where this establishment lost its fifth star. The tempura was a bit heavy and oily. The dense oily texture was due in part, I'm sure, to \"delivery time lapse,\" because tempura is meant to be eaten hot out of the oil. Even a few minutes left sitting will cause it become oily. And reheating is problematic, as the shrimp will be over cooked and the veggies limp. So even though it's really no one's fault but mine (for ordering it), I still had to pull that last star.   This place is not cheap. You can balance the price with the quality though, and order judiciously. And certainly, a couple of rolls and a side would be a better value, but I prefer traditionally prepared nigiri, so we ordered no rolls.  We'll be returning to the restaurant later this month for my birthday; a Living Social deal so very budget friendly. And I can heartily recommend this restaurant for its delivery service! Well, except the tempura, but if you order fried food for delivery, it's your fault!"}
{"text":"Osaka !!! Yes yes finally some fresh sushi this side of town. The menu is large so bring your appetite. Sushi bar , main dining , Teppan grill as well as a bar with live music. John the waiter was amazing and helped with wonderful suggestions. I look forward to another dining experience."}
{"text":"I give this place 3.5 stars. The only time I have really come here is late night during happy hour. Not sure if I would come in during non-happy hour. I usually order sushi rolls, and maybe their sake sampler or just water. I like their Tatami rooms but the place is older and activity in the surrounding area can feel sketchy. I double check my car and make sure I don't have any items of valuable visible from the outside to tempt some passerby from possibly breaking in. The restaurant itself is borderline dive status but the staff is nice and friendly. Although I did seem to almost get into a debate with one of the servers, one time, over the correct pronunciation of lychee. Whenever I would say, \"lie-chee\" he would respond back saying, \"lee-chee\". I'm sure he pronounces tomatoe as \"toe-mah-toe,\" but I digress.  Never had an issue with the place being super busy. They have a Teppanyaki grill area but I have never tried it so I cannot give an opinion. The food is decent and their prices are more or so on par with many of the other sushi places here in town. Maybe a couple items priced higher than other places I have been to. I am a repeat customer and will stop by again if it's during happy hour and I happen to be in the area."}
{"text":"Went here with a groupon discount and had Zach as our tepanyaki chef. Very nice guy. Overall, not a bad experience -- but there were a few things about the place that made me question it's direction. Staff is dressed nicely but offered nothing more than just average service. The only person that was personable was of course, the chef. But the menu was made out of laminated paper in a ringed binder (though the binder was personalized, the quality was not much better than a regular binder you would use at an office). There were so many options of drinks, smoothies, sushi , and combinations of plates that it was a tad bit overwhelming. Later, we found out the desserts had its own menu. There were paintings of what looked like jazz singers on the wall of the tepanyaki section which kind of confused us as the rest of the theme was Japanese. The sushi we had was so-so quality.   I've been to a handful of hibachi places numerous times and this is not at all the worst I've seen.  I would kindly recommend a more consistent theme throughout, a little more focus on the ambiance, customer service, and quality of food.   But overall -- it was filling and the prices were great."}
{"text":"I was recommended to try the sushi here by a friend of mine and was pretty good. I ordered a white tiger roll, banzai roll, and a oh kamisama. They gave the option of either a full roll or half. I ordered half rolls. The price was right and the service was great. This place does not offer all you can eat. I also tried the OG special which was similar to crispy spicy tuna appetizer. The only negative thing is the parking. It's real small and if the place gets busy you may have to park in the parking lot next to business. There is a server there named Jared that helped us and he was great. Very attentive and nice. Anyone that goes there be sure to ask for him. You won't be disappointed. Everything I ordered was recommended by him and was delicious."}
{"text":"I would like to note that the front entrance now has an automatic door, which is much safer and easier to open.   We recently dined in the Hibachi section of the restaurant. It was my daughters first time experiencing this type of meal entertainment. Our chef was newer, as he explained, but quite skilled and entertaining. He kept my daughter attention as she was quite captivated by all the flames and hand tricks. The food was cook to our liking and tasted great, as always. The servers were attentive to our needs and stayed on top of refills. Thanks for the great service and food as always!"}
{"text":"Best spicy adamame in town! The service and food are always consistent. I come here weekly and I don't get tired of it,happy hour is my favorite. Definetly one of my favorite sushi places."}
{"text":"Very unique place. A bit intimidating from the outside as there are no windows, just a door. The menu is vast. Ramen was not worth the calories but the fried rice and spicy tuna were excellent. I'd say stick with the sushi if you come here. Service was great."}
{"text":"Not really understanding the high reviews folks.  Food: Bento box with assorted sashimi and tempura, bento box with beef teriyaki and tempura and unagi don. The food was just so-so. I didn't like that they did not serve miso soup with the meal, but instead some soy sauce soup with a few strands of somen noodle in it. It tasted like soy sauce water - yuk. The unagi don was large but was served in a bowl instead of the traditional black laquer box.   Authenticity: Although the owner and waitress were Japanese (props there), the sushi chef was not (doh!).  Location: conveniently located near Kumon, but we will not be back."}
{"text":"I have had food from this restaurant/location over the years and have found that their quality has gone down with every year that passes. Today, I placed a fairly pricey (approx $80) order with them where it was delivered to my home via a delivery service.  The order consisted of multiple Philadelphia rolls, Cal-Vada Maki Roll, multiple San Diego Salmon, etc...  the salmon within the sushi was too thick, and 'gristly'. Additionally, when I received the order I found there was absolutely NO wasabe or ginger provided, none! I mean, what sushi establishment does that??  I hear that the other location is far better than the one in Henderson.  I will need to check it out.  In the meantime, I will be patronizing Sai Sushi as my new local go-to sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"This is really sad, as Osaka used to be relatively good.  Here, specifically are my issues from my visit last night:  1.  WAY too expensive for what you receive. 2.  Quality of fish is near rock bottom.  Toro at market price ($24) was not fatty, nor do I suspect, tuna. 3. Tako was just chewy rubber 4.  It took forever to get a carryout order.  45 minutes to be exact.  Sushi Wa is MUCH better.  I think I was spoiled by Yoshida's in San Marino, CA.  Definitely the best"}
{"text":"I've heard so many great things about Osaka Japanese Bistro so of course the hubby and I had to try it when we were in Las Vegas last week.  Both him and I love sushi so we had high expectations going in here.  We chose to dine in one of their tatami rooms since we really wanted to experience the authentic Japanese style of dining.  The tatami rooms do provide somewhat a feeling of intimacy and privacy so it was a nice change.  We ordered their sashimi platter (ahi tuna, yellow tail tuna, salmon, albacore), kim chee, miso soup (perfect blend of sweet and salty), a kamikaze roll (eel roll with sweet sauce), spider roll (deep fried soft shell crab roll with sprouts), white tiger (tuna roll flame cooked on top with a white sauce), tuna-poki (our favorite of all dishes, the slices were super thin and fresh, tossed in a light sesame oil dressing with sweet thin slices of seaweed), and a Nigori sake sampler (apple, strawberry, and lychee flavor - our favorite).    We were pleasantly surprised that everything tasted so fresh and all the dishes came out fast.  Prices were not too bad considering we were in Las Vegas.  We spent a total of $130 total for all our dishes including drinks and tip so not bad for a really good sushi joint.  Would definitely love to come back here when we're in town again."}
{"text":"I'm rating 2 stars because the food arrived very quickly. I have been eating at this restaurant since my cousins family opened. Although the food arrived quickly it was cold and the portions were very small. It was average teriyaki at best.  Very tough slice of beef and very dry. Gyoza was over cooked."}
{"text":"Vast menu and really well executed Japanese fairs.  Casual yet elegantly presented decor.  You will enjoy coming back to try new dishes/styles"}
{"text":"We unfortunately got a chef on his first night and we were his first table. He came to the table and seemed quite unsure of himself when he lit the grill the flames were very high and he let it stay lit until it burned away. He was only able to start to cook one thing at once, until he was finishing cooking my lobster. He then added raw chicken to the grill and used the same spatula and knife and than tossed my lobster with it. This was a cross contamination and it was disgusting to watch. We ordered fried rice and he left egg shells in it. He did no special tricks except trying to set the onion on fire, but he even messed that up. He kept dropping the towels and than picking them up to wipe of his spatula and knife. The worst part was when he put the steaks on the grill.  One was bright red and looked fresh the other one was brown. We pointed out the steak being brown he said it was only cut an hour ago. He offered to put teriyaki sauce on it to cover up the mistake. When he put it on my plate it had a bad smell. I refused to eat it. We explained to the waiter who was nice that we were not happy. They still made us pay for all the meals, but took of a small amount for the steak. This was a terrible experience and unfortunately my Mother's birthday and now her memory of her special day is tainted."}
{"text":"I always pass this place and very committed to my sushi bars. BUT this place blew me away and this place is amazing I am definitely coming back thank you Osaka !!!"}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place in town. Love all their rolls, they fish are really fresh and the chefs there are very creative. Everything I even try there are very yummy. The services are alway friendly. And they open late at night. This is one of those hidden neighborhood jem.  ALSO, lots of bad reviews regarding Osake are for the other one by Lake Mead, most people mistake the two. I been to that one too and they are one of the worst. It's night and day. Please don't let that mislead you."}
{"text":"I came here on a Tuesday night with a group of friends.  They all had been there before (some of them often enough that they know the staff by name) and raved about the sushi.  I love the idea that they have different rooms depending on what you are ordering.    The sushi menu is quite extensive, especially the rolls section, which is pretty typical here in Las Vegas.  I felt like it was a little hard for me to focus and choose what I wanted but I did appreciate that the rolls all had pictures so I could scan through pretty quickly.  As much as I wanted to love the sushi, I just didn't.  I like to fancy myself a purist.  Seasoned rice, fresh fish, a little wasabi and soy sauce to heighten flavor.  The rice wasn't seasoned and it was soggy.  If the foundation isn't solid the whole thing falls apart and I think that is what happened here.    The sushi here was just your cut rate standard Americanized sushi.  I don't think you would get a bad meal here but if you're really into sushi, you won't get a good one here either."}
{"text":"Recent visit tells me this place is still consistently very good. We've had the sushi, donburi, udon and combo teriyaki dishes and all were high quality. The decor could use an update but the food is reliably excellent!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in town! Always fresh and great customer service:) Asakusa roll is my fave!"}
{"text":"I come out to this place at least twice a month, usually during happy hour from 10 pm to 2 am.  The location is suspect but this is the very first sushi place in LV so there you go.  The late night menu is awesome.  Ultimate osaka roll, japanese lasagna and kai's special are my favorites.  You can get stuffed with the happy hour appetizers too.  Try the chicken wings, the kalbi sticks and the fried rice.  Oh and the udon too.  I am not sure why some prior reviews say this place is expensive.  In my opinion, this place is very reasonable and I have not been disappointed.   P.S. Green tea tiramisu is really good.  A little expensive at $8 for a slice but splurge once in a while."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE Osaka. My primary reason for dining there is their Teppan Grill. The chefs create a fun, entertaining show while preparing your food in front of you, however you like it prepared. It's great for the kids (and they have a toy filled treasure chest for them to dig into!). Some of the dishes can get just a little bit pricey but you get a TON of items included with your dish. For example, I get the filet mignon ($28) but this includes salad, soup, your entree, appetizer shrimp, rice, veggies AND ice cream! The servers are friendly and they come back often to check on you and fill up your drinks (my pet peeve). Can't afford the dinner time prices? Stop in for lunch from 12-3pm and enjoy your favorites from $8.95!  Make sure you sign up for their email club before you go. You'll get a 10% off coupon and also get a VIP Osaka card while your there. You can earn money for future Osaka visits. Enjoy :)"}
{"text":"Pros: fast, friendly and helpful service, delicious food, beautiful restaurant, and comfortable environment Cons: none Let me start off by saying this place is amazing! I work near this restaurant and am always looking for a fast, affordable meal. Their bento boxes on the lunch menu have to be my favorite thing to eat here despite many sushi and meat choices. Overall, I've experienced good and okay service here but mainly good. One waitress is very friendly here and she always remembers me and my order. Since I'm trying to devour a usually delicate meal in a very short time in order to get to work, I appreciate that she expedites my order. On the occasions I don't have to rush, I enjoy the tranquil environment and dim lighting. It's very relaxing and the noise level never becomes too loud during the day. The chefs are amazing at their designs and food presentation as well as conversing with customers. It's nice to come here with friends and family because there's something for everyone. Everything about the restaurant makes it a gem. In short, I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Great Las Vegas staple....sushi is great fresh and prepared wonderfully. What a great place to enjoy Japanese in Vegas"}
{"text":"Quality, mouth melting, fresh sushi and sashimi. Most of the nigiri and roll sushi pricing was spot on (reasonable esp for Vegas) but the pricing on few of the items left me scratching my head wondering if they came sprinkled with gold flakes on top. Overall good place to go for sushi. Service was satisfactory; No complaints nor compliments (We did have a fairly large group though). Seating is either sushi bar, table, or tatami. They also have a few teppan grill tables."}
{"text":"Came with a big group of family and had a blast at the teppan grill.  Our chef was fun and charismatic and catered to the young-un in our group.  Food was yum.  $2 draft Kirin during NFL games!  Thank goodness for Thursday night football!"}
{"text":"I was immediately surprised by the way we had to take off our shoes and sit at the table on pillows- it made the experience a lot more authentic. The portions were a bit smaller than I would like, probably because I was so used to the sushi buffets in the east coast. Great quality food, although the mochi ice creams were tiny. Would reccomend if you're in vegas and do not want to eat on the crowded strip."}
{"text":"Beautiful food and service! What a lovely way to start our holiday week with Family! We already are planning to come back!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. 911 Rolls are so freaking amazing. The food is great and the service is even better. I love sitting at the sushi bar and watching them make everything."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place in all of Vegas.  Fast turn over and fresh fish. Great late night specials and excellent service.  A must try!"}
{"text":"When craving sushi late in the evening, generally my friends and I head over to Osaka as they have a great happy hour menu available a few hours before they close. Service is consistent prices fair and food is pretty good.   I admit though, 9 times out of 10, I am eating here around midnight or 1AM, had a few drinks and just looking to fulfill my sushi craving. So when it comes to eating there during non happy hour time, I can not remark on the quality of food, service or pricing. That my friends, I will leave up to my fellow yelpers. :)"}
{"text":"I have been going to Osaka since 2005!  It's AMAZING!!!!  I mean, quality fish...friendly service.  The 777 is my FAVORITE!!!!!  When we lived overseas for a few years we'd come back once a year.  I'd make sure to head straight to Osaka for my 777 and much more!!  Whew...really amazing place...you have to try it!"}
{"text":"Always come here for the night special. Salmon kama, black sausage, fried rice, spicy tuna, Kalbi sticks, Lisa Lisa role, kamikaze, lasagna roll n top off with tempura ice cream."}
{"text":"This place rules, I visit it every time I visit vegas. It is a hole in the wall, sketchy strip mall location and feels like it used to be a bar or something with the weird hallway entrance. They are open late and have an awesome late night happy hour. The staff is excellent and the food is great. They will make sushi off menu and will do a very thinly sliced japanese tuna that no other place has been able to get right for me. I have tried other menu items and everything has been great, good portion size and value to go along with the great service and quality."}
{"text":"I didn't like Osaka at all! Service was horrible, we had to ask the waitress twice to get our drinks and the shrimp and fish weren't fresh.  I also didn't like that they do not have AYCE.   Our rolls were okay, I would never go here again!!!"}
{"text":"Decent japanese in vegas area. Usually,people go to japanese all you can eat but quality isnt good. Osaka had very good quality of fish."}
{"text":"Pocket of aces is delicious. Now with that said, that was the only dish we enjoyed. It's open until 2am which is great for late night sushi. And they have late night specials. Maybe it was the sushi chef we had, not sure. Last, the mochi ice cream wasn't good. How is that possible, right?! It was crumbley.  :-/ not going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I came here when evening with my family and we did to her Baci Grill my son had such a nice time I had the lobster and the scallops everything was traditional everything was fine we sat with some good people it's a little bit hard to find unless you have your navigator on because you will drive right past it I've done it twice Don't forget that if you come at an odd time you might have to wait for seating so that they have a Knouff to start their presentation but they do the traditional volcano and anything that you would get any hibachi restaurant They do have a full bar It's been around for years so I don't know why anyone would give it a bad review"}
{"text":"Desserts are excellent. Fried oreo was yummy. Sorry to inform everyone but happy hour equals half a roll! Just not what I am used to when I go for happy hour."}
{"text":"We went there on St. Patrick's day just to do something different. The place wasn't very crowded which was probably normal on this kind of holiday. The food was pretty good and drinks reasonably priced. They forgot about our California Rolls and when my boyfriend asked the waitress she said that they had brought them lol. Well, I guess we ate them, forgot about it and asked for more lol . Our waitress neglected us a little bit even though the place wasn't that busy yesterday. We need to try another location."}
{"text":"Anything less than 4 stars is blasphemy.  If this place were in San Diego they would give Ota-san a run for his money!!"}
{"text":"Great lunch menu. Service, good.  Food, delicious.   The reason it doesn't get 5 stars is the restaurant itself.  Very dingy, needs updating, restrooms smelled bad, carpets looked gross.   Just close your eyes and open your mouth and you'll be alright!"}
{"text":"We went in for a late lunch, kind of in a hurry. We picked 3 lunch special rolls, the 911, the white tiger, and Kai's special. We also ordered a full Tropical roll. The service was prompt and it was the best sushi we've had in a long time."}
{"text":"What a great place for a tapanyaki nights! The food is amazing. I couldn't stop complimenting through out the entire dinner course!"}
{"text":"I love sitting in the Tatami Room. It's cozy and comfy. Watari Bune 55 \"Ferry Boat\" Sake - pricey but smooth. I love the Late Night Menu!! 10pm - 2am Everything is good! The Philadelphia Roll is my guilty pleasure. Cajun Crunch is divine chef special Nabeyaki Udon is a fave. Save room for dessert"}
