{"text":"We were so pleasantly surprised to discover that West Side Slices is really good.  We ordered the Chicken Bacon Ranch pizza which included Chicken, Bacon, Ranch, Cheddar, and Mozzarella, as well as, another pizza with Italian Sausage, Meatballs,Green Peppers, Mushrooms, and White Onion  We paid $2.00 extra for cheese stuffed crust on each pizza; it was delicious.  I would suggest asking for extra sauce to dip the stuffed cheese crust.  It's closer to having a big fat bread stick attached to the pizza.    We also ordered very good chicken wings: Garlic Parmesan and  Sweet Baby Ray's barbecue.  The prices for each item were very good--another plus.  I would absolutely recommend giving them a try.  We have needed some new pizza at Kamm's Corners.  I think we have a winner!"}
{"text":"I'll give one star for good customer service, because when I called the employee was pleasant and made sure my order was correct for delivery.  My order took an order to arrive, even though the delivery guy said it was \"a slow night\". My wrap was cold, the fries inedible because they were rock hard at this point. My husband's pizza was just ok, nothing special.  Disappointed all around."}
{"text":"This place is filthy inside. Tables were dirty, notice the unidentifiable goo in the photo that Ended up on my hand, it's hard to imagine the tables have ever been been wiped down. The Manager stands in the front doorway to smoke making customers walk through it. The pizza by the slice was old and really not good, we ordered while we waited for a calzone which we ended up walking out without after observing some sketchy behavior which made us not care to put anything else near our mouth.   The management was rude even just when interacting to order. I would not recommend this place to a homeless person eating from their dumpster"}
{"text":"Hellloooooo is anybody there?  Two out of the past three times I've tried to stop here it's been closed. The first time there was a note on the door that said closed due to illness and the second time there was nothing except locked doors during business hours.   The only times I stop here are usually for some drunken slices and pop glory because they have a deal for it. They're one of the few cheap food options open late in Kamm's and definitely one of the few pizza by the slice places in Cleveland.   West Side Slices used to be the light at the end of the tunnel for me but I've really watched it go downhill these past couple months. Aside from being spontaneously closed they always tend to be out of pizza- I'm talking plain cheese and pepperoni slices here. Wut. How? They've actually turned away one of my friends because they didn't have any slices prepared and didn't want to make more (wasn't even within an hour of closing). The last time I was here the kid working told me they couldn't top a slice with banana peppers because it \"wouldn't work\" and I have no idea what that means. I told him he didn't have to bake them in he could just give them to me on the side and he looked at me like an alien then put them on top for me anyway. Pretty sure he hated me because that was the worst slice of pizza I've had in years and they usually have pretty decent pizza.   Please bring back whatever you used to be doing so I can adjust this review. I would hate to see West Park Slices close but I know that it used to be much better than it is currently."}
{"text":"West Side Slices is some of the best pizza around. I've eaten here a half dozen times in the past couple of months and the food has been consistently great. I order the calzone most often; they make house made dough daily and then pack it full of ingredients. A \"regular\" size calzone is two \"reasonable\" meals (especially from a calorie standpoint!)   They also sell canned pop for cheap at only $0.85/can instead of the standard $2.99 fountain drink.  The building and interior isn't the nicest atmosphere, but I don't really care - what I'm looking for is good pie... I recommend you check it out!  There are also 3 Pok√©Stop that you can hit from the dining area... and another half dozen within a 5 minute walk."}
{"text":"This place opened up last summer and I love it! Both their \"traditional\" pizza and their large array of unique specialty pizzas are great. They're not shy with their toppings and the flavored crusts are delicious! One of the best things about this place is the large and diverse menu. I always have a hard time picking out what to order because there are so many great options! I also think that the prices are very, very reasonable for the amount of food that you receive. I've never been hungry after enjoying their food! I am glad that they're in my neighborhood."}
