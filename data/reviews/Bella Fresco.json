{"text":"This place has a serious problem with unwelcoming and rude servers. We have been back a few times because the food is pretty good but each time the servers are always rude and not friendly at all! And the service is slow because they hangout in the back behind counter and talk."}
{"text":"Such great food and such a great price!!! This little gem is well worth a try. Whether you are getting lunch, dinner, desert or drinks, this is a solid choice. 

The gelato is phenomenal. The owner is here most nights to come out and talk passionately about his love for his food and how he learned about the ingredients and processes to make his food the best.

The beer selection is solid, for you drinkers: they have Bell's seasonal in bottle and on Fridays and Saturdays they're $3!"}
{"text":"This place is a disaster.  For the second time, I've ordered a salad to go that is not the same when you get it as it is described in the menu.  Kale Ceasar Salad says it is kale and romaine - no romaine to be found, no croutons, and I had to wait 25 minutes.  This place is in the building where I work, the people are nice but they can't run a restaurant.  Done, no more, no coming back."}
{"text":"Bella Fresco was amazing!!!! Beautiful restaraunt, amazing service!!! It was such a great experience! Wine was great, the appetizer was delicious- we got the blooming onion and then I ordered a craft burger, the mamasita! Then for dessert, we ordered gelato! This place offered a great vibe, with awesome music and service, and most importantly, the food is so fresh and yummy! Definitely visit this place sometime!!"}
{"text":"I guess I should have known when the description said they serve three types of cuisine....Italian, Mediterranean and Hawaiian, hard enough to excel at one, they're trying all three.....anyway had a pizza, nothing special, run of the mill pizza....
Somebody had a burger, same thing, frozen patties, run of the mill.....
Somebody had a chicken skewer plate with Potatoes that were super over seasoned, chicken was ok....
Then we got the gelato (seems like their claim to fame),  and even that was nothing special....
Anyway, somewhat edible, but definitely a one and out visit."}
{"text":"While I was walking to my office yesterday, someone handed me a card for this place.  I put it in my pocket and forgot about it, but my co-worker got a lamb burger for lunch and it looked and smelled great, so I decided to give it a try myself and I'm glad I did.  The meat was perfectly cooked and juicy and tasted great, the goat cheese went really well with both the meat and the bacon-onion jam.  The only thing I would do differently is ask for them to go light on the bacon-onion jam the next time, as it was a little too sweet for my taste.  Anyways, it was so good that another of my co-workers ended up getting a lamb burger.

Then, today, two of my co-workers and I called in a lunch order.  One of my colleagues who lives near the Arboretum location recommended the steak sandwich, so I got it.  It was good also, although I preferred the lamb burger.  

That said, the service was a little disorganized so I can definitely believe the negative reviews on here.  My colleague who ordered a lamb burger today got a pickle with his, although I did not yesterday.  He also got sweet potato fries instead of the herb-roasted potatoes that he ordered.  All the lamb burgers that were ordered arrived in different packages.  It wasn't a big deal for any of us and we all agreed that we'd be willing to go back and at full price (we'd gotten a 30% discount that's good through the rest of February), but I could see how it might have led to a long wait or terrible experience for a table-service meal.

I'm starting a new job next week so I won't be back for lunch, but hopefully they'll fix the inconsistency/disorganized service.  If they do, I'd be happy to give them a try for dinner, and if they open a location near South Park, I'd definitely give them a try for lunch"}
{"text":"***update please everyone look at the pictures I just posted showing that I got harassed after posting my review by the owner. This guy is a piece of work. No one should have to worry about making a review on yelp and then have someone from the place contact them and harass them because of their review****

Went in to have some lunch and should have went somewhere else. Food was ok and service was ok. There was nothing about it that would make me go back to it so if you are looking for a place to have lunch with really good food this is not it."}
{"text":"I usually don't write reviews but something has to change for this restaurant. I went in last week around 12:45 to order a panini, something that you wouldnt think would take very long to make and a side of fries ($1.50 extra). I sat and waited an hour while everyone else in front of me got their food and walked out. When I finally got my food by the time my lunch hour was over, I was not given the fries that I paid extra for. The panini itself was decent. The management I could see felt bad and wrote me a card for one free lunch item. I went back down today to use my gift card for a free lunch Item hoping for a better experience only to get a cold plate of fries and a cold wrap and my side of ceasar dressing? was incredibly seperated and nasty. I TRULY want this restaurant to do well but you would think after a horrible experience and knowing I was comped a meal, that they would at least give me fresh food."}
{"text":"Ate here several times. Panini's and salads are so good. Always busy, food comes out fast. Great place."}
{"text":"I was disappointed by our most recent visit to Bella Fresco.

I've been a big fan of this restaurant for several months now.  Although the food was excellent last week I was completely dismayed by the response of the manager on duty about the pieces of what appeared to be small pieces off of a China plate that were mixed into my food.

I brought the problem to the attention of the waiter, whose reaction was also somewhat indifferent. Seeing his indifference I asked to see the manager. I was twice told that the manager said \"It will never happen again.\"  The waiter pointed to the manager who was seated in a booth nearby and said that if I wanted to speak with him I could walk over and do so. I said, \"No, given the circumstances the manager should be coming to speak with me.\" 

The manager had the waiter comp my meal, but that is not what I was looking for.  I did not go there for free food; I went there because I liked the variety of the menu and I respected and appreciated what the owners of this locally owned restaurant were doing. I still like the menu but I'm very disappointed in that manager's apparent indifference about foreign material on the plates.

I understand that things happen in kitchens that are not intended. But in this case it is the response of the management, or lack thereof, that is most notable and worthy of comment."}
{"text":"We've always been happy with our meals here. The staff, including the owner, are super friendly. The food is fresh, delicious, and very reasonably priced. I also like that the portions are perfectly sized. We come here often and always bring friends or family with us."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. I had the Philly with the works minus the pizza sauce with sweet potato fries! Sooo tasty! :) I was definitely happy with my choice. The gelato was okay, I had tiramisu and some other coffee flavored gelato which was much better than the tiramisu flavor. The service was good and the management team was really nice. They just started using Groupon and Yelp! deals and had never seen a yelp deal before so the payment process was interesting. Also, they have \"specials\" , that night my husband had their gyro special for $5 and NO GROUPON or YELP deal can be applied towards that special. So, in order for your groupon/yelp deal to apply, all purchases must be at full price. 

My last tip for future diners is to not go by the menu on the website because the menu at the restaurant is a little different. And...for Bella Fresco, keep up the tasty food, simplify your decor and make the restaurant a little more inviting, and the online ordering system needs some additional items.

I gave Bella Fresco 5 stars for great fast but not \"fast\" food and wonderful service. I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Bella Fresco.  My wife had been once before and convinced me to try something new.  I walked in with low expectations and was almost validated when I saw only two people dining on a Tuesday night.  Mind you it was pouring rain and not a night most people would venture out for dinner. 

After browsing the menu (which caters to both Greek and Italian cuisine) I ordered a cup of chicken tortilla soup and a Greek salad with chicken.  My wife ordered a pita wrap with chicken and fries.   She has gotten this item before and again was very impressed with the quality.  The soup was outstanding.  No need for any seasoning added.  It had a nice spice to it and was full of flavor.  

The Greek chicken salad was amazing.  I have gotten many over the years at various Greek restaurants but this one was up there with the best of them.  They serve theirs with banana peppers which is a nice touch.  

They also have a decent selection of bottled craft beer.  I had a Bells Oberon.  The service was fantastic.  Our server was attentive but not over bearing.  He really seemed to be invested in the company.  Near the end of dinner, he asked if we wanted any Gelato.  Bella Fresco claims they are Charlotte's only wholesale Gelato dealer.  He brought my wife and I a full sample tray.  Fantastic Gelato.  

My only criticism with Bella Fresco is the interior.  It doesn't have a great flow with seating and decor.  But when it comes to what matters, which is the food, Bella delivers!  There is another Greek restaurant next to Bella and suffice to say I will never return to it again.  I am sold on Bella Fresco and will spread the good word."}
{"text":"I had a mix of marscapone and chocolate crunch Jellato.  Both recommended by our server. Excellent."}
{"text":"Never actually had a chance to eat because we were seated and then ignored. After about 15 minutes we got up to leave without anyone even taking our drink order. As we were leaving 3 servers just stood there and stared at us. Keep in mind the place was only about half full... Will never go back. Very rude."}
{"text":"Great experience! !!!! The food was excellent and the best service!! Will most definitely be back! LeAnn was so helpful and very attentive."}
{"text":"It was wet outside which made the floors like an ice rink. Don't take your weak hipped grandmother here on a rainy day. It was a little confusing inside, but to be fair, \"confusing\" is a relative term for a restaurant. An IQ of 85 will lead you to the right counter eventually.  The food seemed fresh but tasted no more than OK.  If you're hungry, stop at McDonalds to pre-game with some McDoubles before going to Chez Slickfloor.  The biggest turnoff was how smokey it was inside from the grill.  My two year old was going apes*** over the smell of smoke.  We dried off some tables out back and threw half his sandwich to the ducks. All in all, great location, and a nice  patio once you finish the maze behind the counter.  I think they'll really struggle next winter. Too much going on inside and aside from the gelato, there's no stand out reason to try them out."}
{"text":"The food was great. I had the Greek lemon chicken over roasted potatoes, and it was amazing. My girlfriend had the gyro. Both were amazing. We also had dessert. Tiramisu and marscapone gelato were great too. I know I'm giving this place an overly positive review, but I rarely am so pleasantly surprised with restaurants that I want others to know about it. So do yourself a favor, and go check it out. There is nothing to lose, because it doesn't break the bank."}
{"text":"In one word - confusing.  Upon entering you are met with a welcome greeting but then you are on your own.  First area you see and pass is the gelateria which seems odd to be the first place your eyes and stomach go to.  We wandered past this area and then there is a wine display (sort of and more about that fiasco later) and we finally reached the salad/sandwich area with wait staff more than eager to help - after asking if it was our first time we were given the sandwich/salad/pizza instructions twice - but we did stop the second staff person mid sentence to say we were already informed.  I ordered a cobb salad - meh - hubby ordered club pannini  - it had some nondescript sauce on it that he didn't like or recognize.  

Problem was when we went to check out, we ordered a bottle of Pinot Noir wine and 2 glasses - person behind the register rang it up but the total was no where near what it should have been with two meals and a bottle.  We mentioned this and the owner (?) stated he was charging for the little bottles - since we had no idea what that meant we paid and sat down.  The waiter then brought 2 glasses of Pinot Grigio which I informed him was not what we wanted and showed him the bottle that I had previously named.  After realizing the mix-up he brought the bottle of red wine and two glasses.  Five minutes later, he returned to our table to tell us they had undercharged for the wine (duh!) and that we now have a current charge up at the register.  Hubby indicated we would square up after our meal which was okay with the help although it was just awkward and the entire experience seemed like no one know what they were doing but there sure were alot of them around.  Owners (?) have taken up residence right in front of the register at town tables - tables were strewn with computers, paperwork, wine bottles, etc.  Again, felt like we were intruding on their running of the restaurant with wait staff going over to ask questions, etc.  Would make more sense to have this area in back of house.  Nice deck off the back - huge plus but not sure enough to bring me back.  Will wait a month or town and retry to see if the kinks are gone or I am!"}
{"text":"just tried to place a delivery order and was told there is a $25 minimum - really?  interesting that such a bogus rule is stated nowhere either on this yelp page or on your website but was arbitrarily thrown at me AFTER i had already given my entire order to the person who answered the phone.  i ordered $15 of food and would have been happy to pay a delivery fee, not to mention generously tip the driver.  it is 20 degrees outside and i am home ill.  thanks for nothing - now rest assured that you will never get my business.  over what probably would have amounted to about a $6 deficit when all was said and done...unfortunate."}
{"text":"I've had dinner here twice and both times enjoyed it immensely. The food is wonderful and the price point is just right!  The hummus is very good, served with crispy pita chips and a few olives. We also ordered the Margarita pizza as an appetizer to share. I prefer a thinner crust but it was decent. We didn't get it on our second visit. The beer and wine selection is not vast but I think there's something for everyone. I ordered the lamb fajita with their lemon rice.  Instead of the Greek salad that comes with it, I ordered the pomegranate salad. My friend ordered the exact same thing. Let's just say, that meal was so good that when we brought our husbands the next weekend, we both ordered the exact same meal again! The lamb is sooooo good! We both agreed that the leftovers we had for lunch the next day were even better than they'd been the night before!

The service both times was adequate but not exceptional. They were friendly but we did have to ask for silverware one time and another time we waited so long for the waiter to come back that my husband went to the bar to order a beer. 

I like that the owner serves gelato, it's a nice chance to interact with him. The flavor are great, I especially liked the lemon basil.  

We discovered toward the end of our second visit that they have a really nice patio out back. I'm not sure why they don't mention it when they're seating you; it's like a secret back there. We'll be asking to sit there next time.  
We will be back, one of my new favorites!"}
{"text":"I have 3 tries here. 1st time they were just opening and so it was confused but my sandwich was ok. Second time was ok, but a little pricey for what it was. Third time, a to go order, was not packaged correctly and got Alfredo sauce all over everything except the pasta. Including the car. Really don't know how someone could pack a to go order so carelessly. 
Bottom line the food is OK, but this restaurant just doesn't make it past anything more than ordinary."}
{"text":"Menu is great.... Food was dialed in and half assed, some dishes were not even completed... Service was less than stellar and could be due to the incompetence of the kitchen. Pick your battles..."}
{"text":"We came here for my Daughter's birthday so our kids could have gelato - which is very good.  Really.  Service was certainly adequate and the waitress with whom we interacted was very sweet and responsive.  However, the pizza was terrible; actually my son's words were \"really yucky and tastes like a pizza that was made with goo.\"  Alright, so he's 5, but he's not that far off in his description.  The crust was crisp, but not special at all.  We really didn't like the sauce or the cheese at all and the pizza had a strange odor that didn't exude that of a fresh pie, but rather old cheese.  While I consider myself a pizza enthusiast, I don't think I'm a snob, but there are much better pizza places in the South Charlotte area for sure - and my son (again age 5) said he wished we had just ordered Papa John's.  (Which would have been way cheaper too)"}
{"text":"Had a hankering for Italian today and decided to pop into Bella Fresco...I was starving so I needed something quick and relatively inexpensive.  I was greeted by Tanner and realized it was not a quick serve restaurant.  I didn't want to sit around & have a long meal as its only me and I wasn't going to be spending much.  Tanner said \"it's all good...I'll seat you in my section\". 

Then I wanted to know if the food would arrive quickly because I was starving!  He reassured me that the food would arrive quickly and it did! The eggplant parm was delicious!

All in all, a great experience due to the service that Tanner provided!  I was so impressed by his genuineness."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a fabulous lunch at Bella Fresco. Had the avocado chicken pita wrap with homemade chips. Everything was fabulous and the service was great. The best part was when our server surprised our group with gelato samples. I can see why it's award-winning gelato!"}
{"text":"Gelato, was great, almin the waiter was excellent, how ever the food was extremely dry and Might be old as well, the egg plant Parmesan was really dark, my father had chicken Parmesan was dry as well, The Gyro plate that I ordered was extremely dry and just a few pieces, and the portion was really small I asked for a side salad came with no dressing, fries was very ok, I don't believe in returning my food or ask for my money back, but I do believe in supporting small businesses, I hope they concentrate on the quality of food, the two star does not or is not for the gelato or the service but it's for the food quality"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here twice for lunch and twice for dinner. I'm just not impressed. Food is okay. Service is okay. Gelato is really good. Casual place, okay prices. Sorry I can't say much else!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and great price.  The Paninis and wraps were great!  Also you have to try the gelato before you go.  Will return regularly."}
{"text":"First time at Bella's. Great experience with the family.  Well prepared food and great service.
Definitely will be going back."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick business lunch--nothing too heavy on a hot day. We were greeted warmly and quickly and I immediately noticed how clean the place looked even though it was towards the end of lunch hour. 

I had a delicious Greek salad with gyro meat --generous portions and they perfectly executed my request for no onions and dressing on the side. 

My lunch partner had a wrap and fries. The fries are awesome!!

Clean, friendly and the food came out FAST!

A great find in a restaurant filled neighborhood.

Oh--and we weren't interested in the gelato but it's made in house and looked amazing."}
{"text":"My wife and I have eaten here 3-4 times now. There food is good, but the Gelato is the best I have had!  My wife had a salad last time and she said it was amazing. I ordered a hamburger which was just Ok. Seemed like a frozen Patty, but that's what I get for ordering that there. The Cajun wrap I got the time before was great. I do love there homemade chips."}
{"text":"I don't get all the bad reviews. We came on a Friday night. The food was really good. We had a variety of dishes, flat bread, pasta, lamb & salmon - all delicious! 

I've read the service is bad, but our sever was attentive. He did bother us, but was sure to check in on us regularly.  The 4 tables around us seemed satisfied as well. 

I think everyone should give this place a try. The Pepino Fresco cocktail and Blueberry crumble dessert OMG!!!!"}
{"text":"So I went to this restaurant April 7, 2017 and truly had a unpleasant experience; the food came out really quick, but it was extremely disappointing. I ordered the chicken and shrimp with yellow rice. The food was cold and taste like pine soul; after two bites, I was over the whole meal. The sad thing was after nine years in the Marines I never thought i would deny a dish of food, but this was worse then Parris Island. To top it off the waitress came up and I explained to her that I didn't like the food; shortly after a few minutes someone came from the back saying that I ate half of the food and would still have pay for the for the full dish. I never expressed a problem with paying for the food, but I was not going to eat the dish. After it was all said and done; the part that took me to a hundred was the person assuming I didn't want to pay, and the fact that I ate half the dish when I only took to bites. They need to hire better cooks and stop serving old food...I will  not return; not even for free."}
{"text":"The food was not very good, the pizza looked and tasted frozen, although the service was quite nice but definitely need more waitors/waitresses."}
{"text":"I love the open space of this place because it doesn't feel too crowded. I ordered one of panini's and half salad. Panini is okay, nothing to rave about but I had my salad topped with gyro and it was delicious. My boyfriend and I decided to grab some gelato after our finishing off our lunch and the owner (I'm just assuming) was the absolute sweetest. We were standing in front of the gelato display deciding on what he wanted and the owner came up and offered us samples and he basically gave us a sample of all of the flavors and they were all so yummy. If you're a coffee ice cream lover, definitely go from the chocolate chip expresso gelato because they definitely did not skip out on the expresso. Overall I had a great first experience here."}
{"text":"We held a private party for 60 people here on Labor Day weekend. Elliott did a wonderful job with the menu, which included a baked pasta, crab stuffed mushrooms, flat breads, meatballs, chicken parm sliders, etc.  The food was awesome, and portions were huge.  We could not have been more pleased.  Our gathering was a welcome party before a wedding.  The space was open enough to have people mingle, Yet intimate enough for small clusters to gather."}
{"text":"I ordered their veggies-extravaganza panini, and swapped out the side of kettle chips that came with it for the cucumber-mint salad for an extra $1.99. Both were very good and I will def order them again!  Likewise, they have plenty of other dishes to serve my diet needs, and even their unsweetened tea was good. Most restaurant unsweetened tea tastes like colored water, but their's actually had flavor to it, and I definitely do NOT add sugar or sweeteners to my unsweetened tea.  
My waiter, Christopher, was very attentive so therefore, their service score is very high in my book."}
{"text":"I have had great food there and have no complaints there.   It would be 5 stars.   Their website has and order here.    It says it has delivery.    I placed an order, paying 3 for gas.   45 minutes later I call.   My order is waiting for pickup?    They don't deliver, I should call foodie?   They'll come and pick up my now cold food and get it here.   OK give me a refund, nope can't do that.   They don't know how they don't handle the order.  Told me to call my bank and cancel?   Eventually if I call back in 4 days, the owner can help me with that refund.   No food, and I am out money.   They do get any stars because their food is great and their instore service is excellent.   But website and menu specifically says \"we cater and deliver\" and the order now on the website even takes your money and charges you for gas..."}
{"text":"I had not heard of Bella Fresco Cafe, even though I have been to several other restaurants in that same shopping center, until I saw a coupon for it on Living Social.  So we decided to check it out on a Friday night a week ago and it was not crowded, we were immediately seated.

After looking at the menu, I went with the Steak Panini and Kevin went with the Abuelo.  The Steak Panini with lamb was very tasty, loved the meat in that along with the onion and peppers.  My only complaint is the cheese, they had american cheese with it and it just tastes cheap with that kind of cheese.  Come on, you can get a nicer sliced cheese to put in that panini!!  Kevin's sandwich was much better than mine, it had a lot of flavor with the mozzarella sauce and pico de gallo.  I would get that one the next time.  My other complaint is the sides.  The sandwiches come with house made chips, but they are not good and over cooked.  You can choose another side, sure, but that is an additional charge.  Kevin did get the fries and they weren't anything worth the extra charge.  Maybe will try a different side next time, but so far the sides are not good.

Of course, afterwords we had some gelato and it was fabulous!  They had no problems giving us samples of each one until we found the one we loved, great customer service.  Will look forward to going back for that this summer.

My overall thought is this is a 3.5, yes we will be back, but it won't be our first thought or we probably will not have a frequent return visit."}
{"text":"This place charged us twice. Once and then again an hour and a half later. They did say they would resolve this when I called them, but it's been two days and still no refund. The server was nice, but he was the one who charged us twice. 

The overall food experience was not a good one! 

Pasta Dishes..
*The Puttanesca- my friend said this was worse than any frozen meal she's had. It was also served cold!

*Tagliatelle in an Alfredo sauce - the sauce was good.  They messed up the order and had to make it over.  When the other order came, it was over cooked. I've had plenty of fresh homemade pasta to know when it's over cooked!! 

Since the puttanesca was so horrible, they made a margarita flatbread for my friend. This was edible, but not very good. The bread itself was decent but the sauce was really bad."}
{"text":"Servers brought out our food and were not sure of the names of the entrees, peoples food got mixed up and some food came out that was not ours.  The food was great but service was very slow and servers were confused."}
{"text":"Went for a Sunday brunch while visiting. Oh my goodness, the food and service were incredible!! Marquita was attentive and friendly, the perfect mix! The lamb burger was amazing, the fries so good I forgot to add ketchup... We had to taste each other's entrees... The chicken and waffles SO tasty, and the creme brulee French toast was light and fluffy and scrumptious. We planned on gelato, had even sampled a few flavors before our meal, but were so satisfied we decided to come back another time for that. Also, prices were excellent!"}
{"text":"Server was excellent however the kitchen could not get anything right. The mussels in my dish were served in an unopened state.  I've never seen such a thing. The one I did pry open tasted like paper.  Does that mean they were not alive when cooked.  I ordered a salad without onions and got heaps of onions in it.  Needless to say I won't go back."}
{"text":"Delicious food and friendly service in the arboretum! From the lamb pizza to the pomegranate salad, I kept being amazed by the tastes of this hidden little restaurant. 
   Driving by I stopped for lunch & tried the half and half special--recommended by the wonderful server Leanne. You can choose half pizza/salad or half salad/panini combo and it was a generous portion, exactly what I wanted. The lamb pizza had tomatoes & feta with nice bite size lamb on a fresh thin dough. The pomegranate salad Leanne recommended & they substituted feta for the regular blue cheese. It had yummy strawberries & nuts & feta with a balsamic dressing.  They have gyros & paninis I will return to taste! Truly fantastic service & food! I always look for a quality meal in South Charlotte area & this is my new favorite!"}
{"text":"Great visit!
Sat out on the back patio...gotta ask for it or you wouldn't know. Couple ants but your outside!!!
Service was on point even though out there.
Had bruschetta app...tons of tomatoes, not too crunchy bread yum.
Mixed fajitas (shrimp, lamb, chicken) very tasty, cooked perfect. Warm soft pita bread. Salad was terrific and the dressing homemade.
Gyro was so big and cooked so perfectly. Great fries. 
Lamb rice tasted like risotto with tender lamb.
Food was excellent!!
Baklava was great and a huge piece. Gelato was smooth and so good.
Will come back !!"}
{"text":"We've been to Bella Fresco twice now (in about a month's time).  It's tucked back in the corner of the Arboretum shopping center.  The first time, we sat outside on their secret back patio (it's not actually \"secret,\" but we had no idea it was back there!).  It's situated on a deck patio with lights all around, and it's pretty quiet back there amongst the trees and water, unless there's a loud group nearby.  The menu is pretty extensive and has a variety of options (I love variety!) so there's surely something that will appeal to everyone in your party.  

The first time, I ordered the Cobb salad with chicken shawarma.  Where else can you find that?  It was delicious, flavorful, and fresh.  The second time, we went back to try their calzones. They were very big and good, too.  We look forward to returning and trying one of their many other options: pita wraps, philly cheesesteaks, Italian entrees, burgers, etc.  There's so much to choose from.  I just noticed they serve breakfast, too, so that's something we'll have to try as well.  And I haven't even talked about the fresh Italian gelato that they serve.  We've always been too full to have any after our meals, so I think we'll just have to stop by sometime for take-out!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here yesterday! My mom was with me and we had amazing food! I ordered the lemon garlic chicken with roasted potatoes and mom got the calamari. Both dishes were awesome! I got a cappuccino and a small marscapone gelato afterwards. Those were awesome as well! I will say that the restaurant wasn't too busy, and my mom kept getting frustrated when she needed her wine glass filled. That's not going to stop us from coming back!"}
{"text":"Cool place, good food and fun owner. What else can I say? The menu is a great mix for everyone and plenty of lamb dishes! Sam has been our waiter twice and as really taken care of us. The price is so right too! Go dressed up or go casual it doesnt matter. There is a sweet patio in the back... do it."}
{"text":"Have been here for brunch 3 times and have had a great experience each time. One of the few places in Charlotte that does bottomless brunch and they keep the drinks flowing with attentive service. The food is good, but they could use a little more of a selection."}
{"text":"Wow! I went in with not high expectations, but was extremely please with my visit; I had the falafel and the gyro, everything was delicious;
Lee Ann, was a great server and made my lunch very enjoyable. No more showmars for this guy! Found my new favorite place for lunch"}
{"text":"You can find countless reviews on their gelato and so many are spot on about how wonderful it is!  However, there are few reviews on the food itself and the wonderful staff.  Every time I have been in, I've been greeted like part of the family and I love it!  The staff is more than just polite and friendly, but warm, welcoming, and full of personality. It only gets better from there.  The food is fantastic; from the spinach  artichoke dip, to the best mac and cheese pizza I have ever had.  If you are a soup person, who likes it thick and flavorful, Executive Chef Tas has you covered with his broccoli and cheese!  The desserts are, of course, fabulous.  Along with the marvelous marscapone gelato, the tiramisu is light and absolutely heavenly!   Now, I just can't wait to try the breakfast. I saw the picture of the Belgan waffle covered in gelato and strawberries and I have to go back for it!"}
{"text":"Spinach Artichoke pizza is amazing! Great service, great food and great selection on the menu. I am looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"Clearly I am the odd ball who wasn't particularly impressed with this place. We read the reviews and thought we would give it a try. Sadly I did not know about the Groupon deal. Had I known about that,  it would have at least lessen the blow from the final amount of the check.. We were seated and our drink order was being taken before we all sat down. The menu was OK nothing that blew my socks off. I guess the name of the place led me to believe this was an Italian restaurant but there was mostly Greek dishes on the menu AND the Italian sandwich came with MAYO. NO NO NO NO NO!!!!!!!!! Never and I mean NEVER do Italians put mayo on an Italian sandwich. Seriously what is with these places and their obsession with putting mayo on EVERYTHING especially Italian hoagies.  I had the Lemon and Oregano chicken on a Mint Salad. My chicken was 1/2 a breast that was probably sliced in half, grilled with no taste of lemon or oregano. The Mint salad was large chunks of cucumber, tiny diced un ripened  tomatoes, a handful of olives and a few ribbons of mint. My side item, the mac and cheese was delish and the highlight of my plate. My children had the burgers .One ordered a Cheeseburger and the other ordered a Build Your Own.  the server asked how they would like the burgers cooked. Both requested Medium. When they arrived it was obvious  they were frozen pattys, super thin and charred. They didn't have a shot at  being prepared Medium. They were so thin, the moment they hit the grill they were overdone.  My daughters cheeseburger came with nothing on it but cheese. Really? No lettuce? No tomato? I guess she should have ordered the \"Build Your Own\" and my son's burger was missing two of the 5  items he requested. My Hubby had a chicken dish on a bed of rice with herb roasted potatoes. His was the best looking and tasting dish out of the four. After Dinner we indulged in the Gelato. It was very good but a little pricey. 3 mediums and 1 small came to $21. The pistachio, strawberry Greek, nutella and the cannoli cream were very good. The birthday cake, which shouldn't even be a flavor to begin with, was overly sweet.  When it was all said and done we paid about $80ish for the entire meal. A little to pricey for what you got."}
{"text":"***Gelato Review Only***

I'd bookmarked this place not to long after it opened but hadn't had a chance to make it in until today. 

I was greeted  when I walked in, and asked if I was dining or just getting gelato...and I smiled and said \"gelato only please\"! He laughed pointed me in the direction of the gelato counter. A quick walk over to the counter and I was greeted again by a super friendly man who asked if I wanted a sample. I started with the sorbet, and then no kidding....he gave me a sample of everything in the case!!!! My goodness.

When I was thoroughly confused because each one tasted better than the last I finally settled on the Vanilla Turtle. It was ridiculously good! 

I highly recommend a visit. I know I'm certainly looking forward to making this place a regular sweet treat for the Summer."}
{"text":"Don't miss this place!
This was our second visit and it was as good as the first. Tonight I had the name your own cheeseburger. It was cooked just right and was very tasty. But even better were the fries. Not sure what they coat them with but oh boy how good they are. The waitress (Vicky) was very friendly and went out of her way to be nice to our two young grand sons. Oh yeah grandson #1 is a burger expert and rated his the best ever! On the way out we struck up a conversation with the owner who went out of his way to show us his new patio in back. Nice touch. The grand finale is the gelato. Don't miss it. Huge selection!"}
{"text":"Came here with my bestie for Queens Feast weekend. Small space. Attempt at being trendy. Rather limited menu and not many descriptions. So asked our server... She had no clue from the wine list to the sauce the pasta is served in to the flavors of trio of sorbet they offered. The food was just ok; however, I really liked the Brussel sprouts. While we were sitting there 2 other tables were seated and they left before ordering. I was very displeased with the service and lack of knowledge of our server.
Spoke with the manager about our concerns. ..He just said she's relatively new. He never came back to check on us. ****thumbs down****"}
{"text":"Tonight's dinner 4/29/16 with friends was unfortunately the last we'll spend at Bella Fresco. Service was extraordinarily slow, even for salads. Meals took a while to be delivered. 2 friends had comp tickets from the restaurant's owner for 2 free meals based on the previous time's bad food. Tonight's on-duty manager refused to honor them even though the comps were signed by the owner and shown to him. The restaurant business in Charlotte is highly competitive and every customer is valuable - especially repeat customers. Tonight was the last straw and no amounts of comps will get us back. Arrivaderci."}
{"text":"Brunch was fabulous! Aaron was very attentive, friendly and helpful when deciding on the menu.  The chicken and waffles was delicious! The tenders were seasoned perfectly and the waffle was moist yet crunchy with just the perfect amount of syrup.  Add bottomless bellini and great friends, and you're guaranteed a great time!!"}
{"text":"This was our first time going to this restaurant and we loved it! Eggplant parm was really good and my husband loved the Cajun chicken panini. Gelato was amazing!!"}
{"text":"Loved the food, the service, the price, the gelato, the outdoor deck, and the availability of beer/wine. We plan to be back!"}
{"text":"I am basing my 5 stars strictly on my experience in coming here just for dessert.  We had just grabbed a quick bite to eat at Akropolis and decided to wander down to check out what had taken the spaces vacated by CoffeeWorks and Ben & Jerry's.  I was excited to find out that it was a Gelateria.  And yes, they make their own here and tonight had at least 20 flavors on hand. 

Of course, all of the flavors looked delicious and I must have tried at least 10 of them before I settled on the Mascarpone.  It was flavorful, rich and creamy - just as it should be! 

After we ordered our gelato, the owner also encouraged us to try a sample of their ice cream.  It was good, but I was more excited about the gelato since there aren't any other gelaterias in the area.  

While we were there, we checked out their menu and they have a pretty good selection of salads, pitas, sandwiches, etc. at reasonable prices. 

The place is open, clean, and welcoming.  The owner and employees that we encountered were very friendly and helpful.  I look forward to going back to try more of their menu offerings."}
{"text":"Delicious!!! My husband and I went here for lunch. We ordered the gyro and the Mexican Wrap. Both were fabulous. Finished off the meal with their award winning gelato and I must say, it did not disappoint. Their patio was beautiful- definitely not something you would expect to see in the arboretum. Very quiet and private with a nice view of the pond. Safe to say we will be back soon!"}
{"text":"The half and half deal with the panini and pizza is the way to go. The wait staff is always friendly and efficient. This restaurant is consistently a good value. I'll definitely be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Food was delish, dining absolutely delightful. We were on the waiting list for another restaurant nearby and got tired of waiting. Walked down and discovered this place. We dined on the back patio. So nice!! Food was great. We all loved it, even kids! Great wine and dessert list too."}
{"text":"Had a great brunch here today. The owner came and personally introduced himself. You can tell that he is very passionate about cooking and creating a welcoming atmosphere. My family and I absolutely love the Gelato selection. Everything was very fresh and packed with flavor. Try this place and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure at first, I'd seen the advertisement but never been. The food was A1! I had the salmon and quinoa for brunch...the flavor a were greeeeeatt!!! I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant and our dinner was delicious. LeAnn helped explain the menu and was helpful and attentive. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Service is amazing . The staff is super nice and friendly. The food is great and good quality. Their gelato is awesome . I really enjoyed their cappuccino and cannoli - definitely made a great combination !"}
{"text":"Solid 4-stars outing with family burning a $40 Groupon.  Our server, Marquita attended professionally  to our needs, pointing to key selections on the menu while navigating the whims of a 4 year old.  Plus, she kept the water glasses full.

Lori and I both ordered the lamb burgers on a brioche bun.  It's not a pick-it-up-and-open-wide entrée with an over easy egg and massive 8 ounces of juicy goodness dripping all over the place.   Fork and knife handled it quite fine.  It was delicious.  My son-in-law and daughter each ordered the smoked short rib benedict.  Another home run and a unique idea for brunch.

A couple things diminished their score, e.g. the music was loud and the bathrooms weren't well cleaned, nor the fingerprints cleaned off the front door.  It appeared they did a quick once-over and opened.  Secondly, they have a wonderful gelato bar which seemed under-utilized.  A small tasting at our table would surely have guaranteed an order for dessert, especially since the girls were gulping bottomless mimosas!  Fun day and a nice addition to the Uptown restaurant scene."}
{"text":"There was a point where my family was going here every weekend.  The food is good.  They are very family friendly.  There is gelato.  The pack patio is shockingly nice considering it's in the arboretum.  I was shocked at how good the pizza is.  My only suggestion is a switch from pepsi to coke products :-)"}
{"text":"We came here Saturday night for dinner ahead of the Boys II Men concert.  It was girls night out and there were 7 of us.  Considering the chaos uptown with the St. Patty's day bar crawl, it was a nice retreat to not have those crowds in this place.  The food was delicious and the prices were reasonable.  A few girls got the flatbreads, a few got entrees (lasagna, mediterranean chicken, mushroom risotto), and a few girls got tappas.   Everyone was extremely pleased with the food.  The downside to this place was the bar service.  Drinks took FOREVER.  The quickest delivery was for a glass of wine that one of the girls ordered.  Even beer took a long time to be delivered, but goodness the mixed drinks pretty much arrived with our meals.   I still gave this place 4 stars because the food was seriously that good, but I hope they can get it together with the bar."}
{"text":"I had the gyro pita with sweet potato fries ($2 up charge) for lunch and it was exactly what I wanted in a gyro. It had the right amount of sauce and veggies with lots of lamb. The service was superb as my server, Leanne, was attentive and friendly. This is a nice, casual restaurant with excellent dessert options that I'll be sure to try on my return."}
{"text":"Amazing service and food 
A true hidden gem the new manager is really making this place something special"}
{"text":"Delicious and creative! Wonderful service!! We'll be back!!! Eggplant parm was loaded with flavor. Kids eat free Monday through Thursday! They have wine and gelato!!!! Perfect place!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the most underrated restaurants in Charlotte. Their gelato is amazing, as are almost all of the entrees. My favorite is the Cubano panini. Great staff, kid friendly, great kids menu."}
{"text":"Deeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee-licious!  Bella Fresco has done a complete 180 in terms of service, ambiance and, most importantly, food in the two years since I last visited.

The dining room has been completely revamped since 2013.  On a Sunday night at 6:00, we were seated in a comfy booth.  Service was very attentive, friendly and helpful (including an inordinate amount of drink refills for 2 thirsty people).  

Though TV's aren't the main focus of the room, for an October visit, we were able to watch the Panthers pull one out against the Seahawks (YAHOOOOOOO!).  5 TV's (one giant, 4 pretty big) are along one corner of one wall and were all tuned to football (YAY!).  The TV's are not loud or intrusive and they don't give the space a bar feel, it was just nice to be able to enjoy the games during dinner.  This would also be nice for those who enjoy dining alone.

Onto the food - holy smokes, the food.  Someone had previously posted a photo of the Cubano panini.  Changed my life.  I have never had a cubano and I am sure this isn't authentic because it is served on a pita, but holy crap was it mouthwateringly good.  Tender, well flavored shredded pork with NO FAT pockets in it.  The ham, pickles, cheese, dijon mustard and mayo were perfectly executed and balanced.  I chose a side of mac and cheese, which was a $2 upcharge, but was well worth it.  Cheesy, with a bit of a garlic taste to it.  YUM!  My girlfriend ordered the veggie panini, which she said was delicious, and a side of fries which were crunchy and delicious.

To finish off the meal, we both got gelato.  Knowing how rich and creamy their gelato is, I got a small cup of the biscotti - YUM.  Girlfriend, who had eyes bigger than her stomach capacity got a large with chocolate, pistachio and (I think marscapone?).  She kept putting down the spoon, saying she was too full for anymore, but she worked hard and believed in herself and ate it all.  

Amazing meal (I cannot wait to go back and get another cubano, I may go tonight!), excellent service, nice space.  I will definitely be back to Bella Fresco ASAP!"}
{"text":"Very tasty food, had the shrimp pizza and greek salad (half & half) and cute restaurant.  Ordered for lunch pickup on yelp app and order was perfect and ready for me 15 minutes later. 
Prices are good."}
{"text":"I went to lunch on a Thursday afternoon at 12 p.m.   Bella Fresco is tucked in the Carillon Building - you really have to go looking for it, I don't think anyone would just willy-nilly find this place.  Which may explain why it was nearly empty.  There were a few people in the take-out area - which would be super convenient, if I worked in that building.  A server saw us standing awkwardly (and alone) in the front area and took us upstairs to be seated.  There were 2 other tables in an otherwise empty restaurant.   Not a big deal, but not a great sign.

Our server greeted us immediately and was very friendly.  My table ordered a couple of wraps with fries and a salad with salmon.  First, the fries - they were cooked perfectly.  Nice crispy outside - very tasty.  The wraps were also reportedly very good.  I ordered the fattoush salad with medium rare salmon.  The salmon was cooked exactly how I ordered.  There was a very salty seasoning on it that I didn't love, but it was okay.  If I were to do it over again, I would request no seasoning.  The salad was quite fresh and crisp, but the dressing was very bland - order a dressing you'll like on the side.  

The atmosphere was clean and sleek - but with almost no one there is just seemed a little weird.  I didn't love it.  I didn't hate it.  It was truly A-OK."}
{"text":"They have a good atmosphere and the Gelato is amazing but the lasagna did not have any flavor and we were charged $2.99 for 4 pieces of Yuca that wasn't worth the price."}
{"text":"A great place for a date night get away.   Very casual atmosphere and friendly and attentive wait staff.   Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"We had time for an extended lunch today and decided to try Bella Fresco Cafe courtesy of a coworkers Groupon. 

We started with a blooming onion, which was a big disappointment. Undercooked, with the center being a mess of raw onion and uncooked breading/sauce clumping together. 

Things got slightly better from here. The food was on, but nothing special. The panini I had ordered still felt slightly undercooked (cold) for my taste. But it was ok. 

The only reason I would go back is for dessert. Their gelato is made in house and is really good. That's also the reason why they get three stars instead of two from me."}
{"text":"The gelato is homemade and has incredible flavors with things like basil, rosemary, and all the fresh fruits you could want. Their food is consistently good and have a large diverse menu to make a crowd happy. One of the best places in Arboretum."}
{"text":"Very good place despite the other bad reviews. Food tastes great and is flavorful. Staff is also very friendly. Great and quite place for lunch. Tapas are very good."}
{"text":"Great patio overlooking the lake behind Arboretum shopping center.  Lots of ducks and geese to watch.  Went for lunch and ordered the chicken shawarma wrap.  It was delicious with the extra tzatziki sauce I ordered.  However, the cucumber salad was horrible.  It didn't seem fresh at all.  Had a weird herb flavoring too.  Service was prompt, but not super friendly.  I would go back and sit on the patio to give this place another try."}
{"text":"I got the shrimp scampi, a dish I enjoy at most other restaurants, and it was drier than cardboard or the Sahara Desert. The gelato and desserts are the only thing worth spending more than one cent on. The restaurant is huge for a place with no business, now it is no surprise why they have no business. You can find a better Italian place on any other street corner in Charlotte. I'd advise that you go to the Malaya Kitchen next door instead"}
{"text":"Seated quickly with fairly attentive service. Probably more like 3 1/2 stars since pizza was a bit overdone. Food tastes ok overall.  Open kitchen concept. Clean with nice selection of gelatos."}
{"text":"I'm new to this area! Yummm!!!! Cute lil cafe type of establishment w/a bar and menu of tapas, entrees & GELATO! Definitely casual, good for a chill quick bite to eat or sweet tooth stop. People very nice and they have tvs!! 
Samoa Gelato - yumm! Chicken Tika Marsala - yumm!"}
{"text":"Ordered humus for the appetizer and it was very good.  Asked for soft pita instead of the hard chips.  I ordered chicken parmigiana and it came with side of spaghetti.  The chicken was slightly warm and with no taste at all the spaghetti was hard and the sauce had the taste of a can.  I stopped eating and went back to the humus.  When the waitress came by she asked if I did not like the main course and I said no.  I told her I did not want it and asked for a box for my humus.  She brought my bill back and said that they had taken off 50% I paid it but told her to tell the manager I was not going to take my main course and I should not have had to pay for a meal I was not going to eat as I had taken only three bites just to make sure I was not missing the tasty area.  I will not return of course and I do not recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came by for dinner and drinks after work one day. We sat at the bar and had a great time! The staff was very nice and upfront about it being a fairly new business. Great food and atmosphere! We ordered a few tapas (chicken tiki masala & falafels) and had sangria (Wednesday's it's $5!)."}
{"text":"Great service. Best cannoli since my visit to NYC! Seriously!

Ample Greek Salad, really good mix of fresh veggies. 

Cobb Salad delicious. Both salads had big portions. 

Greeko Wrap with lamb was tasty & fresh. 

Ambiance is casual, with music playing and some sports on tv screens. Can be a bit noisy due to music. 

Great value for the price!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great atmosphere! My daughter loved her pasta and side of fresh fruit. I ordered the half panini and half pizza. So delicious! Fresh ingredients and full of flavor. Ask for Leanne as your server. She is awesome! Thank you Leanne!! I will be back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Bella Frisco for lunch today. Our first experience was exactly one year ago. We were attending a conference nearby and ate there for lunch. The lunch was crowded with people. The food was delicious and the service was great. We loved it so much we came back again the same day for dinner. We thought it was wonderful. Now fast forward one year. Today we again go for lunch. Our experience was totally different. Very few people were in the restaurant. The food was terrible and the service was mediocre. We ordered hummus as an appetizer. Rather than getting pita bread we got some type of chip that was very greasy and stale. The hummus lacked flavor. My wife ordered a schwarma chicken salad. It had no flavor. I ordered a Mexican loco wrap. The wrap was tough and over cooked and the filling was tasteless. At the end of the meal the waitress asked how we liked it. Unless the food is really bad I don't ever mention it. However in this case I thought perhaps they changed ownership since last year. I asked the question and the waitress and she said they changed managers within the last year. I explained to her her my feedback about the food. She left the table and the manager soon arrived. He asked why we thought everything was bad. I proceeded to give him my honest feedback. He had no interest in hearing our feedback and argued with me and defended everything. I realized right away he was not someone that wanted to hear any complaints. He told me he's never had anyone complain about all of the food and he couldn't understand why we were so dissatisfied. I realized he was not going to hear us so we dropped it. I have since looked at yelp and Google reviews. I see that I'm not the only one that had a problem with the service and the food. I do not recommend this restaurant. Don't waste your money or your time."}
{"text":"Wow!  First time at Bella Fresca.  The appetizer sampler for $9.99 was excellent.  My picky wife loved everything we ordered.  Spinach and Artichoke dip was great as was the falafel.  Highly recommend.  Amanda did a great job.  Ask for her by name."}
{"text":"As usual, great food, reasonable prices.  They accommodated our large group of 14 with ease....
Oh,  I almost forgot...  And this was most irritating...  They automatically add gratuity to the checks of 20%."}
{"text":"Just opened a week ago. Very friendly staff and nice atmosphere with a cute patio out front and a deck in back. Little lounge area inside. I had a taco salad which was pretty standard. The gelato was some of the best I've had in the U.S. and I'm a huge gelato snob. I asked and they do rotate flavors so will be back hoping for cantaloupe and will give another menu item a try."}
{"text":"Had the works cheese steak and it was fantastic. Chris was very pleasant and accommodating. Good selection of beer and wine also. Will be back again."}
{"text":"I've noticed this place for awhile now in the Aboretum.  For some reason I never ventured in until I read some yelp reviews.  If you are eating there, BE SURE  TO CHECK OUT THEIR NEW BACK DECK that overlooks the lake.  It's the best seat in the house by far.  The staff is super friendly.  They gave us A LOT of samples of the gelatos...OMG!  Don't try this stuff unless you want a new addiction.  We enjoyed Greek salads & paninis and look forward to going back to try more on the menu (pizzas, phillys, fajitas, gyros, burgers, etc) One last comment.  Can you really ever go wrong with a Greek owned restaurant?!  :)"}
{"text":"Ate here on a Saturday afternoon. Party for two. Pitcher of Sangria, two Greek salads...one with chicken, one with lamb. My chicken was delicious and my friends lamb was even better. The gelato in the freezer looks amazing as well but we passed on it. They have a great patio outback but we did not choose to go there because it was so hot today. Will be back for sure. Yum!"}
{"text":"The gelato is outstanding! I have tried many times and many flavors. They always encourage you to try different flavors before you place your order. 
There is a young girl who works there is a all-star employee. The owners are very lucky to have her working there.
We've tried the food occasions. I like the whole wheat pita that they make available.
The staff and owners are visible and friendly. Keeps gettimg better"}
{"text":"I was super surprised at how decent the food was for the price. Definitely take advantage of the hidden patio in the back. The gelato was decent."}
{"text":"Six of us decided to dine at Bella Fresco.  Our choice was a good one.  Our group had two pizzas, two paninis, one Greek chicken, and one angel hair pasta.  All of the selections were very good.  My pasta was excellent.  Service was very good."}
{"text":"This meal was absolutely incredible! One of my favorite restaurants in the area now!!! Can't say enough good things!"}
{"text":"Just came for coffee and desserts to celebrate.   Banana split, mango gelato, but one wanted the falafel instead. No one was disappointed.   Even the coffee tasted fresh. The falafel was goodin flavor but the consistency seemed off; bit too soft."}
{"text":"My dining mate had lunch here and enjoyed everything.
We were greeted by a very friendly waitress. The atmosphere, tables, booths, was  overall very comfortable.
The menu features Mediterranean and Italian food.
Pizza,  appetizers, wraps, salads, main entrees etc all reasonable prices with something for everyone.
We ordered the soup, home made tomato basil which was very tasty.
My dining mate ordered the chicken swarma  wrap with fries. I ordered a Cobb salad with shaved lamb.
Everything was tasty , plated nicely with good portion size. The lamb on my salad was one of the best lamb I have  ever eaten.
Alcoholic beverages also served.
The gelato showcase in the restaurant was amazing, with a display of over a dozen varieties all made on the premises. We would certainly return again.
I had read prior  negative reviews but we had a great experience with our visit."}
{"text":"Ok here we go, my wife and i ate here twice in less than 24 hours its that good. We got the groupon cause they had 1 available so why not use it and give the place a try.  Its only been open for 5 months and it is hard to find but well worth the trip to find. Its right in the same place as mortons steakhouse. We went for dinner sat at the bar, the bartender Aaron is awesome.  We started off with the beefsteak tomato and burrato cheese which was amazing. We split a flatbread that has bacon jam on it omg incredible. Then we had the shrimp scampi they offer a large and small portion which is great. The small portion has 6 very large shrimp which were cooked to perfection. The pasta noodles were home made and the scampi sauce was the best I've ever had. We were speaking with the owner and his father who are great and they mentioned their brunch menu so we looked at it and its small but perfect. So we woke up Sunday morning and said we r going for brunch, the peach balini was incredible. My wife had the bacon and cheese quiche which was the best quiche I've ever tasted and i dont like quiche so thats saying alot.  I had the short rib eggs benedict with a vegetable ragu. This is a must restaurant as i like to call it. YOU MUST HAVE DINNER HERE. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This new spot in the Arboretum has been open for about a month. We decided to stop by for some gelato after dinner this weekend. The gelato is made in-house and they had a great (large) selection of flavors. I had mint chocolate chip and my husband had the Nutella. Yummm!

They also have wine & beer and a pretty good selection of food - salads, pitas, burgers and even fondue. I will have to get back there for lunch one day!

The inside was really clean and bright - maybe too bright for the evening, but hopefully they can fix that so you'd actually want to hang out for a while. They also have a small patio with tables and on Sat night they had live music. 

A nice spot to check out after dinner or before your night cap!"}
{"text":"Dear Bella Fresca - I think we have a problem - you have so many delicious flavors of gelato I thought my head was going to explode. It's a good thing the \"molto amichevole\" attendant allowed me to put three flavors in my cup. Your Hazelnut - reminiscent of Frangelico, plenty of body and flavor. Your Baklava - wow - honey and walnuts dancing on my tongue. The piece de resistance was your Mascarpone - amazing and simply delicious - creamy and subtle. I am writing this letter from my hospital room because the Mascarpone did in fact make my head explode. No hard feelings, it was worth it. Once I receive my cranial transplant, I'll be back to try Pistachio and Salted Caramel..."}
{"text":"Went here during Charlotte Restaurant Week - braving the ice storm and Charlotte's inability to plow/salt/slag/brine roads. Immediately greeted and seated in the upper area of the restaurant. Nice decor. You could tell that they were working out staffing quirks but we had two awesome servers who were professional and personable. I had the prix fix menu with the pomegranate lamb, Pollo alla cacciatora and tiramisu.  My dining partner had the Chicken Tikka Masala, Salmon and tiramisu. No complaints on the food except possibly the lamb (only due to there being no essence of pomegranate anywhere). All were cooked to order, very flavorful and well plated. The portions were significantly larger than expected for a upscale dining venue in uptown."}
{"text":"Waiter challenges customer to a fight in the parking lot!

Once a week my buddies and I get together for lunch. We are all retired \"old men\" and we choose a different place every week. Today we chose Bella Fresco,in the Arboretum in Charlotte, NC. The place was fairly empty and the only person on staff was a fellow named Elliott who was the Host and waiter. We all had sandwiches and a beverage and unfortunately those of us that had a \"wrap\" found the sandwich to be poorly made. The tortilla was very dry and broke apart as you held it in your hand. We let it go, didn't make an issue over it and ate our lunch. When it came time to settle up, the waiter refused to honor our lunch coupons, saying \" if we always accepted coupons we wouldn't be in business\". He then proceeded to charge us a 20% gratuity on each bill. One of our members shorted his bill by $0.25 and when confronted by the waiter expressed frustration with the poor quality of the food and a 20% gratuity. The waiter Elliott became enraged, calling our friend an obscenity and then challenged him to a Fight in the parking lot saying \" I will kick your a-- old man so come on\". Needless to say we packed up our things and left but not before we decided as a group to never return here again and to tell everyone we know about this. The waiter threatened bodily harm to our friend over a quarter ?  Unbelievable."}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed with the food. Always fresh and delicious. My one complaint is every so often I'll get a waiter or waitress who does not want to serve. Tonight, though, my waitress was wonderful and I wish I could have tipped her more. I forget her name but she has a crescent moon tattoo on her chest. You're wonderful and did an excellent job. Thank you for being so patient with us."}
{"text":"I just had lunch here and the owner treated me so terrible I do not recommend anyone experiencing what just happened. I saw I had a 20% charge for gratuity on my bill. I never saw this ever and when I left I decided to ask the manager Elliot of why the 20% charge if the menus clearly says \"20% will be charged for parties over 6\" and I was just one person. He said that he did that because last time I did not tip! This was totally incorrect because I always tip everywhere I go and the last time I went was approx.. 2 months ago and he totally forgot he was the one who waited on me! I said that wasn't true and he then said \"well it must be your twin sister\". 
Totally unacceptable, unethical, an insult to customers and totally discriminatory towards me. 
I do not recommend going here because it clearly shows he is so concerned about his employees' tips which may be because he is taking a portion of it."}
{"text":"Loved the lasagna but portions were somewhat smaller than expected. Staff was kind and helpful with our wine selection. Will be back."}
{"text":"This was my first time going since it opened. I have had friends and family to and all say they have had an incredible experience. I ordered the beef lasagna and it was delicious. The best thing I can say about it was that it tasted like a home cooked meal. The wait staff was super friendly and helpful choosing an entree. I highly recommend it! Like others have said previously, the pricing is very reasonable!!"}
{"text":"Great quality; Service and food high marks; great family setting; has family restaurant/community feel. Plus gelato to top it all off-jwill be a regular spot for us!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and neither was enjoyable. The last time I went it was incredibly crowded (which I thought was a sign that it must be better). Took forever to get my food, service wasn't very good. Food is overpriced and lacking in flavor. Not worth your money."}
{"text":"Got take out pizza the other night.  Just Eh.  Honestly, for the price, dominos or Papa John's would have been better."}
{"text":"Never had a waiter (Eliot) ask a customer to step outside and fight because of no tip. Will never go to this place again. Never had this kind of experience before."}
{"text":"I had never heard of this place but bought a Living Social coupon after looking at the menu. 

I was greeted when I walked in and the staff was SO friendly. I placed a to go order and the manager (or maybe owner) offered us complimentary drinks while we waited. Then they let me sample several flavors of gelato. YUM!!! 

I had an omelette, tried the BBQ chicken pizza, and chicken/shrimp skewers. Very large portions and great quality of food. VERY pleased with the amazing service and great food. They have a nice, personal touch and make you feel like they really care. Definitely will return!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan. For anyone who lives or works near the Arboretum, you know how hard it is to find a place that is both fast and healthy. I have found Bella Fresco to be both, and to add to that, it is a great dining experience that includes table service, wine  list, and gelato for dessert. I'm sold. I've been a few times now, and on my most recent visit, I was pleased to see they have added a hostess stand and table service (except for the steady stream of gelato-seeking folk who can bypass the hostess stand and start tasting yummies). 

Food-wise, I love their salads. They are fresh, crispy and made with love. Exactly how I make my salads at home. They aren't overly-laden with cheese and other stuff. You pick your protein or leave it without. I also love their pita sandwiches. Yum. Freshly toasted pita with creative sandwich builds. My son has had the kids quesadilla and the kids cheese pizza, and was only \"ok\" with them because there was white and yellow cheese on them (he's super picky), but he did love the French fries and the gelato--of course!

I love to frequent locally-owned businesses, and will continue to visit Bella Fresca for healthy, unfussy food and the delicious gelato!"}
{"text":"Every time I go, there is something new, either on the menu or in the restaurant. The gelato is really excellent and fresh and different all the time. When it first opened, the menu was more limited. They got the pizza oven and the pizza was pretty good (worlds better, and cheaper than nearby portofinos). I went recently with the whole family just to get gelato. We were sitting on the back patio (which is serene and lovely except for the big black ants on the benches). The table next to us got pizza, and it smelled so good, we ordered one too (even though we were already eating dessert). It was way better than I had remembered it! 
If you tried Bella Fresco in the past and you were just so-so on the food, I encourage you to go back and try it again. I don't know if they have hired more help in the kitchen or if they are just getting into the swing of things, but it was pretty good before and now it is solid, reliable, while still offering something new to try every time. The menu is bigger, more varied, and has some more authentic Mediterranean fare. The pizza has really improved. The atmosphere is much improved too with seating on the front and back patio and new booths inside. It's great for coffee and dessert too."}
{"text":"The food is always good.  I really like the pizza here and the servers, especially Leanne are very friendly and helpful.  They also have good cappuccino!"}
{"text":"We visited at lunch and had several wraps including a Gyro, Swawarma, Cheese steak and cuban.  They were all very good.  All come with fresh made chips, also very good.  We also had a couple of sides of fries, but they were nothing special.

We also had some of the Gelato and it too was good.

We would eat here again."}
{"text":"I stopped by here to pick up something small for lunch. It was completely a random choice. And in so glad that I stumbled in here. The lamb pizza seemed pretty cool. I asked he waitress and she have it good reviews. 
It was amazing!! The pizza was topped with tomatoes, feta, olives and lamb. It was a good portion size especially for the price (6 bucks!) they didn't skimp on any of the toppings either. I would eat 1000 of those! It's safe to say that I will be going back here. And very soon!"}
{"text":"Service 100%!!! Handcrafted Cocktails 100%!!! Apps & Food 100%!!! Gelato 100%!!! It's a very convenient location in uptown and close to work so I'll be enjoying a few cocktails and appetizers at least twice a week!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch one day on a saturday. We got sat right away but waited a while for someone to go up to us. Probably waited about 5 mins. I saw a couple of workers standing by the gelato area talking. I made eye contact with a few of them and they were still talking. Finally a server went up to us and asked what we wanted to drink. We gave her our order and ordered the trio dip. I got the bella pizza and my fiance got a traditional sandwich. Dip was good. Pizza was ok and crispy. My fiance wasn't crazy about his sandwich. Service was slow and they weren't even that busy. There wasn't really anything memorable about it."}
{"text":"Greek salad was very good! The gelato was OUTSTANDING!! The back deck is awesome. Make a bee line to sit back there- very nice! The owner was very friendly and seemed to care about his customers!"}
{"text":"The gelato here is good, BUT the server was touching all of the gelato spoons with his hands. Literally rubbing each spoon with his fingers. I watched him do this with every customer (in between touching coins, cash and wiping up the counters).  For any of you who have worked in food service, that is a big No No!!!  You do not touch your customers' eating utensils with clean hands and especially not  dirty ones!!!!

The service is also slow and disorganized... Not to mention the fact that my server also handed my drink while holding the top of my cup with her fingers. 

The food was fine. It's the gelato that is worth stopping for, and I would be back if they followed better food service guidelines."}
{"text":"I stop by brought my date here for dinner. They were opened, the doors where wide open, we walked straight in. However, nobody was there? No HOST, no WAITERS, No WAITRESS, No WORKERS, there was NOBODY!!! Ruined MY DATE I had to leave & go somewhere else. Made me LOOK BAD!!! Don't ever Go Here. No one is even working in the front are OPEN?? Unprofessional, Disgusting, & Embarrassing. NEVER AGAIN!

This was exactly on March 16, 2016 the date was set for 8:30pm. This really one of the biggest disappointment I've had on a date. I eat at the Bella Fresco at the Arboretum Plaza all the time since I live in South Charlotte. Yet, I choose this location because it was neutral and closer for my date. Big mistake, these two companies are night and day probably different owners. I had confidence since I been to the other location I recommended to my date that we eat there. When I got there I was embarrassed no one was there no host, no waiter, no waitress, nobody. My date was freaking out like where are we? What kinda of place is this? Are they open? What is this? I was so frustrated I had calm her down and let her know I had another place we could eat. I understand that you might not be as busy as the other location. However if you are not busy shorten the hours & don't open everyday of the week. You are making your company look even worse by being open and having no customers or workers. Offer free appetizers, free drinks, online ads or something to generate business. That's the worse thing a company can do is be open and have no one in the front when guest walking to greet them. This is a very critical part of every business to have people to greet customers as they walk in. If no one is there they will walk out. If  can not afford to have workers in the front greeting people. Then shorten the hours or be closed that day. This is better than leaving a bad representation of the company like this. I recommend shortening the days open to Wed - Sat, actually hiring some people to work here, doing online Marketing, free appetizers, flyers to local businesses, to help generate more business. This saddens me how bad this location is considering how good the Arboretum location is but they are 2 totally different companies I see now. I hope this helps however I had probably the worse experience I believe I ever had coming to a restaurant for a date."}
{"text":"Excellent food, service, atmosphere and of course the best Gelato (on par with what we have had in Italy!) the owner Mosen, manager Juan, Mosen's son Elliott all absolutely wonderful!  The diverse menu makes it a place for all but don't pass on the gelato!  So many flavors and all out of this world, even sugar free gelato.  Be sure to taste them all!  Don't pass this place by! Live music is an added treat in the evenings on the weekend!  There is even outdoor seating in the back which is the best kept secret. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This was really bad, maybe the worst I've experienced in a really long time.
I ordered some delivery through one of those 3rd party services because I decided after a difficult week I deserved some lasagna. My companion ordered the chicken piccata, and together we got the spinach artichoke dip. Honestly, all of this food would have been 10x better coming from a chain restaurant like Red Robin. In fact, I wish we'd have gone there instead. And that pains me, because if there's an option to support a small business, that's the way I'll always go.

- The dip was awful. It was cold and congealed and completely tasteless. It wasn't so much a dip as it was a solid mass of stuff. It was totally inedible.
- The lasagna was disgusting. It was a heap of greasy ground meat with a pile of cheese. It was over-salted and reminded me of hospital food. Seriously, how can you get lasagna wrong?
- The chicken piccata was also quite interesting. The rice was pretty tasty; it was the lemon rice, I think. The chicken was tough. I mean, seriously tough, like, break out your steak knife tough. The meat itself was tasteless in the center, which implies it was just defrosted and cooked with some sauce dumped over it. Again, cafeteria food. There were mushrooms in the sauce, but they had dark spots all over them, i.e. the mushrooms you'd throw out at home because they no longer look fresh. 

The best part? Both of us have spent a good deal of time in Toilet Town since we ate the food. 

There was neither anything bella or anything fresco about this place."}
{"text":"Just had the most ridiculous encounter here.  Not only was my salad very small for the price but the server Elliott was confrontational. Asked to speak with the manager and he told me to leave.  I'll never go back!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here tonight for dinner for the first time. We loved the variety of items they have on the menu. Our food was delicious too! I got a Greek salad and pizza and he got a gyro. We highly recommend sitting on the back deck! 

The restaurant as a whole was very clean and the staff were very friendly and attentive. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I stopped in for the first time today and will defiantly be back. We were greated by a chipper smiling server named leighann who was extremely knowledgeable about the entire menu and helped us pick an outstanding selection. She recommended the lamb and swarma for my salad which I loved. My friend also loved the chicken pram she recommended. The restaurant was very clean and by what we observed for our 45 minute visit, leanne im sure is the reason behind it. She never stopped smiling or working. She recognized customers and they seem pleased to see that she would be serving them. I personally asked if she was looking for a different job BC the little bit I saw I wanted her for my company. The gelato was out of this world. She also showed us the beautiful back patio and stated we could bring our dog out there. She also gave us a to go menu with the daily specials which was appreciated.  I recommend this restaurant for gatherings or a solo experience. I also recommended you asking for leanne when you do. She will make sure your experience is top notch. That is if I can't steal her for my own company. The other server who also seemed professional and kept a smile as well. They noticeably work well together which is hard to find in a restaurant.  I was surprised to hear that our server wasnt the manager BC I can't see anyone else out doing her. Its not often that I remember servers but this one I wish could train a few of my managers. The bathrooms were clean and even the cooks smiled at us when we went to the restroom. The music selection I didn't think fit the restaurant but she said she was unable to change it so that would be one suggestion I have. And also bigger font on menu's. Its an extensive menu with a little bit for every desire.
I will be letting friends know about this place foresure and is where I will be visiting often.l always asking for leighann and if she's not there, Chris. She informed us that there is another location uptown that I will make a point to try as well."}
{"text":"In an area with countless dining choices to choose from, Bella Fresco delivered just what we were looking for- great food, friendly staff. My husband enjoyed his gyro, and my Hawaiian burger was really good as well. We finished the meal with a little limoncello gelato, one of numerous flavors to choose from."}
{"text":"I am sure that their food is fantastic but their customer service is horrible. We wanted to try this place because it was right across the street from my house and it was my mother's birthday. I walked in and this gentleman was mopping the floor. Instead of coming to the front to greet me, he stood with mop in and his hand and looked at me for a couple of seconds. He gave me that \" you are bothering me\" look. I asked him if he had a table for two? He replied, you can sit there I guess but I am mopping this section. Wow, what a way to welcome your customers, especially for the first time. I turned and walked out because I will not spend money at a restaurant that does not want me service. There are a ton of restaurants in the Arboretum that would be happy to take my money. I was really hoping to have a nice dinner to celebrate my mothers birthday but we ended celebrating with a restaurant that wanted our service and whom was pleasant."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch and were delighted! The service was very friendly and food was so good!  We started with a spinach artichoke dip which was good it had several large chunks of artichoke in it.  For our meal we had a chicken philly (pretty good) and the Mediterranean fajitas (great! Yum). The rice side with the fajitas was great and the Greek salad was good as well. The tiramisu was delicious as well! I would definitely recommend anyone in the area to try it!

**This was our first visit and I'm sure there will be more to come!"}
{"text":"The gelato bar is great but the food is mediocre at best. Wines by the glass were very over priced for this type of restaurant. We have been here in the past but will not return after this visit. 7pm on a Friday and the place was not busy at all, that is very telling."}
{"text":"Bella Fresco is having an identity crisis. The name sounds Italian, their cuisine is predominately Greek, and it doubles as a gelato bar. They are currently transitioning over to more of a sit down restaurant feel from an order at the counter system. It took few minutes for us to receive any service and when we did, it was all from the owner. There was only one server on duty and she was quite aloof to the owners signals for help. The food was ok but nothing to rave about. I am not sure if I will return."}
{"text":"I tried calling for take out, was on hold for 4mins, decided to called back & try again, placed on hold for another 2 mins. Decided to go call for take out elsewhere. I have been there before but I don't remember the food that much, but was willing to try again today, but not happening. Seriously, how hard is it to take 30 seconds to take a phone order??"}
{"text":"Ordered bruschetta - has a great balsamic glaze.  Gyro was fabulous with nice lamb chunks.  Tiramisu was to die for.  This is one of my new favorites."}
{"text":"Good food followed by great gelato!!! 

We loved the Veggie Extravaganza Panini and the fries were perfect. We tried the pistachio gelato and snickers gelato - it was hard to choose a favorite. 

The service was good too. Will be back for more yummy gelato!!!"}
{"text":"Very average food and overpriced appetizers. Service was very slow and MIA most of the time - we had to flag down other servers to get drinks refilled. To top it off, when we went to the counter to pay, their system was down so they were writing down people's credit card numbers to run after it came back up. (I'm not joking.) Needless to say, we paid in cash and have no plans to return."}
{"text":"We are here tonight for the first time and I was very impressed! They have a large dining area but the atmosphere was cozy and there was even live fault at music. 

My boyfriend got the Alfredo and I did the pick 2 with Mac n cheese pizza and the chicken turkey and pesto panini. I loved both of my dishes and he said his easily topped any chain Italian restaurant.

We finished off with a 4oz scoop of peppermint patty gelato which was amazing! They had a big gelato selection to choose from. 

The service was great and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent entrees,  service,  and gelato!  We were visiting daughter who lives in Matthews.   We like to support local businesses,  so after a mid-afternoon snack at a local brewery, we had dinner at this little gem.   The roasted red potatoes were unbelievably delicious.  Reasonable prices too! 

Chris, our server, was great.   He was patient as we studied the extensive menu,  very attentive without being intrusive throughout the meal,  and then offered suggestions for gelato choices.   There are so many flavors!   I love caramel,  and they had at least 3 caramel varieties.   He said the popcorn caramel was very good,  so I took his advice.   It was perfect!  Husband had the lemon,  and daughter had the peanut butter. 

If daughter doesn't move west,  we WILL be back!"}
{"text":"I got here 30 seconds before happy hour ended. Ordered the charcuterie and two other dishes. Super fantastic! The food had flavor and came out in a timely fashion. I asked for the wifi password and it was given to me(this is important because they don't have a guest wifi setup). 

I was surprised this spot was empty on a Tuesday after work. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is the definition of a hidden gem. I LOVED Bella Fresco.

You feel like family when you walk in this place. Everything from the color-changing backlighting on the sign to the people yelling out orders in Italian...reminds me of Italy. 

Anyways, we were seated promptly by the gelato area (to the lady's fortune and my wallet's misfotune) and given menus. I ended up ordering the Shawarma Wrap while the lady ordered the Vegetable Extravaganza panini. Both were very good! Great price for a weeknight dinner as well! 

The night ended with the lady going up to the gelato counter, and the guy manning it asked \"What would you like to try?\" and without skipping a beat, the lady answered \"Everything!\", to which he responded \"Everything it is\" and proceeded to give us small samples of his personal favorites.

Guys. This stuff is good. Real good. Fresh, homemade gelato, every bit as good as you get overseas. And pretty reasonably priced too, for that matter. 

Anyways, we had a great experience there and will definitely be returning. Bella Fresco has won us over as a great, convenient, and cheap meal."}
{"text":"Last night, I enjoyed dinner here with my neighbors. I was so delighted to try their food and it was so yummy!  One person in my party had dined here numerous times before and advised that we would sit outside; the other person and I thought she was referring to the cute little tables out front, but really she wasn't.  There is a really cute deck off the back of the restaurant surrounded by tall trees and lookout onto the SapHa Water Spring!  It is so serene and pretty back there.  The only suggestion that we would provide would be to add large fans, citronella candles to deter the flies, and clean the tables better/remove any particles of food due to the ants.  We really wanted to sit at the furthest table (closest to spring), but there were some food bits on the table and it was swarming with ants.  Also, our table had some crusted on bird poop.  Our hostess tried to remove it without any luck and we ended up putting the napkin holder on top of it.  Not a huge deal, but it would have made a small difference.

We ordered a pitcher of the sangria, which was nice.  They make theirs with red wine, diced apples, lemon slices and ice.  Everyone also had water, and I squeezed some lemon in mine.  For a shared appetizer, we had the bruschetta, which was AWESOME!  I was such a fan of the bruschetta.  Often times the bread is hard, but not here!  The bread was lightly toasted.. the perfect combination of crispy and slightly chewy.  The tomato, basil and balsamic vinaigrette was fresh and oh so delectable!  

I chose the Chicken Picata for my main dish, and although I don't eat meat, the chef and wait staff graciously substituted the chicken for angel hair pasta!  It had a nice side of crisply, cooked carrots and broccoli, a bed of angel hair pasta sauteed in white wine sauce with mushrooms, capers and artichokes, and some long grain moist lemon parsley rice white shredded carrots and kennels of corn.  I had snacked a bit before coming to dinner and ended up taking most of my meal to go.  

For dessert, I ordered a medium sized portion cup of Biscotto, so flavorful and creamy!!  I also tried the Pina Colada, loved the coconut and fresh taste, the Pink grapefruit, which was tart just like the fruit, strawberry cheesecake, which wasn't much of a fan.. I think it was too airy like whipped cream and strawberry syrup flavored.  I ended up eating my entire portion of Biscotto when I got home.. I just couldn't stop, it was so delicious!"}
{"text":"I went to this place for an early lunch and was the first customer as I went as soon as they opened. Ordered fettuccine alfredo pasta and philly cheese steak. We asked if they can make the alfredo pasta a bit spicy and the chef was kind enough to try some variations. When it came out, it was really good, creamy and a bit spicy finish! Would give 4 stars for the pasta!! 

The philly cheese steak was okay and the fries were good. Our server was nice but I am not sure about the other staffs. As we couldn't get her attention from our server for a check, we eye contacted with other staffs to ask to send us our server, but they didn't care. Other than that part, the food was good and service was good. Overall experience was 3 stars and a half."}
{"text":"Short version: Food was stellar, service was atrocious.

My group was quickly and easily sat in the private dining area as we had made reservations for Saturday night. Our group goes out quite frequently tog This was excellent and our group was happy to sit and start a round of cocktails.
Our orders were quickly taken and waters were brought for everyone. Then things started to go downhill.

Cocktails took quite awhile to come to the table - we were fine with this. However, when they did arrive the waiters were wrong about which cocktail was what. Our group solved the problem by tasting and determining which ones matched the  menu descriptions. I could understand if you did not remember who ordered which drink but please, at least know the name of the drink you are serving.

Ordering was quick and simple, some opted to do the restaurant week special while others simply picked an appetizer and an entree. We specifically asked if it was easier for us to all order at once, and was told it was.

The first food to come out was an appetizer and an entree for the same person! It was confusing and disappointing as they were unable to enjoy their food without it getting cold. 

Then about 5 minutes later everyone's appetizers came out and chaos ensued. The problem was the waiters did not know what food they were bringing out. No one had moved seats but they did not seem to know what food belonged to each seat either. Many dishes got mixed up and some extras that we had not ordered were some how also brought. The same problem occurred with the entrees.

The food was superb! Everyone really enjoyed every dish and the food was cooked to perfection. In particular I was incredibly impressed with the burger, and the salmon.

Since less of us had ordered dessert it was a little easier to get the dishes correct.

At this point we were more than ready to leave after a 2 hour dining experience. So we simply asked for our checks. It took 1.5 hours to get our checks. We offered to all line up at the register downstairs and go through our order and all pay just so we could leave. However, we were just simply held captive and frustrated. 

This ruined our entire dining experience. I'm beyond disappointed that I won't get to try more of the fantastic cocktails and dishes on the menu. I wouldn't even return with just my partner.

The majority of my group including myself have worked in the service industry and understand large groups can be complicated. We are easily understanding on a few mishaps or general slowness due to our size, however their were too many mistakes and too much confusion and our experience was completely ruined."}
{"text":"Tried Bella Fresco's for lunch today. Beautiful restaurant. Loved the tables, lighting and hanging terrariums. 

The chicken shawarma wrap was really good. But don't order it expecting it be like traditional chicken schwarma. It lacked the spices and being shaved like it would be in a Mediterranean place. 

The server Lorenzo was fabulous. Attentive and informative. Great service!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a truly delicious place. Not only is the food amazing, the atmosphere is very inviting and there is lovely outdoor seating .

I would recommend ordering one of the Philly cheese steaks. Though the  bread is a little different than what I normally find at places specializing in cheese steaks it is overall very good. Also, if you're looking for a place with good service, Bella Fresco has some of the best waiters I've seen. They are very fast and friendly.

Overall, Bella Fresco is a lovely cafe with good food, good service, and a welcoming atmosphere."}
{"text":"The food is delicious, the portions are generous, and the prices are great! What more could you ask for?

This place is a gem."}
{"text":"This new addition to the Arboretum is certainly welcomed!  I am offering a solid 4 stars strictly based on the Gelato.  It was AWESOME!!!  They had so many different flavors and I love the generous samples they provided.  I ended up getting two flavors in my dish--Pistachio and Almond...heavenly...vibrant flavoring, creamy, etc.  Well Done.

When I first walked in to this place I was underwhelmed.  There were all different stations (gelato, pizza, salad/pitas, wine/beer)...it was reminiscent of a Chinese buffet...just a lot going on.  But it was easy to figure out and everything made sense after I walked around for a minute.

I ended up trying one of their pita wraps to start.  They have a little make-your-own station for sandwiches and salads.  It was okay.  Everything was pretty fresh.  They grill the chicken right in front of you.  The chicken before it was grilled looked a little more like a rubber ducky from my nephews bathtub but I tried not to dwell on that.  Once the wrap was stuffed with all of the goodies I selected, it was pretty decent.

I also opted for the cucumber salad on the side and that was pretty good as well.

I think this is a great new addition to the Arbo...they are right by Akropolis so they have their competition cut out for them but I think they will hold their own.  

The service was friendly and you could visibly tell who the managers/owners were and they made sure everything was being handled properly.

I would advise coming here for lunch as the wraps weren't very filling OR to just get the Gelato because that was crazy good."}
{"text":"Upon arriving I was seated and checked out the menu & decided to go with the shrimp pizza. My server was nice, but overall the servers seemed very disorganized & the Manager/Owner? was overlooking everything correcting them, telling them things to change, etc. It didn't seem like the right time or pace to be doing so, with customers around. Although the service was slow the pizza was good, even though it was cold. I asked that it be re-heated and that helped. Served on a thick pita crust with cheese, olives, shrimp(only about 4) and a pesto sauce, very good. I would like to go back and give the other menu options a chance, as well as the gelato."}
{"text":"Oh boy!  We couldn't get in Cajun Yard Dog Saturday night so we tried this place. First clue should have been that there were plenty of empty tables. The service was painfully slow and the food was terrible. I got Greek   chicken with lemon potatoes.   The chicken was soooo dry. No flavor, no sauce, no pan drippings, it was horrible. The potatoes were diced so small that they too very over cooked and dried out. I had to fight to get them on my fork. The cucumber mint salad had no taste. I left 90% of my food. Husband got chicken piccata. We've never seen it look like that before. And again, no taste. The man that appeared to be the owner or manager was more interested in carrying on a  30 minute conversation in Greek with another associate and a female that he left with then checking to see why it took so long to get our food and why our drinks were empty. As soon as he left, the entire attitude of the staff changed. The associate he had been having the 30 minute conversation with sat on a table in the Gelato area. This is a table that is used to prep food on.   We should have just gone to Akropolis where the service is just as bad but at least the food is good."}
{"text":"I only stopped in to try the gelato and it was great! I got a berry flavor and tried a few others, all we're tasty with the right texture. Probably the closest you're going to get to Italy here in Charlotte.
The guys working the counters were so nice and even told us about the cute patio by the pond out back. Great customer service and great product!"}
{"text":"Bottomless mimosas, bloody Mary's, and bellinis on sat and sun. Brunch menu is pretty solid and not too many options."}
{"text":"After seeing the pictures on Yelp, I thought I was going to a fancy place when my dinner group met here but it's not fancy at all. Actually it's quite casual. It had a cafe / diner feel to it with booth seating, a gellato bar and food prep stations surrounding the back half of the restaurant.

The menu prices are decent. They have a good wine list and a small selection of craft beer. The food menu consists of Greek and Italian dishes. You can get an entree for $10! 

My friend and I shared the fallafel appetizer and a bottle of Chianti which were both delicious. We then couldn't decide on an entree so we shared the Lemon chicken and the Chicken Piccata. Both were good but the Lemon chicken was the star of this trip. Such wonderful flavor that danced in my mouth. 

The entree portion sizes are just enough - not huge like many places which make you think just one more bite and then you finish your meal eating enough for 2. But here it's plenty of food for one person and doesn't stuff you. Because you have to leave room for gellato. 

They have several flavors for gellato from raspberry to peanut butter. My friend went with the Reeses and I went with the tiramisu. Both were delicious and creamy.  

The worst thing about here is the service. There were a few flaws that made me consider dropping this to a 3-star review. We wanted to share appetizers around the table but had to ask for plates to share. They should have come out with or before the appetizers arrived. 2nd, we asked 3 times for refills on the water glasses but it never happened until our server was standing around staring like he needed to do something and saw water glasses were empty."}
{"text":"Aaron was great!! The service was awesome as soon as I walked through the door. Everyone, staff and owners, were attentive and full of personality. The food was perfect and the drinks were outstanding. I'll definitely be back!

Aaron makes a great Bloody Mary and he had great food and drink recommendations. I will be back and will bring my friends and family with me!"}
