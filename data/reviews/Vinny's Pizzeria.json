{"text":"The service alone at this place is worth going for. Our server, I think her name was Linda, was the friendliest, helpful, and ,most  tolerant server I've had in a long time. My kids were a bit of a handful (A spilled drink and ants in the pants throughout) and she was so easy going and awesome that we can't wait to go back. It's nice to eat out with our little monsters and know that the place doesn't mind the occasional downed drink or fussy 5 year old. The food was also fantastic, pizza sauce is amazing and the price is great (27.00 for four of us, drinks and all). We came on the recommendation of a friend and I think this is our new pizza spot. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"My family and I shared the Chicago style Pizza and a thin crust pizza . Both were good and service was good.    Live in Vegas and don't mind taking a drive for good food but the pizza here did not stand out to us like other pizza places.     Willing to try it again but unfortunately not willing to make the special trip for it ."}
{"text":"Horrible pizza! We think frozen pizza is even better. Food cold and I never got the water I asked for poor service. If your taken here after the Hoover dam tour go there's other options like chilly jillys or subway across the street"}
{"text":"We ordered for delivery and not onlY did it take 20 min longer than told it was wrong.  We called to complain and we were told the cooks didn't believe us and they needed the whole pizza back in exchange.  Since people had had slices I had to decline that and deal with the picky kid complaining they didn't get pizza.  Very poor service in my opinion.  Too bad we order Ed pizza from there often."}
{"text":"We have lived here for 6 months and finally made it to Vinny's for dinner.  Being an Italian from Chicago I was ready to be underwhelmed.  Boy was I wrong.  We fell in love with the place as soon as we walked in the door. The food was xlnt. Had the chicken parm and my wife had the baked spaghetti and bacon. Both were well made and delicious.   Loved it so much we called in an order for a delivery pizza two days later.  Thank you Vincenzo, we now have an Italian place to call our own.  See you soon."}
{"text":"Excellent homemade pizza, would recommend everyone, good selection of beer, nice prices"}
{"text":"We went in the other day to have lunch and it was great. We really enjoyed the Combination and Chicken Parm Sandwiches. The service was very friendly and polite. Glad you opened Vinny. Good Luck"}
{"text":"I'm from Illinois and this is very good pizza. Crust is perfect, sauce is great. The toppings were all very fresh. Service was great, just all in all a fantastic experience. Will defiantly go back."}
{"text":"Service was subpar to say the least. What eating establishment brings your dinner salad with your main course? The salad was good, wish I could say the same thing about the stuffed pizza. The edges were so overdone it was crumbled & some of it was even burnt. The inside was just barely hot enough to melt some of the cheese. The meat wasn't even warm. The sauce had good flavor but not worth what they charge. We expressed our unhappiness with the waitress who found it necessary to go tell another employee that was sitting down with a family eating, that we were mad. Not sure what her position was, but can recount the story she was sharing at the register about someone having prostate surgery as our food was being delivered. When we went to pay, we were asked how everything was. We shared our feelings & the fact we wouldn't be back. We were told \"that's too bad & the pizza gets overdone like that so the insides are cooked.\" I forgot to mention...they charge extra for deep dish. Never, ever again. Ever."}
{"text":"I'm a Pizza junkie. Saying that, Vinny's pizza is one of the best i've ate ever! Evev my wife, which is not a Pizza lover like me, admited it was wonderful and delicious. Service was great also.  Great experience, will definitely come here again."}
{"text":"I will forever be a loyal enthusiastic patron of Vinny's.  Today I ordered the spinach delight for delivery. The woman who took my order was great -- friendly and efficient. She said the pizza would be delivered in about 30 minutes.  After hanging up the phone I went outside to do something and found myself locked out! Tried everything short of breaking a window to get back in. No dice. The delivery driver from Vinny's pulled up and I told him I was locked out with no cash, so he should probably just take the pizza back. He did and I was hoping they'd find someone else to buy it so it wasn't wasted.  Less than 20 minutes later he was back, giving me the pizza, telling me to come in and pay when I could. I was so grateful.  Not only is the spinach delight pizza excellent but Vinny's goes above and beyond. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Came here as part of my bus tour. They mentioned that it had a good buffet. First of all the buffet has just a few options to choose from. The pizza in the buffet was cold. I make better pasta at home for my children. So far I LOVE Nevada, hate this over priced pizzeria!"}
{"text":"We had the pizza, pasta, salad buffet after our Hoover Dam tour. I've never had pizza that was so bad. The crust was just blah. It was equivalent to cafeteria food. The pasta sauce on the pasta was also not good. Ragu canned sauce tastes better than that. At $10 a pop, I felt ripped off. I don't know why Food Network went here. It just sucked."}
{"text":"U can tell this guy is from Chicago and not new York! People out there don't know any better. Horrible food!  The owners wife dresses like a slob!"}
{"text":"Went to the bathroom and above the toilet was a painting of a bullseye saying we aim to please.  Do I need to say anymore?"}
{"text":"Pizza with spaghetti baked in it. Sounds weird. Tastes awesome! Friendly folks n good food!"}
{"text":"This pizza place is our favorite pizza place in town! The staff is always friendly and the food is consistently delicious!"}
{"text":"Drove up to the restaurant without reading the reviews on YELP, until after I finished my meal. This is Italian Americana how it should be, perfectly prepared eggplant pasta and not a big fan of eggplant. Perfect service and totally satisfied. Back in Boulder City again? I'LL BE BACK."}
{"text":"Ate there twice.... Atmosphere was bad..... Pizza was gross.... Sorry... Gave it a chance..."}
{"text":"Pizza was strangely sweet frys were soggy just overall bad. Tony's is way better if you're in Boulder."}
{"text":"I am from Northern Illinois originally and this is the closest thing to back home.  Every time it is consistent and flavorful.   The owner is great makes you feel like home.  Try the lasagna or pizza you won't be upset.  It is worth the drive from north las vegas with the great prices compared to the over priced crap in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"Pretty good. Wish they offered a thinner, crispier crust though. Very nice people to speak on the phone with, delivery is pretty quick."}
{"text":"Muy bueno los espaguetis y el cheese ravioli también !!!! Recomendable 100% si vuelves de visitar el grand canyon o hoover dam y vas en direccion las vegas. Comida buena y abundante, buen trato y rapidez en el servicio."}
{"text":"My family has been to this restaurant on a few different occasions.  We've tried the pizza, lasagna and the spaghetti.  All were yummy delicious.  They have quick service with friendly and attentive servers."}
{"text":"Epic fail. If a tour bus stops at the place at a scheduled  time, you would think they would be prepared.  Food was lousy pizza tasted previously made. And when I asked the waitress what she had just put  out at the \"appetizer\" bar, she totally ignored me.  There was no mention of a lunch stop  during the tour till after  we were on the bus. Very irritating, and we had to pay for it in addition to the  tour."}
{"text":"Amazing! We joined family to try this place out for the first time, and boy was it delicious! We ordered 2 med pizzas, chicken wings, chicken fingers, fried zucchini, mozzarella sticks, and kids spaghetti. The pizza tasted like it was all homemade. The ranch tasted homemade- there was not a single complaint from us. The service was on point- friendly staff, and our drinks stayed full. Highly recommended this restaurant."}
{"text":"Big Dam Pizza is my choice.Super friendly wait staff.Vinny does a great service to all in the community as well."}
{"text":"Never had we ordered from Vinnie's Pizza, I called in to place an order for delivery. Tina, answered the phone. She was extremely pleasant and explained all the different pizzas, salad, wings and more to me! Sounded all really good and I can't wait to try the pizza we ordered. If the food is as good as the service, then I think we have a winner!"}
{"text":"The service was 5 star, the pizza was one star. The thin crust pizza tasted like pre frozen cardboard. Crunchy-no chewiness, with just a few  flakes of cheese. Pizza sauce was overly sweet top thick would prefer a lighter fresh tomato taste. Would not order that again, but might try a pasta dish IF we ever return."}
{"text":"We were just passing through Boulder City and wanted pizza for dinner.  So glad I saw this place and we stopped.  Great thin crust pizza.  Ask for the specials. I had a large two topping pizza for only $9.99.  Their hot giardiniera topping is very good with great flavor.  I would totally go again if we ever pass through here again."}
{"text":"Hoover Dam Tour from Grand Canyon stops here after the tour. This might be a racket. Pizza is of the same quality as Cici's."}
{"text":"So, this was part of our tour package. They tell you the place was on Food network, but it was restaurant stakeout. Which if any of you know, is really not a positive thing. My two other friends ate the buffet and this was the first day of our trip. By 4 am they were projectile vomiting. Thanks!! I would give you a negative google star worth, but hey not an option."}
{"text":"AMAZING!! First time eating here and will defiantly be back for more! Five of us got the Dam size pizza split into 4 different toppings! All delicious! Can't beat the amazing prices! Staff and our waitress made the experience a good one! Super friendly! Restaurant was super easy to find and clean! Feels like you're at home and made us feel welcome! Loved it!"}
{"text":"Thought I would give this little Pizzeria a try, best decision ever!!! Such an authentic and DELICIOUS menu, family friendly and the most friendly staff you will ever meet! I will definitely recommend to family, friends and my Real Estate clients!"}
{"text":"Awsome! Been back a few times.  The fried calzone is unique and really good!  I love their sauce,  it's just right,  and the staff is always friendly.  I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza!  We got a thin crust Supremo and couldn't be happier with it. When I called in the order, they said 45 minutes but it took less than 30 minutes. We will probably go there next time instead of asking for delivery so we can see what else they have that's good."}
{"text":"We are Realtors and live in Boulder City. Being Italian,  53 Y.O. and from NY, my wife and I have eaten a lot of Italian Food and many Restaurants. Ashley was our waitress and brought out our thin crust (pep/mushroom) pizza at the same time as our salad and offered to keep pizza hot or salad cold but it was a turn off wanting a good experience. Pizza was OK...not bad...the dough had no flavor. Salad was just Ice Berg with a few diced pcs of tomato and olives...not very appetizing. We did get as many refills on the soda we ordered. Ashley did not ask if I wanted Coffee or Desert and if I wanted something to wrap up the left over pizza...just dropped off bill and never saw here again. No apology for bringing out pizza and salad at same time. A free Cannoli would have been a nice touch but no.  I see no reason to go back. We were not made to feel appreciated or that welcome. It's to bad because we are locals and know hundreds of people and real estate clients. There's another pizza place in town and at College Dr. that's real good and I can make my own Italian Food. So sad.  Was really looking forward to nice experience."}
{"text":"Amazing friendly dervice, delicious perfectly cooked food, and nice family atmosphere typical pizza restaurant menu great prices I highly recommend this restaurant and we'll be coming back again"}
{"text":"Amazing service and amazing food. Staff always friendly. We have been there several times but they also deliver if you don't want to go out. Quick delivery. If you are feeding a crowd they have a huge pizza called \"the big dam\" pizza. You can get it split four ways with different toppings so everyone will be happy."}
{"text":"Like many others, we came after the Hoover Dam tour. We got here right at 1:00 with a  full bus of people. My boyfriend I were the first to order our drinks, and the last to receive them, after we'd already finished an entire plate of food each from the buffet.   Before receiving my Sierra mist, I noticed a young girl got a Sierra Mist, looked at it puzzled, and took a sip. As I got my Sierra mist, I noticed she suddenly had a Mountain Dew. As I was about to take a sip of my drink, the little girl and her brother looked at me and giggled. I then realized my drink had been take to the wrong table, the girl drank out of it, then it was given to me. Even McDonald's throws out food given to the wrong person, bur not this place.   The rest of the food wasn't very good either. Wouldn't come back here, even if it was free."}
{"text":"As a previous yelper indicated this was a designated stop for lunch by the Hoover dam tour company.  We were told that there is a link between the owners of the tour company and the owner's of Vinny's (relatives)  This restaurant is on a strip mall with little competition as our bus pulled up by all indication they were expecting us.  We were seated fast because it was practically empty perhaps if it was not for the forced stop Vinny's might not be in business? Some of the waitress were wearing a \"featured on food network\" t -shirt.  I asked them about it and they said they were featured on restaurant stakeout.....I don't think it's something you would brag about since the premise of the show is to save a floundering restaurant.  Okay let me get back to the food - my husband ordered a med pizza and ended up offering it to the bus driver because it was not worth bringing back.  He said it had no taste and the quality was lacking.  Nope we would not stop here again on our own accord. Hey forgot the service was friendly and fast..."}
{"text":"I had the meatball and garlic bread for lunch. Four giant meatballs in a nice thick tomato sauce. It was good and just the right portion. The three star because we were part of the Hoover Dam tour and there were many of us. The restaurant did its best to work as quickly as possible that our food came out lukewarm."}
{"text":"Went to see the Hoover Dam today with the family. I didn't want to try the Dam Pizza (lol), because I knew I would be going to Vinny's after the Dam tour(lol). Ok, sorry... no more Dam jokes(lol). Anyways, we stop at Vinny's and it honestly the best quality pizza, I've had. I didn't eat the buffey pizza, so I can't tell you about that. My wife did, and she liked it. I ordered a pizza from the menu. Cooked to order and just awesome. If you like authentic italian pizza... this is the place. I spoke with Vinny, and he mentioned about setting up shop in Anaheim, CA. I hope he does. Great quality pizza. I now see why they were featured on the Food Network. If you're going on a Dam tour, stop by at Vinny's Pizzeria."}
{"text":"Service was great!!! Restaurant was clean, including the bathroom!!! Pizza was delicious, accurately described on the menu! I had a great experience. They also have benches for outdoor seating, that was pretty nice!"}
{"text":"Love stopping here on the way to Vegas from Phoenix.  The thin crust is awesome and the sauce is just right"}
{"text":"Order their so called \"Chicago Style\" pizza with sausage. I know you must be thinking that sausage is THE ingredient for Chicago style pizza. I really wished that the pizza was good. I really do. But the pizza was far from good. It was what appeared to be an attempt at a deep dish pizza. The sauce was super sweet and there was very little of it on the pizza. The cheese was piled on like it was the last pizza of the night and there was going to be a small amount if cheese left in the bin so the hell with it, toss all of it on. The cheese was not even melted all the way through. You could see the individual shredded cheese pieces. Last but not least, the sausage was not a good quality as you would expect from a pizzeria touting their Chicago style of pizza making. Overall, I would put the quality above that of dominoes but below that of Pizza Hut and Tony's which is pretty bad since Tony's and Pizza Hut do not get my business either. It is a shame that I have to drive into Vegas or Henderson for decent quality pizza."}
{"text":"We were taken to this place after our Hoover Dam Tour. Heard the tour guide sing its praises, i.e. It was on The Food Network. Being from New York, WE know pizza!!!  Not a fan of Chicago Pizza. I did not like this pizza, i didn't understand the crust or the sauce. I found it to be soggy and not worth the $5.00 and it was a small piece."}
{"text":"It's a nice atmosphere (very Rte 66, Americana feel like a lot of Boulder City) but the food is mediocre."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza  chicken and jalapeño it was great  I didn't know it was thin crust  pizza but its was good  The toppings was very less need to order double."}
{"text":"Vinny's is so good! Very friendly staff and the food is made fresh! We stopped in and had their lunch buffet. $8 for all you can eat pizza, salad and pasta, it totally blows any other pizza place away. I would recommend this place to anyone who's looking for a great, friendly place to eat while in Boulder City!"}
{"text":"Terrible. The pizza buffet is very low quality. The \"breadsticks\" are toasted buns, the \"pasta\" is just noodles with marinara sauce, the \"calzones\" are dough stuffed with cheese, and the pizza tastes like stale crust. We sat at the bar. She took my husband's drink order (I wanted to look at the drink menu) and she never came back. A different waitress dropped off our check, so quickly that I couldn't order my first and only drink. I had to order my drink after we walked up to the register to pay. We took so long that our tour bus driver came looking for us. I understand being busy but she NEVER CAME BACK. Yet she offered water refills in to-go cups to the tables behind us. This place isn't worth a minute of your time."}
{"text":"We did our end of season basketball party here. To be such a small spot they did a great job accommodating our team of savage, testosterone driven young men, and all the parents as well. We pre-booked so when we arrived it wasnt long before the ZA come out nice and warm. We had some huge pizzas. (sorry I didn't have time for pics, the boys went at it pretty quickly).   The lady helping us was nice and didn't allow the kids to frustrate her at all. She kept the coca cola and lemonade pitchers full and the parmesan and hot crushed peppers loaded. The have a decent selection of \"adult beverages\" if you need a little something to take the edge off :)   This is another one of those small businesses that I definitely think is worth supporting. The pizza was about a 3.5 but some of the other menu items were definitely 4's or 5's. An easy 4 stars for Vinny's."}
{"text":"Probably the worst customer experience I've had in a long time. Buffet had 4 pizzas half picked over when the tour bus got here. The same bus comes at the SAME TIME EVERYDAY! you would think that the restaurant with guaranteed business everyday from the bus tours could capitalize and get an additional oven.  Pizza was average would not put the world famous title in front of it for any reason at all. Waiting staff were all very friendly and had no control over the kitchen.  Also had no noon meat options for those who choose not to eat whether for religious or non religious reasons. Food network sign should honestly be taken down."}
{"text":"The prices are very reasonable and they do free delivery in Boulder City. Their sauce is a little sweet for my taste but a pinch of salt is an easy fix. Can't go wrong with their baked spaghetti or salads. Great customer service which always makes the food taste better. I've had their pizza once and need to try more, however, their sauce-cheese-topping ratio was perfect."}
{"text":"At first I was skeptical about stopping since there wasn't really anyone in the spaghetti place but my husband being a spaghetti fanatic convinced me to go and I am so happy he did the service is beyond excellent everyone is very friendly and family oriented I would highly recommend this place to anybody in town they even went out of their way to look and call a few places to stay the night near the area very knowledgeable about the Hoover Dam and places to stay. Are very kid friendly offered my kids coloring books and games they have. now the food I ordered a Hawaiian pizza which was very good and tried their spaghetti Italian sausage Alfredo we're all excellent. For a family of 5 very reasonable pricing"}
{"text":"This pizza place was good but in the last few months the quality of the food is hit and miss. The last three orders I have placed with them one pizza I had to throw out . . . completely inedible . . . and two of the pies in the last order look as if they had been cut by someone on meth. Well it goes to show that all products as well as businesses have a life cycle."}
{"text":"Well on the way back from Hoover Dam, this stop was part of the package.  We had really already had lunch but what the heck, we're  game, WOW what a let down.  I check out the pizza buffet, about all we had time for.  The pizza look terrible.  Glad we passed on it, so why not try some cheese cake.  After a long wait well I had to remind the waitress to bring out the cheese cake.  Well out came two piece, one was FROZEN, well we were able to fork it apart.  The other piece seemed to have been warmed up.  Holy cow this was no better then bought at a box store or at a warehouse cheese cake.  After hunting down the waitress so we could pay, she gave me the wrong ticket, I did notice a man sitting by himself at the bar, he had a veteran hat on.  So it was my chance to pay it forward today, so I paid his tab.  BUT THIS PLACE IS NO BIG THING.  GO UP THE ROAD FOR A&W."}
{"text":"We had the Spinach Delight deep dish stuffed pizza. Amazing!!! Easily one of the best pizzas I've ever had. The sauce is delightfully sweet and herby at the same time.  The pizza was cooked well; however, a tad underdone in places on the bottom of the \"pie\". However,  this didn't negatively affect the pizza at all considering how tasty it was. The only downside is that we'll probably never be back to enjoy this delicious pizza!"}
{"text":"The pizza was not to bad, the buffet, had great choice of pizza, pasta salade, but only one dessert, jello, would have elite to Sen at least a couple more options. The fried zucchini was great."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Boulder City. Very cheesy, generous toppings, and quick service. The only negative may be that the pizza sauce is a little too sweet."}
{"text":"Stopped here after the Hoover Dam Tour, if you're going to partner with a tour company then you should probably know how to manage an flood of people coming in at the same time.  Pros: the meatball sandwich was really good Cons: the wait staff and here is why - left one table with only half the order taken, completely overlooked taking orders from two other tables (including mine), they would run away from your table as soon as you amazed one question, they would disappear back into the kitchen or whatever, they didn't use trays to deliver drinks or anything so it'd take multiple trips to serve parties larger than 2, no one took responsibility for any delays or mistakes (brought the wrong drink, ordered the exact same food as the table next to us before they did, they were served first. All this when the tour group only gives a bus load of people 45 min to complete the dining experience and be back on the bus.  My suggestion is if the tour wants to stay in business they should quit this partnership and have people either eat at the Hoover Dam Cafe, or bring their lunch."}
{"text":"Lunch buffet is $10.81, tax-in. Unlimited pizza, garlic bread, rigatoni and salad (iceberg lettuce). Not bad for what it is -- we came here with a tour after visiting the Hoover Dam, which is where I suspect where most of their business comes from."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is always pleasant, we usually have Linda wait on us, she's a gem!!  The food is excellent, the Chicago Style Deep Dish pizza is fantastic!!!  We have a daughter who is a celiac and has a dairy allergy, but she can have their gluten free pizza (delicious!!!) without cheese and it's the best gluten free pizza around.  They're very conscious of her special food needs, there has never been an issue with cross contamination, which has been a problem at other restaurants.  Vinny's is an all around pleasant place to go eat.  Would highly recommend it to anyone. The menu is varied enough that anyone can find something they like."}
{"text":"Traveling and ordered delivery from her from my hotel. Asked what was their best pasta and was told the homemade lasagna. Also ordered a Stromboli... the lasagna was not fresh cold lasagna with piping hot sauce and melted cheese on the top. The lasagna noodles were grey and the cheese inside was not existent between the layers I am assuming due to its age. The Stromboli was fresh ingredients seemingly but the dough was thick and completely uncooked. All inedible. Wow. Refund would be nice."}
{"text":"This great little place serves authentic Chicago style Italian cuisine. The house calzone is filled with Cheese, Bacon, Sausage, Onions, BBQ Sauce and is baked to perfection. They have a nice selection of beers and a seat at the bar is perfect for those dining alone."}
{"text":"Vinny's pizza is the bomb - especially the vegetarian deep dish. It's the only pizza place we'll go to in Boulder City (by far...really far)!  We also tried the Ham & Pineapple recently - you can never go wrong with that and they didn't. My friend ordered pasta and so we had a chance to try the garlic bread, too. High marks!"}
{"text":"Oh my - This use to be my favorite place to eat pizza when I was in BC, haven't been there for over 6 months - I was looking forward to it - but it was a big mistake! The pizza was almost pure sugar ( that is to the sauce was way too sweet) really doesn't anybody check their product before they sell ? And then we order spumoni ice cream- it was served to use as a bowl of soup -really questioned what the server was thinking when she set it down in front of us-  sad this restaurant seems to lack motivation to be better then the rest - now it is just ok - will not be back :("}
{"text":"Great pizza and friendly service. Great place to stop to miss traffic when coming back to LV from the lake."}
{"text":"This was our lunch stop after visiting the Hoover Dam. We were told we had 45 minutes to eat, then back on the bus.  Most people had the buffet,  the pizza was cold,  so was the pasta.  Was it worth the money?  No. But it was cheaper than eating on the Vegas Strip."}
{"text":"I did not eat here - this is for business practices.  We had a forced, unannounced until we were on the tour bus, stop here.  Seriously, nothing in the tour literature mentioned a stop here, which was half a long as the stop at the Hoover Dam.  I wouldn't set foot in a place that would treat people in such a fashion.  Luckily for us a placed called Chilly Jilly's is across the parking lot, which was a seriously yummy chicken joint"}
{"text":"People!  This is a pizza buffet with salad pasta and pizza for only $10 a person!  No, it's no 5 star restaurant but it is very filling, a great value, and the staff is very efficient and got our entire tour bus out and in rapidly and were friendly!  The pizza is much better than cicis-you can tell the dough is homemade even!  Thin crust and good sauce.  Don't be afraid to eat here-it's a great value for the money and the quality is fine"}
{"text":"My husband and I have gone to Vinny's a few times since it has opened. The service has definitely improved since it opened. Our server Sam was very nice and helpful. Our food was even better. We ordered a spaghetti stuffed pizza and asked them to add meatballs. It was AMAZING. I will definitely try more stuffed pizzas!!"}
{"text":"On the tour bus to Hoover Dam, we were told we were going to stop at Vinny's for lunch on the way back. It had a decent rating on Yelp and Vinny's was proud to advertise that they had been on Food Network. So when we arrived, the servers were ready to handle a group and take order and get refills and our check in a timely manner. They were very good at handling groups. I appreciated this. For this reason alone, I would have given Vinny's 4 stars. The problem was was that the pizza and pasta in the buffet wasn't that great. I know they weren't on the Food Network because of the great service, but it certainly couldn't have been for the food. The pizza was bland and boring. I looked at the pasta and didn't want to have any. The salad base was just iceberg and I hate iceberg. Overall, this \"featured on Food Network\" food was not anything I would make a return visit for. Either find someplace else in Boulder City to eat, or wait until you get back to Vegas."}
{"text":"While visiting Hoover Dam we stopped and had lunch at Vinny's arriving just as a tourist bus was departing Vinny's.  The staff cleaned up from the approximate 100 departing guests while taking prompt care of our party. The food was very good, service above expectation. We liked it enough that we returned today and had a similar experience. Vinny's, great pizza and service from a home town, family run pizza parlor."}
{"text":"Visited this place as part of the Hoover Dam tour.  Calling it a Pizzeria is misleading to say the least.  The salad bar consisted of a bowl of lettuce, a few toppings and a few dressings.  The pitiful pizza pies were either pre-made or they used the poorest of ingredients to create them.  Also on the buffet was a pan of onion rings, chicken nuggets, fried zucchini, sad sad pasta and some other items I didn't find appetizing.  The cokes were strong and ice cold...refreshing!  Staff was courteous.  Should I visit Boulder City again (which I'm sure I will) I won't be returning to this place."}
{"text":"Great food!! The pizza crust is amazing. My favotite is the Great White, but now they have added wings to their menu too and now my husband is now all about their wings lol! By far some of the best pizza I've had and I'm lucky enough to have it right here in my little town. Best pizza in vegas is actually in Boulder City"}
{"text":"Hoover dam tour brought us here on the way back. The food was great, the waitstaff was very efficient and polite and the prices weren't that bad."}
{"text":"We had two fabulous meals with exceptional service. Our servers, Ashley and Regina went above and beyond to meet our needs. The pizza was outstanding and lasagna and Alfredo tasted like they were home cooked. Thanks, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Hot delicious and on time! Recently we had some friends over and ordered pizza from Vinny's knowing it was new. We were very happy with the speed of the delivery and the fresh and delicious vegetarian pizza we shared. Best of luck to Vinny's - looking forward to trying the restaurant soon!"}
{"text":"The food and service are great. It's a little more expensive that your average pizza joint though. I think the extra price is worth it however."}
{"text":"Showed up 25 minutes before closing the other night and we were not greeted very well, everyone looked at us like \"you have got to be kidding me\", clearly we left immediately.  Poor customer service, you are a food establishment, until your doors are closed you should be serving customers."}
{"text":"I love this place! Vinny, Tina and staff were very accommodating to our vegan requests and made a super stacked cheeseless veggie pizza. Nice to see gluten friendly on the menu too. We were in town for a Vegas wedding so it was nice to pop a seat up at the bar and feel like we were back home in a Chicago style pizza pub. The place is family owned and you can tell they put a lot of love into running the place."}
{"text":"Great local pizza joint in Boulder City. The steak and cheese pizza is one of my favorites, their lasagna is one of my husband's. Definitely the best pizza and Italian choice in our small town of BC."}
{"text":"We stopped at Vinnys Pizza after our Hoover Dam trip.  I was pretty excited to try a restrauant that was seen on the food network.   We got there, sat down and the waitress took our drink order, she told us she would be back to take our food order.  We got our drink, and the server never returned to take our food order.  So we paid for our drink and got back on the bus. TIP. If you want to order something other than the buffet, you may not be able too very easily, so order when you order your drinks."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time...this restaurant was a part of the Hoover Dam tour we went on today. The resturant brags about being on the Food Network; however, after a little research, it was because they were going out of business and was featured on Restaurant Steakout. The quality of the food is terrible; CiCi's Pizza is better.    I'm giving ** because of the nice waitress."}
{"text":"This was the designated lunch stop on our Hoover Dam tour.  They were featured on Food Network, a fact they're capitalizing on everywhere you look in the place.  Me and my boyfriend both ordered the garlic bread and 4 meatballs for lunch - so good. The sauce was everything it should be, and not too sour or sweet. Good Italian is a dime a dozen around where I'm from (Connecticut) so despite not having an Italian bone in my body I know what constitutes good, ha.  The pizza looked good, it was thin crust, but unless it's brick oven fired and burnt to a crisp like Frank Pepes in New Haven, CT I tend to skip it.  Best of all, the prices were pretty cheap. Didn't look at the actual menu, stuck to the special tour one but nothing looked unreasonable."}
{"text":"If you are one of those people like me who just don't understand the praise Olive Garden gets here in Nevada you can rest now. This place provides Italian food the way it should be, no acidic jarred sauce,  no reheated frozen junk and no skimpy portions.  The calzone is HUGE, seriously bring an appetite. I had the eggplant and had to bring 1/2 of it home there was so much, which is great, more for the money. :) The batter for the fried items is really good they have onion rings, mushrooms and even cauliflower. They have french fries served with the sandwiches, very good metalballs. The salad that comes with meals is a good size and fresh.  The chicago and stuffed pizzas look HUGE and totally worth the money. They also have skinny pizza available.  Nice menu choices and there is also a daily special.  I recommend this place, affordable and much better than chain restaurants who can't cook sauce... Casual and comfortable, no long waits. There is carry out, delivery and eat in. Good luck Vinny."}
{"text":"Place wasn't too bad.. Had some nice decor for being half bar and half restaurant. Ordered baked ziti but they didn't have that so i got baked mascotti with meat sauce and it came with a side salad (they charged extra for meat and cheese). Overall the baked pasta was good (sauce was sweet, like prego). I also ordered a cheese slice. The cheese slice was like a personal pizza but it wasn't to my taste. The slice was almost like a square shape and i thought that the crust was too thick as well as being dry/burnt.  Also for the people that eat glutten free stuff. For glutten free pizza, the dough or the actual pizza is ordered from some place (someone was talking about it). Not sure if the regular pizza is ordered or not."}
{"text":"Thankful to have a \"taste of home\" out here.  We have tried many pizza places since moving here from IL 3 years ago - NONE are nearly as good, consistent or as fair priced as \"Vinny's!"}
{"text":"This place was tasty with a friendly staff. We ordered off a \"smaller\" menu. I had a meatball sub and it was HUGE! The fries were hot and fresh as well. My husband had the buffet & enjoyed all the pizza!"}
{"text":"Just like many others, we stopped here on the way to the Grand Canyon. Wow! Honestly, best pizza I've had. Their pasta also looked great, but we just got a large pizza. They have an entire pizza sandwiched with cheese as the \"stuffed dish\". As amazing as that sounds, thought it might be too much so I asked for just the crust to be stuffed. This isnt on the menu, but they'll do it for you and you won't regret it. Amazing! The waiting staff was adorable and so friendly. I could use a spot like this at home. 3 1/2 stars is not enough for this place!"}
{"text":"So I just had my first Chicago deep dish and it was amazing ! Left me wanting to find something similar here! We called and ordered a Chicago pizza and they said 10-15 minutes...um Chicago Pizza takes 40 minutes min.  We figured it is Mother's Day we would try it. Came home the boys said they LOVED said they loved it...and it \"tastes just like Chuck E. Cheese\" that pretty much sums it up...super sweet."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner. The pizza is great! However. I would recommend ordering take out instead of dining in. The service it self was poor. Our waitress was a bit on the rude side. A few different things we tried to order were out. I understand being out of stock once in a while but not with multiple things.  The prices are decent as far as the pizza goes. The rest, a bit overpriced. Also out only get one free refill on your $2.00 drink.   I would eat here again. Just not inside the shop."}
{"text":"First of all, I have been in the service industry my whole life and would never tell a customer that they are wrong, especially if I was the owner of a restaurant in a small town. The food is mediocre and inconsistent. Delivery took nearly an hour, the food was luke warm and food was missing. All of this should be taken into concern and then the fact that the delivery location is less than a city block from the store. My office will no longer be ordering from Vinny's which means we won't miss our lunch breaks again.  Rude. Inconsistent. Slow."}
{"text":"Horrible pizza!! Took way to long and they weren't even busy. The waitress never came back to check on us after we received our food, we had to go track her down to get our check and a to go box then she wanted to box our pizza in the back.... Uh hell no!!! 20 minutes later (no exaggeration) we finally got it and left!!"}
